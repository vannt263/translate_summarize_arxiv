    "one of the most sensational discoveries of the past decade is that the expansion of the universe is speeding up .",
    "this observation finds support in the luminosity measurements of high redshift supernovae @xcite and measurements of degree - scale anisotropies in the cmb @xcite .",
    "general relativity leads to a deceleration of the expansion for the universe if filled with cold matter or radiation .",
    "since the expansion is speeding up , we are faced with two possibilities : the first is that 70 percent of the energy density of the universe exists in a form with large negative pressure , called dark energy .",
    "the other possibility is that general relativity breaks down on the cosmological scales and should be modified or replaced with a more complicated theory .",
    "various forms of modification of gravity have been proposed to explain the late time acceleration of the universe . in an interesting development , deffayet , dvali and",
    "gabadadze @xcite demonstrated that the presence of the 4d ricci scalar term in the action functional for the brane can lead to a late time acceleration @xcite .",
    "the possibility that branes can naturally produce a solution to unsolved problems in gravity and cosmology , such as dark energy will generate a great boost aside from being a significant achievement in the theory and a good verification of the extra dimensions idea .",
    "with all the success that brane gravity models have achieved major weak points exist as follows ;    * the nature of phenomenological model building most of these theories have .",
    "* most of the developments are specific to particular models .",
    "for example , this has given the wrong impression that the brane program is necessarily a 5d theory based on the ads5 or ricci flat bulk .",
    "* the geometric mechanism , like kaluza - klein ( kk ) and multidimensional gravitational models , for unification of fundamental forces , using group of isometries of non - compact bulk space is not well developed .",
    "+ the general theory of relativity provides a geometric description of gravitational fields . after einstein work",
    ", physicists have been looking for a classical unified field theory ( uft ) which would describe other fundamental interactions in terms of geometric concepts of spacetime .",
    "the first attempt to set up such a uft using the concept of adding spacelike extra dimension was that of kaluza and klein @xcite . in kk and its multidimensional extensions",
    "the extra dimensions form a compact coset space @xmath0 for a given gauge group @xmath1 and a maximal subgroup @xmath2 .",
    "consequently coordinate transformations associated with the compact manifold can be interpreted as gauge transformations .",
    "+ in brane scenarios the restriction on the size of the extra dimension is weaker .",
    "standard model and matter fields are confined to some hypersurface embedded in the bulk space . to achieve geometrical unification",
    "it is enough to consider an @xmath3-dimensional brane with @xmath4 compact coset space embedded in @xmath5-dimensional bulk space @xcite .",
    "the basic difficulties of such brane models , like the original kk multidimensional theories , are the compactification of internal space , the problem of vacuum stability for the ground state , the large fermion masses which appear in nonzero modes @xcite and the gauge fields appearing as the dimensional reduction are not confined to the brane and can propagate in the bulk @xcite . to avoid some of the problems",
    "mentioned we need to find another geometrical origin for the gauge group of maxwell - yang - mills interactions .",
    "* a simplifying assumption has been to consider the brane as highly thin .",
    "this approximation is assumed to be valid as long as the energy scales are much smaller than the energy scales related to the inverse thickness of the brane , or at distance scales much bigger than the thickness of the brane @xcite .",
    "+ most of the studies are restricted to thin brane models where the standard model matter fields are infinitely localized on a brane with delta - like distribution .",
    "this kind of models can , however , be only treated as an approximation since the most fundamental underlying theory ( like string and quantum gravity theories ) would have a minimum length scale . also as we know , for confined standard model matter fields we have `` hadron barrier '' which could be encountered .",
    "such barrier could arise because all hadrons couple via the strong interaction to low mass mesons @xcite .",
    "hence the minimum size of any physical system containing nucleons can not be appreciably less than the range of the strong interactions @xcite . the final point",
    "to note is that in thin brane approximation , in approaching the brane usually self - interactions of gravitons are divergent and consequently the justification of confined matter interactions is impossible .",
    "consideration of a brane thickness in such models is an essential ingredient to play the role of an effective uv cut - off @xcite .    *",
    "the main difficulty in applying a junction condition is that it is not unique .",
    "other forms of junction conditions exist , so that different conditions may lead to different physical results @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these conditions can not be used in the presence of more than one noncompact extra dimension .",
    "* the dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) brane model which contains self acceleration , the joint constraints from snls , bao , and cmb data shows that this model is disfavored observationally @xcite .",
    "moreover the dgp model contains a ghost mode for the branch of the self acceleration @xcite .    in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , the authors proposed a cosmological model for a @xmath6 brane embedded in a bulk space with arbitrary large extra dimensions where the matter fields are confined to the brane . as a result ,",
    "an extra term in the friedmann equation appeared that may be interpreted as the x - matter , providing a possible phenomenological explanation for the acceleration of the universe . in this paper , we have studied the covariant ( model independent ) induced einstein - yang - mills field equations on a 4-dimensional brane embedded isometrically in d - dimensional bulk space .",
    "the embedding is a necessity to make the riemann curvature more consistent with the purpose of distinguishing a curved space - time from the flat space of special relativity .",
    "indeed , riemann mentions in his historical paper that his curvature can not distinguish between a plane or a cylinder or a cone .",
    "this problem ( which is in fact a topological problem in the sense of shape ) was left open and a solution of it was presented by schlfli in 1871 , based on the reasoning that the local curvature can not be an absolute concept as riemann proposed .",
    "the curvature as a notion of shape is a relative concept , which is valid only when we have a second object to compare .",
    "therefore , schlfli suggested the isometric embedding of a manifold into another , so that we could always compare the curvature of that manifold with the curvature of the embedding space .",
    "the isometric condition is to guarantee that the metric of the embedded manifold is induced by the background . in our model ,",
    "the extrinsic curvature plays the role of an independent field in describing dark energy .",
    "in fact , to have a common origin for the gravitational and yang - mills interactions we need a @xmath7 bulk space and consequently , the israel junction conditions are not applicable . also , to include the thickness of the brane we use the nash s theorem for perturbations of the submanifolds @xcite , where the extrinsic curvature and twist vector fields also play a dynamical role .",
    "nash showed that any riemannian geometry can be generated by a continuous sequence of infinitesimal deformations defined by the extrinsic curvature .",
    "some popular brane - world models use m - theory motivations and use additional postulates such as a @xmath8 symmetry across the brane as in the randall - sundrum models @xcite .",
    "this symmetry was not considered in this paper as essential since the @xmath8 symmetry breaks the regularity of the embedding , thus preventing the use of the perturbation mechanism of nash s theorem .",
    "an effective einstein - hilbert action functional for the @xmath6 spacetime @xmath9 embedded in a @xmath10-dimensional ambient ( bulk ) space @xmath11 may be derived from the action @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the bulk space energy scale and @xmath14 is the lagrangian of matter fields confined to the brane with thickness @xmath15 .",
    "this means that we no longer treat the confined energy - momentum tensor as a singular source , but rather as some smooth distribution along thickness of brane @xcite .",

    ", tev gravitons can propagate on the bulk space freely . to construct geometrical properties of the model ,",
    "we start with the local isometric embedding structure , consistent with differential structure of einstein field equations ( [ 1 - 2 ] ) .     to obtain a local and isometric embedding , consider the @xmath10-dimensional lorentzian bulk space @xmath24 with local coordinates @xmath25 , endowed with a metric @xmath26 .",
    "further , consider in @xmath27 a @xmath6 submanifold @xmath28 with local coordinates @xmath29 and induced metric @xmath30 .",
    "we can then construct an adopted coordinate system in the bulk space which includes the local coordinates of submanifold @xmath31 as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 are extrinsic or extra coordinates .",
    "in such a condition the submanifold @xmath31 is defined by @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , the isometric local embedding of a given spacetime @xmath35 with induced metric @xmath36 @xmath37 in an arbitrary bulk @xmath11 , is given by @xmath10 differential maps @xmath38 also , the vectors @xmath39 form a basis of tangent and normal vector spaces respectively at each point of @xmath35 , where small latin indices denotes extra dimensions and @xmath40 denotes the components of @xmath41 unit vector fields orthogonal to the @xmath35 and also normal to each other in direction of the extra coordinates @xmath42 .",

    "a simplifying assumption has been made to consider the brane hypersurface as extremely thin .",
    "let us now consider a thick brane of thickness @xmath15 . for simplicity we will restrict ourselves to the case of constant @xmath15 .",
    "one way to generate such thick brane is to deform the background spacetime @xmath73 in such a way that it remains compatible with confinement .",
    "the embedding functions defined in ( [ 1 - 5 ] ) are differentiable and regular as required by local differentiable embedding .",

    "the current value of the normal curvature radii of the flrw universe using ( [ 1-l ] ) will be @xmath231 which by inserting into ( [ 2 - 16 ] ) gives the current value of the density parameter of dark energy as @xmath232 the width of the brane @xmath15 , can be taken as a fundamental length related to the minimum size of the confined standard model interactions , where in the present cosmological settings , should be taken as localized baryonic matter ( nucleons ) . in the strong interactions physics , it is widely believed that coupling to the lowest mass mesons determines the localization size of hadrons to be @xmath233 in the manner first described by yokawa @xcite .",
    "further evidence in support of the idea that all hadrons , e.g. nucleons , couple strongly to low mass mesons is the fact that pions are the principal secondary component in high - energy collisions @xcite . also , as we know , the strong coupling of hadrons to light mesons is a general phenomena .",
    "these considerations , together with gell - mann s totalitarian principle lead bahcall and frantschi to the concept of `` hadron barrier '' : the minimum size of any system containing a nucleon can not then be appreciably less than the range of the strong interaction of pions with nucleons i.e. @xmath234 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the minimum measurable length over which matter fields can be localized on the brane is of the order of their compton wavelength of pion @xcite .",
    "also it is close to the radius of confinement , holding gluons and quarks inside hadrons @xcite .",
    "hence one may assume the width of the brane is of order of the compton wavelength of the pion @xmath235 , or in a better approximation , the overlap of the quark and antiquark wave - functions in the pion , called the decay constant @xmath236 @xcite ( all hadrons have a size @xmath237 ) .",
    "therefore we set @xmath238 and @xmath239 , the strong interaction pion - nucleon coupling `` constant '' @xcite .",
    "also , the best fit from the planck temperature data with planck lensing gives @xmath240 @xmath241 @xcite .",
    "hence the normal curvature radii at the present epoch will be @xmath242 in 1921 , kaluza suggested to unify the gravitational and electromagnetic interaction within the framework of a five multidimensional gravity theory .",
    "the fifth coordinate was made invisible through the cylinder condition : it was assumed that in the fifth direction , the world curled up into a cylinder of very small radius ( planck s length ) . in modern extension of kk ideas",
    ", the extra dimensions can be large and sometimes non - compact and the typical length of the extra dimensions will be of order @xmath243 @xcite . for @xmath244 ,",
    "the radius of internal space will be of order @xmath245 cm .",
    "this is approximately the diameter of the solar system , quite unsuitable as an internal dimension . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath246 , we obtain the sub - millimeter size for the internal space . according to ( [ m3 ] ) ,",
    "the normal radii ( a reasonable distance in the bulk space for gravity ) of brane in our model is of order of the hubble distance , like deffayet , dvali and gabadadze model @xcite .",
    "also the density parameter of dark energy becomes @xmath247 besides the bbn bound , namely @xmath248)-([2 - 12 ] ) help us to estimate @xmath249 .",
    "the energy density of dark energy at the present epoch will be @xmath250 let us point out that , nearly half a century ago , an interpretation of the cosmological constant through vacuum energy density was pioneered by zeldovich @xcite .",
    "he conjectured @xmath251 where @xmath252 is the cosmological constant and @xmath253 is close to the pion mass .",
    "note that , the zeldovich conjecture predicts a constant vacuum energy density , while equation ( [ an ] ) ( which is an amendment to his conjecture ) indicates a dark energy density which is not constant but changes with the expansion of the universe .    in the following table",
    ", we find the density parameter of dark energy , age of the universe and state parameter of dark energy for some specific number of extra dimensions .    table ( i ) +    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + as one can see in table ( i ) , the case of @xmath254 ( @xmath7 bulk space ) is particularly interesting .",
    "the contribution of baryonic and cold dark matters is nothing for @xmath255 , @xmath256 . on the other hand",
    ", observations do not agree with the theoretically obtained value of the age of universe and density parameter for @xmath257 . while for @xmath254 , not only the density fraction , age of the universe and the equation of state parameter are in good agreement with observations and results of the planck temperature data with planck lensing @xcite , but also they have the maximum possible values .",
    "the spacial case of @xmath7 ambient space not only is in agreement with observations but also has deeper geometrical meaning in our model .",
    "as was mentioned in the third item of introduction , one of our goals in this paper was to find a geometrical mechanism for unification of fundamental forces , using the group of isometries of the non - compact ambient space .",
    "as shown in @xcite , we need at least seven non - compact extra dimensions to realize the standard model group @xmath258 .",
    "the question of the true dimensionality of the world is surely one of the deepest questions that one can possibly ask in physics .",
    "strong motivation for considering space as multidimensional comes from theories which incorporate gravity in a reliable manner ;  string theory and m - theory .",
    "as we know , to facilitate the construction of supersymmetry and supergravity lagrangians , we need @xmath7 spacetime which is now recognized as the low energy effective description of @xmath7 m - theory @xcite . also to construct consistent superstring theories ,",
    "the requirement is a @xmath259 spacetime .",
    "m - theory is an @xmath7 extension of superstring theory , where proponents believe that the @xmath7 theory unifies all five @xmath259 string theories .",
    "the idea is the unique supersymmetric theory in @xmath7 , with its low - entropy matter content and interactions fully determined , and can be obtained as the strong coupling limit of type iia string theory because a new dimension of space emerges as the coupling constant increases @xcite . as we know , the various superstring theories are related by dualities which allow the description of an object in one string model to be related to the description of a different object in another one .",
    "these dualities imply that each of string theories is a different manifestation of a single underlying @xmath7 m - theory .",
    "all in all , one may conclude that perhaps the real `` home '' of string theory is not @xmath259 , but possibly @xmath7 m - theory which could be reduced down to @xmath7 supergravity as well as @xmath259 string theory .",
    "we have derived the covariant gravitational equations of a brane world model embedded isometrically in a bulk space with arbitrary number of dimensions .",
    "the extrinsic shape of the brane has a fundamental role in our approach .",
    "it makes a similarity between kk gravity and modern embedding program .",
    "also the induced @xmath6 gravitational constant depends on the extrinsic shape of our universe .",
    "the gravitational model thus obtained was then applied to cosmology . assuming the flrw spacetime embedded isometrically in a bulk space with arbitrary spacelike extra dimensions , we have re - derived the generalized friedmann equations .",
    "the obtained field equations contain the geometric fluid with its properties related to the extrinsic shape of the brane via the gravitational `` constant '' .",
    "hence , from point of view of a @xmath6 confined observer , ( which does not have access to the extra dimensions ) , the late time acceleration of the universe looks like as the effect of some phenomenological dark fluid .",
