    "in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron system subjected to a strong perpendicular magnetic field , which is called the quantum hall system , the half - filled states at each landau level ( ll ) exhibit much attractive features . around the half - filled lowest ll ,",
    "isotropic compressible states , which are widely believed to be the fermi liquid of composite fermions , have been observed.@xcite around the half - filled second ll , the @xmath2 fractionally quantized hall conductance has been observed .",
    "@xcite the p - wave cooper pairing state of composite fermions , which is called the pfaffian state , has been proposed to explain this state.@xcite around the half - filled third and higher lls , highly anisotropic states , which have extremely anisotropic longitudinal resistivities and un - quantized hall resistivities , have been found in ultra - high mobility samples at low temperature.@xcite many theoretical works have been done to study the anisotropic states .",
    "@xcite in the present paper , we focus on two different hartree - fock ( hf ) states , i.e. , a unidirectional charge density wave state,@xcite which is called a striped hall state in the present paper , and an anisotropic charge density wave ( acdw ) state.@xcite    the experimental features of the anisotropic states suggest that the anisotropic states are the striped hall states .",
    "the striped hall state has the anisotropic fermi surface , which has an energy gap in one direction and is gapless in the other direction . the anisotropic longitudinal resistivities and the un - quantized hall resistivities",
    "are naturally explained by this anisotropic fermi surface.@xcite on the other hand , the acdw state has energy gaps in both directions so that it is difficult to explain the experiments with the acdw state .",
    "however , the acdw state has a lower energy than the striped hall state in the system with no electric current .",
    "this has been a contradiction between the experiments and the theories for the anisotropic state .    in the experiments of the anisotropic states",
    ", current is injected .",
    "this current effect has not been taken into account in the previous calculations of the total energy .",
    "macdonald et al . have studied the injected current effect on the integer quantum hall system about two decades ago.@xcite they have calculated the current and charge distributions and found that charges accumulate around both edges of the sample with the opposite sign , as expected from the classical hall effect.@xcite the charge accumulation causes the energy enhancement via the coulomb interaction between charged particles .",
    "the same type of energy corrections may exist even in highly correlated quantum hall states .",
    "however , the effect of the injected current on the anisotropic state has not been studied .    in the present paper , we calculate the correlation energies of the striped hall state and the acdw state in the system with the injected current , no impurities , and no metallic contacts .",
    "it is important to know if the acdw state has a lower energy even in the system with the injected current . for this purpose ,",
    "the dependence of the correlation energies on the injected current is studied in detail .",
    "effects of impurities and metallic contacts are ignored in our calculations of the correlation energies since these effects are expected to be small in the experiments of the anisotropic states in the ultra - high mobility samples and are outside the scope of this work .",
    "the effects of the injected current are investigated using the response functions for electromagnetic fields .",
    "the current and charge distributions are determined and the energies of the two states are calculated from these distributions .",
    "it is found that the energy of the acdw state increases faster than that of the striped hall state as the injected current increases .",
    "hence , the striped hall state becomes the lower energy state when the current exceeds the critical value .",
    "the critical value is estimated at about @xmath0 - @xmath1 na , which is much smaller than the current used in the experiments .",
    "our result suggests that the anisotropic states observed in the experiments are the striped hall states .",
    "hence , the contradiction between the experiments and the theories is resolved .",
