    "random matrix theory ( rmt ) originated from dealing with the energy levels of complex many - body quantum systems has become an independent new statistics.@xmath10 different from the standard statistics in physics , rmt focuses its attention on the general properties of a number of stochastic ensembles with common symmetry .",
    "the correlation and fluctuation of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions in random hamiltonian systems are the central issues in the applications of rmt .",
    "apart from the nuclear and nuclei fields , it was also employed to study the critical statistics of disordered systems with various complex interaction.@xmath11 recently , resonant properties of composite materials have been studied extensively due to the large linear and nonlinear optical responses.@xmath12 in a dielectric network , there exist a lot of geometric resonances randomly distributing in the resonant area.@xmath13 for a specific sample , its resonance spectrum is very sensitive to the microstructure . while , for a large number of samples given a parameter , i.e. , concentration @xmath0 , the distribution of resonances is stable , which implies some general features of resonance spectrum .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the level spacing statistics of geometric resonances .    in this work ,",
    "a binary network is considered , where the impurity bonds with admittance @xmath14 are employed to replace the bonds in an otherwise homogeneous network of identical admittance @xmath15 .",
    "the admittance of each bond is generally complex and frequency - dependent .",
    "all the impurity bonds construct the clusters subspace . for a binary composite ,",
    "the admittance ratio @xmath16 of two components has a branch cut on the negative axis when resonance happens.@xmath17 based on the greens - function formalism ( gff ) , the eigenvalues(@xmath18 and @xmath19 $ ] ) of greens - matrix @xmath20 are solved , the sequence of which forms the resonance spectrum.@xmath21 @xmath20 maps the geometric configuration of the clusters subspace .",
    "its solutions summarize the geometric resonances of the network subject to the external sources and in the quasistatic limit .",
    "the element of @xmath20 is defined as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 means that the jointing points @xmath24 and @xmath25 belong to the impurity metallic cluster and are the nearest neighbors .",
    "more clearly , @xmath26 describes the interaction between @xmath27 and @xmath28 and is closely related to the `` environment '' or the nearest neighbors of @xmath28 . in a dilute network , there exists a large `` environment '' difference between two jointing points , hence the elements of @xmath20 distribute more uncorrelatively rather than with some symmetry .",
    "however , for a percolating network , due to the self - similar structure , @xmath27 and @xmath28 have the similar `` environment '' and @xmath29 is approximately equal to @xmath30 .",
    "it is analogous to the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) , in which the elements of the hamiltonian matrix must satisfy @xmath31 .",
    "so , for a disordered composite , it is expected that the correlation and fluctuation of eigenvalues of @xmath20 have the general features .    in the following",
    ", statistics of resonance level spacing in the disordered binary composites is studied intensively on the unfolded scale . for one sample , there are more than @xmath32 levels numerically solved by its greens - matrix @xmath20 . in the unfolding procedure ,",
    "we use a fit of the third order polynomial to the data . for an arbitrary @xmath0 , @xmath33 samples , with totally more than @xmath34 levels , are computed for the sake of the ensemble averaging . for a definite @xmath0 within the interval",
    "@xmath1 $ ] , our numerical calculations indicate that the unfolded level spacing distribution @xmath2 and level number variance @xmath35 have the general features .",
    "it is also shown that the short - range fluctuation @xmath2 and long - range spectral correlation @xmath35 lie between the profiles of the poisson ensemble and goe .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next two sections , for various @xmath0 , level spacing distributions @xmath2 s and level number variances @xmath36",
    "s are calculated on the unfolded scale .",
    "then , in section iv , at @xmath37 , crossover behavior of @xmath2 and @xmath35 is obtained , giving the finite size scaling of mean level spacing @xmath38 and mean level number @xmath7 .",
    "finally , we summarize the main results in section v.",
    "in order to remove the system - specific mean level density or normalize the resonance level spacing of different samples , unfolding procedure is necessary . for a sample , the cumulative spectral function @xmath39 of its resonance spectrum",
    "is defined as@xmath40 @xmath41where @xmath42 is the spectral function of levels . when @xmath43 , @xmath44 should be smooth",
    "@xmath39 is the staircase function and is used to count the number of levels . to satisfy",
    "that @xmath44 is smooth , @xmath45 is rescaled by @xmath46 as @xmath47where @xmath46 is the smooth part of @xmath39 and @xmath48 is the fluctuating part of @xmath39 .",
    "1 shows the small section of the measured spectrum . in the following ,",
    "we use the third order polynomial to fit the data . however , when @xmath49 or @xmath50 , the ninth or eleventh polynomial is not high enough to fit the curve because of the large fluctuation of level spacing .",
    "so at the dilute systems , numerical calculations are not accurate .    the level spacing distribution @xmath2 is the probability density for neighboring levels @xmath51 and @xmath52 having the spacing @xmath53 .",
    "it is used to describe the short - range spectral fluctuations . on the unfolded scale ,",
    "the function @xmath2 and its first moment are normalized to unity , @xmath54 and @xmath55 . for the uncorrelated or poisson ensemble @xmath56 , while for the goe , or wigner - dyson ensemble , @xmath57 .",
    "2 displays the level spacing distributions @xmath2 s for various @xmath0 within the interval @xmath58 $ ] . in this figure ,",
    "the distributions @xmath59 and @xmath60 are drawn by the dashed and solid lines respectively .",
    "the solid curves with the filled or opaque circles represent the critical distributions @xmath61 at the percolation threshold @xmath62 .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "2 is used to describe the level spacing distributions @xmath2 s when @xmath63 . in this case , the calculations of the functions @xmath2 s are not very accurate because of the degeneracy of resonances . for a specific sample ,",
    "it is impossible to estimate where the next level is due to the complex microstructure .",
    "however , for the disordered composites with a definite @xmath0 , when the @xmath64th level is measured , the spacing between the @xmath64th and @xmath65th levels satisfies the ensemble averaged distribution @xmath2 , rather than the poisson distribution @xmath59 or goe case @xmath60 .",
    "it is seen that the distributions @xmath2 s lie between the profiles of the poisson ensemble and goe for @xmath66 $ ] . as discussed in the introductory part , the critical @xmath61 approaches the @xmath60 due to the strong interaction among the metallic bonds . when @xmath0 is very small , @xmath67 is close to @xmath59 due to the weak interaction . at last , for an arbitrary @xmath0",
    ", @xmath2 lies between the functions @xmath59 and @xmath61 . in this figure",
    ", it is also shown the crossover behavior of @xmath2 .    in fig .",
    "2 , we find that the probability of small spacing is much less than the uncorrelated poisson distribution .",
    "it means that some repulsion exists between neighboring levels .",
    "the repulsion in gaussion ensembles comes from the symmetry of matrix elements . here",
    ", the property of matrix elements is described by the greens - matrix @xmath20 of the gff .",
    "so the repulsion of resonance levels is caused by the interaction of metallic bonds .",
    "the repulsion becomes stronger with decreasing @xmath68 .",
    "for the goe , we notice the importance of the repulsion law @xmath69 with @xmath70 for small spacing.@xmath40 while for the composite materials with various @xmath0 , when @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "when @xmath73 , here @xmath74 is the second intersection point of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , the long tails of all functions approach the values of the poisson ensemble .",
    "the above nearest neighbor level spacing distribution contains the information of short scales about the resonance spectrum .",
    "long - range correlation is measured by the level number variance @xmath35 , given by@xmath40    @xmath75    where @xmath76 counts the number of levels in the interval @xmath77 $ ] on the unfolded scale .",
    "the angular bracket denotes the average over the starting points @xmath78 . by the unfolding , @xmath79 should be equal to @xmath80 .",
    "thus , in the interval of length @xmath80 , one expects to find the @xmath81 levels on average . for the poisson spectrum without correlation , one obtains @xmath82 , while for the goe , the analytical result is @xmath83where @xmath84 is the euler s constant .",
    "3 shows the numerical results of level number variances @xmath35 s for @xmath85 $ ] .",
    "the same lines and symbols are used as those in fig .",
    "2 , namely , the profiles of the poisson ensemble and goe are represented by the dashed and solid lines , and the critical level number variance @xmath86 is plotted by the solid line with the circles .",
    "it is obvious that the correlation among levels is greater than the poisson case and less than the goe case .",
    "we could not collect the data for @xmath87 due to the degeneracy of eigenvalues . when @xmath49 or @xmath88 , the level number variance @xmath35 is out of the boundary of the poisson ensemble .",
    "the reason is that the data can not be fitted very well by the third or higher order polynomial in the unfolding procedure . for @xmath89",
    "$ ] , @xmath35 s lie between the profiles @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "3 , the curves almost overlap for @xmath92 and @xmath93 , as well as for @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "so at the percolation threshold , the crossover behavior of the level number variance is numerically obtained .",
    "for a percolating network , level spacing distribution limited in the interval @xmath96 $ ] has been investigated by luck et .",
    "al .. @xmath97 recent numerical calculations indicate that the resonances within @xmath98 $ ] and @xmath99 $ ] are important because the high values of the inverse participation ratios ( ipr ) in those regions correspond to the strongly enhanced optical responses.@xmath100 in order to study the criticality of level spacing distribution @xmath2 and level number variance @xmath101 in a two dimensional network , the duality of level spacing for binary model is discussed .",
    "we consider an infinite binary network with concentration @xmath0 .",
    "the admittance of impurity bonds and matrix bonds is set to @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "we get the admittance ratio @xmath102 and @xmath18 .",
    "the resonance spectrum is given by the set @xmath103 .",
    "then the set @xmath104 of level spacing can be written as @xmath105 with @xmath106 . for a large network ,",
    "@xmath107 is a typical configuration of the concentration @xmath0 .",
    "binary model is invariant under the simultaneous interchange @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "so @xmath110 is also a typical configuration of the concentration @xmath111 and we get the new admittance ratio @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "the spectrum of resonance is replaced by the set @xmath114 with @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "the new level spacing set @xmath117 is just the original set @xmath118 .",
    "so the duality of level spacing exists for the binary model and it is the self - dual at @xmath119 .",
    "the functions @xmath2 and @xmath35 are computed based on the same set @xmath118 for @xmath0 and @xmath111 .    in the calculations",
    ", we can not find the strict duality of level spacing .",
    "one reason is that the binary sample is not large enough .",
    "another is that the degeneracy of resonances affects the accuracy of @xmath2 and @xmath36 when @xmath120 .",
    "numerical results indicate the crossover of level spacing distribution @xmath2 and level number variance @xmath35 , as shown in fig . 4 and fig . 5 .",
    "to characterize this behavior , for each distribution @xmath2 , we compute the value @xmath121dt}{% \\int_{0}{}^{t_{0}}[p_{p}(t)-p_{wd}(t)]dt}$ ] with @xmath122 , the first interaction point of @xmath59 and @xmath60.@xmath123 in this way , @xmath124 varies from @xmath125 $ ] to @xmath126 $ ] .",
    "we note that @xmath127 at the transition is close to the value @xmath128 , which corresponds to @xmath129 at the anderson transition.@xmath130 as observed in fig . 4 , @xmath131 is closer to the value @xmath132 of the poisson ensemble with increasing @xmath68 . in fig .",
    "3 , we have found the linear relation of @xmath35 with respect to @xmath80 as @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is called the spectral compressibility.@xmath135 when the unfolded number @xmath80 is larger , the value @xmath134 is @xmath132 for the poisson ensemble , while for the goe or wigner - dyson ensemble , @xmath134 is approximately equal to @xmath136 . for various @xmath0 , the slopes @xmath134 s are plotted in fig .",
