    "one of major open problems on colorings of planar graphs is steinberg s conjecture from 1976 .",
    "the conjecture asserts that every planar graph with no cycles of length four or five is 3-colorable .",
    "this problem has been attracting a substantial amount of attention among graph theorists , see  ( * ? ? ? * section 7 ) .",
    "it is also one of the six graph theory problems ranked with the 4-star ( highest ) importance in the open problem garden  @xcite . as a possible approach towards proving the conjecture , erds in 1991 ( see  @xcite ) suggested to determine the smallest @xmath0 such that every planar graph with no cycles of length @xmath1 is @xmath2-colorable .",
    "borodin et al .",
    "@xcite , improving up on  @xcite , showed that @xmath3 , i.e. , every planar graph with no cycles of length four , five , six or seven is 3-colorable .",
    "many other relaxations of the conjecture have been established , e.g.  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the conjecture is known to be false in the list coloring setting  @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader for further results on the conjecture and other problems related to colorings of planar graphs to  @xcite .",
    "we disprove steinberg s conjecture by constructing a planar graph with no cycles of length four or five that is not 3-colorable .",
    "this also disproves strong bordeaux conjecture from  @xcite and novosibirsk 3-color conjecture from  @xcite .",
    "every planar graph with no pair of cycles of length three sharing an edge and with no cycle of length five is 3-colorable .",
    "every planar graph without a cycle of length three sharing an edge with a cycle of length three or five is 3-colorable .",
    "we would like to remark that we have not tried to minimize the number of vertices in our construction ; we are actually aware of the existence of smaller counterexamples ( the smallest one with 85 vertices ) but we decided to present the one that is the simplest to analyze among those that we have found .",
    "our construction has three steps . in each of these steps ,",
    "we construct a particular planar graph with no cycles of length four or five that has some additional properties .",
    "the next two lemmas present the first two steps of the construction .",
    "[ lm - step1 ] the graph @xmath4 that is depicted in figure  [ fig - step1 ] has no cycles of length four or five and there is no @xmath2-coloring that would assign the same color to all the three vertices @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , the distance between @xmath5 and @xmath6 is three , between @xmath5 and @xmath7 is three , and between @xmath6 and @xmath7 is four .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath4 contains no cycle of length four or five , the distance between @xmath5 and @xmath6 is three , between @xmath5 and @xmath7 is three , and between @xmath6 and @xmath7 is four .",
    "suppose that @xmath4 has a @xmath2-coloring such that all the three vertices @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 have the same color , say @xmath8 .",
    "the other two colors must be used in an alternating way to color the vertices @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "this implies that the vertices @xmath15 , @xmath0 and @xmath16 have the color @xmath8 .",
    "hence , the two colors different from @xmath8 must be used to color the vertices @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which is impossible since these three vertices form a triangle .",
    "[ lm - step2 ] the graph @xmath20 that is depicted in figure  [ fig - step2 ] has no cycles of length four or five and there is no @xmath2-coloring that would assign the same color to all the three vertices @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , the distance between any pairs of the vertices @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 is four .",
    "note that the graph @xmath20 consists of three copies of the graph @xmath4 pasted together as depicted in figure  [ fig - step2 ] .",
    "we start by checking that the distance between the vertices @xmath5 and @xmath6 is four ( the cases of the other two pairs are symmetric ) .",
    "since @xmath5 and @xmath6 are joined by a path of length four , their distance is at most four .",
    "lemma  [ lm - step1 ] implies that there is no path of length less than four inside the copy of @xmath4 containing @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "on the other hand , any path passing through more than one copy of @xmath4 must have length at least three inside each traversed copy of @xmath4 , so its total length can not be less than six .",
    "we conclude that the distance between @xmath5 and @xmath6 is four .",
    "we next check that @xmath20 has no cycle of length four or five . by lemma  [ lm - step1 ] ,",
    "no cycle inside one of the copies of @xmath4 has length four or five .",
    "since the distance between any two of the contact vertices of the copies of @xmath4 ( the vertices used to glue the copies together ) is at least three by lemma  [ lm - step1 ] , the length of any cycle passing through two or three of the copies is at least six .",
    "the only cycle that does not contain an edge inside a copy of @xmath4 is the cycle @xmath21 and its length is three .",
    "therefore , @xmath20 has no cycle of length four or five .    it remains to check that @xmath20 has no @xmath2-coloring such that the vertices @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 get the same color .",
    "suppose that @xmath20 has a @xmath2-coloring such that the vertices @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 receive the same color , say @xmath8 .",
    "by lemma  [ lm - step1 ] , the color of any of the vertices @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 is different from @xmath8 .",
    "however , this is impossible since the vertices @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 form a triangle and there are only three colors in total .",
    "hence , @xmath20 has no @xmath2-coloring such that the vertices @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 would get the same color .",
    "we are now ready to provide the counterexample construction .",
    "[ thm - main ] there exists a planar graph with no cycles of length four or five that is not @xmath2-colorable .",
    "consider the graph @xmath22 obtained by taking four copies of the graph @xmath20 from lemma  [ lm - step2 ] and pasting them together with additional vertices @xmath6 , @xmath10 and @xmath23 in the way depicted in figure  [ fig - main ] .",
    "we first argue that @xmath22 has no cycle of length four or five . by lemma  [ lm - step2 ]",
    ", there is no cycle of length four or five inside a single copy of @xmath20 .",
    "any cycle containing an edge inside a copy of @xmath20 that is not fully contained inside the copy must contain at least four edges inside the considered copy of @xmath20 , since the distance between any two of the contact vertices of @xmath20 is four by lemma  [ lm - step2 ] . since such a cycle must contain at least two edges outside the copy of @xmath20 , its length must be at least six .",
    "hence , there is no cycle with length four or five that contains an edge inside a copy of @xmath20 .",
    "observe that there are exactly three cycles not containing an edge inside any copy of @xmath20 and these are triangles @xmath24 , @xmath21 and @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , @xmath22 has no cycle of length four or five .",
    "suppose that @xmath22 has a @xmath2-coloring and let @xmath8 be the color assigned to the vertex @xmath5 .",
    "since the vertices of the triangle @xmath24 must be assigned all three colors and the color of @xmath6 is not @xmath8 , either @xmath7 or @xmath26 is colored with @xmath8 . by symmetry",
    ", we can assume that the color of @xmath7 is @xmath8 . since the vertices @xmath5 , @xmath7 and @xmath9 are contact vertices of a copy of @xmath20 , the color of @xmath9 is not @xmath8 by lemma  [ lm - step2 ] .",
    "similarly , since the vertices @xmath5 , @xmath7 and @xmath11 are contact vertices of a copy of @xmath20 , the color of @xmath11 is also not @xmath8 .",
    "hence , none of the vertices @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( note the vertex @xmath10 is adjacent to @xmath5 ) has the color @xmath8 , which is impossible since the vertices @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 form a triangle .",
    "we conclude that the graph @xmath22 has no @xmath2-coloring .",
