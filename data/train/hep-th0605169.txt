    "the classical trajectory which connects one top with the another contains only one instanton for any finite @xmath14 . if we consider the trajectories with energy lower than the maximum of the potential then there are possible solutions with @xmath70 instanton , but the solution is periodic and , hence , the time intervals between all of them are the same .    let us show how it can be clarified that for large @xmath14 the main contribution is indeed given by the trajectories where particle stays an arbitrary time of the top of the potential .",
    "when @xmath144 in ( [ formula_k ] ) , the main contribution is given by the trajectories with the turning points @xmath178 . as it was already mentioned above , every such turn is given actually by the sum over arbitrary combinations of the reflections in the small vicinity of the root .",

    ". simply speaking , geometric series shifting the pole in the energy representation turns to exponential series in the time representation .",
    "note that one of the main features of the laplace transform is that the contraction w.r.t .",
    "time turns to the multiplication .",
    "thus the functional integral as a sum of different sequences of events during the fixed time turns to the sum of sequences of independent events , i.e. so that particle at each point of its path  does not remember  the prehistory , and the weights corresponding to the paths in sum have multiplicative structure ( up to factors at the ends ) : @xmath184}e^{i{s{[p_1\\sqcup p_2]}}}=a{[p_1]}e^{i{s{[p_1]}}}\\cdot a{[p_2]}e^{is{[p_2]}}$ ] .",
