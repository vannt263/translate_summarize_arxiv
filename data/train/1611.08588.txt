    "convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have made impressive improvements in object detection for several years .",
    "thanks to many innovative works , recent object detection algorithms have reached accuracies acceptable for commercialization in a broad range of markets like automotive and surveillance . however , in terms of detection speed , even the best algorithms are still suffering from heavy computational cost .",
    "although recent reports on network compression and quantization shows promising results , it is still important to reduce the computational cost in the network design stage .    the successes in network compression @xcite and decomposition of convolution kernels @xcite",
    "imply that present network architectures are highly redundant .",
    "therefore , reducing these redundancies is a straightforward approach in reducing the computational cost .",
    "this paper presents a lightweight network architecture for object detection , named pvanet , which achieves state - of - the - art detection accuracy in real - time .",
    "based on the basic principle of `` smaller number of output channels with more layers '' , we adopt c.relu@xcite in the initial layers and inception structure@xcite in the latter part of the network .",
    "multi - scale feature concatenation@xcite is also applied to maximize the multi - scale nature of object detection tasks .",
    "we also show that our thin but deep network can be trained effectively with batch normalization @xcite , residual connections @xcite , and our own learning rate scheduling based on plateau detection .",
    "this paper presents our lightweight but effective network architecture for object detection , named pvanet , which achieves the state - of - the - art detection accuracy and can run in real - time :    * computational cost : only 0.61 gmac for feature extraction from a 224x224 input .",
    "alexnet @xcite requires 0.67 gmac ) * runtime performance : 750ms / image ( 1.3fps ) on intel i7 - 6700k cpu with a single core ; 46ms / image ( 21.7fps ) on nvidia titan x gpu * accuracy : 84.9% map on voc-2007 ; 83.7% map on voc-2012    we design the network with `` less number of output channels '' to minimize redundancies in intermediate outputs .",
    "we nonetheless stack more layers into a deeper network so that the network does nt lose its capability . additionally , we combine some recent building blocks while some of them have not been verified their effectiveness on object detection tasks :    * we adopt concatenated rectified linear unit ( c.relu ) @xcite in our network design to reduce its computational costs without losing accuracy .",
    "moreover , we propose our own variant of c.relu which shows better accuracy than the original work . *",
    "the design of our network is influenced by inception structure@xcite .",
    "we have observed that stacking up inception modules can capture widely varying - sized objects more effectively than a linear chain of convolutions .",
    "* we adopt the idea of multi - scale representation like hypernet @xcite that combines several intermediate outputs so that multiple levels of details and non - linearities can be considered simultaneously .",
    "we also show that our thin but deep network can be trained effectively with batch normalization @xcite , residual connections @xcite , and our own learning rate scheduling based on plateau detection .    in the remaining sections ,",
    "we describe the structure of pvanet as a feature extraction network ( section [ subsec : feature_extraction ] ) and a detection network ( section [ subsec : frcnn ] ) .",
    "then , we present experimental results on imagenet 2012 classification , voc-2007 and voc-2012 benchmarks with detailed training and testing methodologies ( section [ sec : experiments ] ) .",

    "in this paper , we show that the current networks are highly redundant and that we can design a thin and light network which is capable of complex vision tasks .",
    "elaborate adoptions and combinations of recent technical innovations on deep learning make it possible for us to design a network to maximize the computational efficiency . even though the proposed network is designed for object detection , we believe that our design principle is widely applicable to other tasks such as face recognition and semantic analysis .",
    "our network design is completely independent of network compression and quantization .",
    "all kinds of recent compression and quantization techniques are applicable to our network as well to further increase the actual performance in real applications . as an example",
    ", we show that a simple technique like truncated svd could achieve a notable improvement in the runtime performance based on our network ."
