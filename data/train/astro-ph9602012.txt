    "the long - standing discrepancy between the observed and the predicted neutrino fluxes has motivated the study of many non - standard solar models , which are in most cases _ ad hoc _ perturbations of the standard solar model . for many of the proposed changes of ssm input parameters ( e.g. nuclear cross sections , element abundances , and opacities ) , the predicted neutrino fluxes are approximately characterized by a single derived model parameter , the central temperature , @xmath5 . for small variations of input parameters , the neutrino fluxes and the central temperature of a detailed solar model",

    "the most initially suprising result of the stellar evolution calculations is that the magnitude of the @xmath1 neutrino flux dependence depends inversely upon the value of the central temperature .",
    "we shall see that even this result has a simple , quantitative explanation in terms of the nuclear physics of the energy generation process .",
    "the scaling with the central solar temperature can be used to evaluate neutrino fluxes for small deviations from the standard solar model .",
    "if a model is known to have a slightly different central temperature than the ssm , the neutrino fluxes can be estimated without detailed numerical calculations .",
    "many classes of non - standard models ( involving , e.g. , rapid rotation in the solar interior , some variations in nuclear cross sections , or the existence of a strong magnetic field in the solar core ) , reduce the central temperature .",
    "a quantitative determination of the reduction in the central temperature implied by a specified change in the input physics requires detailed numerical modeling . with the aid of the temperature scaling laws , neutrino fluxes from non - standard solar models",

    "the often - quoted dependence of the @xmath1 neutrino flux on a negative power of the temperature ( @xmath70 ) results from the fact that as the central temperature gets larger , an increasing number of the completions of the @xmath1 chain proceed through the @xmath44 reaction ( reaction 5 of table  [ ppreaction ] ) .",
    "a complete fusion reaction of four protons being converted to an alpha particle via the @xmath44 reaction involves the production of only one @xmath1 neutrino ( cf .",
    "table  [ ppreaction ] ) . on the other hand , a fusion of four protons via the @xmath71 reaction ( reaction 4 of table  [ ppreaction ] ) produces two @xmath1 neutrinos .",
    "the @xmath71 reaction predominates at lower temperatures . thus the @xmath1 flux is larger at lower central temperatures .",
    "the dependences of the other neutrino fluxes upon the central solar temperature can all be derived as simple power laws , @xmath72 .",
    "the power law exponent , @xmath56 , can be obtained from the one - zone model .",
    "the flux of @xmath2be neutrinos can be calculated from the rate equation @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the rate at which @xmath2be captures electrons in the solar interior ( reaction 6 of table  [ ppreaction ] ) . here",
    "@xmath75 is , as before , the reaction cross section times velocity averaged over a maxwell - boltzman temperature distribution .",
    "the @xmath2be electron - capture reaction is much faster@xcite under solar interior conditions than the competing proton - capture reaction ( reaction 8 of table  [ ppreaction ] ) .",
    "the electron - capture rate is , in equilibrium , essentially equal to the rate of production of @xmath2be .",

    "( [ np2 ] ) for the @xmath1 reaction .",
    "thus @xmath77 which is approximately 10% larger than the value of @xmath11 that is obtained from the detailed numerical models ( see table  [ tableexp ] ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of the @xmath34b neutrino flux can be calculated in a similar manner .",
    "the @xmath34b neutrino flux results from a rare branch of the @xmath1 chain ( reaction 8 of table  [ ppreaction ] ) in which @xmath2be captures a proton rather than an electron .",

    "( [ b8rate ] ) , we find : @xmath80 the temperature dependence is much stronger for @xmath34b neutrinos than for @xmath2be neutrinos because the electron capture rate depends only weakly on temperature ( essentially like @xmath81@xcite ) , and the proton capture rate increases rapidly with temperature ( like all strong interaction fusion rates ) .",
    "the derived scaling exponent for @xmath34b , @xmath82 , is fortuitously close to the value of @xmath83 that is obtained by fitting to the detailed numerical models ( cf .",

    "the temperature dependence of the cno neutrino fluxes can also be estimated simply .",
    "for the major part of the cno cycle which leads from @xmath86c to @xmath15n , the slowest reaction is @xmath87@xcite .",

    "violations of the sum rule in the one - zone model are caused primarily by the fact that different neutrino fluxes are produced in different temperature regions of the sun .",
    "if high precision is required , the solar neutrino fluxes can not be parameterized by a single temperature .",
    "in the previous sections , we have concentrated ( as have most other investigations of this subject ) on the average dependence of individual neutrino fluxes on the central solar temperature . in this section , we focus on the correlations that occur between the deviations of different neutrino fluxes from their average values .",
    "previously we asked : on average , how strongly does a particular neutrino flux depend upon temperature ? in this section , we ask : if one neutrino flux is larger than its average value by a specified amount , is a second neutrino flux larger or smaller than its average and , if so , by how much ?",

    "@xmath109    where @xmath110 is the standard value of the @xmath41th neutrino flux computed for the best input parameters and input physics .",

    "the difference between the slope obtained with the monte carlo study and the slope found with the one - zone model reflects the same imprecision in the one - zone model that was found earlier in section  [ subsec : pptscaling ] and section  [ subsec : be7b8tscaling ] .",
    "the slope that is relevant for figure  [ correlationbe7pp ] is the ratio of the @xmath2be and @xmath1 temperature exponents for neutrino fluxes ; these exponents are predicted by the one - zone model to be ( see table  [ tableexp ] ) , respectively , 10% too large and 20% too small relative to the detailed models .",

    "therefore , the predicted one - zone model slope , @xmath115 , for @xmath34b versus @xmath2be is @xmath120,which is very close to the value of @xmath121 found in the monte carlo study .",
    "the one - zone model predicts a somewhat too steep dependence of fractional changes in @xmath34b neutrino fluxes versus fractional changes in @xmath2be neutrino fluxes , namely , @xmath122 , versus @xmath123 .",

    "this lack of tightness in the relations shown in figure  [ correlationb8be7pp ] results ultimately from the fact that , in all modern solar models , the @xmath34b - producing reaction , reaction  8 table  [ ppreaction ] , is rare and does not influence significantly the structure of the sun .",
    "in fact , the largest uncertainty in the model calculations of the @xmath34b neutrino flux is caused by the uncertainty in the experimental value for the low - energy nuclear cross section of reaction  8 ; the value of this cross section has essentially no effect ( @xmath124 ) on the calculated rates of the other nuclear fusion reactions .",
    "the most interesting result of our study is the understanding it provides of the negative temperature dependence of the @xmath1 neutrino flux .",
    "the empirical fact that the @xmath1 flux decreases with increasing central temperature , contrary to the trend found with all other solar neutrino fluxes , has been known since 1988@xcite , but has not previously been explained physically . at first glance , this negative temperature dependence is counter - intuitive .",
    "in section  [ subsec : pptscaling ] , we show that the negative temperature dependence is a simple consequence of the fact that at higher temperatures only one @xmath1 neutrino is produced per ( approximately ) @xmath125 mev communicated to the star(via fusion of four protons ) , whereas at lower temperatures two @xmath1 neutrinos are produced per @xmath125 mev .",
    "in other words , at lower temperatures the @xmath36he-@xmath36he fusion termination reaction(which requires two @xmath1 reactions ) predominates whereas at higher temperatures the @xmath36he-@xmath126he reaction is faster ( and requires only one @xmath1 reaction ) .",
    "the total energy per unit time communicated to the star must equal the observed solar luminosity , independent of the assumed central temperature .",
    "thus , as the temperature increases and more of the nuclear fusion is accomplished by the @xmath36he-@xmath126he reaction , fewer @xmath1 neutrinos are produced ( and more @xmath2be and @xmath34b neutrinos are created ) .    in order to obtain a simple physical understanding of the temperature scalings and the correlations between the different neutrino fluxes ,",
    "we have adopted a one - zone model for the interior of the sun .",
    "this model is characterized by a fixed central temperature , @xmath22 , and a total luminosity that is equal to the observed solar luminosity . given the emphasis in the current literature on calculating ever more precise solar models , with hundreds of different mass shells , it is gratifying and surprising that the one - zone model accounts semi - quantitatively for some of the most often used results of the detailed model calculations .",
    "moreover , the one - zone model predicts the average correlations found between the different neutrino fluxes , a bonus in insight that was not possible to anticipate without detailed study of the simple model .",

    "we have used these data to determine average temperature exponents , @xmath56 , for all of the solar neutrino fluxes , where by assumption @xmath127 .",
    "the exponents determined here are obtained by a formal best - fitting technique and are to be preferred to the previously - estimated exponents@xcite inferred less formally from these same data ; the previously - estimated exponents have been widely used in the literature .",
    "we have also estimated , for the first time so far as we know , uncertainties in the inferred temperature exponents .",
    "figure  [ correlationbe7pp ] and figure  [ correlationb8be7pp ] show the correlations , found in the monte carlo study , between the different individual neutrino fluxes .",
    "these correlations reflect the fact that when one neutrino flux is increased or decreased , there is likely to be a corresponding change in the values of the other neutrino fluxes .",
    "these correlations must be taken into account when comparing the results of theoretical solar model calculations , including their uncertainties , with solar neutrino experiments .",
    "the only precise way to include the correlations displayed in figure  [ correlationbe7pp ] and figure  [ correlationb8be7pp ] is to use the complete set of calculated neutrino fluxes in the theoretical analysis(cf .",
    "@xcite ) . various practical approximations to this rather cumbersome method have been discussed in the literature ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the temperature exponents calculated with the aid of the one - zone model agree with the exponents inferred from the monte carlo study of precise solar models to an accuracy of 20% or better for the three most important solar neutrino fluxes : @xmath1 , @xmath2be , and @xmath34b .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ tableexp ] , which compares the exponents calculated with the one - zone model with the results obtained from the detailed solar models .",
    "figure  [ scalingvstemp ] shows that the scaling exponents calculated in the one - zone solar model are not strongly dependent upon the assumed characteristic central temperature , @xmath22 ( taken here to be @xmath128k ) .",
    "the quantitative agreement between the results of the one - zone model and the detailed models is impressive given the fact that the temperature exponents vary from @xmath129 for @xmath1 neutrinos to @xmath130 for @xmath34b neutrinos .",
    "the physical insight provided by the one - zone model suggests a new form for the temperature dependence of the @xmath1 neutrino flux , which is given in eq .",
    "( [ preferred ] ) . in this form ,",
    "the variation of the @xmath1 neutrino flux is , for all temperatures , consistent with the observed solar luminosity , since it was derived by considering the relation between the solar luminosity , eq .",
    "( 2 ) , and the @xmath1 neutrino flux , eq . ( 3 ) .",
    "moreover , the formula for the @xmath1 neutrino flux , eq .",
    "( [ ppfluxlum ] ) , provided by the one - zone model makes explicit the close correlation between the @xmath2be and @xmath1 neutrino fluxes that is manifest in figure  [ correlationbe7pp ] .",
    "the expression used in this paper for the @xmath1 neutrino flux , eq .",
    "( [ preferred ] ) , was derived by considering the relation between the solar luminosity , eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) , and the @xmath1 rate , eq .",
    "( [ ppnucrate ] ) .",
    "physically , the strong correlation exists because the @xmath2be neutrino flux is proportional to the rate of reaction 5 of table  [ ppreaction ] and the @xmath1 neutrino flux is proportional to a constant minus the rate of reaction 5 ( if we neglect the small contribution from cno neutrinos ) .",
    "the one - zone model also accounts quantitatively for the average correlation , shown in figure  [ correlationb8be7pp ] , between the @xmath34b and @xmath2be neutrino fluxes , and between the @xmath34b and @xmath1 neutrino fluxes .",
    "no simple model can , however , account in detail for the scatter in the correlation plots shown in figure  [ correlationbe7pp ] and figure  [ correlationb8be7pp ] .",
    "the monte carlo experiments simulate uncertainties in many different parameters ; the power - law fits in the figures represent only the average response of the neutrino fluxes to the changes in all the individual parameters . for analyses requiring a precise assessment of the correlations between the different neutrino fluxes , a monte carlo study of detailed solar models",
    "is required .",
    "what have we learned from this study ?",
    "improved temperature exponents for the neutrino fluxes are now available , with estimates for the uncertainties in the exponents .",
    "a static one - zone model of the sun accounts for the essential features of the temperature scaling of the neutrino fluxes and even describes well the average correlations between the fluxes .",
    "the model does not provide a precise description of the temperature dependences nor of the correlations between the different fluxes .",
    "the exponents derived from the one - zone mode model do not satify precisely the sum rule derived from the measured solar luminosity .",
    "the fundamental reason that the one - zone model does not account accuractely for all of the known results is that in precise solar models each neutrino flux is produced in a different range of temperatures .",
    "one can not represent the results of different temperature ranges by a single parameter , @xmath22 .    in the future , a new monte carlo study must be undertaken to determine the temperature scalings and the correlations between the neutrino fluxes when , as required by helioseismological measurements@xcite , diffusion is taken into account in the solar model calculations .",
    "the analysis of bludman@xcite suggests that the effects of diffusion may alter the inferred temperature exponents by a non - negligible amount when compared to the values given in this paper , which are obtained from detailed solar models that do not include diffusion@xcite .",
    "a monte carlo study is now underway that will create 1000 solar models that include diffusion and other recent refinements of the stellar model@xcite .",
