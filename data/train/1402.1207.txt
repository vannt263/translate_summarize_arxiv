    "there have been tremendous advances in the performance of atomic frequency standards ( clocks ) over the past 40 years , and , for compelling reasons , there are growing efforts to put more advanced atomic clocks into space .",
    "prominent examples are the pharao cold - cesium atomic clock that is part of the european aces mission@xcite scheduled to fly on the international space station about 2016 , the compact hg@xmath0 ion standard of jpl designed for space applications , and other promising systems under development for the future ( the esa space optical clock,@xcite the darpa slow beam optical clock@xcite ) .",
    "advanced laser systems have already vastly improved the performance of atomic clocks and optical frequency synthesis and division .",
    "lasers can do the same for time transfer to space .",
    "the basic system concept is to take advantage of the very high stability and high accuracy available from cold - atom atomic clocks , as well as the precise timing and optical frequency division provided by femotosecond lasers , and then leverage instrumentation and technologies developed for other applications in space to achieve a robust high precision time transfer system .",
    "the other technologies required include : laser communication ( lasercom ) links between ground and space,@xcite ultrafast electronics and photodetectors , and robust fiber - optic telecom technologies .",
    "lasercom links to the satellite can transport the high performance atomic time from state - of - the - art ground clocks to the satellite .",
    "integrating these systems and technologies would allow us to create a very high performance inertial space - time reference ( str ) satellite with unprecedented performance , that would serve as a stable and accurate reference for coordinate position and time .",
    "a block diagram of the major system components is shown in fig .  [ opticallink ] .    the precise time and",
    "frequency reference on the ground comes from a high performance atomic frequency standard ( `` clock '' ) as found at a national standards laboratory .",
    "a stable cw laser ( or microwave source ) is locked to the narrow atomic transition ; the stable cw laser , in turn , stabilizes the self - referenced fs - optical frequency comb .",
    "the stabilized fs - optical comb is a train of optical pulses that are phase - coherent with the optical comb and the stable cw laser .",
    "the train of ultra - short optical pulses serves as the heart of the optical time transfer system . the precise timing information available from the comb and optical pulses are then transferred to a two - way lasercom optical link to the satellite .",
    "the individual sub - systems , depicted by boxes in fig",
    ".  [ opticallink ] , have been developed in national standards laboratories and universities and have demonstrated outstanding performance for different specific applications .",
    "many critical scientific questions and technical challenges must be addressed , including : optimal encoding of precise timing and time ( epoch ) information on the optical pulses , pointing and satellite tracking , signal acquisition , mitigation of atmospheric turbulence and group delay effects and dispersion , determination of time ( epoch ) relative to gnss time and coordinate systems and orbit determination .",
    "our current studies are investigating how to optimally transfer precise atomic time ( epoch ) , time - interval , and frequency from high accuracy atomic clocks on the ground to satellites in space ( or alternatively between satellites in space ) .",
    "we aim to achieve the following : ( i ) @xmath11 ps timing precision between high accuracy atomic frequency standards on the ground and the stable clock in orbit , ( ii ) the atomic clock on the str should support timing stability at the 1ps level for time intervals between updates from ground clocks , ( iii ) the precision laser time - transfer and with an orbit above the atmosphere and most of the ionosphere the str satellite will provide higher precision measurements of gnss clocks in orbit , ( iv ) sub - mm orbit determination from a combination of the two - way lasercom system and signals from a multitude of gnss satellites , and perhaps augmented by other systems ( two - way microwave link , vlbi ) , and ( v ) high precision time- and frequency - transfer , enabling comparison of ground clocks at the @xmath2 fractional frequency . with the right combination of existing clocks , lasers and related technologies it is now feasible to improve the timing precision in space and time distribution around the world by roughly a factor of a thousand , from the few nanosecond from gnss systems to the picosecond level . in the laboratory",
    "we have been evaluating system configurations , architectures and components that can give high performance in timing , time and frequency and that are robust and of sufficiently low power that it is reasonable to expect that these could be used in space in the near future . our optical timing and time - transfer system",
    "is based on a self - referenced fs mode - locked erbium fiber laser ( menlo systems ) that can be locked to either an rf or optical frequency reference .",
    "currently we simulate the time transfer link using a 4 km round - trip optical fiber between buildings on campus .",
    "even without fiber link stabilization we can achieve timing noise densities of much less than 1ps on the optical pulses and timing noise densities of several fs/@xmath3 on the optical carrier .",
    "dedicated optical links on the ground have already demonstrated timing precision at the femtosecond level over fiber and short free - space distances , so the stability of the laser systems and ground clocks would not be the limiting factor.@xcite achieving ps timing precision between ground and space would be a major advance for satellite systems and could significantly improve the performance of existing space navigation systems .",
    "this project is motivated by trying to bring the capabilities of advanced atomic clocks to space .",
    "the widespread practical utility of precise time and space reference naturally bring potentially synergistic connections to existing and growing gnss and applications , including proposed geodetic and geoscience missions where precise orbit determination and relative position measurements are critical for validating terrestrial reference frames , understanding earth plate motions , water / ice movement , and geodetic and earth science missions .",
    "this type of approach could serve as an exceptional platform for testing aspects of spacetime dependence of fundamental physics including general relativity and searches for new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "for some fundamental physics experiments and earth science applications it could be advantageous to operate the str satellite as a drag - free satellite using an inertial test mass reference to further reduce external perturbations to the orbit.@xcite",
    "we gratefully acknowledge support from the nasa fundamental physics and darpa - quasar programs ."
