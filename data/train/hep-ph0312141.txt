    "prof .  efremov gives us the opportunity to point out in this festschrift the influence of his work on our own research activities .",
    "a.  v.  efremov is one of the inventors of factorization theorems in quantum field theory that are particularly indispensable in applying perturbative qcd in inclusive @xcite and exclusive reactions @xcite involving hadrons . without these tools ,",
    "the experimental verification of qcd would constitute an intractable task . together with his then student a.  v.  radyushkin he accomplished the factorization theorems for the meson form factors , linking diagrammatic techniques with the operator product expansion ( ope ) .",
    "the grounds for these works were supplied by previous investigations by efremov @xcite and efremov and collaborators @xcite .",
    "moreover , efremov and radyushkin have diagonalized the anomalous dimensions matrix for meson operators ( in leading order ) in terms of gegenbauer polynomials and first obtained the asymptotic distribution amplitude ( da ) @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "factorization theorems @xcite make it possible to calculate various hard processes in qcd involving mesons , in which the meson das enter as the central nonperturbative input .    in the context of the present occasion , we are primarily interested in presenting recent achievements in describing the pion characteristics by mapping out its internal quark structure . a short note on the nucleon is also included .",
    "the pion da of twist-2 , @xmath3 , is a gauge- and process - independent characteristic of the pion that universally specifies the longitudinal momentum @xmath4 distribution of valence quarks in the pion with momentum @xmath5 @xmath6 and where @xmath7 $ ] is a phase factor , path - ordered along the straight line connecting the points @xmath8 and @xmath9 to preserve gauge invariance .",
    "the pion da encapsulates the long - distance effects and therefore reflects the nonperturbative features of the qcd vacuum .",
    "the latter can be effectively parameterized in terms of non - local condensates , as developed in @xcite by a.  radyushkin and two of us ( a.b . and s.m . ) .",
    "this provides a reliable method to construct hadron das that inherently accounts for the fact that quarks and gluons can flow through the qcd vacuum with _ non - zero _ momentum @xmath11 .",
    "this means , in particular , that the _ average _ virtuality of vacuum quarks , @xmath12 is not zero , like in the local sum - rule approach  @xcite , but can have values in the range  @xcite @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the non - local condensates in the coordinate representation , say , @xmath14 , are no longer _ constants _ , but depend on the interval @xmath15 in euclidean space and decay with the correlation length @xmath16 . lacking an exact knowledge of non - local condensates of higher dimensionality , one has de facto to resort to specific anztze @xcite , in order to parameterize the non - local condensates . nevertheless , it is important to stress that we were able to determine in @xcite @xmath17 directly from the cleo data @xcite within the range predicted by qcd sum rules @xcite and lattice simulations @xcite , favoring the value @xmath18 .",
    "the distribution amplitudes @xmath19 for the pion and its first resonance can be related to the non - local condensates by means of the following sum rule that is based on the correlator of two axial currents @xmath20 where the index @xmath21 runs over scalar , vector , and tensor condensates @xcite , @xmath22 is the borel parameter , and @xmath23 is the duality interval in the axial channel . above , the dependence on the non - locality parameter enters on the rhs in the way exemplified by the numerically important scalar - condensate contribution @xmath24         +   \\left(\\bar x\\rightarrow x\\right ) + \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\qquad\\quad         + \\theta(1>\\delta)\\theta\\left(\\delta > x>\\bar\\delta\\right )           \\left[\\bar\\delta                + \\left(\\delta-2\\bar xx\\right)\\ln(\\delta)\\right ]           \\bigr\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in the so - called _ local _ approach  @xcite , the end - point contributions ( @xmath28 or @xmath29 )",
    "are strongly enhanced by @xmath30 because they disregard the finiteness of the vacuum correlation length @xmath31 by setting in eq .",
    "( [ phis ] ) @xmath32 to obtain @xmath33.\\ ] ] in contrast , taking into account the non - locality of the condensates via @xmath17 , leads to a strong suppression of these regions . due to the end - point suppression property ,",
    "the sum rule ( [ eq : nlcsrda ] ) allows us to determine the first ten moments @xmath34 of the pion da and _ independently _ also the inverse moment @xmath35 quite accurately ( see in @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the intrinsic accuracy of this procedure admits to obtain the pion da moments with uncertainties varying in the range of 10% .",
    "models for the pion da , in correspondence to the extracted moments , can be constructed    l9 cm +    in different ways @xcite . however , on the grounds explained above , it appears that two - parameter models , the parameters being the first gegenbauer coefficients @xmath36 and @xmath37 , enable one to fit all the moment constraints for @xmath38 , as well as to reproduce the value of @xmath39 within the qcd sum - rule error range , resulting into a `` bunch '' of das displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : pion_das ] .",
    "the optimum sample out of this `` bunch '' , termed bms model , is described by the following expression @xmath40   \\label{optg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath41 , @xmath42 and is emphasized by a solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : pion_das ] .",
    "the shape of this `` bunch '' is confirmed by a non - diagonal correlator , based on the qcd sum rules considered in @xcite .",
    "the cleo data @xcite on @xmath43 provide one rigorous constraint on theoretical models for the pion da in qcd .",
    "indeed , it was first shown in @xcite that these data exclude the cz pion da because the prediction derived from it overshoots these data by orders of magnitude .",
    "very recently , we analyzed @xcite the cleo data by combining attributes from qcd light - cone sum rules @xcite , nlo efremov ",
    "lepage ( erbl ) @xcite evolution @xcite , and detailed estimates of uncertainties owing to higher - twist contributions and nnlo perturbative corrections @xcite .",
    "the upshot of this analysis is that the cz pion da is excluded at the 4@xmath1 level of accuracy and  perhaps somewhat surprisingly  that also the asymptotic pion da    l9 cm +    lies outside the 3@xmath1 error ellipse in the ( @xmath44 ) plane ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ellipse ] ) , even if one allows the theoretical uncertainties owing to unknown higher - twist contributions to be of the order of 30% and presumes that the size of nnlo perturbative corrections is also large . on the other hand , the bms pion da calculated with a vacuum virtuality @xmath18",
    "was found to be inside the 1@xmath1 error ellipse , while other rival models , based on differing instantons approaches @xcite , or derived with the aid of lattice simulations @xcite , are located in the vicinity of the border of the 3@xmath1 contour .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the more precise the instanton - based models become , the further away from the asymptotic pion da towards the region of the `` bunch '' they move ( we refer to @xcite for more details ) .. however , reverting this model to an approximate one by utilizing only two ( effective ) gegenbauer coefficients @xmath45 and @xmath46 shows that it is close to the 3@xmath1 error ellipse boundary , as said above . ]",
    "it was pointed out before in @xcite that the cleo data ask for a broader pion da than the asymptotic one .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : formfactor ] ( left panel ) we compare our prediction for the scaled pion - photon transition form factor with those from the cz model ( upper dashed line ) and the asymptotic da ( lower dashed line ) .",
    "one observes that the strip obtained from the `` bunch '' of das is in very good agreement with both the cleo data and also with the cello data @xcite .",
    "the right panel of this figure illustrates in the form of a shaded band the region of uncertainty induced by our limited knowledge of higher - twist contributions .",
    "one observes that even the low-@xmath47 cello data are in reasonable compliance with the theoretical prediction ( the shaded strip ) .     in comparison with the cello ( diamonds , @xcite ) and the cleo ( triangles , @xcite ) experimental data evaluated with the twist-4 parameter value @xmath48  gev@xmath49  @xcite .",

    "factorization theorems can be extended  at least formally  to baryons and their form factors @xcite .",
    "the primary goal below is to give a brief summary of main results rather than to review the subject and the status of individual exclusive processes or baryon das ( for a recent review , we refer to @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , the situation concerning the nucleon da is more controversial compared to the meson case .",
    "it is undoubtedly true that the asymptotic nucleon da is unable to describe the nucleon form factors @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , asymmetric das constructed via moments determined by _ local _ qcd sum rules following @xcite , as , for example , in @xcite ( see on the left part of fig .",
    "[ fig : spec400 ] for an illustration ) , seem to yield to strongly suppressed results for the magnetic nucleon form factor when transverse momentum ",
    "intrinsic and sudakov  effects are included @xcite .",
    "valuable information on the inner structure of the nucleon was recently provided in @xcite in the context of instantons , where it was shown that the shape of the proton da is far from the asymptotic one .",
    "while the nonperturbative nature of the nucleon is yet not well - understood , its evolution on the basis of the renormalization - group equation can be performed to a high level of accuracy within qcd perturbation theory .",
    "indeed , within the basis of symmetrized appell polynomials @xcite , the nucleon evolution equation can be solved by employing factorization of the dependence on the longitudinal momentum from that on the external ( large ) momentum scale @xmath54 up to any desired polynomial order .",
    "the spectrum of the corresponding anomalous dimensions of trilinear quark operators was also determined @xcite and its large - order behavior seems to increase logarithmically , reflecting the enhanced emission of soft gluons that forces the probability for finding bare quarks to decrease ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spec400 ] , right panel ) .",
    "this spectrum can be reproduced by the logarithmic fit @xmath55 the upper envelope of the spectrum is best described by the following values of the parameters with their errors : @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 . for the lower envelope ,",
    "the corresponding values are @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "the spacing of eigenvalues at very large order is reproduced by the values @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 . for every order @xmath65",
    ", there are @xmath66 eigenfunctions of the same order with an excess of symmetric ( under the permutation @xmath67 ) terms ( denoted by black dots in fig .  [ fig : spec400 ] ) by one for even orders .",
    "the total number of eigenfunctions up to order @xmath65 is @xmath68 and the corresponding @xmath69 eigenvalues are obtained by diagonalizing the @xmath70 matrix . up to order 150 , both sectors ( corresponding to the permutation parity @xmath71 ) of eigenvalues",
    "are included . beyond that order , for reasons of technical convenience ,",
    "only the antisymmetric ( open circles ) ones have been taken into account .",
    "the multiplet structure of the anomalous dimensions spectrum was found independently later on @xcite in the context of a hamiltonian approach to the one - dimensional xxx heisenberg spin magnet of non - compact spin @xmath72 .    .",
    "the solid lines ( upper and lower envelopes of the spectrum ) represent logarithmic fits up to the maximum considered order 400 , taking into consideration all orders above 10 .",
    "the dashed line gives for comparison a previous logarithmic fit @xcite which takes into account all orders up to 150 .",

    "our discussion of the pion da in the context of qcd sum rules with non - local condensates shows that the vacuum non - locality parameter can serve to extract valuable information on the underlying nonperturbative dynamics .",
    "the double - humped shape with suppressed end - points of the derived pion da is in good agreement with the cleo data with a 1@xmath1 accuracy and agrees with the cello data as well .",
    "progress of the non - local sum - rules approach to encompass tree - quarks states , like the nucleon , appears promising , while the perturbative apparatus for the evolution of such das is already well - developed .    in conclusion ,",
    "let us mention as a personal statement that the major part of our scientific work depends to a great extent on the power of factorization theorems and their usage in qcd in the context of form factors , structure functions , etc .",
    "therefore , we feel particularly attached to prof .",
    "efremov , given also that he was the leader of the bltph qcd group , where two of us ( a.p.b . and s.v.m . ) have been working for over a decade , and he was also one of the opponents of one of us ( n.g.s . ) in defending his _ doctor fiziko - matematicheskih nauk _ degree .",
