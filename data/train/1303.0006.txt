    "the lyman alpha emission line ( ly@xmath0 ) , emitted by the spontaneous de - excitation over the @xmath6 electronic transition in neutral hydrogen ( hi ) , is now an established observational probe of evolving galaxies in the high-@xmath7 universe @xcite .",
    "exploitation of ly@xmath0has resulted in significant galaxy surveys @xcite , the next generations of which will recover vast numbers of galaxies .",
    "however the hi  abundance in most galaxies , combined with the large ly@xmath0  absorption cross section of ground - state hydrogen , suggests that most ly@xmath0  will be absorbed and re - scattered by the same transition that created it .",
    "thus most ly@xmath0  photons are thought to be subject to multiple scattering events as they encounter neutral gas , resulting in a complicated radiative transport @xcite .        because hi  is often found at distances that exceed the size of stellar disks and star - forming regions @xcite , characteristic ly@xmath0  scale lengths may be expected to be substantially larger than those of , for example , the fuv continuum or h@xmath0 .",

    "we present our first imaging results in this paper as a series of rgb composite images in figures  [ fig : rgb1 ] and [ fig : rgb2 ] . in green",
    "we encode the far uv continuum , which traces the unobscured massive stars , and roughly incorporates the sites that produce the ionizing photons . in the red",
    "we show continuum - subtracted h@xmath0 , which traces the nebulae where the aforementioned ionizing photons are reprocessed into the recombination line spectrum .",
    "the continuum subtracted ly@xmath0  observation is encoded in blue .",
    "the images have been adaptively smoothed using a variable gaussian kernel ( ` filter / adaptive ` in ` eso / midas ` ) , in order to enhance positive regions of low surface brightness emission .",
    "the intensity scaling of all the images is logarithmic , and the levels are set to show the maximum of structure and the level at which the faintest features fade into the background .",
    "immediately it can be seen that ly@xmath0  morphologies bear limited resemblance to those of the fuv and h@xmath0 . in some cases",
    "ly@xmath0  appears to be almost completely absent : lars04 and 06 in particular show only small hints of ly@xmath0  emission that contribute negligibly towards filling in the global absorption , and the composites are dominated by uv and h@xmath0  light .",
    "ly@xmath0  is strongly absorbed , particularly in the central regions of these objects .",
    "others show copious ly@xmath0  emission and reveal morphological structures that are not seen at other wavelengths .",
    "most obviously , lars01 , 02 , 05 , 07 , 12 , and 14 show large - scale halos of ly@xmath0   emission that completely encompass the star - forming regions , although the same phenomenon is visible to some extent in all the objects , even the absorbers .",
    "we have discussed this extended ly@xmath0  emission in depth in the past @xcite .",
    "however now , with an observational setup that is more sensitive to faint levels of ly@xmath0   and a larger and uv - selected sample ( stlin et al , in prep ) , we are able to robustly quantify and contrast these sizes and the relative extension of ly@xmath0 .",
    "in order to quantify the sizes of the galaxies at various wavelengths , we adopt the petrosian radius @xcite with index of @xmath18 : i.e. the radius , @xmath19 , at which the local surface brightness is 20 percent the average surface brightness inside of @xmath19 . in hayes et al .",
    "( in prep ) we will show the ly@xmath0  extent of some objects to be so large that acs / sbc can not capture the full flux , and hence measurements like 50 percent light radius are not robust .",
    "indeed petrosian radii were developed to be depth - independent measures of size .",
    "we note from experimentation , however , that very similar conclusions are reached using other definitions .",
    "the choice of @xmath18 gives a size for every ly@xmath0-emitting galaxy in the sample except lars09 , for which even at the full extent of the sbc we do not come close to crossing the @xmath18 threshold .",
    "we reach the edge of the detector at @xmath20 ( @xmath21  kpc ) and can expect the true extent of ly@xmath0 to be much larger . for the 11 galaxies in which @xmath4  is well measured , its determination is robust , and would not change were the observations deeper or the field - of - view larger .",
    "@xmath2 , is computed for ly@xmath0 , h@xmath0 , and the fuv continuum , and listed in table  [ tab : quants ] .",
    "based upon aperture - matched h@xmath0  and h@xmath8  imaging and standard case b assumptions , we recover up to 60  % of the intrinsic ly@xmath0flux , although the median value is just @xmath22  % ( hayes et al . in prep ) .",

    "[ tab : quants ] we also report the _ relative petrosian extension _ of ly@xmath0  compared to h@xmath0 , @xmath3 , which is simply defined as @xmath4/@xmath5 .",

    "the galaxy with the largest extension is lars14 , for which we measure @xmath3=3.6 .",
    "it is not clear whether globally absorbing galaxies lars04 and 06 become emitters on larger scales , but if so their @xmath4  must be larger than the radius of the sbc chip , implying that @xmath3  must exceed 5.3 and 13.4 , respectively .",
    "that would make them the most extended objects in the sample .",
    "excluding these two galaxies , and also lars09 for which we can only provide a lower limit , the sample mean ( median ) is computed as 2.43 ( 2.28 ) .",
    "it is important to note that fuv radii imply that all the galaxies would be effectively unresolved by ground - based observations if they were at @xmath26 .",
    "the largest is 8  kpc , which corresponds to the 1 arcsec resolution that could be expected from the seeing .",
    "however one of the objects has a ly@xmath0  radius of 15.5  kpc : recovering this total flux at @xmath27 would require an aperture of at least 2 arcsec .",
    "some objects are also highly elongated and were they pushed to the high-@xmath7 universe , much of their ly@xmath0  could also be unmeasured if circular apertures are used .",
    "ly@xmath0  emission more extended than the fuv has been reported in numerous high-@xmath7 samples .",
    "@xcite remarked upon a few such objects at the brighter end of the luminosity distribution of the 27 narrowband selected galaxies , and the extremely deep spectroscopic observations of @xcite uncovered 28 ly@xmath0  galaxies , ten of which were classified as extended .",
    "samples of ly@xmath0  blobs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may be many times the size of their counterpart galaxies , if indeed counterparts are identified at all . here",
    "we report that every galaxy in the sample that emits ly@xmath0  does so by producing a halo ; on average the halo is over twice the linear size of h@xmath0  and the fuv .    by stacking narrowband images of lbgs at @xmath28",
    ", @xcite reported ly@xmath0  halos that extend many tens of kpc , probably probing the neutral circumgalactic medium ( cgm ) out to the virial radius .",
    "subdividing the full sample by ly@xmath0  properties , the halos at radii larger than 2030 physical kpc show very similar scale lengths in all subsamples ( although different central surface brightnesses ) , even when central ly@xmath0  absorption is found . at small radii the subsamples exhibit profiles that differ markedly , dropping rapidly to @xmath29 for the ly@xmath0-absorbing sample but steepening by varying degrees in all others .",
    "even the steepest central profiles , however , still run much flatter than those of the stellar continuum , and this change likely marks the onset of higher density gaseous disks or similar .    from the various @xmath30 ly@xmath0  profiles of @xcite",
    "we calculate @xmath4  using the same method as for our sample , and dividing by @xmath24  from the continuum profile we obtain @xmath3  ( now relative to the uv ) .",
    "these raw values range between @xmath3=3.8 for the non - laes , and 5.9 for the lae - only sample , and are notably bigger than our largest @xmath3 .",
    "however , under the assumption that the inner and outer profiles mark physically different regimes that may not be the same in low-@xmath7 galaxies , we also subtract the exponential halo fits of @xcite and repeat the exercise ; this yields a range of @xmath3=0.84 to 2.0 .",
    "this is now smaller than many of our values , although close to the average and the dispersion of the high-@xmath7 sample is obviously lost in the stacking process . on the other hand ,",
    "the uv continuum profile of @xcite is dominated by atmospheric seeing .",
    "if we instead use the continuum effective radius of bm / bx galaxies and lbgs from hst imaging @xcite we compute @xmath24@xmath31  kpc , which would increase all the @xmath3  quoted above by a factor of 2.5 .",
    "@xmath3  from the raw data would then become much larger than we measure in the local universe ( up to 15 ) , and @xmath3  in halo - subtracted profiles that are roughly consistent ( 2.1 to 4.8 ) .",
    "lars observations probe scales far below the tens of kpc sampled at high-@xmath7 on a case - by - case basis .",
    "the galaxies likely include the range between , or roughly bracketing , the averaged subsamples of @xcite .",
    "our imaging also suggests this extension to be a very common property of ly@xmath0-emitting galaxies , and its onset begins almost immediately in the inner few kpc : we find seven galaxies with fuv petrosian radii below 2  kpc , five of which have corresponding ly@xmath0  radii three times larger .",
    "it is also noteworthy that @xcite find different median dust attenuations for the ly@xmath0-emitting and non - emitting subsamples , almost precisely as we did in @xcite .",
    "laes , which show extended central peaks , were determined to have stellar @xmath32=0.09 magnitudes ( c.f .",
    "0.085 in @xcite ) while absorbers show @xmath32=0.19 ( c.f .",
    "0.23 for our h@xmath0-selected sample ) . adopting the prescription of @xcite the stellar @xmath32  measurements for the steidel et al .",
    "samples correspond to @xmath8 slopes .",
    "] of @xmath33 ( laes ) and @xmath34 ( ly@xmath0  absorbers ) . bluntly accounting for a factor of 2.27 that connects stellar @xmath32  to its nebular equivalent in local starbursts @xcite , the same stellar",
    "@xmath32  would equate to h@xmath0/h@xmath8  ratios of 3.5 ( laes ) and 4.4 ( absorbers ) . in the next section",
    "we will show case - by - case that ly@xmath0  halos systematically become more extended with decreasing dust contents .",
    "in hayes et al . ( in prep ) we compute many global properties for the sample , in order to study the processes complicit in ly@xmath0  transport .",
    "indeed that paper will include a complete analysis of correlations between ly@xmath0  transmission , halo sizes , and many other properties ; in this _ letter _ we restrict ourselves to observables that scale with the dust content .",
    "it is noteworthy for the moment , however , that we find no correlation between @xmath3  and the total ly@xmath0  luminosity . in figure",
    "[ fig : corr ] we show how @xmath3   compares with both the uv continuum slope @xmath8 and the h@xmath0/h@xmath8  ratio .",
    "we note that the sdss fibers are on average smaller than the ly@xmath0  radii , but do capture the bulk of the nebular emission , and fluxes can easily be measured without contamination of [ nii ]  and stellar absorption . since",
    "@xcite @xmath8 has been used almost ubiquitously as a proxy of stellar attenuation in high-@xmath7 galaxies ; here we measure @xmath8 from aperture - matched hst imaging using the fuv ( sbc / f140lp or f150lp ) and the @xmath35band ( uvis / f336w or f390w ) filters . with colors between @xmath36 and @xmath37 our objects have similar uv slopes to the vast majority of those found in @xmath38 ly@xmath0-emitting galaxies @xcite .",
    "similarly the h@xmath0/h@xmath8  ratio is the canonical probe of nebular reddening ( i.e. that which is to zeroth order expected for ly@xmath0 ) used in studies of low-@xmath7 and galactic nebulae . @xmath8 and h@xmath0/h@xmath8",
    "are listed in table  [ tab : quants ] .    both measures of dust content strongly anti -",
    "correlate with @xmath3   although the sample is small ( @xmath39 defined sizes in ly@xmath0 ) . to assess its significance",
    "we compute the spearman rank correlation coefficient , @xmath40 , which yields @xmath41 and @xmath42 for the anti - correlation of @xmath3  with @xmath8 and h@xmath0/h@xmath8 , respectively .",
    "this corresponds to likelihoods of the null hypothesis  that this correlation arises purely by chance  amounting to 0.7 percent ( uv slope ) , and 3.6 percent ( h@xmath0/h@xmath8 ) .",
    "the halo  dust phenomenon appears not to be a direct effect of radiative transfer .",
    "we have performed new test simulations with the ` mclya ` code @xcite , by tuning the gas - to - dust ratio in the synthetic galaxy of @xcite .",
    "indeed the surface brightness does scale with dust abundance but the light profile ( therefore @xmath4 ) does not , and the @xmath3dust trend must be a secondary correlation",
    ". a scenario is needed in which galaxies decrease the relative size of their hi   envelopes as the absolute dust content increases .",
    "a sequence in which neutral gas settles into the galaxy ( reducing @xmath3 ) and subsequently forms stars ( creating more dust ) would explain the trend , but without yet having obtained spatially resolved hi  data this is conjecture .",
    "scattering also has the potential to spread ly@xmath0  over such an area that its surface brightness decreases greatly .",
    "in such a case , scattered radiation measured at large radii may not be sufficient to recover flux from a broad central absorption , making @xmath3   observationally undefined when it is actually very large .",
    "the trend of @xmath3  increasing in bluer galaxies , then , is also able to explain the undefined sizes of lars 04 and 06 , at their measured dust abundance .",
    "similar considerations would also explain the non - detection of ly@xmath0  in local gas - rich but metal- and dust - poor dwarf starbursts such as izw18 and sbs0335052 @xcite , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we have empirically shown before @xcite that the global escape fraction of ly@xmath0photons anti - correlates strongly with attenuation ( also @xcite in lbgs ) .",
    "we now demonstrate that at lower @xmath32 , the more strongly emitting galaxies are likely to also spread their ly@xmath0  over larger surfaces . thus while they do transmit more of their ly@xmath0 , it may be that more of the transferred ly@xmath0  is observationally lost outside photometric apertures .",
    "this may also explain the lack of correlation between ly@xmath0/h@xmath8  and @xmath32  observed by @xcite , compared to trends seen in other samples : the aperture of the iue probed just 3  kpc at @xmath43 and if more ly@xmath0  is lost in bluer galaxies the ly@xmath0/balmer ratios would be artificially lowered in in such systems .",
    "this could in part mask an underlying correlation . by a similar token",
    ", galaxies that can very efficiently scatter ly@xmath0  photons may not be recovered at all , despite frequently showing very blue uv colors .",
    "determining precisely how ly@xmath0  profiles are modified for a given set of host properties will provide a cornerstone for interpreting future large high-@xmath7 surveys .",
