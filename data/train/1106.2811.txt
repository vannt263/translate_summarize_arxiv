    ". this line can carry up to @xmath56% of the bolometric luminosity of a star forming galaxy ( partridge & peebles 1967 ) , therefore it is an easy handle for detection of both star forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei ( agn , where   emission is powered by the ionizing photons produced at the accretion disk around the central massive black hole ) at redshifts @xmath14 2 . the  line - search technique has been used successfully to identify samples of high redshift galaxies for over a decade , using narrowband images ( e.g. , cowie & hu 1998 ; rhoads et al .",

    "there are thousands of photometrically selected  emitters ( hereafter laes ) , with hundreds of spectroscopic confirmations ( e.g. , hu et al . 2004 , dawson et al .",
    "2007 , wang et al . 2009 ) at redshifts ranging from @xmath15 0.3 ( deharveng et al .",

    "2006 ) .",
    "since  line searches have achieved notable success in identifying high redshift star - forming galaxies , it is very important to understand the radiation transfer of the  emission line .",
    "however , interpreting the  line is not trivial , because  photons are resonantly scattered when they interact with the surrounding neutral hydrogen in the inter - stellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "these radiative transfer effects can be quite complex when considering the presence of dust in a multiphase and moving interstellar medium ( neufeld 1991 , hansen & oh 2006 ; finkelstein et al .",
    "2009c ) , and require empirical study of the fraction of  photons of which can escape the ism .",
    "_ indeed , empirical results on the  escape fraction offer one of the better tools for probing the physics of  escape , which is determined on spatial scales that are usually unresolved in distant or nearby galaxies .",
    "_ on the theory side , semi - analytical models of lae populations by le delliou et al .",
    "( 2005 ) assume a constant escape fraction of f@xmath16 = 0.02 , and hydrodynamical models of laes at z @xmath5 3 predict f@xmath16 = 0.05 - 0.1 ( nagamine et al . 2010 , shimizu et al .",
    "2011 ) .    on the observational side ,",
    "to measure the fraction of  photons escaping the ism ( hereafter the  escape fraction ) , we often require a flux measurement in ultraviolet ( uv ) continuum or a non - resonant recombination line , such as h@xmath8 , and a dust extinction value .",
    "the dust corrected uv luminosity or h@xmath8 luminosity , like the intrinsic  luminosity , are mainly contributed by young stars , thus connected to the intrinsic star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "recent constraints at z @xmath5 0.3 ( atek et al . 2009 ) and at z @xmath52.25 ( hayes et al . 2010 ) are based on the line ratio between h@xmath8 and . with the optical spectroscopic observation of galex selected laes , atek et al .",
    "( 2009 ) showed that the  escape fractions span a wide range ( from f@xmath16 @xmath5 0.5 to 100 % ) and decrease with increasing dust extinction .",
    "hayes et al .",
    "( 2010 ) estimated an average  escape fraction of @xmath5 5% with a double blind survey targeting  and h@xmath8 at z = 2.25 . with",
    "the dust - corrected uv emission of 98 laes at z @xmath17 1.9 - 3.8 detected through integral - field spectroscopy survey , blanc et al .",
    "( 2010 ) got a median  escape fraction of 29% .",
    "however , the escape fractions estimated from both of these methods are sensitive to the dust extinction law .",
    "for example , under the case b recombination , if we ignore the resonant scattering and velocity field in the gas or ism geometry , the  escape fraction is presented as f@xmath16 = 10@xmath18 ( atek et al .",
    "2009 ) , and the extinction coefficient at  wavelength goes from @xmath19 @xmath5 9.9 to 12.8 for cardelli et al . ( 1989 ) and calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) laws , respectively .",
    "this will lead to a factor of two difference in the inferred f@xmath16 when e(b - v ) @xmath20 0.3 .",
    "meanwhile , the escape fractions estimated here also depend on the selection methods of laes . at z @xmath5 0.3 ,",
    "the laes are selected from a spectroscopic followup of fuv dropouts ( atek et al .",
    "2009 ) , so the escape fractions here refer to a subsample of dropout galaxies at that redshift . at z @xmath5 2.25 ,",
    "the average  escape fraction is estimated from 18 laes and 55 h@xmath8 emitters , and only 6 have both  and h@xmath8 detection ( hayes et al .",
    "so the escape fraction at z@xmath5 2.25 estimated by hayes et al .",
    "( 2010 ) is a global  escape fraction for all galaxies at that redshift .",
    "the narrowband surveys for high - z laes can be designed to use the same criteria , e.g. , the threshold equivalent width of ew@xmath21 @xmath20 20   and the  line flux limit estimated from narrowband and broadband images , however , we should note that the  escape fraction is dependent on the choice of the threshold equivalent width , and the narrowband exposure depth .",
    "shallower narrowband surveys tend to select bright laes , which may have smaller  ews ( e.g. , ando et al .",
    "2006 ) , and a decrease in the value of threshold equivalent width will contain more objects with little - to - no  fluxes as well as interlopers .",
    "x - ray photons , especially hard x - ray photons , can give an extinction - free measurement of star formation in galaxies .",
    "first , the x - ray emission of high - redshift star - forming galaxies are mainly from supernovae ( sne ) , hot interstellar gas ( i.e. , @xmath22 k ) , and high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , all of which trace star formation ongoing in the last few million years .",
