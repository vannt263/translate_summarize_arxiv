    "one of the aims of the novel field of relativistic quantum information is to study the correlations present between field modes as seen by both inertial and accelerated observers . in this context",
    ", there have appeared a number of works studying fermionic fields in non - inertial frames @xcite .",
    "one of the most well - known scenarios consists in the analysis of the quantum correlations shared between an inertial mode of a fermionic field and an accelerated one , as a function of the latter s acceleration .",
    "most of the previous literature was centred only in the analysis of pure states from the inertial perspective , where some entanglement was always found to survive in the infinite acceleration limit ( see previous citations ) .",
    "this contrasts with the case of bosonic fields , where no field entanglement has ever been found to survive at infinite acceleration limit , and where it is possible even to completely cancel entanglement at any finite acceleration @xcite .",
    "this survival of fermionic entanglement at finite acceleration has been usually linked to the pauli exclusion principle , which would arguably maintain some entanglement of statistical nature at any value of the acceleration @xcite .",
    "this has led to some works showing that , for some field states , the entanglement at infinite acceleration is not usable for quantum information @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in some recent works , fermionic entanglement behaviour for a family of werner states has been studied @xcite finding fermionic entanglement extinction at finite acceleration for some states of this 1-parametric family . on the other hand , some other works @xcite found that if we consider a fermionic tripartite field w - state shared by two accelerated observers , @xmath0 and @xmath1 and one inertial , a , i.e. @xmath2 and then for whatever reason we trace out the inertial observer ( which is equivalent to considering a system composed of two accelerated partners ) , then the resulting density matrix @xmath3 is entangled at zero acceleration , but shows no entanglement survival for sufficiently high accelerations of the observers .",
    "these particular cases show that the phenomenon of fermionic entanglement survival does not happen for any entangled state .",
    "summarising , working with fermionic fields is a necessary , but not sufficient , condition to observe entanglement survival .    in this work ,",
    "we study a setting composed of two accelerated observers who watch a general mixed state of two modes of a fermionic field .",
    "we generalise previous results about vanishing fermionic entanglement @xcite beyond the single mode approximation @xcite and their proper setting , considering both one and two accelereated observers .",
    "we also characterise how frequently this phenomenon of entanglement extinction arises by probing the whole space of density matrices rather than restricting to particular families of entangled states .",
    "we find that the abundance of mixed states that present the phenomenon is not negligible at all but , instead , it can be about 50% .",
    "finally we provide a measure of the degree of purity for which the phenomenon starts to manifest .",
    "our work is structured as follows : in section [ set ] , we present the setting under consideration and the necessary expressions for the study of field entanglement . section [ res ] contains our results about the distribution and characteristics of the phenomenon of vanishing entanglement at the infinite acceleration in general mixed states .",
    "finally , section [ cojoniak ] contains our conclusions .",
    "we consider two non - inertial observers in two causally disconnected patches of minkowski spacetime .",
    "these observers move with uniform proper accelerations , which are are not necessarily equal . in other words",
    ", they travel along lines of constant spacelike rindler coordinate .",
    "we will call the observers rob or rodney if they are in region i , and antirob or antirodney if they are in region ii , as depicted in fig.[rindler ] . note that although we will refer to the observers by different names depending on the spacetime wedge on which they are , we will always consider only two observers at a time .",
    "each observer probes a single mode of a grassmann scalar field @xcite , an anticommuting field with only one degree of freedom .",
    "we will analyse entanglement between these modes for different field states associated with different observers accelerations .",
    "the most natural way to describe the quantum field from the viewpoint of these uniformly accelerated observers is through field quantisation in the rindler basis .",
    "this means that , whereas an inertial observer would quantise the field using minkowski modes ( positive frequency solutions to the relevant field equation in minkowski coordinates ) to build up the fock space , it is more appropriate for our observers to quantise the field using rindler modes ( positive frequency solutions in rindler coordinates ) .",
    "this is so because any particle detector carried by the accelerated observers would couple directly to rindler rather than minkowski modes .",
    "the existence of two causally disconnected regions as depicted in fig .",
    "[ rindler ] implies that , for each rindler frequency , there are two different rindler modes , each of them having support only in either region i or ii . when considering a general field state both kinds of modes have to be taken into account .",
    "to study entanglement in non - inertial frames it is convenient to use of the so - called unruh modes @xcite .",
    "the annihilation operators associated with these modes have simple expressions in terms of rindler creation and annihilation operators for particles ( @xmath4 ) , and antiparticles ( @xmath5 ) , namely @xmath6 where @xmath7 , and @xmath8 indicates rindler frequency as measured by a rindler observer with proper acceleration @xmath9 .",
    "this acceleration is merely a convention which amounts to the choice of a specific rindler observer in order to label frequencies ; alternatively , we could index the modes by their dimensionless rindler frequency @xmath10 .",
    "the subscripts l and r stand for ` left ' and ` right ' modes , which are related to each other by a reversal of regions i and ii . these modes have the particularity of being linear combinations of purely positive - frequency minkowski modes .",
    "this implies that the minkowski and unruh vacua are the same .",
    "therefore , the hilbert space factorises as @xmath11 where each @xmath12 is annihilated by @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    given ( [ product ] ) , we only need to study detailedly two of the factors in the tensor product , one for each observer , and hence from now on we will consider only the frequencies @xmath15 for rob and @xmath16 for rodney . the relevant part of the vacuum will be written as @xmath17 we will consider arbitrary unruh excitations of the form @xcite @xmath18 the case @xmath19 corresponds to the choice previously known as the single mode approximation @xcite .    notice that we have endowed the fermionic fock space with a particular tensor product structure , one must be careful since the choice of a particular tensor product structure may affect entanglement .",
    "we will assume the most extended way of building the fermionic fock @xcite space as it allows us to easily find the relevant expressions for the field states and the main results about entanglement vanishment remain true .",
    "for a detailed study of these issues , see @xcite .",
    "to study field entanglement , we need to express the minkowski vacuum and the particle excitations in the rindler basis .",
    "this is easily done from eqs .",
    "( [ umodes ] ) and ( [ reduc ] ) once we impose that the vacuum be annihilated by all four relevant unruh operators @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "if , following previous notation @xcite , we choose a basis for each factor space in ( [ reduc ] ) by @xmath24 where @xmath25 due to pauli exclusion principle , the unruh vacuum may be expressed in the rindler basis through ( [ reduc ] ) with ( see @xcite ) @xmath26 the excitations can now be straightforwardly computed using ( [ reduc ] ) , ( [ excs ] ) and ( [ gvac ] ) .",
    "now we have the states necessary to study field entanglement as seen by two accelerated observers .",
    "one last point remains before the discussion of the formalism is complete : as it is obvious from fig.[rindler ] , an uniformly accelerated observer lying in one wedge of spacetime is causally disconnected from the other .",
    "it is therefore necessary for him to trace out the field modes which are unobservable .",
    "since we have two such observers which can lie in either regions of rindler spacetime , two partial traces need to be taken , resulting in one of the four following situations :    * rob - rodney , in which the region ii modes are traced out for both the @xmath15 and @xmath16 subspaces . *",
    "rob - antirodney , in which region ii modes are traced for @xmath15 and region i modes are traced for @xmath16 .",
    "* antirob - rodney , in which region i modes are traced for @xmath15 and region ii modes are traced for @xmath16 .",
    "* antirob - antirodney , in which region i modes are traced for both @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    in the next section",
    "we will study the behaviour of entanglement in all these situations , for a general mixed state of the two field modes under consideration .",
    "we note that , unlike in previous works @xcite where field entanglement between an inertial and an accelerated observer was considered , the inertial entanglement is not always recovered in the zero acceleration limit of our setting .",
    "although a naive expectation might be that this should be the case , it is not because of the discontinuity in localisation of the rindler and minkowski modes : whereas the former are always localised in region i or ii of spacetime , the latter are supported in the whole spacetime .",
    "we consider a general state described by a @xmath27 density matrix @xmath28 written in the basis @xmath29 this basis of unruh excitations is to be expressed in terms of the rindler basis by means of the results of section [ set ] .",
    "subsequently , the appropriate partial traces are taken , leaving us with a reduced state @xmath30 containing all the observable correlations between field modes .    as a distillable entanglement measure valid for mixed states ,",
    "we employ the negativity @xcite . from now on when we refer to the negativity of a bipartition we mean the negativity of the corresponding @xmath30 matrix .",
    "we will first study the phenomenon of entanglement extinction with a monte carlo method to probe the space of density matrices and find out the abundance of states whose entanglement dissapears for finite accelerations .",
    "then , motivated by the observation that entanglement extinction in the fermionic case appears only for non - pure states , we will obtain a typical distance ( in the sense of degree of purity ) between maximally entangled states and the first mixed states where the phenomenon appears .",
    "the relevant parameter space ( 4x4 state matrices ) is a 15-dimensional manifold , @xmath31 .",
    "we relied on a monte carlo method to numerically estimate the abundance of states showing some inertial entanglement which vanishes at infinite acceleration of both partners in the rob - rodney bipartition .",
    "our algorithm works as follows : first , we randomly generate a 4x4 matrix @xmath32 drawn from the ginibre ensemble @xcite ( normally distributed with identical variance in both real and imaginary parts of all its entries ) .",
    "then , a state matrix @xmath28 is obtained as @xmath33 and we checked wether if it had some inertial entanglement by directly computing the negativity of the matrix @xmath28 .",
    "if so , entanglement at infinite acceleration of both partners was studied .",
    "the use of a matrix @xmath32 in the ginibre ensemble , together with the correspondence ( [ ensemble ] ) , induces the hilbert - schmidt measure in @xmath31 @xcite , a measure both unitarily invariant ( meaning that any two measurable subsets @xmath34 and @xmath35 related through a unitary @xmath36 such that @xmath37 have the same measure ) and obtained from a metric .",
    "once we have a measure on @xmath31 , such questions as ` how many states show entanglement survival at infinite acceleration ? '",
    "become meaningful . though this unitarily invariant measure is not an unique choice @xcite , its behaviour",
    "is well understood under certain circumstances @xcite and is simple enough to generate states with .    to gain some physical insight on the behaviour of the induced measure in the space of density matrices",
    ", we generated @xmath38 states , plotting an histogram of their inertial negativities , which can be seen in figure [ histo ] .",
    "approximately @xmath39 of these states were entangled , distributing themselves over a gaussian .",
    "mixed states drawed from the ginibre ensemble and corresponding gaussian fit .",
    "note that only entangled states are shown ; the fraction of separable states ( zero negativity ) is much higher ( approximately @xmath40 ) . ]",
    "we found that from a sample of @xmath41 points , @xmath42 showed non - zero negativity , and that    * for @xmath43 ( the single mode approximation ) , @xmath44 of the states with nonvanishing inertial entanglement had zero entanglement in the limit of infinite acceleration for both observers . * for @xmath45",
    ", @xmath46 of the states with inertial nonvanishing entanglement had zero entanglement in the limit of infinite acceleration for both observers . * for @xmath47",
    ", @xmath48 of the states with nonvanishing inertial entanglement had zero entanglement in the limit of infinite acceleration for both observers .",
    "the results above show that the phenomenon of entanglement extinction at infinite acceleration ( and , as we shall see in subsection [ graf ] , at finite acceleration ) is fairly common and not a peculiarity of some specific family of states .",
    "also , the percentage of states showing the phenomenon drops with @xmath49 , which is consistent with previous results that going beyond the single mode approximation could result in entanglement amplification @xcite .      in this subsection ,",
    "some of the states showing the phenomenon of vanishing entanglement at infinite acceleration are analysed thoroughly . more specifically , we computed the negativity for all four possible bipartitions for the state ( [ ira ] ) which first showed the phenomenon . considering previous results in @xcite",
    ", it might have been reasonable to guess that entanglement is not destroyed , but rather transferred to the other bipartitions .",
    "this would have been expectable if we considered the results obtained when analysing maximally entangled states .",
    "we present our results in figure [ stats ] .     and @xmath50 for the state ( [ ira ] ) .",
    "the upper part of the graph corresponds to the rob - rodney bipartition , and the lower one , to rob - antirodney .",
    "the negativity of the antirob - rodney bipartition is diagonal - symmetric to that of rob - antirodney , and the antirob - antirodney bipartition is always zero . ]",
    "we remark that , whenever there is entanglement vanishing at some acceleration in the rob - rodney bipartition , the entanglement vanishes in all other bipartitions and for all values of acceleration as well .",
    "we have thus established that entanglement is not merely being redistributed among the various possible bipartitions , but rather that it is lost .",
    "although true for pure entangled states , it is not true in general that fermionic statistics directly implies entanglement survival .",
    "we have seen that for some non - pure fermionic states , entanglement extinction due to acceleration might happen . however , it is true that entanglement survival in the infinite acceleration limit is only possible if there is some entanglement transfer to other bipartitions , as it was concluded in @xcite . note that the correlations between rob and antirodney only show up when @xmath51 is far from @xmath50 . in other words , there are only correlations in this bipartition if the accelerations or the field modes they watch are very different .",
    "the region where entanglement is zero for all bipartitions does not include points with @xmath52 or @xmath53 .",
    "however , for other states , such as the one given by the density matrix @xmath54,\\nonumber\\\\\\beta&= \\left [ \\begin{array}{cccc }    0 & -0.0089 & -0.0645 & -0.0339 \\\\",
    "0.0089 & 0 & -0.0233 & 0.0149 \\\\    0.0645 & 0.0233 & 0 & 0.0962 \\\\    0.0339 & -0.0149 & -0.0962 & 0 \\end{array }",
    "\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the region of vanishing entanglement does indeed include such points .",
    "since in the single mode approximation the limit of the unruh modes for zero acceleration yields modes confined to region i , this means that this behaviour is also present where there was only one accelerated observer .",
    "the only simple requirement is thus to consider mixed states , as pure states do not present this behaviour .    as mentioned above",
    ", there is some entanglement in the rob - antirodney bipartition whenever rob s acceleration is higher than antirodney s and these accelerations are not close . the corresponding result but with antirob - rodney correlations is also true .",
    "we also point out that all the states studied under the single mode approximation show the same qualitative behaviour : entanglement decreases monotonically along the diagonal up to a threshold value of @xmath55 where it hits zero , staying there onwards .",
    "higher values of inertial entanglement correspond to higher values of this threshold .",
    "it seems likely that the threshold can achieve all the values of @xmath55 if we allow arbitrarily low inertial entanglement , although we have not proved this .",
    "these results are derived assuming the single mode approximation @xmath43 .",
    "this assumption introduces a strong asymmetry between region i and region ii modes , which explains why there are no states showing the same behavior for the antirob - antirodney bipartition .",
    "figure [ stats2 ] shows the same plot for negativity as a function of acceleration for state ( [ ira ] ) , when @xmath47 .",
    "the behaviour is qualitatively different once the single mode approximation is relaxed ; there can be entanglement amplification maxima ( see @xcite ) and the negativity no longer gives rise to a smooth surface .",
    "also , due to the symmetry between regions present when @xmath47 , all four bipartitions result in the same surface .     and",
    "@xmath50 for the state ( [ ira ] ) and @xmath47 .",
    "the negativities of all bipartitions are equal since the use of unruh modes with @xmath47 makes regions i and ii completely equivalent . ]",
    "this phenomenon of entanglement destruction at infinite acceleration has only been observed for mixed states .",
    "since maximally entangled states are pure , this means that entanglement survival at infinite acceleration should be expected as long as we do not stray ` too far ' from maximally entangled states . to determine the precise meaning of",
    "` too far ' , we developed the following scheme : after generating a random state matrix @xmath56 in the same way as for the monte carlo algorithm above , we computed the negativity at @xmath57 under the single mode approximation as a function of @xmath58 for the family of states @xmath59,\\label{fam}\\\\{\\left| { \\psi } \\right\\rangle}&=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left({\\left| { 00 } \\right\\rangle}+{\\left| { 11 } \\right\\rangle}\\right ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] until a value of @xmath58 for which the negativity dropped to zero was found .",
    "this defines a function @xmath60 from the space of state matrices to the real numbers .",
    "since @xmath31 is compact it follows that @xmath61 has a minimum value , which may be regarded as a measure of how far from the maximally entangled state of our choice is the set of states with zero entanglement in the infinite acceleration limit .",
    "the process was repeated for @xmath38 random matrices , using the same generating method as in subsection [ mcsurv ] .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath58 was found to be @xmath62 .",
    "this means that for any one - parameter family of states of the form ( [ fam ] ) , with a high degree of certainty , the states never become mixed enough to wipe out entanglement at infinite acceleration before this value of @xmath58 is attained .",
    "this further confirms that the phenomenon is linked to non - coherent states , since it does not show up near entangled states .",
    "we have studied exhaustively the phenomenon reported in @xcite where it was shown that when one or two observers are accelerating some states show no entanglement survival in the infinite acceleration limit , contrary to previous insights that entanglement survival was the hallmark and a direct consequence of fermionic statistics .",
    "we have found that the phenomenon does not require two accelerated observers to show up , in accordance with @xcite , and that the only fundamental requisite is to consider mixed states .",
    "this general study is the first work in relativistic quantum information which explicitly considers aribitrary mixed states from the inertial perspective .",
    "we also performed our study beyond the single mode approximation .",
    "we characterised the phenomenon in a number of ways , finding it to be fairly common in the space of states of 4x4 density matrices , analysing its general features and providing a reasonable measure on the degree of nonpurity necessary to observe the effect .",
    "we found that entanglement is not transferred from one bipartition to another , but rather is completely erased .",
    "there are fundamental differences in the way bosonic and fermionic fields behave with acceleration , which have traditionally regarded as having a profound impact on the more detailed aspects of field entanglement . here",
    "we have studied all the possible bipartitions to which entanglement could have relocated , showing that entanglement completely disappears from our states and thus the phenomenon of fermionic entanglement survival is dependent on the detailed features of the field state , and not only on the form of the change of basis between minkowski and rindler bases .",
