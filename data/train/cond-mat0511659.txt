    "the properties of the corner - sharing tetrahedral lattice ( hereafter denoted by cstl ) are of interest in a wide variety of physical systems.@xcite this lattice is a non - bipartite , and thus frustrated , three dimensional structure that is the conducting path of electrons in many interesting systems .",
    "this network can be derived , _",
    "e.g. _ , from the diamond structure ( which is a bipartite lattice ) by placing a site at each bond midpoint.@xcite one interesting consequence from this construction is that , _",
    "e.g. _ , the critical ( classical ) site percolation threshold of pyrochlore is the same as the bond percolation threshold of diamond .",
    "also , this structure is a sublattice of many compounds , including pyrochlores and spinels . in the a@xmath7b@xmath7o@xmath8 pyrochlore structure , both",
    "the a and b sublattices can be realized as a network of corner - sharing tetrahedra , which is nowadays often referred to as the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "examples of the interesting ( quantum ) magnetic properties and superconducting behaviour of several pyrochlores are discussed in the literature.@xcite indeed , there exist many experimental results which seem to suggest that the geometrical frustration of the cstl in these compounds is responsible for their peculiar properties , and it has been argued that geometrical frustration tends to amplify the correlation and quantum effects.@xcite    the initial motivation for our work has to do with the electronic properties of the normal spinel ab@xmath7o@xmath6,@xcite in which the b sublattice forms a corner - sharing tetrahedral network",
    ". there are a large number of well known spinels , some with exotic magnetic@xcite and electronic properties.@xcite further , the recent discovery@xcite of the first @xmath9-electron heavy fermion compound liv@xmath7o@xmath6 has generated substantial interest in such electronic systems , which has subsequently directed us to a study@xcite of the simpler but as yet not understood properties of liti@xmath7o@xmath6,@xcite the latter of which has been suggested to be related to the high - t@xmath10 superconductors owing to strong electronic correlations.@xcite    liti@xmath7o@xmath6 undergoes a metal - to - insulator transition when excess li is doped onto the ti ( corner - sharing tetrahedral ) sublattice , or when al ( or cr , which is not discussed in this paper ) is substituted for ti on the same sublattice , and due to the large difference in on - site energies ( _ e.g. _ , doped li versus ti ) this system is well approximated by a quantum site percolation model in which the removed sites are those ti sites onto which either an excess li or substituting al ion are added .",
    "recently , two of the present authors and johnston@xcite have examined the possibility that such a model accounts for the metal - to - insulator transition , and found that physics beyond that contained in a quantum site percolation model will be required .",
    "one example candidate for this  extra physics \" can be understood as follows : the excess li or substitutional al impurity ions will generate a distribution of on - site energies around them due to their impurity potentials , so that in addition to their presence eliminating those sites from the conducting path , their effect on the neighbouring sites should also be included . as suggested by anderson,@xcite the role played by such physics",
    "is approximated by a random set of on - site energies .",
    "here we focus on one simple variant of such random energies , _ viz . _",
    "that given by a uniform ( box ) distribution , and at the end of this paper we discuss the effect of such randomness on this metal - to - insulator transition .",
    "we stress , however , that in any systematic study of the physics involving itinerant electrons encountered on a disordered cstl could require the information contained in our paper . for example , in addition to our own work,@xcite there are now several papers by fujimoto@xcite and others@xcite on the physics of correlated electrons on this lattice , and if such work is extended to disordered systems , possessing an understanding of the disordered but uncorrelated electrons would be beneficial .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in  ii we present the model that we study , and in  iii we state the numerical procedures that we use , and the statistical quantities that we evaluate . in ",
    "iv we give our comprehensive numerical results for the mobility edge trajectories and the critical disorder , and  v we present our results for the quantum - site percolation model plus anderson disorder that is meant to mimic the ( non - interacting ) model of the metal - to - insulator transition in liti@xmath7o@xmath6 .",
    "finally , in  vi we state our conclusions .",
    "in an effort to better understand the physics of electrons moving on this structure , we calculate numerically the mobility edge trajectories in the energy - disorder plane of a cstl with a tight - binding hamiltonian with a uniform ( box ) distribution model of disorder ( described below ) . in these calculations",
    "only near - neighbour hoppings are included , system sizes up to 43,904 sites have been investigated , and periodic boundary conditions have been used .",
    "the cstl under consideration is quite complicated : there are two formula units per primitive unit cell , the conventional unit cell is that of an fcc lattice , and each formula unit has two octahedral site ti atoms . that is , each conventional unit cell has 16 sites .",
    "for this reason the oft - used transfer matrix method@xcite is awkward to implement , and we have instead diagonalized the hamiltonian matrix for a lattice with @xmath11 conventional unit cells .    the hamiltonian for this system is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 denote the sites of the lattice , @xmath14 implies that @xmath15 and @xmath16 are near neighbours , and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) is the destruction ( number ) operator for an electron at site @xmath15 and spin @xmath19 .",
    "the hopping energy is @xmath20 , and the on - site energy at site @xmath15 is given by @xmath21 . for a uniform ( box )",
    "distribution of disorder the on - site energies are being chosen at random to be in the range @xmath22 to @xmath23 , with all energies in this range having the same probability .",
    "our objective is to analyze this model and determine the energy ranges over which the eigenstates are localized and extended  the trajectory in ( @xmath0,energy ) space defines the mobility edge trajectories .",
    "further , when @xmath0 is increased the upper and lower mobility edges will merge , thus identifying the critical disorder ; this quantity is denoted by @xmath1 ( or , more precisely , @xmath24 in dimensionless units ) , and we have determined this quantity using several different techniques .",
    "it seems reasonable that one could be guided , in part , by the extensive studies of this transition for the 3d simple cubic lattice ; however , there are some important differences that make this system considerably more difficult to work with .",
    "firstly , the energy spectrum of the simple cubic lattice is symmetric about zero energy , and since the upper and lower mobility edges merge at the transition indicated by @xmath1 , one may examine an energy window around zero ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , fig . 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite for an example density of states for such a problem ) .",
    "further , since the mobility edge is remarkably flat in the immediate region of @xmath1 , one can improve their statistics by looking at a reasonably large window of energy around zero ( see , _ e.g. _ , fig . 1 of ref . @xcite and the discussion in ref .",
    "however , this is not the case for a cstl  the spectrum is not symmetric about some middle energy ( apart from the limit of infinite disorder , which is pathological and of no assistance in our numerics ) , and thus the search for the critical disorder ( at which the mobility edges merge ) is more problematic . as an example of this , note that in studies of the mobility edge trajectories for quantum site percolation models , the simple cubic lattice behaves somewhat similarly to the box distribution s result discussed above ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , whereas for the cstl two of us and johnston @xcite found that the trajectory was not flat , instead depending strongly on disorder ( which for a quantum site percolation model is the fraction on unoccupied sites ) . indeed , in the results presented below , we will show that ( i ) the mobility edges meet at an energy around @xmath25 , whereas the middle of the band ( for this @xmath0 ) is at an energy of @xmath26 , and ( ii ) the mobility edges do depend on disorder quite strongly , and the upper and lower mobility edges are not obviously related to one another . in part for these reasons , the identification of the mobility edge trajectories and @xmath1 is somewhat more challenging for a cstl .",
    "in order to distinguish between localized and extended eigenstates we have used several techniques .",
    "firstly , we have calculated the localization length of an eigenstate@xcite in the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the probability amplitude for the eigenstate , of a given fixed energy , at site @xmath15 , and @xmath29 is the euclidean distance between lattice sites @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "then , this quantity is averaged for all energy eigenstates in a chosen energy range .",
    "the ratio of this parameter to the identically defined localization length of an eigenstate with constant amplitude over the entire lattice , the latter denoted by @xmath30 , is referred to as the relative localization length ; the ratio is thus denoted by @xmath31 .",
    "the behaviour of this relative localization length as a function of increasing lattice size ( for an specific energy range in the spectrum of the system ) indicates whether these eigenstates , in the thermodynamic limit , will have localized or delocalized character .",
    "that is , if this parameter increases with the system size ( having a limiting ratio of one ) , those states are extended , while if this quantity decreases with system size those eigenstates are localized .",
    "this statistic was employed in the identification of the mobility edges and metal - to - insulator transition in a quantum site percolation model of a cstl.@xcite    the above - described statistics require the determination of the eigenvectors of the hamiltonian , which is numerically more demanding than the determination of the eigenvalues alone .",
    "the most commonly employed statistic for analyzing the eigenvalues is so - called level statistics.@xcite however , we have found@xcite that the most sensitive indication of , in particular , @xmath24 is the so - called dyson - mehta @xmath32  spectral rigidity \" , which is described in detail in a variety of references  see , _ e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite .",

    "this statistic will be invariant with system size , whereas above and below this value of @xmath0 it will flow to so - called poissonian and gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( hereafter referred to as goe ) limits corresponding to localized and extended states , respectively .",
    "the utility of this statistic can be noted in its success in identifying @xmath24 for a variety of models and lattices  an example for this model of disorder for the isotropic 3d simple cubic lattice is discussed in ref.,@xcite and for the anisotropic 3d simple cubic lattice in refs.@xcite many details of the algorithm that is employed calculating this statistic , including the application of this methodology to the study of other problems , are given in refs.@xcite    we performed these calculations for system sizes up to 16,000 sites when the eigenvectors were required , and for sizes up to 43,904 sites when only the eigenvalues were evaluated . in a small number of instances we evaluated the eigenvectors for system sizes up to 27,648 , and found that our predictions based on smaller lattices did not change when these results were included .",
    "we constructed the complete anderson disordered hamiltonians for cstls with different realizations of box disorder ( random diagonal elements between @xmath22 and @xmath36 ) , using periodic boundary conditions , and these have been diagonalized . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos_acstl ] we show some representative density of states ( dos ) , including the same quantity for an ordered lattice .",
    "the data for disordered systems correspond to a system size of 21,296 sites averaged over 50 realizations of disorder .",
    "the disorder strengths correspond to below , equal to , and above the critical disorder ( discussed below ) .",
    "the evolution of the dos from the ordered to the disordered systems show that the zero of the dos at an energy of @xmath37 ( for the ordered lattice ) becomes a small dip at much lower energies , but this dip is not associated with the lower mobility edge  to be concrete , at the critical disorder this dip is present but the upper and lower mobility edges have merged ( as we show below , they merge at an energy around @xmath25 ) . at high disorder ,",
    "as expected , the dos is approximately symmetric around an energy of zero .",
    "lastly , the band edges are qualitatively similar to those predicted in analytical calculations.@xcite    clearly , when the disorder strength is not large ( relative to @xmath1 ) the density of states is not symmetric about some  middle \" energy , and to clarify previous comments we note that this necessitates that a search for the mobility edges must include a broad band of energies in the spectrum . in fact , as we discuss below , we find that the mobility edges merge at an energy around @xmath25 , which is not that close to the middle of the band for @xmath38 ( as seen in the figure , this middle is around @xmath26 ) . only in the very large @xmath39 limit",

    "<S> we then discuss our results in the context of the metal - to - insulator transition undergone by lial@xmath4ti@xmath5o@xmath6  in a quantum site percolation model that also includes the above - mentioned anderson disorder . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the effects of an inhomogeneous distribution of on - site energies produced by the al impurity potentials are small compared to those produced by quantum site percolation , at least in the determination of the doping concentration at which the metal - to - insulator transition is predicted to occur . </S>"
