    "the purpose of this paper is to complete and extend @xcite by considering the remaining two families of special functions and their properties , namely the generalizations of sine functions of two variables , which are either symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to permutations of their two variables .",
    "they are denoted here by @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the functions are of independent interest .",
    "the paper @xcite is devoted to the study of 2-dimensional symmetric and antisymmetric generalizations of the common exponential and cosine functions , namely @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    in @xcite",
    ", the functions denoted @xmath10 and @xmath11 were introduced for any number of real variables , and their properties were studied .",
    "thus , the functions @xmath9 of @xcite , as well as the functions @xmath12 considered here , are the functions of @xcite specialized to @xmath13 .",
    "standard trigonometric fourier decompositions of functions ( continuous or discrete ) of two variables @xcite use special functions formed as products of two trigonometric functions , each depending on one variable .",
    "the variables are measured along two orthogonal axes .",
    "the approach undertaken in @xcite , and extended here , appears to be the only @xmath13 ` trigonometric ' alternative to the standard approach in the literature .",
    "our expansion functions are also built as products of two trigonometric functions , but the two variables are intertwined within each trigonometric function , so that no substitution of variables can bring it to the form used in the standard approach .",
    "restriction of the functions of @xcite to two variables allows us to be more specific about the details of their properties , most notable being their discretization and orthogonality , continuous and discrete .",
    "in particular , analogs of the four types of standard cosine transforms @xcite , developed in @xcite and in here , would not be possible without specific description of discrete domains of orthogonality of the expansion functions applicable in the four cases .",
    "decomposition of all products of pairs of functions into their sums is described here .",
    "it was not considered elsewhere .",
    "there are three types of products of sine functions , @xmath14  @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , with the same arguments @xmath17 . for completeness",
    ", we also decompose all products @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "the general structure of decompositions of products is rather interesting .",
    "it is summarized symbolically in table  [ products ] .",
    ".structure of the ten types of products decomposed in the paper .",
    "the second row shows the functions appearing in all the terms of a decomposition . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]        the top left entry of the table identifies the line where the decomposition of products of the form @xmath20 is given . for our example",
    ", we selected @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "the second column entry on the same line indicates that all terms of the decomposition are the functions @xmath23 .",
    "the subsequent eight entries on that line refer to individual terms of the decomposition .",
    "each term has a coefficient @xmath24 .",
    "the actual sign of a term is shown on the line .",
    "the value of @xmath25 and @xmath26 is identified on the two top lines of the column .",
    "thus for the first term of the example we find at the top line that @xmath27 and @xmath28 . which of the two signs is applicable in @xmath25 and @xmath26 is specified at the head of the column of the first term as @xmath29 , so that @xmath30 .",
    "subsequent terms are identified in a similar way .",
    "the symbol @xmath31 is omitted to simplify the expression . from",
    "follows the presence of the coefficient 4 multiplying each product below .    in this way , some of the subscripts of the terms of the decomposition are negative . a convenient convention is to label the terms by non - negative subscripts .",
    "therefore the symmetries of the functions need to be used in order to write the subscripts as positive . if a subscript of a term @xmath32 should be 0 , the sine term vanishes .",
    "the four specific examples illustrate the decompositions :    @xmath33    @xmath34    @xmath35    @xmath36",
    "the four versions of the discrete sine transforms introduced here use a grid of points @xmath37  @xcite , extending over finite regions that differ by their boundaries .",
    "the grid is defined by the numbers @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "the number of points of the grid is @xmath41 , constant @xmath42 $ ] is the displacement of lattice points from their original position , and @xmath39 determines argument of sine functions , so that the argument is equal to @xmath43 . to make the distinctions between the four versions of the antisymmetric and symmetric transforms easy to compare",
