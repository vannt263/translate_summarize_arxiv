    "here we summarize a study ( hammer et al , 2004 , hereafter h04 ) which is based on a considerable amount of observations made using hst , iso , vla and vlt .",
    "it targets @xmath1 200 galaxies ( 0.4@xmath2 z @xmath21 ) , mostly from the sample of the canada france redshift survey ( cfrs ) .",
    "cfrs is essentially complete up to z@xmath1 1 , encompassing all luminous ( @xmath3 < - 20 ) galaxies with stellar mass ranging from 3 to 30 @xmath4 @xmath5 -hereafter called intermediate mass galaxies .",
    "those account for 65% to 80% of the present - day stellar mass ( brinchman and ellis , 2000 ; heavens et al , 2004 ) .",
    "our goals were to collect significative evolutionary features since z=1 , by combining : + 1- robust estimates of extinction , star and effective formation rates ( sfrs and sfr/@xmath6 ) and o / h abundances at z@xmath1 0.7 .",
    "those quantities have been derived after a detailed comparison of mid - ir and extinction corrected balmer emission lines fluxes which provides consistent sfr estimates within a factor 2 ( flores et al , 2004 ; liang et al , 2004a ) .",
    "notice that balmer emission lines have been properly corrected from the underlying absorption ( based on high s / n spectra at moderate resolution , see liang et al , 2004b ) .",
    "notice also that oii or uv fluxes underestimates sfr by factors averaging to 5 to 22 for starbursts and lirgs , respectively .",
    "2- a simplified morphological classification ( see zheng et al , 2004 ) which account for e / s0 and spirals as single classes , while another class is assessed to objects barely resolved by the hst ( @xmath7 3.5 @xmath8kpc luminous compact galaxies , hereafter called lcgs ) .",
    "our method , also based on color maps , considerably limits the uncertainties related to cosmological dimming , spatial resolution and morphological k - correction .",
    "it allows a fair comparison with morphological classification ( derived at the same rest - frame wavelengths ) of local galaxies in the same mass range ( nakamura et al , 2004 ) .",
    "h04 found that @xmath1 15% of intermediate mass galaxies at z@xmath9 0.4 are indeed luminous ir galaxies ( lirgs ) , a phenomenon far more common than in the local universe .",
    "this is confirmed by preliminar spitzer results ( yan et al , this volume ) . the high occurrence of lirgs",
    "is easily understood only if they correspond to episodic peaks of star formation , during which galaxies are reddened through short ires ( infrared episodes ) .",
    "we estimate that each galaxy should experience 4 to 5 @xmath10 @xmath11 ires from z=1 to z=0.4 .",
    "the star formation in lirgs is sufficient in itself to produce 38% of the total stellar mass of intermediate mass galaxies and then to account for most of the reported stellar mass formation since z=1 .",
    "this is not surprising since integrations of the cosmic star formation rate density , _ if and only if they account for ir emission _",
    "( flores et al . , 1999 ; elbaz and cesarsky , 2003 ) , match well the evolution of the global stellar mass density since z=1 ( e.g. dickinson et al .",
    "2003 ; heavens et al , 2004 ) .",
    "it can be considered robust that 45@xmath015% of the mass locked in present - day stars actually condensed in stars at @xmath12 .",
    "it is further supported by the luminosity - metallicity relation of z@xmath1 0.7 emission line galaxies , which is found to be on average , metal deficient by a factor of @xmath1 2 when compared to those of local spirals ( liang et al , 2004a , h04).a star formation history with short infrared episodes for most galaxies at intermediate redshifts is consistent with a hierarchical galaxy formation scenario .",
    "observations of lirg morphologies are then revealing us the physical processes which are responsible of most of the stellar mass production since z=1 .",
    "irregulars , major mergers and compact galaxies represent together about a third of the z@xmath10.7 galaxy population and they almost disappear today ( see table 1 and also lilly et al , 1998 ) .",
    "most of the star formation has occurred in them since they represent almost two - third of z@xmath10.7 lirgs ( table 1 ) .",
    "we assume in the following that violent infra - red episodes are responsible of most morphological changes , which links in a simple way distant galaxies to those of the present - day hubble sequence . which present day galaxy types are related to both morphological changes and episodic violent star formation events ?",
    "it can not be present - day ellipticals because : ( 1 ) no lirgs show an e / s0 morphology ; ( 2 ) if the fate of all lcgs ( or all lirgs ) were to become ellipticals , the density of present - day ellipticals would be much larger than observed ( see table 1 ) .",
    "it leads h04 to assume that most of the recent star formation has occurred in progenitors of the numerous present - day spirals ( see also wolf et al , 2004 ) .",
    "this is further supported by zheng et al ( 2004a , b ) who show that most z@xmath1 0.7 spirals have blue cores ( see also ellis et al , 2001 ) .",
    ".from h04 : morphological classification statistics for intermediate mass galaxies ; z @xmath1 0.7 galaxies are compared to those of the sdss ( nakamura et al , 2004 ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]      0.7 galaxies illustrating the rebuilding scenario ; ( 1 & 2 ) : interaction and merging , ( 3 & 4 ) : post - merger prior to the disk re - building and ( 5 ) : disk growth .",
    "( middle ) : the star formation history derived by hydrodynamical simulations of a major merger ( from tissera et al , 2002 ) which shows the corresponding phases.75@xmath025% of present - day spirals have likely experienced this sequence since z=1.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]",
    "the fraction of major mergers is evolving rapidly ( table 1 ; see also conselice et al , 2004 ) .",
    "major mergers in our sample are showing two well identified nuclei separated by less than a galactic radius ( zheng et al , 2004a , b ) .",
    "post mergers are naturally expected to show compact morphologies , and we assume in the following that lcgs are merger remnants . indeed this was firstly claimed by hammer et al ( 2001 ) on the basis of their detailed spectral properties .",
    "moreover , ostlin et al ( 2001 ) argued that their local counterparts are merger remnants on the basis of their velocity fields which are non rotationally supported .",
    "because pair counts evolve very rapidly , the fraction of intermediate mass galaxies experiencing a major merger event since z=1 is estimated to be 0.75 on the basis of bundy et al ( 2004 ) , a value lower than what was found by le fvre et al ( 2000 ) .",
    "we then develop a scenario for which most spirals have been rebuilt during the last 8 gyrs ( figure 1 ) .",
    "h04 find that assuming the characteristic time for each phases ( major mergers , compact and spirals ) from hydrodynamical models ( tissera et al , 2004 ; see also cox et al , 2004 ) , one is able to reproduce the observed fraction of each species if 75@xmath025% of spirals were rebuilt since z=1 .",
    "this simple scenario is consistent with 8 robust evolutionary features , namely the evolution of the global stellar mass , the l - z diagram , the pair statistics , the ir light density , the spiral core colours , the number density of e / s0 , spirals , and peculiar galaxies ( mergers and compact).a scenario showing no significant star formation in intermediate mass galaxies ( cowie et al , 1996 ; brinchman & ellis , 2000 ) is inconsistent with 6 of these evolutionary features ( stellar mass , l - z , pair statistics , ir light density , spiral core colours and number density of peculiar galaxies ) .",
    "a scenario for which the stellar mass formation is dominated by minor encounters ( `` collisional starbursts '' , somerville et al , 2001 ) , is better , but still inconsistent with 4 evolutionary features ( ir light density , number density of peculiar galaxies , spiral core colours and difficult to reconcile with pair statistics ) .",
    "in fact accounting for the ir light evolution leads to our spiral rebuilding scenario.this scenario has the advantage to be predictive and it can be tested .",
    "for example , the formation of a disk after a merger event requires that spiral progenitors have a substantially larger gas fraction than present - day spirals ( @xmath1 10 - 20% of the baryonic mass ) .",
    "the considerable amount of stars formed during ires suggests a gas content @xmath1 5 times higher in z@xmath1 0.7 galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with the reported o / h deficiency of z@xmath10.7 galaxy gaseous phases ( h04 ; liang et al , 2004a ) .",
    "an important assumption is that lcgs are merger remnants .",
    "preliminar results from puech et al ( 2004 , in preparation ) and from bershady et al ( this volume ) indicate that most lcgs have velocity fields not supported by rotation , as those studied locally by ostlin et al ( 2001 ) .",
    "a spiral rebuilding scenario is very efficient in forming large bulges including those of the numerous early type spirals ( 75% of present day spirals with intermediate masses ) .",
    "robust conclusions on the past formation history can be derived on only 2 intermediate mass galaxies , e.g. milky way and m31 .",
    "recent studies of stellar populations in the m31 halo are suggestive of a complex formation history possibly with a recent merger ( brown et al , 2003 ; rich , 2004 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the milky way shows no trace of such a recent event .",
    "it is less bulge - dominated than m31 , and we suggest that it could be part of the @xmath1 25% of galaxies which escaped a recent major merger at z @xmath2 1.ir data reveal a strikingly different history than previous studies based on optical / uv data .",
    "indeed the lirg number density increases by factors up to 35 from z=0 to z=1 ( elbaz and cesarsky , 2003 ) , i.e. it evolves much rapidly than the uv luminosity density .",
    "h04 find that the optical properties of lirgs mimic those of other galaxies , and that besides ir photometry , only detailed spectroscopic studies at moderate resolution are able to distinguish them .",
