    "the ulam sequence was first extensively computed in 1966 by muller @xcite , who gave the first 20.000 terms and predicted density 0 .",
    "the most extensive computation we had access to is due to daniel strottman @xcite , who computed the first 11.172.261 elements ( up to 150.999.995 ) .",
    "this data set shows that some of muller s predictions are not correct ( the density , for example , seems to be very stable and around 0.0739 ) . different initial values @xmath8 can give rise to more structured sequences @xcite : for some of them the sequence of consecutive differences @xmath10 is eventually periodic .",
    "it seems that this is not the case for ulam s sequence : knuth @xcite remarks that @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the sequence does not appear to follow any recognizable pattern @xcite and is quite erratic @xcite .",
    "we describe the ( accidental ) discovery of some very surprising structure .",
    "while using fourier series with ulam numbers as frequencies , we noticed a persisting signal in the noise : indeed , dilating the sequence by a factor @xmath3 and considering the sequence @xmath13 mod @xmath14 gives rise to a very regular distribution function .",
    "one surprising implication is @xmath15 the dilation factor @xmath16 seems to be a universal constant ( of which we were able to compute the first few digits ) ; given the distribution function , there is nothing special about the cosine and many similar inequalities could be derived ( we used the cosine because it is perhaps the simplest ) .",
    "if the ulam sequence had positive density , then by a classical theorem of roth @xcite it would contain many 3-arithmetic progressions . we were interested in whether the existence of progressions would have any impact on the structure of the sequence ( because , if @xmath17 is in the sequence for @xmath18 , then @xmath19 or @xmath20 is not ) .",
    "there is a well - known connection between randomness in sets and smallness of fourier coefficients and this motivated us to look at @xmath21 clearly , @xmath22 and @xmath23 and therefore we expected @xmath24 for @xmath25 outside of 0 . much to our surprise , we discovered that this is not the case and that there is an @xmath26 with that @xmath27 .",
    "such a behavior is , of course , an indicator of an embedded signal .",
    "an explicit computation with @xmath28 pinpoints the location of the signal at @xmath29 and , by symmetry , at @xmath30 .",
    "this signal acts as a hidden shift in frequency space : we can remove that shift in frequency by considering @xmath31    a priori it might be reasonable to suspect that the ulam sequence is ` pseudo - random ' ( in the same way as cramr s model suggests ` pseudo - randomness ' of the primes ) .",
    "there are some local obstructions ( for example both primes and the ulam sequence do not contain a triple @xmath32 for @xmath33 ) but it would a priori be conceivable that many statistical quantities could be predicted by a random model .",
    "our discovery clearly shows this to be false : the ulam sequence has some _ extremely _ rigid underlying structure .",
    "we are hopeful that the rigidity of the phenomenon will provide a first way to get a more rigorous understanding of the ulam sequence ; however , we also believe that the phenomenon might be related to some interesting mechanism in additive combinatorics and of independent interest .",
    "gibbs @xcite has used this phenomenon as a basis for an algorithm that allows for a faster computation of ulam numbers .",
    "jud mccranie informed me that he and gibbs have independently computed a large number of ulam numbers ( more than 2.4 billion ) and verified the existence of the phenomenon up to that order .",
    "mccranie gives the bounds @xmath34 we do not have any natural conjecture for a closed - form expression of @xmath16 .",
    "the value @xmath16 is not unique in the sense that there are other values @xmath25 such that @xmath35 however , these other values can be regarded as the effect of an underlying symmetry .",
    "sinan gntrk ( personal communication ) observed that these other values seem to be explicitly given by @xmath36 . if there is weak convergence of the empirical distribution , i.e. if @xmath37 computationally , our strategy consists of looking for nonzero values of the integral ( whose value is 0 in the generic case , where @xmath38 is a uniform distribution )",
    "this makes @xmath26 the frequency for which the phenomenon is most strongly concentrated , however , there are other peaks .",
    "it is easy to see that if we have convergence to an absolutely continuous measure @xmath39 and if @xmath40 is unevenly distributed in the sense that @xmath41 then the same relation can be expected for the new density function .",
    "there are functions @xmath42 however , the set of such functions is very small and not stable under perturbations . _",
    "generically _ , if @xmath43 is not the uniform distribution , then neither is the new distribution . in the case of the ulam sequence",
    "@xmath44 it is thus to be expected that the signals at frequency @xmath45 mod @xmath46 generated out of the initial measure ( fig.3 ) located at frequency @xmath16 are never uniformly distributed .",
    "numerically , this holds and @xmath47          macmahon s primes of measurement , sometimes called segmented numbers , are given by the sequence @xmath50 generated by excluding all sums of two or more consecutive elements of the sequence ( see guy s _ unsolved problems in number theory _",
    "* section e30 ) ) .",
    "george andrews conjectures that @xmath51 the sequence is very different from the ulam sequence but certainly similar in spirit .",
    "the cosine sum with these terms does appear to be random , however , we also remark that the publicly available data set @xcite we used only contains about 7000 terms and larger compilations may provide more insight .",
    "lagarias @xcite proposes excluding only sums of two or three consecutive earlier members ( which certainly increases the similarity to the definition of the ulam sequence ) , the arising sequence being @xmath52 we used a publicly available list of the first 10.000 elements @xcite .",
    "first of all we note a peak at @xmath53 corresponding to an uneven distribution in @xmath54 : indeed , it seems that elements of the sequence are more likely to be even than odd ( with @xmath55 of elements being even ) .",
    "the behavior away from the peak is more interesting : it seems as if @xmath56 but that the sum is experiencing smaller levels of fluctuations for small @xmath25 and larger levels for large @xmath25 .",
    "there seems to be a transition occuring somewhere around @xmath57 .",
    "the absolute value of the sum seems to be indeed of order @xmath58 and , as a consequence , plotting the distribution of @xmath59 on the torus shows essentially a uniform distribution .",
    "* acknowledgement . * the result for the ulam sequence",
    "was originally discovered using only the first @xmath60 numbers for each set of initial conditions ; the precision of the results presented here would not have been possible without the data sets compiled and generously provided by daniel strottman for all initial conditions that were discussed .",
    "sinan gntrk observed the arithmetic regularity of the location of the peaks which gave rise to section 2.3 .",
    "bruce reznick was very helpful in explaining the early history of the stern sequence .",
    "jud mccranie informed the author of additional data and performed additional tests on them providing a better estimate for @xmath61 .",
    "the computations involving the @xmath62function were carried out using oldyzko s list @xcite of the first 100.000 roots .",
    "the author is indebted to steven finch for extensive discussions and his encouragement ."
