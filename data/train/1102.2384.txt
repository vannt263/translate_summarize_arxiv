    "a different scenario is observed in the nes . instead of a discontinuity",
    "there is a continuous but quick variation of the order parameter during the transition .",

    "this model has the advantage of providing a simple way to investigate a wide range of parameters , gives a unified view of the critical behavior of nes , in general agreement with previous theoretical @xcite , numerical @xcite , and experimental findings @xcite , and suggests the occurrence of some additional phenomena . in section ii , we define the basic lattice model . the global free energy is obtained in section iii .",
