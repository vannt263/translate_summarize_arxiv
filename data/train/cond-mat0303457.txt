    "the general set - up of the ac - calorimetric technique for measuring the specific heat is sketched as a simplified model in fig .  [",

    "the sample is thermally excited by an oscillating heating power @xmath5 $ ] , e.g. generated by a current of frequency @xmath6 through a resistance heater .",
    "the temperature oscillations at frequency @xmath7 are detected with a thermometer attached to the sample .",
    "sullivan and seidel @xcite obtained a relation among the amplitude @xmath8 of the temperature oscillations and the specific heat @xmath2 of the sample : @xmath9    this equation contains the time constants @xmath10 and @xmath11 , with @xmath12 the thermal conductivity of the thermal link between sample and temperature bath ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : schema](a ) ) .",
    "it was derived in the ideal case , when the heat capacity of thermometer , heater , and heat link between sample and temperature bath are negligible and assuming a perfect coupling between heater , sample , and thermometer .",
    "the measured value of @xmath8 depends on the measuring frequency @xmath7 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schema](b ) ) : at low frequency ( @xmath13 ) the mean sample temperature is above the bath temperature @xmath14 by @xmath15 .",
    "the recorded temperature oscillation @xmath8 yields the specific heat of the sample if the frequencies are in the range @xmath16 .",
    "the possibility of tuning both the amplitude and the frequency of the excitation is the main advantage of this method ; as long as @xmath12 can be made small enough , the sensitivity of the measurement does not depend on the mass of the sample .",
    "this technique was employed by several groups @xcite to investigate the pressure dependence of the specific heat .",
    "the conditions for the ac - technique in a pressure cell are far away from being ideal .",
    "in particular the thermal properties of the pressure transmitting medium have to be taken into account .",
    "this was done by baloga and garland  @xcite for the case of high gas densities and low sample thermal conductivities . in their accessible temperature range ( 245  k  @xmath17300  k ) the general relation between @xmath8 and @xmath2 for the ac - calorimetric expression ( [ eq : tac ] )",
    "can be recovered if the product of specific heat and thermal conductivity of the pressure transmitting medium is negligible with respect to that of the sample .",
    "then the heat wave does not propagate too far into the pressure transmitting medium and its specific heat does not contribute too much to @xmath8 .",
    "typical frequencies are of the order of 1  hz .",
    "eichler and gey @xcite were the first to use the ac - technique for metallic samples in a piston - cylinder cell ( @xmath18  gpa ) at low temperature ( 1.3  k@xmath19  k ) . here",
    ", the sample was embedded in diamond powder .",
    "it acts as pressure transmitting medium and provided the thermal resistance between the sample and the pressure cell .",
    "the measuring frequency was 120  hz .",
    "pressures well above 3.5  gpa can only be achieved with opposed anvils , i.e. , with a clamped bridgman anvil technique or a diamond anvil cell ( dac ) . in bridgman cells ,",
    "the anvils are often made out of tungsten carbide ( wc ) or synthetic diamond and the pressure chamber consists of pyrophyllite ( a sheet silicate , al@xmath20si@xmath21o@xmath22(oh)@xmath20 ) .",
    "the sample is in between two disks of e.g. , the soft mineral steatite ( 3mgo@xmath234sio@xmath24h@xmath20o ) which acts as pressure transmitting medium . in a dac",
    "a metallic gasket contains the sample and the pressure transmitting medium .",
    "compared to a bridgman cell a dac comprises several advantages .",
    "first of all the pressure range can be extended easily to 50  gpa .",
    "furthermore , the transparent anvils give optical access to the sample and the pressure can be determined with the ruby fluorescence method . finally , the most important point is the possibility using he as pressure transmitting medium . with respect to hydrostatic pressure conditions ,",
    "solidified he is an ideal medium since it is highly plastic and inert .",
    "however , these desirable features might mislead in underestimating the efforts in the elaborate assembly of the ac - calorimetric circuit in a dac .",
    "the feasibility of the ac - technique at pressures well above the limit of the piston - cylinder cells has to be tested , regardless of the type of high pressure cell . from the general principle of the ac - calorimetry ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schema ] ) it is evident that the main challenge are the unknown thermal properties of the pressure transmitting medium . to shed some light on this ,",
    "the thermal conductivity of the two preferred media , steatite and he will be discussed qualitatively in the following .",
    "a priori it is not evident if the pressure media could satisfy the assumed requirements in the deduction of ( [ eq : tac ] ) because little is known about their thermal conductivity under pressure . to get an overview of @xmath25 of the materials used in a bridgman device , the thermal conductivity of wc , pyrophylitte , and steatite at ambient pressure",
    "have been measured ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kappaall ] ) .",
    "literature data of diamond @xcite and solid he at different pressure @xcite are also depicted in fig .  [ fig : kappaall ] . at low temperatures",
    "@xmath25 of steatite can be a factor 10@xmath26 smaller than that of solid he at about 0.1  gpa .",
    "moreover , the purity of he significantly affects the shape and size of @xmath25 .",
    "for very pure he @xcite the maximum thermal conductivity can be one order of magnitude higher than for unpurified he at almost the same pressure @xcite .",
    "fortunately , it is very likely that the solidified he in the pressure chamber of a dac is polycrystalline and contains impurities , brought in during the filling procedure .",
    "therefore , @xmath25 might not reach the high values expected for pure he at the same pressure . as was pointed out in @xcite",
    "the maximum value of @xmath25 occurs roughly at @xmath27 ( @xmath28 : debye temperature ) .",
    "since he is highly compressible , @xmath28 and thus , the maximum of @xmath25 , rapidly increases with pressure . as a result",
    "the value of @xmath25 at , e.g. 1  k , could decrease considerably . in order to get a rough estimate of @xmath25 of he at several gpa ,",
    "the following assumptions are made : ( i ) the low temperature slope remains unchanged at high pressure .",
    "( ii ) the maximum value of @xmath25 at @xmath29 does not increase with pressure .",
    "( iii ) @xmath30 can be estimated using @xmath31^{\\gamma}$ ] with @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "( iv ) the maximum value of @xmath25 for he in a dac might be comparable to that of impure he at about 0.1  gpa ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kappaall ] ) . based on the equation of state for solid he @xcite the density for low temperature and 2  gpa",
    "is inferred to be about @xmath33  @xmath34/mole .",
    "this density together with @xmath35  k at @xmath36  @xmath34/mole @xcite yields",
    "@xmath37  k. then @xmath25 at 2  gpa ( line in fig .",
    "[ fig : kappaall ] ) can be estimated with the assumptions specified above .",
    "@xmath25 of steatite and he shown in fig .  [ fig : kappaall ] clarifies the differences in an ac - calorimetric experiment with these pressure media .",
    "the cut - off frequency in the case of steatite changes continuously since @xmath25 is a monotonic function below 10  k. moreover , it is very likely that its shape will not be effected strongly by pressure .",
    "thus , @xmath38 at a given temperature should slightly vary with pressure .",
    "for steatite @xmath39 , with @xmath40  w / m / k@xmath41 , is a good approximation of the data below 8  k. together with heat capacity of a typical heavy fermion compound like ceru@xmath20ge@xmath20 @xcite or cepd@xmath20ge@xmath20 @xcite a cut - off frequency @xmath42  hz at ambient pressure is calculated .",
    "@xmath25 of pressurized he , however , varies drastically with temperature and pressure .",
    "comparing @xmath25 of he at 2  gpa and 4.2  k with that of steatite at ambient pressure shows that @xmath38 will be roughly a factor 10 larger and of the order of several khz . at these frequencies",
    "severe constraints are put on the homogeneity of the temperature in the sample . a homogeneous temperature distribution in the sample is given if the thermal wavelength @xmath43 is of the order of the sample thickness ( typically about 30  @xmath44 m ) .",
    "this condition is already fulfilled at about @xmath45  khz for the compounds mentioned above . nevertheless , these frequencies are well below @xmath46 since metallic samples and thermometer ensure high thermal conductivity .",
    "these considerations show that an ac - calorimetric measurement of metallic samples enclosed in solid he is more difficult for 1  k@xmath0  k as for the same sample embedded in steatite . outside this temperature interval @xmath25 of he can be as small as that of steatite at ambient pressure and it might expected that @xmath8 is dominated by the specific heat of the sample . if the assumptions made above hold for even higher pressure , the cut - off frequency could be reduced significantly and the ac - calorimetry in a dac would become feasible in a larger temperature range .",
    "the previous section illuminated the general aspects of the ac - calorimetry and contemplated the frequency domain in which experiments could be conducted . two independent experiments @xcite using the same compound but in different pressure devices and pressure transmitting media provide experimental information about the cut - off frequency .",
    "both investigations explored pressures up to 8  gpa and temperatures in the range 1.5  k@xmath0  k.    figure  [ fig : cellcrg ] shows the pressure chamber of the bridgman cell before closing the device .",
    "the typical thickness of the sample , thermocouple and heating wires are 20 , 12 , and 3  @xmath44 m , respectively .",
    "two different ways of supplying the heat to the samples were tested . for sample  a a thin electrical insulation ( 45  @xmath44 m of an epoxy / al@xmath20o@xmath47 mixture ) prevents electrical contact with the heater but still established a good thermal contact .",
    "sample b is set apart on a metallic ( pb ) foil , electrically ( and thus thermally ) linked to the heater through a gold wire .",
    "no heating current passes through this sample . in the course of the experiment it turned out that the configuration a provided a homogeneous temperature distribution whereas the configuration b was ensuring hydrostatic pressure conditions .",
    "the heating power was chosen in such a way that the temperature oscillations were in the range 2  mk@xmath48  mk .",
    "they were measured with a fe / au thermocouple ( au + 0.07  at% fe ) .",
    "the thermovoltage @xmath49 arises from the temperature difference between the sample ( at @xmath50 ) and the edge of the sample chamber ( at @xmath14 ) @xcite .",
    "the thermovoltage was amplified at room temperature in two stages and read by means of a lock - in detection referred to the frequency of the heating current .",
    "however , two potential drawbacks should not be concealed : ( i ) the temperature of the samples is measured with a thermocouple , under the assumption that the ambient pressure calibration holds at high pressure .",
    "( ii ) the total amount of heat supplied to the samples is not known , despite the resistive heating .",
    "this prevents so far the acquisition of absolute values for the specific heat .    , of ceru@xmath20ge@xmath20 enclosed in steatite at 0.7  gpa and the specific heat @xmath51 measured with a relaxation method at ambient pressure @xcite .",
    "the data sets are normalized at 10  k. a frequency test at 4.2  k is depicted in the inset ( @xmath52  hz ) .",

    "together with the well known influence of pressure on these transitions @xcite this compound is a good candidate for testing ac - calorimetry at high pressure .",
    "figure  [ fig : cp_crg](a ) shows the result of the ac - measurements at 0.7  gpa in comparison to the specific heat obtained by a relaxation method at ambient pressure .",
    "pressure slightly shifted the transition temperatures as expected from the ( @xmath54 ) phase diagram @xcite .",
    "the height of the specific heat jump at the second order transition ( @xmath55  9  k ) represents 47% of the total signal compared to 51% for the ambient pressure curve .",
    "this indicates that @xmath8 is dominated by the heat capacity of the sample . an additional support for this statement",
    "is given by a frequency test . according to ( [ eq : tac ] ) the relation @xmath56 for @xmath57 should hold , which is indeed observed ( inset fig .",
    "[ fig : cp_crg](a ) ) .",
    "a fit of a low pass filter to the data yields @xmath58  hz . frequency tests at various temperatures and pressures are a necessary task to determine @xmath38 and to ensure the validity of the relation between @xmath8 and the specific heat of the sample .",
    "the height of the first order transition ( @xmath59  7  k ) is very sensitive to any distribution of @xmath60 and should not compared to the peak in @xmath61 at ambient pressure .",
    "moreover , ac - calorimetry is not the proper tool to measure a latent heat @xcite since it only detects the reversible part at frequency @xmath7 on a temperature scale @xmath8 .",
    "nevertheless , the position of a first order transition can be detected by an ac - calorimetric measurement .",
    "the ac - calorimetry data of ceru@xmath20ge@xmath20 above 5  gpa shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cp_crg](b ) demonstrate the potential of this method .",
    "the influence of pressure on the antiferromagnetic transition is visible and the deduced @xmath62 data agree with the ( @xmath54 ) phase diagram extracted from transport measurements @xcite . a critical pressure @xmath63  gpa is necessary to suppress the long - range magnetic order .",
    "the broadening of the antiferromagnetic transition is very likely related to intrinsic effects although a small pressure inhomogeneity could be partly responsible for it .",
    "in addition to this transition an anomaly at lower temperature was resolved ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : cp_crg](b ) ) .",
    "these measurements were the first to show that this anomaly seen so far only by transport measurements @xcite , has thermodynamic origin and is a bulk property .",
    "working with a dac allowed demuer and coworkers @xcite to use a different way to supply the oscillating heat power to the sample .",
    "they attached an optical fiber to the dac and heated the sample with the light of an ar - ion laser .",
    "it was chopped mechanically at frequencies up to 3  khz .",
    "the temperature oscillations of a au - chromel thermocouple bonded directly on the sample by spark welding were measured with a lock - in amplifier . in this experiment ceru@xmath20ge@xmath20",
    "was enclosed with solidified he .",
    "the cut - off frequency was estimated to 4  khz at 0.5  gpa and 7  k. this value supports the estimated order of magnitude for @xmath38 in the case of pressurized he given in sec .  [",
    "sec : experimental ] .",
    "the high thermal conductivity of he limits the application of the ac - method at low pressures .",
    "nevertheless , the magnetic phase transitions could be observed although only a part of the signal at the fixed measuring frequency of 1.5  khz was due to the specific heat of the sample . in this investigation an increased width of the transition was also established .",
    "intrinsic effects seem to be responsible for this if the good hydrostatic pressure conditions in the experiment are kept in mind . in addition , a similar broadening in specific heat experiments at ambient and low pressure have been reported @xcite when @xmath64 is pushed to zero temperature either by doping or pressure .",
    "the analysis of the thermal conductivity data in sec .  [ sec : experimental ] suggests that he could be used as a pressure transmitting medium at low temperature even at pressures of a few gpa .",
    "this presumption is corroborated by the results of holmes and coworkers @xcite . with a combined measurement of electrical resistivity and ac - calorimetry the heavy fermion superconductor cecu@xmath20si@xmath20",
    "was investigated down to 0.1  k for pressures up to 7  gpa .",
    "the jump in the ac - signal caused by the entrance into the superconducting state provided a semi - quantitative measure of the sample specific heat .",
    "the onset of the specific heat occurred when the resistive transition was completed and affirms the bulk property of the superconducting state .",
    "a demonstration of the feasibility of the ac - technique below 1  k and pressures well above 10  gpa is the experiment on cepd@xmath65ge@xmath66 in a bridgman - type of pressure cell @xcite .",
    "the set - up of the experiment was chosen in such a way that electrical resistivity and ac - calorimetry could be performed on the same crystal .",
    "this makes it possible to check whether an anomaly in @xmath67 is related to the sample or not with an independent electrical resistivity measurement .",
    "figure  [ fig : cpgcell ] shows the arrangement in the pressure chamber .",
    "it contains two different samples of the solid - solution cepd@xmath68ge@xmath69 , but only one of them ( @xmath70 ) was connected for the ac - experiment .",
    "the sample was heated with a current supplied through au - wires attached to the sample .",
    "this reduces the components in the pressure chamber and avoids a pressure gradient due to the heat wires . with this arrangement",
    "it is also possible to calibrate the fe / au thermocouple up to very high pressure and over a wide temperature range @xcite .",
    "it was observed that the absolute thermopower @xmath71 of fe at 4.2  k and 1.0  k at 12  gpa is about 20% smaller than the values at ambient pressure .",
    "these rather small changes show that the results are not affected qualitatively if the ambient pressure values of @xmath71 are used .",
    "thus , the drawback of a missing temperature calibration for the thermocouple mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : pressuremedia ] could be in principle eliminated .",
    "the reliability of the pressure cell is obvious as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : cpgcell ] . after the pressure was released from 22  gpa the overall shape of the pressure cell as well as its initial diameter",
    "were almost unchanged and the distance between the voltage leads increased by less than 5% .",
    "cepd@xmath65ge@xmath66 was chosen because in its stoichiometric form it is the ge - doped counterpart of the antiferromagnetically ordered heavy fermion compound cepd@xmath20si@xmath20 ( @xmath72  k ) .",
    "the latter system enters a superconducting ground state when the magnetic order is suppressed ( @xmath73  gpa ) @xcite .",
    "applying pressure to cepd@xmath65ge@xmath66 ( @xmath74  k @xcite ) should increase @xmath64 to a maximum and then it should approach zero temperature .",
    "the aim of the ac - calorimetric measurement was to extract the electronic contribution to the specific heat .",
    "figure  [ fig : cp_cpg ] shows the inverse of the registered lock - in signal @xmath49 below 10 k at various pressures .",
    "the pronounced anomaly in @xmath75 for pressures between 6.0 gpa and 10 gpa is caused by the entrance into the antiferromagnetically ordered phase .",
    "the height of the anomaly decreases and it becomes a very broad feature as the system approaches @xmath76  gpa @xcite .",
    "a similar broadening upon approaching the critical pressure was reported for cepd@xmath20si@xmath20 , despite the lower pressure and the use of he as pressure transmitting medium @xcite .",
    "recalling the increased transition width reported in sec .",
    "[ sec : pressuremedia ] it is very likely that this is an intrinsic phenomenon .",
    "two frequency tests at @xmath77  gpa are shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : cp_cpg ] . a fit of a low pass filter to the data yield cut - off frequencies of @xmath78  hz and 1060  hz for @xmath79  k and 9  k , respectively . assuming the validity of @xmath80 , these values and the @xmath81 data at the corresponding temperatures result in @xmath82  k)/@xmath83  k)@xmath84 , almost the same ratio as at ambient pressure ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : kappaall ] ) .",
    "hence , pressures up to 9  gpa seem to have a weak effect on @xmath25 of steatite below 10  k.    the most important observation in this experiment is the pressure dependence of the value of @xmath85 taken at about 0.3  k. the inverse of the lock - in voltage , @xmath81 , strongly increases , reaches a maximum in the vicinity of @xmath86 and levels off at high pressure ( fig .  [ fig : gamma ] ) .",
    "the critical pressure was inferred from the @xmath87-anomaly in the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity @xmath88 , with @xmath89 the residual resistivity , and the fitting parameters @xmath90 and @xmath91 @xcite . below 1  k",
    ", @xmath81 is proportional to @xmath51 , since the temperature dependence of the absolute thermopower , @xmath92 , is a fairly good assumption . above this temperature",
    "the @xmath71 dependence is certainly different and @xmath85 has to be interpreted with caution .",
    "thus , @xmath75 at low temperature can be regarded as a direct measure of the electronic correlations .",
    "the pronounced pressure dependence of @xmath85 shows that the electronic correlations are considerably enhanced as pressure approaches @xmath86 and that the signal originates mainly from the sample .",
    "however , above 15  gpa , the pressure dependence is not strong enough to follow the @xmath87-dependence according to the empirical kadowaki - woods relation @xcite . a possible reason for this deviation might be that at these pressures @xmath93 does not represent entirely the heat capacity of the sample .",
    "a step towards a quantitative measure of the specific heat at these conditions would be to achieve a control of the supplied heating power and the thermal contact between sample and pressure transmitting medium .",
    "nevertheless , the strong pressure dependence of @xmath85 at low temperature is reminiscent to @xmath87 and is a motivation for further studies .",
    "the ac - calorimetric technique adapted for high pressure experiments at low temperature ( @xmath94  k ) was discussed .",
    "the oscillating sample temperature provides the specific heat of the sample if the measuring frequency is above the cut - off frequency @xmath80 .",
    "it is determined by the thermal conductivity of the pressure transmitting medium and the specific heat of the sample . a qualitative estimate of @xmath25 for steatite and solid he , the two preferred pressure media was made .",
    "the cut - off frequency for steatite is less than 1  khz whereas several khz was inferred for solid he ( at @xmath95  gpa and 4.2  k ) .",
    "an experimental confirmation of the order of magnitude for these values was found for pressures up to 7  gpa and temperatures in the range of 1.5  k@xmath0  k. the large values in the case of he put a temperature limit for the use of a dac whereas a bridgman - type of high pressure cell can be used below 10  k and pressures well above 10  gpa . due to the strong pressure dependence of @xmath25 of he , the maximum in @xmath25 shifts towards higher temperature .",
    "this might open the low temperature region for the ac - calorimetric method also for a dac .",
    "these promising results build up the hope of a quantitative understanding of the ac - calorimetry and interesting specific heat data under extreme conditions might be expected . +",
