    "in the last few years it has become apparent that quantum information may lead to further insight into other areas of physics such as condensed matter and statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "the attention of the quantum information community to study in condensed matter has stimulated an exciting cross fertilization between the two areas .",
    "it has been found that entanglement plays a crucial role in the low - temperature physics of many of these systems , particularly in their ground state@xcite .",
    "quantum phase transition ( qpt ) happens at zero temperature and shown non analyticity in the physical properties of the ground state by the change of a parameter @xmath2 of the hamiltonian @xmath3 .",
    "this change is driven only by quantum fluctuations@xcite .",
    "since qpt occurs at @xmath4 , the emerging correlations have a purely quantum origin .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to conjecture that entanglement is a crucial ingredient for the occurrence of the qpt @xcite .",
    "@xcite have shown that a discontinuity in a bipartite entanglement measure ( concurrence@xcite and negativity @xcite ) is a necessary and sufficient indicator of a first - order quantum phase transition , negativity being characterized by a discontinuity in the first derivative of the ground state energy .",
    "they have also shown that a discontinuity or a divergence in the first derivative of the same measure ( assuming it is continuous ) is a necessary and sufficient indicator of a second - order qpt , that is characterized by a discontinuity or a divergence of the second derivative of the ground state energy .",
    "dzyaloshinsky has shwon@xcite that , in crystal with no inversion center , the usual isotropic exchange @xmath5 is not the only magnetic interaction and antisymmetric exchange @xmath6 is allowed .",
    "later , moriya has shown@xcitethat inclusion of spin orbit coupling on magnetic ions in 1st and 2nd order leads to antisymmetric and anisotropic exchange respectively .",
    "this interaction is , however , rather difficult to handle analytically , but it is one of the agents responsible for magnetic frustration . since this interaction may induce spiral spin arrangements in the ground state@xcite , it is closely involved with ferroelectricity in multiferroic spin chains@xcite . besides , the dm interaction plays an important role in explaining the electron spin resonance experiments in some one - dimensional antiferromagnets@xcite .",
    "moreover , the dm interaction modifies the dynamic properties@xcite and quantum entanglement@xcite of spin chains@xcite . in the present paper , we are interested to study the one - dimensional spin-1/2 ising model with added dm interaction from quantum entanglement point of view using variational matrix product state and numerical exact diagonalization methods .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is spin-@xmath9 operator on the @xmath10-th site , and @xmath11 @xmath12 denotes antiferromagnetic ( ferromagnetic ) coupling constant . in very recent",
    "works@xcite respectively studied the ground state phase diagram of the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ising chain in the presence of the uniform dm interaction .",
    "it is found that the ground state phase diagram of both systems consists of spiral - ferromagnetic and spiral - antiferromagnetic phases respectively and a commensurate - incommensurate ( c - ic ) quantum phase transition occurs at @xmath13 .",
    "however at the critical value @xmath14 , a metamagnetic phase transition occurs into the chiral gapless phase in the ground state phase diagram of the ferromagnetic chain .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii , we will discuss about bipartite and multipartite entanglement measures as qpt indicators of our model and we will present our numerical study . in section iii , the variational matrix product states will be outlined and bipartite entanglement will be obtained . in section iv , we willstudy entanglement of three qubits in symmetric and antisymmetric way . finally we conclude and summarize our results in section v.",
    "the occurrence of collective behavior in many - body quantum systems is associated with classical and quantum correlation .",
    "the quantum correlation , which known as entanglement , can not be measured in terms of classical physics and represents the impossibility of giving a local description of many - body quantum state .",
    "the issue of finding entanglement measures has recently attracted an increasing interest@xcite .",
    "concurrence and tangle are the most widely used measures in qpt related entanglement studies .",
    "both of these measures are for bipartite states and because of monogamous nature of entanglement they are expected to decrease at the quantum critical point , if entanglement is shared by the whole system .",
    "therefore , in order to manifest the presence of ( qpt ) in the model described by eq.([ising ] ) , we focus on the entanglement of formation @xcite in the quantum spin system and make use of the _ one - tangle _ and of the concurrence .",
    "the one - tangle @xcite quantifies the zero temperature entanglement of a single spin with the rest of the system and defines as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the one - site reduced density matrix , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 . in terms of the spin expectation values @xmath19 , one has : @xmath20 on other hand , the concurrence@xcite quantifies instead the pairwise entanglement between two spins and defines as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the correlation function between spins on sites @xmath24 and @xmath25 and @xmath26 . the notation @xmath27 represents the ground state expectation value .    , ( a ) ferromagnetic and ( b ) antiferromagnetic cases for different lengths n=12 , 16 , 20 , 24.,title=\"fig:\",width=377,height=302 ] + , ( a ) ferromagnetic and ( b ) antiferromagnetic cases for different lengths n=12 , 16 , 20 , 24.,title=\"fig:\",width=377,height=302 ] +    one - tangle and concurrence are related by coffman - kundu - wootters ( ckw ) conjecture @xcite , which had been proved by osborne and verstraete @xcite , stating that @xmath28 which expresses the crucial fact that pairwise entanglement does not exhaust the global entanglement of the system , as entanglement can also be stored in 3-spin correlations , 4-spin correlations , and so on .",
    "authors in ref.(@xcite ) , have proposed that , due to ckw conjecture , the minimum of the entanglement ratio @xmath1 , as a novel estimator of qpt , fully based on entanglement quantifiers .    by doing an experiment , one can find a clear picture of the entanglement phenomenon in the ground state magnetic phases of the model . since a real experiment",
    "can not be done at zero temperature , the best way is doing a virtual numerical experiment . a very famous and accurate method in the field of the numerical experiments",
    "is known as the lanczos method .",
    "however , the strong role of a numerical experiment to examine quantum phase transitions is not negligible . to explore the nature of the entanglement in different magnetic phases",
    ", we used lanczos method to diagonalize numerically chains with length up to @xmath29 and coupling constant @xmath30 .",
    "the ground state eigenvector , @xmath31 , was obtained for chains with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the numerical lanczos results on the concurrence for the ising chain with dm interaction , are shown in fig .",
    "[ c - f ] . as is clearly seen from fig .",
    "[ c - f](a ) , in the case of ferromagnetic chain and for @xmath32 , the concurrence is equal to zero which shows that the ground state of the system is in the fully non - entangled polarized ferromagnetic phase . at the critical value @xmath33 , the concurrence jumps to a non - zero value which confirms the metamagnetic phase transition . by more increasing the dm vector , @xmath34 ,",
    "the ground state is in the chiral phase and nearest neighbors are entangled . on the other hand , in the case of the antiferromagnetic ising model , as can be clearly seen from fig .",
    "[ c - f](b ) , in the absence of the dm interaction , the ground state is non - entangled which is related to the saturated n@xmath35el phase .",
    "as soon as the dm vector applies , nearest neighbors will be entangled and concurrence between them increases from zero .",
    "thus in the case of antiferromagnetic ising chains , the dm interaction induces the quantum correlations of the two spins and nearest neighbor spins will be entangled as soon as the dm interaction applies . in contrast , in the case of the ferromagnetic ising chains the dm interaction only induces the quantum correlations after the critical value @xmath14 and nearest neighbor spins will not be entangled up to the critical value @xmath14 .",
    "an additional insight into the nature of different phases can be obtained by studying the entanglement ratio .",
    "therefore , we have calculated the entanglement ratio by using lanczos method in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cases .",
