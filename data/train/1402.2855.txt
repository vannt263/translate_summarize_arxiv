    "agrees with the location of the four peaks in @xmath150 seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf_theta ] at this @xmath1 .",
    "the jamming transition thus appears to be accompanied by a vanishing of nematic ordering and the increase in tetratic ordering .",
    "as might be expected , sensitivity to the strain rate @xmath50 sets in near the jamming transition , showing a slight shift of the transition from nematic to tetratic ordering to higher @xmath1 as @xmath50 decreases .    to see whether or not the orientational ordering is a consequence of interaction induced collective behavior , we now consider the orientational ordering correlation functions , @xmath186 where @xmath187 denotes the orientation angle of a particle at position @xmath34 .",

    "the interactions with the other particles act like a disordering noise that reduces the effect of the strain ordering field and causes @xmath168 to decrease .",
    "the growth in tetratic order above jamming would appear to be an interaction effect , but of only a local nature .      for more insight into the reason that orientational ordering generally decreases as @xmath1 increases , we look at the average angular velocity , @xmath201 .",

    "this increase in @xmath205 as @xmath1 increases is in stark contrast to the behavior of frictionless rod shaped particles , where we have found that @xmath205 monotonically _ decreases _ as @xmath1 increases @xcite .    in fig .",

    "[ fig : angular_velocity ] .",
    "thus , as might be expected , the magnitude of the contribution of @xmath225 to the rotation is related to the degree of anisotropy of contacts .",
    "we find that the eigenvector associated with eigenvalue @xmath224 is oriented with an angle near @xmath226 for all packing fractions , which means that the points of contact tend to be located in the upper - left or lower - right quadrants of the staples .",
    "for a dilute system we can make sense of this by realizing that most new contacts will be made in these quadrants due to the shear flow @xmath227 . while the torque generated by such a contact depends on the orientation of the staple , more often than not it will tend to increase rotation .",
    "we note that near and above the jamming transition the anisotropy @xmath223 depends on the shear rate @xmath50 , while the rotation @xmath205 does not .",

    "we have studied the jamming transition in a system of concave , frictionless , u - shaped particles under both compression and steady - state shearing . for our particular particles , we have found that the jamming transition upon compressing is clearly associated with isostaticity , and occurs at values of @xmath239 between 0.49 and 0.5 depending on the initial packing fraction from which the compression begins . in steady - state shearing",
    "our results suggested a lower bound for the jamming transition to be @xmath240 .",
    "several features we have observed , that ( i ) compression - driven jamming occurs at the isostatic point , that ( ii ) compression - driven jamming is influenced by the ensemble of initial states from which the compression begins , that ( iii ) shear - driven jamming occurs at a higher packing fraction than found from compressing dilute systems , and that ( iv ) there is a diverging translational correlation length as the shear driven jamming transition is approached , are all in common with the behavior observed for the jamming of frictionless disks .",
    "the main new effects that we have observed are : ( i ) the time required to reach steady - state , independent of the initial configuration , in shear driven flow is very much longer than for disks .",
    "( ii ) the asymmetric shape of our particles leads to a non - uniform tumbling motion under shear flow , with corresponding nematic and tetratic orientational order ; however , we find that the orientational ordering in general decreases as the jamming transition is approached from below , and the average angular velocity of the particles increases .",
    "this is opposite to what we have observed in sheared frictionless rods @xcite , where orientational order increases and angular velocity decreases as density increases .",
    "it is natural to attribute both of these effects ( i ) and ( ii ) to the concave particle shape of our staples and the resulting geometric cohesion , however further work remains to be done to more firmly establish the effect of particle shape on orientational ordering and angular velocity .",
    "finally , we have also found ( iii ) that the nematic ordering appears be vanishing above jamming , while the tetratic ordering is growing .",
    "several works @xcite have suggested that geometric roughness on the surface of otherwise frictionless particles may provide a good model for the inter - particle tangential frictional forces that are usually present in dry granular systems .",
    "such roughness has been modeled @xcite by asperities on the surface of spherical particles , leading to a concave particle surface .",
    "one may therefore ask if the concave staples studied in the present work display any of the features usually associated with the jamming of frictional particles .",
    "our results , however , do not seem to find so .    in looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : compress ] , we see that the apparent jamming transition @xmath2 moves to slightly _ higher _ values as the compression rate @xmath42 _ decreases_. similar results have been found for frictionless spheres @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to what is observed for _ frictional _ spheres , where the _ slower _ the compression rate the _ lower _",
    "@xmath2 one finds @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of slowly sheared frictional systems @xcite show a discontinuous jump in the pressure at jamming , provided the friction coefficient is not too small . our results in fig .",
    "[ fig : shear_pz]a do not give any sign of such a discontinuous jump .",
    "we thus conclude that , for our staple shaped particles , inter - particle friction and geometric cohesion likely play quite different roles in the phenomenological behavior of granular materials .",
