    "the recent discovery by @xcite of the hypervelocity star sdss j090745.0 + 024507 ( hereafter the hvs ) has lent credence to the prediction of @xcite that dynamical encounters with the black hole in the galactic centre can eject stars with velocities up to several thousand kilometers per second . at a distance of 40 - 70@xmath2",
    ", the hvs has a heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath3 in a direction of @xmath4 from the galactic centre @xcite .",
    "once corrected for solar motion and galactic rotation , this translates into a velocity of about @xmath5 relative to the local standard of rest .",
    "this velocity , which represents the lower limit of the total space velocity , is significantly higher than that of any other runaway or high - velocity star in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "we investigate the origin of the extreme velocity of the hvs by means of kinematic analyses , binary evolution calculations and numerical scattering experiments .",
    "there are three possible explanations for the velocity of the hvs : ( i ) ejection upon supernova explosion of the companion in a binary system ; ( ii ) dynamical ejection after a close encounter with main sequence stars or stellar mass compact objects ; ( iii ) dynamical ejection from the galactic centre as a result of an encounter with the supermassive black hole .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in  2 we analyse the possibility of an origin in the galactic disk and an ejection by supernova explosion , in  3 we back - trace the orbit of the star in the galactic potential and constrain the value of its proper motion and in  4 we describe numerical scattering experiments of 3-body encounters involving main sequence ( ms ) stars , the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) and intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) .",
    "to address the possibility that the hvs is a high - velocity runaway resulting from the disintegration of a binary system , we turned to population synthesis . making use of the seba stellar evolution package @xcite , we generated two sets of @xmath6 binaries each . in the first set , primary masses ranged from @xmath7 down to the hydrogen burning limit . in the second",
    "set , the minimum primary mass was increased to @xmath8 , in order to get a larger sample of events for statistical purposes .",
    "the mass ratio in both cases was chosen from the distribution of @xcite , whilst the initial orbital separation was drawn from that of @xcite and truncated at @xmath9 r@xmath10 .",
    "the distribution of natal kick speeds for neutron stars was taken from @xcite , with a dispersion of @xmath11 .",
    "we assumed that the escape speed was the orbital speed of the secondary immediately before the binary disintegrated .",
    "as well , we only considered secondary stars with a mass below @xmath12 , given the known constraints on the mass of the hvs . from this synthesis experiment",
    ", we obtained maximum escape speeds of @xmath13 , an order of magnitude below the space velocity of the hvs .",
    "based upon this , we reject the high - velocity runaway hypothesis .",
    "the possibility that the system is a binary and that its high speed is the result of an asymmetric supernova kick can be discounted because , if we assume that the visible companion is on the main sequence , a kick magnitude in excess of @xmath14 would be required . while this can not be ruled out physically , the probability of the system remaining bound in such an event is negligible .",
    "the only alternative explanation for the high velocity of the hvs is an ejection during a dynamical encounter .",
    "stellar encounters involving ms stars , neutron stars or stellar mass black holes eject stars with maximum velocities on the order of the orbital velocity in binary systems @xcite .",
    "@xcite assume therefore that the hvs was ejected from the galactic centre by a strong encounter with the smbh .",
    "this possibility was first proposed by @xcite , who considered encounters of binaries with a smbh , and then further developed by @xcite , who found that encounters between binaries and the smbh or between single stars and a binary black hole represent the most efficient channel to eject hypervelocity stars .",
    "in the previous section we argue that the hvs must have been ejected from the galactic centre by a dynamical encounter with the smbh .",
    "this implies that the hvs originated in the milky way s central region . despite the incompleteness of available kinematic data",
    ", we trace back the orbit of the hvs in the galactic potential .",
    "the distance of the object is still uncertain , as it depends on its spectral type and evolutionary state .",
    "@xcite estimate a distance of @xmath15 for a b9.2 ms star and @xmath16 for a blue horizontal branch star , with an average value @xmath17 .",
    "we consider all three values in our analysis .",
    "we first assume that the star has no proper motion and trace its trajectory backward in time until it crosses the disc , using paczynski s model ( 1990 ) for the potential of the galaxy .",
    "the orbit , shown in fig . [ fig : orbit ] ( dashed line ) for the case @xmath17 , does nt pass through the galactic centre region .",
    "( solid line ) . the integration is stopped upon passage through the disc .",
    "the full dot represents the present position of the star at a distance of @xmath18 while the grey dots represent a schematic model of the galaxy.,width=264 ]    we then randomly generate the two proper motion components in the range 1 - 3@xmath19 and derive the three - dimensional positions and velocities in the galactocentric reference frame @xcite . for each distance value",
    "we generate about 5000 sets of initial conditions , integrate the trajectories and determine the minimum distance @xmath20 to the galactic centre .",
    "we find that there is at least one combination of proper motion components for each distance such that @xmath21 . in tab .",

    "[ fig : orbit ] ( solid line ) .",
    "we can use this analysis to calculate the minimum velocity with which the hvs should have been ejected from the disk in the case of the binary supernova scenario . assuming a random proper motion in the range 1 - 3@xmath19 , the minimum velocity at disk crossing ( corrected for galactic rotation ) is about @xmath30 , much larger than the average recoil velocity from a supernova explosion ( see   2 ) .",
    "this result supports the scenario of an origin in the galactic centre .",
    "we now explore the hypothesis of a dynamical ejection from the galactic centre by means of numerical simulations of three - body scatterings with the smbh . in fig .",
    "[ fig : enc ] we show three examples of encounters involving ms stars , the smbh and an imbh .",
    "the experiments are carried out with the sigma3 package included in the starlab software environment @xcite .",

    "are also specified for the stars .",

    "the maximum value @xmath34 is determined automatically for each experiment ( see @xcite for a description ) .",
    "energy conservation is usually better than one part in @xmath6 and , in case the error exceeds @xmath35 , the encounter is rejected .",
    "the accuracy in the integrator is chosen in such a way that at most 5% of the encounters are rejected .",
    "in all the experiments , we consider ms stars of mass @xmath36 ( as indicated by @xcite for a b9 star ) and radius @xmath37 , an imbh of mass @xmath38 and a smbh of mass @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the relative velocity at infinity between the single star and the binary s centre of mass is set equal to the dispersion velocity in the galactic centre ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the ejection velocities of escapers are taken at the distance at which the integrator stops @xcite .",
    "the effect of the black hole potential is negligible at this distance .",
    "close encounters between a binary and a very massive object can ( i ) break up the binaries and eject the two components with high speed ( _ ionizations _ ) , ( ii ) eject one star and leave the second star bound to the smbh ( _ exchange _ ) ( see the left panel of fig . [",
    "fig : enc ] ) .",
    "we perform scattering experiments between the smbh and binaries of ms stars . in all the runs ,",

    ".,width=264 ]    the fraction of encounters resulting in an exchange of the secondary star increases slowly from about 25% for @xmath51au to about 30% for @xmath52 au . since the binary components have equal masses , the probability of ejection for the two stars is equal in exchange encounters .",
    "ionizations are rare and only occur for @xmath53 0.2au , which marks the transition between hard and soft binaries @xcite . as a result ,",
    "high ejection velocities are mostly produced in exchange encounters .",
    "the total fraction of scatterings whose outcome is a star escaping with a velocity larger than @xmath29 decreases rapidly with increasing @xmath50 , and therefore binaries with semi - major axis 0.05au",
    "@xmath54 0.3au are the most suitable progenitors of hypervelocity stars . if we consider that about 20% of the simulated encounters result in the ejection of a hypervelocity star over the suggested range of orbital separations , the ejection rate provided by @xcite can be refined to @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the binary fraction .",
    "the fraction of physical collisions and mergers decreases steadily with increasing @xmath50 from @xmath5720% to @xmath572% , and mainly involve the binary components . collisions with the smbh occur in less than 1% of the cases .",
    "the merger products can remain bound to the smbh or escape its gravitational potential .",
    "we perform additional scattering experiments of encounters between binaries and the smbh to study the properties of the merger products .",
    "we consider equal mass binaries with mass @xmath58 ( in such a way that the mass of any possible merger is @xmath59 ) and radius @xmath60 .",
    "escapers are ejected with velocities larger than @xmath0 if the initial semi - major axis is in the range 0.03au @xmath54 0.05au . in this range , only about 6% of the encounters result in a binary merger with escape of the collision product .",
    "we therefore consider this scenario inefficient for the production of hypervelocity stars .",
    "we now consider the hypothesis that the smbh is in a binary with an imbh and interacts with single stars ( see the central panel of fig .",

    "ejection velocity of the hvs while the dotted line represents the analytical estimate by @xcite.,width=264 ]    the maximum velocity obtained in these encounters is about @xmath0 , barely sufficient to explain the velocity of the hvs .",
    "the comparison with the theoretical estimate ( dotted line ) by @xcite reveals a discrepancy of about a factor of 2 in the ejection velocities .",
    "the numerical results also flatten at large initial semi - major axes and deviate from the expected @xmath62 scaling .",
    "we have performed additional calculations with @xmath63 incoming stars but the average @xmath28 appears to be insensitive to the mass of the single star .",
    "it has been proposed @xcite that the galactic centre is populated by imbhs , with masses in the range @xmath64 .",
    "these imbhs may form in young dense star clusters as a result of runaway collisions @xcite and sink toward the galactic centre together with their parent cluster due to dynamical friction .",
    "while the cluster dissolves in the galactic potential , the imbhs continue to spiral in , possibly with a stellar companion , until they eventually interact with the smbh @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , imbhs must play a role in the dynamical encounters taking place in the few inner parsecs of the galaxy .",
    "we consider encounters between the smbh and a binary consisting of a ms star and an imbh .",
    "we select the binary semi - major axis in the range 0.1au@xmath65au , with the lower limit set by the imbh s tidal radius @xmath66 for the adopted masses and radii .",
    "we focus on the encounters whose final outcome is the break - up of the binary with subsequent ejection of star @xmath41 to infinity , while the imbh can either remain bound to the smbh or escape ( see the right panel of fig .",

    "figure [ fig : bkvel ] reports the velocity of the escaping star after the encounter as a function of the initial @xmath50 .",

    "the binary is hard and the total cross - section is dominated by exchange encounters . in this case , the escaping star gains energy at the expense of the imbh , which becomes bound to the smbh . for larger semi - major axes ,",
    "the binary is soft and tends to be ionized .",
    "the highest recoil velocities are generally obtained in exchange encounters .",
    "although this scenario can eject stars with hypervelocities over a wide range of orbital separations , only rarely eccentric orbits result in prompt ionization .",
    "prompt ionization only occurs for low angular momentum orbits , which comprise a fraction of about @xmath35 if we assume an isotropic velocity distribution . adopting a formation rate of @xmath68 for imbhs @xcite",
    ", the ejection rate can be as small as @xmath69 , where @xmath56 represents the fraction of imbhs with a stellar companion .",
    "low eccentricity orbits result in a slow inspiral of the binary due to dynamical friction , but , in this case , it is not clear whether the stellar density is sufficiently high to drag the binary to the tidal radius of the smbh . if an encounter with the smbh does take place , we expect the ejection velocity to be much lower than in the case of a prompt ionization .",
    "we have investigated the origin of the extreme velocity of the hvs by means of kinematic analyses , binary evolution calculations and numerical simulations of three - body encounters .    by tracing the trajectory of the hvs in the galactic potential ( using the available measurements for the distance and the radial velocity ) ,",
    "we have shown that a proper motion of about @xmath1 is required for the star to have come within a few parsecs from the smbh .",
    "we confirm the prediction by @xcite and @xcite that dynamical encounters with the smbh can eject hypervelocity stars to the galactic halo ; the hvs is likely the first discovered object of this kind .",
    "the most promising scenarios are dynamical encounters of ms stars with the smbh , possibly in a binary with an imbh .",
    "in particular , the encounter between a smbh and a stellar binary or between a single star and a binary black hole provide enough kinetic energy to eject hypervelocity stars over a restricted range of initial semi - major axes .",
    "we have also investigated the more exotic encounter between a smbh and an imbh orbited by a stellar companion .",
    "although this type of encounter can be very energetic and does nt require any constraint on the binary s hardness , it has a very low probability .",
