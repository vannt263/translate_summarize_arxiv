    "decoherence is that interference among different quantum states disappear because of dissipation - fluctuation to / from environments@xmath0 .",
    "it is said that decoherence makes a quantum system classical .",
    "because when interference vanishes , an object can not go to other quantum states .",
    "it means the object gets classicality .",
    "i have studied decoherence in a finite system .",
    "my motivation was the fact that semi - classical models , such as liquid drop model@xmath1 or tdhf@xmath2 , are not bad theories in nuclear physics .",
    "i wondered the fact .",
    "then i knew caldeira - leggett s theory@xmath3 .",
    "it is said that the key of decoherence is the external environment which is composed with an infinite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "although i was very impressed , i doubted the `` infinite numbers '' . because i thought that nuclear system , which is finite system , is classical to some extent .    in my previous paper@xmath4",
    ", there is an isolated system made with three degrees of freedom . and",
    "it is shown that one selected degree of freedom(particle-1 ) loses its quantum mechanical property because of the other two degrees of freedom(particle-2 and -3 ) .",
    "that is , decoherence occurs for particle-1 .",
    "the quantum mechanical model in the paper has a special property that decoherence occurs when classical trajectories intersect in a corresponding classical model .",
    "but we can not simply conclude that `` classical crossing makes decoherence '' .",
    "in caldeira - leggett s model@xmath3 in which a pair of gaussian packets is in a harmonic oscillator potential with a heat bath , decoherence does not occur when those gaussian packets cross in weakly damping case . and also in my model which i will show you in this paper , decoherence wo nt occur when coupling between main system and environments is not enough .",
    "strictly speaking , intersections of classical trajectories which contain some condition will make dephasing in corresponding quantum mechanical system , and the dephasing makes decoherence .",
    "that condition will be shown in this paper .",
    "this time , i used a model which added an external harmonic oscillator potential which interacts with only a main degree of freedom(particle-1 ) to my previous model which composed with three particles being tied with springs each other . as a result",
    ", it was shown that not only the intersection of classical trajectories but also branchings of classical trajectories are needed for decoherence .",
    "in other words , it was shown that interactions between a main system and environments have to make enough branchings of classical trajectories of the main system for decoherence .",
    "please imagine a closed system , there three particles are mutually tied with springs which have different angular frequencies respectively .",
    "lagrangian @xmath5 is as follow .",
    "( @xmath6 means position and mass of particle-1 respectively , etc . )",
    "@xmath7 for this lagrangian eq.(@xmath8 ) , we can get feynman propagator by a way of change of variables as i did in my previous paper .",
    "but this lagrangian is different from a lagrangian of my previous model@xmath4 . because , in this new model , respective masses can be different each other , and there is an external harmonic potential for particle-1 . in this case",
    ", it seems to be difficult to get a diagonal matrix and an orthogonal matrix to change of variables analtically .",
    "therefore , this time , i used numerical solution for them .",
    "i got the program to derive those matrices from `` miso no keisan buturigaku(http://www.geocities.jp / supermisosan/ ) '' . using the propagator ,",
    "we can write a time evolution of wave function of three body system .    initial wave function of the three body system is the product of wave functions of each particles at initial time @xmath9 . and the each initial state is schrdinger cat state , @xmath10 \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{e3 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] etc .. here , @xmath11 means @xmath12 , @xmath13 means half width of packet and @xmath14 means a normalization constant .",
    "when we are only interested in the information about a degree of freedom ( particle-1 ) as a subsystem , we should integrate out the information about particle-2 and -3 as environments .",
    "then we can get the information about particle-1 only , that is , the reduced density function for particle-1 , @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 furthermore , we can separate the quantum interference term from the reduced density , and a disappearance of the interference means decoherence .",
    "i used numerical integration in eq.([e4 ] ) and final normalization .",
    "this procedure above is basically the same as caldeira - leggett s technique@xmath3 .",
    "they used an influence functional method in which a feynman propagator includes effects of environmental degrees of freedom .",
    "the difference between my procedure here and theirs is only an order of integrals and path integrals .    on the other hand",
    ", we can draw corresponding classical trajectories . in a classical harmonic three body problem",
    ", we can draw spatial trajectories of particle-1 ( @xmath17 ) versus time t. each particle has 2 initial positions which are corresponding to centers of two gaussian packets in quantum system , and their all initial velocities are set 0",
    ". then we can draw @xmath18 trajectories on ( @xmath19-t ) plane .",
    "it is suggested that there should be some relationship between behaviors of classical trajectories and decoherence in a corresponding quantum system@xmath4 .",
    "time evolutions of a reduced density function @xmath15 derived from quantum mechanical calculation are shown in graphs ( a)-(l ) at fig.[f1 ] and fig.[f2 ] .",
    "as you can see , there are 2 packets in each graph .",
    "the right packet was at the origin ( @xmath20 ) initially .",
    "the left packet was at a distance ( @xmath21 ) initially .",
    "and there are 2 wave - like lines in each graph .",
    "the lower wave - like line is the quantum interference between these 2 packets .",
    "disappearance of the interference means an emergence of classicality , that is decoherence .",
    "time evolutions of the maximum values of interferences are shown in graphs ( n ) at fig.[f1 ] and fig.[f2 ] respectively .",
    "the upper wave - like line is the reduced density function for particle-1 . on the other hand , corresponding classical trajectories",
    "@xmath22 are shown in graphs ( m ) at fig.[f1 ] and fig.[f2 ] .",

    "an external harmonic potential for particle-1 is corresponding to a spring constant @xmath26=2.5 .",
    "initial wave function for particle-1 is eq.(@xmath27 ) in which @xmath28=-5.0 . for particle-2 and particle-3 , @xmath29=6.0 , @xmath30=7.5 respectively . and",
    "normalization constants @xmath31 can be set 1 , because we can use a numerical normalization . and @xmath32 .",
