    "the study of infrared plasmons  collective oscillations of free electron density  in a charge - doped graphene is a very rapidly growing field @xcite .",
    "multiple potential applications of graphene plasmonics @xcite are based or rely heavily upon the strong optical confinement and large density of states of graphene plasmons ( gp ) , which is the consequence of the gp wavelength being typically much shorter than the photon wavelength at the same energy ( @xmath0 ) @xcite .    at these conditions",
    ", however , the simplest possible means of gp excitation , i.e. , via photon absorption by a homogeneous graphene sheet , is not feasible since it is impossible to simultaneously conserve both energy and momentum .",
    "a lot of experimental and theoretical efforts have been devoted recently to the development of efficient optical and non - optical means to excite plasmons in graphene . some of these efforts employed particles with dispersion relations sufficiently different from that of free photons , e.g. , electrons @xcite , to be able to simultaneously conserve energy and momentum .",
    "other efforts focused on breaking the continuous translational symmetry of the system , so that only energy has to be conserved .",
    "these include the formation of transient diffraction grating on the surface of graphene by launching acoustic waves @xcite , as well as excitations of plasmons in near - field by a local defect like atomic force microscope ( afm ) tip @xcite , in - graphene impurities @xcite , or semiconductor quantum dot @xcite .",
    "the translational invariance can be broken not only by introduction of such _ external _ defects , but also by _ nano - patterning _ of graphene itself .",
    "specifically , optical excitation of gps in an array of graphene nanoribbons ( gnr ) has recently emerged as one of the dominant experimental means to study gps , fig .",

    "studies of gps using gnr arrays have already provided important insights into the nature of plasmon damping in graphene and the efficiency of the plasmon coupling to optical phonons in the surrounding material @xcite .    in order to use a gnr array to extract various properties of gps ( e.g. , dispersion relation ) , an accurate theoretical description of plasmon resonances in ( i ) an isolated gnr and ( ii )",
    "a gnr array is required .",
    "this has been addressed to some extent recently @xcite , however no systematic study in this regard has been undertaken . in this work we ( i )",

    "this solution can be directly used to analyze experimental results .",
    "classically , a plasmon mode within a single gnr can be thought of as a standing wave of charge `` sloshing '' perpendicular to the gnr axis .",
    "the insets in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic](b ) show schematically the charge distribution for the three lowest - energy gp modes .",
    "naively , one would think that the boundary condition of vanishing electric current at the gnr edges directly transforms into a reflection phase of @xmath3 , resulting in a standard quantization condition @xmath4 where @xmath1 is the gnr width and @xmath5 is the gp wavenumber corresponding to the @xmath6 mode .",
    "however , this is not entirely correct since just like any plasma oscillation , a gp consists of two coupled energy - carrying components : charge current and oscillating electric field .",
    "the current - vanishing boundary condition does obviously apply only to the current so that the electric field can effectively penetrate beyond the gnr edge resulting in a new quantization condition @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the @xmath9-dependent _ effective _ gnr width .",
    "this condition can also be expressed as @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an extra reflection phase accumulated by a plasmon during the `` propagation '' outside a gnr .",

    "the effective dielectric constant of environment , @xmath26 , then enters the problem via a modified electric field of a line charge , @xmath27 .",

    "furthermore , a simple size rescaling of eq .",
    "( [ eq : kop ] ) shows that @xmath58 and @xmath48 are functions of only two parameters : @xmath9 and @xmath12 , and not of @xmath2 or @xmath1 separately .",
    "therefore , one can say that the plasmonic response of different gnr arrays with the same @xmath12 belong to the same _ geometric universality class _ since @xmath38  the operator that encodes the geometry of a gnr array and determines the gp size quantization  is exactly the same for them up to the size rescaling .",
    "this geometric universality is a generalization of the previously introduced electrostatic scaling law @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the former is that the diagonalization of operator @xmath38 , done only once for each value of @xmath12 , gives not only the positions of resonance peaks but the full information on the frequency - resolved optical response of a gnr array via eq .",

    "furthermore , one can notice that the difference between @xmath66 for an isolated gnr ( @xmath30 ) and for a gnr array with @xmath67 is also non - negligible .",
    "at these conditions , gnrs in a very typical experimental configuration @xcite ( @xmath67 ) can not be considered isolated and the interaction between gnrs has to be accounted for by assuming @xmath68 and not @xmath69 as it was in the case of the isolated gnr .",

    "this observation can be rationalized by realizing that eq .",
    "( [ eq : l0 ] ) is based on zeroth - order eigenfunctions of @xmath38 so it does not account for coupling between gnrs .",
    "decreasing @xmath12 results in stronger interaction between gnrs and thus leads to an increasing deviation of non - interacting analytical results from the numerical ones .",
    "it is then rather counterintuitive that the analytics underestimates the resonance strength of the first plasmon mode _ only slightly for all _ @xmath12 .",
    "this phenomenon can be explained using the sum rule @xmath107 that is applicable for resonance strengths calculated from both the exact eigenfunctions of @xmath38 and the zeroth - order basis , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ssw ] ) and ( [ eq : l0 ] ) .",
    "the derivation of this sum rule is given in appendix  [ app : sum_rule ] .",
    "according to this sum rule , analytically overestimating the resonance strengths for all the modes with @xmath108 has to result in an underestimation of @xmath109 which is indeed the case .",
    "the reason why the analytical result for @xmath110 is only slightly less than the numerical one is that according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : l0 ] ) , @xmath48 decays rapidly with @xmath9 so that most of the total resonance strength , @xmath111 , has to be concentrated in the very first resonance .",
    "therefore , @xmath112 ( i.e. , @xmath113 ) no matter which basis set of the two is used .    at @xmath114",
    "the resonance strengths of plasmon modes have to decrease since @xmath115 corresponds to the case of homogeneous graphene where no plasmon can be excited by the homogeneous electric field assumed in this work .",
    "resonance strengths at @xmath108 are indeed in agreement with this expectation as is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda ] .",
    "however , the sum rule dictates that the total resonance strength is conserved so that it becomes more and more concentrated in the very first mode .",
    "along with this , @xmath66 grows with @xmath114 ( see table  [ tab : phi_lambda ] ) so that @xmath116 .",
    "these two observations lead to transformation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : seff ] ) into @xmath117 which is of course a quite expected result since the effective conductivity of a uniform graphene has to reduce to its intrinsic conductivity , @xmath57 .    to further corroborate this , fig .",

    "the zeroth - order eigenfunction , @xmath119 , is shown by a dashed red line for comparison .",
    "one can see that this analytical dependence most closely resembles the eigenfunction of the isolated gnr ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "once the distance between gnrs decreases , the numerically obtained eigenfunction deviates farther from the zeroth - order one and approaches a constant value of 1 ( shown by dashed black line as a guide for the eye ) .",

    "in this paper , we analyze the problem of spatially confined plasmon modes in gnr arrays .",
    "we demonstrate that this problem can be decoupled into the problem of a plasmon in a uniform graphene sheet and the problem of size quantization . by focusing on the latter",
    "we demonstrate that such a size quantization is purely geometric in nature , i.e. , the correct size quantization condition for plasmons in the gnr array is fully determined by the geometry of the array and nothing else .",
    "further , we introduce the notion of the _ geometric universality class _ of gnr arrays where arrays with the same value of @xmath12 ( other parameters are arbitrary ) belong to the same class .",

    "the tabulated data can be directly used in analysis of experimental data on optical response of gnr arrays .    finally , it is worthwhile to discuss the assumptions that were made in the very beginning of sec .",
    "[ sec : general ] .",
    "from the perspective of dimensional analysis , since @xmath12 is the only dimensionless parameter of the problem , the only possible equation for the frequency of plasmon resonances is ( neglecting the real component of graphene conductivity ) @xcite @xmath121 where @xmath122 is a certain  universal \" function of @xmath9 and @xmath12 . introducing other parameters to the problem may lead to a more complex  universal \" function if extra dimensionless combinations can be constructed .",

    "@xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath124 are physically irrelevant bringing us back to eq .",

    "finally , it is worth mentioning that the phenomenon considered in this work , i.e. , the penetration of the electric field beyond the gnr edges , is not the only possible source of the inequality @xmath134 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wp ] ) when realistic experimental conditions are considered .",
    "the quality of gnr edges can also affect the effective gnr width .",
