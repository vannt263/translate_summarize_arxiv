    "as the research of the complex systems is getting deeper and deeper , to find the universal rules and principles of these systems and to answer the origination of  complexity \" become more and more attractive @xcite .",
    "thus , the vision of physicists is no longer restricted in the traditional areas but concentrates on the more comprehensive domains , leading to the birth of many burgeoning disciplines through the interaction and amalgamation of physics and other fields such as biology , finance , sociology , and so on . over the last decade , there has been significant interest in applying physical methods in social and economical science @xcite . in particular , the study of financial market prices has been found to exhibit some universal properties similar to those observed in physical systems with a large number of interacting units , and some models @xcite ( as we know , the first stock market simulation was performed by economist stigler in 1964 @xcite ) have been introduced to the financial and more recently to the physical communities which attempt to capture the complex behaviors of stock market prices and market agents @xcite .",
    "these models , including behavior - mind model @xcite , dynamic - games model @xcite , multi - agent model @xcite and so on , are based on the statistical properties @xcite of price fluctuations which should be recovered by more suitable microscopic models @xcite : ( 1)sharp peak and fat - tail distribution for the price changes ( the return histogram ) @xcite ; ( 2)the distribution of returns decays with power law in the tails @xcite , with exponent near 3 ; ( 3)price fluctuations are not invariant against time reversal , i.e. they show a forward - backward asymmetry @xcite",
    ".    among the more sophisticated approaches are dynamic multi - agent models based on the interactions of two distinct agent populations (  noisy \" and  fundamental \" traders ) , which could simulate the price forming processes and reproduce some of the stylized observations of real markets , but fail to account for the origin of the universal characteristics .",
    "an alternative approach , the herd behavior @xcite explored in this paper , may be capable to induce the power - law asymptotic behavior in the tail of price return distribution with an exponent well fitting the truncated lvy regime @xcite as found in real data @xcite .",
    "this approach has been formalized by cont and bouchaud @xcite as a static percolation model .",
    "subsequently , this percolation model has been bettered by introducing a feedback mechanism between the price return @xmath0 and trader activity @xmath1 : @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the factor denoting the sensitivity to price fluctuations .",
    "then the volatility clustering can be reproduced , and all of the statistical properties of fluctuations for prices mentioned above could be observed .    in the cont - bonchaud model ,",
    "random percolation clusters are used as groups of traders . in the simple version , at each iteration each cluster buys with probability @xmath1 , sells with probability @xmath1 or sleeps with probability @xmath4 . when the activity @xmath1 is small , there are only few clusters trading at a time most of the times .",
    "therefore , the distribution @xmath5 of relative price fluctuations or  returns \" @xmath0 scales as the well - known @xcite cluster size distribution of percolation theory .",
    "but when we increase the value of @xmath1 , more and more clusters would make contribution to the relative price fluctuations and the central limit theorem suggests that the distribution @xmath5 convert from power - law tails to a more gaussian shape for large systems .",
    "price changes in the logarithm ( return ) are proportional to the difference between the supply and demand . on average , price rises or falls with equal probability and without correlations between consecutive steps .",
    "an assumption made in this model which should not be ignored is that the probability @xmath1 ( activity ) is set to be the same for all groups and remains constant through out the whole process , which may be a good strategy for simplifying a physical model but may be not a good regulation for establishing a model which we expect to reflect the various phenomena found in the real stock market as genuine as possible so it could be more helpful for us to capture the complex properties of the real world .",
    "although in the successional studies of the percolation model different mechanisms are used to establish a self - organized model where the investor groups with various trading activities and sizes are formed automatically , few of these models considered the fluctuations of the traders in the market , fact that there are always agents who take part in or exit from the market due to various reasons which might have a serious influence on the price .",
    "here we introduce a self - organized model where the activities and sizes of different investor groups are driven by the confliction and harmonization of the strategies adopted by different groups .",
    "the simulation results which well agree with the observations of real markets are also shown in the third section .",

    "considering an open market which absorbs and removes traders with probabilities respectively in the process of trading , we draw the growth and collapse of clusters into our model based on cont - bouchaud model s random percolation . after every @xmath7 iterations of trading ,",
    "each cluster which is defined in figure 1 grows around itself ( figure 1(a ) ) with probability @xmath8 , collapses and annihilates with probability @xmath9 , or sleeps with probability @xmath10 .",
    "once a cluster collapses , some new clusters will come into the market at the positions where the collapse occurred ( figure 1(b ) ) , with a fixed probability @xmath11 .",
    "we build our model as follows based on the thoughts above :    \\(1 ) initiation : a @xmath12 lattice is occupied randomly with probability @xmath13 , and each cluster is randomly given a state : buying , selling , or sleeping , which are represented by 1 , -1 and 0 respectively .",

    "the evolution of price follows the rule : @xmath19 where @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the number of buyers and sellers , respectively .",

    "then , each cluster buys , sells , or sleeps with probabilities @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 respectively , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 the first term on the right hand of both of equ.(4 ) denotes the probability with which the active one would buy rather than sell without considering the feedback of the price fluctuations .",
    "the difference between the case @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the coefficient of the last term on the right hand and takes into account that agents are risk adverse and thus more impressed by a downturn than by an upturn of the market so that the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote the sensitivity of the agent s mentality to the price fluctuations .",

    "the first situation is that new traders come into the market occupying the empty sites around the old clusters , for example , cluster * g * , just as the sites marked by hollow nodes proposed in figure 1(a ) with the probability @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a kinetic coefficient and @xmath38 is a threshold parameter @xcite , and @xmath39 in which @xmath40 represents the scale of the cluster @xmath41 , in other words , the number of nodes which belong to @xmath41 .",

    "if a few of different clusters whose states are different encounter , one ( noted by @xmath50 ) will defeat others ( the total number is @xmath51 , including @xmath50 ) with the probability @xmath52 and the evolution due to equ.(8 ) would lead to the consequence that the defeated clusters would accept the opinion and adopt the same strategy of the winner . in other words , they are annexed by the winner . by contrary , when the states of the encountered clusters are all the same , they would combine and operate as a whole .",

    "but there are some amazing results we should point out : ( 1 ) @xmath68 is not 0.5 but 0.59 , little larger than 0.5 , which is very close to the threshold value : 0.593 in the percolation theory which may be a support to the point that the real markets should operate close to the critical point where profitable trade opportunities are barely detectable @xcite .",
    "the process by which the market self - organizes close to the critical point is more likely to be of evolutionary nature and hence to take place on longer time scales @xcite . and",

    "figure 4 shows the probability density of normalized returns , which display a clear lvy distribution for @xmath53=1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 , 64 .    because larger @xmath53 implies less data points , it is difficult to determine the parameters characterizing the distributions only by investigating the spreads .",
    "hence , we studied the peak values at the center of the distributions , i.e. , the probability of zero return @xmath73 as the function of @xmath74 . with this choice",
    ", we can investigate the point of each probability distribution which is least affected by noise .",
