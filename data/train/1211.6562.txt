    "concerning the ultraviolet behavior of the mean field equations , the integral over the momentum is well - defined , thanks to the exponential decay in momentum space of the bare coulomb interaction @xmath78 between electrons and holes in the bilayers separated by a dielectric barrier of thickness @xmath55 . in our calculations we fixed the upper momentum cutoff for the integrations as @xmath79 .",
    "numerical stability was checked by increasing @xmath80 and increasing number of integration points .",
    "we confirmed that the results obtained by the newton method for @xmath81 agreed with a solution of the mean field equations independently obtained by a direct recursive method .",
    "in the superfluid state at low temperature , the static limit of the polarization bubble in the diagrammatic ( rpa - like ) resummation is suppressed at small momenta @xmath82 . reference 13 in the main text discusses this effect in the limiting case of no dielectric barrier , @xmath83 , for energy bands with linear dispersion .",
    "the polarization bubble is responsible for renormalizing the bare coulomb interaction .",
    "a small-@xmath82 suppression of the screening allows strong unscreened electron - hole pairing peaked at small-@xmath82 to occur , and this strong pairing can lead to a large gap in the excitation spectrum .",
    "we performed numerical calculations for the polarization bubbles for the case of quadratic energy bands . in the superfluid state",
    "the polarization bubble is given by the sum of the normal and anomalous bubbles ( eq .  4 in the main text and supplement fig .  4 ) .      in rpa",
    "the polarization bubbles are constructed with the normal and anomalous green s functions of bcs theory . assuming the green s functions are diagonal in the band indices , the normal and anomalous green s functions are given by , @xmath85 respectively , where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the bogoliubov factors @xmath88 the summation of the fermionic matsubara frequencies @xmath89 of the particle - hole loop",
    "can then be done analytically , and taking the static limit the expressions for the bubbles are given by , @xmath90 when the chemical potential @xmath91 is positive , the contributions of the lower band @xmath92 or @xmath93 to the total polarization bubbles are small because the corresponding @xmath94-states are filled and far in energy from @xmath91 .",
    "hence they contribute little to the particle - hole processes .",
    "we considered only the @xmath95 contribution and , as in the gap equation , only the s - wave harmonic of the geometrical form factor of graphene @xmath96 .",
    "physically , the effect of screening is suppressed because of the opening of the energy gap @xmath97 at the fermi surface .",
    "this exponentially suppresses particle - hole processes with energies less than the gap energy @xmath97 and it is precisely these low - energy processes that are needed to screen the long - range coulomb interaction .",
    "once a gap appears in the excitation spectrum , screening exactly vanishes in the @xmath98 limit . from a diagrammatic point of view , in addition to a suppression of the bubble with diagonal green functions at low momentum , there is an additional canceling contribution from the anomalous bubble with off - diagonal green functions . at @xmath98",

    "<S> exciton bound states in solids between electrons and holes are predicted to form a superfluid at high temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we show that by employing atomically thin crystals such as a pair of adjacent bilayer graphene sheets , equilibrium superfluidity of electron - hole pairs should be achievable for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> the transition temperatures are well above liquid helium temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> because the sample parameters needed for the device have already been attained in similar graphene devices , our work suggests a new route towards realizing high - temperature superfluidity in existing quality graphene samples .    </S>",
    "<S> it is proving a challenging task to observe superfluidity in a semiconductor electron - hole double quantum well system . despite long - standing theoretical predictions@xcite and significant experimental efforts@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , it is only very recently that bose - einstein condensation of excitons has been observed in this system.@xcite the transition temperature was low , @xmath0 k , and the condensate was non - equilibrium because of the fast recombination of the photo - excited excitons . </S>",
    "<S> major obstacles blocking experimental realization of equilibrium superfluidity in these systems include the following . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) in most semiconductors , the electron and hole energy bands are badly mismatched . in gaas not only </S>",
    "<S> do the effective masses differ by a factor of five , but the holes have highly non - parabolic energy dispersion and spin-@xmath1 characteristics.@xcite ( b ) the large bandgap in gaas means a bias of @xmath2 ev needs to be applied across the dielectric barrier . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a huge electric field across the barrier making it extremely hard to fabricate barriers thin enough for the electrons and holes to bind together while avoiding leakage between the layers . </S>",
    "<S> the formation of excitons is exponentially suppressed once the thickness @xmath3 of the barrier separating the two quantum wells exceeds the effective bohr radius @xmath4@xcite ( @xmath5 nm for gaas ) . with the narrowest gaas quantum wells widths @xmath6 nm and barrier thicknesses @xmath7 nm to avoid leakage , the minimum effective layer separation @xmath8 remains @xmath9.@xcite    an alternative system , two graphene monolayers of electrons and holes separated by a dielectric barrier ( 2xmlg ) , </S>",
    "<S> has recently been proposed to observe this elusive superfluid.@xcite this system has some clear advantages over the gaas system . </S>",
    "<S> graphene is a gapless semiconductor with nearly identical conduction and valence bands so the mismatch between the electron and hole fermi surfaces is almost eliminated . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the availability of very thin dielectric barriers separating the two monolayers makes the region with strong electron - hole pairing effects easily attainable . </S>",
    "<S> a barrier thickness as small as @xmath10 nm has already been demonstrated with a hexagonal boron nitride ( hbn ) dielectric.@xcite the barrier can be made so thin for graphene both because there is no need for a large bias between the electron and hole layers , and also because hbn has a much larger bandgap ( @xmath11 ev ) than the barrier between double quantum wells in gaas ( @xmath12 ev ) , allowing the barrier thickness to be readily reduced without electrical leakage between the layers .    </S>",
    "<S> however there is a new obstacle with graphene associated with the linear single - particle energy dispersion @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> this makes it difficult to access the region of strong interactions . </S>",
    "<S> also , bound excitons do not form because of the massless carriers.@xcite the ratio @xmath14 is a useful measure of the importance of interactions relative to kinetic energy . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 is the average coulomb interaction energy , where @xmath16 is the charge carrier density and @xmath17 is the dielectric constant . in graphene </S>",
    "<S> the fermi velocity @xmath18 ms@xmath19 is independent of @xmath16 and the fermi momentum for the spin-@xmath20 carriers in 2d is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the pseudospin factor . </S>",
    "<S> the fermi energy is then @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> this makes @xmath24 for monolayer graphene , a constant of order unity , while recent theory suggests that an electron - hole superfluid can only occur at measurable temperatures for @xmath25 in the 2xmlg system.@xcite very recent experiments have shown no evidence of superfluidity in this system despite achieving barrier thicknesses as low as @xmath26 nm.@xcite this poses an exciting challenge : can new experimentally realistic structures be designed using atomically thin crystals that allow the transition to a superfluid state ?    </S>",
    "<S> we concentrate here on bilayer graphene since it has been well characterized and exhibits extremely low levels of disorder , but a number of other such crystals are possible.@xcite our proposed system ( 2xblg ) consists of a pair of parallel bilayer graphene sheets ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the lower bilayer sheet is an electron bilayer comprising two parallel , @xmath27-@xmath28 stacked , closely coupled electron layers of graphene with layer separation @xmath29 nm.@xcite there is strong electron hopping between the two layers in the sheet . </S>",
    "<S> the upper bilayer sheet is a hole bilayer consisting of two @xmath27-@xmath28 stacked hole layers , but is otherwise analogous to the lower bilayer sheet with an identical layer separation @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the two bilayer sheets are separated by a hbn insulating barrier of width @xmath31 to prevent tunneling between the sheets . </S>",
    "<S> there are separate electrical contacts to the two layers and a bias @xmath32 can be applied between them . </S>",
    "<S> the bias @xmath32 and biases @xmath33 and @xmath34 on top and bottom metal gates allow independent control over the carrier density in each layer and can adjust the symmetry of the electric field across the two sheets . by tuning the three biases , a wide range of electron and hole densities </S>",
    "<S> can be achieved .        </S>",
    "<S> bilayer graphene eliminates the problems caused by the linear dispersion of monolayer graphene since over a wide range of electron or hole densities , @xmath35 @xmath36 , symmetrically biased graphene bilayers behave as a zero gap semiconductor with a quadratic dispersion around the fermi level@xcite : @xmath37 the effective mass is @xmath38 to @xmath39 , depending on the carrier density.@xcite at very high densities @xmath40 @xmath36 , @xmath41 crosses over to linear behavior , but this density region lies in the weakly interacting regime and is not of interest . at very low densities @xmath42 @xmath36 a trigonal warping of the bands transforms the two quadratic bands into three sets of dirac - like linear bands.@xcite this warping can be reduced if necessary by applying an asymmetric bias across each of the two bilayers which will also open up a gap separating the conduction and valence bands .    with quadratic energy dispersion , </S>",
    "<S> the fermi energy in the bilayer sheet depends linearly on density , @xmath43 , so the parameter @xmath44 now has a density dependence , @xmath45 . to experimentally reach large @xmath44 and the strongly interacting regime in the bilayer sheet , </S>",
    "<S> it is enough to decrease the carrier density @xmath16 with suitable gate voltages . in graphene sheets </S>",
    "<S> the lowest density is restricted by onset of electron puddle formation , which occurs at densities below @xmath46 @xmath36 in high quality graphene bilayers.@xcite this corresponds to @xmath47 in the strongly interacting regime .    </S>",
    "<S> we know that @xmath48 ensures strong electron - hole pairing . for a 2xblg system embedded in a hbn dielectric with @xmath49,@xcite setting @xmath50 and using the reduced mass yields an effective bohr radius @xmath51 nm . </S>",
    "<S> this is large compared with the thickness of barriers already fabricated , @xmath52 nm @xmath53.@xcite    .parameters for 2xblg , 2xmlg , and electron - hole gaas double quantum well ( gaas dqw ) systems . for @xmath4 and ry@xmath54 we use the reduced mass . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath55 is minimum effective layer separation . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath56 and @xmath44 are maximum particle spacing and maximum @xmath44 experimentally attained . </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath57localized excitons do not form in 2xmlg.@xcite ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we now discuss the experimental consequences of our phase diagram . even at the lowest density @xmath58 @xmath36 , </S>",
    "<S> the transition temperatures in systems ( a ) and ( b ) remain above liquid helium temperatures </S>",
    "<S> . there will be strong experimental signatures of the superfluid below @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> although the pairs are neutral , the ability to make separate electrical contacts to the electron and hole layers allows for spectacular electrical effects.@xcite coulomb drag and inter - layer tunneling measurements will show significant enhancements as @xmath60 is decreased below @xmath59,@xcite while counterflow measurements can directly probe the superflow.@xcite even up to room temperature there will be strong signatures of the pseudogap in phenomena such as compressibility , specific heat capacity and spin susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> the wide density range over which superfluidity can be observed in a single device is in marked contrast with high-@xmath59 superconductors , where superconductivity occurs only in a narrow 30% band of doping centered at optimal doping .    </S>",
    "<S> the 2xblg system is the first multiband system with just one condensate . </S>",
    "<S> it is an opposite case to multiband superconductors such as magnesium - diboride where pairing is only within the bands and multiple coupled condensates appear , one condensate and one gap for each band.@xcite in contrast , in the 2xblg system , pairing is only possible between the different hole and electron bands , leading to a single condensate and a single gap .    </S>",
    "<S> the combination of extremely thin barriers , large @xmath44 , near - equal effective masses , and strong pairing attraction makes the 2xblg system ideal for observing high-@xmath59 superfluidity . in existing quality samples it should be possible to study the phase transition from fermi - liquid to superfluid as well as the pseudogap physics . </S>",
    "<S> our approach would also apply more generally to other small gap semiconductors that can be made into atomically thin flakes and used with dielectrics such as hbn .    </S>",
