    "noncommutative geometry  @xcite has suggested the introduction of _ fuzzy _ spaces , namely the approximation of the abelian algebra of functions on an ordinary space , with a finite rank matrix algebra , which preserves the symmetries of the original space , at the price of noncommutativity .",
    "the first formalization of the idea of a fuzzy space was introduced by madore @xcite , for the sphere . in his approach ,",
    "a fuzzy sphere is a sequence of nonabelian algebras , generated ( loosely speaking ) by three `` noncommutative coordinates '' which satisfy @xmath1 and @xmath2=\\kappa \\varepsilon_{ijk } x_k$ ] , with @xmath3 some noncommutativity parameter .",
    "the connection with the finite dimensional representations of @xmath4 is immediate , and with @xmath3 proportional to the inverse of the rank of the representation , one can think of recovering functions on the sphere in some limit .",
    "this limit has been made rigorous by rieffel  @xcite at the level of topological `` quantum spaces '' , but here we are more interested in the approximations that the fuzzy matrix geometry can give to the space of functions ( and hence of fields ) defined on some space .",
    "this is efficiently done defining `` fuzzy spherical harmonics ''  @xcite , a basis for the matrix algebra , which in the limit converges to the ordinary spherical harmonics .",
    "field theory on the fuzzy sphere is a very active field of research .",
    "a partial list of references is  @xcite .",
    "after the fuzzy sphere , similar approximations for higher dimensional spheres  @xcite , for the torus , based on the noncommutative torus algebra  @xcite , and for projective spaces  @xcite , have also been studied . in previous work",
    "@xcite , we proposed a fuzzy approximations for the algebra of functions on a disc ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "it is the first example of a fuzzy approximation for a space that classically has a boundary .",
    "the space is defined through a suitable truncation of the noncommutative plane . in this paper",
    "we examine the spectral properties of the fuzzy laplacian , finding its eigenvalues and eigenvectors , and comparing them with the exact case and give a direct way to associate , to functions on the disc , their fuzzy counterpart , i.e.  to approximate the abelian algebra of functions by a sequence of finite rank matrices .",
    "we introduce a basis for the algebra of functions on the fuzzy disc in terms of symbols of the eigenmatrices of the fuzzy approximation to the laplacian .",
    "these symbols are seen to converge , as the rank of the matrices increases , towards a set of functions on the plane which coincide with the ordinary bessel functions of first kind ( eigenfunctions of the ordinary laplacian with dirichlet boundary conditions ) for points on a plane inside a disc , and to zero for points outside this disc .",
    "these are given the name of fuzzy bessel functions .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in the next section we review the fuzzy sphere from a perspective which will render easy the generalization to the disc case .",
    "the main tool we use is the weyl - wigner formalism , and the concept of generalized coherent sates , which we briefly review in appendices  [ appww ] and  [ appz ] respectively . in section",

    "constraining the dimension @xmath6 of the truncation to the noncommutativity parameter , @xmath7 , one obtains then a sequence of finite rank matrices , converging towards an abelian algebra of operators , that approximates functions whose support is concentrated on a disc of radius @xmath8 . on this sequence of states , fuzzy derivatives and a fuzzy laplacian",

    "it is well known that it is possible to define a basis for the space of functions on the disc in terms of a suitable set of bessel functions .",

    "consider a lie group @xmath179 , and @xmath191 a unitary irreducible representation of this group on a hilbert space @xmath192 .",
    "chosen a _ fiducial _",
    "vector @xmath193 in @xmath192 , one obtains a set of vectors for each element of the group , acting on it with @xmath191 : |_g(g)|_0  .",
    "two such vectors are considered _ equivalent _ if they correspond , quantum - mechanically , to the same state , i.e. if they differ by a phase .",

    "if @xmath197 is maximal , then it is called isotropy subgroup for the state @xmath193 . choosing a representative @xmath200 in each equivalence class @xmath201 ( which is a cross section of the fiber bundle @xmath179 with base @xmath202 ) defines a set of vectors on @xmath192 , depending , clearly , on @xmath179 and @xmath193 .",
    "this set of states is called a _ system of coherent states _ for @xmath179 .",
    "the state corresponding to the vector @xmath203 may be considered as the range of a rank one projector in @xmath192 .",
    "thus , the system of generalised coherent states determines a set of one dimensional subspaces in @xmath192 , parametrised by points of the homogeneous space @xmath204 .",
    "an evolution of this analysis drives naturally to the issue of overcompleteness for the system of coherent states , mentioned in  ( [ hwcomplete ] ) ,  ( [ su2complete ] ) .",
    "the aim of this appendix is to show an explicit proof of the results claimed in the main text about the eigenvalue problem for the fuzzy laplacian . in particular , we want to prove that the equation  ( [ eigeqenn ] ) is equivalent to the equation  ( [ eigeqpolyn ] ) . from this equivalence",
    ", it will be proved also the equivalence between equations  ( [ eigeqdiagoen ] ) and equation  ( [ eigeqpolydiago ] ) , as they are a special case of the first two for @xmath134 .",

    "the characteristic polynomial @xmath207 is given by the determinant of the matrix  ( [ secnmat ] ) given recursively by  ( [ detn ] ) .",

    "it coincides with the coefficient of the zeroth order term of the polynomial @xmath209 .",

    "the equality of the coefficients , of the remaining order terms , of the polynomial ( [ ennutinam ] ) with those of the polynomial @xmath212 can be easily checked .    at this stage , we have proved that the polynomial @xmath212 satisfies the same recursive relation that the polynomial @xmath213 does satisfy . the recursive relation they satisfy is such that the @xmath214 term of the sequence @xmath205 , for each fixed @xmath110 , depends on both the @xmath215 and @xmath216 terms of the sequence . to prove the complete equivalence of these two polynomials , we thus need to prove that they explicitly coincide at a pair of consecutive steps .    in the main text",
    "it has been stressed that there is a constraint for allowed positive @xmath110 , namely an upper bound : @xmath217 .",
    "this means that , for a fixed @xmath110 , that is for a fixed subspace in the fuzzy algebra , @xmath218 . for @xmath219 both polynomials @xmath220 and @xmath221 are trivial , so we study at first the case of @xmath222 .",
    "we have : e_n^(n)=_k=0 ^ 1(-1)^k+1 ( x^(n))^k = x^(n)-(n+1)while the matrix representing the action of the fuzzy laplacian is one - dimensional , so that : p_n^(n)=x_n-(2n+1 )  .",
