    "since their advent just over twenty years ago , cosmological inflationary models have been developed to try to deal with several problems arising in the standard cosmology .",
    "the most important consequence of an inflationary stage in the very early universe is the development of perturbations in space  time and matter , which eventually evolve into the structures we observe in the universe today .",
    "the simplest model with an inflationary stage is where inflation is driven by a single scalar field , called the inflaton , with some potential @xmath4 .",
    "if the potential is flat enough , theory predicts that adiabatic perturbations are generated which obey the gaussian statistics and have an almost scale - free spectrum ( for recent reviews see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "however , the most important drawback for inflationary cosmology is that there is no unique candidate for the inflaton field and its potential .",
    "furthermore , according to our theories of particle physics , there are a large number of scalar fields which , potentially , could be important in the early universe .",
    "for example , hybrid inflation is a model , in which two scalar fields are important : whereas one field drives an inflationary epoch , the dynamics of the second field will end this period of inflation @xcite . if inflation itself is driven by two or more scalar fields , the perturbations are no longer purely adiabatic or gaussian @xcite-@xcite .",
    "moreover , the transition to the normal radiation  dominated epoch depends on the decay of the scalar fields into radiation and matter , which could influence the evolution of perturbations as well .",
    "cosmological observations by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) , the planck surveyor , 2df and sloan digital sky survey will put strong constraints on the nature of the primordial perturbations and therefore put constraints on more complicated models of inflation and the process of reheating .    although formalisms have been presented in order to study two ",
    "field inflation ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) , no explicit model has been used in order to examine the background evolution of both fields and the consequences for the perturbations . in this paper , we investigate the evolution of two scalar fields , each with a potential of the form @xmath5 $ ] , and examine the effect of the parameters @xmath6 on the evolution of the universe .",
    "this potential includes pure exponentials ( @xmath7 ) , pure power law ( @xmath8 ) and combinations of the two . for a single scalar field , this potential was investigated in detail in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "exponential potentials appear in kaluza ",
    "klein theories as well as in supergravity and superstring models ( for a review , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "models based on dynamical supersymmetry breaking involving fermion condensates motivate inverse power potentials @xcite ; supergravity corrections to these models in turn predict potentials of the form above @xcite .",
    "furthermore , models motivated by higher  dimensional theories and/or scalar ",
    "tensor theories easily incorporate these potentials .",
    "for example , the form of the potential was used in @xcite to examine inflation with a background dilaton field .",
    "the potentials just described were used both in inflationary cosmology as well as in models for dark energy , driving the observed acceleration of the universe at the present epoch ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the potential above has interesting properties , allowing for scaling behavior and other attractor  like solutions ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "however , our goal in this paper is to obtain an understanding of the dynamics of two scalar fields with this potential which drive an inflationary epoch in the _ early _ universe .",
    "this , in turn , allows us to study further the consequences for the perturbations , in the two scalar fields and the space ",
    "time metric , _ during _ the inflationary epoch .",
    "this can be seen as a first step to understanding the initial perturbations in the radiation dominated era , which eventually evolve into the structures we observe today .",
    "we would like to emphasize , however , that in order to calculate the perturbations in the radiation dominated epoch , an understanding of the decay of both scalar fields is needed .",
    "there are some possibilities we would like to mention :    * both scalar fields decay , one into radiation and baryonic matter , the other field only into dark matter .",
    "the second field could , in principle , also decay only partly into dark matter , whereas the `` rest '' provides an explanation for dark energy . *",
    "only one scalar field decays completely into matter and radiation , the other decays partly into some form of matter ; the remains of the field play the role of dark energy .",
    "* one of the fields plays the role of the curvaton field @xcite , i.e. it decays well after the inflationary epoch and is responsible for the curvature perturbation .",
    "there are more possibilities , of course , but it is clear that the subsequent evolution of perturbations in the metric and matter fields strongly depends on which of these possibilities is realized .",
    "the situation is now far more complicated when compared to inflationary models based on one scalar field alone .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we present the equations of motion ; section 3 discusses the case of two independent potentials for both fields , i.e. the total potential is given by @xmath9 +   v_{0_\\chi } \\chi^{-\\alpha } \\exp [ -\\beta \\chi^m]$ ] ; in section 4 we investigate a mixed potential of the form @xmath10 $ ] . in sections 3 and 4",
    "we discuss all of the possible cases in detail .",
    "these two sections are necessarily technical .",
    "however , we have included a summary of our results at the end of each section .",
    "readers who are not interested in the technical aspects may wish to refer to these summaries .",
    "the perturbations are discussed in section 5 ; we present our conclusions in section 6 .",
    "our starting point shall be that of einstein gravity with two scalar fields and a general potential @xmath11 .",

    "roll is an attractor in our model and that we shall be justified in making this approximation .",

    "compared with the case of two exponential potentials , the contribution of the entropy to the total perturbation is larger , but we see that the entropy modes are always smaller in magnitude than the curvature perturbation .",
    "furthermore , adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations are effectively uncorrelated .",
    "the cleft in the plot arises from the background fields having the same evolution as they each have the same @xmath1 .",
    "it is the clear that from our definition of @xmath260 that this quantity should be almost zero in this cleft .",
    "once more the spectral index of the tenors is very small .",
    "we now consider the case of one field having an inverse power potential and the other an exponential potential .",
    "again , we can transform the inverse power law potential into a exponential potential .",
    "it is then clear from the discussion of the last two subsections that the results for the spectra must be similar , as one can observe in figure [ fig : mix1 ] .",
    "once more the features observed here are very similar to the cases studied so far .",
    "we set @xmath261 and vary the other parameters .",
    "the data are shown in figures [ fig : coup1 ] .",
    "in general , all our models generate almost scale  invariant spectra with minimal tensor production .",
    "this also allows both red and blue spectra as seen in figure [ fig : wmapdata ] .",
    "furthermore , we are able to get arbitrarily close to scale  invariance by allowing more inflation . in addition , we find that the perturbations produced are essentially uncorrelated .",
    "let us comment on the compatibility with current experiments .",
    "the wmap results have provided strong constraints on the initial power spectrum and hence on inflationary models @xcite .",
    "if one examines figure [ fig : wmapdata ] one sees that it possible to have @xmath262 we include the equivalent plot for our models .",
    "one open issue we have not discussed is the end inflation .",
    "this may be caused by another scalar field .",
    "this process is , in general , non  adiabatic and would generate further entropy production which would add to that from the two fields .",
    "hence , the spectra deep in the radiation dominated epoch depend on the details of reheating . without a detailed study of this mechanism it is impossible to draw firm conclusions from the entropic values in all cases",
    "in this paper we have studied in considerable depth inflationary solutions generated by two scalar fields and potentials of the form @xmath263 .",
    "this potential is very general and encompasses potentials motivated by supergravity and string theory and more general theories motivated by higher ",
    "dimensional gravity .",
    "we have seen that it is possible to generate a large range of different inflating universes by varying the parameters in the theory .",
    "we find that slow ",
    "roll is a valid approximation by means of numerical calculations and we are able to verify that the analytic solutions presented in this paper hold . for two uncoupled fields ( section 3 ) , we found that , often , only one of the fields is dominant .",
    "however , we also found solutions where both fields are important for the inflationary dynamics . for two coupled fields with the above potential ( section 4 )",
    ", we have found that only one of the fields dominates inflation , whereas the other field is only a background field .",
    "this case might be interesting if the background field acted as a curvaton field , for example .",
    "we have used some of the background solutions we found to describe the evolution of the perturbations in two specific cases and , potentially , one would be able to find the transfer functions for all the solutions discussed here .",
    "we have demonstrated this with two examples . in general",
    ", however , one has to resort to numerical methods in order to evaluate the transfer functions .",
    "the solutions presented here thus allow one to make predictions about the relative size of @xmath207 and @xmath208 for a large class of inflationary scenarios .",
    "we made use of numerical calculations to investigate consequences for cosmological perturbations .",
    "we discussed the case where both fields contribute approximately equally to the expansion rate during a period of slow ",
    "roll inflation .",
    "we found that our models produce scale  invariant spectra with a small scalar ",
    "tensor ratio . by varying the parameters of the potential",
    ", it is possible to produce both red and blue spectra for the curvature perturbation .",
    "this is still consistent with observational constraints .",
    "although the exact details depend on the initial condition of the fields , we don not expect our conclusions will be changed qualitatively . in the case of double inflation",
    ", one can generate uncorrelated @xcite,@xcite as well as correlated perturbations , @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in multi  field inflationary models with run ",
    "away potentials , the perturbations are always uncorrelated .    in order to make predictions for the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation",
    ", one has to follow the perturbations into the radiation dominated era , which involves a detailed calculation of the decay of both fields .",
    "ending inflation in the class of models discussed here will involve presumably a third field , which becomes important just at the end of the inflationary stage .",
