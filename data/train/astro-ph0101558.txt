    "the cygnus loop is the prototype of evolved shell - like supernova remnants ( snr ) .",
    "its large apparent size and high surface brightness make it an ideal object for the study of the interaction between the supernova blast wave and the interstellar matter or the interstellar cloud in detail .",
    "theoretical calculations of these interactions have been carried out by many authors ( sgro 1975 ; mckee & cowie 1975 ; mckee & ostriker 1977 ; spitzer 1982 ; mckee 1987 ; klein , mckee & colella 1994 ) .    various optical and ultraviolet observations of the cygnus loop have been performed to study the shock waves and their interactions .",
    "cox ( 1972 ) suggested that the cygnus loop is in the radiative cooling phase of its evolution .",
    "x - ray observations , however , revealed that the cygnus loop is in the adiabatic phase and is still evolving ( e.g. ku et al.1984 ; charles et al .",
    "1985 ; miyata et al .",
    "mckee & cowie ( 1975 ) modeled the interaction between a blast wave and an interstellar cloud and were able to explain the discrepancies between the optically measured velocities of the filaments and the blast wave velocity inferred from x - ray observations .",
    "there are two models to explain the apparent optical and x - ray emission ; an evaporation model and a reflection shock model .",
    "the evaporation model was proposed by mckee & cowie ( 1975 ) .",
    "they modeled a blast wave propagating into an inhomogeneous interstellar medium where there are many small clouds ( cloudlets ) . in this model ,",
    "the cloudlets are not directly heated by the shock wave but are evaporated due to thermal conduction by the ambient hot gas .",
    "this model was applied to both optical data ( fesen , blair , & kirshner 1982 ) and x - ray data ( tsunemi & inoue 1980 ; ku et al .",
    "it was , however , ruled out for the eastern region of the cygnus loop ( e.g. hester & cox 1986 , hereafter hc ) .",
    "recent observations of [ ] emission at the eastern region also suggests that thermal evaporation does not play an important role ( szentgyorgyi et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the reflection shock is important when the cloud size is large ( @xmath1 1pc ) .",
    "recent optical and x - ray data have been explained in the context of this model at various portions of the cygnus loop ; the southeastern blob ( se blob ) by graham et al .",
    "1995 , the eastern region by hc and raymond et al .",
    "1988 , and the northeastern ( ne ) region by hester , raymond & blair 1994 .",
    "such a large scale cloud reminds us of a pre - existing cavity wall produced by the precursor , as was first proposed by mccray & snow ( 1979 ) .",
    "shull & hippelein ( 1991 ) measured proper motions at 39 locations within the cygnus loop and found an asymmetric expansion of the shell .",
    "they also concluded the existence of a pre - existing cavity wall around the cygnus loop .",
    "this model is also supported by observations of coronal iron line emission ( teske 1990 ) , observations with iras ( braun & strom 1986 ) and observations with the rosat hri ( levenson et al .",
    "miyata & tsunemi ( 1999 , hereafter mt ) found a large density discontinuity at the ne region .",
    "combined with a large estimated mass of the progenitor star , they also supposed the existence of a pre - existing cavity .    in this paper , we carried out spatially - resolved x - ray spectroscopy of the eastern and northern regions of the cygnus loop .",
    "data analyzed here were obtained with the asca observatory and the rosat observatory .",
    "we observed the eastern and northern regions of the cygnus loop in 1993 - 1994 with the asca observatory ( tanaka , inoue , & holt 1984 ) . figure  [ fig : ana :",
    "limb : image ] shows the location of sis fovs with black squares superimposed on an x - ray surface brightness map of the cygnus loop ( aschenbach & leahy 1994 ) .",
    "a detailed observational log is given in table  [ obslog ] .",
    "we used the faint - mode data obtained with the sis to achieve the best spectral resolution ( yamashita et al .",
    "we excluded the data taken at an elevation angle below 5@xmath2 from the night earth rim and 50@xmath2 from the day earth rim , a geomagnetic cutoff rigidity lower than 6 gev c@xmath3 , and the region of the south atlantic anomaly .",
    "we also eliminated times when the pulse heights of corner pixels rapidly change .",
    "we then removed the hot and flickering pixels and corrected cti , dfe , and echo effects ( dotani et al .",
    "1995 ; dotani et al .",
    "1997 ) in our data sets by using sispi and faint commands . since we performed the observation of the northern region in the asca pv phase , the residual dark distribution ( rdd ) effect",
    "is not serious even for 4ccd mode data .",
    "however , the data of the eastern region observed in 1994 were degraded due to the rdd effect ( see detail in dotani 1995 ) .",
    "therefore , we corrected the rdd effect for the eastern region using the frame data obtained near to the epoch of our observation .",
    "we retrieved the frame data taken for the calibration observation of cyg x-1 and anonymous sky ( their sequence numbers are 18941107 , 10021040 and 10021060 ) since they were observed in 1994 november .",
    "x - ray spectra accumulated in four regions are shown in figure  [ all_spec ] .",
    "we can confirm that the x - ray emission is dominated by thermal emission and emission lines from mg and si are clearly detected whereas emission lines from o , ne , and fe are weak .",
    "we investigated the spatial distribution of physical parameters using the sis data in detail , using the same method as in mt in the northern region . in the northern region , we divided our fov into 3 squares each of which corresponds to the half - power diameter of the xrt ( serlemitsos et al .",
    "furthermore , we arranged the small squares such that each square overlapped adjacent squares by 2 resulting in 400 spectra .    in the eastern region , however , the surface brightness is lower than that of the northern region as shown in table  [ obslog ] .",
    "we divided our fov into 5  in order to obtain statistics similar to those for the northern region .",
    "each small region is arranged such that each square overlapped adjacent squares by 2 resulting in 49 spectra from each eastern region .",
    "because the optical axes of sis0 and sis1 were different from each other , we employed the ascatool library to adjust the optical axes . after adding the spectra of sis-0 and sis-1",
    ", we applied the single component non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) model coded by k. masai ( masai 1984 ; masai 1994 ) to each spectrum .",
    "free parameters of the fitting were @xmath0 , ionization parameter ( log(@xmath4 ) ) , abundances of o , ne , mg , si , fe , and ni , and emission measure ( em in @xmath5 pc ) . values for the reduced @xmath6 ranged from 1 to 2 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ana : east : kt ] shows the spatial variation of @xmath7 and log(@xmath4 ) for the eastern region .",
    "we find a complicated @xmath0 structure revealed by the sis .",
    "the values of @xmath0 do not smoothly increase toward the center of the cygnus loop , but have local maxima at the crossing point of three observations ( @xmath1 0.6 kev ) and the northern region of pos - eu  ( @xmath1 0.8 kev ) .",
    "this @xmath0 distribution can not be explained with a blast wave model propagating into a homogeneous medium .",
    "on the contrary , the spatial variation of log@xmath8 is relatively uniform with @xmath9 .",
    "we can confirm the hot plasma is still in the ionizing phase .",
    "we retrieved the rosat pspc data from the heasarc / gsfc .",
    "the sequence number was rp500090 .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness map obtained with the rosat pspc is shown in figure  [ fig : ana : east : pspc ] ( upper ) .",
    "black squares show the fovs of the siss .",
    "vignetting corrections were performed using the _ exsas / midas _ software package .",
    "we see the instrumental structure due to the ribs of the window support of the pspc which are seen only in a direction parallel to the direction of the telescope wobble .",
    "we found significant inhomogeneities in our fovs .",
    "they could not be explained with a simple blast wave model .",
    "there is a bright clump ( c1 ) at the pspc center ( @xmath10 ) with a radius of 2.@xmath117 ( @xmath1 0.6  pc ) where we guess that the blast wave is moving into a dense region and has stagnated .",
    "the region named c1 is the bright part of `` xa '' named in hc .",
    "the regions to the north and south of c1 seem to have lower density , which means that the blast wave goes ahead of c1 .",
    "there is another bright clump to the south of c1 which is the se blob .",
    "to the west of c1 , we see a bright arc structure which is the left portion of pos - er .    the lower panel of figure  [ fig : ana : east : pspc ] shows the surface brightness map obtained with the sis . comparing these two images",
    ", we notice that c1 , marked with a black circle , is not bright in the sis image .",
    "the bright regions in the asca energy band ( 0.5@xmath1210 kev ) are the northeast region of pos - er  and the southwestern region of pos - eu .",
    "the effective energy range of the pspc is 0.1@xmath122.4 kev while that of the sis is 0.5@xmath1210 kev .",
    "there is a big difference in the sensitivity below the c - k edge .",
    "therefore , possible interpretations of the discrepancies between the rosat and asca images are 1 ) the presence of a low @xmath0 component at c1 , 2 ) the presence of a high @xmath0 component at asca bright region , and/or 3 ) an extremely low @xmath13 around c1 .",
    "we constructed a band ratio map using the pspc data by dividing the 0.44@xmath122.0 kev band ( r3@xmath12r7 ) image by the 0.11@xmath120.28 kev band ( r1@xmath12r2 ) image , shown in figure  [ fig : ana : east : hardness ] .",
    "we clearly see a soft x - ray emitting region along the shock front in the fov .",
    "the softest region is at c1 in this figure , shown in white .",
    "we also found a soft x - ray emitting region around c1 as shown by a circle ( hereafter referred to as c2 ) . around c2 ,",
    "a hard x - ray emitting region extends and wraps around c2 where @xmath0 determined with the sis is also high as shown in figure  [ fig : ana : east : kt ] .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : ana : east : hardness ] , a spectral variation is seen in the pspc data .",
    "we analyzed the pspc spectra at various positions within the fov .",
    "we used xselect to extract the x - ray spectra , and used the response function pspcb_gain2_256.rmf for the spectral fits .",
    "the effective areas of the xrt were calculated by pcarf , which included vignetting effects .",
    "figure  [ fig : ana : east : hardness ] shows the five regions ( c1 , r1@xmath12r4 ) where spectra were extracted .",
    "the spectrum obtained for each region is shown in figure  [ fig : ana : east : pspcspec ] .",
    "the background spectrum was extracted from a blank region in the same data set .",
    "we clearly see strong soft x - ray emission below the c k - edge in all regions .",
    "this soft excess could account for the difference in the surface brightness maps between the rosat and asca energy bands .",
    "we extracted the sis spectra from the same region as the pspc ( c1 , r1@xmath12r4 ) and simultaneously fitted the pspc and sis spectra .",
    "we applied the nei model for these spectra .",
    "all parameters except the normalization were linked between the sis and pspc spectra .",
    "free parameters were @xmath0 , log(@xmath4 ) , abundances of o , ne , mg , si , and fe , @xmath13 , normalizations for both the sis spectra and the pspc spectra .",
    "we could not obtain statistically acceptable fits with a single component nei model . in all pspc spectra",
    ", we found excess emission below the c k - edge .",
    "we confirmed that such excess emission could not be reproduced with extremely low @xmath13 such as @xmath14 @xmath15 .",
    "we therefore added another component with a different @xmath0 to reproduce the low energy region of the spectra .",
    "the low @xmath0 component was mainly detected in the pspc energy band . due to the insufficient",
    "energy resolving power of the pspc , we could not determine the individual abundance of heavy elements and log(@xmath4 ) for the low @xmath0 component .",
    "we therefore assumed cosmic abundances and the condition of ionization equilibrium for the low @xmath0 component .",
    "we obtained acceptable fits for all regions .",
    "best fit curves are shown in figure  [ fig : ana : east : pspcspec ] and parameters are summarized in table [ east_fit_result ] and [ east_abundance ] .    including the rosat pspc ( c - band ) , we found a very low @xmath0 component .",
    "the asca sis is insensitive to such a low @xmath0 component .",
    "the @xmath0 values obtained for high @xmath0 components are similar in all regions and also similar to those obtained at the ne region ( mt ) .",
    "the values of log(@xmath4 ) are also similar in all regions whereas they are slightly higher than those in the ne region .",
    "since the @xmath0 value obtained for low @xmath0 component is extremely low , the major part of its emission is below the pspc band .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 value obtained might contain some uncertainties because we only observe a small fraction of the spectrum .",
    "moreover , the emissivity of such low-@xmath0 plasma is very large ( typically @xmath16 erg s@xmath3 @xmath17 for plasma with cosmic abundances ; gehrels & williams 1993 ) , resulting to quickly cool down to @xmath18 k. other narrow band studies , however , reveal the existence of such low @xmath0 plasma .",
    "images of [ ] and [ ] lines showed the existence of the cooler x - ray emitting plasma in the vicinity of the eastern region of the cygnus loop ( teske 1990 ; teske & kirshner 1985 ; ballet et al . 1984 ) .",
    "the image of the [ ] line showed bright filaments in the vicinity of c1 , r1 , and r2 regions ( szentgyorgyi et al .",
    "2000 ) whereas it did not cover other regions . as [ ] is a unique probe of plasma with @xmath19 k , we confirm that the extremely low @xmath0 component is surely present at c1 and r1 .",
    "we should note that the metal abundances are depleted at c1 and r4 while they are comparable to the cosmic values at r1 , r2 and r3 .",
    "this reminds us the spatial structure detected at the ne region of the cygnus loop . in the ne region , abundances of heavy elements are also depleted and shows an increase toward the inner region ( mt ) . at the shell , a radius of @xmath20 in the ne region where @xmath21 is the shock radius , they are constant ( 0.15@xmath10.3 times cosmic values ) , whereas , behind the shell , they are 20@xmath1230% larger than those obtained at the shell .",
    "therefore , abundances at c1 and r4 are consistent with those obtained at the shell whereas those obtained at r1 , r2 , and r3 are qualitatively consistent with those obtained behind the shell with considering the statistical errors .",
    "figure [ fig : dis : north : kt ] shows the spatial variations of @xmath0 and log(@xmath4 ) in the pos - nn . as shown in figure 1 , a v - shaped structure",
    "is clearly seen over the sis fov .",
    "values of @xmath0 at the v - shaped structure ( @xmath22 0.3 kev ) are lower than those in the neighboring region .",
    "this is consistent with results obtained with the rosat pspc ( decourchelle et al .",
    "there are three high @xmath0 regions marked in figure  [ fig : dis : north : kt ] .",
    "such inhomogeneities in the @xmath0 distribution can not be explained by a simple blast wave model .",
    "the spatial variation of log(@xmath4 ) shows an anti - correlation with that of @xmath0 .",
    "one of the most important purposes of observing the northern region is to compare the results with those of the fpcs ( vedder et al .",
    "the fpcs onboard the einstein observatory was the only available data with better energy resolution than ours and had a capability to resolve the triplet of ; forbidden ( 561 ev ) , inter - combination ( 569 ev ) , and resonance ( 574 ev ) lines .    to compare our results with those of the fpcs , we investigated the intensity of individual emission lines .",
    "we fitted the spectrum , extracted from the same region as vedder et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , with a thermal bremsstrahlung continuum and then added a gaussian line profile one by one until an acceptable fit was obtained ( combination model as mentioned in miyata et al 1998 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : ana : sis : north : bg ] shows the best fit curve and the residuals between the data and the model .",
    "an acceptable fit was obtained with a model that included 10 gaussian line profiles .",
    "the best fit @xmath0 and line intensity ratio of to values are kev and .    due to its insufficient energy resolution",
    ", the sis can not resolve the k@xmath23 line from the k@xmath24 line .",
    "we then calculated the line intensity ratio of the sum of k@xmath24 and to based on the table  1 in vedder et al .",
    "thus , the values obtained with the fpcs are @xmath25 0.3 kev and a line ratio of , respectively .",
    "the sis results fully agree with the fpcs results to within the statistical uncertainties .",
    "we therefore confirm the consistency between the sis and the fpcs .",
    "as mentioned in section 3 , a simple blast wave model is able to explain the inhomogeneities neither in the eastern nor in the northern regions . we need to introduce interstellar clouds into the model in order to account for the inhomogeneities .",
    "the interaction of the shock wave with the interstellar clouds results in three kinds of shock ; a shock traveling around the cloud , a shock transmitted into the cloud ( hereafter referred to as the transmission shock ) , and a shock reflected from the cloud ( hereafter referred to as the reflection shock ) .",
    "the nature of the interaction depends on the size and the density of the cloud .",
    "after the interaction , the reflection shock will propagate toward a direction opposite to the incident shock when the postincident shock flow is supersonic relative to the cloud .",
    "we assume radiation can be ignored and that the cloud is spherical . if the density contrast between the cloud and the ambient matter is not high enough to be treated as incompressive , some amount of energy will be released by the transmission shock , propagating into the cloud .    the physical properties of the transmission shock as well as the reflection shock depend on the density contrast , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the density of the cloud .",
    "sgro ( 1975 ) studied the interaction by considering the density contrast in the assumption of the strong shock limit for the blast wave ( mach number ( @xmath28 6 ) .",
    "he solved the fluid equations for the mass , momentum , and energy conservation across the discontinuity between the reflection shock and the transmission shock .",
    "the geometry of the interaction is shown in figure  [ fig : review : reflection : geometry ] .",
    "we denote by subscripts 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 the parameters of preshocked gas , postincident shocked gas , postreflected shocked gas , posttransmitted shocked gas , and incident cloud , respectively , as shown in this figure . across the discontinuity ,",
    "the pressure is constant , @xmath29 .",
    "when the postincident shock wave strikes the cloud , it would experience an overpressure relative to the ambient postincident shocked gas by a factor of @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath30 he found the following equations for temperature and velocity , with respect to the contact discontinuity , of both the reflection and transmission shock region as a function of postincident shocked parameters . @xmath31",
    "where @xmath32 is the density contrast between the postincident shocked gas and the postreflected shocked gas , @xmath33 , and can be related to @xmath23 through @xmath34 ^ 2 }       \\ \\ \\ .\\ ] ] figure  [ fig : dis : east : sgro ] shows the characteristics of the postreflected shocked region as a function of @xmath23 .",
    "this figure is consistent with figure 17 of hester et al .",
    "( 1994 ) even though their approach of calculation differs from ours .",
    "when the postincident shock wave strikes the cloud , it would experience an overpressure relative to the ambient postincident shocked gas by a factor of @xmath24 .",
    "values of temperature and velocity for the transmission shock can be determined by equations ( [ eq : review : reflection : preeq],[eq : review : reflection : param ] ) .",
    "the time required for the transmission shock to travel through the cloud is @xmath35 yr , where @xmath36 is the radius of the cloud in pc and @xmath37 is the velocity of the transmission shock in km s@xmath3 . by equating the cooling time of the posttransmitted shocked gas to the time required for the transmission shock to travel through the cloud , a critical cloud density , @xmath38 , is defined .",
    "sgro ( 1975 ) calculated @xmath38 and the cooling time , @xmath39 , of the posttransmitted shocked gas due to the radiation as @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the emissivity of thin thermal gas , which is approximately 1.33@xmath43 ergs @xmath17 s@xmath3 in the range of @xmath44 k.    for clouds with density greater than @xmath38 , the posttransmitted shocked gas cools rapidly and clouds begin to evaporate into a hot tenuous medium .",
    "note that @xmath24 depends on the density contrast , @xmath23 = @xmath38/@xmath45 , so that we should pay attention to calculate @xmath38 .",
    "figure  [ fig : dis : east : nc ] shows the maximum cloud radius which can be heated up by the blast wave .",
    "@xmath24 is calculated for each density contrast and @xmath46 is fixed to be 0.21 kev .",
    "this graph allows us to determine @xmath38 for a given @xmath45 and @xmath47 .",
    "after the cloud is surrounded by the tenuous medium , it will be gradually heated up due to thermal conduction .",
    "the thermal conductivity of a fully ionized hydrogen plasma is given by ( spitzer 1962 ) @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the coulomb logarithm which we set to @xmath49=30 since it is insensitive to @xmath50 and density .",
    "we set the differences in temperature between the cloud and the surrounding medium to be @xmath51 , so that the heat flux is @xmath52 the heat flux is proportional to @xmath53/@xmath54 , where @xmath53 is the mean free path for electron energy exchange and @xmath54 is the temperature scale height @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath53 is found from @xmath56    the classical model of thermal conductivity assumes that the mean free path , @xmath53 , is shorter than @xmath54 , which is a typical cloud size .",
    "however , for many situations of interest to our model , the mean free path of electrons is not shorter than the radius of the evaporating cloud . when @xmath53 becomes comparable to or greater than @xmath54 ,",
    "the heat flux is no longer equal to @xmath57 .",
    "this effect is referred to as saturation .",
    "cowie & mckee ( 1977 ) studied ` saturated ' thermal conduction in detail .",
    "as to the spherical cloud , the timescale for complete evaporation can be written by ( cowie & mckee 1977 ) @xmath58",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : ana : east : hardness ] , we found two soft x - ray bright regions in the eastern region ; c1 and c2 . inside c2 , we detected low @xmath0 components at every position ( c1 and r1@xmath12r4 ) . based on these results , we calculated the density of these regions .",
    "we assumed a homogeneous spherical cloud for c2 with a radius of 12  @xmath59 2.7  pc for the low @xmath0 components .",
    "the calculated volumes and densities are summarized in table  [ table : dis : east : pspcspec ] .",
    "if we assumed pressure balance between the low @xmath0 and high @xmath0 components , we could calculate the density and volume for the high @xmath0 components as shown in table [ table : dis : east : pspcspec ] .",
    "the obtained density for the low @xmath0 component is roughly 30 @xmath17 at every portion of the eastern region .",
    "the density for the high @xmath0 component is roughly 5 times higher than that obtained at the ne region as found in mt .",
    "we also calculated the thermal pressure at each region shown in table [ table : dis : east : pspcspec ] .",
    "hc estimated the thermal pressure at the `` xa''to be @xmath60 @xmath17 k , which is consistent with our results .      because a simple blast wave model can not explain the inhomogeneities of the eastern region , we investigate emission mechanism models which can hold for the overall x - ray features of the eastern region .",
    "we first consider an inhomogeneous ism .",
    "specifically , we consider an enhancement of the preshock density . to distinguish it from the interstellar cloud , we assume that the enhanced density is lower than @xmath38 . in this case , such an enhancement will be smoothed out by the blast wave , resulting in an enhancement of the x - ray emission .",
    "this could account for the bright x - ray appearance at the eastern region .",
    "based on this model , @xmath0 of the bright region is expected to be lower than those of neighboring regions .",
    "the high @xmath0 region can be considered as the postincident shocked region .",
    "this means that we can apply a simple blast wave model to the high @xmath0 region as a first order approximation .",
    "based on the sedov model ( sedov 1959 ) , @xmath0 just behind the blast wave is proportional to @xmath61 . for the high @xmath0 components ,",
    "@xmath62 is roughly 6 @xmath17 . assuming the strong shock limit , @xmath63 is calculated to be 1.5 @xmath17 .",
    "this value is roughly 6 times higher than that of the ne region ( mt ) .",
    "considering the @xmath0 value at the ne region , @xmath0 at the eastern region should be @xmath64 0.15  kev .",
    "this value is roughly two times lower than that obtained at c2 region as shown in table  [ table : dis : east : pspcspec ] .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 value obtained for the high @xmath0 component is too high to be explained using the simple blast wave model .",
    "thus , it seems difficult to explain the current bright x - ray features as resulting from a shocked region in which the density is higher than that of the neighboring region .",
    "we found region c2 to be bright in soft x - rays .",
    "as shown in table  [ table : dis : east : pspcspec ] , the density of this region is quite high compared with other regions ( 0.25 @xmath17 at the ne region ) .",
    "if we considered c2 as an interstellar cloud , cloud evaporation might play an important role in its high density .",
    "based on the cloud evaporation model , however , high @xmath0 components are considered as the emission from the postincident shocked region just as the same case of the previous model .",
    "thus , we met with a similar difficulty in trying to explain the x - ray properties by the cloud evaporation model .",
    "we next calculated the cooling time of the posttransmitted shocked gas . for clouds with density greater than @xmath38 ,",
    "the posttransmitted shocked gas rapidly cools down to @xmath65 k , and there is no x - ray emission . based on the equation ( [ eq : review : evapo : criticaldensity ] ) , we calculated the maximum cloud thickness , @xmath36 , to be heated by the transmission shock to emit x - rays . figure  [ fig : dis : east : nc ] shows the maximum cloud radius plotted as a function of @xmath23 and @xmath45 .",
    "vertical dashed lines show the permitted area for @xmath23 ( inferred in the subsequent subsection ) while horizontal solid lines show the permitted area for @xmath45 .",
    "this figure shows that the transmission shock wave will cool down to below the x - ray emitting temperature when it moves into a cloud roughly 0.02@xmath123 pc in size .",
    "this indicates that the transmission shock can heat up roughly half of c2 for which the radius is roughly 2.7 pc and it can not pass through c2 since it will cool down to below the x - ray emitting temperature .",
    "therefore , the cloud evaporation model can be ruled out as an explanation for the hard x - ray emitting gas , although it might account for the low-@xmath0 component for future observations .      as described in the previous section",
    ", three kinds of shock waves might occur when the blast wave interacts with the cloud .",
    "we suppose that the posttransmitted and the postreflected shocked regions correspond to the soft and hard x - ray regions , respectively , in case of the eastern region .",
    "the reflection shock propagates into the postincident shocked region and provides an additional heating .",
    "the transmission shock propagates into the high density cloud and heats it up to x - ray emitting temperatures if the density contrast between the cloud and the ambient matter is not too high , accounting for the bright x - rays seen in the rosat band .    based on this model , the ratio of @xmath0 for the postreflected shocked region to that for the posttransmitted shocked region depends on the density contrast . based on figure [ fig : dis : east : sgro ]",
    "we calculated the ratio for @xmath0 and @xmath66 between the postreflected shocked region and the posttransmitted shocked region , shown in figure  [ fig : dis : east : ratio ] .",
    "we also plotted our results in figure  [ fig : dis : east : ratio ] for c1 and r1@xmath12r4 .",
    "the density contrast , @xmath23 , can be determined based both on the @xmath0 ratios and the @xmath66 ratios as shown in table  [ table : dis : east : densitycontrast ] .",
    "we can obtain a consistent value of @xmath67 for all regions even though the statistical uncertainties are large for the @xmath66 ratios .",
    "therefore , based on the reflection shock model , we can quantitatively explain the observed values of @xmath0 for high and low @xmath0 components with an interstellar cloud for which the density is roughly an order of magnitude larger than that of the ambient medium .",
    "we can calculate the various physical parameters of the postreflected and posttransmitted shocked region based on figure  [ fig : dis : east : ratio ] .",
    "table  [ table : dis : east : densitycontrast ] shows values of @xmath68 (= @xmath69 ) and @xmath70 for each region .",
    "based on these results , @xmath66 and @xmath0 at the postreflected shocked region is roughly 1.8 and 1.5 times larger than those at the postincident shocked region",
    ". therefore , @xmath62 and @xmath0 at the postincident shocked region are @xmath1 2.8 @xmath17 and @xmath1 0.21  kev .",
    "this implies that @xmath45 at the eastern region is 0.7 @xmath17 .",
    "this value is roughly three times larger than the mean value ( ku et al .",
    "this might be a region of enhanced density , a ` tail ' of the cloud , extending around c2 as suggested by hc .",
    "if we compare this density with that obtained at the ne region , @xmath0 at the eastern region is found to be @xmath71 0.20  kev .",
    "this value is in good agreement with our result .",
    "thus , we conclude that the reflection shock and transmission shock can explain the x - ray properties observed both with rosat and with asca .",
    "it is interesting to note that the density contrast obtained at the eastern region is consistent with that obtained at the ne region ( mt ) . combining these results ,",
    "we suppose the existence of a large - scale high density region from the ne toward the eastern region of the cygnus loop .",
    "the x - ray image of the pos - nn  shows a peculiar v - shaped feature , as shown in figure  [ fig : ana : limb : image ] .",
    "this v - shaped region is the brightest among the regions with the same radius from the center .",
    "the @xmath0 distribution of the pos - nn  is not uniform as shown in figure  [ fig : dis : north : kt ] .",
    "we found that three regions showed @xmath0 ( 0.5@xmath120.6 kev ) higher than other regions ( 0.3@xmath120.4 kev ) .",
    "we refer to these three regions as h1@xmath12h3 as marked in figure  [ fig : dis : north : kt ] with green lines . comparing the surface brightness map with @xmath0 map",
    ", we noticed a strong anti - correlation between them .",
    "we centered our fov on the brightest part in the northern region which was about 20  inside the shock front .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ sec : dis : east : em ] , we expected that the brightest region was roughly 4  inside the shock front if we assumed the blast wave to be propagating into a homogeneous medium .",
    "the apparent structure of the pos - nn  is unlikely to be explained by such a simple blast wave model .    as mentioned in the previous section ,",
    "the pos - nn  is the brightest among the regions with the same radius from the center .",
    "one of the following two scenarios may explain the emission mechanism ; the high density medium may be like an interstellar cloud ( evaporation or reflection shock heating ) or the shock front structure may be due to a projection effect . in the subsequent section , we will investigate the possible explanation for the current x - ray features observed both with rosat and with asca .",
    "the mean @xmath0 around the v - shaped region is roughly 0.4  kev .",
    "it is similar to that obtained at the ne region ( mt ) .",
    "however , the surface brightness is much higher than regions with the same radius in the direction of the ne region .",
    "if the v - shaped region comes from the shock front due to a projection effect , the mean density of the pos - nn  must be higher assuming the pressure equilibrium .",
    "therefore , we can expect a lower @xmath0 than that of the ne region assuming the pressure equilibrium .",
    "however , we found @xmath0 to be similar to each other .",
    "we conclude that the bright x - ray appearance does not come from a projection effect of the shock front structures .",
    "we next investigate a cloud evaporation model .",
    "after the interstellar cloud is engulfed by the shock wave , it begins to evaporate when the cloud density is higher than the critical density for direct shock heating .",
    "the value of @xmath0 of the shocked cloud ( @xmath72 ) depends on the density contrast between the cloud and the ism .",
    "the value of @xmath72 must be lower than that of the postincident shocked region .",
    "assuming that the cloud is sitting at the center of our fov , we can expect bright x - ray emission from the cloud .",
    "this picture resembles our results at the point of 1 ) the bright and low @xmath73 emission at the center of our fov and 2 ) high @xmath0 emission at h2 ( and possibly h3 ) . generally speaking",
    ", the value of @xmath0 decreases toward the shock front where the density is the highest .",
    "therefore , h1 is considered as the postincident shocked region shocked by the blast wave passing over the cloud .",
    "we then investigated whether or not we could explain the x - ray feature of h1 by a model that included direct shock heating .",
    "the angular distance from the center of the cygnus loop to h1 is roughly 72 .",
    "the value of @xmath0 obtained at the region with the same radius in the direction of the ne region is roughly 0.4  kev ( mt ) .",
    "if such a high @xmath0 medium at h1 is the shock heated ism , we can estimate the density by using the sedov model . since @xmath0 of the shock wave is proportional to @xmath61 , @xmath45 of the pos - nn",
    "is expected to be @xmath74 @xmath17 .",
    "the surface brightness of h1 is lower by a factor of @xmath1 3 than that of the ne region , which is consistent with the low density derived above .",
    "however , based on a similarity solution , the shock radius is proportional to @xmath75 .",
    "the current location of the shock front passing over the cloud is expected to be ( 0.25/0.07)@xmath76 1.3 farther away from the center than that at the ne region .",
    "however , it is not the case as shown in figure  [ fig : ana : limb : image ]",
    ". therefore , it seems difficult to explain the current x - ray feature of h1 with the model of shock heating by the incident shock wave .",
    "therefore , even if we take into account not only a single cloud but also multiple clouds , we expect that the cloud evaporation model would be ruled out to explain the pos - nn .",
    "we found that neither the direct shock heating model nor the cloud evaporation model could account for the pos - nn   of the cygnus loop .",
    "we next consider the reflection shock heating model .",
    "there are several configurations for the location of the cloud . among them , we choose two favorable configurations as discussed in the subsequent sections .",
    "we first examine the case that a cloud exists at h1 .",
    "we can interpret the structure of the v - shaped region as the postreflected shocked region as shown in figure  [ fig : review : reflection : geometry ] .",
    "regions of h2 and h3 are expected to be the postincident shocked region . in this case",
    ", we expect @xmath0 at the v - shaped region to be higher than those of h2 and h3 . however , this is not the case .",
    "therefore , this is unlikely to be explained with the reflection shock model .",
    "the value of @xmath0 of h1 is much higher than those at other regions at the same angular distance from the center .",
    "such high @xmath0 is expected in the postreflected shocked region .",
    "if a cloud is at h1 , we will expect the emission from the cloud itself at h1 either in at soft x - ray or optical wavelengths .",
    "the value of @xmath0 of the posttransmitted shocked region depends on the density contrast . for a small density contrast",
    ", we expect that a low @xmath0 component is bright in the soft x - ray energy band ( rosat band ) . on the contrary , for the case of a high density contrast ,",
    "@xmath0 of the posttransmitted shocked region decreases so that there is no x - ray emission , so that we then expect some optical counterparts to be seen at the position of the cloud .",
    "based on the @xmath0 map obtained with the rosat all - sky survey ( aschenbach & leahy 1994 ) , @xmath0 at h1 region is higher than those at its neighboring regions .",
    "this will deny the existence of the soft x - ray emitting component .",
    "figure  [ fig : dis : north : optical ] shows the optical image of the pos - nn  of the cygnus loop which is a digital sky survey image retrieved from the skyview program , supported by heasarc / gsfc .",
    "there are some optical counterparts seen .",
    "however , we find no emission around the h1 region .",
    "therefore , we conclude that there is not a low @xmath0 component at regions neighboring h1 either in the soft x - ray region or at optical wavelengths .",
    "thus , this configuration can not explain either the low @xmath0 of the v - shaped region or the lack of low @xmath0 component at h1 .",
    "we next consider a cloud at the center of our fov .",
    "after the interaction between the blast wave and the cloud , the blast wave passes over the cloud .",
    "the reflection shock propagates into the postincident shocked region while the transmission shock propagates into the cloud .",
    "the current geometry we suppose for the pos - nn  is schematically shown in figure  [ fig : dis : north : geometry ] .    in this configuration , we directly observe the postreflected shocked region with a higher @xmath0 among the neighboring mediums at two different regions . between these two regions ,",
    "we observe the overlapping of a postreflected shocked region and a posttransmitted shocked region . because the density of both regions is high ,",
    "we expect substantially bright x - ray emission at the overlapping region .",
    "the value of @xmath0 at the overlapping region is intermediate between the low @xmath0 ( k@xmath77 ) the high @xmath73 ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "if we apply this configuration to our data , we suppose that h1@xmath12h3 come from the postreflected shocked region as marked by upper and lower broken lines . between h1 and h2",
    ", the bright v - shaped region can be interpreted as the overlapping region .",
    "therefore , we favor this picture since this picture can explain both the high x - ray surface brightness seen at the center of the pos - nn  obtained with rosat and the @xmath0 distribution determined with the asca sis .",
    "we extracted spectra at h1@xmath12h3 regions and fitted them with a single component nei model .",
    "however , we failed to fit them with a single component model . as shown in figure 7",
    "there are still spectral variations in each region , possibly because there are some amount of contamination from the low-@xmath0 component and also the model we proposed is too much simplified .",
    "however , we believe the overall plasma structure can be explained with the current configuration .",
    "we estimate other physical parameters based on this model assuming a spherical cloud .",
    "the separation between h1 and h2 roughly corresponds to the diameter of the cloud .",
    "the cloud is then at ( @xmath79 ) with a radius of roughly 7@xmath80 1.6  pc .",
    "the values obtained for @xmath0 at h1@xmath12h3 are considered as @xmath81 whereas that of v - shaped region ( @xmath1 0.4 kev ) stands for the mean value of @xmath81 and @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , we extracted the x - ray spectrum at the v - shaped region and fitted it with a two component nei model with different @xmath0 .",
    "the values obtained for @xmath0 are @xmath1 0.2 and @xmath1 0.5 kev .",
    "the value of the high @xmath0 component agrees reasonably with that obtained at h1@xmath12h3 .",
    "thus , @xmath77 can be considered as @xmath22 0.2 kev .",
    "the ratio of @xmath81 to @xmath77 depends on the density contrast as discussed in section 4 .",
    "based on figure  [ fig : dis : east : ratio ] , we obtain the density contrast @xmath23 to be @xmath59 5 .",
    "the cloud density is estimated to be roughly 1 @xmath17 assuming the ambient density of 0.2 @xmath17 . for @xmath82",
    ", we obtain @xmath0 of postincident shocked region @xmath46 of 0.45  kev and @xmath24=2 .",
    "@xmath46 obtained is similar to that of the region with the same angular distance from the center to the direction of the ne region .",
    "figure  [ fig : dis : north : radius ] shows the maximum radius of the cloud which can be heated up directly by the shock wave , in the @xmath83 plane .",
    "the vertical solid line represents the value of @xmath23 at the pos - nn  region .",
    "as shown in this figure , the cloud with size of @xmath84 1.6 pc will be destroyed by the blast wave with @xmath85 kev . on the contrary ,",
    "the value of @xmath86 we obtained is 0.45 kev .",
    "such a cloud can not survive during passage of the blast wave . therefore , we can rule out the cloud evaporation model to explain the bright x - ray features seen at pos - nn .    in this way",
    ", the reflection shock model can well explain the observed x - ray features with a simple geometry as shown in figure  [ fig : dis : north : geometry ] .",
    "we have performed high quality x - ray observations of the cygnus loop using the asca observatory and the rosat observatory . we have found that the x - ray surface brightness and @xmath0 significantly vary inside our fov .",
    "they can not be explained with a simple blast wave model .",
    "we carried out calculations for the interaction between the blast wave and the interstellar cloud in order to determine the characteristics of the postincident shocked gas , the posttransmitted shocked gas , and the reflection shocked gas .",
    "we applied the evaporation model as well as the reflection ( and transmission ) shock model for the eastern and the northern regions .",
    "we have difficulties explaining the x - ray nature with the evaporation model for both regions .",
    "only the reflection shock model can quantitatively explain the observed @xmath0 and the x - ray surface brightness .",
    "the cloud size is difficult to estimate .",
    "however , it is at least 1 pc in size for both regions .",
    "such a large cloud is sitting in the ne region as well ( mt ) . combining all of these results ,",
    "we conclude that a cloud of large scale is covering at least one third of the cygnus loop .",
    "this fact strongly supports the existence of a pre - existing cavity wall , possibly created by the precursor .",
