    "multipe - quantum ( mq ) nmr spin dynamics in solids @xcite is a powerful tool for the investigation of structure and dynamical processes in solids , counting the number of spins in impurity clusters @xcite and the simplification of ordinary nmr spectra @xcite .",
    "although mq nmr was successful in a lot of applications and experimental methods of mq nmr have been developed adequately , the theoretical interpretation of many - spin mq nmr dynamics is restricted by the phenomenological approach @xcite .",
    "a systematic quantum - mechanical approach was developed @xcite only for one - dimensional systems in the approximation of nearest neighbor dipolar interactions . up to now the thermodynamic equilibrium density matrix in a strong external magnetic field",
    "has been considered as the initial condition for these experiments and theoretical interpretations .",
    "recently , it has been suggested @xcite to consider the dipolar ordered state as the initial state for such experiments .",
    "it is well known that the dipolar ordered state can be prepared using the method of adiabatic demagnetization in a rotating frame ( adrf ) @xcite or with the jeener - broekaert ( jb ) two - pulse sequence @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the spin system contains mq coherences immediately following the second pulse of the jb pulse sequence @xcite . by encoding the coherence numbers in an orthogonal basis ( the @xmath0-basis )",
    ", it was shown that the dipolar ordered state is a two - spin correlated one @xcite .",
    "as a result of using the dipolar ordered initial condition , many - spin clusters and correlations appear faster than in the ordinary mq nmr experiments in solids @xcite and some peculiarities of mq dynamics can be investigated with these experiments .",
    "of course , it is necessary to make some changes in the scheme of the standard experiment in order to obtain non - zero signals of mq coherences .    in the present article we consider mq nmr dynamics when the initial condition is determined by the dipolar ordered state .",
    "our motivation of performance of this work is defined first of all by that the many - spin correlations are created faster in such experiments and can be used for the investigation of many - spin dynamics of nuclear spins in solids.we consider peculiarities of mq nmr in systems prepared in the dipolar ordered states in section ii .",
    "two methods of mq nmr for the systems in the dipolar ordered states are presented in sections iii and  iv .",
    "the method of section iii is based on the measurement of the dipolar temperature of the quasi - equilibrium state which establishes after the time @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the dipolar local field ) after the mq nmr experiment .",
    "the method of section iv is a simple modification of the usual mq nmr experiment @xcite .",
    "the additional @xmath3-pulse after the preparation period allows the observation of a non - zero signal as in the usual mq nmr experiments .",
    "computer simulations of such experiments for linear chains containing up to eight spins are presented in section v.",
    "we consider a system of nuclear spins ( @xmath4 ) coupled by the dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) in a strong external magnetic field .",
    "the secular part of the ddi hamiltonian @xcite has the following form @xmath5   , \\tag{1}%\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the coupling constant between spins @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath10 is the distance between spins @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath11 is the angle between the internuclear vector @xmath12 and the external magnetic field @xmath13 which is directed along the axis @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 is the projection of the angular spin momentum operator on the axis @xmath16 ; @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the raising and lowering operators of spin  @xmath7 .",
    "the basic scheme of the standard mq nmr experiments consists of four distinct periods of time ( fig.1a ) : preparation @xmath19 , evolution @xmath20 , mixing @xmath19 and detection @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "mq coherences are created by the multipulse sequence consisting of eight - pulse cycles on the preparation period  @xcite . in the rotating reference frame ( rrf )",
    "@xcite the average hamiltonian describing the mq dynamics at the preparation period can be written as @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "then the evolution period without any pulses follows .",
    "the transfer of the information about mq coherences to the observable magnetization occurs during the mixing period .",
    "the density matrix of the spin system , @xmath24 , at the end of the preparation period is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the evolution operator on the preparation period and @xmath27 is the initial density matrix of the system . on the mixing period",
    "the spin system is irradiated with sequence of the pulses shifted on a @xmath28phase regarding the pulses of the preparation period . as a result",
    "the average hamiltonian describing evolution of the spin system on the mixing period changes a sign on opposite to the sign of the hamiltonian ( 2 ) , and the evolution operator , @xmath29 is replaced by the operator @xmath30  usually the thermodynamical equilibrium density matrix is used as the initial one for mq nmr experiments . here",
    "we consider mq nmr dynamics with the initial dipolar ordered state when the hamiltonian of the system is determined by eq .",
    "then the equilibrium state can be described as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the inverse spin temperature , the partition function @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the number of spins in the system .",
    "the high temperature approximation is taken into account in eq .",
    "the dipolar ordered state of the spin system can be reached by using the method of adiabatic demagnetization in a rotating frame ( adrf ) @xcite or by applying a pair of phase - shifted radiofrequency ( rf)-pulses ( the jeener - brokaert ( jb ) method ) @xcite .",
    "it is evident that the unit operator in eq .",
    "( 4 ) is not significant for the time evolution of the density matrix .",
    "for simplicity we will take @xmath35 as the initial condition .",
    "the use of the dipolar ordered state as the initial condition in mq nmr experiments leads to the emergence of spin clusters with a greater number of spins faster than in the standard method .",
    "it is well known @xcite that nmr methods in solids use both the zeeman equilibrium state and the dipolar ordered one as the initial conditions . here the developed methods together with the standard one @xcite yield analogous possibilities for mq nmr spectroscopy .",
    "below we describe two different methods of mq nmr of the dipolar ordered systems .",
    "starting with the initial condition ( 5 ) , the density matrix , @xmath36 , after the three periods of the standard mq nmr experiment ( fig.1a ) can be written as @xmath37 where @xmath24  is the density matrix at the end of the preparation period according to eq .",
    "( 3 ) and @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the frequency offset on the evolution period of the duration @xmath40 which is a result of applying the time proportional phase incrementation ( tppi ) method @xcite .",
    "the last unitary transformation in ( 6 ) with operator @xmath41  describes the mixing period .",
    "then the evolution of the system in the rrf is governed by the hamiltonian @xmath42 of eq .",
    "( 1 ) and after the time @xmath43 @xmath44 the system achieves the two - temperature quasi - equilibrium state with the density matrix @xmath45 , @xmath46 where the inverse temperatures , @xmath16 and @xmath32 , can be found from the conservation laws : @xmath47 applying the unitary transformation @xmath48 to the expression @xmath49 one can obtain from eq .",
    "( 8) that @xmath50 .",
    "it means that the quasi - equilibrium state of eq .",
    "( 7 ) is the dipolar ordered state .",
    "it is convenient to expand the density matrix , @xmath24 , at the end of the preparation period of the mq nmr experiment ( fig .",
    "1a ) with the initial condition ( 5 ) as @xcite @xmath51 where the term @xmath52 is responsible for the mq coherence of the @xmath53-th order .",
    "one can find @xmath54 by using eqs .",
    "( 8)-(10 ) one can rewrite the temperature @xmath32 as @xmath55 where the intensities of mq coherences @xmath56    the temperature @xmath32 can be measured using the magnetization component which is in phase with the exciting rf - pulse @xcite .",
    "different frequency components of the temperature @xmath32 yield mq coherences of different orders .",
    "in the previous section we showed that at the initial condition of eq .",
    "( 5 ) the standard scheme of mq nmr experiments does not lead to any observable magnetization . in order to overcome this problem we introduce a @xmath57-pulse turning spins around the axis @xmath58 by the angle @xmath59 after the preparation period ( fig .",
    "1b ) . then starting with @xmath60 , after the mixing period ( fig .",
    "1b ) the longitudinal magnetization , @xmath61 , is @xmath62 where the density matrix after the three periods of the modified mq nmr pulse sequence ( fig .",
    "1b ) can be written as @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the density matrix just after the @xmath57-pulse  ( fig .",
    "1b ) @xmath65 it is worth to notice that here the tppi method @xcite is applied in the mixing period in contrast to the method of section iii when it was applied in the preparation period of the mq nmr experiment . using eqs .",
    "( 14 ) and ( 15 ) and the initial condition ( 5 ) it is convenient to present the formula ( 13 ) for the longitudinal magnetization , @xmath66  as follows@xmath67 where @xmath68 coincides with the density matrix at the end of the preparation period of the  standard mq nmr experiment with the thermodynamical equilibrium density matrix as the initial condition @xcite .",
    "the density matrix @xmath69 can be represented in the following form @xcite @xmath70 where again the term @xmath71 is responsible for the mq coherence of the @xmath53-th order and satisfies to the relationship of eq .",
    "( 10 ) . by using eqs .",
    "( 10 ) , ( 17 ) , and ( 18 ) one can rewrite the expression for the observable signal in terms of the intensities of mq coherences @xmath72 where @xmath73 and the longitudinal magnetization , @xmath74 , is always real .",
    "thus , one can find from eq.(19 ) that @xmath75 one can notice that @xmath76 by applying a @xmath77-rotation around the @xmath58-axis to all operators in eq .",
    "it follows immediately from eqs .",
    "( 19 ) and ( 22 ) that @xmath78 it is evident that with the method of section iii @xmath79 , and the longitudinal magnetization , @xmath74 , is determined as @xmath80 by using the modified pulse sequence ( fig .",
    "1b ) the longitudinal magnetization can be expressed as @xmath81 thus the phases of the mq nmr coherences in the modified mq nmr pulse excitation scheme are shifted by @xmath82 from the phases in standard mq nmr @xcite .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( 23 ) that the intensity of the mq coherence of the zeroth order , @xmath83 , is equal to zero in the considered experiments .",
    "it is well - known that in the usual mq nmr experiments the sum of the intensities of all mq coherences does not depend on time @xcite .",
    "this is also right for the method described in section iii .",
    "here this law has a specific form . according to eq .",
    "( 23 ) the sum of intensities of orders @xmath53 and @xmath84 is equal to zero for all @xmath53 . thus , the sum of the intensities of all mq coherences equals zero .",
    "we restrict ourself to numerical simulations of mq nmr dynamics of one - dimensional systems .",
    "for example , quasi - one - dimensional hydroxyl proton chains in calcium hydroxyapatite @xmath85 @xcite and fluorine chains in calcium fluorapatite@xmath86 @xcite are suitable objects to study mq dynamics in dipolar ordered systems.the numerical calculations were performed with the methods of sections iii , iv for mq nmr dynamics of linear chains of 6 and 8 spins .",
    "the ddi coupling constant of the nearest neighbors is chosen to be @xmath87 .",
    "then the coupling constant of spins @xmath7 and @xmath8 is @xmath88 . in order to compare the results of the numerical simulations with the analogous ones for the ordinary mq nmr dynamics we introduce the normalized intensities of mq coherences for the method of section iv , @xmath89 .",
    "the dependence of the intensities of mq coherences on the dimensionless time , @xmath90 , of the preparation period in spin chains containing six and eight spins is presented in figs . 2 and 3 for the both methods of sections iii and sections iv .",
    "one can compare the intensities of mq coherences in the suggested experiments with the standard ones ( see figs . 2 and 3 ) .",
    "it is evident that the suggested methods can be considered as a useful addition to the standard mq nmr methods .",
    "comparison of the suggested methods of mq nmr of the systems in the dipolar ordered state is given in fig . 2 for mq coherences of the second and fourth orders .",
    "one can see ( figs .",
    "2a , 2b ) that the method of section iii is more preferable for experimental realizations in some cases .",
    "2a demonstrates that the method of section iii yields the intensities of mq coherences of the fourth order which several times higher than the analogous coherence in the standard mq nmr experiment .",
    "it is clear from the inset of fig .",
    "3a that mq coherence of the sixth order , obtained with the method of section iv , appears little earlier than in the usual mq nmr in a linear chain of six spins .",
    "at the same time , the intensity of this mq coherence obtained with the method of section iii is equal zero .",
    "in fact , the both methods supplement each other at the study of mq nmr dynamics .",
    "a tendency of the faster growth of mq coherences of high orders takes place for the linear chain containing eight spins ( fig .",
    "this peculiarity is connected with the initial dipolar ordered state , @xmath60 . as a result",
    ", many - spin clusters and connected with them mq coherences appear faster than in the standard mq nmr with the initial condition , @xmath91 .",
    "the numerical calculations confirm also the results obtained in the previous section .",
    "in particular , the growth of mq coherences ( for the method of section iv ) occurs in accordance with eq .",
    "( 23 ) and @xmath92 .",
    "one can see from figs . 2 and 3 and eq .",
    "( 23 ) that the observable intensities can be negative in contrast to the ordinary mq nmr experiments at high temperatures @xcite . at the same time",
    ", it was shown @xcite that the intensities of mq coherences can be negative in the standard nmr experiments at low temperatures .",
    "it is a terminological problem only .",
    "in fact , in mq nmr experiments the observable is the longitudinal magnetization modulated by rf pulses .",
    "the distinct frequency components of the magnetization can have an arbitrary sign @xcite .",
    "the mq nmr methods for the detection of mq coherences starting from the dipolar ordered state are proposed .",
    "the first method is based on the quasi - equilibrium state which establishes after the time @xmath93 after the mq nmr experiment .",
    "this state is the dipolar ordered one and its temperature is a source of information about mq nmr dynamics . in order to observe a non - zero signal of mq coherences in the second method",
    "an additional resonance @xmath94-pulse should be applied after the preparation period of the standard mq nmr experiment in solids .",
    "investigations of mq nmr dynamics in the dipolar ordered states can be considered as a supplementary method which complements the usual nmr in order to study structures and dynamical processes in solids .",
    "many - spin clusters and many - spin correlations are created faster in such experiments than in the usual mq nmr with the initial condition without any correlation between the spins .",
    "this paper focuses on simple one - dimensional examples but the physical picture obtained here is not limited to the performed simulations and experiments and opens new possibilities for the study of many - spin systems .",
