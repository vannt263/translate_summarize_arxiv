    "the effects of humidity and capillary attractive forces due to liquid bridges has a huge impact for practical applications as grains are often not dry in many industrial processes , e.g. when granulates are stored in open air and atmospheric humidity plays a role @xcite , and natural systems , e.g. soil @xcite .",
    "a number of studies have focused on the dynamics of wet granular avalanches ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and on the effect of humidity @xcite and capillary forces @xcite on the static properties of granulates .",
    "a number of different models have been proposed to study the geometric stability of wet piles , including mohr - coulomb continuum @xcite , liquid - bridge @xcite and response function @xcite models .    while invaluable in shedding light into the properties of wet granulates , natural systems often include a number of additional forcing factors that might significantly affect the stability of granulates in the environment . in geological systems ,",
    "instability is triggered by a combination of body forces ( e.g. gravity ) and hydrodynamic shearing due to the creeping motion of a fluid through a ( often saturated ) cohesive granulate .",
    "this is especially true in processes such as cliffs instability and landslides , where a fluidization event is triggered after heavy rainfall , sediment transport in submerged environments ( e.g. seafloor transport ) , fluidization of fines in fractures during pumping operations or oil recovery , just to mention a few .",
    "therefore , the understanding of how hydrodynamic forces affect the stability of granular matter is of utmost importance to better quantify the processes that trigger a fluidization event in submerged granular cohesive systems . moreover",
    ", structural properties of cohesive piles , such as porosity , can have a dramatic impact on their stability @xcite .    in the present work we use a multi - scale framework to quantify the effect of hydrodynamic forces on the onset of instability ( i.e. fluidization ) of a pile constituted of cohesive ( e.g. oil - wet ) grains in a planar fracture . on one hand ,",
    "a continuum - scale model is used to calculate the average hydrodynamic drag exerted on the grains ; on the other , a pore - scale network model allows us to calculate the force chains propagating through the pile and to analytically identify the location of failure and the fuidization threshold of regular packing structures for mono - disperse frictionless spherical grains .",

    "we introduce a continuum - scale darcy - brinkmann model for the flow and the hydrodynamic force exerted from the creeping fluid on the granulate @xcite .",
    "such model treats the wet granulate as porous medium .",
    "therefore , the average drag force exerted on each layer of the pile can be calculated from continuum - scale equations . section  [ sec : pore - scale - model ] discusses a pore - scale network model for the force propagation through the pile .",
    "location of failure , maximum load and fluidization threshold are analytically derived .",
    "finally , the stability criterion is formulated in terms of the capillary number , that represents the relative strength between destabilising hydrodynamic shear and stabilising capillary ( cohesive ) forces , and the packing orientation relative to the average flow direction .",
