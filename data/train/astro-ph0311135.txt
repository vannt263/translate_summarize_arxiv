    "microlensing experiments are an ideal method to search for dark objects within and between galaxies . a large number of microlensing events have been detected towards the galactic bulge constraining the number density of faint stars in this direction @xcite . towards the lmc",
    "only 13 - 17 microlensing events have been reported so far @xcite .",
    "if all this events are attributed to @xmath9 machos , the associated population of dark objects would contribute up to the 20% level to the dark matter content of the milky way @xcite .",
    "however , both the relatively large size of the lmc relative to its distance and the nature of the lenses has cast doubt on this interpretation .",
    "it is indeed likely that a large fraction of the microlensing events towards the lmc are due to self - lensing of stars within the lmc ( @xcite and references therein ) .    studying microlensing events towards m31 allows to separate self - lensing and halo - lensing in a statistical way , since the optical depth for halo lensing is larger on the far side of m31 . in m31 individual stars",
    "can not be resolved and one therefore has to use the pixellensing technique @xcite to follow the variability of sources blended with thousands of other sources within the same pixel .",
    "first detections of possible microlensing events were reported by several pixellensing experiments @xcite .",
    "but since the candidate nature of only 5 of these events is convincing , no conclusions concerning the near - far asymmetry or the most likely dark matter lensing masses could be drawn yet .",
    "the wendelstein calar alto pixellensing project ( wecapp , @xcite ) started in 1997 with test observations .",
    "since 1999 the bulge of m31 was monitored continuously during the time of visibility of m31 .",
    "the analysis of our 4 year data will allow not only the identification of very short duration events ( eg . , in the 4@xmath10 year data of the combined field have been taken on 83 % of possible nights ) but also the separation of long duration ( @xmath11 ) microlensing events from long periodic variables as mira stars .",
    "for this letter we analyzed the short duration events ( @xmath12 ) within one season of calar alto data and restricted the detection to high - signal - to noise , high - magnification events .",
    "we report our first 2 microlensing candidates of that type .",
    "wecapp monitors the central region of m31 in a @xmath13 field with the @xmath14 telescope of the calar alto observatory .",
    "in addition , a quarter of this field , pointing towards the far side of the m31 disk along the se minor axis , was observed with the 0.8  m telescope of the wendelstein observatory .",
    "the data analysis and candidate selection reported in this letter is based on the season from june , 23th 2000 to february , 25th 2001 and is restricted to the calar alto data only . during this period ,",
    "m31 was observed during 43% percent of all nights .",
    "observations were carried out in @xmath15 and @xmath16 filters close to the kron - cousins system .",
    "we estimate the systematic error in the @xmath17 color to be @xmath18 .",
    "we have developed a pipeline based on @xcite and @xcite , which performs the standard ccd reduction , position alignment , photometric alignment , stacking of frames , psf matching using optical image subtraction @xcite , and the generation of difference images . for the data presented here all data within one night",
    "are coadded , yielding one difference image per night .",
    "the reduction package includes full error propagation for each pixel through all reduction steps . in this way ,",
    "all data points are properly taken into account in the search for variables .",
    "lr analyzed light curves & 4492250 + light curves with @xmath19 data points & 3835407 + 3 successive 3-@xmath20 in @xmath15 or @xmath16 & 517052 + @xmath21 and @xmath22 & 186039 + 1 day @xmath23 days & 9497 + 3-@xmath20 light point inside @xmath24 & 1829 + sampling : @xmath25 , @xmath26 & 256 + @xmath27 in @xmath15 and @xmath16 & 15 + candidates & 2 +    we investigate only pixels which have more than 10 data points in @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which applies for 85% of the 2k x 2k field . for each pixel",
    "we define a flux baseline by iterative @xmath28-clipping of all outliers with higher flux .",
    "all pixels which have at least 3 successive ( positive ) 3-@xmath20 deviations from this baseline are considered as variables .",
    "we fit the microlensing light curve for high - amplification events @xcite simultaneously to the @xmath15- and @xmath16-band pixel light curves for every variable .",
    "the fit has 6 free parameters : full - width - half - maximum @xmath24 and the time @xmath29 of maximum amplification ( these 2 parameters are the same for both filters ) , amplitude @xmath30 , color @xmath31 , and baseline levels @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "variables with a reduced @xmath34 or @xmath35 are discarded . in this way",
    "we exclude light curves that are not achromatic or not symmetric .",
    "we also exclude events with @xmath36 days which can be confused with long periodic variables like mira stars , as long as only one season of data is investigated .",
    "in addition , all candidates which do not have at least one significant data point ( 3 @xmath20 deviation from the baseline ) within @xmath24 of the time of maximum amplification are rejected .",
    "we further define the sampling quality for the falling and rising parts of each light curve within @xmath37 and @xmath38 : within these time intervals we require a sampling of the area under the light curve of at least 20% on one side and of at least 5% on the other side ( table [ sel ] ) .    here",
    ", we present only the two microlensing candidates which have amplitudes 10 times larger than the median error of the light curve ( see figure [ gl ] ) .",
    "both candidates fit perfectly to a symmetric microlensing light curve . ruling out systematic offsets for the points and errors on the trailing side of gl2 ( which is strongly proved by the 6 single images of that night in each filter )",
    "a non microlensing light curve of a variable source hardly fits the data points of gl2 .",
    "both microlensing candidates are detected in several pixels ( @xmath39 for gl1 and @xmath40 for gl2 ) inside the psf of the position of the lensed object .",
    "this explains the reduction from 15 events to 2 events in the last line of table [ sel ] .",
    "the amplification light curves were obtained by calculating the total flux within the psf area of each microlensing event .    for both candidates ,",
    "the selection criteria exclude variable stars like miras , novae or dwarf novae .",
    "extracting lensing events with less good time sampling , lower amplitude , or events located close to other variables requires refined selection criteria .",
    "these will be discussed in a future paper which will also include a test of the detection efficiency and false detection rate with monte carlo simulations .",

    "gl1 , the highest s / n lensing event candidate in our sample , lies @xmath64 to the sw of the nucleus of m31 .",
    "gl2 is @xmath65 to the nw of the nucleus .",
    "our data have been astrometrically calibrated using bright foreground stars observed with hst by @xcite and ground based observations by @xcite .",
    "our two calibrations agree within 0.5@xmath66 in declination and 0.7@xmath66 in right ascension , well consistent with the astrometric accuracy of 0.8@xmath66 to 1.0@xmath66 of the magnier et al .  catalog .",
    "after we had detected gl1 and gl2 , we cross - checked with events reported by the point - agape survey for the same period of time and the same field in m31 @xcite .",
    "it appears that gl1 is likely identical with pa-00-s3 which occurred at the same time ( figure [ gl ] ) .",
    "because point - agape did not provide a flux calibration of their data , we had to assume a scaling factor for the amplitude .",
    "the zero point in time was not adjusted .",
    "the data points from wecapp and point - agape complement each other nicely and make gl1 the best pixellensing event found so far in m31 .",
    "gl2 also falls in the observing period covered by point - agape but their time sampling around the event is poor .",
    "this may be the reason why gl2 was not detected .",
    "the parameters of the lensing fit are degenerate for high magnifications @xcite , i.e. for amplitudes @xmath67 which correspond to impact angles much smaller than the einstein angle @xmath68 . in this case",

    "we evidently need to know the source flux @xmath70 .",
    "we can get rough constraints by considering the color of the light curves which due to our selection criteria are achromatic .",
    "we obtain @xmath74 and @xmath75 . for main sequence stars",
    "this converts @xcite into absolute magnitudes of @xmath76 . if the sources are giants , then the magnitudes are @xmath4 with a minimum of @xmath77 and maximum of @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "we now derive the lensing parameters as follows : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the einstein timescale , @xmath81 is the transverse velocity between source and lens , and @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the angular distances to the lens and source .",

    "the corresponding lens masses ( for @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 ) are @xmath104 , an implausibly large value . if the source is a giant , the required magnifications are reduced to @xmath105 and @xmath106 ( see table [ amplifications ] ) ; the typical self - lensing masses become @xmath107 and @xmath108 , i.e. they are typical for low mass stars .    assuming the source to be a red giant with @xmath4 we calculate the probability @xmath109 that a microlensing event of observed timescale @xmath110 can be produced by a lens of the mass @xmath111 . following the calculations of @xcite eq .",
    "( 8) and @xcite eq .",
    "( 11 ) we get @xmath112 with the mass function ( mf ) @xmath113 , the sources density @xmath114 , the lenses density @xmath115 , the velocity distribution @xmath116 and the einstein radius @xmath117 .    the distribution of matter in the central part of m31 is based on the bulge model of @xcite .",
    "the disk is modeled with a radial scale length of 6.4 kpc and an exponential shape , and with a vertical scale length of 0.3 kpc and a @xmath118-shape .",
    "the halo is modeled as an isothermal sphere with a core radius of @xmath119 .",
    "the velocity distribution was calculated from a maxwellian halo bulge and disk velocity distribution with an additional rotation for bulge and disk @xcite .    for the bulge lenses we take the imf as derived for the galactic bulge @xmath120 @xcite . for the disk population",
    "we adopt a gould imf @xmath121 with a flattening @xmath122 below @xmath123 @xcite .",
    "both are cut at the lower end at the hydrogen burning limit of @xmath7 . at the upper end",
    "the bulge mf is cut at the main sequence turn - off @xmath124 ( maraston , priv . com . ) and the disk mf at @xmath125 .",
    "the imf for the potential macho population residing in the halo of m31 is of course unknown .",
    "we therefore calculate the probability distribution for halos consisting of one mass only , i.e.  taking @xmath126-function imf s centered on the lens mass @xmath127 .",
    "moreover we assume that the whole dark halo of m31 consists of machos .",
    "lensing by galactic halo objects has an order of magnitude smaller optical depth and is therefore neglected in our considerations .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ masses ] . for m31 halo lenses the most probable masses are @xmath7 for gl1 and @xmath8 for gl2 . in the case of self - lensing",
    "the most probable masses are about a factor of 4 bigger . taking the most likely halo lens masses",
    ", the ratio of the probabilities that the lenses are part of the dark halo or the stellar content @xmath128 is 1.6 for gl1 and 3.3 for gl2 .",
    "we conclude therefore that it is likely that lenses residing in the halo of m31 caused the events in both cases .",
    "we presented the first two high ( @xmath129 ) , short timescale microlensing events from wecapp .",
    "gl1 is likely identical to pa-00-s3 found by point - agape . combining the data from agape with ours",
    "shows that the error bar of the derived einstein time scale becomes smaller by a factor of 5 compared to the individual error bar .",
    "this demonstrates the importance of a good time sampling of the events .",
    "we derived the colors of the lensed stars , the amplification factors and likely lens masses for both bulge / disk self - lensing and macho lensing .",
    "we showed that red giants are the likely source objects , while main sequence stars are highly implausible .",
    "self - lensing in the bulge can only be separated from macho lensing statistically .",
    "halo - lensing events show a spatial asymmetry because the optical depth for lensing events is higher for stars on the far side of m31 than on its near side @xcite .",
    "in contrast , bulge self - lensing is symmetric .    the bulge self - lensing hypothesis yields lensing stars at or below the the main sequence turn - off of the m31 bulge .",
    "on the other hand , if the lensing events are caused by machos , their masses are typically very low , most probable below @xmath130 .",
    "masses in the range of @xmath9 to @xmath131 are more unlikely .",
    "so far , we have analyzed one observing season and restricted the lensing search to short - time , high - amplification events in order to avoid confusion with variable stars .",
    "the whole wecapp dataset will allow us to identify all variables and thus will enable a search for lower amplitude and longer duration microlensing events .",
    "decreasing the amplitude threshold will increase the detected rate of events in two ways . as the event rate is proportional to the inverse of the minimum required magnification @xmath132 in the pixellensing regime we expect to detect more lensed giants . on the other hand lowering the amplification threshold could make it possible to detect also highly amplified main sequence stars @xcite which exceed the evolved stars in the bulge of m31 by a factor of more than a hundred .",
    "how many more lensing events will be detected depends on the mass function of the lenses but we can expect at least a factor of a few @xcite .    finally , the effects of time sampling and noise properties of our sample on the detectability of lensing events have to be taken into account .",
    "results of the modeling of these effects for events of different durations and amplitudes using monte - carlo simulations will be presented in a future publication . with the full dataset",
    "we expect therefore to increase the number of lensing events to detect the predicted asymmetry of macho lensing or to rule out a significant macho population in the halo of m31 .",
