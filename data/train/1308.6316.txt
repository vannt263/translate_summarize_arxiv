    "wireless communication systems have now become ubiquitous and constitute a key component of the fabric of modern day life",
    ". however , the inherent _ openness _ of the wireless medium makes it susceptible to adversarial attacks .",
    "the vulnerabilities of the wireless system can be largely classified based on the capability of an adversary    \\a ) _ eavesdropping attack _ , in which the eavesdropper ( passive adversary ) can listen to the wireless channel and try to infer information ( which if leaked may severely compromise data integrity ) .",
    "the study of information theoretic security ( or communication in presence of eavesdropping attacks ) was initiated by wyner @xcite , csiszr and krner @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been a resurgent interest in extending these results to multi - user scenarios .",
    "we refer the reader to a comprehensive tutorial @xcite on this topic and the references therein .",
    "\\b ) _ jamming attack _ , in which the jammer ( active adversary ) can transmit information in order to disrupt reliable data transmission or reception . while there has been some work in studying the impact of jamming on the capacity of point - to - point channels ( such as @xcite ) , the literature on information theoretic analysis of jamming attacks ( and associated countermeasures ) for multi - user channels is relatively sparse in comparison to the case of eavesdropping attacks .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on a class of _ time - varying _ jamming attacks over a fast fading multi - user multiple - input single - output ( miso ) broadcast channel ( bc ) , in which a transmitter equipped with @xmath3 transmit antennas intends to send independent messages to @xmath3 single antenna receivers . while several jamming scenarios are plausible",
    ", we initiate the study of jamming attacks by focusing on a simple yet harmful jammer .",
    "in particular , we consider a jammer equipped with @xmath3 transmit antennas and at any given time instant , has the capability of jamming a subset of the receivers .",
    "we consider a scenario in which the jammers strategy at any given time is random , i.e. , the subset of receivers to be jammed is probabilistically selected .",
    "furthermore , the jamming strategy varies in an independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "manner across time .",
    "such random , time - varying jamming attacks may be inflicted either intentionally by an adversary or unintentionally , in different scenarios .",
    "we next highlight some plausible scenarios in which such random time varying jamming attacks could arise .",
    "a resource constrained jammer that intentionally jams the receivers may conserve power by selectively jamming a subset ( or none ) of the receivers based on its available resources .",
    "such a jammer can also choose to jam the receivers when it has information about channel sounding procedures ( i.e. , when this procedure occurs ) and disrupts the communication only during those specific time instants .",
    "interference from neighboring cells in a cellular system can act as a bottleneck to improve spectral efficiency and be particularly harmful for cell edge users .",
    "the interference seen from adjacent cells in such scenarios can be time varying depending on whether the neighboring cells are transmitting on the same frequency or not ( which can change with time ) ; and the spatial separation of the users from interfering cells .",
    "a frequency - selective jammer can disrupt communication on certain frequencies ( carriers ) in multi - carrier ( for instance ofdm - based ) systems .",
    "a jammer that has knowledge about the pilot signal - based synchronization procedures , can jam only those sub carriers that carry the pilot symbols in order to disrupt the synchronization procedure of the multi - carrier system @xcite .",
    "our analysis in this paper suggests that the transmitter and receivers based on the knowledge of the jammers strategy , can reduce the effects of these jamming attacks by coding / transmitting across various jamming states ( jamming state here can be interpreted as the subset of frequencies / sub - carriers that are jammed at a given time instant ) .",
    "interestingly , the miso bc with a time - varying jamming attack can also be interpreted as a network with a time - varying topology .",
    "the concept of topological interference alignment has been recently introduced in @xcite ( also see @xcite , @xcite ) to understand the effects of time - varying topology on interference mitigation techniques such as interference alignment . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors characterize the @xmath0 by studying the interference management problem in such networks using a 1-bit delay - less feedback ( obtained from the receivers ) indicating the presence or absence of an interference link .",
    "the connection between jamming attacks considered in this paper and time - varying network topologies can be noted by observing the following : if at a given time , a receiver is jammed , then its received signal is completely drowned in the jamming signal ( assuming jamming power as high as the desired signal ) which is analogous to the channel ( or link ) to the jammed receiver being wiped out . for instance , in a @xmath4-user miso bc with a time - varying jamming attack , a total of @xmath5 _ topologies _ could arise ( see figure [ fig : figuremodel ] ) over time : none of the receivers are jammed ( one topology ) , all receivers are jammed ( one topology ) , only one out of the three receivers is jammed ( three topologies ) , or only two out of three receivers are jammed ( i.e. , three topologies ) .",
    "interestingly , the _ retroactive anti - jamming _",
    "techniques presented in this paper are philosophically related to topological interference alignment with alternating connectivity @xcite .",
    "the common theme that emerges is that it is necessary to _ code across _ multiple jamming states ( equivalently , topologies as in @xcite ) in order to achieve the optimal performance , which is measured in terms of degrees of freedom ( capacity at high snr ) .",
    "the model considered in the paper also bears similarities with broadcast erasure channels studied in @xcite , @xcite etc .",
    "the presence of a jamming signal ( @xmath6 ) at a receiver implies that the information bearing signal ( @xmath7 ) is un - recoverable from the received signal ( @xmath8 ) in the context of degrees of freedom ( since the pre - log of mutual information between @xmath7 and @xmath9 would be zero as both signal and jamming powers become large ) .",
    "hence , the presence of a jammer can be interpreted as an  erasure \" . in the absence of a jammer ( or no  erasure \" )",
    ", the signal @xmath7 can be recovered from @xmath10 within noise distortion .",
    "we study the impact of such random time - varying jamming attacks on the degrees - of - freedom ( henceforth referred by @xmath0 ) region of the miso bc .",
    "the @xmath0 of a network can be regarded as an approximation of its capacity at high snr and is also referred to as the pre - log of capacity . even in the absence of a jammer , it is well known that the @xmath0 is crucially dependent on the availability of channel state information at the transmitter ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the @xmath0 region of the miso bc has been studied under a variety of assumptions on the availability of @xmath1 including full ( perfect and instantaneous ) @xmath1 @xcite , no @xmath1 @xcite , delayed @xmath1 @xcite , compound @xmath1 @xcite , quantized @xmath1 @xcite , mixed ( perfect delayed and partial instantaneous ) @xmath1 @xcite and asymmetric @xmath1 ( perfect @xmath1 for one user , delayed @xmath1 for the other ) @xcite . to note the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath1",
    ", we remark that a sum @xmath0 of @xmath11 is achieved in the @xmath11-user miso bc when perfect @xmath1 information is available @xcite , while it reduces to @xmath12 ( with statistically equivalent receivers ) when no @xmath1 is available @xcite .",
    "interestingly it is shown in @xcite that completely outdated @xmath1 in a fast fading channel is still useful and helps increase the @xmath0 from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "interesting extensions to the @xmath3-user case with delayed @xmath1 are also presented in @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we denote the availability of @xmath1 ( by @xmath14 , we refer to the channel between the transmitter and the receiver , we _ do not _ assume the knowledge of the jammer s channel at the transmitter or the receivers ) through a variable @xmath15 , which can take values either @xmath16 , @xmath17 or @xmath18 ; where the state @xmath19 indicates that the transmitter has perfect and instantaneous channel state information at time @xmath20 , the state @xmath21 indicates that the transmitter has perfect but delayed channel state information ( i.e. , it has knowledge of the channel realizations of time instants @xmath22 at time @xmath20 ) , and the state @xmath23 indicates that the transmitter has no channel state information .",
    "-user miso broadcast channel.,width=453 ]    as mentioned above , the impact of @xmath1 on the @xmath0 of miso broadcast channels has been explored for scenarios in which there is no adversarial time - varying interference .",
    "the novelty of this work is two fold : a ) incorporating adversarial time - varying interference , and b ) studying the _ joint _ impact of @xmath1 and the knowledge about the absence / presence of interference at the transmitter ( termed @xmath2 ) .",
    "as we show in this paper , in the presence of a time - varying jammer , not only the @xmath1 availability but also the knowledge of jammer s strategy significantly impacts the @xmath0 . indeed ,",
    "if the transmitter is non - causally aware of the jamming strategy at time @xmath20 , i.e. , if it knows _ which _ receiver ( or receivers ) is going to be disrupted at time @xmath20 , the transmitter can utilize this knowledge and adapt its transmission strategy by : either transmitting to a subset of receivers simultaneously ( if only a subset of them are jammed / not - jammed ) or conserving energy by not transmitting ( if all the receivers are jammed ) . however , such adaptation may not be feasible if there is delay in learning the jammer s strategy .",
    "feedback delays could arise in practice as the detection of a jamming signal would be done at the receiver ( for instance , via a binary hypothesis test @xcite in which the receiver could use energy detection to validate the presence / absence of a jammer in its vicinity ) .",
    "this binary decision could be subsequently fed back to the transmitter . in presence of feedback delays",
    ", the standard approach would be to exploit the time correlation in the jammer s strategy to predict the current jammer s strategy from the delayed measurements .",
    "the predicted jammer state could then be used in place of the true jammer state . however ,",
    "if the jammer s strategy is completely uncorrelated across time ( which is the case if the jammers strategy is i.i.d ) , delayed feedback reveals no information about the current state , and a predict - then - adapt scheme offers no advantage .",
    "a third and perhaps worst case scenario could also arise in which the transmitter only has statistical knowledge of jammer s strategy",
    ". this could be the case when the feedback links are unreliable or if the feedback links themselves are susceptible to jamming attacks , i.e. , the outputs of feedback links are untrustworthy . to take all such plausible scenarios into account",
    ", we formally model the jamming strategy via an independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) random variable @xmath24 ; which we call the jammer state information @xmath25 at time @xmath20 .",
    "note here that in the context of the paper , the jammers state only indicates knowledge about the jammers strategy ( i.e. , which receivers are jammed ) and _ not _ the channel between the jammer and receiver . at time @xmath20 , if the @xmath26th component of @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath28 , it indicates that receiver @xmath26 is being jammed , and @xmath29 indicates that receiver @xmath26 receives a jamming free signal .",
