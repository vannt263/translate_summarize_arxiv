    "the kepler mission was launched by nasa in 2009 with the driving aim of discovering earth - like planets orbiting other stars ( devore et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "a number of prominent us research institutes are involved in the data recovery and reduction , but the ames research center , in particular , has a central developmental role .",
    "the kepler satellite has continuously surveyed a selected area of about 10@xmath010 degrees in the cygnus - lyra region of the galactic field to determine the proportion of stars , particularly of main sequence type , showing planetary transits photometrically .",
    "it could be reasonably anticipated that this proportion should not be extremely small ( budding et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "in fact , from examination of the @xmath1150000 stars in the target list of the kepler mission it can be asserted that the fraction of stars showing likely planetary transits is a few per cent .",
    "no particular requirement for host star composition appears required for planetary formation ( buchave et al . , 2012 ) .",
    "kepler s first results were announced in january 2010 , with the early planets having relatively short periods . at the time of writing , more than 3000",
    "planetary transits have been recorded and analyzed . mostly these are attributed to planets larger than the earth , although about 10% of candidates hitherto are of a size comparable to that of the earth .",
    "the majority of known examples are smaller than jupiter , although around 10 percent are of about the same size or larger . about 5%",
    "have been located in the ` habitable zones ' of their parent stars .",
    "nasa announced the positive identification of earth - sized planets towards the end of 2011 , and an early survey of the mission s findings was that of borucki et al .",
    "( 2011b ) .",
    "it should also be noted that a fair proportion of initially announced planet finds , perhaps more than @xmath130%  have since been marked as false positives ( matijevic et al . , 2012 ; bryson et al . , 2013 ) .",
    "the kepler telescope has a 1.4 m diameter main mirror with fast optics enabling its relatively wide diameter field of view .",
    "there are 21 separate ccd pairs , arranged in a 5@xmath05 square array with the corner elements missing .",
    "photometric accuracy is related to the position of a stellar image on this array , but for a mean flux count of about 186000 per minute for a mag 12.0 star ( cf .",
    "table [ tab : no2 ] , below ) a measuring standard deviation equivalent to about 383 ppm was estimated by the kepler mission engineers ( gilliland et al . , 2011 ) .",
    "this is close to our finding from the best fitting models pursued in this paper , although certain examples appear to show a wider deviation , for reasons we consider later .",
    "software for the primary photometric analysis used to produce the kepler mission s findings so far has been developed from , or related to , modeling procedures for eclipsing binary stars .",
    "a primary aim of the present study is to check the parameters of the selected planetary candidates and host stars found in the nasa exoplanet archive ( nea )  ( which for the candidates we have selected are the values found by batalha et al .",
    "( 2013 ) using alternative , or independent , curve - fitting techniques .",
    "given the open access to the nea , it is useful to compare different methods and check on the closeness of separate modeling results in a way that will add to general confidence on the analysis programs .",
    "regarding exoplanet photometry and its analysis , burrows ( 2012 ) noted the importance of continued awareness of technical developments , while referring also to an established background , citing the well - known wilson - devinney ( 1971 ) program based on the roche approximation for binary component shapes . at the same time , southworth ( 2012 ) discussed the merits of the ebop program ( nelson & davis , 1972 ; etzel , 1980 ; milone , 1993 ) , when developed as a robust and versatile tool for planetary transits .",
    "classical formulae applying to the eclipses of spherical bodies , but directed specifically to the star and planet configuration , were presented in a somewhat generalized form by mandel and agol ( 2002 ) and applied to the hst light curve of hd209458 , while kang et al .",
    "( 2012 ) adopted a very simple ` box - car ' fitting function , but tailored for fast application to large numbers of light curves with the purpose of statistical analysis in mind .",
    "other useful points relevant to transiting planet photometry were noted by seager and malln - ornelas ( 2003 ) .",
    "specifically , in this article , we report on our modifications of the previously produced gui - based curvefit close binary system analysis program ( zeilik et al . , 1988 ) to the form winkepler and its application to 16 selected planetary candidate light curves from the nea . a @xmath2-minimizing algorithm ( budding & najim , 1980 ; budding & zeilik , 1987 ; budding 1993 ) is built into winkepler .",
    "the ` best - fit ' model corresponds to the least value of @xmath2 , defined as @xmath3 ( bevington , 1969 ) , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the observed and calculated light levels at a particular phase and @xmath6 is the error estimate for the measured values of @xmath4 .",
    "the nea provides such estimates in the archive , and we discuss later how this may be checked .",
    "the program contains some user - applied options controlling the approach to the minimum , but , broadly , this follows a marquardt - levenberg strategy , with occasional search resettings when an advantageous direction for simultaneous parameter improvements is located .",
    "the formal determinacy of the underlying model can be checked from examination of the error matrix in the vicinity of the optimum fitting .",
    "this error matrix ( formed by inversion of the @xmath2 hessian ) should be positive definite for a formally determinate fitting .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the @xmath2 hessian are also evaluated as checks on the degree of interdependence of the selected parameter set .",
    "adequacy of the model entails that the value of @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the number of degrees of freedom of the data - set , should be acceptably close to unity at the optimum .",
    "if this ratio lies outside , say , a 90% confidence limit , which can be judged from standard tables of the @xmath9 distribution , then we can reasonably deduce that there is something amiss .",
    "this may be due to some other effect in the data that the model does not take into account , an inappropriately assigned value of @xmath10 , or failure of the optimization algorithm to converge properly on the best set of parameters .",
    "speed of evaluation of an algebraic form of fitting function is an advantage when exploring a wide range of parameter space and evaluating the parameter error matrix .",
    "relevant experience was gained by the present authors with the mauna kea photometry of hd 209458 ( cf .",
    "budding , rhodes & sullivan , 2005 ) .",
    "one interesting question concerned whether there is sufficient information content in the data to permit independent empirical checks on computed models of limb - darkening with sufficient confidence .",
    "this can provide an additional objective for the present analysis .",
    "winkepler is freeware , and can be downloaded from the website : http://home.comcast.net/.17exmichael.rhodes/. a screenshot of winkepler s main page is shown in fig [ pic : winkepler ] .",
    "winkepler continues the prescription for tidal and rotational distortions of the components as given by curvefit .",
    "this formulation adopts the classical approach to finding the shape of a body distorted by forces associated with rotation and tides by referring to equipotential surfaces .",
    "these surfaces can be described in terms of spherical harmonic series .",
    "clauraut s theorem for bodies in equilibrium ( cf .",
    "e.g.  pressley , 2001 ) can then be used to evaluate the coefficients of the terms in the series , with dependence on the structure of the distorted body .",
    "such coefficients ( @xmath11 ) have been evaluated for recent models of stars by inlek and budding ( 2012 ) . for the ` first order ' solution of clairaut s equation , in which the interaction of tides on tides is neglected ,",
    "the structural dependence is summarized by the three tidal terms @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and the rotational term @xmath15 .",
    "the values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 coefficients in this account of the stellar distortion are derived from numerical integration of a first - order differential equation that kopal ( 1959 ) called radau s equation .",
    "we may therefore refer to the underlying model as the ` radau ' model , to distinguish it from others ( in the ` roche ' model , for example , the foregoing @xmath18s would all revert to unity ) .",
    "the dependent variable in radau s equation is @xmath19 : a logarithmic derivative appearing in clairaut s equation that , in turn , reflects the internal stellar density distribution and is directly related to other parameters ( e.g.  @xmath18 , as above , or @xmath20 ) also used in this context .",
    "the star s angular rotation @xmath21 is factored in the above terms by @xmath22 ; @xmath23 corresponding to the default condition ( @xmath24 ) of synchronized rotation .",
    "further details on winkepler  its formalism , method and utilization  are given by rhodes ( 2013 ) .",
    "other aspects of the fitting procedure emerge in the applications to individual cases reported on later .",
    "the light curve data - sets , consisting mainly of short cadence , normalized pdscap_flux values at given times , were downloaded from the nea .",
    "details on the light curve selections are found in the later discussion sections for each candidate .",
    "input parameters used to set up the analyses were also downloaded from the nea , and are shown in tables [ tab : no1 ] and [ tab : no2 ] ) .",
    "light curves were selected without any particular preconceptions other than studying a reasonably typical group . in choosing later examples on the list , however , we tended to look for smaller sized planets , in order to find out how well determined their parameters could be .",
    "we used only a part of each data - set , that was centered on the minimum and twice the width of the transit duration .",
    "normally , we did no preliminary binning or detrending . for koi 42.01 , however , where initial values of @xmath7 were relatively high and a clear downward trend could be seen in the residuals across the eclipse , we carried out a linear detrending .",
    "the issue is discussed in section 3.12 .",
    "individual transits turn out to have high diagnostic power for the main geometric elements when the data has a reasonably good s / n ratio ( the eclipse depth @xmath110 @xmath0 the scatter level , say , and the data - set including at least @xmath1200 points ) . but a number of the light curves show additional effects apart from just the planetary transits .",
    "those effects are not pursued in any detail in this paper .",
    "still , it is necessary to be aware that pulsational microvariability or maculation may be present in the raw data and affect the quality of the transit fittings .",
    "we discuss specific examples in what follows .",

    "should be noticed that the former were occasionally changed during the period we have been working with the data , and such source information may change again .",
    "this may give a temporary quality to any particular set of detailed numerical results , though this is understandable given the very large ongoing programme of the kepler mission .",
    "at the present time , we are using the nea data for the input information relevant to our selected candidates , corresponding to the values listed by batalha et al ( 2013 ) .",
    "even so , comparison of individual curve - fitting results , at any time , reflects the purpose of independent , alternative analysis mentioned before .",
    "the relative scale of the error estimates is also relevant here .",

    "we derived this quantity and the other parameter at the right of table [ tab : no1 ] , i.e.  the coefficient of limb - darkening in the linear approximation @xmath34 , separately , but using the nea information .",

    ", ( 2009 ) , but the effects of the wide bandwidth are not small . in this case , a representative conversion formula , using a linearized approximation involving standard magnitudes and colours , becomes inaccurate for colour indices appreciably different from zero . on the other hand , the effective wavelength for the relatively small range of near solar temperatures involved does not vary by much from its average value of about 0.61 @xmath46 m . from the given temperatures and corresponding bolometric corrections",
    ", we can then use the barnes - evans colour correlation in reverse , to derive @xmath45 colours for the candidate stars . using the photometric gradient concept ( budding & demircan , 2007 , eqn 3.13 ) and a derived effective wavelength of the kepler mission filter for a given effective temperature ( budding & demircan , 2007 , eqn 3.30 )",

    "has an information advantage over deriving these parameters with others from a single fitting function .",
    "given the period , if we had also the stellar mass , kepler s third law would yield a fairly reliable separation of planet from star ( since we can reasonably neglect the mass of the planet ) .",
    "but prior estimates of the stellar masses came from indirect evidence that depends on additional assumptions .",
    "these masses can probably only be estimated to within @xmath110 percent of their true values .",
    "this point has an important bearing on subsequent quantification , since the absolute sizes of objects determined from light curve fittings can not be more precisely known than the separation of the components .",
    "although the separation has only a weak dependence ( power 1/3 ) on mass , this uncertainty means that , at best , we could expect only three meaningful digits in the semi - major axes , and usually fewer than three .",
    "the values of @xmath32 listed in table [ tab : no1 ] and calculated in this way can differ from other possible derivations that we discuss shortly . we have retained the third significant digit in table [ tab : no1 ] to allow assessment of such differences .",
    "differences in the absolute separations of star and planet occur when we use the listed surface gravity and radius values to calculate masses from the formula @xmath49 ( masses and radii in solar units ) .",
    "this formula can produce quite unlikely masses for main sequence stars , that are reflected in significantly different @xmath32 values , despite the low sensitivity to mass .",
    "this problem was recognized by batalha et al ( 2013 ) , where the observed gravities were ` corrected ' to those appropriate for main sequence stars of the same effective temperature , composition and mean age of the solar neighbourhood .",
    "the masses derived from such corrected gravities are the masses given in table 1 .",
    "inclusion of the gravity constraint , even corrected , will reflect some natural evolutionary spread about the main sequence in the listed masses . here , however , another issue arises , in that the constraint brings in also the stellar radius .",
    "this can , in principle , be derived from applying another condition , this time using the photometrically fitted relative radius ( @xmath50 in conventional terminology ) , which allows an estimate of the mean density ( @xmath51 ) , since @xmath52 .",
    "the absolute radius then follows from @xmath53 .",
    "note here , though , the sensitivity of @xmath51 to the derived @xmath50 value , as well as the imprecisely known gravity .",
    "besides , we can reasonably expect that @xmath51 would vary by @xmath11 order of magnitude for solar type stars on the main sequence .",
    "the uncertainty thus introduced into the absolute radius must affect masses derived from the gravity constraint pejoratively , and an indication of this was reported by muirhead et al ( 2012 ) .",
    "two different paths were followed to set up our light - curve models : ( 1 ) we estimated preliminary parameters from measurements of light curve segments shown in the nea display facility , aided by the basic formulae given in chapter 7 of budding & demircan ( 2007 ) ; ( 2 ) we adopted trial parameters from those given in the nea .",
    "relevant quantities are listed in table [ tab : no3 ] .",
    "we have generally optimized the curve - fitting using the five parameters @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath50 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 listed in table [ tab : no3 ] .",
    "the first two of these locate the reference points for the phase and flux axes , respectively .",
    "these are of interest for time of mid - transit variation ( ttv ) studies , or absolute flux calibrations .",
    "the other 3 parameters correspond to the usual main geometric ` elements ' .",
    "after each parameter value we give the leading digit of our error estimate as it would affect the last tabulated digit of the parameter value .",

    "it appears to be a relatively uncomplicated light curve , in which a ` hot jupiter ' transits the parent star towards its limb .",
    "the light curve data for koi 1.01 consisted of the section from bjd 122.68 to 122.84 of the short cadence data set from quarter 0 .",

    "the nea gives the relative radius of the star @xmath50 as 0.118 , compared to our 0.1223@xmath720.0007 .",
    "the physical sizes are : @xmath84 = 0.95 @xmath85 , and @xmath80 = 13.11 @xmath86 .",
    "this is in fair agreement with the nea listing of 1.06 @xmath85 and 14.40 r@xmath87 respectively .",
    "koi 2.01 (= hat - p-7 , kepler-2 ) has become a well - known exoplanet system since its discovery by pal et al .",
    "the relatively large star in this system with its close - in planet makes for a fairly wide transit of duration around 10% of the complete phase cycle .",
    "our light curve for koi 2.01 comes from section jd 121.25 - 121.46 of the short cadence data of quarter 0 .",
    "the nea value for @xmath50 is 0.214 is in essential agreement with our value of 0.2155@xmath720.0003 .",
    "but we find a significantly lower value of the inclination , 87.2@xmath720.5 deg versus the nea value of 88.24 deg .",
    "our ratio of radii , 0.0761 , is not far from that of the nea value , 0.075 , so our solution would yield a fairly large planet , 14.40 @xmath86 which is significantly smaller than the nea value of 22.30 @xmath86 .",
    "the transit minimum shows clear signs of a spot eclipse .",
    "this lasts for about 8 deg of phase during the ingress , or about 0.14 of the stellar diameter , i.e.  this spot seems likely to have a significantly larger size than the planet ( @xmath14.5 @xmath88 ) .",
    "it must therefore be much larger than known solar spots .",
    "the modelling of spot eclipses considered by budding ( 1988 ) could not be used directly here , since that applied only to the occultations of spots by relatively large bodies .",
    "koi 2.01 s relatively massive planet is close in to the star in a configuration comparable to that of koi 13.01 , for which proximity effects are measurable from the light curve ( see below ) .",
    "we therefore sought to fit the full light curve for this system using the radau model and the ` black body ' approximation for the light redistribution ( budding & demircan , 2007 ; p319 ) to scale trial proximity effects .",
    "these effects appear masked by the maculation effect and perhaps other contributions to the light curve segments we studied , rendering our proximity term evaluation unreliable .",
    "however , welsh et al ( 2010 ) , after detailed processing of 15 short cadence light curves , derived a mass ratio of about 0.013 using the roche model in this way .",
    "koi 3.01 is another object whose planetary status was studied by the earlier hatnet project ( bakos et al , 2002 , 2009 , 2010 ) .",
    "the star is also known as hat - p-11 and , as a confirmed planet , kepler-3 .",
    "the light curve of koi 3.01 , shown in fig 3 , and taken from bjd 144.27 - 144.45 of the short cadence data of quarter 1 , corresponds to the wider separation and smaller star and planet than for the first two examples .",
    "the star is somewhat brighter than in koi 2.01 , but it is a lower mass object .",
    "again there are signs of surface inhomogeneities , this time relatively small in size .",
    "our finding that the planet is about 4.23 times bigger than the earth in radius agrees closely with the nea value of 4.68 r@xmath87 , and in apparent exact agreement with that of bakos et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .",
    "bakos et al ( 2009 , 2010 ) found an eccentricity of 0.198 to the planetary orbit , having a periastron longitude of @xmath1355 with a formal error of about 15 .",
    "in other words , the major axis of the elliptical orbit is not far from the plane of the sky , the planet exiting from the transit more quickly than its entrance .",
    "we have checked this in our fitting program .",
    "the transit s fitting is improved by taking its possible asymmetry into account , and the determined value of the optimal periastron longitude corresponding to the assigned eccentricity @xmath89 is about 8 .",
    "the determination is relatively good , if we suppose all the other parameters are already well - defined , because the degree of asymmetry of the transit is close to the maximum possible for the assigned value of @xmath89 .",
    "however , this result should probably not be taken at face value .",
    "the improvement in the transit fitting can be associated with a better match of the model of light variation through the region of the eclipsed spot . disentangling the photometric effects of maculation from those of orbital eccentricity",
    "is not straightforward for the empirical analysis of a single transit , as we are doing .",
    "bakos et al .",
    "( 2009 ) also noted the complications to parameter estimation arising from the interactions of such varied causes of data variation . for the present , therefore , this apparent confirmation of the orbital eccentricity should be regarded cautiously .",
    "we took the light curve for koi 4.01 from section bjd 172.80 - 173.04 of the short cadence data in quarter 2 .",
    "with an transit depth about 1/4 that of the first few examples , koi 4.01 , a fainter source than the others so far , exhibits a much less well - defined light curve .",
    "the derived planet size turns out to be quite comparable to that in koi 3.01 , while the star itself is appreciably bigger , so the transit effect is smaller .",
    "there is nothing obvious in these data that would immediately indicate a false - positive , but koi 4 was given this status , apparently due to inclusion of a background eclipsing binary in the photometry .",
    "this points up the possibility that other _ prima facie _ planetary light curves turn out to be false positives .    here",
    "we note that a false positive occurs when the star identified with a planetary transit is not so eclipsed .",
    "there may still be a planetary transit within the photometric aperture , but small shifts in the light centre during the eclipse indicate the effects relate to another star , not the one identified in the catalogue ( see bryson et al , 2013 , for a recent review ) .",
    "in fact , a plausible alternative solution was found , corresponding to a background algol system about 6.4 mag fainter than the target star .",
    "the small relative radius of the eclipsed star , required by the low phase range of the eclipse , combined with the 3.85 d period , would require the background system to be relatively massive ",
    "perhaps @xmath15 solar masses or so , but the resulting @xmath7 value ( 1.07 ) is hardly different from the planetary transit model in terms of probability .    there is a distinct maculation effect seen in the out - of - transit light of this star .",
    "periodogram analysis ( available as an on - screen option on the nea data display webpage ) indicated a likely value of @xmath15.8 days for the stellar rotation period as a result .      in the case of koi 5.01 , there was a reasonable agreement between our starting trial value of @xmath50 , using the @xmath90 and @xmath32 values of table [ tab : no1 ] , and the value obtained from the curve - fitting .",
    "it is thus not surprising that our final value of @xmath74 , at 6.45 r@xmath87 , is not far from the nea value ( 5.66 r@xmath87 ) .",
    "the transit is complete , although close to the limb .",
    "the data used for this candidate are from section bjd 171.13 - 171.30 of the short cadence measures from quarter 2 .",
    "koi 7.01 , also known as kepler-4 , was reviewed by borucki et al .",
    "( 2011a ) .",
    "with koi 7.01 we again find a relatively small planet in a not - too - distant orbit .",
    "although the loss of light is similar to koi 4.01 , the flux is only 1/3 of that , so the low s / n of the light curve makes for a generally imprecise fitting .",
    "nevertheless , our value for the planetary radius , 6.18 @xmath86 , is significantly larger than the nea value of 3.72 @xmath86 , and is also larger than than the 3.99 @xmath86 found by borucki et al .",
    "( 2011a ) .",
    "as indicated in the notes on table 5 in the previous section , the scatter of the data in the uniform distribution of residuals is appreciably larger than the nea numbers suggest and micro - variability of some kind may be the explanation .",
    "we followed the option of carrying out a periodogram analysis for this data - set , which comes from section bjd 171.65 - 171.99 of the short cadence run in quarter 2 .",
    "we found the power spectrum having spectral components of much lower frequency than those corresponding to small pulsations . the present paper ,",
    "whilst leading to suggestions about candidate micro - variables , does not address the detailed properties of such stars .      the flux for koi 10.01 is an order of magnitude less than for koi 1.01 , though the depth of transit is comparable in this data section from bjd 173.82 - 174.09 of the short cadence , quarter 2 run .",
    "we therefore do not expect so good a solution for this large planet , bigger than jupiter by @xmath140% . the scatter in the solution",
    "is @xmath15 times bigger than that of koi 1.01 . as with koi 7.01",
    ", the star may therefore be showing some additional effect that the modelling does not take into account , perhaps small - scale , short - period inherent fluctuations .",
    "the relatively large value of @xmath7 in table [ tab : no5 ] supports the same inference .",
    "the planet in this system has the greatest separation from its host star in our sample , at just over 30 solar radii , but its estimated mean surface temperature at over 800 k is still too high for the ` habitable zone ' . the star is not bright , so the combination of short transit phase range and scatter makes for a relatively poor solution .",
    "the preset value of the limb - darkening coefficient given in table [ tab : no1 ] ( 0.50 ) , produced a systematic trend in the residuals .",
    "our optimized value ( 0.35 ) has effectively removed this irregularity . since optimized limb - darkening coefficients , when allowed to be free parameters , generally agree with those coming from the van hamme ( 1993 ) code , this disagreement is suggestive that one of the underlying parameters for the code , probably the star s effective temperature , has been wrongly assigned in the nea .",
    "the used light curve data are from bjd 128.43 - 129.05 of the short cadence set from quarter 0 .",
    "koi 13.01 has become a well - known candidate of special interest , since it was noticeable , even from the preliminary inspections , that the light curve shows a secondary minimum and proximity effects .",
    "this accords with reasonable expectation for a relatively large planet at fairly low separation .",
    "photometry of this object is , however , compromised by the presence of a close companion of comparable brightness , which entails slight shifts of the light centre on the detection array that may affect the processing statistics .",
    "some data - sets also show indications of additional light variations , perhaps related to maculation effects , or the role of the additional low mass companion in the host star multiple system recently identifed by santerne et al .",
    "welsh et al .",
    "( 2010 ) mentioned also the possibility of a focus drift .",
    "although the transit fitting , that corresponds to data selected from bjd 169.81 - 170.07 of the short cadence second quarter run , may look good , judging from a fairly uniform scatter of residuals , such difference curves have sometimes shown residual short - term irregularities ( blips ) at the inner contact points . in this connection , we anticipated a possible failure of the limb - darkening approximation very close to the limb . a second order limb - darkening term was therefore included in the fitting function",
    "however , it became clear that this enhancement , whilst slightly lowering the optimal @xmath2 value , did nothing to remove the blips .",
    "later experiments have shown that such effects are associated with a poor selection of the orbital inclination .",
    "this controls the rate at which the planet passes over the limb , and that plays a critical role for the blips .",
    "the presence of blips in an otherwise satisfactory set of residuals lends a good diagnostic quality about the action of the optimization , and for the inclination in particular .",
    "removal of the end - point blips in fitting the transit gave a definitive quality to the corresponding main geometrical elements .",
    "figure [ fig : koi13 ] shows the fitting to the primary transit used to derive the parameters given in tables [ tab : no3 ] and [ tab : no4 ]",
    ".    there also appears a slight residual trend both through the transit region and a little way on either side .",
    "this may be associated with the flux centroid drifting , mentioned above ( see also mislis & hodgkin , 2012 ) . on the whole , we regard our modelling of this complex system hitherto as preliminary .",
    "the object will merit much closer individual attention .",
    "as mentioned , koi 13.01 is associated with normal proximity effects throughout its orbital cycle . to examine these effects we used normalized long cadence data from quarter 2 extending from bjd 208.507 to 210.612 .",
    "figure [ fig : koi13ecl ] shows the out - of - transit region of the light curve of koi 13 on an expanded scale .",
    "the primary minimum region has been clipped .",
    "the secondary eclipse of the reflected light is visible , as are the proximity effects .",
    "the first maximum is seen to be slightly higher than the second one , in agreement with the effect of ` doppler beaming ' .",
    "doppler beaming is programmed to correct the assigned relative luminosity of the host star @xmath91 ( essentially unity , unless another star is contributing to the measured flux ) , so that instead of @xmath91 in the fitting function ( budding & demircan , 2007 ; eqn 9.17 ) we use @xmath92 , say , through the formula @xmath93 here the line of sight component of the ( stellar ) orbital velocity is given by @xmath94 , @xmath95 being the mass ratio planet to star , @xmath96 the orbital phase and @xmath57 the inclination .",
    "the velocity of light @xmath97 is set at 299792 s@xmath98 .",
    "the orbital velocity is determined from known parameters as @xmath99 . using the value of the planetary mass from table [ tab : no1 ]",
    "the effect turns out to improve the fitting , but only at a marginal level of significance : @xmath2 decreasing by an amount of order unity after the replacement of @xmath91 by @xmath92 in the fitting function .    as noted by mislis & hodgkin ( 2012 ) ,",
    "the proximity effects offer a way to determine the mass ratio , although various other parameters are involved in fixing the scale of these effects .",
    "one parameter is @xmath50 , which scales the ` ellipticity effect ' with a third power dependence  so clearly having relatively high sensitivity .",
    "we found the out - of - eclipse variation tending to bias @xmath50 to a slightly larger number than that corresponding to the optimal fitting of the transit alone .",
    "however , since the transit phases are relatively clear of proximity effects , we felt it legitimate to use the @xmath50 determined from the transit to throw the weight of the complete light curve fitting onto the mass ratio .",
    "actually , the mass ratio ( @xmath95 ) and gravity - brightening coefficient ( @xmath100  another unknown parameter producing the out - of - eclipse ` ellipticity effect ' light variation ) are both involved in the same linear combination , so if either is decreased the other must be correspondingly increased to produce essentially the same result .",
    "the structural parameters also influence the scale of the ellipticity effect in the same kind of linearly correlated way as @xmath100 , so their inclusion tends simply to scale down the value of @xmath95 in proportion to the increase in the @xmath101 coefficients ( see introduction section ) above unity .",
    "we adopted the value of @xmath100 according to its ` black - body ' formula given in winkepler , allowing the ellipicity effect to determine only @xmath95 .",
    "the value of @xmath95 found in this way ( 0.0033@xmath720.0005 ) compares well with that ( 0.0029@xmath72 0.0005 ) given by mislis & hodgkin ( 2012 ) .",
    "we should not regard this close numerical agreement as definitive , however . as we have seen the light curves of koi 13.01",
    "are complicated by other effects not included in our present model , while even within that model there is scope for the variation of a combination of other parameters that can mimic the effect of a given mass ratio .",
    "hence , the formal error on @xmath95 is really only a lower limit , corresponding to what could be estimated as the error if all the other parameters were regarded as precisely known .",
    "still , the general consistency about the result is encouraging ( see also welsh et al .",
    ", 2010 ; mazeh et al . ,",
    "2012 ) .",
    "the jupiter - sized planet , koi 17.01 , produces a clear and relatively deep primary minimum , even if over a small phase range .",
    "the photometry , corresponding to bjd 173.09 - 173.39 of the short cadence second quarter run , shows a rather higher level of scatter in the fitting than might have been anticipated ( cf .",
    "figs  21 and 22 ) .",
    "there may then be some residual variation in the light curve , though not as pronounced as for some other examples .",
    "although a somewhat fainter and noisier data - set than that of koi 17.01 , the light curve shows a relatively deep eclipse ( in fact the deepest in our selection ) caused by the near - central transit of large ( @xmath11.6 r@xmath102 ) planet in a comparable configuration .",
    "our light curve for koi 20.01 came from from bjd 170.81 - 171.20 of the short cadence data set from quarter 2 .",
    "this planet with radius at about 2.7 r@xmath87 , is one of the smaller ones in our list .",
    "taking into account also the wide separation of close to 30 solar radii , the determinacy of the transit is not high .",
    "the flux level is relatively high , however , so a solution is possible in which the planet passes not far from the limb of the host star .",
    "the fitting is shown in figure [ fig : koi42 ] .",
    "the data were taken from bjd 145.36 - 145.75 of the short cadence first quarter run .",
    "the residuals curve in fig  24 shows a small downward trend , and an additional variability for this star was mentioned in section 2.2 in connection with the anomalously high value of @xmath7 . following the approach of zeilik et al ( 1988 ) in dealing with light curves affected by starspots , a ` cleaning ' stage after the first fitting was considered .",
    "the residuals curve may be fitted by a linear regression , the original transit data then ` corrected ' to a ` clean ' input file , and the fitting run again .",
    "the main geometric parameters all have an even - function effect in varying the light curve about zero phase though , so , while the residuals would be reduced by such a correction and the @xmath7 anomaly reduced , the optimal parameter - set of the model should not be greatly affected .",
    "the downward trend across the range is not more than @xmath120% of the mean scatter , so we would expect the maximum effect on the @xmath170% excess of @xmath7 in the original fitting to be not more than @xmath140% . the initial impression from fig  24",
    "is that random scatter is greater than the assigned 0.0001 , and a small pulsational behaviour can be anticipated .",
    "in fact , the fitting to the detrended data - set did reduce @xmath7 by most of its original excess , while there were also small changes to the main parameters , particularly @xmath50 .",
    "it is known that the optimization convergence is slowed by the presence of extraneous effects , so it can be presumed that the detrending accelerated the fitting process to an inherently better set of parameter estimates .",
    "the @xmath117% remaining excess of @xmath7 may still reflect some inherent short - period variability .",
    "this system has the shortest period of our sample , and the planet s radius is found to be only about 1.64 r@xmath87 , making the planet a ` hot earth ' , orbiting close in to a sunlike star .",
    "the transit is relatively wide in phase , therefore , but not in time .",
    "figure [ fig : koi72 ] shows the fast ingress and egress , with data points evenly spaced .",
    "the data are from bjd 263.82 - 263.97 of the short cadence observations in the second quarter .    the transit , which appears shallow against the scatter , is not well resolved in this way .",
    "even with this non - optimal monitoring arrangement , however , figures  25 & 26 show that an acceptable solution is possible .",
    "a shallow and narrow eclipse makes for a relatively poorly defined parameter - set for this rather faint system that resembles koi 42.01 .",
    "our light curve is from bjd 271.24 - 271.80 of the short cadence data set from quarter 2 .",
    "the transit appears free of additional complications and the @xmath7 ratio and distribution of residuals imply the main photometric elements , which are not so different from those of the nea data - base , are reliable .",
    "yet the originally assigned nea radius of the host star ( from the gravity formula ) is appreciably different from the value found by our program .",
    "this latter radius is relatively large : at around 3 solar radii it is the largest star in the sample , and presumably corresponds to a relatively old object now well on towards the end of its main sequence state .",
    "koi 377.01 is also known as kepler 9-b and formed part of a detailed review by torres et al .",
    "koi 377 contains at least one similar , but more distant , planet as well as probably a third inner and smaller one .",
    "torres et al .  ( 2011 ) , concerned with the occurrence of false positives , or non - planetary configurations that might simulate similar transit - like effects , were able to show with confidence that koi 377.01 is a saturn - sized planet .",
    "time of transit variations in this system were previously studied by holman et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .    the data used for koi 377.01 came from bjd 644.89 - 645.24 of the short cadence run from quarter 7 , from which we can clearly see that this solar - type star is affected by significant ( @xmath10.5% of the mean flux ) out - of - transit variability , probably maculation .",
    "there are also a couple of rather high ` rogue points ' .",
    "such occasional discordant individual points have been noticed in the data - sets examined for this study .",
    "they may perhaps result from cosmic ray effects not removed in preliminary processing of the archived data . or , in keeping with the idea of enhanced magnetic activity associated with strong maculation , one could perhaps also expect occasional flares .",
    "rogue points tend to slow convergence in the modelling and it is advisable to remove them when possible .    the regular approach to maculation effects has been to detrend beforehand ( cf .",
    "koi 42.01 above ) , although the phase range of the transit is often so small as make the maculation variation of very little effect during a single transit , as here , particularly as the light loss is relatively deep for this central transit",
    ". figure [ fig : koi377 ] shows an 8 deg phase range about the transit displaying a good fit for the model .",
    "periodogram fitting to the out - of - transit variation indicated a @xmath18.4 d period , which can be associated with the stellar rotation .",
    "the planet , with less than 700 k mean temperature , is the coolest in our sample , but still quite far from being a ` habitable zone ' candidate .",
    "a significant eccentricity was given for this system in the ( unsourced ) nasa ames research center website ( http://kepler.nasa.gov/mission/discoveries/ ) .",
    "as with koi 3.01 , we tested the listed value , @xmath89 = 0.15 , with a transit fitting , having first produced a trial value for the longitude parameter @xmath21 . in practice , it is the mean anomaly at phase zero @xmath103 which requires specification for an eccentric light curve fitting , but @xmath21 is then determined by the formula @xmath104 90@xmath105 ( budding & demircan , 2007 , p314 ) . however , our transit fitting experiments were not decisive on this .",
    "a wide range of values of @xmath103 seemed to give almost the same final @xmath2 value , while if we allow also the zero phase parameter @xmath54 also to be simultaneously adjustable the solution loses determinacy . basically , the scatter is too large in this data - set for a definitive assessment of the system s possible eccentricity from transit fitting alone , and even if numbers are produced for the eccentricity parameters they must be compromised by the aforementioned additional light variation effects .",
    "the planet s longitude of periastron @xmath21 = 269.4 @xmath106 corresponding to the marginally lowest value of @xmath2 , has the major axis of the ellipse close to the line of sight , i.e.  an almost symmetrical transit .",
    "this point by itself argues for poor determinacy of the eccentricity parameters from transit fitting alone , in this case .",
    "figure [ fig : koi388 ] shows the transit of a relatively small planet ( ` super - earth ' ) about one of the lower mass stars in our sample , that has a relatively low flux level .",
    "the transit is thus very noisy , like koi 72.01 but worse , yet a 4-parameter determinate solution ( the relatively independent phase correction @xmath54 having been eliminated in a preliminary run ) was found .",
    "high determinacy for such a data - set can not be expected , but it is worth considering in the context of small planet discoveries that the kepler mission addresses .",
    "the light curve data for koi 388.01 was drawn from bjd 741.22 - 741.68 of the short cadence data in quarter 8 .",
    "we have presented an independent approach to the analysis of archival photometric data from the kepler mission , applying alternative curve - fitting techniques with a modified version of the curvefit program for close binary systems ( zeilik et al . , 1988 ) :",
    "the fitting function involves tidal and rotational distortions of the components that depend on structural coefficients derived for modern stellar models .",
    "this permits , in principle , checks on stellar structure or the role of rotation that is non - synchronized to the planet s orbital motion . the important issue of determinacy for the underlying model is also checked in winkepler by examination of the curvature hessian at the optimum .",
    "several results of interest have emerged .",
    "for example , the data on koi  7.01 , 10.01 and 42.01 point to additional microvariability , apart from the main transit phenomena analysed .",
    "similarly , the light curves of koi 2.01 and 3.01 show clear evidence of surface inhomogeneities .",
    "such effects , not included in the present model , are reflected in high optimal values of @xmath7 .",
    "the case of koi 42.01 raised the issue of detrending .",
    "since we dealt mainly with transits that often correspond to very narrow intervals of phase , the fitting function s inherent symmetry across the eclipse would often not be compromised by a slight linear gradient in the observations . for koi 42.01",
    "the value of @xmath7 was significantly affected , however , and linear detrending before the final fitting was advantageous for a more rapid convergence towards a realistic @xmath7 value and parameter - set .",
    "the difference in the resulting geometric elements after the detrending was quite small in comparison to the derived errors , however .",
    "we have shown that in most cases there is sufficient information in the transit sections of the light curves alone to allow a 5 , often 6 , element specification of the model .",
    "more information would be contained in light curves having a complete phase range , but for many of these sunlike stars there are relatively strong maculation effects that are separate from the parameter - sets of direct relevance to the present study and complicate the out - of - eclipse variations on a relatively large scale . in a few cases , we could estimate a likely rotation period using the maculation effect .",
    "for koi  4.01 we found a solution that was close to that previously published in the nea , and essentially comparable to all the other normal star and planet combinations in this paper .",
    "however , matijevic et al .  (",
    "2012 ) cast doubt on this candidate as an exoplanet , indicating a more likely background close binary star .",
    "if such an ambiguity can exist among such normal - seeming candidates the implications for discoveries of exoplanets by the transit method could be seriously compromised , unless checks for background eclipses associated with active pixel offsets are simultaneously available ( bryson et al . , 2013 ) . in that case",
    ", it may be possible to confirm the real source of the variation ascribed to a planetary transit of a given star .",
    "bryson et al .  ( 2013 ) show that the planetary transit model for such a light curve may give an obviously poor fitting result , that would be signalled by the @xmath7 value at the optimum .",
    "it is also still possible for the eclipse to result from a planet , but not of the target star .",
    "the situation can be checked , in the curve - fitting context , by relaxing the condition that the fractional light of the eclipsed star is effectively unity , as in the normal case . for koi  4.01",
    ", we thus found that the light curve could be modelled by a background classical algol as effectively as by a planetary transit . in the absence of independent evidence coming from apparent shifts of the light centre on the detector array , ambiguity on the cause of the eclipses",
    "would remain .",
    "checks of theoretical linear limb - darkening coefficients by perturbing initially set values and allowing subsequent optimization have shown the values of van hamme ( 1993 ) to be generally supported to within reasonable accuracy limits , though this was not the case for koi 1.01 and 12.01 .",
    "the assigned temperatures may be inappropriate for some reason , or the effects of interstellar extinction considered , in such examples .",
    "the inclusion of a second order term in the limb - darkening approximation had only a marginal effect on @xmath7 : the expected amplitude of this term would normally only be of the order of accuracy to which the linear term can be specified .",
    "koi 13.01 is noticeably different in several respects . here",
    ", we were able to test the program , including its newly added doppler beaming component , to the complete light curve .",
    "the significance of this latter component was demonstrated by a small reduction of the fitting s @xmath2 .",
    "the effects of structural coefficients in the fitting function were also checked for this example . since the proximity effects scale mainly as a direct product of @xmath95 and @xmath107 a few percent decrease in @xmath95",
    "is observed in moving from the roche ( @xmath108 ) to radau ( @xmath109 ) models .",
    "we expect the significance of this point to become enhanced in future cases of well - defined light curves containing large ( jupiter sized or greater ) planets of short period , whose mass ratios may be independently checked spectroscopically .      in figure",
    "[ fig : ratioofr_1 ] we show the trend of our results for the relative radius @xmath110 against those published by the nea @xmath111 . the regression coefficient",
    "( at 0.9978 ) looks reassuring , although we may notice that the @xmath110 values of the present paper are generally slightly greater than those of the data - base @xmath111 by a few percent .",
    "the recent addition of error estimates to the nea parameter listings , together with those of the foregoing tables , allow a better perspective on the generally low significance of the differences in @xmath50 values .",
    "the situation is similar with the ratio of radii ( fig [ fig : ratioofradii ] ) , apart from koi 13 , where we find a distinctly smaller planet than that of the nea .",
    "although , for some reason , the nea error estimates for @xmath56 appear about an order of magnitude lower than our ( interdependent ) ones , the discrepancy for koi 13.01 is outside the range of assigned errors , unlike koi 4.01 and 10.01 .",
    "it is with the distribution of inclinations ( fig [ fig : ratioofinclination ] ) that we find a small but significantly different trend , in the sense that the nea inclinations are peaked more towards the 90  limit than ours . running a check for a random distribution of detectable ( totally ) eclipsing binaries , i.e.  satisfying @xmath112 for a given value of @xmath50 , demonstrates the expected flatness of the distribution for high values of @xmath57 .",
    "it is well known that , in general , the distribution of observed inclinations of binary orbits on the sky is proportional to @xmath113 .",
    "this means that the distribution of observed inclinations can be reproduced from a uniform distribution of numbers in the range 0 to 1 by considering @xmath114 for those numbers .",
    "alternatively , the tendency to constancy of the parent distribution @xmath113 , when @xmath57 is close to 90 degrees , implies that the numbers in each degree interval close to 90 , for a given representative value of @xmath50 , should be approximately similar . if a significant number of long period planets are included , the observed inclinations would compact towards 90 , due to the decreasing value of @xmath50 , but these cases are less frequently detected , and we have only 3 planets with a period longer than 10 d. planets of solar type stars that cluster around an average 3 d period should have their inclinations distributed reasonably uniformly over the range @xmath182 - 90 degrees .    we have found , in fitting procedures that start with a value of @xmath50 that is too small , that most of the transit can be well fitted with a high value of @xmath57 .",
    "residual small blips at the ingress and egress points in the difference curve may remain , however , even though their effect on the net value of @xmath2 is small .",
    "this possible ` @xmath2-valley ' in the optimization process may have occurred for nea solutions whose inclinations appear somewhat clustered towards 90 degrees .",
    "our independent testing of the parametrization of light curves from the nea shows a good measure of agreement in most cases .",
    "where differences were found , we have inquired into their causes .",
    "we believe some differences arise from the more physically detailed fitting function and thorough optimization sequences of our findings .",
    "it is possible that local minima for @xmath2 occur for certain parameter combinations .",
    "the issue shows up in the difference ( residuals ) curve as fairly uniform scatter over most of the range , but sometimes with a few short - term irregularities , typically in the ingress and egress regions .",
    "further optimization experiments with small random shifts in initial parameter sets near known approximate solutions can remove these .",
    "some of the differences in our absolute parameters may come from a different procedure for finding the host star radius .",
    "the nea appears to have retained @xmath115 values using the gravity estimates , as mentioned in section 2.1 .",
    "here we can keep in mind the relative accuracies and sensitivities .",
    "semi - major axes calculated using the very precisely known period may have a reasonable accuracy despite the imprecisely known host star mass , since the sensitivity of @xmath32 to @xmath116 is low . on the other hand ,",
    "the mean density estimate is sensitive to @xmath50 and the gravity can not be determined photometrically with sufficient precision at present .",
    "our values of @xmath7 adopted as optimal are mostly consistent with a high probability to the underlying ( eclipsing binary system ) model .",
    "this is on the basis of error estimates for the data - sets supplied directly by the nea and checked by reasonable statistical arguments on the flux detection .",
    "a few fittings result in @xmath7 values that are unusually high , pointing to the occurrence of inherent microvariability , surface maculation or both .",
    "the possibility of empirical checks of limb - darkening , gravity - brightening , structural and rotational effects ( in selected examples ) , gave additional objectives to the present work .",
    "only koi 13.01 , in our sample , shows a sufficient scale of proximity effects ( above other causes of flux variation ) to allow testing of the relevant parameters ( gravity darkening , reflection and doppler beaming ) .",
    "the mass ratio could be optimized and the empirical result is within reasonable error limits of other determinations of this value , although there are still reasons to be cautious about the value of @xmath95 for the complex system koi 13.01 at present .",
    "a main argument in this article has been that it is useful to compare different analytical approaches .",
    "we have presented the new , purpose - designed , software winkepler to this aim .",
    "this will help to make finally accepted stellar and planetary parameters and their corresponding error estimates , as obtained from transit photometry , more robust and better understood .",
    "our initial sample of 16 planetary candidate light curves is perhaps rather small , but a methodologically useful avenue into the special issues raised by planet eclipses .",
