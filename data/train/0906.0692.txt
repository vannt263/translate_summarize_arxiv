    "the discovery of superconductivity in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 by maeno and coworkers @xcite has attracted widespread attention partially because of the structural similarity with the cuprate - based high - temperature superconductors ( htsc s ) . while the mother compounds of the htsc s are charge transfer insulators , and they usually need to be doped to become metallic and show superconductivity , in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 low - temperature superconductivity at @xmath7 = 1.5 k condenses from a metallic state that is a strongly two - dimensional fermi liquid below about 20 k. the fermi surface consists of three weakly corrugated cylindrical sheets @xmath8 being hole - like and @xmath9 and @xmath10 which are electon - like @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 where only one fermi sheet exists .",
    "the mechanism of conduction in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 at higher temperatures is an interesting issue because the @xmath3-axis resistivity shows a broad maximum at around 130 k and for increasing temperatures the resistivity starts to decrease . in @xcite",
    "such a metallic to nonmetallic crossover in the @xmath3-axis resistivity of a highly anisotropic metal like sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 with no corresponding feature in the @xmath11-plane properties has been related to the strong coupling between the electrons and a bosonic mode propagating and polarized in @xmath3-direction , like the axial oxygen breathing mode @xmath12 , at the @xmath13 point of the brillouin zone ( bz ) to be discussed in .",
    "superconductivity in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is thought to be of unconventional character and thus is intensively discussed in the literature .",
    "the current state of the experiments points to triplet superconductivity in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 in contrast to the @xmath14-wave singlet pairing in the htsc s .",
    "most discussion of the superconducting mechanism for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is focussed on magnetic fluctuations and coulomb repulsion , for a review see @xcite .",
    "however , a contribution of electron - phonon interaction ( epi ) to pairing may not be ruled out because the superconducting transition exhibits a clear isotope effect @xcite . in case of the htsc s",
    "there is increasing evidence that epi is strong and phonons might play an important role for the electron dynamics , see @xcite , @xcite and references therein .",
    "thus , a detailed theoretical study of phonon dynamics in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 and a comparison with the situation in the htsc s is desirable .",
    "the low - temperature superconductor sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 crystallizes in the k@xmath0nif@xmath1 structure ( i4/mmm ) isostructural to the htsc la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .",
    "an analysis and comparison of the lattice dynamics in both materials is the main intention of the present work . for this purpose",
    "we compute the phonon dynamics for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 and oppose it with our earlier calculations for la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .",
    "the most characteristic feature of phonon dynamics in the htsc s is the strong softening upon doping of the high - frequency oxygen bond - stretching modes ( obsm ) which seems to be generic for @xmath4- as well as @xmath5-doped cuprates , see @xcite .",
    "the strong frequency renormalization and a related increase of the linewidths observed for these anomalous modes point to a strong coupling of the phonons to the charge dynamics . a discussion and theoretical investigations of these phonon anomalies",
    "are presented e.g. in @xcite . in agreement with inelastic neutron scattering @xcite our calculations demonstrate that the typical obsm phonon anomalies of the cuprates are not present in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "moreover the characteristic @xmath6 branch related to the strongly coupling @xmath12 mode in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 is missing .    in order to achieve reliable results for the @xmath6 phonon modes propagating and polarized along the @xmath3-axis a careful calculation of",
    "the proper polarization part of the density response function is crucial .",
    "this has already been shown for la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 in @xcite where we have proven that the @xmath6 modes are highly sensitive with respect to the charge response perpendicular to the cuo plane .",
    "the large anisotropy of the electronic structure of the cuprates is as a rule considerably underestimated in dft - lda calculations and as a consequence the @xmath6 modes are not well described .",
    "so we have modified a lda - based calculation for la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 to account for the much weaker @xmath2-dispersion of the electronic bandstructure in the real material .",
    "we have optimized the interlayer coupling in such a way that the significant features of the sensitive @xmath6 phonons are well described .",
    "the same route is followed in the present work for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 to get a realistic representation of the @xmath6 modes and in particular of @xmath12 which can not be described in the ionic shell - model taking additionally homogeneous electron gas screening into account @xcite .",
    "finally , we investigate the question if there is room for a phonon - plasmon scenario around the @xmath3-axis for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 which has been shown to be a realistic option in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 @xcite . due to",
    "the much weaker electronic @xmath2-dispersion obtained in our computations as compared to la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 , i.e. a much stronger anisotropy of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , the calculated free - plasmon frequencies along the @xmath3-axis are about a factor of eight smaller in the collisionless regime .",
    "damping , generated by interactions between the electrons as well as interband transitions which are on a much lower energy scale as for la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 very likely leads to overdamping of the plasmons propagating strictly along the @xmath3-axis in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "thus , different from la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 coupled @xmath3-axis phonon - plasmon modes should not be well defined collective excitations at least strictly along the @xmath15 direction and accordingly do not enter the list of possible players for pairing in contrast to la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in the theory necessary to understand the calculated results",
    "is shortly reviewed .",
    "presents the calculations .",
    "the modification of a lda - based electronic bandstructure providing the basis of the single particle content of the irreducible polarization part of the density response function is developed .",
    "furthermore , the phonon dispersion is calculated in adiabatic approximation for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 and a comparative discussion with the situation in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 is given . finally , in a nonadiabatic calculation the possibility of a phonon - plasmon scenario is examined .",
    "a summary of the paper is given in and the conclusions are drawn .",
    "in the following a brief survey of the theory and modeling is presented .",
    "a detailed description can be found in @xcite and in particular in @xcite where the calculation of the coupling parameters of the theory is presented .",
    "the local part of the electronic charge response and the epi is approximated in the spirit of the quasi - ion approach @xcite by an ab initio rigid ion model ( rim ) taking into account covalent ion softening in terms of ( static ) effective ionic charges calculated from a tight - binding analysis .",
    "the tight - binding analysis supplies these charges as extracted from the orbital occupation numbers @xmath16 of the @xmath17 ( tight - binding ) orbital in question : @xmath18 @xmath19 stands for the @xmath17-component of the eigenvector of band @xmath5 at the wavevector @xmath20 in the first bz ; the summation in runs over all occupied states and @xmath21 gives the number of the elementary cells in the ( periodic ) crystal .",
    "in addition , scaling of the short - ranged part of certain pair potentials between the ions is performed to simulate further covalence effects in the calculation in such a way that the energy - minimized structure is as close as possible to the experimental one @xcite .",
    "structure optimization and energy minimization is very important for a reliable calculation of the phonon dynamics through the dynamical matrix .",
    "taking just the experimental structure data as is done in many cases in the literature may lead to uncontrolled errors in the phonon calculations .",
    "the rim with the corrections just mentioned then serves as an unbiased reference system for the description of the htsc s and can be considered as a first approximation for the insulating state of these compounds .",
    "starting with such an unprejudiced rigid reference system non - rigid electronic polarization processes are introduced in form of more or less localized electronic charge - fluctuations ( cf s ) at the outer shells of the ions . especially in the metallic state of the htsc",
    "s the latter dominate the _",
    "nonlocal _ contribution of the electronic density response and the epi and are particularly important in the cuo planes and the ruo plane . in addition , _ anisotropic _ dipole - fluctuations ( df s ) are admitted in our approach @xcite , which prove to be specifically of interest for the ions in the ionic layers mediating the dielectric coupling and for the polar modes .",
    "thus , the basic variable of our model is the ionic density which is given in the perturbed state by @xmath22 @xmath23 is the density of the unperturbed ion , as used in the rim , localized at the sublattice @xmath8 of the crystal and moving rigidly with the latter under displacement .",
    "the @xmath24 and @xmath25 describe the amplitudes and the form - factors of the cf s and the last term in equation represents the dipolar deformation of an ion @xmath8 with amplitude ( dipole moment ) @xmath26 and a radial density distribution @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 denotes the unit vector in the direction of @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath25 are approximated by a spherical average of the orbital densities of the ionic shells calculated in lda taking self - interaction effects ( sic ) into account . the dipole density @xmath30 is obtained from a modified sternheimer method in the framework of lda - sic @xcite .",
    "all sic - calculations are performed for the average spherical shell in the orbital - averaged form according to perdew and zunger @xcite . for the correlation part of the energy per electron",
    "the parametrization given in @xcite has been used .",
    "the total energy of the crystal is obtained by assuming that the density can be approximated by a superposition of overlapping densities @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath23 in equation are also calculated within lda - sic taking environment effects , via a watson sphere potential and the calculated static effective charges of the ions into account .",
    "the watson sphere method is only used for the oxygen ions and the depth of the watson sphere potential is set as the madelung potential at the corresponding site .",
    "such an approximation holds well in the htsc s @xcite . finally , applying the pair - potential approximation we get for the total energy : @xmath32 the energy @xmath33 depends on both the configuration of the ions @xmath34 and the electronic ( charge ) degrees of freedom ( edf ) @xmath35 of the charge density , i.e. @xmath36 and @xmath37 in equation .",

    "both @xmath38 and @xmath41 in general depend upon @xmath42 via @xmath31 in equation .",
    "the pair potentials in equation can be seperated into long - ranged coulomb contributions and short - ranged terms , for details see e.g. ref @xcite .",

    "the @xmath51 coefficients describe the coupling between the edf and the displaced ions ( bare electron - phonon coupling ) , and the coefficients @xmath52 determine the interaction between the edf . the phonon frequencies @xmath53 and the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath54 of the modes @xmath55 are obtained from the secular equation for the dynamical matrix in equation , i.e. @xmath56 the eqs",
    ". - are generally valid and , in particular , are independent of the specific model for the decomposition of the perturbed density in equation and the pair approximation in equation for the energy .",
    "the lenghty details of the calculation of the coupling coefficients @xmath51 and @xmath52 can not be reviewed in this paper .",
    "they are presented in @xcite . in this context",
    "we remark that the coupling matrix @xmath57 of the edf - edf interaction , whose inverse appears in equation for the dynamical matrix , can be written in matrix notation as @xmath58 @xmath59 is the inverse of the _ irreducible ( proper ) polarization part _ of the density response function ( matrix ) and contains the kinetic part to the interaction @xmath52 while @xmath60 embodies the hartree and exchange - correlation contribution .",
    "@xmath61 needed for the dynamical matrix and the epi",
    "is closely related to the ( linear ) density response function ( matrix ) and to the inverse dielectric function ( matrix ) @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "only very few attempts have been made to calculate the phonon dispersion and the epi of the htsc s using the linear response method in form of density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt ) within lda @xcite .",
    "these calculations correspond to calculating @xmath63 and @xmath60 in dft - lda and for the _ metallic _ state only . on the other hand , in our microscopic modeling dft - lda - sic calculations",
    "are performed for the various densities in equation in order to obtain the coupling coefficients @xmath51 and @xmath60 .",
    "including sic is particularly important for localized orbitals like cu3d in the htsc s .",
    "our theoretical results for the phonon dispersion @xcite , which compare well with the experiments , demonstrate that the approximative calculation of the coupling coefficients in our approach is sufficient , even for the localized cu3d states .",
    "written in matrix notation we get for the density response matrix the relation @xmath64 the cf - cf submatrix of the matrix @xmath63 can approximatively be calculated for the metallic ( but not for the undoped and underdoped ) state of the htsc s from a tba of a single particle electronic bandstructure . in this case",

    "the self - consistent change of an edf at an ion induced by a phonon mode @xmath67 with frequency @xmath53 and eigenvector @xmath54 can be derived in the form @xmath68 e^{i{\\mathbf{q}}{\\mathbf{r}}_\\kappa^{\\mathbf{a}}}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\equiv & \\delta\\zeta_\\kappa({\\mathbf{q}}\\sigma)e^{i{\\mathbf{q}}{\\mathbf{r}}^{\\mathbf{a}}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the displacement of the ions @xmath69 the self - consistent response per unit displacement of the edf in equation is calculated in linear response theory as : @xmath70 the generalization for the quantity @xmath63 in eqs . and needed for the kinetic part of the charge response in the nonadiabatic regime , where dynamical screening effects must be considered , can be achieved by adding @xmath71 to the differences of the single - particle energies in the denominator of the expression for @xmath63 in equation .",
    "other possible nonadiabatic contributions to @xmath52 related to dynamical exchange - correlation effects and the phonons themselves are beyond the scope of the present approach . using equation for the dielectric matrix , @xmath72 , and the frequency - dependent version of the irreducible polarization part , @xmath63 , according to equation , the free - plasmon dispersion is obtained from the condition , @xmath73 = 0 .\\ ] ] the coupled - mode frequencies of the phonons and the plasmons must be determined self - consistently from the secular equation for the dynamical matrix which now contains the frequency @xmath74 implicitly via @xmath63 in the response function @xmath61 .",
    "such a nonadiabatic approach is necessary for a description of the interlayer phonons and the charge - response within a small region around the @xmath3-axis as performed in @xcite and in the present paper for sr@xmath75ruo@xmath76 .",

    "leads to a much better result for the phonon modes .",
    "the characteristic experimental features of the dispersion i.e. the step - like structure of the second highest branch and most significant the third highest branch with the steep dispersion towards the @xmath13 point are not well reflected by the calculation with the 31bm as input for the proper polarization part in equation .",

    "we obtain for the pdos at @xmath111 @xmath112 ev@xmath113 , @xmath114 ev@xmath113 , @xmath115 ev@xmath113 and @xmath116 ev@xmath113 .",
    "there are qualitative differences concerning the origin of hybridization comparing sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 with la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .",
    "hybridization in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is strongly favoured because the radial extent of the 4d wave functions in ru is much larger than for the 3d wave functions in cu .",
    "concurrently this leads to a weaker influence of electron correlation effects , e.g. a smaller on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath117 for ru4d compared to cu3d . in our calculations we find for @xmath117(cu3d ) = 1.005 dry and for @xmath117(ru4d ) = 0.619 dry . on the other hand ,",
    "hybridization is promoted in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 as compared to sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 because the energy levels of the copper and oxygen ions are close by in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 but far off between ruthenium and oxygen in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "a further remarkable difference of the bs in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 and la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 can be read off from and the bs for la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 in @xcite . in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 up to three bands close to each other are crossing the fermi level giving rise to a three - sheet fs while in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 only one band is crossing and other bands are more far away .",
    "thus we have a completely different situation as _ interband transitions _ are concerned which are on a much lower energy scale in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 as in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .",
    "so we find for @xmath118 with @xmath119 for @xmath46 at the @xmath13 point in case of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 a minimum of 20.67 mev in the m27bm2 around @xmath120 , see also , while in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 we obtain for the @xmath13 point at @xmath121 a minimum of 452.71 mev .",
    "this , of course , has important consequences for the contribution of the interband transitions to @xmath78 in equation concerning magnitude as well as energy scale .    for example",
    "the low energy scale of the interband transitions in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 can generate damping of possible plasmons already at very low energy .",
    "such a damping already present in the collisionless regime together with additional damping due to interactions between the electrons very likely leads to overdamping of the very low lying plasmons in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 along the @xmath3-axis .",
    "the energy of the latter in the collisionless regime is only 5 - 6 mev along the @xmath110 direction as will be shown in .",
    "thus , the degree of the remaining weak three - dimensionality quantified by our computations is also very important for a possible existence of plasmons and coupled phonon - plasmon modes around the @xmath3-axis .",
    "such modes have been predicted for la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 in our recent calculations @xcite which , however , is not so anisotropic as sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 and the plasmons along the @xmath3-axis are at higher frequencies that overdamping can be avoided .    in figure [ fig_efsurf_xy](a ) and",
    "( b ) , respectively , the calculated fs in the @xmath101 plane is shown for the m27bm2 and the 27bm , together with the experimental data points @xcite .",
    "the fs consists of the sheets @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath8 sheet is holelike and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are electronlike .",
    "the @xmath10 sheet is dominantly derived from the ru4d@xmath95 orbitals , the @xmath8 and @xmath9 sheets are primarily related to the 4d@xmath122 and 4d@xmath123 orbitals of ru which exhibit anticrossing behaviour along the zone diagonal .",
    "the large electronlike @xmath10 sheet passes right through the hybridization gap between the @xmath8 and @xmath9 sheets .",
    "the experimental results are not well described by the 27bm in ( b ) .",
    "in particular the crossing between the @xmath9 and @xmath10 sheet in the 27bm which is typical forlda calculations is experimentally not reproduced .",
    "this is really a crossing and not an anticrossing as for @xmath101 the bands related to d@xmath95 and d@xmath122/d@xmath123 oribitals have different symmetry and no mixing is allowed .",
    "on the other hand , our modified bs model m27bm2 in ( a ) is in good agreement with the experimental fs .    in order to obtain also a more global impression of the magnitude of the enhanced anisotropy in the m27bm2",
    "as compared to the 27bm we compare some fs parameters being important for transport like the drude plasma energy tensor and the fermi velocity tensor .",
    "the drude tensor ist defined as @xmath124 and the fermi velocity is given by @xmath125 with @xmath126    @*7l & @xmath127 & @xmath128 & @xmath129 & @xmath130 & @xmath131 & @xmath132 27bm & 1045.94 & 65.50 & 6.63 & 0.88 & 15.97 & 7.53 + m27bm2 & 1017.40 & 3.57 & 6.03 & 0.08 & 284.99 & 75.38 + m31bm & 648.60 & 25.25 & 2.99 & 0.11 & 25.69 & 27.18    the output of our calculation for the 27bm and the m27bm2 is given in .",
    "as can be seen we obtain a large enhancement of the anisotropy ratio for the plasma frequencies @xmath133 and of the fermi velocities @xmath132 by about a factor 18 and 10 , respectively , in the m27bm2 as compared to the lda - based 27bm .",
    "additionally , we have included in the corresponding calculated data for la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "again we recognize the by far larger anisotropy of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 also in the transport properties .",
    "the values for @xmath134 and @xmath135 are significantly increased in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .",
    "in this section we investigate the phonon dynamics of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 in the main symmetry directions @xmath94 , @xmath136 and @xmath15 and continue our discussion from of a comparison of important characteristica as found in our earlier calculations for la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .    for a definite investigation of the phonon renormalization induced by the _ nonlocal _ epi effects of df and cf type mediated by the second term in equation a quantitative reference model for the calculation of the phonon dispersion not including the nonlocal screening effects but representing the important ionic component of binding in the material",
    "is needed . such a model sketched in including approximately the _ local _ epi effects",
    "is provided by the ab initio rim extended via covalent ion softening and scaling of certain short - ranged pair potentials .",
    "ruo@xmath1 for the rim in the main symmetry directions @xmath94 , @xmath136 and @xmath15 . the various symbols representing the experimental results are from @xcite and indicate different irreducible representations .",
    "the arrangement of the panels from left to right according to the different irreducible representations is as follows : @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 . ]",
    "the result of the phonon dispersion along the main symmetry directions is shown for the rim in and compared with the experimental data from inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) @xcite .",
    "the static effective charges found for the model are ru@xmath141 , o@xmath142 , o@xmath143 and sr@xmath144 .",
    "in particular the charges of ru and o@xmath95 differ considerably from their nominal values ru@xmath145 and o@xmath146 .",
    "this is due to the strong hybridization of the ru4d and o@xmath952p states that reduces the amplitude of the static effective charges in a mixed ionic - covalent compound like sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 because of the charge transfer ( ct ) from the cations to the anions is not complete as in the entirely ionic case .",
    "consistent with the result of the effective ionic charges is an enhanced covalent character of the ru - o@xmath95 plane with a dominant covalent scaling of the ru - o@xmath95 potential and a more ionic character of the sr - o@xmath96 layer with an ionic scaling of the sr - o@xmath96 potential as found in the calculations .",
    "altogether the rim with these modifications yields good structural data for the energy - minimized configuration . in detail",
    "we get for the planar lattice constant @xmath147 , for the lattice constant along the @xmath3-axis @xmath148 and for the internal position of the o@xmath96 and the sr ion @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "the experimental values at 15 k are @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 @xcite . from these data",
    "we extract that the tetragonal distortion of the ruo@xmath155 octahedra is significantly smaller than for the cuo@xmath155 octahedra in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .",
    "the ratio of the in - plane to out - of - plane distance of the oxygen is 0.9196 in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 but 0.7706 in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .",
    "the phonon dispersion of the rim is in reasonable agreement with the experiment as far as the branches with lower frequencies are concerned .",
    "this points to the importance of the ionic component of binding in this material .",
    "large deviations are observed for the modes with higher frequencies .",
    "in particular the high - frequency obsm @xmath106 , o@xmath156 and @xmath12 , see figure [ fig_evs ] , are not well described .",
    "the corresponding frequencies are overestimated as compared with the full calculation including df s and cf s by about 5.8 thz , 7.4 thz and 6.7 thz , respectively .",
    "this can be attributed according to our approach to the missing screening of the coulomb interaction by df s and most importantly by cf s .",
    "noticeable is the soft @xmath157 mode at the @xmath158 point and the very low frequency of the branch in the measurements ( the notation for the irreducible representations characterizing the symmetry of the modes @xmath157 and @xmath159 is interchanged with the notation of @xcite ) .",
    "this mode is associated with the rotation of ruo@xmath155 octahedra around the @xmath3-axis . as indicated by our calculations",
    "the softness of the rotational mode can be considered as a precursor of a structural phase transition which in the meanwhile has been observed in the ca@xmath160sr@xmath161ruo@xmath1 series @xcite . from our calculation in the rim",
    "this transition can be expected to be driven essentially by the strong component of the ionic forces in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "contrarily , sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 does not experience the tilt instability related to the @xmath159 branch at the @xmath158 point found in our calculations for la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .",
    "this instability correctly indicates the experimentally observed structural phase transition from the high - temperature tetragonal ( htt ) to the low - temperature orthorhombic ( lto ) structure .",
    "also this transition is mainly brought about by the long - ranged ionic forces .",
    "substituting the smaller isovalent ca ions for the sr ions induces a misfit between the ca and ru ions and generates a close connection between the rotation of the ruo@xmath155 octahedra and the electronic and magnetic properties in the ca@xmath160sr@xmath161 ruo@xmath1 series @xcite . besides the softening of the rotational mode in the range @xmath162 around @xmath163 a similar structural transition occurs due to the softening of the ruo@xmath155 tilt mode @xcite . in this context",
    "it is interesting that at @xmath164 in the paramagnetic phase of ca@xmath165sr@xmath166ruo@xmath1 the @xmath10 fermi sheet gains a remarkable @xmath2-dispersion and thus a more three - dimensional character than sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this issue also emphasizes an interrelation between the electronic @xmath2-dispersion and the ruo@xmath155 distortions .",
    "ruo@xmath1 . ]    in we display the calculated results of the phonon dispersion admitting additionally to the rim anisotropic df s .",
    "this leads to a better agreement of the dispersion curves with the inelastic neutron results . checking these calculations against the rim the width of the spectrum",
    "is reduced towards the experiment .",
    "the frequencies of the transverse and longitudinal optical @xmath167 modes polarized in the plane are decreased by the df s and thereby the largest lo - to splitting is reduced at the @xmath108-point from 8.8 thz in the rim to 6.3 thz when dipolar polarization processes are included . at the same time the frequencies of the @xmath86 modes at @xmath108 and @xmath13 are lowered considerably by the df s in @xmath168-direction and the large splitting of the @xmath102(ferro ) mode of 10.13 thz in the rim is reduced to 8.85 thz .",
    "the high - frequency obsm @xmath106 , @xmath169 and @xmath81 are also decreased due to the screening by the df s but are still overestimated by about 3.9 thz , 5.1 thz and 4 thz as compared with the full calculation displayed in including additionally cf s .",
    "thus , the softening of these modes compared with the rim is of the order 2 - 3 thz and the remaining effect of the renormalization can be assigned to the cf s on the ru4d and o@xmath952p orbitals .",

    "because of the weak screening along the @xmath3-axis and the corresponding large strength of the nonlocal epi we can expect these vibrations to induce cf s in the ruo layers , see for the calculated results .",
    "however , the cf s differ qualitatively between @xmath12 and @xmath104 , respectively , because for the @xmath108-point vibrations the following sum rule can be derived for the cf s @xmath179 @xcite , @xmath180     mode calculated according to equation for the m27bm2 .",

    "the sum over @xmath50 in equation runs over the cf s in an elementary cell of the crystal and @xmath183 denotes the various eigenmodes at @xmath108 .",
    "physically equation means that _ local charge neutrality _ of the elementary cell is maintained in the long - wavelength limit @xmath184 , i.e. the mode induced ct is organized within the cell such that from the outside the cell looks electrically neutral .",
    "equation puts a strong constraint on the possible ct in the cell and thus on the screening by cf s .",
    "this restriction explains the small renormalization of the frequency of only 0.581 thz of @xmath104 in relation to @xmath12 where the renormalization due to cf s is 4.046 thz .",
    "in @xcite the pronounced softening and the broadening of @xmath81 is attributed to a strong coupling between this phonon and an interlayer charge transport .",
    "such an interpretation is supported by our calculations for @xmath12 where the cf s can be read off from and the ct is illustrated in in terms of the nonlocal part of the displacement induced rearrangement of the charge density according to @xmath185 the cf s @xmath186 in equation are obtained from equation and the form - factors from equation .",
    "in contrast to the constraint for @xmath104 expressed by equation no such restriction must be satistfied in the metallic phase for @xmath12 . while in @xmath104",
    "only an _ intracell _ ct is allowed summing up to zero , @xmath81 generates cf s of the same sign in the cell ( ) . this finally leads to cf s of alternating sign in consecutive ruo layers ( cells ) , i.e. an _ interlayer ( intercell ) _ ct is set up , see also .",
    "the latter provides an effective screening mechanism of the coulomb interaction and explains the strong renormalization of @xmath81 as compared with @xmath104 .    in the adiabatic approximation used in the calculations so far",
    "the interlayer ct is instantaneous .",

    "we do not go into the details of these computations here but what is important concerning the question of overdamping is that for @xmath229 in case of the @xmath230 direction and for @xmath231 in the @xmath232 direction the free - plasmon frequency is larger than 7 thz , the estimated value for the phonon - plasmon scenario to exist . from the calculations we find that the longitudinal @xmath102(ferro , na ) mode at @xmath108 ( ( a ) ) is virtually unchanged at @xmath233 and so does exist around 19 thz .",
    "the same holds true for @xmath81(na ) at the @xmath13 point being practically the same as @xmath234 for @xmath235 in the @xmath232 direction .",
    "similar as for la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 @xcite with increasing @xmath72 @xmath102(ferro , na ) and @xmath236(na ) rapidly leave the spectrum to high frequencies .    in case of @xmath236(na )",
    "this mode behaviour can also be extracted from ( b ) where we have presented our calculated results of the dispersion of the coupled phonon - plasmon @xmath237 modes along the @xmath238 direction from @xmath239 to @xmath240 for @xmath241 .",
    "the highest mode at @xmath13 is the @xmath12(na ) mode also seen in ( a ) as a black dot .",
    "the broken line is the dispersion of the free - plasmon branch calculated from equation and the dotted line is the borderline for damping due to electron - hole decay investigated from @xmath242 for the bands crossing the fermi level . from this figure",
    "the range of the region with a nonadiabatic charge response can be estimated .",
    "it is characterized by the steep branch which ultimately converges to the frequency of the adiabatic @xmath12 mode ( black dot at @xmath221 ) .",
    "similar as in la@xmath75cuo@xmath76 this nonadiabatic region is very small and can be estimated from the figure at about @xmath243 . unlike the case of la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 the phonon - plasmon dispersion in",
    "( b ) should not exist in the full range of frequencies according to our estimate for overdamping below about 7 thz .",
    "parallel to the investigation of the @xmath12 mode in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 @xcite , the line - broadening of this mode observed by @xcite in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 can be understood from the calculated phonon - plasmon scenario .",
    "experimentally there is a limited wave vector resolution in ins for the transverse direction perpendicular to the @xmath3-axis which for the experiments in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 is on the average @xmath244 @xcite .",
    "thus , the relevant frequency range sampled in the measurement for @xmath81 is over the steep branch beyond which the mode develops an @xmath12-like displacement pattern .",
    "according to the calculations this sampling occurs for mode frequencies larger than 12.5 thz and leads to a corresponding broadening of the linewidth for @xmath81 observed in the experiment .    because the region with a metallic adiabatic charge response outweights by a factor of roughly three the nonadiabatic region we can attribute to the @xmath12 mode an adiabatic frequency of about 15.3 thz .",
    "the @xmath217 branch starting at @xmath12(na ) in ( b ) has not been observed in the experiments so far because a very high @xmath46-space solution transverse to the @xmath3-axis would be needed to resolve the mode dispersion in the small nonadiabatic sector .",
    "in @xcite we have pointed out for la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 the relevance of a strongly coupling nonadiabatic @xmath12 mode .",
    "so it is interesting to see if such a large epi also exists for @xmath81(na ) in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 . as a parameter for the strength of the epi in a certain mode @xmath55 we have used in the past the orbital averaged changes of the selfconsistent crystal potential @xmath245 , @xcite . in case of la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 we obtain in units of mev @xmath246 and @xmath247 which should be compared with the considerably reduced strength @xmath248 and @xmath249 in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "altogether , we conclude from our calculations for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 that nonadiabatic epi via phonon - plasmon coupling is not possible strictly along the @xmath3-axis but most likely away from this axis in a very small region at higher free - plasmon frequencies .",
    "moreover , the strength is significantly smaller as in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .",
    "we have argued above that the longitudinal ferroelectric @xmath102(ferro , na ) mode exists in the nonadiabatic sector around the @xmath108 point at about 19 thz .",
    "this nonadiabatic result helps to understand why @xmath3-axis optical activity seen in the experiments @xcite is possible despite the fact that sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is in the metallic phase . in @xcite three @xmath3-polarized @xmath86 phonon structures at 6.04 thz , 10.88 thz and 14.51 thz",
    "have been detected which agree well with the calculated transverse @xmath102 modes in the m27bm2 at 5.16 thz , 10.42 thz and 14.49 thz .",
    "the by far largest oscillator strength is obtained for the mode at 10.88 thz and according to our calculation this is the ferroelectric mode @xmath102(ferro ) .",
    "consistent with the large oscillator strength of this mode in the experiment our nonadiabatic result for the longitudinal ferroelectric mode @xmath250 ( ferro , na ) predicts a very large @xmath86 splitting of about 9 thz .",
    "this splitting dominates the infrared response for polarization along the @xmath3-axis .",
    "further we find in the calculations two other longitudinal @xmath86 modes at 12.379 thz and 6.964 thz which define corresponding splittings with the transverse modes above .    from a theoretical point of view",
    "it is important to remark that optical activity in the metallic phase can not be explained using the adiabatic approximation for a calculation of the phonon dispersion as is commonly done by applying static dft for the metal @xcite . in such calculations",
    "there will be no lo - to or @xmath86 splittings being a measure for the oscillator strength because the transverse effective charges vanish if the metallic phase is treated in adiabatic approximation and consequently the induced dipole moments defining the oscillator strength in the dielectric function ( matrix ) vanish too .",
    "thus , there will be no optical activity in a metal by the phonons treated in adiabatic approximation which underlies static dft .",
    "we have shown that for a reliable description of the @xmath3-axis charge response in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 and in particular the phonon dynamics along this axis a typical lda - based model is too isotropic and must be modified to account for the much weaker interlayer coupling in the real material .",
    "similar as in the cuprates studied earlier the large anisotropy in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is considerably underestimated in dft - lda calculations of the electronic bs .    from our investigations",
    "we conclude that an accurate representation of the very fainty @xmath2-dispersion of the bs nevertheless is essential to understand the @xmath3-axis polarized @xmath6 modes . while the lda - based model ( 27bm ) is insufficient a modified much more anisotropic model ( m27bm2 ) is well suited .    we have examined the multi - sheet fs of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 with the two models and found that the experimental results for the fs are not well described within the 27bm . on the other hand",
    ", the m27bm2 shows a good agreement with the measured fs .",
    "this model can be considered to represent the real anisotropy in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 sufficiently well .",
    "we have also calculated the magnitude of the strongly enhanced anisotropy in the m27bm2 compared with the 27bm more globally in terms of some fermi surface parameters important for transport properties .",
    "checking both models against each other we find an enhancement of about a factor 18 for the anisotropy ratio of the drude plasma energy tensor and of about a factor of 10 for the fermi velocity tensor .",
    "while the calculations demonstrate that sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is a nearly two - dimensional fermi liquid significantly more anisotropic than la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 the remaining very weak three - dimensionality is crucial to achieve a solid representation of the @xmath3-axis charge response and of certain @xmath3-axis phonons .",
    "we have calculated in detail the phonon dispersion in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 along the main symmetry directions in the bz and compared the result with the dispersion of the htsc la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 being structural isomorphic .",
    "a good overall agreement of the calculated results is found for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 with the ins data . comparing the results of the calculated phonon dynamics in the rim with a model allowing additional df s and",
    "finally the full model including df s and cf s the renormalization of certain modes which are strongly coupled via nonlocal epi effects of df- and cf - type has been analyzed in detail . in this context",
    "an important point of the comparison with la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 is that the anomalous softening of the high - frequency oxygen bond - stretching modes , being generic for the cuprate based htsc s , is strongly reduced or completely absent in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 depending primarily on the magnitude of the on - site coulomb repulsion of the ru4d orbitals .",
    "we have also investigated the possibility of a kohn anomaly in the @xmath187 modes of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 as discussed in the literature . in our calculations",
    "we do not find any evidence for such an anomaly driven by nesting of the fs .",
    "instead , the dip in the lowest @xmath187 branch seen in the experiments is well explained in our computations by an anticrossing effect of the three lowest @xmath187 branches .",
    "finally , we have examined the question of a possible phonon - plasmon scenario in a small region of nonadiabatic charge response around the @xmath3-axis which has been shown to be a realistic option in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .",
    "due to the much weaker electronic @xmath2-dispersion obtained for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 the calculated free - plasmon frequencies along the @xmath3-axis are about a factor of eight smaller in the collisionless regime than in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .",
    "we have argued that damping generated by the interactions between the qp s as well as interband transitions which are at much lower energy scale than in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 leads to an overdamping of the plasmon strictly along the @xmath3-axis in contrast to la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .",
    "however , a coupled phonon - plasmon scenario becomes likely also in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 at higher free - plasmon frequencies .",
    "this occurs in case the wavevector is not strictly parallel to the @xmath3-axis but has a small transverse component .",
    "we find that the strength of this nonlocal nonadiabatic coupling is significantly weaker than in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .",
    "ultimately we have explained by our calculations of the nonadiabatic charge response the linewidth of the apex oxygen breathing mode at the @xmath13 point and why @xmath3-axis optical activity as seen in the experiments is possible despite the fact that sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is in the metallic phase .",
