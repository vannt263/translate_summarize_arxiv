    "cp phenomenology is sensitive to new physics beyond the standard model . in supersymmeteric models ,",
    "there appear new cp violating phases which arise from the complexity of the soft supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking terms , i.e. the trilinear scalar @xmath0-terms , the bilinear scalar @xmath1-term and the majorana gaugino masses , as well as from the @xmath2 parameter .",
    "the presence of these phases would give large contributions , e.g. , to the electric dipole moment of the neutron ( edmn ) @xcite and to the cp violation parameters ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) of the @xmath5 system @xcite .",
    "there has been a considerable amount of work concerning these phases in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "it was shown that to suppress the edmn , either large scalar masses ( approaching more than 1 tev ) or small cp phases ( of order @xmath6 , when all susy masses are of order 100 gev ) are required . in the latter case ,",
    "the mssm susy phases generate cp violation in the @xmath5 system far below the experimental value .",
    "thus , the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) phase must provide almost the whole contrbituion to the observed cp violation in the @xmath7-system .",
    "0.3 cm recently the question whether the edmn actually forces the susy contributions to cp violation in the @xmath7 system to be quite small has been vigorously readdressed .",
    "in particular this has been due to a change in the perspectives of the susy model - building .",
    "while in the 80 s and early 90 s most emphasis was put on the minimal susy extension of the sm ( i.e. the mssm ) , more recently it has become clear that the mssm represents a very particular choice of susy extension of the sm with drastic assumptions on the susy breaking terms .",
    "the advent of superstring inspired model has even more stressed the particular nature of the mssm and the difficulty , in general , to obtain all the strict boundary conditions on which the mssm relies . if one gives up the mssm and goes for more general susy realizations it is possible to avoid the above obstruction on large susy contributions to @xmath3 .",
    "0.3 cm three ways out have been indiduated so far .",
    "first , even remaining within the mssm context , the complete computation of the susy contributions to the edmn involves several contributions and possible destructive interferences can occur in some regions of the susy parameter space @xcite .",
    "a second possibility occurs in the so - called models of effective supersymmetries where the sfermion of the first two generations are very heavy ( in the tens of tev range ) while those of the third generation remain light . here",
    "the susy contributions to the edmn are suppressed even with the maximal susy phases either because the squarks in the loop are very heavy or because the mixing angles are very small @xcite . finally , we come to the way out which is of most immediate interest in our work .",
    "it relies on the non - universality of the trilinear @xmath0 terms of the soft breaking sector of the susy lagrangian @xcite .",
    "let us expand more on this latter possibility .",
    "0.3 cm in most of analysis universal or degenerate @xmath0-terms have been assumed , i.e. , @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "this is certainly a nice simplifying assumption , but it removes some interesting degrees of freedom . for example , every @xmath0-term would , in general have an independent cp phase , and in principle we would have @xmath10 independent cp phases . however , in the universal assumption only one independent cp phase is allowed .",
    "0.3 cm the situation drastically changes if we are to allow for non - degenerate a terms with different and independent cp phases . for example ,",
    "the off - diagonal element of the squark ( mass)@xmath11 matrix , say @xmath12 , includes the term proportinal to @xmath13 .",
    "however , in the universal or the degenerate case this term is always real .",
    "furthermore , these off - diagonal elements play an important role in @xmath14 , as shall be shown later .",
    "if these terms enlarge the imaginary part of @xmath12 , cp violation in the @xmath7-system may be enhanced . that such a case may occur",
    "was recently shown in ref.@xcite .",
    "0.3 cm in this paper we study more explicitly and concretely such aspects of the cp violation in the @xmath7-system due to nondegenerate @xmath0-terms , using soft susy breaking parameters derived from superstring models with certain assumptions @xcite .",
    "we assume real yukawa matrices in order to study the cp violation effect due to susy cp phases .",
    "also we use generically realistic yukawa matrices .",
    "we investigate how much the cp violation parameter @xmath3 in the @xmath7-system is enhanced by the effect due to nondegenerate @xmath0-terms .",
    "0.3 cm the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the soft susy breaking terms derived from superstring models .",
    "we assign family - dependent modular weights in order to have nondegenerate trilinear couplings . in section 3 ,",
    "we study the effect of these phases in the cp violating physics of kaons .",
    "we show that susy cp phases could contribute to the observed value of @xmath3 in the @xmath7-system .",
    "section 4 deals with the edmn .",
    "we give our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "first we give a brief review on the soft susy breaking terms in string models , @xmath15 where @xmath16 , the @xmath17 are the scalar parts of the chiral superfields @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the gauginos .",
    "we assume the string model to have the same massless matter content of the mssm ,  three families of quark doublets @xmath20 , the up - type quark singlets @xmath21 , the down - type quark singlets @xmath22 , lepton doublets @xmath23 and lepton singlets @xmath24 as well as two higgs fields , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . here",
    "we consider orbifold models with the overall moduli field @xmath27 as well as the dilaton field @xmath28 .",
    "we assume that the dilaton and the moduli fields contribute to susy breaking and the vacuum energy vanishes . 0.3 cm in this case the soft scalar masses @xmath29 and the gaugino masses @xmath30 are written as @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the gravitino mass",
    ", @xmath33 is the modular weight of the chiral multiplet and @xmath34 corresponds to a ratio between @xmath35-terms of @xmath28 and @xmath27 .",
    "for example , the limit @xmath36 corresponds to the dilaton - dominant susy breaking . here",
    "the phase @xmath37 is originated from the @xmath35-term of @xmath28 . in the equation for @xmath30 the @xmath27-dependent threshold corrections are neglected .",
    "these latter are important only for the case where the tree level value is very small , i.e. , @xmath38 . here",
    "we do not discuss such limit .",
    "similarly the @xmath0-terms are written as @xmath39 where @xmath33 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are modular weights of fields in the corresponding yukawa coupling @xmath42 . here",
    "the phase @xmath43 is originated from the @xmath35-term of @xmath27 . and @xmath43 as free paremeters . if we fix a form of the susy breaking superpotential , these magnitudes can be fixed @xcite . ]",
    "if @xmath42 depends on @xmath27 , there appears another contribution .",
    "however , we do not take such case .",
    "0.3 cm thus , the gaugino masses and the @xmath0-terms as well as the @xmath1-term are , in general , complex .",
    "we have a degree of freedom to rotate @xmath30 and @xmath44 at the same time  @xcite . here",
    "we use the basis where @xmath30 is real . in @xmath0-terms of the above basis , there remains only one independent degree of freedom of the phase , i.e. , @xmath45 .",
    "however , note that in general @xmath0-terms can have different phases each other except the case with @xmath46 . the case with @xmath47 corresponds to the dilaton dominant susy breaking leading to the universal @xmath0-term , while the case with @xmath48 corresponds to the moduli - dominant susy breaking , where cp phases are universal , i.e. , @xmath49 .",
    "0.3 cm in order to avoid any conflict with the experimental results on flavor changing neutral current processes , we assume that the soft scalar masses of the first and second families are degenerate , that is , the first and second families have the same modular weights . under this assumption , we in general have the @xmath0-parameter matrix , @xmath50 that is , all of the entries in the first @xmath51 block are degenerate , and the ( 1,3 ) and ( 2,3 ) ( ( 3,1 ) and ( 3,2 ) ) entries are degenerate each other . after assigning specific modular weights",
    ", we obtain explicit values for the entries in the @xmath0-parameter matrix . 0.3 cm in addition to the soft terms",
    ", we have to fix the yukawa matrices to be able to perform an explicit computation .",
    "there are several types of anstze for realistic yukawa matrices .",
    "some typical yukawa matrices leading to approximate values of quark masses and their mixing angles are enough for our purpose . here",
    "we assume 1 ) every entry in the yukawa matrix is real , 2 ) the yukawa matrix is symmetric and 3 ) the yukawa matrix has the following hierarchical structure , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is any entry except @xmath54 and @xmath55 denotes the ( 1,1 ) , ( 1,2 ) and ( 2,1 ) entries .",
    "0.3 cm under these assumptions , we can write a generic form of the down - yukawa matrix , @xmath56 and the up - yukawa matrix , @xmath57 in terms of the eight free parameters , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , while @xmath62 is of order one .",
    "in addition we have a constraint , @xmath63 .",
    "a detailed discussion of this parametrization will be given in ref.@xcite .",
    "0.3 cm actually , most of symmetric and hierarchical yukawa mass matrices which have been already proposed in the literature are included in the above textures ( 7 ) and ( 8) .",
    "for example , five types of symmetric yukawa matrices with five texture zeros have been obtained in ref.@xcite .",
    "the following parameter assignments correspond to four ramond - roberts - ross ( rrr ) types , @xmath64 with the other prameters @xmath65 suppressed .. ] moreover , in ref.@xcite string - inspired realistic quark mass matrices have been studied and the obtained matrices correspond to the case with @xmath66 , a small value of @xmath67 and the other @xmath65 suppressed .",
    "as an example of non - universal cases , we take @xmath68 for the third family and @xmath69 for the first and second families .",
    "also we assume that @xmath70 and @xmath71 . in this case",
    ", we find the following texture for the @xmath0-parameter matrix at the string scale @xmath72 where @xmath73 in this paper we take @xmath74 and @xmath75 as an example . having specified the values of the soft terms at the string scale , we can use the electroweak breaking conditions at @xmath76 , which at tree level can be expressed as , @xmath77 @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the higgs fields . using eqs.([electro1 ] ) and ( [ electro2 ] ) we can determine the value of @xmath80 and @xmath81 as functions on @xmath32 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "we impose @xmath84 to avoid large edms .",
    "the origin of this latter phase is linked to the way the @xmath2 term is produced in effective supergravities .",
    "given the focus of our paper on the role of non - universal @xmath0-terms for cp violation , we are not going to discuss the different mechanisms to originate @xmath2 and we simply consider a vanishing @xmath85 .",
    "we also assume a low value of @xmath79 , namely we consider it to be of order 3 .",
    "then all the supersymmetric particle spectrum is completely determined in terms of @xmath32 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "apart from the key - role of the non - universal a - terms and of their phases in cp violation , it is worth mentioning that they have also important effects on the susy spectrum and on the non - cp violating processes  @xcite and  @xcite 0.3 cm before computing the contribution to cp violation in the kaon system from the phases in the above matrices @xmath86 and @xmath87 , one important remark is in order .",
    "the fact of having non - degenerate a - terms is essential to obtain non - vanishing cp violating contributions from susy loops when the ckm matrix is taken to be real .",
    "namely , it can be shown that , independently from how large one takes the susy cp phases @xmath88 and @xmath85 , in the presence of degenerate a - terms and real ckm there is no way of generating a phenomenologically viable amount of cp violation in k physics .",
    "this point was already emphasized by abel and frere @xcite who showed explicitly that @xmath3 turns out to be extremely tiny in box - diagrams with chargino / up - squark exchange and external left - handed quarks when the matrices @xmath89 in our notation are symmetric ( notice that the symmetric form of the trilinear matrcies @xmath90 and @xmath91 and the yukawas matrices @xmath92 and @xmath93 in our case is at the gut scale and indeed at weak scale our trilinear scalar terms are not symmetric in generation space since they have different running ) .",
    "their proof can be readily extended to susy loops with gluino exchange .",
    "this can be seen as follow .",
    "0.3 cm the value of the indirect cp violation in the kaon decays , @xmath3 , is defined as @xmath94 where @xmath95 gev .",
    "the amplitude @xmath96 is given in ref.@xcite in terms of the mass insertion @xmath97 defined by @xmath98 where @xmath99 is an average sfermion mass and the @xmath100 s denote off - diagonal , flavor changing terms in the sfermion mass matrices .",
    "0.3 cm we consider gluino exchange contributions with all external left - handed quarks . in this case",
    "the relevant flavor changing mass insertions that appear on the internal squark propagator lines accomplish the transition from @xmath101 to @xmath102 ( @xmath103 and @xmath104 are flavor indices ) : @xmath105_{12},\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the kobayashi - maskawa matrix . 0.3 cm in the case of",
    "degenerate a - terms , i.e. @xmath106 , one obtains@xcite @xmath107 , the flavor changing mass insertions remain real ( for real ckm matrix ) independently from the phase @xmath88 . in such diagonal or degenerate cases",
    "the susy contribution to cp violation relies on the @xmath108 and @xmath109 mass insertions and it turns out to be very small @xcite .",
    "obviously this is no longer true if we switch on the cp violating phase of the ckm matrix . in that case",
    "susy loops can give a non - negligible contribution to @xmath14 , although such contribution can not be the major source of cp violation .",
    "0.3 cm to obtain a large susy contribution to @xmath3 , it is necessary to enhance the values of @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the non - degenerate a - terms is an interesting example for enhancing these quantities since the off - diagonal terms , namely @xmath112 , lead to non vanishing value of @xmath108 and @xmath109 at the tree level ( see eq.(1 ) ) .",
    "0.3 cm we consider the box diagrams which are responsible for the @xmath113 transition and we focus on the contribution coming from gluino exchange in the loop ( as we shall see below this turns out to be the dominant contribution to @xmath3 ) @xcite : @xmath114          \\nonumber \\\\          & + &   \\left(\\delta^d_{12}\\right)^2_{lr }          \\left [   -132 \\left(\\frac{m_{k}}{m_{s}+m_{d}}\\right)^{2 } x\\ , f_6(x ) \\right ]          \\nonumber \\\\          & + &   \\left(\\delta^d_{12}\\right)^2_{rl }          \\left [   -132 \\left(\\frac{m_{k}}{m_{s}+m_{d}}\\right)^{2 } x\\ , f_6(x ) \\right ]          \\nonumber \\\\          & + & \\left(\\delta^d_{12}\\right)_{lr}\\left(\\delta^d_{12}\\right)_{rl }          \\left [ -144 \\left(\\frac{m_{k}}{m_{s}+m_{d}}\\right)^{2 } -84 \\right ]          \\tilde{f}_6(x )          \\biggr\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath115 and the functions @xmath116 are given in ref.@xcite .",
    "the above result is obtained in the so - called superkm basis @xcite by making use of the mass insertion approximation method .",
    "0.3 cm as we mentioned , we assume that the ckm matrix is real and the soft susy breaking terms are the only source for the complexity of the amplitude @xmath117 .",
    "the relevant contribution to cp violation comes from the terms proportional to @xmath108 and @xmath109 in the above expression .",
    "going to the basis where the down quark mass matrix is diagonal , the mass insertion @xmath108 is given by : @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the matrix diagonalizing the symmetric down quark mass matrix .",
    "the most relevant contributions in the above equation are @xmath120 which implies that im@xmath121 is of the same order as im@xmath122 and indeed it is found to be of order @xmath123 and the same for @xmath109 .",
    "moreover the values of i m @xmath124 and im@xmath125 are non zero unlike in the universal case , but are smaller than @xmath108 .",
    "0.3 cm also we estimate the chargino contribution to @xmath3 .",

    "the values of @xmath126 are two order of magnitude larger than the values of @xmath129 but because of the smallness of the coupling it is found that the amplitude of the chargino contribution is one order of magnitude less than the gluino amplitude . thus the main contribution to @xmath3 is due to the gluino exchange . however , this is not necessarily true in the case of non - vanishing @xmath85",
    ". 0.3 cm using the above values of the mass insertions we can determine the susy contribution to @xmath3 .",

    "0.3 cm    0.3 cm also we give the values of @xmath133 in terms of @xmath82 in fig .",
    "2 , which shows that the non - universality between the soft supersymmetry breaking terms is preferred to enhance the susy cp violating contribution .",
    "0.3 cm    0.3 cm finally we present the values of @xmath133 as a function of the gravitino mass in fig .",
    "+ 0.3 cm    0.3 cm it is interesting to note that for @xmath134 gev we obtain large values of @xmath133 , which even exceed the experimental limit @xmath135 .",
    "thus we have a constraint on @xmath136 from the experimental limit on @xmath133 .",
    "for instance , in case of @xmath137 we find that @xmath138 gev . 0.3",
    "cm we can proceed analogously for other values of @xmath65 .",
    "for example , the ramond - roberts - ross textures lead to very similar results . as another exmaple",
    ", we can take the case with @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 for the other matter fields .",
    "this case leads to a degenerate @xmath0-matrix , i.e. @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "however , note that these @xmath0-parameters in general have cp phases independent of the gaugino mass unlike the case where every field has the same modular weight @xmath141 . consistently with our previous general considerations on the necessity of non - degeracy of the a matrices to have sizable cp violating contributions , in this case @xmath3 turns out to be smaller than @xmath144 .",
    "the supersymmetric contributions to the edmn include gluino , chargino and neutralino loops .. since we are considering the case with vanishing @xmath85 , the gluino contribution is dominant . for the edm of the quark @xmath145 and @xmath146 it amounts to  @xcite @xmath147 @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the gluino mass , @xmath150 is the average squark mass . the function @xmath151 is given by @xmath152 as we explained in the last section , by using the electroweak breaking condition we can write all the spectrum in terms of @xmath32 , @xmath82 , @xmath37 , and @xmath43",
    ". then the edm @xmath153 is given in terms of these parameters .",
    "we use the non - relativistic quark model approximation of the edmn : @xmath154    the mass insertion @xmath155 is given by @xmath156 in our case , we find that the @xmath157 is only one order of magnitude less than the @xmath158 . unless the phases appearing in @xmath159 are small , we would expect the imaginary part of this latter quantity to be of order @xmath160 .",
    "this implies that the gluino contribution to the edmn in this model is of order of @xmath161 .",
    "recently it has been shown that the above edmn contributions can interfere destructively with other contributions in some regions of the susy parameter space @xcite . in section 3 , we have shown that there exists a relatively large region of the the parameter space to enhance @xmath3 with non - universal @xmath0-parameters .",
    "thus , it may be possible to find some cancellation with other contributions allowing for the edmn to be suppressed to values below @xmath162 . to find such a parameter space ,",
    "a detailed analysis is needed in particular with the inclusion of the effects of @xmath85 ( we plan to provide it elsewhere  @xcite ) .",
    "other than such cancellation , as we said , the non - universal cases could include the very specially fine - tuned case where only cp phases of @xmath0-elements contributing to the edmn are suppressed .",
    "0.3 cm finally we comment on the @xmath163 cp violating parameter @xmath164 . in our case , where @xmath108 and @xmath109 give the important contributions to the cp violation processes in kaon physics , the relevant part of the effective hamiltonian @xmath165 for @xmath163 cp violation is @xmath166 where @xmath167 and @xmath168 are given in ref.@xcite and @xmath169 can be obtained from @xmath167 by exchange @xmath170 and the matrix element of the operator @xmath171 is obtained from the matrix element of @xmath168 multiplying them by @xmath172 .",
    "since we have @xmath108 approximately equal to @xmath109 , then @xmath167 is very close to @xmath169 and hence , the value of @xmath4 is very small .",
    "this cancellation between the different contributions to @xmath4 is mainly due to the symmetric nature of the trilinear and/or yukawa matrices we adopted .",
    "it has recently been shown that in the absence of such cancellation it is possible to obtain large values of @xmath173 ( compatible with the experimental results of na31 and ktev ) using the flavour changing trilinear scalar terms of the soft breaking sector  @xcite .",
    "we have studied cp violation in the susy model with the non - degenerate a - terms derived from superstring theory .",
    "this type of non - universality has a significant effect in the cp violation .",
    "we have shown the region of the parameter space where we have susy contribution for @xmath3 of order @xmath6 .",
    "0.3 cm it is interesting to investigate effects of non - universality on other cp aspects , e.g. detailed analysis of the edmn .",
    "also the effect of the non - degearcy of the a - terms is important in studying the b - physics . 0.3 cm we have considered the case where the dilaton field and only the overall moduli field contribute to susy breaking and in this case only one independent cp phase @xmath174 appears in the @xmath0-parameters",
