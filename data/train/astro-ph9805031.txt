    "in 1975 a powerful x - ray transient , , emerged in the constellation monoceros ( elvis et al .",
    "1975 ) . was the first x - ray transient to be identified with an optical brightening of a star , , at the same position ( boley &  wolfson 1975 ; boley et al .",
    "it was therefore also designated as nova mon 1975 .",
    "it is still the brightest extra - solar x - ray source seen to date , and many of the exciting results during the first months of its outburst were summarized by maran ( 1976 ) .    because of its brightness",
    "the source has been studied in considerable detail at various wavelengths .",
    "the results have appeared in a large numbers of papers in the literature .",
    "there exists , however , no thorough comparison of the optical ( ubv ) light curves together with the x - ray light curves from various experiments . either authors have presented ( part of ) the optical light curve ( with sometimes the inclusion of data points from other observers ) in one or two optical passbands and sometimes compared it with the x - ray light curve ( e.g.  robertson , warren &  bywater 1976 ; shugarov 1976 ; lloyd , noble &  penston 1977 ; ciatti , mammano &  vittone 1977 ; tsunemi , matsuoka &  takagishi 1977 ; chen , livio &  gehrels 1993 ; goranskii et al .",
    "the first rough comparison of optical and x - ray light curves was undertaken by whelan et al .",
    "( 1977 ) , together with a crude comparison with radio , infra - red and ultra - violet measurements .",
    "fortunately , almost all the optical ( plus infra - red and ultra - violet ) observations have been compiled by ron webbink in his unpublished report in 1978 . in this report he showed ( only ) the overall b band light curve , and the corresponding b@xmath0v , and u@xmath0b measurements , whenever they were simultaneous .",
    "subsequently , only a few authors have shown his b band light curve ( e.g. , chevalier &  ilovaisky 1990 ; van paradijs &  mcclintock 1995 ) .",
    "since the outburst of more ( soft ) x - ray transients ( sxts ) have been identified , some of them with considerable optical coverage ( see chen , shrader &  livio 1997 ) .",
    "we note that most of these optical observations were only in one or two passbands , and so far is still the only transient with a fairly complete optical light curve in more than 2 passbands ( largely due to its brightness ) .",
    "several of the x - ray transients have been either found to contain a black hole , including ( mcclintock &  remillard 1986 ) , or a neutron star ( e.g.  van paradijs 1998 ) .",

    "a precursor was seen .",
    "the maximum of the x - ray outburst was reached within a week after the precursor ( elvis et al .",

    "the fact that we see optical superhumps despite the luminous accretion disk has also been attributed to irradiation ( odonoghue &  charles 1996 , see also billington et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "as already noted , the first exponential decay phase of the outburst of is slower than its second exponential decay phase .",
    "this means that in the case of the secondary maximum is a temporary enhancement on the first exponential x - ray decay light curve .",
    "also in the optical the secondary ( and ` intermediate ' ) maxima decay more rapidly in order to resume the same exponential decay as seen before the secondary maximum . in the optical",
    "this occurs much earlier than in x - rays ( @xmath11 week in the optical versus @xmath12 months in x - rays ) .",
    "for the other ( short - period ) sxts with comparable outburst light curves this seems not to be the case , i.e.the decay timescales before and after the secondary maxima are similar ( see e.g.  augusteijn et al .",
    "1993 ; chen et al .  1993 ; 1997 ; see also fig .",
    "it is also evident from the overall outburst light curve of that the time difference between the main maximum and the secondary maximum and that of the secondary maximum and tertiary maximum are not of the same order , as seems to be the case for ( augusteijn et al .",
    "1993 , see also chen et al .",
    "1993 ) . however , the inferred third maximum by augusteijn et al .",
    "( 1993 ) is not the real tertiary maximum ; the tertiary maximum is probably reached @xmath1200  days after the peak of the outburst ( see kitamoto et al .",

    "are not similar ( see ebisawa et al .  1994 ; see also fig .",
    "9 ) , and its tertiary maximum is @xmath1200  days after peak of the outburst ( see ebisawa et al .  1994 ; see also tanaka &  shibazaki 1996 ) , i.e.   similar to a0620@xmath000 and gs2000 + 25 .",
    "it has recently been shown that the time of the secondary maximum in sxts is related to the viscous time scale of an irradiated disk ( shahbaz et al .",
    "1998b ; see also king &  ritter 1998 ) .",
    "the time of the tertiary maximum seems to be unrelated to this .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that the times of the expected tertiary maxima of the outbursts of , and in the model of augusteijn et al .",
    "( 1993 ) are consistent with the times of start of the spectral hardening ( see also next section ; : this paper ; : kitamoto et al .",
    "1992 ; terada et al.1998 ) ; : kitamoto et al.1992 ; ebisawa et al .",
    "moreover , the timescale between the primary and secondary maximum of the _ gro _ batse hard x - ray outburst light curve of as derived by the model of augusteijn et al .",
    "( 1993 ) is similar to the time of appearance of the first ` minioutburst ' with respect to the end of the x - ray outburst and the time between the two ` minioutbursts ' ( see callanan et al .",
    "1995 , chevalier &  ilovaisky 1995 ) .      for the first time we have demonstrated that exhibited considerable hardening @xmath1100  days after the start of the outburst . a similar hardening at nearly the same time after outburst maximum has also been seen in and ( kitamoto et al .  1992 ;",
    "ebisawa et al .  1994 ; terada et al .  1998 ) . the x - ray spectral and power spectral behaviour in and",
    "just before the hardening is consistent with canonical black - hole high - state behaviour ( and maybe also for , see section  [ a0620_intro ] ) , whereas after the hardening it is consistent with the canonical black - hole low - state behaviour ( ebisawa et al .",
    "1994 ; miyamoto et al .",
    "1994 ; terada et al .",
    "we therefore suggest that the power - spectral behaviour after the start of the spectral hardening in might have shown low - state like behaviour as well .",
    "the time of maximum x - ray spectral hardening is close to when the @xmath17.8-day modulations in the x - ray light curve of are strongest .",
    "similarly , the time of maximum x - ray spectral hardening in and also occur simultaneously with the drops in intensity , i.e.  @xmath1150  days after the start of the outburst .",
    "this suggests a connection between the x - ray spectral hardening and the occurrence of periodic modulations or drops in intensity ( see also section  [ dips ] ) .",
    "recently , a self - consistent model of accretion flows around black holes with various m has been put forward by esin , mcclintock &  narayan ( 1997 ; see also esin et al .",
    "their accretion flow consists of an adaf and an outer ( thin ) accretion disk .",
    "in addition above the orbital plane there is a hot corona .",
    "m determines the size of the adaf region and the density of the corona . in this way they could explain the different states seen in black - hole binaries , the off - state , low state , high state and ( possibly ) the very - high state",
    "the spectral hardening @xmath1150 days after the outburst is identified with the transition from the high state to low state , i.e.  the intermediate state in their model .",
    "we note that such hardening is probably not confined to black - hole sxts .",
    "it has recently been suggested that the hardening near the end of the outburst of the neutron star sxt aqlx-1 ( zhang , yu &  zhang 1998 ) after a small secondary maximum is a similar phenomenon ( shahbaz et al .",
    "if this is true , this should manifest itself in a change in the power spectral shapes , possibly resembling black - hole low - state behaviour during the hardening .      during the outburst",
    "the x - ray light curves show that various drops in intensity occurred , lasting from about one day to several days .",
    "they occurred @xmath187 , @xmath1103 , and @xmath1228  days after the start of the outburst .",
    "possibly , also the precursor may in fact represent a dip .",
    "in addition to these dips , periodic drops in intensity have been seen in x - ray and optical with a period of about 7.8  days ( see section  [ a0620_intro ] ) , and possibly also in the infra - red ( this paper ) .",
    "the occurrence of the dips are consistent with the @xmath17.8  day modulation period .",
    "it has been suggested that the @xmath17.8-day modulation is the beat period between the orbital period and the ( possible ) superhump period ( zhang &  chen 1992 ) , i.e.  the disk precession period ( see e.g.  priedhorsky &  holt 1987 ) . in the sxts where superhumps have been seen the period excess was found to be between @xmath112%   ( odonoghue &  charles 1996 ) .",
    "this has also been found for the toads ( see kuulkers , howell &  van paradijs 1996 , and references therein ) , and has been related to the extreme mass ratio in these systems .",
    "if this also holds for , the estimated superhump period would be 7.837.90hrs , which leads to a beat period between 1732  days .",
    "this is consistent with estimates of the beat period period from its relation with the orbital period and the mass ratio ( see e.g.  warner 1995 ) , i.e.  @xmath11819  days .",
    "hence the @xmath17.8-day modulation can not be related to the beat period between the orbital period and the ( possible ) superhump period .",
    "alternative models include e.g.  intrinsic oscillations of the companion star , modulating the accreted matter onto the black hole ( ciatti et al .",
    "we note that near the time of the strong @xmath17.8-day modulations the x - ray spectra harden ( see previous section ) , which suggest a connection between the two . it might be that the transition radius between the outer thin disk and inner adaf flow in the model of esin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) is oscillating around that time , i.e.  the transition radius moves inwards and outwards on a time scale of @xmath18  days , which therefore modulates the accretion rate and subsequently the amount of x - rays .",
    "another speculation might be that the heating / cooling waves oscillate inwards and outwards between certain radii , as a result of a modulation in the strength of x - ray irradiation .",
    "it remains to be seen if such mechanisms do indeed exist .",
    "moreover , the delay in optical and x - rays should also be explained in such models .",
    "the dip in x - rays @xmath187  days after the start of the outburst has not been noted before .",
    "as we have shown this corresponds to a short _ rise _ in intensity or flare at hard energies ( @xmath26kev ) , which indicates the x - ray spectrum suddenly pivots for a short time . in the optical",
    "we see that there may be a depression in the light curve , but shortly afterward the brightness increased above the expected exponential decline , which resulted in another local maximum , a so - called ` intermediate ' maximum , @xmath130  days after the secondary maximum . a similar ` intermediate '",
    "maximum may be present in the infra - red , whereas there is _ no _ indication for such a maximum in x - rays .",
    "the @xmath130  days interval between the secondary maximum and ` intermediate ' maximum is comparable to the viscous time scale in an irradiated accretion disk with parameters appropriate for a0620@xmath000 ( king &  ritter 1998 ; see also shahbaz et al .",
    "if irradiation triggers a thermal instability in the outer accretion disk , new material will accrete one viscous time scale later .",
    "this has been put forward as the explanation for the secondary maximum as an echo of the primary maximum by king &  ritter ( 1998 ; we refer to e.g.  cannizzo 1998 and references therein for other models on the cause of the secondary maximum ) .",
    "we suggest that the secondary maximum induces again enhanced irradiation which may then show up one viscous time scale later .",
    "it is not clear to us , however , why this would cause the x - ray spectrum to pivot around that time , and why it does not show up as an ` intermediate ' maximum in the x - ray light curve .",
    "the only other sxt where another local maximum has been reported which did not coincide with a local maximum in x - rays is .",
    "shrader et al .",
    "( 1994 ) reported a secondary maximum in the ultra - violet , which occurred @xmath138  days after the maximum of the _ gro _ batse outburst .",
    "however , the _ gro _ batse light curve is that for high ( @xmath220kev ) energies . for gs1124@xmath068",
    "the soft x - ray ( @xmath1110kev ) light curves differs from that in hard x - rays ( @xmath11040kev light curves ( see ebisawa et al .",
    "1994 ) , and this could also apply to .",
    "the local ultra - violet maximum might therefore have been simultaneous with a local soft x - ray maximum , which is expected to exist @xmath135  days after outburst maximum ( shahbaz et al .",
    "1998b ) .",
    "although the time of the ` hiccup ' at the end of the outburst is consistent with the minima expected in the @xmath17.8  days modulation , interestingly the time difference between the optical maximum of the tertiary peak and the ` hiccup ' is also on the order of 30  days .",
    "this may suggest a similar cause for the ` hiccup ' as that proposed for the ` intermediate ' maximum , where now the ` hiccup ' is a response to the tertiary maximum .",
    "we note that a similar ` hiccup ' might have been seen at the end of the outburst of ( chevalier &  ilovaisky 1990 ) .",
    "we have shown here that the outburst light curve of the sxt is very similar in shape to that of the toad . also the structure of the 1978 outburst light curve of ( patterson et al .  1981 )",
    "is very similar to that of ( see howell et al .",
    "1996 ) and , having a similar exponential decay , drops in magnitude near the end of the outburst and a ` bump ' at the end of the outburst .",
    "the timescales in the outbursts of and differ by a factor of @xmath15.3 .",
    "this is close to the ratio of the orbital periods of and ( @xmath184  min , see howell et al .",
    "1996 ) , i.e.  @xmath15.5 .",
    "we note that the mass ratio of is close to , i.e.  @xmath30@xmath3@xmath31 , with likely values between 0.0330.075 ( howell , hauschildt &  dhillon 1998 ) .",
    "this shows that the optical outburst light curve is not governed by the mass of the compact object , but related to the ( similar ) disk properties .",
    "interestingly , the morphology of the orbital light curve of in quiescence is rather unstable ( abbott et al .",
    "1992 ; howell et al .   1996 , and references therein ) , which has also been reported for by haswell ( 1996 ) and leibowitz , hemar &  orio ( 1998 ) .",
    "we note that the optical spectra of in quiescence have also been reported to change with time ( murdin et al .",
    "1980 ; orosz et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "masetti &  regs ( 1997 ) suggested that sxts share properties with another subclass , i.e.   the so - called stars .",
    "this was based solely on the comparison of the shape and appearance of ( super ) humps in the light curves of sxts and stars .",
    "stars are at the other extreme of the class , i.e.during quiescence they have highest mass transfer rates compared to other stars in quiescence .",
    "they therefore show very frequent outbursts with short quiescent periods , 4050  days , while their outbursts are of relatively small amplitude , @xmath32v@xmath13 ( kato &  kunjaya ( 1995 ) .",
    "these are properties clearly not shared by the sxts .",
    "the outburst and quiescence properties of sxts have been shown , however , to be very similar to those of toads , having a fast rise , large outburst amplitude , a slow outburst decay , drops in intensity near the end of the main outburst , and/or post - outburst brightenings ( kuulkers et al .",
    "our comparison between and gives additional support for their similarity .",
    "the similarities between the toads and sxts reflect that both have low mass ratios and very low mass transfer rates , m ( kuulkers et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "it is clear that these light curves represent some very generic behaviour .",
    "this may be due to a pure viscous evolution , i.e.  the outburst disk just evolves under a hot - state viscosity , without the intervention of cooling fronts , until possibly the end of the outburst .",
    "hence any mechanism that prevents the cooling front travelling in from the outer edge of the disk for a sufficiently long time will produce these light curves",
    ". in the sxts irradiation naturally provides that mechanism ( e.g.  chen et al .",
    "1993 ; van paradijs 1996 ; king 1998 ; king &  ritter 1998 ) , whose presence is suggested ( at least near maximum of the outburst ) by observations ( see e.g.  van paradijs &  mcclintock 1994 ; 1995 ; shahbaz &  kuulkers 1998)1  mag of the optical light during the first months of the outburst is due to x - ray irradiation ( see cannizzo 1998 ) . ] . for the outburst of alcom irradiation may prevent the cooling front from propagating as well , but it is more complicated in this case ( see king 1997 ) . if confirmed by more detailed modelling , it may be possible to provide a unified explanation of both cases .",
