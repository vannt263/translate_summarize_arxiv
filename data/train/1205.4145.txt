    "let @xmath21 be a system of affine linear forms such that no two forms @xmath22 and @xmath23 are affinely dependent , and suppose that @xmath24^d \\subset { \\mathbb{r}}^d$ ] is a convex body such that @xmath25 whenever @xmath11 is positive definite",
    ". then @xmath26 where the implicit constant may depend on @xmath27 and the coefficients of @xmath28 .",
    "the constants are given by @xmath29 and @xmath30 with @xmath31 denoting the local number of representations of @xmath32 by @xmath1 , that is , @xmath33    theorem [ thm : main ] provides a useful tool in the study of several diophantine problems .",

    "it is worth stressing that very little is known about the arithmetic of intersections of @xmath43 quadratics when the ambient projective dimension @xmath5 is small .",
    "a notable exception is found in work of skorobogatov @xcite who handles the question of weak approximation when @xmath44 and @xmath45 , under suitable hypotheses .",

    "in fact , it will be possible to modify the approach from @xcite , adapting only few parts .",
    "we therefore restrict attention to these changes , referring the reader to @xcite for details regarding the remaining parts",
    ".    our main tasks in establishing theorem [ thm : main ] are then to construct a pseudorandom majorant for @xmath7 when @xmath1 is indefinite , to show that a suitably @xmath46-tricked version @xmath47 of this function is gowers - uniform , and to check that the linear forms and correlation estimates are valid across the different majorants from the definite and indefinite cases .",
    "theorem [ thm : main ] can be extended to reducible forms .",
    "if @xmath1 is a form of discriminant @xmath48 , then the representation function of @xmath1 is given by @xmath49 for non - zero integers @xmath5 .",
    "if the discriminant is a square greater than @xmath48 , then the representation function is a restricted divisor function . in both cases ,",
    "the majorant function from @xcite can be employed .",
    "the @xmath46-trick is compatible with the one used for irreducible forms .",
    "the proof of the linear forms condition can be adapted without difficulties ( although this is a tedious task and will not be treated here ) .    all implicit constants in this paper are allowed to depend on the discriminants @xmath27 and the coefficients of @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath50 be a primitive indefinite form whose discriminant is not a square . in order to obtain a more explicit expression for @xmath7 than that given in the introduction",
    ", we proceed to fix a fundamental domain @xmath51 for the action of the units in the associated real quadratic field .",
    "this will allow us to write @xmath52    let @xmath53 denote the discriminant of @xmath1 and let @xmath54 be the fundamental unit of @xmath55 , that is , @xmath56 is the solution of @xmath57 for which @xmath58 is minimal under the condition @xmath59 .",
    "then , cf .",
    "@xcite , the automorph @xmath60 generates the group @xmath61 . in what follows",
    "we restrict attention to positive @xmath5 ; on replacing @xmath1 by @xmath62 , this also covers the case of representation of negative integers by @xmath1 . since",

    "all non - archimedean results that are recorded in @xcite carry over to indefinite forms directly , as is to be expected since definiteness and indefiniteness are archimedean properties . in particular , @xmath88 holds for any non - zero integer @xmath5 .",
