    "cavity optomechanics is a forefront research field in which the motional degrees of freedom of a mechanical oscillator are coupled to optical fields inside an optical cavity , stemming from the interplay through cavity resonance and radiation pressure forces  @xcite .",
    "recent progress in nano- and micro- fabrication techniques have led to impressive milestones including the cooling of a mechanical oscillator to the motional ground state  @xcite , optomechanically induced transparency  @xcite , coherent coupling of optical and mechanical modes  @xcite , entanglement between optical and mechanical resonators  @xcite , and optically induced interaction between mechanical oscillators  @xcite .",
    "cavity optomechanics has numerous applications such as precision measurement of the position of a mirror allowing for a gravitational wave detection  @xcite , a realization of macroscopic quantum objects  @xcite , and as a fundamental platform for exploring coupling to other quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "to date almost all experiments and treatments of cavity optomechanics are based on linearized optomechanical interactions in the sense that the interaction is linear in both the field and mechanical variables , and are therefore based on single photon - phonon interactions  @xcite . the intrinsic optomechanical interaction is , however , nonlinear , which comes to the fore in the single - photon strong coupling regime .",
    "the nonlinear nature of the optomechanical interaction gives rise to a variety of features previously explored in nonlinear quantum optics  @xcite , including photon blockade effects  @xcite , the generation of non - gaussian states  @xcite , and nonclassical antibunched mechanical resonators  @xcite .",
    "since the single - photon radiation pressure is too small to realize the nonlinear strong coupling regime in nanofabricated optomechanical systems , several proposals have studied the possibility of an enhanced optomechanical nonlinearity  @xcite , and thus sub - poissonian phonon field , based on an optomechanical system employing two optical modes in the weak coupling regime  @xcite .    in this paper , we theoretically analyze an approach for producing an antibunched phonon field based on the membrane - in - the - middle geometry , and in the weak coupling regime  @xcite . in particular , a single - mode mechanical oscillator is quadratically coupled to a single - mode cavity field in the regime where the cavity damping is a dominant source of dissipation , resulting in an effective cubic nonlinearity after adiabatic elimination of the cavity field .",
    "we show that the mechanical oscillator is coupled to an effective optical reservoir at zero temperature in addition to its own mechanical heat bath at finite temperature . to avoid the difficulties that arise from the multiplicative noise that appears from the use of the heisenberg - langevin equations , we here employ the schrdinger picture .",
    "then we demonstrate analytically that the mechanics displays a chaotic phonon field with small multiphoton optomechanical cooperativity , whereas an antibunched single - phonon appears for large multiphoton cooperativity .",
    "this remainder of this paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "[ sec : model system ] describes the model system , and sec .",
    "[ sec : density operator formalism ] derives the relevant master equation for the mechanical system . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we employ the complex @xmath0 representation to investigate the steady - state behaviors of the mechanical oscillator for both the high and low temperature regimes , and the appearance of antibunching .",
    "finally sec.[conclusions ] gives our summary and conclusions .",
    "we consider a membrane - in - the - middle optomechanical system in which the single - mode of an optical resonator is quadratically - coupled to a single mechanical mode of effective mass @xmath1 and frequency @xmath2 .",
    "the net hamiltonian governing the optomechanical system is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the hamiltonian for the single - mode optical field driven by a monochromatic field of frequency @xmath5 at pumping rate @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the hamiltonian for the free mechanical mode .",
    "the optomechanical interaction is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the quadratic single - photon optomechanical coupling coefficient , that we choose as positive to avoid any issues of mechanical instability @xcite .",
    "finally , @xmath10 describes the interaction of the cavity field and mechanical modes with their associated reservoirs and accounts for dissipation .",
    "the heisenberg - langevin equations of motion for our problem can involve multiplicative quantum noise in the presence of nonlinear interactions  @xcite . to circumvent these problems",
    "we here explore the dynamics of the optomechanical system in the schrdinger picture since the equation of motion describing the optomechanical system is then strictly linear in the density operator .",
    "the dynamics of the optomechanical system under the influence of thermal fluctuations in the quantum regime can then be described by the master equation  @xcite @xmath11+\\frac{\\kappa}{2}{\\cal d}[\\hat a]\\tilde\\rho \\nonumber \\\\   & & + \\frac{\\gamma}{2}{\\bar n}_{\\rm th}{\\cal d}[\\hat b^\\dag]\\tilde\\rho+\\frac{\\gamma}{2}({\\bar n}_{\\rm th}+1){\\cal d}[\\hat b]\\tilde\\rho , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the density operator for the combined optomechanical system , and the dissipation terms @xmath13\\tilde\\rho$ ] are of the standard lindblad form @xmath14\\tilde\\rho = ( 2\\hat o \\tilde\\rho \\hat o^{\\dag}-\\hat o^\\dag \\hat o \\tilde \\rho- \\tilde\\rho\\hat o^\\dag \\hat o).\\ ] ] these account for damping of the cavity field with decay rate @xmath15 due to the coupling to a zero - temperature optical reservoir , and damping of the mechanical oscillator with decay rate @xmath16 due to interaction with a mechanical reservoir at temperature @xmath17 . the thermal occupation number of the mechanical bath is denoted by @xmath18^{-1}$ ] .      to proceed it is convenient to introduce the unitary operator @xmath19 that transforms to a frame rotating at the driving frequency @xmath20 for the cavity field @xmath21 and the unitary displacement operator @xmath22 capturing the steady - state mean amplitude of the cavity field resulting from the external pump @xmath23 with steady - state intracavity amplitude @xmath24 given by @xmath25 without loss of generality @xmath24 is here chosen as real by judicious choice of the phase of the pumping rate @xmath6 , and @xmath26 is the detuning of the pump laser from the resonance .",
    "the master equation for the transformed density operator @xmath27 then becomes @xmath28-i\\omega_m^\\prime[\\hat b^\\dag\\hat b , \\bar \\rho]-ig_0n_c[\\hat b^{\\dag 2}+\\hat b^2 , \\bar \\rho ] \\nonumber \\\\   & & -ig[(\\hat a+\\hat a^\\dag)(\\hat b^{\\dag}+\\hat b)^2 , \\bar \\rho ] -ig_0[\\hat a^\\dag\\hat a(\\hat b^{\\dag}+\\hat b)^2 , \\bar \\rho ] \\nonumber \\\\   & & + \\frac{\\kappa}{2}{\\cal d}[\\hat a]\\bar\\rho + \\frac{\\gamma}{2}{\\bar n}_{\\rm th}{\\cal d}[\\hat b^\\dag]\\bar\\rho+\\frac{\\gamma}{2}({\\bar n}_{\\rm th}+1){\\cal d}[\\hat b]\\bar\\rho , \\label{master_temp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the shifted frequency of the mechanical oscillator , and @xmath30 .",
    "this frequency shift proportional to the intracavity photon number comes from the quadratic optomechanical interaction , as opposed to the displacement of the mechanical equilibrium position that rises for the case of linear optomechanical coupling .    in the regime",
    "in which the mean cavity photon number @xmath31 is much larger than the photon fluctuations , the fifth term on the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ master_temp ] ) may be neglected : this term is a factor @xmath32 smaller than the third term and a factor @xmath33 smaller than the fourth term , these also arising from the quadratic interaction . following this approximation leads to an optomechanical interaction that is linear in the cavity field operators .    in order to investigate the mechanics in the deep quantum regime ,",
    "we proceed by assuming that the external pump is red - detuned by twice the effective mechanical frequency , @xmath34",
    ". then a further simplification follows by invoking the rotating - wave approximation in the interaction picture implemented by the unitary transformation @xmath35 , and the resulting master equation becomes @xmath36 \\nonumber \\\\   & & + \\frac{\\kappa}{2}{\\cal d}[\\hat a]\\rho + \\frac{\\gamma}{2}{\\bar n}_{\\rm th}{\\cal d}[\\hat b^\\dag]\\rho+\\frac{\\gamma}{2}({\\bar n}_{\\rm th}+1){\\cal d}[\\hat",

    "we note that the third term on the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ master_temp ] ) has been neglected on the basis that it is off - resonant and counter - rotating if @xmath38 , and we have checked numerically that this term is indeed negligible in the weak coupling regime .",
    "physically the hamiltonian representing the schrdinger evolution in eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) reads @xmath39 and is identical to the interaction picture hamiltonian describing a parametric amplifier in quantum optics and is well - known to generate two photons in the subharmonic mode ( @xmath40 ) destroying a photon in the pump mode ( @xmath41 )  @xcite .",
    "it is thus expected that two phonons of the mechanics can be destroyed by creating a single photon which is eventually leaked out the optical resonator by the cavity field dissipation at rate @xmath15 .      in the regime where cavity dissipation is the dominant source of damping",
    ", the state of the cavity field tends to approach to a coherent state in a timescale of @xmath42 and thus the density operator describing the optomechanical system can be approximated as a product state @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the reduced density operator for the cavity field and @xmath45 is the reduced density operator for the mechanics .",
    "one should keep in mind that on a timescale slower than @xmath42 , the dynamics of the optomechanical system is dependent of that of the mechanical oscillator whereas the dynamics of the cavity field is instantaneously followed by that of the mechanics due to the fast dissipation of the cavity field .",
    "specifically , the reduced density operator for the cavity field describes the vacuum state , @xmath46 in that we are already in the displaced field picture .    in order to properly eliminate the reduced density operator for the cavity field and to derive the effective master equation for the mechanical oscillator",
    ", we follow the approach used for eliminating the density operator for the pump mode of a parametric amplifier in quantum optics or for the cavity field in cavity qed , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the reduced density operator for the mechanics is then described by the effective master equation @xmath47\\rho_m \\nonumber\\\\   & & + \\frac{\\gamma}{2}{\\bar n}_{\\rm th}{\\cal d}[\\hat b^\\dag]\\rho_m + \\frac{\\gamma}{2}({\\bar n}_{\\rm th}+1){\\cal d}[\\hat b]\\rho_m,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the nonlinear optomechanical damping rate given by @xmath49 note that this rate is identical to the maximum value of the optomechanical damping rate for @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "the first term on the right - hand - side of the effective master equation accounts for two - phonon damping of the mechanical oscillator and the damping rate is proportional to the cavity photon number , indicating that the mechanical oscillator experiences the optical reservoir at zero temperature through the cavity field .",
    "in other words , the intracavity photon number can be used as a control parameter for the nonlinear optomechanical coupling strength of the mechanics to optical reservoir .",
    "that is , the dynamics and steady - state properties of mechanical oscillator are affected by two independent heat baths : the optical bath at zero temperature via two phonon processes and mechanical bath at finite temperature via one phonon processes .",
    "it is convenient to scale time to the inverse of the mechanical decay rate , @xmath51 , in terms of which the effective master equation for the mechanics then becomes @xmath52\\rho_m \\nonumber \\\\   & & + \\frac{1}{2}{\\bar n}_{\\rm th}{\\cal d}[\\hat b^\\dag]\\rho_m + \\frac{1}{2}({\\bar n}_{\\rm th}+1){\\cal d}[\\hat b]\\rho_m,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the multiphoton cooperativity @xmath53 is given by @xmath54 the multiphoton cooperativity is dimensionless and is a measure of the relative coupling strengths of the mechanical oscillator to the cavity - filtered optical bath and mechanical heat bath .",
    "large cooperativity compared to the thermal occupation number @xmath55 indicates that mechanical oscillator is more influenced by the optical bath than the mechanical bath and the dynamics of the mechanics is highly nonlinear .",
    "we next turn to the analytic solution of the master equation for the mechanics in the high and low temperature regimes . for this purpose",
    "we employ well known phase - space methods that we now discuss briefly as applied to our case .",
    "as is well - known , a nonlinear quantum mechanical problem can be mapped into a classical stochastic process by an appropriate phase space representation .",
    "we proceed to derive the equation of motion for the mechanical system in the complex @xmath0 representation .",

    "( [ fp_equation ] ) is identical to that of the complex @xmath0 distriubution for single - mode optical field in a cavity that involves cubic - nonlinear dispersive medium  @xcite .",
    "we further note that there are two diffusion sources for the complex @xmath0 distribution function , thermal fluctuations due to mechanical heat bath represented by the off - diagonal elements of the diffusion matrix , and additional quantum fluctuations due to the optomechanical interaction represented by the diagonal elements .",
    "given the steady - state complex distribution function @xmath64 all normally - ordered steady - state moments can be calculated as @xmath65      in the regime where the thermal fluctuations are the dominant source of diffusion , @xmath66 , we are able to neglect quantum fluctuations resulting from the optomechanical interaction so that the diffusion matrix can be approximated as @xmath67 then setting the left - hand - side of eq .",
