    "we must remember that the standard model of particle physics is a remarkably successful physical theory . it has been tested in literally thousands of different and diverse ways .",
    "some of its predictions ( for example the anomalous electron magnetic moment ) have been verified to one part in @xmath0 , whereas some of them ( particularly the ones involving low energies and the strong interactions ) have only been tested at the 10@xmath1 level . however , there is to date no unambiguous direct collider measurement which rules it out .",
    "the more precise predictions are sensitive to higher loops of standard model particles ( and in principle could be affected by loops involving beyond the standard model particles ) .",
    "going beyond the standard model successfully then should not upset any of these successful predictions , and so any extension is likely to only be a small perturbation , at least at the energy scales currently being probed . let us now turn to the fundamentals that the standard model is built upon .",
    "microscopically we have _ quantum mechanics _ and _ special relativity _ as two fundamental theories . a consistent framework incorporating these two theories",
    "is _ quantum field theory ( qft)_. in this theory the fundamental entities are quantum fields .",
    "their excitations correspond to the physically observable elementary particles which are the basic constituents of matter as well as the mediators of all the known interactions .",
    "therefore , fields have a particle - like character .",
    "particles can be classified in two general classes : bosons ( spin @xmath2 ) and fermions ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "bosons and fermions have very different physical behaviour .",
    "the main difference is that fermions can be shown to satisfy the pauli `` exclusion principle '' , which states that two identical fermions can not occupy the same quantum state , and therefore explaining the vast diversity of atoms .",
    "all apparently elementary matter particles are fermions , for example the leptons ( including electrons and neutrinos ) and quarks ( that make protons , neutrons and all other hadrons ) .",
    "bosons on the other hand include the photon ( particle of light and mediator of electromagnetic interaction ) , and the mediators of all the other interactions .",
    "they are not constrained by the pauli principle .",
    "as we shall see , _ supersymmetry _ is a symmetry that unifies bosons and fermions despite all their differences .",
    "if qft is the basic framework to study elementary processes , one tool to learn about these processes is the concept of _",
    "symmetry_.    a symmetry is a transformation that can be made to a physical system leaving the physical observables unchanged . throughout",
    "the history of science symmetry has played a very important role in better understanding nature .      for elementary particles , we can define two general classes of symmetries :    * _ space - time symmetries : _ these symmetries correspond to transformations on a field theory acting explicitly on the space - time coordinates , @xmath4 some examples are rotations , translations and , more generally , _ lorentz- and poincar transformations _ defining special relativity as well as _",
    "general coordinate transformations _ that define _ general relativity_. * _ internal symmetries : _ these are symmetries that correspond to transformations of the different fields in a field theory , @xmath5 roman indices @xmath6 label the corresponding fields .",
    "if @xmath7 is constant then the symmetry is a _ global symmetry _",
    "; in case of space - time dependent @xmath8 the symmetry is called a _ local symmetry _ or a _",
    "gauge symmetry_.      symmetry is important for various reasons :    _ labelling and classifying particles : _ symmetries label and classify particles according to the different conserved quantum numbers identified by the space - time and internal symmetries ( mass , spin , charge , colour , etc . ) . in this regard",
    "symmetries actually `` define '' an elementary particle according to the behaviour of the corresponding field with respect to the different symmetries .",
    "symmetries determine the _ interactions _ among particles , by means of the _ gauge principle _",
    ", for instance .",
    "it is important that _ most qfts of vector bosons are sick : they are non - renormalisable in a way that makes them unpredictive_. the counter example to this is _ gauge _ theory , where vector bosons are _ necessarily in the adjoint representation _ of the gauge group .    as an illustration , consider the lagrangian @xmath9 which is invariant under rotations in the complex plane @xmath10 as long as @xmath11 is a constant ( this corresponds to a global symmetry ) .",
    "if @xmath12 , the kinetic term is no longer invariant : @xmath13 however , the covariant derivative @xmath14 , defined as @xmath15 transforms like @xmath16 itself , if the gauge - potential @xmath17 transforms to @xmath18 : @xmath19 so we rewrite the lagrangian to ensure gauge invariance : @xmath20 the scalar field @xmath16 couples to the gauge field @xmath17 via @xmath21 , similarly , the dirac lagrangian @xmath22 contains an interaction term @xmath23 .",
    "this interaction provides the three point vertex that describes interactions of electrons and photons , illustrating how photons mediate the electromagnetic interactions .",
    "symmetries can hide or be _ spontaneously broken : _ consider the potential @xmath24 in the scalar field lagrangian above .     with @xmath25 . from ref .",
    "@xcite.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    if @xmath26 , then it is symmetric for @xmath27 .",
    "if the potential is of the type @xmath28 then the minimum is at @xmath29 ( here @xmath30 denotes the _ vacuum expectation value ( vev ) _ of the field @xmath16 ) .",
    "the vacuum state is then also symmetric under the symmetry since the origin is invariant .",
    "however if the potential is of the form @xmath31 the symmetry of @xmath32 is lost in the ground state @xmath33 .",
    "the existence of hidden symmetries is important for at least two reasons :    * this is a natural way to introduce an energy scale in the system , determined by the non vanishing vev . in particular , in the standard model , the electroweak scale @xmath34 gev defines the basic scale of mass for the particles of the standard model , the electroweak gauge bosons and the matter fields , through their yukawa couplings , obtain their mass from the vev . *",
    "the existence of hidden symmetries implies that the fundamental symmetries of nature may be larger than is apparent .",
    "this is because the only manifest symmetries we can observe are the symmetries of the vacuum we live in and not those of the full underlying theory .",
    "this opens - up an essentially unlimited resource to consider physical theories with an indefinite number of symmetries even though they are not explicitly realized in nature .",
    "the standard model is one typical example and supersymmetry and theories of extra dimensions are further examples .",
    "the standard model is well defined and currently well confirmed by experiments .",
    "it is based on the two classes of symmetry :    * _ space - time symmetry _ : poincar symmetry in 4 dimensions . *",
    "_ internal symmetry _ : gauged @xmath35=su(3)@xmath36su(2)@xmath37u(1)@xmath38 symmetry , where su(3)@xmath39 defines the strong interactions .",
    "su(2)@xmath40u(1)@xmath38 is spontaneously broken by the _",
    "mechanism to u(1)@xmath41 .",
    "the gauge fields are spin-1 bosons , for example the photon @xmath42 , or gluons @xmath43 .",
    "matter fields ( quarks and leptons ) have spin 1/2@xmath44 and come in three ` families ' ( successively heavier copies ) .",
    "the higgs boson ( a particle has been discovered at the lhc whose properties are consistent with the standard model higgs boson ) is the spin zero particle that spontaneously breaks the su(2)@xmath40u(1)@xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath45 and @xmath46 bosons get a mass via the higgs mechanism and therefore the weak interactions are short range .",
    "this is also the source of masses for all quarks and leptons .",
    "the sub - index @xmath47 in @xmath48 refers to the fact that the standard model does not preserve parity and differentiates between left - handed and right - handed particles . in the standard model only left - handed particles transform",
    "non - trivially under @xmath48 .",
    "the gauge particles have all spin @xmath49 and mediate each of the three forces : photons ( @xmath50 ) for @xmath51 electromagnetism , gluons for @xmath52 of strong interactions , and the massive @xmath45 and @xmath46 bosons for the weak interactions .",
    "the standard model is one of the cornerstones of all science and one of the great triumphs of the past century .",
    "it has been carefully experimentally verified in many ways , especially during the past 20 years",
    ". however , there are still some unresolved issues or mysteries :    * the hierarchy problem .",
    "the higgs mass is @xmath53 gev , whereas the gravitational scale is @xmath54 gev .",
    "the ` hierarchy problem ' is : why is @xmath55 so much smaller than 1 ? in a fundamental theory , one might expect them to be the same order . in qft , one sees that quantum corrections ( loops ) to @xmath56 are expected to be of order of the heaviest scale in the theory divided by @xmath57 .",
    "the question of why the hierarchy is stable with respect to the quantum corrections is called the _ technical hierarchy problem _ , and is arguably the main motivation for weak - scale supersymmetry . *",
    "the cosmological constant ( @xmath58 ) problem : probably the biggest unsolved problem in fundamental physics .",
    "@xmath58 is the energy density of free space time .",
    "the cosmological constant problem is : why is @xmath59 ? * the standard model has around 20 parameters , which must be measured then set ` by hand ' .",
    "many consider that a more satisfying fundamental theory would relate all of these parameters to less ( or ideally one ) fundamental parameter . *",
    "what particle constitutes the inferred cold dark matter in the universe ?",
    "it is not contained in the standard model .",
    "planck and large scale structure data favour a cosmological constant - cold dark matter model , where approximately 22@xmath1 of the universe s energy budget lies in dark matter , only 4@xmath1 in ordinary matter , and some 74@xmath1 in mysterious dark energy . ]",
    "neutrinos constitute a hot component of dark matter ( since they are relativistic when they decouple from the thermal plasma i.e.they smooth density perturbations in the early universe on smaller scales ) , so they are not good candidates . +   ( i.e.  time increasing toward the right ) , this describes _ annihilation _ :",
    "once the particle physics model is set , a calculation tells us how much is thermally produced in the early universe .",
    "this also is a diagram for dark matter indirect detection , for example by dark matter collecting in the core of the sun and annihilating into neutrinos which could be detected by the icecube experiment . for @xmath60 ,",
    "the diagram depicts _ collider production _ at ( e.g. ) the lhc , whereas for @xmath61 , it s _ direct detection _ , where dark matter colliding with heavy nuclei may produce measurable nuclear recoils",
    ". [ fig : dm ] ] * the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon : this is a particular interaction between the photon and the muon : the dirac equation predicts a muon magnetic moment @xmath62 and at tree level , @xmath63 .",
    "however , it can be measured very precisely by storing muons in a ring with magnetic fields , then measuring the _ precession frequency _ of their spins .",
    "the ` anomalous ' part comes from loops involving various particles . defining @xmath64  @xcite , + some sm contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon . from ref .",
    "+ @xmath65 + where the first number in brackets labels the statistical error and the second the systematic error .",
    "the measurement of @xmath66 thus differs with the sm prediction at around the @xmath67 level ( and has done for some 20 years ) .",
    "there should be a new more accurate measurement from the muon @xmath68 experiment at the fermilab collider in 2017 .",
    "if one adds new particles to the sm , it is possible that they could travel in loops in diagrams similar to those in fig .",
    "[ fig : g-2 ] , and introduce a non - standard contribution to explain the discrepancy between the sm prediction and the sm measurement .",
    "we wish to find extensions that could solve some or all of the problems mentioned above in order to generalize the standard model .",
    "experiments are a traditional way of making progress in science .",
    "we need experiments to explore energies above the currently attainable scales and discover new particles and underlying principles that generalize the standard model .",
    "this approach is of course being followed at the lhc .",
    "the lhc will explore physics at the tev scale , an interesting and important rgime for new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "notice that directly exploring energies closer to the planck scale @xmath69 gev is out of the reach for many years to come .",
    "the planck mass @xmath70 gev is an energy scale associated with gravity and the electroweak scale @xmath71 gev is an energy scale associated with the electroweak symmetry breaking scale of the standard model .",
    "the hierarchy problem involves these two scales being so different in magnitude .",
    "actually the problem can be formulated in two parts :    * why is @xmath72 at tree level ?",
    "this question is known as ` the hierarchy problem ' .",
    "there are many solutions , once the sm is extended .",
    "* once we have solved ( i ) , we ask why is the hierarchy stable under quantum corrections ?",
    "this is the ` technical hierarchy problem ' and does not have many full / effective solutions , aside from supersymmetry ( susy ) .",
    "let us now think some more about the technical hierarchy problem . in the standard model we know that :    * vector bosons are massless due to gauge invariance , that means , a direct mass term for the gauge particles @xmath73 is not allowed by gauge invariance ( @xmath74 for a @xmath51 field , for example ) .",
    "* chiral fermion masses @xmath75 are also forbidden for all quarks and leptons by gauge invariance ( because , for example , @xmath76 and @xmath77 have different hypercharges ) .",
    "recall that these particles receive a mass only through the yukawa couplings to the higgs ( e.g. @xmath78 giving a dirac mass to @xmath79 after @xmath80 gets a non - zero valueparity conservation ( see below ) , the minimal supersymmetric standard model does not give neutrinos mass .",
    "thus one must augment the model in some way : one can do this by adding right - handed neutrinos to the model . ] ) . *",
    "the higgs boson is the only fundamental scalar particle in the standard model .",
    "there is no symmetry banning its mass term @xmath81 in the standard model lagrangian .",
    "if the heaviest state in the theory has a mass squared of @xmath82 , loops give corrections of order @xmath83 to the scalar mass squared .",
    "the corrections come from both bosons and fermions running in loops , for example : @xmath84{mh } } \\end{picture } \\sim { -   \\frac{a\\lambda^2}{16 \\pi^2 } \\int \\frac{d^n k } { k^2 - m_f^2 } + \\ldots } , \\ ] ] where @xmath85 is some dimensionless @xmath86 constant .",
    "the quantum correction to the higgs mass from this diagram are : @xmath87 experimentally , the higgs mass is measured to be @xmath53 gev . the standard model is considered to be unnatural since the loop corrections are typically much larger : the largest are expected to be @xmath88 gev",
    ". therefore even if we start with a tree - level higgs mass of order the electroweak scale , loop corrections would bring it up to almost the highest scale in the theory : @xmath89 , since we expect @xmath90 .",
    "this would ruin the hierarchy between large and small scales .",
    "it is possible to adjust or `` fine tune '' the loop corrections such as to keep the higgs light , but this would require cancellations between the apparently unrelated tree - level and loop contributions to some 15 significant figures .",
    "this fine tuning is considered unnatural and an explanation of why the higgs mass ( and the whole electroweak scale ) can be naturally maintained to be hierarchically smaller than the planck scale or any other large cutoff scale @xmath58 is required .      in order to go beyond the standard model we can follow several avenues , for example :    * add new particles and/or interactions ( e.g.  a dark matter particle ) . *",
    "more symmetries .",
    "for example , * internal symmetries , for example _ grand unified theories ( guts ) _ in which the symmetries of the standard model are themselves the result of the breaking of a yet larger symmetry group : @xmath91 + let s take one of the simplest examples , @xmath92 : @xmath93 ( the @xmath94 is an anti - symmetric matrix ; we have omitted the lower left - hand half of it because the entries are simply related to those above the diagonal ) .",
    "thus , we see how quarks and leptons become unified within multiplets of @xmath95 .",
    "+   gauge unification does nt work in the standard model : the three gauge couplings @xmath96 should all unify at a single renormalisation scale @xmath97 .",
    "one needs to add some additional particles of mass below @xmath98 gev in order to make this work .",
    "experiments ( lep and lhc experiments , for example ) fix the gauge couplings at the left - hand side of the figure , and renormalisation within qft is used to evolve them to the right . from ref .",
    "+ the gut proposal is very elegant because it unifies , in one single symmetry , the three gauge interactions of the standard model .",
    "it leaves unanswered most of the open questions above , except for the fact that it reduces the number of independent parameters due to the fact that there is only one gauge coupling at large energies .",
    "this is expected to `` run '' at low energies and give rise to the three different couplings of the standard model ( one corresponding to each group factor ) .",
    "unfortunately , with our present precision understanding of the gauge couplings and spectrum of the standard model , the running of the three gauge couplings does * not * unify at a single coupling at higher energies but they cross each other at different energies : see fig .  [ fig : gaugeunsm ] . because leptons and quarks are unified within gut multiplets , they predict e.g.   @xmath99 , which also does nt work , and in practice further model building is required .",
    "+ guts have heavy @xmath100 and @xmath101 gauge boson particles of order the gauge unification scale , which arize from a gut higgs mechanism ( in a completely analogous way to the way in which the @xmath102 and @xmath46 bosons acquire their mass).they predict _ proton decay _ , which is nt observed at super - kamiokande .",
    "the current constraint from super - kamiokande is that the proton lifetime @xmath103 years .",
    "+   example @xmath104 process from guts . from ref .",
    "+ however , estimating @xmath105 gev from fig .",
    "[ fig : gaugeunsm ] , we predict , for ordinary guts , a proton lifetime of @xmath106 which easily is in contravention of the super kamiokande bound . * _",
    "supersymmetry_. for a phenomenological review of supserymmetry , see ref .",
    "supersymmetry is an external , or space - time , symmetry .",
    "supersymmetry solves the technical hierarchy problem due to cancellations between the contributions of bosons and fermions to the electroweak scale , defined by the higgs mass .",
    "combined with the gut idea , it also solves the unification of the three gauge couplings at one single point at larger energies .",
    "supersymmetry also provides the most studied example for dark matter candidates .",
    "moreover , it provides well defined qfts in which the rgime of strong coupling can be better studied than in non - supersymmetric models . * extra spatial dimensions .",
    "more general space - time symmetries open up many more interesting avenues for investigation .",
    "these can be of two types .",
    "first we can add more dimensions to space - time , extending the poincar symmetries of the standard model and the general coordinate transformations of general relativity .",
    "this is the well known _",
    "kaluza klein theory _ in which our observation of a 4 dimensional universe is only due to the fact that we have limitations about `` seeing '' other dimensions of space - time that may be hidden to our observations . in recent years this has been extended to the _ brane world scenario _ in which our 4 dimensional universe is only a brane or surface inside a higher dimensional universe .",
    "these ideas lead to a different perspective on the hierarchy problem and also may help unify internal and space - time symmetries . * beyond qft : a qft with supersymmetry and extra dimensions does not address the problem of quantising gravity . for this purpose ,",
    "the current best hope is string theory which goes beyond the basic framework of qft .",
    "it so happens that for its consistency , string theory requires supersymmetry and extra dimensions .",

    "* ramond , neveu - schwarz , gervais , sakita ( 1971 ) derived supersymmetry in 2 dimensions ( from string theory ) .",
    "* wess and zumino ( 1974 ) wrote down supersymmetric field theories in 4 dimensions .",
    "they opened the way for many other contributions to the field .",
    "this is often seen as the actual starting point for the systematic study of supersymmetry . *",
    "haag , lopuszanski , sohnius ( 1975 ) : generalized the coleman mandula theorem to show that the only non - trivial quantum field theories have a symmetry group of super poincar group in a direct product with internal symmetries .",
    "the poincar algebra consists of commutation relations between 4-momentum operators @xmath113 ( generating translations in space and time ) and @xmath114 , generating lorentz boosts and rotations . particles of the standard model are all irreducible representations of the pointcar group .    to implement supersymmetry , we _",
    "extend _ the poincar algebra non - trivially .",
    "the _ coleman mandula theorem _ stated that in 3@xmath1151 dimensions , one can not do this in a non - trivial way and still have non - zero scattering amplitudes . in other words , there is no non - trivial mix of poincar and internal symmetries with non - zero scattering except for the direct product    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ poincar @xmath110 internal . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    however ( as usual with no - go theorems ) there was a loop - hole because of an implicit axiom : the proof only considered `` _ bosonic _ generators '' .",

    "i personally and perhaps naively expect some signal to show up in the first 100 fb@xmath291 of run ii data .",

    "meson decays that form the variable @xmath393 . ]    on the other hand , there are several interesting excesses in @xmath146 physics measurements as compared to sm measurements , which we have not explicitly discussed in these beyond the standard model lectures .",
    "probably the theoretically cleanest of these is that of @xmath394 from the lhcb experiment  @xcite .",
    "large theoretical uncertainties associated with mesonic physics cancel well in such a ratio , particularly when one is probing final states involving leptons . in the sm , @xmath395 is a firm prediction from diagrams like fig .",
