    ". however , an efficient way to identify the bulk population of @xmath27 massive galaxies is still lacking .",
    "one of the most efficient ways of selecting massive galaxies is color selection , a method that relies on the strong spectral breaks prevalent in massive galaxies .",
    "this technique allows a rather clean selection of galaxies at certain redshifts and enables fair comparisons between different studies .",
    "a number of color - selection methods have been proposed to select @xmath4 galaxies , making use of either the balmer break @xcite or the 1.6  @xmath32 m stellar bump @xcite as redshift indicators .",
    "one concern of these selection methods is contamination from dusty galaxies and agns at lower redshifts ( @xmath33 ) : extremely dusty galaxies or agns at lower redshifts present similarly red colors ( due to attenuation or intrinsic red seds ) which mimic those of the massive galaxies at high redshift ( due to balmer or the 1.6  @xmath32 m break ) .",
    "this is similar to what we have learned from color - selection techniques at @xmath34 , e.g. , distant red galaxies @xcite , irac - selected extremely red objects @xcite , and @xmath35 and irac - selected extremely red objects  ( wang et al . 2012 ) .",
    "how to separate true high - redshift ( @xmath27 ) from these low - redshift contaminants remains a challenge for color - selection techniques . in practice , to recover the bulk populations with color - selection techniques , we need a large range of nir to mid - infrared ( mir ) colors .",

    "although photometric redshifts are believed to be more reliable in deep fields , e.g. , in the hudf and goods fields , massive galaxies are rare , and larger fields are needed to obtain statistically significant results . in this case ,",
    "color selection that requires only a few bands with high - quality photometry has the advantage of efficiently identifying large samples of certain populations of galaxies .",
    "most existing studies are based on near - infrared - selected samples , mostly @xmath1 band , which probes the rest - frame uv .",
    "as a consequence , they may miss some of the most massive and/or dustiest galaxies , as illustrated by @xcite ( see also ,",

    "these are believed to be massive and dusty galaxies at high redshift .",
    "determining the number density and star formation properties of these galaxies is essential to obtain a complete view of both galaxy stellar mass functions and cosmic star formation rate densities at high redshifts .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the general faintness of hieros in the uv suggests that most of their star formation is hidden by dust .",
    "the amount of this hidden star formation can be inferred through infrared emission , which originates from the thermal reradiation by dust of their absorbed ultraviolet light .",
    "therefore , understanding the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) in the infrared is essential to get a complete view of star formation in hieros .",
    "alternatively , we could use dust - unbiased tracers of star formation , e.g. , radio continuum , to measure the total star formation rate .",
    "however , although both the far - infrared and radio surveys in the goods fields are among the deepest ever conducted , only a few hieros are individually detected .",
    "moreover , most of the detected ones are @xmath7 hieros . for instance , crossmatching with the vla 1.4  ghz catalog in goods - north @xcite , 33 out of 142 hieros are detected at 1.4  ghz with @xmath41  ujy , but only 6 out of 33 are classified as @xmath5 hieros .",
    "this is likely caused by the high redshifts of the @xmath5 hiero population and that most of them are not extreme starbursts ( contrary to bright submillimeter galaxies ) . to probe lower star formation rates that are typical of hieros , a stacking approach is required .",
    "for the @xmath5 hiero population , we excluded contaminants at low redshifts by applying a redshift cut of @xmath4 , which leaves us 66 galaxies . for the @xmath7 hiero population ,",

    "we retrieved flux densities by psf - fitting the stacked images .",
    "a correction factor ranging from 0.92 at 250 @xmath43 to 0.75 at 500  @xmath43 was applied to account for clustering , which does not change much with redshift and stellar mass of the galaxies  @xcite .",

    "significant detections are found at all wavelengths while there are no detections with @xmath44 in any infrared bands for @xmath7 qs hieros .",
    "this provides independent evidence that our approach successfully separates the qs and sf populations .",

    "this method avoids the drawback that the uncertainties in different bands as derived from bootstrapping galaxies in a single band are likely correlated , e.g. , galaxies that are fainter in the shorter wavelength may tend to be brighter in the larger wavelength due to the variations in dust temperature and/or redshifts .      a tight correlation between @xmath52 and uv continuum slope @xmath53 exists for uv - selected l@xmath54 star - forming galaxies in the local universe and up to @xmath55  @xcite . at higher redshifts",

    "the ssfr for @xmath5 hieros , 4.2  gyr@xmath13 , is twice as high as that for similarly massive galaxies at @xmath71  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the ssfr of massive galaxies continues to increase at @xmath72 and up to @xmath73 .",
    "however , the growth rate at @xmath74 is slower than that at @xmath752 .",
    "for instance , @xcite found that the evolution of ssfr at @xmath76 roughly follows @xmath77 , which predicts ssfr @xmath78  gyr@xmath13 , much higher than we observed here at @xmath23 .",
    "based on simple analytic arguments on the accretion rates into halos and the accretion of baryons into galaxies , @xcite showed the evolution of ssfr for typical galaxies should follow @xmath79 , which also predicts a higher ssfr at @xmath23 than observed for hieros .",

    "it is suggested that the formation of these galaxies must have been through a compact star - forming phase  @xcite .",

    "these are likely to form the bulk population of compact quiescent galaxies at @xmath87 . however ,",
    "when and how these compact galaxies formed remains unclear .",
    "moreover , a significant number of passive galaxies have already formed at @xmath204 @xcite , as also shown in this work , and the star - forming progenitors of these earliest quenched systems remain elusive @xcite .",
    "studying structural properties of @xmath5 hieros , which are representative massive galaxies at @xmath4 , should provide us important insights into these questions .    for both the @xmath5 and the @xmath7 qs hiero populations , we limit sample galaxies to those with photometric redshifts @xmath4 .",

    "the actual fraction of compact galaxies for star - forming hieros are likely lower because most of them are not shown in this figure due to unreliable size measurements , which tend to have larger sizes based on stacking .",
    "this seems at odds with the findings of  @xcite , who revealed a paucity of compact star - forming galaxies in their @xmath23 galaxy samples .",

    "they are 23 magnitudes fainter in the rest - frame uv than lbgs with the same stellar mass and tend to be above the irx@xmath53 relation . thus both stellar mass and star formation rates based purely on uv are underestimated .",
    "the @xmath4 hieros have typical sfr @xmath12240  yr@xmath13 and ssfr @xmath124.2  gyr@xmath13 , double the rates for similarly massive @xmath71 galaxies and suggesting that the ssfr for massive galaxies continue to increase at @xmath72 yet with a decreased growth rate compared to that at @xmath80 .",
    "this is consistent with recent findings for less massive and for uv - selected galaxies .",
    "there are similar numbers of compact quiescent and star - forming galaxies among the @xmath4 hieros , with the star - forming ones being at higher redshifts than quiescent galaxies ( @xmath108 vs.  @xmath123 ) .",
    "this suggests that even the earliest quenched systems may have gone through a compact star - forming phase which started at an even earlier epoch , providing important constraints on the formation of compact quiescent galaxies . for the total @xmath4 hiero population ,",
    "both their number densities and sizes match those of the most massive ( @xmath124  ) quiescent galaxies at @xmath93 , providing the most plausible star - forming progenitors .",
    "the hiero selection provides a reliable and representative sample of massive galaxies at @xmath27 . although rough constraints on their typical physical properties can be obtained through stacking , their general faintness in the rest - frame uv - to - optical inhibits accurate determination of the physical properties for individual galaxies with current optical and nir facilities . on the other hand , their brightness in the mid- to far - infrared make jwst and alma promising tools to further explore their nature in great detail .",
