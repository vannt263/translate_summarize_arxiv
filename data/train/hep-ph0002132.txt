    "a generic inclusive cross section for the process @xmath0 with observed final - state system @xmath1 , of total mass @xmath2 , can be expressed as q^4 d_abfxdq^2 & = & _ a / a(x_a,^2 ) _ b / b(x_b,^2 ) + &  & _ abfx(z , q , ) , [ basicfact ] with @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath4 are partonic hard - scattering functions , @xmath5 they are known to nlo for most processes in the standard model and its popular extensions .",

    "( [ basicfact ] ) and ( [ momentact ] ) are starting - points for both the determination and the application of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , @xmath9 , using 1-loop @xmath10 s @xcite we may think of this collective enterprise as an  nlo model \" for the pdfs , and for hadronic hard scattering in general . for precision applications",
    "we ask how well we really know the pdfs @xcite . partly this is a question of how well data constrain them , and",
    "partly it is a question of how well we _ could _ know them , given finite - order calculations in eqs .",
    "( [ basicfact ] ) and ( [ momentact ] ) .",
    "we will not attempt here to assign error estimates to theory .",
    "we hope , however , to give a sense of how to distinguish ambiguity from uncertainty , and how our partial knowledge of higher orders can reduce the latter .",
    "it is not obvious how to quantify a  theoretical uncertainty \" , since the idea seems to require us to estimate corrections that we havent yet calculated .",
    "we do not think an unequivocal definition is possible , but we can try at least to clarify the concept , by considering a hypothetical set of nucleon pdfs determined from dis data alone @xcite . to make such a determination , we would invoke isospin symmetry to reduce the set of pdf s to those of the proton , @xmath11 , and then measure a set of singlet and nonsinglet structure functions , which we denote @xmath12 .",
    "each factorized structure function may be written in moment space as f^(i)(n , q ) = _ a c^(i)_a(n , q , ) _ a / p(n,^2 ) , [ disfact ] in terms of which we may solve for the parton distributions by inverting the matrix @xmath13 , _ a / p(n,^2 ) = _ i c^-1^(i)_a(n , q,)f^(i)(n , q ) .",

[ delphidelc ]",
    "our question now becomes , how well do we know the @xmath15 s ?",
    "in fact this is a subtle question , because the coefficient functions depend on choices of scheme and scale .",
    "factorization schemes are procedures for defining coefficient functions perturbatively .",
    "for example , choosing for @xmath16 the lo ( quark ) coefficient function in eq .",
    "( [ solvephi ] ) defines a dis scheme ( with @xmath13 independent of @xmath17 , which is then to be taken as @xmath2 in @xmath18 ) .",
    "computing the @xmath15 s from partonic cross sections by minimal subtraction to nlo defines an nlo @xmath19 scheme , and so on .",
    "once the choices of @xmath15 s and @xmath17 are made , the pdf s are defined uniquely .",
    "evolution in an @xmath19 or related scheme , enters through _ a / h(n,^2 ) & = & - _ ab(n , _",
    "s(^2 ) ) _ b / h(n,^2 ) + c^(i)_c(n , q , ) & = & c^(i)_d(n , q , ) _",
    "dc(n,_s(^2 ) ) . [ evol ] in principle , by eq .",
    "( [ evol ] ) , the scale - dependence of the @xmath20 exactly cancels that of the pdfs in eq .",
    "( [ disfact ] ) and , by extension , in eq .",
    "( [ basicfact ] ) .",
    "this cancelation , however , requires that each @xmath15 and the anomalous dimensions @xmath21 be known to all orders in perturbation theory .    to eliminate @xmath17-dependence up to order @xmath22 , we need @xmath10 to order @xmath23 and the @xmath24 to @xmath22 .",
    "one - loop ( nlo ) qcd corrections to hard scattering require two - loop splitting functions , which are known .",
    "the complete form of the nnlo splitting functions , is still somewhere over the horizon @xcite .",
    "even when these are known , it will take some time before more than a few hadronic hard scattering functions are known at nnlo .",
    "we can clarify the role of higher orders by relating structure functions at two scales,@xmath25 and @xmath2 .",
    "once we have measured @xmath26 , we may predict @xmath27 in terms of the relevant anomalous dimensions and coefficient functions by f(n , q ) & = & f(n , q_0 )  e^_q_0^q d ( n,_s(^2 ) ) + &  & . [",
    "predict ] this prediction , formally independent of pdfs _ and _ independent of the factorization scale , has corrections from the next , still uncalculated order in the anomalous dimension and in the ratio of coefficient functions .",
    "the asymptotic freedom of qcd gives a special role to lo : only the one - loop contribution to @xmath21 diverges with @xmath2 in the exponent , and contributes to the leading , logarithmic scale breaking .",
    "nlo corrections already decrease as the inverse of the logarithm of @xmath2 , nnlo as two powers of the log .",
    "thus , the theory is self - regulating towards high energy , where dependence on uncalculated pieces in the coefficients and anomalous dimensions becomes less and less important .",
    "the general successes of the nlo model strongly suggest that relations like ( [ predict ] ) are well - satisfied for a wide range of observables and values of @xmath28 ( or @xmath29 ) in dis and other processes .",
    "this does not mean , however , that we have no knowledge of , or use for , information from higher orders .",
    "in particular , near @xmath30 pdfs are rather poorly known @xcite . at the same time , the ratio of @xmath15 s depends on @xmath28 , and if @xmath31 is large , it becomes important to control higher - order dependence on @xmath32 .",
    "this is a task usually referred to as resummation , to which we now turn .",
    "let us continue our discussion of dis , describing what is known about the @xmath28-dependence of the coefficient functions @xmath15 , as a step toward understanding the role of higher orders .",
    "specializing again for simplicity to nonsinglet or valence , the resummed coefficient function may be written as @xcite c^res(n , q , ) = c^nlo_sub(n , q,)+ c_^dis e^e_dis(n , q , ) , [ cresum ] where  _ sub _ \" implies a subtraction on @xmath33 to keep @xmath34 exact at order @xmath35 , and where @xmath36 corresponds to the nlo @xmath28-independent ( `` hard virtual '' ) terms .",

    ", higher orders can be quite important .",
    "what does this mean for pdfs ?",
    "we can certainly refit pdfs with resummed coefficient functions , and we see that the high moments of such pdfs are likely to be quite different from those from nlo fits .    to get a sense of how such an nll / nlo-@xmath19 scheme might differ from a classic nlo-@xmath19 scheme , we resort to a model set of resummed distributions , determined as follows .",
    "we define valence pdfs in the resummed scheme by demanding that their contributions to @xmath16 match those of the corresponding nlo valence pdfs at a fixed @xmath44 , which is ensured by ^res(n , q_0 ^ 2)=^nlo(n , q_0 ^ 2 ) .",
    "[ fresdef ] using the resummed parton densities from eq .",
    "( [ fresdef ] ) , we can generate the ratios @xmath45 .",

    "the nlo distributions were those of @xcite , and the inversion of moments was performed as in @xcite .",
    "the effect of resummation is moderate for most @xmath2 . at small values of @xmath2 , and large @xmath29",
    ", the resummed structure function shows a rather sharp upturn .",
    "one also finds a gentle decrease toward very large @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "we could interpret this difference as the _ uncertainty _ in the purely nlo valence pdfs implied by resummation .    from this simplified example",
    ", we can already see that the use of resummed coefficient functions is not likely to make drastic differences in global fits to pdfs based on dis data , at least so long as the region of small @xmath41 , of 10 gev@xmath42 or below , is avoided at very large @xmath29 . at the same time , it is clear that a resummed fit will make some difference at larger @xmath29 , where pdfs are not so well known .",
    "we stress that a full global fit will be necessary for complete confidence .",
    "processes other than dis play an important role in global fits , and in any case are of paramount phenomenological interest .",
    "potential sources of large corrections can be identified quite readily in eq .",
    "( [ momentact ] ) . at higher orders , factors such as @xmath48 , can be as large as unity over the physically relevant range of @xmath49 in some processes . in this case",
    ", they , and their scale dependence can be competitive with nlo contributions . since they make up well - defined parts of the correction at each higher order , however",
    ", it is possible to resum them . to better determine pdfs in regions of phase space where such corrections are important",
    ", we may incorporate resummation in the hard - scattering functions that determine pdfs .",
    "the drell - yan cross section is the benchmark for the resummation of logs of @xmath50 , or equivalently , logarithms of the moment variable @xmath28 @xcite , _",

    "( [ edisdef ] ) for dis , eq .",
    "( [ edydef ] ) resums all leading and next - to - leading logarithms of @xmath28 .",
    "it has been noted in several phenomenological applications that threshold resummation , and even fixed - order expansions based upon it , significantly reduce sensitivity to the factorization scale @xcite . to see why , we rewrite the moments of the drell - yan cross section in resummed form as ^dy_ab(n , q ) & & + & & = _ q _ q / a(n , ) _",

    "this surprising relation holds because the function @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ abdef ] ) equals the residue of the @xmath53 term in the splitting function @xmath54 .",
    "thus , the remaining @xmath28-dependence in a resummed cross section still begins at order @xmath55 , but the part associated with the @xmath53 term in the splitting functions has been canceled to all orders .",
    "of course , the importance of the remaining sensitivity to @xmath17 depends on the kinematics and the process .",
    "in addition , although resummed cross sections can be made independent of @xmath17 for all @xmath32 , they are still uncertain at next - to - next - to leading logarithm in @xmath28 , simply because we do not know the function @xmath51 at three loops .",
    "notice that none of these results depends on using pdfs from a resummed scheme , because @xmath19 pdfs , whether resummed or nlo , evolve the same way .",
    "the remaining , uncanceled dependence on the scales leaves room for an educated use of scale - setting arguments @xcite .",
    "the connection between resummation and the elimination of scale dependence has also been emphasized in @xcite .",
    "scale dependence aside , can we in good conscience combine resummed hard scattering functions in eq .",
    "( [ basicfact ] ) with pdfs from an nlo scheme ?",
    "this would nt make much sense if resummation significantly changed the coefficient functions with which the pdfs were originally fit . as fig .",
    "[ fratio ] shows , however , this is unlikely to be the case for dis at moderate @xmath29 .",
    "thus , it makes sense to apply threshold resummation with nlo pdfs to processes and regions of phase space where there is reason to believe that logs are more important at higher orders than for the input data to the nlo fits .    at the same time , a set of fits that includes threshold resummation in their hard - scattering functions can be made @xcite , and their comparison to strict nlo fits would be quite interesting .",
    "indeed , such a comparison would be a new measure of the influence of higher orders .",
    "a particularly interesting example might be to compare resummed and nlo fits using high-@xmath56 jet data @xcite .",
    "in addition to higher orders in @xmath57 , eq .",
    "( [ basicfact ] ) has corrections that fall off as powers of the hard - scattering scale @xmath2 .",
    "in contrast to higher orders , these corrections require a generalization of the _ form _ of the factorized cross section . often power corrections are parameterized as @xmath58 $ ] in inclusive dis , where they begin at twist four . in dis",
    ", this higher twist term influences pdfs when included in joint fits with the nlo and nnlo models , and vice - versa @xcite . as in the case with higher orders , such ",
    "power - improved \" fits should be treated as new schemes .",
    "the success of nlo fits to dis and the studies of resummation above suggest that over most of the range of @xmath29 , theoretical uncertainties of the nlo model are not severe . at the same time , to fit large @xmath29 with more confidence than is now possible may require including the resummed coefficient functions .",
    "resummation is especially desirable for global fits that employ a variety of processes , such as dis and high-@xmath56 jet production , which differ in available phase space near partonic threshold . in a strictly nlo approach ,",
    "uncalculated large corrections are automatically incorporated in the pdfs themselves . as a result , the nlo model can not be expected to fit simultaneously the large-@xmath29 regions of processes with differing logs of @xmath59 in their hard - scattering functions , unless these higher - order corrections are taken into account .",
    "the results illustrated in the figures suggest that these considerations may be important in dis with @xmath41 below a few gev@xmath42 and at large @xmath29 , where they may have substantial effects on estimates of higher twist in dis . in hadronic scattering , large-@xmath28 ( @xmath60 ) resummation , which automatically reduces scale dependence , may play an even more important role than in dis .",
