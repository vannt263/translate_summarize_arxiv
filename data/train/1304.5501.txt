    "stacking several layers of graphene on top of each other does not immediately lead to graphite .",
    "as long as the number of layers is small enough , the two - dimensional nature of the system is preserved , i.e. the ( quasi ) momentum of the particles is oriented within the plane .",
    "the properties of these systems depend heavily on the way the layers are stacked and typically differ considerably from both monolayer graphene and graphite .",
    "there are two natural ways to stack graphene layers , namely ab or bernal stacking and abc ( rhombohedral ) stacking . in bernal stacked multilayer graphene ,",
    "the odd layers all have the same orientation , and so do the even layers .",
    "the orientation of the even layers is such that the @xmath0 sublattice sites are opposite to the @xmath1 sublattice sites of the layers directly beneath and above it .",
    "the @xmath1 sublattice sites are located opposite to honeycomb centers . in rhombohedral stacked graphene",
    ", every layer is oriented such that the @xmath0 sublattice is on top of the honeycomb centers of the layer beneath it and the @xmath1 sublattice is on top of the @xmath0 sublattice of the layer beneath it .",
    "this results in a cyclic structure through different orientations .",
    "hence , the layers @xmath2 and @xmath3 are exactly on top of each other . this lattice structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7.1 ] .",
    "although a recent theoretical work investigates systems in which the stacking of the layers is partly bernal and partly rhombohedral,@xcite so far most of the effort has been put into understanding either completely bernal or completely rhombohedral stacked multilayer samples .",
    "these two systems behave very differently . in bernal",
    "stacked multilayers , there are multiple low - energy bands , i.e. quasi particles with different dispersions . when the number of layers is even ( @xmath4 ) , the @xmath5 low - energy conduction bands are all parabolic ( bilayer - like ) , but with different effective masses , while for an odd number of layers ( @xmath6 ) a linear band with the same slope as the energy band in monolayer graphene exists next to the @xmath5 parabolic ones.@xcite the valence bands are related to the conduction bands by particle hole symmetry . on the other hand , for abc - stacked multilayers",
    ", the low - energy physics takes place on the sublattice sites on the outer layers that do not have a direct neighbor in the next layer . as a result",
    ", it is possible to construct an effective @xmath7 hamiltonian that is valid for energies @xmath8 ev.@xcite from this effective model , it is easy to derive that the energy bands at small momenta and low energies disperse as @xmath9 , i.e. the bands become very flat when @xmath10 increases . at the @xmath11 point ,",
    "where the conduction and valence bands touch , the dispersion of the bands results into a diverging density of states when @xmath12 .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to bernal stacked graphene , where the density of states never diverges at the dirac point .",
    "the integer quantum hall effect could be a way to identify the different stacking orders .",
    "this is because the landau level spectrum is very different in the two systems.@xcite for example , in the trilayer case the landau levels disperse with the magnetic field @xmath13 as @xmath14 for rhombohedral stacking , while the linear and parabolic bands in bernal stacked trilayers give rise to two sets of landau levels .",
    "one set disperses as a graphene monolayer , @xmath15 , while the other behaves as @xmath16 , just as a graphene bilayer does .",
    "hence , the landau levels cross as a function of the magnetic field.@xcite this fundamental difference is true for any @xmath12 multilayer system : when the stacking is bernal the landau levels cross , while for abc - stacked systems they do not ( as long as the high - energy bands are neglected ) . due to the low mobility of most multilayer graphene samples , much higher magnetic fields are required to observe the quantization of the hall conductance .",
    "nevertheless , for both bernal and rhombohedral stacked trilayer graphene the integer quantum hall effect is observed in experiment.@xcite in the bernal stacked case , hexagonal boron nitride was used as a substrate,@xcite increasing the mobility by a factor of @xmath17 .",
    "this technique may be used in the future to observe the quantum hall effect in graphene multilayers with an even higher number of layers .",
    "although the integer quantum hall effect was observed promptly , it took much longer to confirm that the fractional quantum hall effect exists in graphene . as a result , the importance of the coulomb interaction in graphene has long been debated .",
    "theoretical predictions of interaction effects had been made , such as a ferromagnetic phase transition in monolayer , bilayer , and later also in trilayer graphene.@xcite the observation of the fractional quantum hall effect in 2009 confirmed that interactions do play a role in graphene physics .",
    "the groups of eva andrei and philip kim reported the quantum hall plateau in suspended graphene with high mobility at filling factor @xmath18 , using a two - terminal device.@xcite however , a two - terminal setup can not provide an unambiguous proof of the existence of the phenomenon .",
    "the issue has only been definitively settled after a four - terminal device was used to observe the @xmath18 plateau in suspended graphene@xcite and several other plateaus at fractional filling factors in graphene on hexagonal boron nitride.@xcite the importance of interactions in graphene was later reiterated by other experiments , for example the renormalization of the fermi velocity due to the coulomb interaction in monolayers.@xcite in addition , there is evidence that the fractional quantum hall effect also occurs in suspended bilayer and trilayer samples.@xcite    the coulomb interaction is always present in systems that consist of many charged particles , like electrons .",
    "the importance of electromagnetic interactions depends on the properties of the system .",
    "the ratio of the coulomb to kinetic energy @xmath19 is a measure of the influence that the coulomb interaction has on the system .",
    "when the kinetic energy dominates and @xmath19 is small , the system can be described as a fermi liquid .",
    "when @xmath19 is large new phases can occur .",
    "for a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the effective mass of the electrons , @xmath22 the electron charge , @xmath23 the dielectric constant , and @xmath24 the density of electrons . hence , for low electron densities the coulomb interaction dominates and other phases , for example a wigner crystal , can form .",
    "the @xmath25 dependence is the result of the coulomb interaction @xmath26 and a quadratic kinetic energy @xmath27 . when the dispersion is not quadratic , @xmath19 will become a different function of the electron density .    in monolayer graphene ,",
    "the charge carriers behave as massless relativistic particles . therefore",
    ", the kinetic energy scales with momentum or @xmath28 , instead of momentum squared or @xmath24 as it was the case in the 2deg .",
    "hence , the parameter @xmath19 depends only on material parameters and is independent of electron doping @xmath29.@xcite for graphene , @xmath23 is the average dielectric constant of the material below and above the graphene layer , i.e. @xmath30 for suspended graphene in vacuum and @xmath31 for graphene on a sio@xmath32 substrate .",
    "thus , @xmath33 and @xmath34 for these two cases , respectively . compared to a typical 2deg , graphene is weakly interacting .",
    "however , close to the charge neutrality point the density of states vanishes . as a consequence , there are not many electrons available for screening and the coulomb interaction is almost unscreened , thus remaining long ranged .",
    "indeed , the thomas - fermi screening vector , which is the @xmath35 limit of the polarization , scales with the fermi energy and therefore vanishes if the system is close to half filling.@xcite in the short - wavelength limit , where @xmath36 is large , the polarization is linear and , in this regime , the effect of screening is a renormalization of the interaction strength .    for bilayer graphene ,",
    "the parameter @xmath19 scales as @xmath37.@xcite hence , close to half filling , where @xmath38 , the interaction term should dominate the kinetic term . however , not only is it very difficult to produce a charge neutral system , due to the formation of electron hole puddles,@xcite it is also no longer true that the thomas - fermi vector vanishes for @xmath38 .",
    "the thomas - fermi vector is independent of the density of electrons in bilayer graphene .",
    "therefore , screening is more profound in bilayers than in monolayers of graphene .",
    "the polarization can be calculated analytically and from the polarization it is possible to construct the screened potential.@xcite due to the two - dimensional nature of the system , the potential is not exponentially screened , but remains polynomial .    for abc - stacked multilayers with three or more layers ,",
    "the density of states diverges at the charge neutrality point .",
    "since the thomas - fermi vector scales with the density of states , it is expected that screening is important for such systems .",
    "although screening in multilayer graphene has recently been studied numerically,@xcite we use a different approach , in which the small momentum and the large momentum parts are calculated independently .",
    "the approximation of the polarization function that we obtain in this way is valid for all momenta and low electron doping levels .",
    "since the numerical calculation of the full polarization function is a time consuming process , our results can be used to include screening in multilayer graphene in an efficient and computational - friendly way .",
    "the aim of this paper is to determine the polarization and the screened potential in rhombohedral stacked multilayers .",
    "firstly , two models are introduced in section [ model7 ] . in the full - band model",
    "the full @xmath39 hamiltonian is used , while in the two - band model an effective @xmath7 matrix is introduced . in section [ bubble7 ] ,",
    "the polarization is calculated in the two - band model and it is shown that this approximation breaks down for large momenta .",
    "although we analytically derive the formal integrals which have to be solved to calculate the polarization in @xmath10 layers of graphene , we solve the problem numerically only for abc - stacked trilayer graphene , as an example .",
    "we also show results for the full - band model .",
    "the screened coulomb potentials are derived for the two - band model in section [ pot7 ] and a realistic sketch of the screened potential is drawn in the full - band model .",
    "we discuss our results in section [ concl7 ] and compare them with both ref .   and ref .  .",
    "our results for the bilayer agree with the exact results derived in ref .  , but differ from the numerical ones obtained by min et al.@xcite for multilayer systems , the results in ref .",
    "do not display a linear regime , whereas according to our model this linear regime should become visible in the parameter range considered by them .",
    "to describe an abc - stacked multilayer of graphene with @xmath10 layers , we use a nearest - neighbor tight - binding model .",
    "hence , the electrons can tunnel to adjacent lattice sites within the same layer ( with energy @xmath40 ev ) or to direct neighbors at a distance @xmath41  in other layers ( with energy @xmath42 ev ) .",
    "the noninteracting tight - binding hamiltonian in real space is given by @xmath43 if @xmath44 , then @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron on lattice site @xmath2 in layer @xmath47 with spin @xmath48 .",
    "+ since the unit cell of this system contains @xmath49 lattice sites , the reciprocal space representation of this hamiltonian is a @xmath39 matrix . after expanding around the @xmath11 point",

    "the electrons on sites with a neighbor in an opposite layer will dimerise and the energy bands associated with these electrons will move away from the charge neutrality point .",
    "this results in two energy bands close to the charge neutrality point , while the other energy bands split away from zero by an energy @xmath54 .",
    "hence , for an abc - stacked multilayer of graphene , the low - energy physics takes place on the @xmath55 and the @xmath56 sites .",

    "the calculations were performed within both the full - band model and the two - band model , an effective low - energy model in which the @xmath39 matrices reduce in size to @xmath7 .",
    "the advantage of the effective model is that it becomes easier to calculate the polarization numerically .",
    "the drawback is that the large-@xmath36 behavior of the polarization becomes flawed . instead of the linear behavior @xmath169 at large @xmath36 , which is imposed by the linearity of the energy bands farther away from the dirac points ,",
    "the polarization drops off as @xmath160 in the two - band model .",
    "it is very time consuming to calculate the full - band polarization numerically , such that the results of the two - band model are of great help to understand the behavior of @xmath132 in the full - band model .",
    "one has to be aware that in the effective model only the @xmath55 and @xmath56 lattice sites are involved .",
    "therefore , we can say nothing about the polarization functions between other lattice sites in this approximation .",

    "[ fig7.7 ] , we see some similarities .",
    "as long as the fermi energy is nonzero the total polarization is finite everywhere .",
    "the @xmath35 limit is proportional to the density of states , just as in the bilayer case .",
    "this is in fact true for any @xmath10-layer abc - stacked sample .",
    "it is important to realize that , although the plots look similar , the absolute values of @xmath177 are much higher for the abc - stacked trilayer than for the bilayer .",
    "this is because the density of states is much higher .",
    "the normalized polarization has a peak as @xmath36 increases and then a cross over to a linear regime takes place if @xmath36 is further increased .",
    "this cross over is not captured by the two - band model .",
    "there are also differences in the behavior of bilayer and trilayer samples .",
    "the peak in the bilayer is located exactly at @xmath62 and has a discontinuity in the first derivative . for the trilayer",
    "the peak is smoother and the maximum is reached before @xmath62 .",
    "the discontinuity in the first derivative at @xmath62 remains , although it is less pronounced .",
    "also for the bilayer the crossing to the linear regime is shifting to smaller momenta ( measured in units of @xmath103 ) when the fermi momentum increases .",
    "the slope of the linear part is different for the trilayer compared with the bilayer ( and the monolayer ) .",
    "this can be explained by the existence of more valence bands which are filled in the trilayer . in general , for an abc - stacked @xmath10-layer system , there are @xmath57 filled valence bands ( and also @xmath57 empty conduction bands ) further away from zero energy .",
    "these bands are expected to give a contribution when computing the full - band polarization .",
    "hence , there is no reason that the slope of the linear asymptote should be independent of layer number @xmath10 .",
    "we expect that the slope of the linear part of the total polarization increases further when @xmath10 grows larger . the static polarization for monolayer graphene is constant up to @xmath117 and then becomes linear with a slope @xmath178.@xcite comparing this with the slope of the bilayer @xmath179 , and the trilayer @xmath180 , a trend is seen .",

    "[ fig7.e ] , a direct comparison between the exact results from gamayun@xcite(blue nonlinear line ) and our approximation for a graphene bilayer is shown for @xmath181 .",
    "as expected , our asymptotic results agree with his in the small ( dotted line ) and large ( red linear line ) momenta regimes . on the other hand , if we compare our results with ref .  , we do not find a good agreement . for a doping level @xmath182 , similar to the one used to derive fig .",
    "[ fig7.e ] , the results shown in fig .  2 of ref .",
    "disagree with both ours and gamayun s exact result for the bilayer .",
    "although the curves have the same qualitative shape , exhibiting a small cusp at @xmath117 ( their cusp peaks at a higher value compared to the exact results ) , the onset to the linear regime is not clearly seen in their figure .",
    "a linear fit to their large-@xmath36 results does not extrapolate through the origin , as it should .",
    "although this transition could take place at larger @xmath36-values than those shown in their figure , the linear regime is clearly seen in the results of gamayun , within the parameter range considered by them , especially for large electron densities ( @xmath183 @xmath184 ) .",
    "this absence of a linear regime in ref .   occurs for bilayers , as well as for trilayers .",
    "this is an important difference , because for the trilayer we expect the linear regime to become dominant in more or less the same region as in the bilayer case .",
    "although in our fig .",
    "[ fig7.6a ] the fermi energy is chosen to be quite high to emphasize the effect , and the transition to the linear regime shifts to larger momenta when the electron doping is reduced , there is no sign of the linear regime in the trilayer results of ref .  .",
    "the validation of our findings by comparison with exact results for the bilayer makes us confident that the linear behavior for the trilayer , which we have obtained numerically , is a valid and important feature .",
    "moreover , our method should be especially valuable for evaluating the screening in systems with a higher number of layers , when exact numerical calculations become very time consuming .",
    "the unscreened coulomb potential @xmath185 with interaction strength @xmath186 diverges as @xmath35 .",
    "if @xmath187 , the polarization diverges as well for @xmath35 .",
    "the screened potential will converge to zero in this limit , @xmath188 . when @xmath123 , the potential will be finite and nonzero everywhere .",
    "the screened potential has a local minimum and will converge to a renormalized version of the unscreened potential in the large-@xmath36 limit .",
    "due to the linear behavior of the polarization @xmath189 at large momenta , the screened potential is just the unscreened one with a renormalized interaction strength in this regime .",
    "the new interaction strength has the form @xmath190 since @xmath191 is positive , the interaction strength will be reduced .",
    "a sketch of the screened potential is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7.6b ] .    with the insights gained here ,",
    "we conclude that the simplified model for the polarization proposed in ref .   to include the effect of screening in the ferromagnetic phase transition in abc - stacked trilayer can be further refined . indeed , instead of using the slope for the bilayer , @xmath192",
    ", we have found that the precise value for trilayers should be @xmath193 . as a result , the critical couplings , and therefore also the critical doping levels , are reduced .",
    "the reduction of the interaction parameter @xmath186 becomes larger when @xmath186 increases .",
    "for @xmath194 the extra reduction is around @xmath195 .",
    "since the phase boundary @xmath196 is quite flat for @xmath197 , the critical curve of the screened case in the phase diagram will not change drastically .    in sum",
    ", the results presented here allow one to determine the effect of ( static ) screening in @xmath10 layers of abc - stacked graphene and should thus contribute to more accurate calculations of interaction phenomena in multilayer graphene .",
    "our results for the bilayer are a good approximation of the exact expression derived by gamayun.@xcite since the small momentum behavior of the polarization is governed by the two - band model and the high - momentum part of the polarization is caused by the linearity of the energy bands further away from the dirac point , our results are intuitively correct .",
    "although a direct comparison between our results and those of ref .   is difficult , because in their studies the linear regime has not yet been reached , we expect from our model that their results should already start converging towards the linear asymptote for the regime of parameters considered .",
    "since the results of this paper are valid for any abc - stacked multilayer system , they allow for a realistic inclusion of screening phenomena in multilayer systems in a way that all the characteristics of the polarization function are included .",
    "the number of trilayer and multilayer experiments is increasing over the last few years , hence theoretical work is needed as well .",
    "our results , which connect the universal low - momentum part and the high - momentum linear regime of the polarization , could be a useful tool to include screening in a more realistic and practical manner in the description of these fascinating materials .",
