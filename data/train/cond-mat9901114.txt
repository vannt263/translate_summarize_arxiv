    "the physics of holes moving in an af background has received much attention because of its possible connection to high - t@xmath6 superconductivity . a microscopic realization of this physics is given by the @xmath0-@xmath2 model which was first introduced as a conjecture @xcite , and then derived as a low - energy limit of a realistic model representing the electronic structure of cuprates @xcite .",

    "unfortunately , numerical studies alone are of limited use for this purpose , so that an analytical study is necessary to develop an insight into the problem .",

    "their contribution to the hole energy is small in a wide range of @xmath5 , but they are responsible for the finite coherent band of the hole .",

    "since @xmath54 and @xmath55 are momentum - independent and the hole - magnon interaction depends only on @xmath56 , the full green s function @xmath57 is also @xmath32-independent .",

    "( [ scba ] ) as @xmath67 this is inconsistent with the result of the real - space approach @xmath68",

    "@xcite @xmath74 this comparison makes one to suspect that scba ( eq.([w_0_2 ] ) ) overestimates both the absolute value of the depth of the `` band '' and the slope of the walls of the linear confining potential .",

    "if @xmath0 is much larger than @xmath2 , the average length of the strings contributing to the spin - polaron wave function is large .",
    "then the weight of the components with coordination number different from others becomes insignificant .",
    "since this component is the `` bare '' hole , it also means that the quasiparticle residue of the state decreases as @xmath0 grows and in the @xmath78 limit the spectrum will be incoherent .",
    "this result was first obtained by brinkmann and rice @xcite in the @xmath13 limit .",
    "( 2,3 ) ( 3,0.5 )    having in mind that the energy of spin excitation is determined by the number of broken af bonds associated with its creation , one can see that the energy of the first magnon in the string is @xmath69 ( 3 bonds , @xmath79 each ) , but the energy of each subsequent magnon is just @xmath2 ( 2 bonds ) .",
    "this is true for all strings of length @xmath80 and for most other longer strings except for those which have self - tangencies .",
    "since the latter cases are relatively rare due to the geometrical factor , one can assign the same energy @xmath81 to every string of length @xmath82 . a more accurate account for the energy of the self - tangient strings",
    "makes only tiny changes to the energy of the whole excitation .",

    "( [ w_0_3 ] ) .    summarizing the results of the comparison one can say that the reason for the failure of the scba is that @xmath65 is not the same as @xmath87 and that an improved formalism must take into account the following facts : ( i ) the energy of the first magnon in a string is @xmath69 , ( ii ) the energy of the @xmath88th magnon ( @xmath89 ) is @xmath2 , ( iii ) the coordination number is @xmath75 for @xmath90 and @xmath20 for @xmath91 , where @xmath82 is the length of the string . after some thinking using the above real - space arguments one can suggest the following modification to the equation for the green s function ( [ scba ] ) to meet all these requirements @xmath92^{-1}\\ , \\nonumber \\\\ & & g_a(\\epsilon)=[\\epsilon-3t^2g_a(\\epsilon - j)]^{-1}\\ , \\\\ & & g_a(\\epsilon)=-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}t}\\frac{j_{-\\epsilon / j}(2\\sqrt{3}t / j ) }   { j_{-\\epsilon / j-1}(2\\sqrt{3}t / j)}\\ . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] such a modification gives the correct hole energy in the small @xmath0 limit . in the @xmath78",

    "-\\frac{16t^2}{j^2}\\bigg[\\gamma_{\\bf k}\\gamma_{\\bf p}-\\frac{\\alpha}{2 } \\gamma_{\\bf k+p}(\\gamma_{\\bf k}^2+\\gamma_{\\bf p}^2)\\bigg ] \\bigg\\ } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] corrections to the bound state energies of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 wave up to first order in @xmath259 are : @xmath266 where the first term in the bracket comes from the dispersion and the second is from the magnon - exchange interaction .",
    "the kinetic energy pushes up the energy of both states , but for the @xmath3-wave this shift is three times larger .",
    "an important observation is that the magnon - exchange interaction is now attractive for the @xmath4-wave and repulsive for the @xmath3-wave state !    to show how subtle the selection between the @xmath3- and @xmath4-wave ground state is , let us consider a more `` realistic '' dispersion law : @xmath267 it is more realistic in the sense that it has minima at @xmath268 points which are isotropic and it agrees with the experimentally measured profile in the cuprates better than the one in eq.([t_5 ] ) .",
    "it is now known that this difference between the @xmath0-@xmath2 model dispersion law ( eq.([t_5 ] ) ) and the one observed in reality ( eq.([t_5_4 ] ) ) is due to additional intrasublattice hoppings ( @xmath269 etc . ) in the real systems @xcite . with the dispersion law in eq .",
    "( [ t_5_4 ] ) corrections to the binding energies are given by : @xmath270 now the kinetic energy pushes up the @xmath4-wave energy @xmath271 times more than that of the @xmath3-wave and @xmath272 $ ] is not necessarily positive .",
    "therefore , @xmath3-wave can become a ground state again .",
    "summarizing our observations in the small @xmath259 limit , we conclude that the transverse fluctuations create an additional attractive interaction in the @xmath4-symmetry state and that an anisotropic kinetic energy profile also favors @xmath4-wave .",
    "thus , we suggest that the @xmath4-wave is most likely to be the ground state of the system in the @xmath0-@xmath2 model ( @xmath262 ) .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with many analytical and numerical studies .",
    "nevertheless , recent 32-site ed study showed that at @xmath273 the ground state of the two - hole @xmath0-@xmath2 model is a @xmath3-wave state with total momentum @xmath274 @xcite .",
    "( in our case momenta @xmath275 and @xmath274 are equivalent because of the existence of long - range order . )",
    "furthermore , such a behavior is also suggested by recent series - expansion calculations @xcite . due to the apparently strong finite - size effects on the ed results ,",
    "it is difficult to conclude whether this behavior will survive in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "nevertheless , these new data show that even in the pure @xmath0-@xmath2 model the final word on the problem of the symmetry of the bound state is still to come .",
    "besides effects arising from the @xmath0-@xmath2 model there are also concerns about the robustness of the bound states in the real system .",
    "the characteristic bound - state energy found in the @xmath0-@xmath2 model is of the order of @xmath276 in the physical region of @xmath5 .",
    "this energy is far below the accuracy of the model itself .",
    "this means that in order to describe the real materials , the low - energy model must include at least additional hopping terms ( @xmath269 etc . ) .",
    "it is worth noting again that because of these terms the realistic dispersion is isotropic , which , as we have just shown , can favor @xmath3-wave .",
    "more important conjecture can be made using the results of ref .",
    "@xcite and new ed data @xcite .",
    "since the isotropic dispersion involves higher kinetic energy , the overall pairing tendency is weakened by these additional hopping terms .",
    "it can push all the bound states up to the continuum , thus destroying the foundation of the preformed pair and phase separation scenarios well before the physical region of parameters is reached .",
    "in this paper we attempt to address the issue of how generic @xmath4-wave pairing in @xmath0-@xmath2-like models is and to clarify the problem of how this symmetry is selected among others .",
    "we have thoroughly examined the @xmath0-@xmath1 model by means of analytical diagrammatic study supplemented by our 32-site ed results .",
    "this formalism is tested in the one - hole problem and perfect agreement with ed results is found .",
    "the ground state of two holes in the physical region @xmath277 is found to be a @xmath3-wave bound state . from a careful analysis of the interactions involved in the pairing problem we established that the pairing in the @xmath120-wave channel is highly unfavorable because of the repulsive character of the magnon - exchange interaction in this state .",
    "while this reason is rather generic , the problem of selecting between the @xmath3- and @xmath4-wave is much more subtle . in our analytical study",
    "these states remain degenerate until the hole dispersion is included . in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model",
    "such a dispersion comes from higher order hopping processes and is , in fact , very small .",
    "however , it has important consequences .",
    "it is responsible not only for the significant splitting between the @xmath3- and @xmath4-wave states , but also for the destruction of hole pairing at some critical @xmath278 .",
    "the isotropic form of the dispersion favors @xmath3-wave as the ground state of the system .",
    "we have also considered the role of transverse fluctuations in the perturbative limit @xmath258 .",
    "they lead to an anisotropic hole dispersion and an additional hole - hole interaction .",
    "we have shown that both features favor @xmath4-wave as the lowest energy state . however , in this case the selection between @xmath3- and @xmath4-wave strongly relies on the anisotropic form of the hole dispersion , and such a dispersion does not agree with the experimentally measured dispersion in real systems . moreover , since the characteristic energy of the bound states found in the @xmath0-@xmath2 models is small , we are skeptical that these states can survive when additional kinetic energy terms are included in the model",
    ". our skepticism is supported by earlier studies @xcite and recent numerical data @xcite .",
    "such conclusions for the pairing problem in @xmath0-@xmath2-like models drawn from our study create a framework in which it might be necessary to look for @xmath4-wave superconductivity unrelated to the bose - condensation of preformed @xmath4-wave pairs . furthermore , to make the phase separation scenario possible , one might need to invoke arguments other than an _ a priori _ existing collapsing tendency in the spin - hole system .",
