    "the original authors discussed the low - field behavior in terms of one - dimensional ( 1d ) luttinger liquid ( ll ) model .",
    "many experiments however indicate that the electrical transports in swnt have a two - dimensional ( 2d ) character .",
    "@xcite in fact , the conductivity in individual nanotubes depends on the circumference and the pitch characterizing a space - curve ( 2d ) .",

    "carbon nanotubes are discovered by iijima .",
    "@xcite the important questions are how the electrons or other charged particles traverse the nanotubes and whether these particles are scattered by impurities and phonons or not . to answer these questions , we need the electron energy band structures .",

    "swnts can be produced by rolling graphene sheets into circular cylinders of about one nanometer ( nm ) in diameter and microns ( @xmath14 m ) in length .",
    "@xcite the electrical conduction in swnts depends on the circumference and pitch , and can be classified into two groups : either semiconducting or metallic .",
    "@xcite in our previous work @xcite , we have shown that this division in two groups arises as follows .",
    "a swnt is likely to have an integral number of carbon hexagons around the circumference .",
    "if each pitch contains an integral number of hexagons , then the system is periodic along the tube axis , and `` holes '' ( not `` electrons '' ) can move along the tube .",
    "such a system is semiconducting and its electrical conductivity increases with the temperature , and is characterized by an activation energy @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite the energy @xmath15 has a distribution since both pitch and circumference have distributions .",
    "the pitch angle is not controlled in the fabrication processes .",

    "this explains the horizontal stretch feature ( ii ) .    if the bias voltage is high enough so that the inequality symbol in eq .",
    "is reversed , then normal currents revert and exhibit the ohmic behavior , which explains the feature ( iii ) .    the feature ( iv ) can be explained as follows . for higher @xmath22",
    "there are more amounts of charge , and hence the charges @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 for the three cases ( a , b , c ) satisfy the inequalities : @xmath38 the horizontal stretches are longer for smaller bias voltages . at the end of the stretch ( @xmath39 ) the system energy equals the condensation energy @xmath29 .",
    "hence , we obtain from eq .   after dropping the kinetic energy @xmath31 @xmath40 using eq .  , we then obtain @xmath41 which explains the feature ( iv ) .",
    "the horizontal stretch becomes shorter as the gate voltage @xmath22 is raised ; it vanishes when @xmath22 is a little over @xmath17mv .",
    "the limit is given by @xmath42 if the charging energy @xmath43 exceeds the condensation energy @xmath29 , then there are no more supercurrents , which explains the feature ( v ) .",
    "clearly the important physical property in our pairon model is the condensation energy @xmath29 .    in the currently prevailing theory  @xcite",
    ", it is argued that the electron ( fermion ) motion becomes ballistic at a certain quantum condition . but",
    "all fermions are known to be subject to scattering .",
    "it is difficult to justify the reason why the ballistic electron is not scattered by impurities and phonons , which naturally exist in nanotubes .",
