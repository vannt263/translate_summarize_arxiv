    "advances in theory are often fore - shadowed by intuition .",
    "but the mathematical structures governing multipartite and even bipartite states and unitary transformations are complex , which makes many problems difficult to explore and intuition hard to develop . analyzing problems analytically is often a time - consuming process .",
    "validation of hypothesis is laborious and searching for counter - examples is a lengthy endeavor .",
    "the qit community will probably benefit from tools to accelerate these processes .",
    "the use of computers for theoretical mathematics is a well established , with a specialized journal @xcite , textbooks @xcite and numerous papers .",
    "wolfram research defines _",
    "experimental mathematics _ as  a type of mathematical investigation in which computation is used to investigate mathematical structures and identify their fundamental properties and patterns  @xcite .",
    "bailey and borwein@xcite use the term to mean the methodology of doing mathematics that includes the use of computation for    * gaining insight and intuition * discovering new patterns and relationships * using graphical displays to suggest underlying mathematical principles * testing and especially falsifying conjectures * exploring a possible result to see if it is worth formal proof * suggesting approaches for a formal proof * replacing lengthy hand derivations with computer - based derivations * confirming analytically derived results    as the benefits of tools such as mathematica , matlab and maple are clear , there is strong indication that field - specific software for experimental theoretical quantum information would be advantageous .",
    "qlib @xcite is an attempt to provide such a tool .",
    "qlib provides the tools to manipulate density matrices , separable states , pure states , classical probability distributions ( cpds ) as well as unitary and hermitian matrices .",
    "all of which are supported with any number of particles , and any number of degrees of freedom per particle .",
    "the following functions are provided to manipulate these objects :    * * entanglement calculations * : pure state entanglement , concurrence , negativity , tangle , logarithmic negativity , entanglement of formation , relative entanglement , robustness , pt - test ( peres horodecki ) , schmidt decomposition and singlet fraction . * * entropy * : shannon , von neumann , linear entropy , relative entropy , participation ratio , purity * * measurements * : orthogonal ( to multiple collapsed states or to a single mixture ) , povm , weak measurements * * object transformation : * * * reorder particles , partial trace , partial transpose * * transform objects to / from the regular representation to a tensoric representation with one index per particle if the original object was a vector , or two indexes per particle if the object was a matrix * * convert to / from computational base to the base of su(n ) generators * * distance measures * : hilbert - schmidt , trace distance , fidelity , kullback - leibler , bures distance , bures angle , fubini - study * * miscellaneous * : majorization , mutual information , spins in 3d , famous states , famous gates    qlib provides * parametrizations for all objects of interest * , density matrices , separable states , pure states , cpds , hermitian matrices and unitary matrices .",
    "in other words , these object are representable as points in a parameter space .",
    "this allows , for example , to generate random separable states or random unitary matrices . for details of each parametrization and its theoretical background",
    ", please refer to the on - line help . as an example",
    ", details of two unitary - matrix parametrizations and of one separable density matrix parametrization are presented in [ sec : sample - applications ] .",
    "the * robust optimization capabilities * provided with qlib , allows searching for extrema of functions defined over these spaces .",
    "the optimization is performed by alternating stages of hill - climbing and simulated annealing while applying consistency requirements to the output of the stages .",
    "current experience with the optimization feature suggests that the search succeeds in locating the global extrema in a surprising majority of the cases .",
    "finally qlib provides a wide selection of general purpose utilities which , while are not quantum - information specific , go a long way towards making the use of qlib productive and simple :    * linear algebra : gram schmidt , spanning a matrix using base matrices , checking for linear independence , etc . *",
    "numerics : approximately compare , heuristically clean - up computation results from tiny non - integer and/or tiny real / imaginary parts , etc .",
    "* graphics : quickly plot out functions in 2 and 3d , smoothing and interpolation techniques for noisy or sparse data , etc .",
    "qlib , available at ` www.qlib.info ` , has been designed for easy use .",
    "an _ installation guide _ and a _ getting started guide _ are available on the website , and over a dozen demos are provided as part of qlib , to help you get started .",
    "in addition , on - line help is available : simply type ` help qlib ` at the matlab prompt for an overview of functionality or get function - specific help , e.g. ` help partial_trace . `    finally ,",
    "user forums are available to ask questions and discuss qlib issues , and forms are provided to request new features or report bugs .",
    "following are a number of qlib usage example which were selected both for their ability to demonstrate qlib capabilities and for their relatively simple structure and simple theoretical background , so that they may be quickly understood by a wide range of readers .",
    "recently , some work has been done regarding the entanglement of superpositions @xmath0    an upper limit to the entanglement of @xmath1 has been proposed by linden , popescu and smolin @xcite",
    ". further work by gour @xcite added a tighter upper bound and a lower bound .",
    "unfortunately , the analytical form of these bounds make it difficult to get a good intuitive feel as to whether they are relatively tight or whether there is still significant room for improvement .",
    "qlib provides us with convenient tools with which to explore the problem .",
    "see figure 1 .    .",
    "generally speaking , gour is indeed tighter than lps , but not always ( note the top - left sub - figure at @xmath2 . also of note is the complex behavior exhibited by the entanglement of superposition and the relative un - tightness of existing bounds . ]    to create the graphs above , qlib s basic primitives have been used ( computation of entanglement for a pure state , normalization of a pure state , etc ) , as was the capability to generate random pure states . finally the optimization capabilities are also put to use , as gour s bounds are defined in terms of maximizing a function over a single degree of freedom for given @xmath3,@xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which requires that every point along the gour limit lines above be computed by an optimization process .      over the years there has been keen interest in the question of mems , maximally entangled mixed states , which can not be made more entangled ( as measured by some measure ) with any global unitary transformation @xcite .",
    "qlib can assist in exploration of this problem by searching for the most - entangling unitary transformation .",
    "parametrization of unitary transformations is done either by generalized euler angles @xcite or with the more naive@xmath7    with @xmath8 being the @xmath9    in this particular example , we have explored the maximal entanglement possible for the separable diagonal density matrix@xmath10    qlib can help discover the dependency of the maximal entanglement on @xmath11 , @xmath12 by locating the mems associated with the initial density matrix and visualizing various options for @xmath11 , @xmath12 dependence . see figure 2 .    .",
    "the @xmath13 $ ] space was explored with a resolution of @xmath14 , for a total of @xmath15 points , for each of which an optimization of the concurrence over the space of su(4 ) unitaries has been performed .",
    "the maximal concurrence is shown both as a function of @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( in 3d , above ) , and as a contour plot ( below ) showing the dependence of the maximal concurrence on the trace distance between the single - particle initial density matrix , @xmath16 , and the fully mixed state for a single qubit @xmath17.,title=\"fig : \" ] .",

    "this suggests a trivial generalization to higher dimensions as follows    @xmath21    with @xmath8 being the @xmath22 generators , with the assumption that if @xmath23 then the density matrix represents a pure state .    utilizing qlib s parametrization capabilities",
    ", we shall generate a large number of random pure states , separable states and general density matrices and plot the @xmath24 projections of the resulting bloch `` hyper - sphere '' , i.e. scatter plots of two components of @xmath25 .",
    "it is evident from figure 3 that no such trivial generalization is possible , and that the geometry of the problem is far more complex that can be naively guessed .",

    "blue dots indicate general density matrices .",
    "green are separable states and red dots indicate pure states.,title=\"fig : \" ]      another simple use of qlib is to experimentally test the additivity of entropy and entanglement measures@xmath26    by randomly generating multiple @xmath27-s and @xmath28-s and checking the additivity attribute for each , we can form a reliable hypothesis regarding the behavior of the measure in question .",
    "moreover , by extremizing @xmath29 over all possible @xmath27,@xmath28 one may reach an even more well - founded conclusion .",
    "of particular interest is the relative entanglement measure @xcite    @xmath30    which is a generalization of the classical relative entropy@xmath31    it is known that @xmath32 is non - additive @xcite .    to compute @xmath32 ,",
    "one must be able to compute @xmath33 , which in turn requires parametrization of the separable space . in qlib",
    "this is achieved using the observation of p. horodecki @xcite , that the separable space is convex , and thus each point within is constructable as a linear interpolation of a finite number of extremal points of that space , as per the caratheodory theorem .",
    "therefore , to parametrize all separable density matrices of dimension @xmath34 , one may parametrize @xmath35 separable pure states of the same dimensionality @xmath36 and a classic probability distribution @xmath37 to specify the mixing , resulting in the parametrization    @xmath38    the numerical study of @xmath32 additivity clearly indicate that the relative entanglement is super - additive , i.e.    @xmath39",
    "qlib is distributed as free software . the word  \" free  \"",
    "does not only refer to price ; primarily it refers to freedom : you may run the program , for any purpose , study how it works , adapt it to your needs , redistribute copies and improve the program .",
    "it is our hope is that qlib will evolve into a group effort , maintained , nurtured and grown by the quantum information community , for the benefit of us all . for that purpose ,",
    "we have licensed qlib under the gpl , or gnu public license , which sets - up both the freedom to use the software , and the requirement that any enhancements made to qlib be released back to the community .",
    "code which uses qlib , but is not part of it , may , of course , remain private . for more information regarding these issues ,",
