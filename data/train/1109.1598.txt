    "let @xmath2 be a commutative monoid ; we might be interested in natural operations @xmath3 .",
    "here is an example of a natural operation @xmath4 : @xmath5    such an operation consists of adding up some copies of the things we started with .",
    "we can regard this as a two - stage process : first we make copies , then we add .",
    "so we can factor this operation as @xmath6    in general we can associate natural operations to maps of finite sets :    * given a map @xmath7 of sets , we can produce a _ copying _ map @xmath8 via @xmath9 . * given a map @xmath10 of sets , we cap produce an _ addition _ map @xmath11 via @xmath12 .    of course ,",
    "we can compose these , and so given any diagram of finite sets @xmath13 we get an operation @xmath14 , which sends @xmath15 via @xmath16    we refer to a diagram of sets with this shape as a _",
    "span diagram_. it certainly seems natural to suggest that span diagrams should give all the natural operations on a commutative monoid",
    ". however , span diagrams @xmath17 and @xmath18 yield identical operations if they are isomorphic in the sense that @xmath19\\ar[dd]^\\wr&\\\\ x\\ar[ur]\\ar[dr]&&y\\\\ & y'\\ar[ur]&}\\ ] ] commutes .",
    "moreover , we can compose span diagrams : we use pullbacks : @xmath20\\ar[dr]&\\\\x&&y}}\\right ) \\circ \\left(\\vcenter{\\xymatrix@r-8pt@c-16pt{&v\\ar[dl]\\ar[dr]&\\\\y&&z}}\\right ) =   \\left(\\vcenter{\\xymatrix@r-8pt@c-16pt{&u{\\mathop{\\times}_{y}}v\\ar[dl]\\ar[dr]&\\\\x&&z}}\\right).\\ ] ] it can quickly be checked that this is the right thing to do , using the formula above for @xmath14 .",
    "these span diagrams thus form a category @xmath21 .",
    "hence it is reasonable to believe that this encodes the structure of commutative monoids precisely .",
    "in fact , there is a classical result that it does : a commutative monoid is the same thing as a product - preserving functor from @xmath21 to sets .",
    "the work of lawvere generalises this point of view considerably ; given a category @xmath22 generated under taking finite products by a single object , we say that @xmath22 is an _ algebraic theory _ and that a product - preserving functor from @xmath22 to sets is a _ model of @xmath22_.    we might aim to apply this to homotopy theory : badzioch @xcite has shown that the models of @xmath21 in @xmath23 are exactly the generalised eilenberg ",
    "mac lane spaces .",
    "his paper works in ordinary category theory , but a note observes that all results carry through in the world of simplicial categories",
    ".    we might hope for a different theory : frequently , a more useful notion of commutative monoid in @xmath23 is the notion of @xmath1-monoid @xcite .",
    "this is a monoid which is commutative only up to coherent homotopy .",
    "so we might ask , how might we change @xmath21 in order to get this more nuanced theory ?    to find an answer , we must realise that we lose valuable information when we pass to isomorphism classes of span diagrams to form the category @xmath21 .",
    "in order to preserve this information , we use _ quasicategories _ , as developed by joyal @xcite and lurie @xcite .",
    "a quasicategory is a simplicial set obeying some extra axioms : these axioms are slightly less stringent than the axioms for a kan complex .",
    "the philosophy is as follows : a category can be regarded as a simplicial set , via the standard nerve construction .",
    "but an @xmath24-groupoid ( a higher categorical object consisting of objects , invertible maps , and all higher homotopies between them ) can also be regarded as a kan complex ( consisting of points , 1-simplices and higher simplices ) , and hence also inhabits the world of simplicial sets .",
    "a quasicategory is a generalisation of both . in particular",
    ", it has :    * objects , represented by @xmath25-simplices ; * morphisms , represented by @xmath26-simplices , which need not be invertible ( as in an ordinary category ) ; * homotopies , represented by higher simplices , which are all invertible in some appropriate sense .    because of the nature of this theory , we shall use the terms `` 0-simplex '' , `` point '' and `` object '' interchangeably , and similarly also use the terms `` 1-simplex '' , `` edge '' and `` morphism '' interchangeably ( depending perhaps on whether we are thinking of the object as a simplicial set , as a model for a space , or as a generalised category ) .",
    "likewise , we find ourselves using `` functor '' and `` map '' interchangeably , when we do not wish to be precise about whether our objects or quasicategories or more general simplicial sets .",
    "we start with some preliminaries ( section [ 2-cats - quasicats ] ) , giving general results on quasicategories , and on their relation to lower - dimensional category theory .",
    "we then ( in section [ theories - generalities ] ) build a quasicategory @xmath27 which is the appropriate version of @xmath21 for @xmath1-objects in a quasicategory .",
    "as in the category @xmath21 , objects are finite sets , and morphisms are span diagrams .",
    "however , we build in higher simplices , which consist of more elaborate span - like diagrams in finite sets .",
    "the quasicategory @xmath27 turns out to be equivalent to a @xmath0-category : all the cells of degree @xmath28 or more are effectively uninteresting .",
    "this greatly facilitates technical checks of its properties .    after setting up @xmath27 and its basic properties",
    ", we spend some time proving that it does exactly what we want : we compare it to the classical theory of @xmath1-algebras and also to lurie s theory of commutative monoid objects .",
    "it is worth mentioning some of the potential consequences of this approach to universal algebra in quasicategories that are not realised in this paper .",
    "one perfectly general comment is that the approach is , in some senses , slightly more flexible than any operad - theoretic approach ( as in @xcite ) . in particular",
    ", an operad can only describe structures subject to axioms which do not mention any particular variable twice in the same formula : the distributive law @xmath29 is not accessible by this approach , since the right - hand side mentions the variable @xmath30 twice .",
    "so any operad - theoretic approach to ring objects must involve some indirection .    and",
    "it is indeed possible to give a description of the algebraic theory of @xmath1-ring ( or semiring ) objects which is built out of small diagrams , after the same fashion as spans .",
    "we postpone this to a future paper , since some considerable extra machinery is required .",
    "such a description is handy , as it places the monoidal structures corresponding to addition and to multiplication on the same footing : both are defined by way of span diagrams .",
    "this means that constructions which require blurring the distinction between the two , such as the construction of the group of units @xmath31 of an @xmath1 ring space , become natural .",
    "it is also possible to give a quick description of the group - completion of a theory , and the group - completion of a model of a theory .",
    "we similarly defer discussion of these constructions to future papers .      except for some of the material in section",
    "[ comparison - theorems ] , all the results in this paper appeared in the author s sheffield phd thesis @xcite under the direction of neil strickland .",
    "many people are thanked in that thesis , and those sentiments are as valid as before .",
    "the first aim of this section is to compare various notions of 2-category , in order to match jacob lurie s definition of a 2-category @xcite with the classical notions .",
    "there are several classical notions , with varying levels of strictness and laxity : as might be expected , it is simpler to construct the laxer versions , and simpler to use the stricter versions in constructions . at one end is the notion of a weak 2-category , and at the other is the notion of a strict 2-category @xcite .",
    "there is little essential difference , insofar as the work of street and his coauthors @xcite ( proved also in @xcite ) says that any weak 2-category can be replaced with an equivalent strict 2-category .",
    "a strict 2-category is exactly the same thing as a category enriched in categories , and we use this identification in what follows .",
    "the second aim is to prove some basic results on quasicategories , which will be useful later on .",
    "we use quasicategorical terminology without apology , even for arbitrary simplicial sets .",
    "thus a 0-cell will often be called an _ object _ of a simplicial set , and a 1-cell",
    "will often be called a _",
    "morphism_.    accordingly , when we use the word `` space '' , we mean kan complex .",
    "let @xmath33 be a strict 2-category with all 2-cells invertible ( that is , a category enriched in groupoids ) .",
    "we can define its nerve in two steps .",
    "first we form a simplicial category @xmath34 with @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "this is a category enriched in kan complexes , and is thus suitable for the coherent nerve construction described in @xcite , giving as our final definition that @xmath37 .",
    "it is worth expanding this definition a little .",
    "we recall the definition of the simplicial categories @xmath38 from @xcite*1.1.5 , and are used to define @xmath39 .",
    "this lets us prove :    an @xmath40-cell in @xmath41 consists of    * an @xmath42-tuple @xmath43 of objects of @xmath33 , * morphisms @xmath44 of @xmath33 for all @xmath45 , * 2-cells @xmath46 of @xmath33 for all @xmath47 ,    such that for any @xmath48 there is an identity on 2-cells : @xmath49    as @xmath50 , a map of simplicial categories @xmath51 certainly distinguishes objects @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath25-simplices of homspaces of @xmath52 correspond to subsets of the interval @xmath53 containing both @xmath54 and @xmath55 , and composition is by disjoint union .",
    "thus they are generated under composition by the minimal subsets @xmath56 .",
    "these give us the morphisms @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath26-simplices of homspaces of @xmath52 correspond to ( the opposites of ) inclusions of pairs of subsets of @xmath53 containing both @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "these are generated by inclusions @xmath57 under horizontal and vertical composition , providing the maps @xmath46 of @xmath33 .",
    "the interchange law for horizontal and vertical composition gives us the specified identity , arising from the agreement of the composite inclusions @xmath58 this identity generates all @xmath0-cells in @xmath52 , under composition .",
    "as @xmath59 is the nerve of a groupoid , a map @xmath52 is uniquely specified by its effect on the 1-skeleton , so there are no further data or identities .",
    "we refer to the identity as the _ compatibility condition _ , and since 2-cells are invertible we can write it graphically : it says that the pasting of the following diagram is the identity 2-cell .",
    "@xmath60\\ar@/^16pt/[rr]_{\\uparrow}\\ar@/_26pt/[rrr]^{\\downarrow}\\ar@/^26pt/[rrr]_{\\uparrow}&x_1\\ar[r]\\ar@/_16pt/[rr]^{\\downarrow}&x_2\\ar[r]&x_3}\\ ] ]    we also get the following basic coherence result , which is obvious from the description above .    a lax functor @xmath61 between bicategories with all 2-cells invertible yields ( via passing to strict 2-categories ) a map of quasicategories @xmath62 between their nerves .",
    "we can replace @xmath63 with an equivalent functor of strict 2-categories , and then use the naturality of the nerve construction considered above .",
    "also , this construction agrees with the construction of the nerve of a category .",
    "let @xmath33 be a category , regarded as a bicategory with only identities for 2-cells",
    ". then @xmath64 is the ordinary nerve of @xmath33 .",
    "now , the nerve @xmath64 should be thought of as a model for @xmath33 in the world of quasicategories .",
    "thus , we should expect it to be a ( 2,1)-category in the sense discussed above .",
    "this means that all all extensions of maps @xmath65 to @xmath66-cells are unique for @xmath67 : its cells in degrees 3 and over are determined by those in lower degrees .",
    "the facts support our intuition :    [ nerves - of - bicats ] the nerve @xmath64 is a @xmath32-category .",
    "suppose given an inner horn inclusion @xmath68 for @xmath67 , and @xmath69 .",
    "we can recover all the 1-cells from this data : the 1-cell @xmath70 for @xmath45 will be given by the face numbered @xmath71 for any @xmath72 .    if @xmath73 , then without loss of generality , @xmath74 ( as the case @xmath75 is dealt with in a symmetric manner ) .",
    "we then have the following diagram : @xmath60\\ar@/^16pt/[rr]_{\\uparrow}\\ar@/_26pt/[rrr]^{\\downarrow}&x_1\\ar[r]\\ar@/_16pt/[rr]^{\\downarrow}&x_2\\ar[r]&x_3}\\ ] ] this leaves us just missing the 2-cell @xmath76 .",
    "but , since all 2-cells are invertible , we can take this to be the composite of all the 2-cells in the diagram above . in symbols ,",
    "we define @xmath77 and this clearly fulfils the compatibility condition .",
    "this choice is clearly forced , arising as it does by solving the compatibility condition for @xmath78 , and this means the extension is unique .",
    "if @xmath79 , then all 2-cells are determined uniquely ( indeed , @xmath80 will be defined by face @xmath71 , for any @xmath81 ) . however , if @xmath82 there are some compatibility conditions which are not forced by the faces , and we must check that they hold .    for calculations , we omit the identity parts of our 2-cells . then all composites are vertical composites , so we do not bother writing the @xmath83 .",
    "there are five compatibility conditions coming from the faces : @xmath84 also , @xmath85 and @xmath86 commute .",
    "we can see this using the interchange law : @xmath87    for horn inclusions @xmath88 , we have all coherence conditions except the one arising from face 1 , and must show that from the others .",
    "but we have : @xmath89    for horn inclusions @xmath90 , we have all coherence conditions except the one from face 2 .",
    "similarly , we have : @xmath91    horn inclusions @xmath92 can be dealt with by an argument symmetric to that used for horn inclusions @xmath93 .",
    "the fact that all structure is determined means that the extension is unique .    if @xmath94 , then nothing need be checked : the compatibility conditions on @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 will be fulfilled by face @xmath71 , for any @xmath99 .    using this nerve construction , in the sequel we shall abuse terminology systematically , and confuse a strict 2-category with its nerve , a @xmath32-category .      in this section",
    "we prove some properties of lurie s model for @xmath100-categories , from @xcite*subsection 2.3.4 : these are those @xmath101-categories which admit all inner horn extensions @xmath102 uniquely where @xmath103 .",
    "it follows immediately from the definition @xcite*2.3.4.9 that an @xmath100-category has at most one extension along @xmath104 for @xmath103 ; here s a strengthening of that statement :    [ partial - delta - n - cat ] an @xmath100-category @xmath33 has unique liftings for @xmath104 where @xmath105 .",
    "we can restrict the map @xmath106 to a map @xmath107 , and lift that uniquely to a map @xmath108 .",
    "this is the only candidate for a lifting ; we must prove that it is compatible with the given map on all of @xmath109 : that is , show that it agrees on the first face .",
    "but these two @xmath110-cells certainly agree on the boundary of the first face ( which is isomorphic to @xmath111 ) and thus agree .    in a similar vein",
    "is this :    [ outer - horn - n - cat ] an @xmath100-category @xmath33 has unique liftings for outer horns @xmath112 and @xmath113 where @xmath114 .",
    "we can uniquely extend a map @xmath115 to a map @xmath106 using proposition [ partial - delta - n - cat ] on the @xmath25th face . then we can uniquely extend that to a map @xmath108 using proposition [ partial - delta - n - cat ] again .",
    "the case of @xmath116 is symmetrical .",
    "the special case of ordinary categories will be of utility later :    [ nerve - outer - horns ] the nerve of a category @xmath117 has unique liftings for outer horns @xmath118 and @xmath119 whenever @xmath79 .    the following proposition reduces the work necessary to show that a map of @xmath100-categories is an acyclic kan fibration :    [ acyclic - kan ] a functor @xmath120 of @xmath100-categories automatically has the right lifting property with respect to the maps @xmath104 for @xmath105 .",
    "proposition [ partial - delta - n - cat ] gives a map @xmath108 , and by @xcite*2.3.4.9 , this is consistent with the given map @xmath121 .",
    "we can say useful things about inner fibrations .",
    "let @xmath61 be a functor between @xmath100-categories .",
    "we have the following simple criterion for being an inner fibration :    [ inner - fibs ] the functor @xmath63 is an inner fibration if and only if it has the right lifting property for inner horns @xmath122 for @xmath123 .",
    "in particular , this gives the following simple criterion for @xmath32-categories : @xmath63 is an inner fibration if , for every pair of diagrams @xmath124^h&\\\\            x\\ar[ur]^f&&z } } \\text{in $ { \\mathcal{c}}$,\\hskip 1 cm and } \\vcenter { \\xymatrix{&y'\\ar[dr]^{h'}{\\ar@{=>}}^{k'}[d]&\\\\            x'\\ar[ur]^{f'}\\ar[rr]_{g'}&&z ' } } \\text{in $ { \\mathcal{d}}$,}\\ ] ] such that @xmath125 and @xmath126 , there is a 1-cell @xmath127 and 2-cell @xmath128 such that @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "we now switch our attention to the more intricate notion of a cartesian fibration .",
    "these are analogues of the classical notion of a grothendieck fibration of categories .",
    "they are morphisms of simplicial sets which describe a family of quasicategories varying in a contravariant functorial manner over a base quasicategory . following lurie @xcite",
    ", we make the following definition :    [ defn - cartesian - fibration ] a _ cartesian fibration _",
    "@xmath131 of quasicategories is a functor which is both an inner fibration and is such that , for every 1-morphism @xmath132 ( meaning a 1-cell @xmath133 with @xmath134 and @xmath135 ) and every lift @xmath136 of @xmath137 to @xmath33 ( meaning an 0-cell @xmath138 with @xmath139 ) , there is a @xmath140-cartesian morphism @xmath141 in @xmath33 which maps to @xmath142 under @xmath140 .    in turn ,",
    "a _ @xmath140-cartesian morphism _",
    "@xmath143 is one such that the natural map @xmath144 where @xmath145 , is an acyclic kan fibration .",
    "there is a dual notion of a _",
    "cocartesian morphism _ and a _ cocartesian fibration _ :",
    "a cocartesian fibration describes a family of quasicategories varying covariantly functorially over a base quasicategory .",
    "given @xmath131 , a cocartesian morphism in @xmath33 is a cartesian morphism for @xmath146 , and @xmath140 is a cocartesian fibration if @xmath147 is a cartesian fibration .",
    "lurie proves that overcategories of @xmath100-categories are @xmath100-categories @xcite*lemma 1.2.17.10 . the class of @xmath100-categories is not closed under fibre products . but",
    "the following lemma does most of the work for us :    the class of simplicial sets which are the coskeleton of their @xmath66-skeleton is closed under all limits .",
    "the @xmath40-skeleton functor @xmath148 visibly preserves limits , and the @xmath40-coskeleton functor preserves limits since it is right adjoint to @xmath148 .",
    "given this , this category is closed under limits .    indeed , more is true :    for any @xmath149 , the class of simplicial sets with unique liftings for maps @xmath150 is closed under limits .    the class of such simplicial sets is closed under products since a lifting for the product is just the product of liftings of the factors ; we ll verify it for fibre products too .",
    "so if @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 are simplicial sets with unique extensions for the map @xmath150 , then i claim that @xmath154 has unique liftings for it too .",
    "indeed , a map @xmath155 consists of maps @xmath156 whose composites with the maps from @xmath151 and @xmath152 to @xmath153 agree .",
    "these extend uniquely to maps @xmath157 .",
    "their composites with the maps to @xmath153 are both extensions of our map @xmath158 .",
    "but such extensions are unique , and so they agree .",
    "thus these maps assemble to a unique extension @xmath159 .",
    "these combine to prove the following :    let @xmath131 be a map between @xmath100-categories .",
    "a morphism @xmath132 in @xmath160 is @xmath140-cartesian if and only if the morphism @xmath161 has the right lifting property for all maps @xmath162 for @xmath163 .    by the results above ,",
    "both sides are @xmath100-categories ; we thus apply proposition [ acyclic - kan ] to show the higher lifting conditions are automatic .      in this section",
    "we study the relationship between joyal s over construction ( described in @xcite*lemma 1.2.9.2 ) , and limits of simplicial sets .",
    "the result is that taking overcategories commutes with taking limits of simplicial sets , in the following sense :    [ limits - and - overs ] suppose we have an ( ordinary ) finite category @xmath164 , to be thought of as a diagram category , and a diagram @xmath165 .",
    "suppose also that we have a cone on it : a simplicial set @xmath166 and a natural transformation @xmath167 to @xmath63 from the constant functor at @xmath166 .",
    "we then get a map @xmath168 from @xmath166 to the limit of the diagram @xmath63 .",
    "we then have that the over construction commutes with limits in the sense that @xmath169    we consider maps from a fixed simplicial set @xmath152 ; it s then just a straightforward check : @xmath170    we continue this analysis to derive a corresponding result for finite products and cartesian morphisms :    [ prods - and - carts ] if @xmath171 and @xmath172 are maps of quasicategories , then , defining @xmath173 , the @xmath174-cartesian morphisms ( as defined in subsection [ defn - cartesian - fibration ] ) are exactly the products of @xmath175-cartesian morphisms and @xmath176-cartesian morphisms",
    ".    we must relate a pullback of overcategories of products to a product of pullbacks of overcategories .",
    "the pullbacks and products commute , as usual ; proposition [ limits - and - overs ] provides that the formation of products and of overcategories commute .",
    "lastly , we provide a handy alternative description of overcategories . given a quasicategory @xmath33 , consider the map @xmath177 induced by evaluation of the terminal vertex of @xmath178 .",
    "[ alternative - overcat ] the fibres @xmath179 of @xmath140 are equivalent to @xmath180 .",
    "maps @xmath181 are maps @xmath182 sending @xmath183 to @xmath184 , or equivalently are maps @xmath185 pointed at @xmath184 .",
    "but there is a map @xmath186 , so there is a map @xmath187 .    moreover , since this map @xmath186 is a strong deformation retract .",
    "we immediately get equivalences of homspaces .",
    "the required result then follows from the equivalence of simplicial categories and quasicategories .      in this section ,",
    "we show how quasicategorical limits in undercategories are related to limits in the original quasicategory .",
    "[ forgetting - from - undercat - preserves - limits ] let @xmath33 be any quasicategory with limits , and let @xmath188 be any diagram in it . the `` forgetful '' map @xmath189 preserves limits .",
    "suppose we have a diagram of shape @xmath166 in @xmath190 .",
    "postcomposition with the forgetful map gives a diagram @xmath191 , which admits a limit @xmath192 ; and the map @xmath193 is acyclic kan .",
    "our diagram @xmath194 is equivalent to a diagram @xmath195 . by the acyclic kan condition , this gives us a map @xmath196 , or equivalently , @xmath197 .",
    "we must merely show that this is indeed a limit : that @xmath198 is acyclic kan .",
    "however , given @xmath199 a cofibration , there is a bijective correspondence between squares of the two following sorts : @xmath200\\ar[r]&j\\ar[d]\\\\             { \\mathcal{c}}_{d//(1\\star k)}\\ar[r]&{\\mathcal{c}}_{d//k } } \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad   \\xymatrix{d\\star i\\ar[d]\\ar[r]&d\\star j\\ar[d]\\\\             { \\mathcal{c}}_{/(1\\star k)}\\ar[r]&{\\mathcal{c}}_{/k}}.\\ ] ] since @xmath193 is acyclic kan , we have a diagonal filler on the right , which gives us one on the left , too .    by a straightforward dualisation ,",
    "of course we also get :    [ forgetting - from - overcat - preserves - colimits ] let @xmath33 be any quasicategory and @xmath188 any diagram in it .",
    "then the forgetful map @xmath201 preserves colimits .",

    "this subsection serves two purposes .",
    "firstly , it gives a straightforward construction of homotopy pullbacks in @xmath23 .",
    "then it gives a couple of basic properties of colimits in the quasicategory of spaces ; they are both recognisable results in the discrete case , where they reduce to results about ordinary colimits in the ordinary category of sets .",

    "intrinsic in this machinery is the ability to take the free theory on some fairly general collection of data , but we apply it only to take the free theory on a diagram consisting of other theories . thus we anticipate that the methods introduced here could be used to prove other theorems of this general character .",
    "[ theories - complete ] the quasicategory of theories is complete .    an @xmath231-shaped diagram in theories yields an underlying diagram @xmath415 .",
    "we consider also the functors from the initial theory @xmath340 ; for each @xmath54 , we write @xmath416 for the map @xmath417 .",
    "this is classified by a cartesian fibration @xmath418 .",
    "lurie s model , which we recall from @xcite*3.3.3 , for the limit of this diagram ( in @xmath261 ) is the quasicategory of cartesian sections @xmath419 ( that is , the quasicategory of sections which take 1-cells to cartesian 1-cells ) .",
    "we consider the full subquasicategory of this on the objects @xmath420 for which there is a finite set @xmath320 such that @xmath421 , that is , those which act diagonally on objects .",
    "any cone over @xmath63 in @xmath260 acts diagonally on the objects , up to equivalence , since the maps commute with the structure maps .",

    "now we turn our attention to showing that theories have all colimits .",
    "this will require some technical work , and we build up to the proof slowly .",
    "the plan is as follows : lurie has proved that the quasicategory of quasicategories is cocomplete .",
    "thus , for any simplicial set @xmath164 , the colimit @xmath422 of a diagram in theories factors uniquely through the colimit @xmath423 in the quasicategory of quasicategories .",
    "indeed , we should expect it to be the universal quasicategory with a functor from @xmath423 such that the images of all the product cones in elements of @xmath164 are product cones .",

    "we are interested in the full subcategory @xmath426 with objects the quasicategorical limit cones @xmath427 .",
    "our first step is this :    [ inclusion - of - limits - into - cones ] the inclusion functor @xmath428 preserves all limits .    by @xcite*4.4.2.6 , it suffices to show it preserves all products and pullbacks .    in this proof",
    "we write @xmath429 for the terminal simplicial set , to avoid overuse of the symbol @xmath26 .",

    "note that @xmath261 is a presentable category @xcite*remark 1.2.11 , and @xcite*5.5.3.11 shows that undercategories of presentable categories are presentable .",
    "thus all the categories in the diagram are presentable .",
    "also , the proof of proposition [ inclusion - of - limits - into - cones ] demonstrates that colimits in @xmath442 and @xmath424 are computed in @xmath261 , and thus ( using that the diagonal map is an equivalence ) all three functors preserve colimits .",
    "accordingly , we can apply lurie s adjoint functor theorem @xcite*5.5.2.9 to show the following :    [ forcing - a - limit ] the functor @xmath443 admits a left and a right adjoint .",
    "a straightforward consequence of the existence of a left adjoint is that , for every quasicategory @xmath33 and map @xmath444 , there is a universal quasicategory @xmath445 such that the composite @xmath446 is a limit cone , in the sense that @xmath447 is acyclic kan .",

    "firstly , we can obtain from our diagram @xmath63 a diagram @xmath453 , sending @xmath26 to the initial theory @xmath340 .",
    "we take the colimit of that , using @xcite*3.3.4 .",
    "we claim that the resulting colimit cocone has essentially surjective structure maps .    indeed ,",
    "any object in @xmath454 is in the essential image of @xmath455 for some @xmath456 : the structure maps are jointly essentially surjective .",
    "( to prove this , it is quick to verify that the essential image of @xmath457 in @xmath454 satisfies the colimit property , and is thus all of it ) .",
    "however , any @xmath458 is the essential image of some @xmath459 .",
    "also , there is an equivalence ( induced by the image of the 2-cell @xmath460 in @xmath261 ) between the image of @xmath244 and the image of @xmath320 in @xmath454 .",
    "so every structure map has the same essential .",
    "we start with @xmath461 .",
    "we can transfinitely enumerate the finite product diagrams in the quasicategory @xmath340 as @xmath462 for some ordinal @xmath463 , where @xmath464 is a discrete simplicial set , and @xmath465 .",
    "we choose to do this with redundancy : we want each individual product diagram to appear infinitely many times and be cofinal in @xmath463",
    ". one straightforward way to ensure this is to enumerate them without repetition with ordertype @xmath466 , then take @xmath467 and repeat our list @xmath468-many times .",
    "our aim is to produce @xmath469 by starting from @xmath470 and extending all the maps @xmath471 to limit cones .",
    "proposition [ forcing - a - limit ] supplies us with a quasicategory @xmath472 and a unit map @xmath348 such that the composite @xmath473 is a limit cone .",
    "similarly , we produce @xmath474 from @xmath472 by using the adjunction to provide a quasicategory from which the map from @xmath475 is a limit cone",
    ". then we proceed by transfinite induction , extending to limit ordinals by taking the filtered colimits ( in @xmath261 ) of the preceding quasicategories : @xmath476    the resulting quasicategory @xmath477 is our colimit .",
    "we have several checks to make to show this to be the case .",
    "firstly , it is necessary to show we havent enlarged our quasicategory in an unacceptable manner :    all the structure maps @xmath478 for @xmath479 are essentially surjective .    of claim it suffices to show both that the successor maps @xmath480 are essentially surjective , and also that a colimit of shape @xmath468 of essentially surjective maps is essentially surjective .    a similar argument works for both .",
    "we can show for each that a failure to be essentially surjective would violate the universal property : that the image of the morphism would provide a smaller object with the same property .    indeed ,",
    "if @xmath480 was not essentially surjective , the image @xmath481 would result in the nontrivial factorisation @xmath482 and the left - hand map can easily be checked to be a product cone .",
    "this contradicts the universal property of the adjunction .",
    "similarly , if a colimit @xmath483 of essentially surjective maps of quasicategories is not essentially surjective , then the essential image factors the structure maps of the colimit nontrivially , which contradicts the universal property of the colimit .",
    "secondly , we need to show it is indeed a theory , and that the structure maps we ve defined are maps of theories .",
    "we ve done essential surjectivity already , so we just need the following :    the defined maps @xmath484 preserve all finite products .    of claim given a limit cone @xmath485",
    ", we must show that the composite @xmath486 is a limit cone too . given a lifting problem for a cofibration @xmath487 as follows : @xmath488\\ar[d]&\\delta^n\\ar[d]{\\ar@{-->}}[dl]\\\\            ( x_\\kappa)_{/(1\\star d)}\\ar[r]&(x_\\kappa)_{/d},}\\ ] ]",
    "we rewrite it as @xmath489\\ar[dr]&\\delta^n\\star 1\\star d{\\ar@{-->}}[d]\\\\            & x_\\kappa.}\\ ] ] since the simplicial set @xmath490 is finite , the map from it to @xmath477 factors through some @xmath491 for which @xmath492 is a product cone ( since , by construction , the set of such ordinals @xmath466 is cofinal in @xmath463 ) .",
    "the required extension exists in that @xmath491 and thus also in @xmath477 .",
    "lastly , of course , we need to verify the universal property of a colimit .    @xmath477 is universal among theories under @xmath63 .    of claim",
    "we need to show that the functor @xmath493 is acyclic kan .",

    "since @xmath470 is the colimit of @xmath63 in @xmath261 , we have a diagram @xmath496 factoring our cone through @xmath470 .",
    "working under @xmath63 , since the maps @xmath497 are product - preserving , we can factorise this successively through the @xmath491 to get an essentially surjective , product - preserving map @xmath498 under @xmath63 as required .",
    "now , in case @xmath336 , we have compatible functors @xmath499 and @xmath500 , with the middle @xmath26 sent to @xmath477 .",
    "equivalently , this is a diagram @xmath501 and we need to extend it to @xmath502 .",
    "since @xmath470 is the colimit of @xmath63 , we can extend this the underlying diagram @xmath503 to a diagram @xmath504 , with the middle @xmath26 sent to @xmath470 . using the universal property of the adjunction and the colimiting property",
    ", we can extend this to a map @xmath505 , where @xmath506 denotes the nerve of the ordinal @xmath507 viewed as a poset ( that is , as the poset of ordinals less than or equal to @xmath463 ) , and where the ordinal @xmath466 is sent to @xmath491 .",
    "the terminal vertex of @xmath506 and the initial vertex of @xmath251 are both sent to @xmath477 . moreover , by construction , they are identical under @xmath63 , and so by construction the edge between them is the identity . restriction to @xmath508 thus gives us the required diagram in @xmath261 ; since all the edges were present already and were morphisms of @xmath260 , this is also a diagram in @xmath260 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "we can do similar things with this method :    [ cinftypp - cocomplete ] the quasicategory @xmath285 of quasicategories with all finite products , and product - preserving functors between them , has colimits .",
    "the proof of the preceding proposition generalises in a straightforward manner . since our diagrams are no longer cones of essentially surjective maps under @xmath340 , we need to consider products in all the diagrams and force their images to all be products ( whereas before it sufficed to consider only those in @xmath340 ) .",
    "we no longer need to ensure essential surjectivity , but we do however need to provide limits for all the new objects introduced .",
    "so we intersperse the operations which force cones to be product cones with operations that adjoin new products for the objects ( using the methods of @xcite*5.3.6 ) .",
    "free models for a theory are shown to exist by proposition [ models - pushforward ] ; this section records a more explicit , less involved construction of free models on finite sets .",

    ", we have a natural equivalence @xmath516 this is a straightforward exercise using the quasicategorical yoneda lemma of @xcite*section 5.1 .",
    "in particular , this agrees with the more general construction of proposition  [ models - pushforward ] .",
    "we can also prove :    a theory @xmath22 is equivalent to the opposite of the full subquasicategory of @xmath263 on the free models on finite sets .",
    "the yoneda embedding used above is full and faithful ; and the functor is evidently essentially surjective on objects .",
