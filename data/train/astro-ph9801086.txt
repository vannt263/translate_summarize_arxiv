    "the strong tendency for the circumnuclear emission - line and radio morphologies to be aligned in seyfert galaxies ( e.g.  unger et al .  1987 ; pogge 1988 ; and haniff , wilson & ward 1988 ) added weight to the idea that the ionizing radiation escapes preferentially from the active nucleus along the radio axis . when some of these structures were revealed to be well - defined cones by virtue of the improved resolution offered by the hubble space telescope ( hst ; e.g.  ngc  1068 , evans et al .  1991 ;",
    "ngc  5728 , wilson et al .  1993 ;",
    "ngc  5643 , simpson et al.1997 ) , such anisotropic escape of ionizing photons was confirmed .",
    "this effect is most popularly explained by the presence of an optically thick ` obscuring torus ' ( antonucci 1993 ) , which is able to collimate the intrinsically isotropic ionizing radiation ( see , e.g. , storchi - bergmann , mulchaey & wilson 1993 ) .",
    "in addition , a number of galaxies display the ` ionization cone ' morphology when an excitation map is made , e.g.  in [ ] /(h@xmath1 + [ ] ) .",
    "the close connection between the radio ejecta of seyfert nuclei and their narrow line regions ( nlrs ) initially became apparent from their similar spatial extents and from strong correlations between radio luminosities and [ ] @xmath05007 luminosity and line width ( de bruyn & wilson 1978 ; wilson & willis 1980 ; whittle 1985 , 1992 ) .",
    "spectroscopic studies of the nlr ( baldwin , wilson & whittle 1987 ; whittle et al .",
    "1988 ) , have revealed that the kinematics of the gas are often clearly affected by the radio jets .",
    "such interactions could play a role in determining the structure of the nlr within the region ionized by the nucleus . in a handful of cases ,",
    "hst has shown a clear spatial correspondence between the radio and emission - line distributions ( e.g.  ngc  5929 , bower et al .",
    "1994 ; mrk  78 , capetti et al .  1994 , 1996 ;",
    "mrk  1066 , bower et al .  1995 ;",
    "mrk  3 , capetti et al.1996 ; eso  428g14 , falcke et al .",
    "1996b ) , indicating that the radio ejecta strongly perturb the ionized gas , at least in these objects .",
    "it has also been suggested that the hot gas associated with the shocks generated by the interaction between the radio ejecta and the ambient medium is a significant source of ionizing radiation ( e.g.  dopita 1995 ; dopita & sutherland 1995 ; bicknell et al .",
    "1997 ; see also reviews in morse , raymond , & wilson 1996 and wilson 1996 ) .",
    "it is therefore of great importance to study more seyfert galaxies at the high spatial resolution which only hst can provide , to determine whether the morphology of the narrow line region is determined by the nuclear ionizing radiation or by the interaction of radio jets with the interstellar medium , or by a combination of both . in this paper",
    "we present images taken with the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) of seven seyfert  2 galaxies , selected on the basis of possessing either extended emission - line regions ( as seen in ground - based images ) or broad lines in polarized light .",
    "for each galaxy we have images in the light of the [ ]  @xmath05007 line and the h@xmath1 + [ ]  @xmath36548,6583 blend , as well as in adjacent continua .",
    "we also present new radio maps taken with the very large array ( vla ) , almost all in ` a - configuration ' , providing an angular resolution comparable with that of the hst images . taken together , these allow us to compare directly the structures of the line - emitting gas and radio plasma on scales of tens of parsecs .",
    "we give the details of our observations in section  2 .",
    "the results are presented on a galaxy by galaxy basis in section  3 , while in section  4 we discuss these results and their implications for the role of the radio jets in shaping the narrow line region .",
    "some concluding remarks are given in section  5 . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt a hubble constant @xmath4kms@xmath5mpc@xmath5 .",
    "all galaxies in our sample were observed with the wfpc2 on board the hst . except for observations of h@xmath1 + [ ] and the red continuum of eso  428@xmath2g14 , we used the linear - ramp - filters ( lrfs ) of the wfpc2 , which have position - dependent wavelengths of peak transmission , to image objects in their redshifted emission lines and their adjacent continua .",
    "this means that in order to observe a galaxy at a specific wavelength with the lrfs , the object had to be placed at a specific position within the field of view ( fov ) of the wfpc2 . in most cases",
    "the image will therefore not be taken with the planetary camera ( pc ) but rather with one of the three chips of the wide field camera ( wf ) .",
    "the former has a higher resolution with 00455/pixel while the latter have 01/pixel .",
    "the transmissions and passbands of the lrfs are also position - dependent ; the transmission ranges between 40% and 80% and the passband is @xmath6 , with a roughly triangular transmission profile .",
    "the passband and the run of the central wavelength with position translate into an upper limit of 14for the size of an emission - line region that can be imaged with the lrfs .    for our observations",
    "the filters and central wavelengths were chosen such that they were centered on the redshifted h@xmath1 ( @xmath06563 ) and [ ] @xmath7 ( hereafter referred to simply as [ ] ) emission - lines and their adjacent continua , all observations being split into two integrations to allow cosmic ray rejection . due to the relatively large filter width ,",
    "the [ ] @xmath8 contribution to the h@xmath1 images is significant ( typically between a third and one half ) , depending on the local [ ] /h@xmath1-ratio and the position on the chip .",
    "the details of the observations are given in table  1 .",
    "all exposures were bias- and dark - subtracted by the wfpc2 pipeline processing at the space telescope science institute .",
    "since flatfields were not available for the lrfs , we used flatfields taken in nearby narrow - band filters ( f502n and f673n ) .",
    "the exposures were then combined to remove cosmic rays and corrected for geometric distortions , since line- and continuum images were in general taken at different positions on the chip .",
    "the images were then rotated to the cardinal orientation ( north up , and east to the left ) .",

    "the red continuum was chosen because it generally has a higher signal - to - noise ratio and we did not find significant offsets between the green and the red peaks .",

    "the emission - line structure we find in this galaxy is the most compact in our whole sample .",
    "the emission is dominated by a single central peak ( fig .",

    "hence , we composed an average psf from 5 stars which were visible in the fov of our h@xmath1 + [ ] image of mrk  1210 and which had more than 1000 counts .",
    "the stars were shifted onto a common center , scaled and weighted according to their peak flux , and then co - added . finally , we subtracted this average psf image from the continuum - subtracted , but not rotated , h@xmath1 + [ ] image of mrk  1210 until the central pixel had the average flux value of its neighbors . the result",

    "some of the structure visible may , however , still reflect uncertainties in the psf . if we divide the [ ] by the h@xmath1 + [ ] image ( without psf subtraction ) , we find , an unusually high [ ] -to - h@xmath1 + [ ] ratio of 5 for the central peak while the faint extended emission has [ ] /(h@xmath1+[])@xmath36 ( determined in the region not dominated by the instrumental ` spider ' structure of the central peak ) .    not surprisingly , the radio structure is also very compact , but is slightly resolved ( fig .  [ f7 ] ) .",
    "we find a total , integrated flux of 39 mjy at 3.5 cm ( 31.4 mjy peak ) , which is consistent with earlier observations by antonucci & barvainis ( priv .",

    "finally , we note that if the slight elongation to the se visible in the psf subtracted h@xmath1 + [ ] image ( but see remarks above ) and possibly also in the radio map is real , then this direction would be roughly perpendicular to the optical polarization vector ( pa=29@xmath24 ) as measured by tran ( 1995 )",

    "1988 ) and vla radio observations ( ulvestad & wilson 1984 ) , it is known that this galaxy has an extended structure with two emission - line and radio lobes .",

    "[ f8 ] and [ f12 ] ) .",
    "the overall morphology is very straight along pa=@xmath227 with some small wiggles in the jet .",
    "this structure is unlike radio galaxies , since mrk  34 not only has two pronounced hotspots , like luminous frii radio galaxies , but also well defined , two - sided jets , as in low - luminosity fri radio galaxies .",
    "the spectral indices we find for the jet from our x- and c - band data are extremely steep .",
    "the nuclear region has @xmath42 and the nw hotspot @xmath43 , while the spectrum of the se hotspot is even steeper with @xmath44 .",
    "however , these numbers should be treated with caution , as resolution effects tend to steepen spectra taken in a single vla configuration .",
    "since the astrometric positions ( table  3 ) indicate that the brightest peak in the jet is very close to the optical nucleus , we have aligned those two peaks .",
    "the emission - line structure then aligns very closely with the radio structure , so the ionized gas is physically associated with the radio jet ( fig .",

    "remarkably , the two radio hotspots coincide with pronounced regions of low excitation ( figs .",
    "[ f10 ] and [ f12 ] ; see also fig .",

    "the nlr structure is elongated and diffuse with a strong central peak near the continuum peak and an overall structure resembling mrk  348 .",
    "the excitation map is more difficult to interpret since there is no clear ionization cone visible , and the emission - line distribution in the north is partly obscured by the dust lanes .",
    "it might be said that the distribution of excitation to the south is consistent with a ragged ionization cone .",
    "the vla map of ngc  7212 ( fig .  [ f8 ] ) shows a compact , double source separated by 07 in the north - south direction , with the northern blob being slightly elongated .",
    "the small angular extent in the radio is another similarity to mrk  348 .    using the astrometry based upon argyle s star in the fov of this galaxy ,",
    "we find that the compact , southern radio blob , is offset by almost 1 to the nw of the optical nucleus ( fig .",
    "[ f13 ] ) .",
    "this is substantially larger than the typical errors in these astrometric observations and either indicates a not yet understood systematic error or is indeed significant .",
    "our new position for the optical nucleus deviates a few tenth of an arcsecond from the position given in clements ( 1983 ) , but the basic result remains the same with both positions , suggesting that the offset is real .",
    "hence , this offset might indicate the presence of a strong dust lane in the nuclear region .",
    "given our new position the southern lobe of ngc  7212 seems to coincide with a low - excitation region ( fig .",
    "[ f13 ] ) , an effect we have already seen in some of the other galaxies in our sample .    in general ,",
    "we confirm the results of tran ( 1995 ) , who suggested that dust obscuration plays a significant role in this source ( see also the broad - band continuum image in fig .  [ f5 ] ) and found a jet extending up to 10  from the nucleus at pa=@xmath47 in ground - based [ ] and h@xmath1 images  exactly the same direction as the axis of the newly found double radio source on a much smaller spatial scale .",
    "as noted by tran ( 1995 ) , this direction is essentially perpendicular to that of the optical polarization ( pa 93@xmath48 ) , suggesting that the obscuring torus plus scattering region model may apply to ngc  7212 .",
    "we have observed a sample of seven seyfert 2 galaxies with hst in the h@xmath1 + [ ] and [ ] emission - lines and with the vla at 3.5 cm and 2 cm to study the morphology of the nlr and its interaction with the radio outflows .",
    "we were able to resolve the nlr in six of the seven galaxies and in all cases found a very elongated emission - line region .",
    "in the four galaxies ( mrk  573 , eso  428@xmath2g14 , mrk  34 , ngc  4388 ) whose nlrs have the largest angular extent we find bi - polar structures in excitation maps , which can be interpreted as either the ` ionization cones ' expected in the unified scheme or widening , self - excited matter outflows . in all cases where an ` ionization cone ' was known from ground - based observations ( mrk  573 , ngc  4388 , and possibly mrk  348 ) , we found an equivalent counterpart on the sub - arcsecond scale with a similar opening angle . this continuation and the straightness of the cone",
    "edges in ngc  4388 and mrk  573 argue in favor of some kind of obscuring ` torus ' with well defined inner edges around the nucleus .",
    "nevertheless , we find substantial structures within those ` cones ' which indicate that , in the nuclear region , additional processes ( such as jet / ism interactions ) , besides anisotropic radiation , have a major impact on the excitation of the gas .",
    "our radio observations have resulted in high quality maps of the galaxies in our sample , most of which show clear evidence for radio - jets and/or lobes .",
    "seyfert galaxies show a considerable diversity in their radio structures with various morphologies : narrow jets ( eso  428@xmath2g14 ) , triple structures with a core and two hotspots ( mrk  573 ) , jets plus two hotspots ( mrk  34 ) , radio plumes and limb - brightened lobes ( ngc  4388 ) , etc .",
    "this diversity suggests that seyfert jets are much more influenced by jet - ism interaction than fri and frii radio galaxies , which may not be surprising since the radio power of seyfert galaxies is orders of magnitudes smaller than in radio galaxies .",
    "the existence of this interaction is in fact well documented by the comparison between the radio continuum and emission - line images ( figs .",
    "[ f12 ] & [ f13 ] ) . in those galaxies with polarized optical light ( e.g.  tran 1995 )",
    "we find that the polarization vector is perpendicular to the axis of the radio structure and the nlr ( mrk  348 , ngc  7212 , and possibly also in mrk  1210 ) .",
    "in several cases we also note that the excitation structure is influenced by the jet , e.g. radio hotspots seem to coincide with regions of reduced excitation ( mrk  573 , mrk  34 , and probably also ngc  4388 and ngc  7212 ) , while high - excitation regions are often found downstream of radio hotspots or regions where the jet bends or comes to an end ( the se end of eso  428@xmath2g14 and the southern hotspot of ngc  4388 ) .",
    "it is quite obvious that there is not only a close correlation between the radio and the emission - line morphologies , but that _ the radio jet - ism interaction is an important effect which strongly influences the excitation and morphology of the nlr_.    for example , the emission - line arcs in mrk  573 wrap around the radio lobes .",
    "our 2 cm maps ( figs .",
    "[ f6 ] and [ f12 ] ) also shows that one of the radio lobes is elongated and bends in the region where the interaction is thought to occur .",
    "further , the reduced excitation ( i.e.   [ ] /(h@xmath1 + [ ] ) ratio ) of the inner emission - line arcs is consistent with a lower ionization parameter which can be understood if the arcs represent gas which has passed through a radiative bow shock , cooled and increased in density .",
    "a similar effect is seen in mrk  34 , in which the radio lobes coincide with a low - excitation region , while the jet itself is surrounded by high - excitation gas .",
    "the wiggles seen in the radio jet of this galaxy could possibly be interpreted as some kind of kelvin - helmholtz instabilities between the radio plasma and the surrounding , ionized gas .",
    "eso  428@xmath2g14 exhibits well - collimated , irregular emission - line strands on one side and a figure `` eight '' morphology on the other .",
    "the latter has been interpreted as two helical emission - line strands wrapping around a radio jet ( falcke et al .",
    "our new , high - resolution maps indeed show a filamentary radio jet which supports this idea : the nw part of the radio jet is straight with the emission - line helix possibly surrounding it , while the se radio jet splits into two at @xmath211(90 pc ) from the nucleus , again with a close relationship to the emission - line strands . however , since there is no possible registration in which the radio jet and the emission - line strands coincide precisely ( there always seems to be a slight offset between those two structures ) , it seems likely that here too the emission - line gas wraps around the radio - outflow .",
    "another example of an interaction between a radio jet and ambient gas is found in ngc  4388 , where a bright spike is seen in the ionized gas at the end of the southern jet , while the radio plasma to the north flows apparently unhampered out of the galaxy disk and forms a large ( @xmath9 1 kpc ) radio plume .",
    "our 3.5 cm map also indicates that this radio plume may be hollow and hourglass shaped .",
    "this structure is reminiscent of the radio lobe found , for example , in ngc  3079 ( seaquist et al .  1978 ) and a few other galaxies ( ford et al . 1986 ) .",
    "this kind of limb - brightened radio lobe stands in marked contrast to the well - collimated , stranded jets in eso  428@xmath2g14 and ngc  4258 ( e.g.  cecil , wilson , & tully 1992 ) .",
    "an important difference is that ngc  3079 and ngc  4388 have jets which escape almost perpendicular to the galaxy plane , while in ngc  4258 and perhaps eso  428g14 the jet appears to be directed into the disk of the galaxy .",
    "the difference in radio morphology may then be ascribed to the much higher external gas density when the jet is in the disk than in the galaxy halo .",
    "moreover , even the sources with compact nlrs support the jet - ism interaction scenario , since all three such sources also have correspondingly compact radio structures .",
    "these sources happen to be those selected for hst observations on the basis of having hidden broad line regions , visible in polarized light , rather than having extended emission - lines in ground - based observations .",
    "the most extreme case of a compact nlr is mrk  1210 , in which the line emission is dominated by a point source ( @xmath49pc ) and which has the highest [ ] /(h@xmath1 + [ ] ) ratio .",
    "hence , the most important conclusion that comes out of this study is not only that an expectation of the unified scheme`ionization cones'is tentatively supported by the hst observations , but also that the influence of radio jets and their angle with respect to the galaxy plane can not be ignored when discussing the structure , kinematics , and excitation of the nlr of seyferts .",
    "specifically , there seems to be a tendency for radio lobes to coincide with lower excitation regions , presumably a result of compression of the ambient gas .    as a consequence of this compression",
    "one would also expect that compact regions with high emission - line brightness ( e.g the inner arcs in mrk 573 ) have high density and thus low [ ] /h@xmath1 + [ ] ratio .",
    "figure [ f14 ] shows diagrams in which we have plotted the emission line brightness versus the [ ] /h@xmath1 + [ ] ratio for each pixel in the four images with the largest number of usable pixels ( i.e. with emission - line brightness above the 3@xmath22 noise level ) .",
    "the upper envelope for all of these graphs has a characteristic peaked shape , indicating that the brightest features have only moderate excitation . in mrk  573 and",
    "ngc  4388 , the highest excitation is clearly found in the lowest brightness regions , as expected if variations in both of these parameters are primarily determined by variations in gas density .",
    "however , no such clear relationship is seen for eso  428g14 and ngc  7212 .",
    "the detailed relation between line brightness and excitation will be influenced by factors additional to density , inlcuding the size of the cloud , the local intensity of the ionizing radiation , abundances , and whether the clouds are matter- or ionization - bounded .",
    "in addition , the inclusion of some of the [ ] @xmath36548,6583 lines in our h@xmath1 images complicates the interpretation of these diagrams .",
    "it is , thus , not surprising that simple correlations are not seen in fig .",
    "[ f14 ] .    finally , it is interesting to consider the jets and nlr of seyfert galaxies in the broader context of agn physics . as pointed out before ,",
    "some of our galaxies ( e.g. mrk  34 and mrk  573 ) have [ ] luminosities comparable to radio - quiet , low - redshift quasars . for such objects , we are discussing a regime in which the quasar and seyfert classifications overlap .",
    "one important feature of quasars is , however , that they come in two classes : radio - loud and radio - quiet .",
    "using the well known [ ] -to - radio correlations ( e.g.  miller , rawlings , & saunders 1993 ; falcke , malkan , & biermann  1995 ; falcke 1996 ) , it is clear that the seyferts in our sample belong to the radio - quiet class of agn , yet they not only show jets , but these jets are also kinematically important for the emission - line gas . the question of whether radio - quiet quasars also have jets has been debated for a while .",
    "kellerman et al .",
    "( 1994 ) found a number of radio - quiet quasars which have a double radio structure and falcke , patnaik , & sherwood ( 1996a ) found evidence for relativistic jets in radio - quiet quasars .",
    "the jets we find in mrk  34 and mrk  573 would in fact resemble some of the double structures seen by kellerman et al .",
    "( 1994 ) if placed at a larger distance and observed with lower sensitivity .",
    "our results have shown that observations of jets and nlrs in seyfert galaxies allow a detailed look into the physics of the circumnuclear regions of agn , with much better linear resolution than is possible for most of the more luminous agn .",
    "further studies of the nlr of seyferts should take account of the fact that seyfert jets leave their trace on the ism .",
    "high ( spatial ) resolution spectroscopy , as it is possible now with stis on - board the hst , should provide quantitative results on the kinematics , excitations , and densities involved in these jet - ism interaction regions and , in this way , give us important information not only on the kinematics of the nlr , but also on the kinematics and dynamics of low - power radio jets .",
    "those observations may also settle the exact nature of the excitation of the nlr .",
    "even though the radio jets substantially influence the nlr , it is still unclear whether the dominant source of ionizing photons is the compact , hidden seyfert 1 nucleus or hot gas created in the jet - driven shocks .",
