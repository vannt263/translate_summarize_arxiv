    "conducting chains have been extensively studied in the past period , due to several reasons .",
    "first , periodic chains holding different type of cells are genuine objects for applications in device design techniques at the level of molecular nanotechnology @xcite . as such",
    ", these systems represent a starting point in creating functional devices , materials and components on a 1 - 100 nanometer length scale which can lead to new routes in realizing functions of practical interest like field effect transistors , electroluminiscent diodes , nanocatalysis , hydrogen storage , etc .",
    "second , several type of periodic conducting chains are in fact organic materials . their nature , besides the fact that potentially allows developments that can lead to condensates on a plastic ( as plastic ferromagnetism for example @xcite ) , has exceptional qualities for new developments in electronics , for example in the direction of organic optoelectronic and field effect transistor components @xcite , high performance transistors and circuits made based on soluble materials @xcite , biodegradable devices used for controlled - release drug delivery inside of the human body @xcite , or electronic components on plastic providing flexible electronics @xcite .",
    "third , conducting chains exhibit quite interesting properties and phases important in advanced technological applications ( as spintronics ) , for example insulating , conducting , half metallic , paramagnetic or ferromagnetic behavior @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these systems have the virtue of having fundamentally different ground states which can be tuned by external parameters like external fields or site selective gate potentials @xcite , opening new routes for the design of valves , switches , or control devices .",
    "finally , the majority of conducting chains being described by non - integrable models , represent genuine challenges to theory and necessitate the development of rigorous techniques to describe the physical properties of these systems .",
    "the chains under consideration are built up in fact from periodic arrangements of rings .",
    "their theoretical study goes back to middle nineties and starts with triangular chains @xcite .",
    "this case attracted attention especially by the study of the emergence possibilities of ferromagnetism in such systems @xcite , analysis of the stability of this phase @xcite , low temperature thermodynamics @xcite , numerical studies in two band cases @xcite , or even study of exact ground states in non - integrable situations @xcite .",
    "the attempts to characterize the physical properties of quadrilateral chains have been started later , being intensified by the study of aharonov - bohm cage properties @xcite , and have led to the description of quite interesting ground state characteristics in the diamond chain case which are tunable by external fields providing for example correlated half metal behavior applicable for spin - valve design @xcite .",
    "the study of chains of pentagons intensified after 2000 , when a. heeger , a. macdiarmid and h. shirakawa obtained the nobel prize in chemistry for the discovery and development of conducting polymers .",
    "the most common representatives of this class of materials are based on polythiophene , polypyrrole and polytriazole , all containing pentagon rings .",
    "the study of the physical properties of these systems has been concentrated on the search for flat band ferromagnetism @xcite , and also the analysis of their ground states in exact terms has been started @xcite .    following the interest in increase in the number of lattice sites in the ring which forms the basis of the periodic chain , one arrives at chains of hexagons which are the subject of this paper .",
    "the hexagon chains are of real interest since are relatively abundant in nature .",
    "the main representative of the zig - zag hexagon chains at the level of organic materials , are the polyacenes .",
    "acenes , or polyacenes are a class of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons made up of linearly fused hexagon rings .",
    "these systems attracted attention because of optoelectronic and electrical engineering application possibilities which have led even to organic field effect transistors in which pentacene is incorporated @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "such chains present potential possibilities for the design of soluble acene - based transistors and circuits @xcite , tetracene and pentacene have been used for the design of light emitting devices @xcite , etc . due to these properties ,",
    "the polyacene structures have been studied extensively ; the theoretical studies have been mostly confined to mean - field type of descriptions @xcite .",
    "one notes that the interest in hexagonal chains and structures is not restricted exclusively to carbon based materials , since also other compounds present similar cell structure , for example boron - nitride ionic honeycomb systems @xcite , etc .",
    "recently , based on first principle calculations , the coulomb interaction has been analyzed in acenes between two particles .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the average coulomb repulsion in these systems can reach values around @xmath1 , the ratio of @xmath2 to the bandwidth @xmath3 being of order @xmath4 .",
    "these results show that correlation effects are very prominent in this type of chains , leading the authors to the conjecture that by increasing the concentration of carriers in these systems , the coulomb repulsion is expected to stabilize correlated magnetic ground states .",
    "the present paper has the aim to analyze this conjecture at a genuine many - body level . in order to treat the correlations properly and create premises for valuable conclusions ,",
    "the study is made here at exact level .",
    "exact results for the chains under consideration , taking into account their quasi 1d character and non - integrable nature , are extremely rare .",
    "one only knows exact ground states for triangle @xcite , and rhombus @xcite cases .",
    "the method used allows the exact ground state to be deduced under general circumstances independent on dimensionality or integrability and it is based on a technique which uses positive semidefinite operator characteristics .",
    "a positive semidefinite operator @xmath5 , is the operator which has the property @xmath6 for all vectors @xmath7 of the hilbert space @xmath8 .",
    "it results that all eigenvalues @xmath9 of @xmath5 , @xmath10 , are non - negative , e.g. @xmath11 . consequently , if one succeeds in finding an exact decomposition of the hamiltonian @xmath12 in terms of positive semidefinite terms , namely @xmath13 , where @xmath14 are positive semidefinite operators ( whose number is @xmath15 ) , and @xmath16 is a constant depending on hamiltonian parameters , then the operator @xmath17 has a positive semidefinite form .",
    "hence , @xmath18 has a spectrum bounded below by a well defined and known number , namely zero . as a result , the exact ground state of @xmath18 ( consequently , also of @xmath12 ) ,",
    "is given by the vector @xmath19 holding the property @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath21 must be satisfied for all @xmath22 .",
    "the technique which we used is based on the above presented properties .",
    "first one has finds an exact decomposition of the hamiltonian of the system in a positive semidefinite form , and obtain the explicit form of the positive semidefinite operators @xmath14 for all @xmath23 . in the second step one constructs the @xmath24 ground state hilbert space vector such to satisfy @xmath25 for all @xmath23 .",
    "this procedure depends on the explicit form of the @xmath14 operators , but one exemplifies below a particular case which will be used for the study of the zig - zag hexagon chain described below .",
    "let us assume that one has for @xmath26 the structure @xmath27 for the positive semidefinite operators @xmath14 , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 are built up from a linear combination of annihilation fermionic operators . in these conditions",
    "the construction of the ground state starts by the construction of the wave vector @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the bare vacuum .",
    "the @xmath32 operators ( constructed from fermionic creation operators ) , are objects which have to be deduced .",
    "their calculation is made based on the anti - commutation relation @xmath33 , which must be satisfied for all values of all indices @xmath23 and @xmath34 .",
    "indeed , if this anti - commutation relation holds , in @xmath35 , the @xmath29 operator can be pushed in front of the vacuum state obtaining @xmath36 , which , given by the annihilation nature of @xmath29 provides @xmath37 .",
    "consequently indeed @xmath38 holds .",
    "the phase factor @xmath39 provides only a @xmath40 , or @xmath41 multiplicative factor depending on the even , or odd number of operators in @xmath42 .",
    "after deducing all possible @xmath32 operators , the ground state @xmath43 is obtained by restricting the index @xmath44 , such to obtain @xmath45 |0\\rangle$ ] based on the condition @xmath46 also for @xmath47 .",
    "the corresponding ground state energy becomes @xmath48 .",
    "the carrier concentration at which @xmath43 is defined , is provided by the number of electrons introduced into the system by the @xmath49 operator product acting on the vacuum state @xmath31 .",
    "one further notes that the transformation of the starting hamiltonian @xmath12 in a positive semidefinite form @xmath50 is not unique , can be performed in several different ways , each transformation places the final result in different regions of the parameter space . the parameter space domain in which the deduced ground state is present , is fixed by the matching conditions .",
    "these last are relations between the @xmath12 parameters and the @xmath14 parameters which allow the transcription of the starting @xmath12 in the used positive semidefinite form .",
    "the detailed presentation of the technique can be found in several recent publications @xcite .",
    "the implementation of this method at finite value of the interaction has been started at the end of nineties @xcite and has proven to be a successful and powerful technique leading to exact results even in situations unexpected in the context of exact solutions as : three dimensions @xcite , disordered and interacting systems in 2d @xcite , emergence of condensates @xcite , stripes and checkerboards in 2d @xcite , or insulator to metal transition driven by the hubbard repulsion in 2d in vicinity of half filling @xcite .",
    "we further note that similar techniques are used for spin models as well @xcite .",
    "one analyzes the problem by concentrating on a fixed and given hexagon chain of zig - zag type ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the zig - zag nature must be accentuated since hexagon cells can be connected in a chain also in another way , namely in armchair configuration .",
    "the starting hamiltonian , besides several hopping matrix elements and on - site one - particle potentials contains also the coulomb repulsion as interaction , but for simplicity only at on - site level , providing the hubbard interaction term with @xmath51 strength .",
    "since we are interested in finding valuable information about electron correlation effects in a fixed confined system , one keeps the chain structure unchanged during the study , e.g. phononic contributions are neglected .",
    "since peierls transitions caused by electron - phonon interactions in chain structures with even number of sites per cell could influence the emerging phases only around half - filling @xcite , one does not expect that the neglected phononic contributions will provide genuine changes in our results relating far from half - filling regions .",
    "the hamiltonian of the starting chain is transformed first in a positive semidefinite form .",
    "this transformation is important not only in the context of acene structures .",
    "this is because several other systems of large interest today are built up from hexagons .",
    "for example graphene , being a 2d hexagon structure constructed from the same cell , can be described at the level of the transformation into a positive semidefinite form by the same block operators as used here for the zig - zag hexagon chain in section iv .",
    "the block operators applied for the transformation were such chosen to provide a not severely restricted phase diagram region where the conclusions are valid .",
    "after this transformation one analyzes the bare band structure and one shows that flat bands are not possible to emerge .",
    "hence , flat band ferromagnetism @xcite ( often studied in the context of conducting chains , see for example @xcite ) is excluded _ a priori _ from the spectrum of possible magnetic phases .",
    "after the positive semidefinite form of the hamiltonian has been obtained , one turns to the construction of the ground states @xmath43 .",
    "this step starts with the deduction of the operators denoted hereafter by @xmath32 , building up @xmath43 .",
    "one notes that the label index @xmath34 has also a spin component .",
    "interestingly , it turns out that all these operators are extended , i.e. have components placed in each cell and can not be introduced in a restricted domain of the chain with extension smaller than the system size in the direction of the primitive vector .",
    "the extended nature of all @xmath32 operators is a special characteristic of the hexagon chains , which has not been observed previously in the case of triangle , quadrilateral and pentagon chains @xcite .",
    "this aspect is important for two reasons .",
    "first , the methods for the treatment and deduction of the extended operators in the context of the positive semidefinite operator technique are practically completely open and unknown . on this line one",
    "notes that even if it has been shown that the treatment in another context of the extended operators is feasible @xcite , one has only one case described quite recently in the literature , namely in the study of the insulator to metal transition driven by the hubbard repulsion in 2d in the vicinity of half filling @xcite .",
    "since a strategy developed for 2d , directly can not be applied for quasi 1d structures , at this point a special technique has been constructed and described for the deduction of the @xmath32 operators , which can be used for other chain structures as well .",
    "second , the extended nature of @xmath32 terms is present in a confined space region delimited by the chain itself .",
    "consequently , by increasing the carrier concentration ( i.e. increasing the number of independent @xmath32 operators in @xmath43 ) , the @xmath32 operators present in the ground state wave vector will satisfy connectivity conditions ( i.e. will act on common lattice sites ) .",
    "given by this , the spin indices of the electrons must be correlated in order to avoid as much as possible the double occupancy and to reduce in this manner the ground state energy .",
    "this is the route for the emergence of ferromagnetism in these systems .",
    "the obtained results show that the conjecture by brocks et al .",
    "@xcite made at two - particle level for acenes is indeed viable in a rigorous many - body frame provided by a fixed zig - zag hexagon chain described by a hubbard type of model .",
    "the remaining part of the paper is structured as follows : section ii .",
    "describes in detail the system of interest and its hamiltonian , section iii . analyzes the non - interacting band structure , section iv . presents the transformation of the hamiltonian in a positive semidefinite form , section v. solves the matching conditions , section vi . presents the deduction strategy for the exact ground states , and the obtained ground states together with their physical properties , and section vii . containing the summary and conclusions closes the presentation .",
    "the appendix contains mathematical details related to the exemplification in a simple case of the deduced ground states .",
    "the zig - zag hexagon chain is presented in fig.1 . in the cell constructed at the site @xmath52 one",
    "has 4 lattice sites whose position relative to the site @xmath52 is given by the vectors @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",

    "ii ) one chooses from all the possible @xmath182 operators those @xmath183 , @xmath184 , which satisfy also @xmath185 .",
    "one considers the @xmath32 operators as the most general linear combination of creation operators with fixed spin projection acting on each lattice site of the system .",
    "consequently , besides a fixed @xmath186 index , also the spin projection @xmath69 will be explicitly used as a label , and one has @xmath187 where the site @xmath68 runs over all lattice sites of the sublattice @xmath188 , and the @xmath189 coefficients represent the unknown variables which must be deduced . the placement of the coefficients @xmath189 is presented in fig.7 .    now using ( [ e15],[e19 ] ) in ( [ e17 ] ) , one finds the following linear equations for the @xmath189 coefficients from ( [ e19 ] ) defined for the cell constructed at the site @xmath190 @xmath191 where the notation @xmath192 has been introduced . from ( [ e20 ] )",
    "one finds @xmath193 the equations from ( [ e21 ] ) can be written in a matrix form as @xmath194 where @xmath195 is a column vector with 4 components , which taken in order are given by @xmath196 .",
    "similarly , @xmath197 is the column vector with elements @xmath198 @xmath199    finally , the @xmath200 matrix @xmath201 is defined by    @xmath202    starting from ( [ e24 ] ) , in the following subsection one shows how it is possible to construct one ( starting ) @xmath203 operator .",
    "based on ( [ e22 ] ) one finds @xmath205 consequently , since periodic boundary conditions are taken into account ( i.e. after a finite number of @xmath15 steps , in @xmath206 one must recovers @xmath195 ) , an operator @xmath203 from ( [ e19 ] ) , proper for the construction of the ground state , is obtained when the matrix @xmath207 has at least one eigenvalue @xmath208 . in this case the @xmath209 unknown parameters from ( [ e19 ] ) are given exactly by the corresponding @xmath210 eigenvector @xmath211 one finds in this manner the starting coefficients @xmath209 in the form @xmath212 for the next @xmath213 cells @xmath214 , the coefficients @xmath215 are obtained by successive application of the @xmath201 matrix to @xmath210 as follows : @xmath216 are obtained from @xmath217 deduced as @xmath218 ; @xmath219 are obtained from @xmath220 deduced as @xmath221 ; etc . ; @xmath222 are obtained from @xmath223 deduced as @xmath224 .",
    "given by ( [ e26 ] ) , for the coefficients @xmath225 entering in @xmath226 , the values @xmath227 are reobtained .",
    "after this step , starting from the coefficients @xmath228 present in @xmath229 , the expressions are periodically repeated since @xmath230 holds again . in this manner",
    "a @xmath203 operator has been constructed for a system characterized by @xmath231 , where @xmath232 is an arbitrary positive integer .",
    "once a @xmath203 operator has been deduced following the procedure described above , one has a proper operator for the construction of the ground state that has the obtained @xmath209 coefficients structure holding a periodicity of @xmath15 @xmath234 cells , the starting cell being the @xmath68th cell @xmath195 .",
    "if one moves the starting cell to the @xmath235 cell , one obtains a new , ( usually ) linearly independent @xmath236 operator . repeating the procedure , starting from @xmath203 , maximum @xmath213 new operators @xmath237 , @xmath238 can be created ( the linear independence must be checked at each step ) .",
    "if more than one unity eigenvalues are present , the procedure can be repeated for each eigenvalue , constructing in this manner for the fixed @xmath15 periodicity , maximum @xmath239 different @xmath0 operators , where @xmath240 represents the number of unity eigenvalues corresponding to eigenvectors with non - zero norm .",
    "an exemplification is presented in the appendix .",
    "the procedure can then be repeated for another @xmath15 .      using the operators deduced above",
    ", the @xmath241 wave vector described below ( [ e17 ] ) has the form @xmath242 one notes that the @xmath0 operators ( given by ( [ e22 ] ) ) are all extended operators . hence increasing the number of carriers and taking into account that all @xmath0 operators are confined in the same quasi 1d structure",
    ", it results that connectivity conditions will be satisfied between different @xmath0 operators with different @xmath34 indices ( e.g. @xmath243 and @xmath244 operators for @xmath245 will touch each other , hence will act on a given finite number of common sites ) . for the example provided in the appendix a. this happens starting from the @xmath246 number of particles .",
    "consequently , in order to minimize the ground state energy , all @xmath69 indices in ( [ e28 ] ) will be fixed to the same value ( @xmath247 for all @xmath248 ) providing in this manner zero double occupancy , hence a ferromagnetic ground state of the form @xmath249 where @xmath69 is fixed .",
    "indeed @xmath43 from ( [ e29 ] ) , as constructed from ( [ e28 ] ) , will satisfy @xmath250 for the first part of the transformed hamiltonian from ( [ e3 ] ) , while @xmath251 will be given by the absence of the double occupancy .",
    "consequently , @xmath43 represents the ground state of @xmath12 from ( [ e3 ] ) , the ground state energy being @xmath252 , where @xmath170 is given in ( [ e13 ] ) .",
    "since one @xmath0 operator introduces in fact one particle into the system , the particle number ( hence the concentration of carriers ) at which @xmath43 in ( [ e29 ] ) is defined , is given by the number of components of the product from ( [ e29 ] ) .",
    "as described , @xmath43 represents a ferromagnetic state .",
    "this ground state is itinerant and metallic because of the following reasons : i ) the ground state wave function is extended , and ii ) up to the @xmath253 value equal to the number of components of the product from ( [ e29 ] ) , one has for the particle number ( @xmath254 ) dependent chemical potential @xmath255 , the expression @xmath256 where @xmath257 and @xmath258 , see also ref.[@xcite ] .",
    "our up to date results show that the ferromagnetism emerges in the low concentration domain , a pedagogical example being presented in appendix a. if one characterizes the carrier concentration by @xmath259 ( i.e. average electron number per cell ) , the exemplified case in appendix a. of six explicitly given operators describing through ( [ e29 ] ) six interacting electrons , even for a chain made of 36 cells ( for example ) gives @xmath260 , a far from zero finite concentration value .",
    "consequently , the reported results clearly demonstrate the presence of itinerant ferromagnetism in the systems under study at low concentration , for finite chains ( treated with periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "since 36 cells is a huge number for oligo - acenes ( i.e. _ few _ linearly fused hexagons ) placed in the center of the attention @xcite , our findings represent genuine information for potential application possibilities .",
    "furthermore , one underlines that since ( as shown in sec.iii . )",
    "flat bands are not present in the system , the here described ferromagnetism is not of flat band type , and is provided by a joint effect of correlation and confinement .",
    "one notes that for the finite sample case explicitly exemplified in appendix a , the hubbard repulsion must satisfy only the @xmath51 condition , the @xmath261 value itself being without importance .",
    "the phase diagram region where the presented solution occurs is not severely restricted .",
    "besides two sign requirements present for two hopping matrix elements ( @xmath262 ) , only one condition for on - site one - particle potentials is present ( see ( [ e14 ] ) ) , which requires a fixed value for @xmath76 acting on external sites .",
    "since this on - site potential can be tuned by an external gate potential @xcite , the described itinerant ferromagnetism can be in principle even switched on by an external electric field .",
    "a detailed study of the phase diagram and the behavior in the thermodynamic limit is in preparation , and will be published elsewhere .",
    "a zig - zag hexagon chain described by a hubbard type of model containing on - site coulomb repulsion is analyzed in exact terms by a technique based on positive semidefinite operators .",
    "the calculations effectuated with periodic boundary conditions provide exact ground states of ferromagnetic and itinerant nature in the low concentration region .",
    "flat bands are not present in the non - interacting band structure , and the ferromagnetism is created by a joint effect of correlations and confinement .",
    "the parameter space region where the described phase emerges is not severely restricted , and the unique on - site one - particle potential which must have a fixed value can in principle be tuned by external gate potentials .",
    "the reason for the emergence of ferromagnetism is connected to two aspects .",
    "first , all operators entering in the construction of the ground state turn out to be extended .",
    "this is an interesting property of the studied system since it has not been observed for triangle , quadrilateral , and pentagon chains @xcite .",
    "second , all these extended operators with contributions in each cell act on lattice sites confined in the chain structure under consideration .",
    "hence by increasing the carrier concentration , connectivity conditions between the operators of the ground state wave vector will emerge .",
    "these connectivity conditions ( i.e. different operators describing different electrons act on common lattice sites ) fix the spin indices to the same value , minimizing in this manner as much as possible the double occupancy in order to reduce the ground state energy , and provide the ferromagnetic ground state",
    ". the itinerant nature of the obtained ferromagnetic ground state may open new application possibilities in spintronics .",
    "one adds below some observations related to the exact nature of the results .",
    "one knows that the flat band , or nearly flat band ferromagnetism can be described in exact terms @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that ferromagnetism emerging for completely dispersive band structure provided by spin - spin interactions in itinerant systems can also be described in exact terms @xcite .",
    "the here reported results enlarge the spectrum of exact descriptions relating ferromagnetism in completely dispersive systems : one demonstrates that when the joint action of confinement and correlations is present , itinerant ferromagnetism can be described in exact terms at finite value of the interaction even in the frame of a non - extended hubbard type of model .",
    "the deduced results deserve a further observation as well : in the search for organic ferromagnetism is no more necessary to look for hopping and on - site one - particle potential values in different chain structures in order to introduce flat bands in the system leading to flat band ferromagnetism .",
    "itinerant ferromagnetism can be obtained even in completely dispersive systems , for example by a joint effect of correlations and confinement .",

    "otka - t48782 and the alexander von humboldt foundation .",
    "let us consider the following pedagogical example for the construction of operators needed in the ground state wave vector .",
    "using the notations @xmath263 , the @xmath201 matrix from ( [ e24 ] ) becomes @xmath264 using for simplicity the conditions @xmath265 @xcite , for @xmath266 one obtains four unity eigenvalues .",
    "one of eigenvectors has only zero elements ( i.e. zero norm ) , so this can not be used to construct physical states , but three other eigenvectors have non - zero norm .",
    "these are the following ones @xmath267    let us consider first the @xmath268 eigenvector . for it one has @xmath269 taking @xmath270 one finds based on ( [ ea3 ] ) the following starting @xmath203 operator @xmath271 where the contributions from fixed @xmath234 cells are collected in parentheses",
    ". the second @xmath236 operator is obtained from ( [ ea4 ] ) by translating the starting point of the period with one cell , i.e. taking @xmath272 .",
    "one gets @xmath273 a further translation of @xmath268 to the following cell by taking @xmath274 provides @xmath275 while the fourth translation by taking @xmath276 reproduces @xmath203 . hence these steps do not provide new linearly independent @xmath0 operators .",
    "now one concentrates on the @xmath277 eigenvector . in this case one obtains @xmath278 taking @xmath279 one obtains the third linearly independent @xmath0 operator as follows @xmath280 the fourth @xmath281 operator is obtained from ( [ ea7 ] ) by translating the starting point of the period with one cell , i.e. taking @xmath282 .",
    "one gets @xmath283 continuing the translation by one cell and taking @xmath284 one obtains the @xmath285 operator as follows @xmath286 with @xmath287 one obtains the last independent operator generated by @xmath277 , namely @xmath288 , in the form @xmath289 the use of @xmath290 leads to @xmath0 operators linearly dependent on @xmath291 .",
    "further operators @xmath32 from the eigenvectors of @xmath266 presented in ( [ ea2 ] ) can not be constructed .",
    "but the list of new independent @xmath32 operators can be continued by looking for unity eigenvalues of @xmath292 , @xmath293 , and continuing the procedure presented above .",
    "for example in the present case @xmath294 has also unity eigenvalue holding eigenvector with non - zero norm @xmath295 with properties @xmath296 leading to following contribution by @xmath297 .    the linear independence of the explicit @xmath0 operators present in ( [ ea4],[ea5],[ea7 ] - [ ea10 ] ) results from the fact that each of them has a specific ( and different ) group of missing initial fermionic creation operators ."
