    "<S> synchrotron x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) experiments were performed on the network compounds ba@xmath0sr@xmath1al@xmath2o@xmath3 at temperatures between 15 and 800 k. the ferroelectric phase of the parent baal@xmath2o@xmath3 is largely suppressed by the sr - substitution and disappears for @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> structural refinements reveal that the isotropic atomic displacement parameter ( @xmath5 ) in the bridging oxygen atom for @xmath6 is largely independent of temperature and retains an anomalously large value in the adjacent paraelectric phase even at the lowest temperature . </S>",
