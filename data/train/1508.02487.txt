    "the vertical stabilizer of an aircraft is an essential element in providing the aircraft with its directional stability characteristic while ailerons and rudder serve as the primary control surfaces of the yawing and banking maneuvers . in the event of an aircraft losing its vertical stabilizer , the sustained damage will cause lateral / directional stability to be compromised and lack of control is likely to result in a fatal crash .",
    "notable examples of such a scenario are the crash of the american airline 587 in 2001 when an airbus a300 - 600 lost its vertical stabilizer in wake turbulence , killing all passengers and crew members @xcite and the crash of japan airlines flight 123 in 1985 when a boeing 747-sr100 lost its vertical stabilizer leading to an uncontrollable aircraft , resulting in 520 casualties @xcite .",

    "it is assumed that at one point during the flight , the vertical stabilizer is completely damaged , and in the followings the means to control such aircraft is investigated in such an extreme case scenario .",
    "for this purpose , first , the damaged aircraft model is developed for analysis , where the flight conditions for the damaged model are summarized in table [ table : flight conditions ] .",
    ".flight conditions [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table [ table : damaged_damping ] clearly indicates the unstable nature of the damaged aircraft in the dutch roll mode by the obvious right half plane ( rhp ) pole locations .",
    "furthermore , the pole of the spiral mode lies at the origin .",
    "the only stable mode of the damaged aircraft remains to be the roll mode .",
    "following the aerodynamic and stability analysis of the damaged aircraft , we next concentrate on the differential thrust methodology .",
    "with emerging advancements in manufacturing processes , structures , and materials , it is a well known fact that aircraft engines have become highly complex systems and include numerous nonlinear processes , which affect the overall performance ( and stability ) of the aircraft . from the force - balance point of view , this is usually due to the existing coupled and complex dynamics between engine components and their relationships in generating thrust . however , in order to utilize the differential thrust generated by the jet engines as a control input for lateral / directional stability , the dynamics of the engine need to be modeled in order to gain an insight into the response characteristics of the engines .",
    "engine response , generally speaking , depends on its time constant and time delay characteristics .",
    "time constant dictates how fast the thrust is generated by the engine while time delay ( which is inversely proportional to the initial thrust level ) is due to the lag in engine fluid transport and the inertia of the mechanical systems such as rotors and turbo - machinery blades @xcite .",
    "it is also suggested @xcite that the non - linear engine dynamics model can be simplified as a second - order time - delayed linear model as @xmath68 where @xmath55 and @xmath62 are the damping ratio and bandwidth frequency of the closed - loop engine dynamics , respectively ; @xmath37 is the time delay factor , and @xmath34 is the thrust command prescribed by the engine throttle resolver angle .    with the time constant defined as the inverse of the bandwidth frequency @xmath69 , and @xmath55 chosen",

    "the engine time constant is 1.25 seconds , and the time delay is 0.4 second @xcite .",
    "the engine thrust response curve at mach 0.65 and 20,000 feet is , therefore , obtained as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : engine_response ] , which provides a useful insight into how the time constant and time delay factors affect the generation of thrust for the jt9d-7a jet engine . at mach 0.65 and 20,000 feet , with the engine time constant of 1.25 seconds , and the time delay of 0.4 second",
    ", it takes approximately ten seconds for the engine to reach steady state and generate its maximum thrust capacity at 46,500 lbf from the trim thrust of 3221 lbf .",
    "the increase in thrust generation follows a relatively linear fashion with the engine response characteristic of approximately 12,726 lbf / s during the first two seconds , and then the thrust curve becomes nonlinear until it reaches its steady state at maximum thrust capacity after about ten seconds .",
    "this represents one major difference between the rudder and differential thrust as a control input .",
    "due to the lag in engine fluid transport and turbo - machinery inertia , differential thrust ( as a control input ) can not respond as instantaneously as the rudder , which has to be taken into account very seriously in control system design .      in order to utilize differential thrust as a control input for the four - engined boeing 747 - 100 aircraft , a differential thrust control module must be developed . here",
    ", the differential thrust input is defined as the difference between the thrust generated by engine number 1 and engine number 4 while the amounts of thrust generated by engine number 2 and 3 are kept equal to each other as shown in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : d_th]-[eq : th23 ] ) .",
    "this concept is illustrated in further details in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "@xmath71    @xmath72        engine number 1 and 4 are employed to generate the differential thrust due to the longer moment arm @xmath73 , which makes the differential thrust more effective as a control for yawing moment .",
    "this brings into the picture the need of developing a logic that maps the rudder input to differential thrust input , which is further explained in the following section .      when the vertical stabilizer of the aircraft is intact ( i.e. with nominal plant dynamics ) , the pilot has the ailerons and rudder as major control surfaces .",
    "however , when the vertical stabilizer is damaged , most probably , the pilot will keep on demanding the control effort from the rudder until it is clear that there is no response from the rudder . to eliminate this mishap , but to still be able to use the rudder demand , a differential thrust control module is introduced in the control logic , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : control_logics ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : dt_control_module ] , respectively .",
    "this differential thrust control module maps corresponding input / output dynamics from the rudder pedals to the aircraft response , so that when the rudder is lost , the rudder input ( from the pilot ) will still be utilized but switched to the differential thrust input , which will act as a _ rudder - like input _ for lateral / directional controls .",
    "this logic constitutes one of the novel approaches introduced in this paper .            as it can be also seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : control_logics ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : dt_control_module ] , the differential thrust control module s function is to convert the rudder pedal input from the pilot to the differential thrust input . in order to achieve",
    "that , the rudder pedal input ( in radians ) is converted to the differential thrust input ( in pounds - force ) which is then provided into the engine dynamics , as discussed previously in section [ propulsion ] . with this modification , the engine dynamics will dictate how differential thrust is generated , which is then provided as a `` virtual rudder '' input into the aircraft dynamics .",
    "the radian to pound - force mapping is provided in the next section , for the completeness of analysis .",
    "using fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] and with the steady , level flight assumption , the following relationship can be obtained : @xmath74    @xmath75    which means the yawing moment by deflecting the rudder and by using differential thrust have to be the same .",
    "therefore , the relationship between the differential thrust control input @xmath76 and the rudder control input @xmath77 can be obtained as    @xmath78    based on the flight conditions at mach 0.65 and 20,000 feet , and the data for the boeing 747 - 100 summarized in table [ table : flight conditions ] and table [ table : the undamaged aircraft data ] , the conversion factor for the rudder control input to the differential thrust input is calculated to be    @xmath79    due to the sign convention of rudder deflection and the free body diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] , @xmath52 here is negative .",
    "therefore , for the boeing 747 - 100 , in this study , the conversion factor for the mapping of a rudder input to a differential thrust input is found to be    @xmath80      at this point , the worst case scenario is considered , and it is assumed that the aircraft has lost its vertical stabilizer so that the rudder input is converted to the differential thrust input according to the logic discussed previously in this section .    unlike the rudder , due to delayed engine dynamics with time constant , there is a major difference in the commanded differential thrust and the available differential thrust as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dt ] .",
    "it can be seen from fig . [",
    "fig : dt ] that compared to the commanded differential thrust , the available differential thrust is equal in amount but longer in the time delivery . for a one degree step input on the rudder ,",
    "the corresponding equivalent commanded and available differential thrust are 7737 lbf , which is deliverable in ten second duration .",
    "unlike the instantaneous control of the rudder input , there is a lag associated with the use of differential thrust as a control input .",
    "this is due to the lag in engine fluid transport and the inertia of the mechanical systems such as rotors and turbo - machinery blades @xcite .",
    "this is a major constraint of plant dynamics and will be taken into account during the robust control system design phase in the following sections .",
    "following to this , the open loop response characteristics of the aircraft with a damaged vertical stabilizer to one degree step inputs from the ailerons and differential thrust are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : open_loop_response ] . here , it can be clearly seen that when the aircraft is damaged and the vertical stabilizer is lost , the aircraft response to the pilot s inputs is absolutely unstable in all four states ( as it was also obvious ( and expected ) from the pole locations ) .",
    "this shows the pilot will not have much chance to stabilize the aircraft in time , which calls for a novel approach to save the damaged aircraft .",
    "this is another point where the second novel contribution of the paper is introduced : automatic control strategy to stabilize the aircraft , which allows safe ( i.e. intact ) landing of the aircraft .",
    "as having been witnessed in section [ open loop ] , the open loop responses of the damaged aircraft are unstable in all four lateral / directional states .",
    "this means the pilot will not have much chance to save the aircraft , which calls for a novel approach to save the damaged aircraft and to provide a safe landing .",
    "therefore , in this section , the robust control system design based on @xmath0 loop - shaping approach is chosen as a means to stabilize the damaged aircraft due to its ability to suppress external disturbances and noise , and overall system robustness .",

    "the control inputs of the damaged aircraft are ailerons @xmath93 and differential thrust @xmath76 . as it is obvious from fig .",

    "it is also worth noting that there are also a differential thrust saturation limit of 43,729 lbf and a thrust generation rate limiter of 12,726 lbf / s imposed on the differential thrust control as discussed in section [ differential thrust ] .",
    "this is to make sure the control inputs are within the limits of both the ailerons and differential thrust .",

    "again , due to the differential thrust saturation set at 43,729 lbf and the thrust response limiter set at 12,726 lbf / s , this control effort of differential thrust in the presence of uncertainty is achievable in real life situation .",
    "this paper studied the utilization of differential thrust as a control input to help a boeing 747 - 100 aircraft with a damaged vertical stabilizer regain its lateral / directional stability .",
    "the motivation of this research study is to improve the safety of air travel in the event of losing the vertical stabilizer by providing control means to safely control and/or land the aircraft .    throughout this paper ,",
    "the necessary damaged aircraft model was constructed , where lateral / directional equations of motion were revisited to incorporate differential thrust as a control input for the damaged aircraft .",
    "then the open loop plant dynamics of the damaged aircraft was investigated .",
    "the engine dynamics of the aircraft was modeled as a system of differential equations with engine time constant and time delay terms to study the engine response time with respect to a commanded thrust input .",
    "next , the novel differential thrust control module was presented to map the rudder input to differential thrust input .",
    "the @xmath0 loop - shaping approach based robust control system design s ability to stabilize the damaged aircraft was proven as investigation results demonstrated that the damaged aircraft was able to reach steady state stability within only 15 seconds under feasible control efforts .",
    "further analysis on robustness showed that the @xmath0 loop - shaping approach based robust differential thrust methodology was also able to stabilize the uncertain plant dynamics in the presence of 30% full block , additive uncertainty associated with the damaged aircraft dynamics .    through listed analyses above , the ability to save the damaged aircraft by the robust differential thrust control strategy has been demonstrated in this paper .",
    "this framework provides an automatic control methodology to save the damaged aircraft and avoid the dangerous coupling of the aircraft and pilots , which led to crashes in a great number of commercial airline incidents .",
    "furthermore , it has also been concluded that due to the heavy dependence of the differential thrust generation on the engine response , in order to better incorporate the differential thrust as an effective control input in a life - saving scenario , major developments in engine response characteristics are also desired to better assist such algorithms",
