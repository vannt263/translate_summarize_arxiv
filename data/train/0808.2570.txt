    "dissipative solitons ( also known as localized structures ) are states in extended media that consist of one ( or more ) regions in one state surrounded by a region in a qualitatively different state ( in the following this _ surrounding _ state is an area in a stable stationary state ) . these structures were first suggested in refs .",

    "it has been shown that they can become unstable leading to excitable solitons in systems for which the local dynamics is not excitable @xcite . in this case",
    "excitability appears as an emergent property arising from the spatial dependence , which allows for the formation of these structures . in particular , for solitons arising in uniformly pumped kerr cavities , excitability is mediated by a saddle - loop ( homoclinic ) ( sl ) bifurcation , and it is characterized by a large excitability threshold and by occurring at any point of space that is properly excited @xcite .    since cs excitability emerges from the spatial dependence it is interesting to study the effect of breaking the translational symmetry on the excitable dynamics . in optical systems",
    "this can be easily done by applying a ( small amplitude ) localized beam on top of the homogeneous pump .",

    "in fact , the excitable behavior mediated by a snic , and reported in this work , should be easier to observe both numerically and experimentally , and present some practical features that make it more suitable for practical applications .",
    "in particular , the excitable threshold can be controlled by the intensity of the localized beam . with an array of properly engineered beams , created for instance with a spatial light modulator",
    ", one could create reconfigurable arrays of coupled excitable units to all - optically process information .",
