    "we let @xmath54 denote all vectors @xmath53 with @xmath55 , such that none of the numbers occurs twice , e.g. , @xmath56 but @xmath57 .",

    "$ ] are fully defined . on the other hand , in this case we have @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , which implies that all strictly off - diagonal holonomies are undefined for cyclic evolution .",

    "manini and pistolesi @xcite suggest an interpretation of their off - diagonal geometric phases in terms of berry phases for single closed paths . in the second order case ,",
    "these paths consist of the segments @xmath42 , @xmath9 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 , where @xmath74 geodesically connects the final point of @xmath42 with the starting point of @xmath9 , and vice versa for @xmath75 ( see fig . 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the general non - abelian case , however , this interpretation is difficult to maintain .",
    "apart from the special case when @xmath76 , it is not possible to join the curves @xmath77 , due to the mismatch of dimensions , and thus the closure using geodesics is not applicable .",
    "this observation shows that the off - diagonal holonomies in general can not be interpreted as standard wilczek - zee quantum holonomies for closed paths @xcite , and that the off - diagonal holonomies therefore are genuinely new concepts associated with the evolution of quantum systems .",
    "another consequence of the fact that we can have different @xmath11 is that the rank of @xmath78 can not be larger than the smallest @xmath11 ( see 2.17.8 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and thus may be less than @xmath79 .",
    "the non - abelian character of the off - diagonal holonomies @xmath80 $ ] implies that they are not invariant under cyclic permutations of the indexes @xmath81",
    ". it may even be the case that two off - diagonal holonomies that differ only by a cyclic permutation have different rank , since the smallest @xmath11 only provides an upper bound for the rank of @xmath78 .",
    "furthermore , as is exemplified below it is also possible that @xmath44 may have path - dependent nodal points if @xmath82 .",
    "as noted above , all strictly off - diagonal holonomies are undefined for cyclic evolutions , in analogy with the standard cyclic off - diagonal geometric phases .",
    "conversely , the noncyclic geometric phases are undefined when the states at the initial and final points of the curves are orthogonal , i.e. , there exist nodal points where these phases are undefined . the hope to recover this lost phase information appears to have been one of the primary reasons for manini and pistolesi to introduce off - diagonal geometric phases .",
    "however , the issue concerning the possible recovery of phase information was never explicitly investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the following",
    "we elucidate some aspects of this question in the case of non - abelian off - diagonal holonomies .",
    "let us first analyze what happens if the rank of some of the overlap matrices @xmath83 is greater than zero but less than their subspace dimension @xmath11 .",
    "this is a situation where the corresponding holonomies become partial @xcite ; a phenomenon that has no counterpart in the abelian case . to aid us in this analysis",
    "we introduce the unitary @xmath84 matrix @xmath85 it follows from unitarity that @xmath86 , where @xmath87 denotes the rank of matrix @xmath88 .",
    "furthermore , for every @xmath89 , it holds that @xmath90 , where @xmath91 denotes the @xmath92 identity matrix .",
    "this entails that ( see 2.17.2 and 2.17.5 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "so , if @xmath95 , then @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "in other words , when the overlap matrix @xmath83 decreases by @xmath98 in rank , the lower bound for the sum of the ranks of the matrices @xmath38 increases by the same amount .",
    "thus , the `` holonomy information '' that is lost when the holonomy of the curve @xmath9 becomes partial is transferred to the matrices @xmath38 .",
    "a perhaps more significant question is whether the rank of the matrices @xmath99 depends on the rank of the overlap matrix @xmath100 in a manner similar to what was discussed above for the matrices @xmath38 .",
    "one can demonstrate with a simple counterexample that no such relation exists .",
    "assume @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "furthermore , assume that @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 are the @xmath106 zero matrix , and @xmath107 one may verify that the corresponding matrix @xmath108 is unitary . in this example",
    "@xmath109 , and @xmath110 .",
    "hence , although none of the overlap matrices @xmath111 are of full rank , all strictly off - diagonal holonomies vanish , even those of higher order .    finally , we ask what happens if the matrices @xmath112 are zero for all @xmath7 .",
    "we prove by _ reductio ad absurdum _ that at least one of the strictly off - diagonal holonomies must have nonzero rank .",
    "assume @xmath113 , for @xmath114 , and @xmath63 , for @xmath115 , @xmath116 .",
    "consider an arbitrary string @xmath117 consisting of the integers @xmath118 to @xmath3 , and with @xmath119 . if @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) , then by assumption @xmath122 .",
    "if @xmath123 , then take one of the smallest subsequences @xmath124 that begins and ends with the same number ( i.e. , @xmath125 ) . in this subsequence",
    "there is no other repetitions ( otherwise there exists a smaller subsequence ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath126 . moreover , @xmath127 . if @xmath128 , then @xmath129 , otherwise @xmath130 by assumption .",
    "we proceed by noting that @xmath131 , for all @xmath132 , as a consequence of our assumptions",
    ". however , this can not be the case since @xmath108 is a unitary matrix .",
    "therefore , our assumptions must be wrong , and at least one of the strictly off - diagonal holonomies must have nonzero rank . by the above findings we can conclude that the holonomy information lost in the the nodal points of the non - abelian noncyclic holonomies indeed can be retained in some sense , but that the structure is much more intricate and rich than in the abelian case , due to the existence of partial holonomies in the non - abelian setting .",
    "we illustrate the off - diagonal holonomies by an example in the adiabatic context .",
    "we let the system evolve under the action of a slowly varying hamiltonian .",
    "let us consider the tripod system @xcite modeled by the parameter - dependent four - state hamiltonian @xmath133 , exhibiting two nondegenerate ` bright ' states @xmath134 with energy @xmath135 and a doubly degenerate ` dark ' zero energy eigenspace @xmath136 .",

    "<S> if a quantum system evolves in a noncyclic fashion the corresponding geometric phase or holonomy may not be fully defined . </S>",
    "<S> off - diagonal geometric phases have been developed to deal with such cases . here , we generalize these phases to the non - abelian case , by introducing off - diagonal holonomies that involve evolution of more than one subspace of the underlying hilbert space . physical realizations of the off - diagonal holonomies in adiabatic evolution and interferometry are put forward . </S>"
