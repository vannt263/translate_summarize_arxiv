    "studies of hard double parton scattering ( dps ) have a long history theoretically , with many references to prior work listed , for instance , in the recent review  @xcite",
    ". a greater rate of events containing multiple hard interactions is anticipated at the lhc , with respect to the experiments mentioned above , due to the much higher luminosity and greater energy of the lhc . moreover",
    ", the dps processes can constitute an important background  @xcite to signals from the higgs and other interesting processes .",
    "besides , certain types of multiple interactions will have distinctive signatures  @xcite , facilitating a detailed investigation of these processes experimentally and revealing information about parton pair correlations in the proton .",

    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 are the parton - level subprocess cross sections .",
    "the factor @xmath12 is a consequence of the symmetry of the expression for interchanging parton species @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 if @xmath16 and @xmath17 otherwise .",
    "note that these distribution functions also depend on the transverse vector * q * which is equal to the difference of the momenta of partons from the wave function of the colliding hadrons in the amplitude and the amplitude conjugated .",
    "such dependence arises because the difference of parton transverse momenta within the parton pair is not conserved .",
    "this transverse momentum * q * is the fourier conjugated variable of the parton pair transverse separation .",
    "the starting cross section formula  ( [ hardab_p ] ) is somewhat similar to that usually used for single parton scattering .",
    "it was found ( derived ) in many works using the light - cone variables and the same approximations as those applied to the processes with a single hard scattering .",
    "the main problem is to make the correct calculation of the two - parton functions @xmath18 without  @xcite additional simplifying assumptions ( the factorization of the impact - parameter dependence and @xmath19 dependence that , by no means , should be treated as inviolate ) .",
    "these functions and the corresponding evolution equations were considered in the current literature  @xcite only for @xmath20 in the collinear approximation . in this approximation the two - parton distribution functions , @xmath21 with the two hard scales set equal , satisfy the generalized dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) evolution equations , derived initially in refs .",
    "likewise , the single distributions satisfy more widely known and often cited dglap equations  @xcite .",
    "the functions in question have a specific interpretation in the leading logarithm approximation of perturbative qcd : they are the inclusive probabilities that in a hadron @xmath22 one finds two bare partons of types @xmath13 and @xmath14 with the given longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath6 and @xmath7 .    based on these well - known collinear distributions ,",
    "we have recently suggested  @xcite a practical method which makes it possible to estimate the inclusive cross section for a dps process without the oversimplified _ additional _ factorization assumption for @xmath23 ( which , in general , is inconsistent with the qcd evolution ) but taking into account the qcd evolution explicitly   and @xmath24 contributions of eqs .",
    "( [ hardab1 ] ) and ( [ d1xd2_s ] ) the factorization @xmath25 is assumed at a low starting scale @xmath26 only . ] .",

    "@xcite , with an emphasis on the differential cross sections , and were partly supported in ref .",
    "@xcite , albeit with some diversity of opinion regarding a terminology mainly .",
    "we found that single and double perturbative splitting graphs can meaningfully contribute to the inclusive cross section for a dps process , in comparison with a `` traditional '' factorization component .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to analytically study the structure of these single and double perturbative splitting diagrams as a source of parton pair perturbative correlations in the proton .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in order to be clear and to introduce the denotations",
    ", we briefly recall some basic formulas from our previous work  @xcite in sec .",
    "the double parton correlations in the double logarithm approximation of perturbative qcd are estimated in sec .",
    "the possible phenomenological issues at the lhc are discussed in sec .",
    "iv , together with conclusions .",
    "the inclusive cross section for dps can be presented in the following form  @xcite : @xmath27 where    @xmath28    @xmath29    or in substantially shorter yet less transparent form , @xmath30 and for the combined ( `` interference '' ) contribution , @xmath31.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath32 is the qcd coupling , and @xmath33 are the known single distribution functions ( the green s functions generated by the usual dglap kernels ) at the parton level with the specific @xmath34-like initial conditions at @xmath35 . the one - parton distribution ( before splitting into the two branches at some scale @xmath36 ) is given by @xmath37 .",
    "the splitting functions @xmath38 are the nonregularized one - loop well - known dglap kernels without the `` @xmath39 '' prescription .",
    "the single parton distribution functions @xmath40 are the solutions of the dglap equations with the given initial conditions @xmath41 at the reference scale @xmath26 and may be expressed via the green s functions @xmath42 in the following way : @xmath43    let us first consider the @xmath44 component which describes the two hard subprocesses @xmath2 and @xmath3 caused by the interactions of two pairs of partons in two independent branches of parton cascades .",
    "the probability of this double parton interaction depends on the spatial distribution ( in the impact - parameter transverse plane ) of these two branches of the parton cascade . in the momentum representation the spatial distribution",
    "is regulated by the two - parton ( in a low @xmath19 region this is mainly the two - gluon ) form factor @xmath45 . after the integration over @xmath46 it gives the factor @xmath47 which characterizes the transverse area occupied by the partons participating in hard collision and is often denoted as an effective cross section , @xmath48 .",
    "thus the value of the dps cross section depends on the spatial correlations between the two partons in the incoming proton ( hadron ) wave function . because of a strong @xmath49 ordering during the dglap evolution , the position of the parton in the impact - parameter , @xmath50 , plane is frozen , and the form factor @xmath51 describes the initial @xmath50 distribution formed in the nonperturbative region somewhere at a low scale , less than @xmath26 , where the dglap evolution starts .",
    "however , there is another sort of correlation caused by the splitting of one branch of the parton cascade into two branches .",
    "a splitting at the scale @xmath36 produces two branches placed rather close to each other , with the spatial separation @xmath52 .",
    "this effect is of perturbative origin and it may noticeably enlarge the dps cross section , leading to a lower mean value of @xmath48 .    depending on the kinematics of the dps process and experimental cuts , we may concentrate on the two - parton correlations coming from the nonperturbative region , that is , on the @xmath44 contribution or on the correlations of perturbative origin , like that in the @xmath53 term .",
    "the contribution of the combined component ( @xmath54 ) is regulated by the form factor @xmath45  @xcite from the side of one incoming proton and by the perturbative splitting on another side .",
    "since the form factor @xmath45 already provides the convergence of the @xmath46 integral in the low @xmath55 region , here we mainly deal with the `` long distance '' correlations from the nonperturbative region .",
    "the nonperturbative correlations corresponding to a low @xmath56 were discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , where it was proposed to consider the dps events with small transverse momenta of the systems @xmath2 and @xmath3 produced by the hard subprocesses .",
    "this would be a very interesting study , albeit such cuts select a very small part of the total dps cross section . an alternative possibility to study",
    "the correlations at a low scale @xmath56 is to measure the asymmetric dps processes where one `` hard '' scale @xmath57 is relatively low , say , the @xmath58-meson and high-@xmath59 dijet dps processes . since @xmath60 ( @xmath8 is a relatively low scale corresponding to @xmath58 production ) we have practically no space for pqcd splitting , and the @xmath44 configuration will dominate .",
    "there is some discussion in the current literature  @xcite concerning the @xmath53 component .",
    "this contribution incorporates the two splitting functions and the integration over @xmath46 without the strong suppression factor @xmath45 .",
    "formally , in the region of not too small @xmath19 , within the collinear approach this contribution should be considered as a result of the interaction of _ one _ pair of partons with the @xmath61 hard subprocess  @xcite , since the dominant contribution to the phase space integral comes from a large @xmath62 . however , as we argue in ref .",
    "@xcite there may be configurations with a rather large interval between the splitting point @xmath63 ) and the ( momentum ) coordinates @xmath64 of the hard subprocess .",
    "in such a case the interval will be filled by the evolution [ either dglap when @xmath65 or balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl )  @xcite when @xmath66 which will produce additional secondaries .",
    "the corresponding process can not be described by the @xmath61 hard matrix element . here",
    "we have to use our formulas  ( [ abtotal ] ) and ( [ d2xd2 ] ) , especially in the case of a configuration with two quite different scales ( for instance , @xmath67 ) .",
    "in order to understand the structure of these additional contributions ( @xmath54 and @xmath68 ) better , we consider them in the double logarithm approximation , which allows us to obtain some analytical estimations .",
    "let us write down all the integrations with splitting functions separately to make the analysis more transparent , @xmath69    because of the strong suppression factor @xmath70 in a single splitting diagram ( @xmath54 contribution ) , this integral @xmath71 can be estimated at the reference scale @xmath72 and can be considered as the qcd evolution correction to the factorized double parton distribution functions . for double splitting diagrams ( @xmath68 contribution )",
    "we should keep the further _ nonlogarithmic _ integration over @xmath46 in mind .    in the double logarithm approximation",
    "we can restrict ourselves to the main gluon contribution only and rewrite the integral under consideration in the following form  , @xmath73 . ] : @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",

    "the @xmath104 integration is not a saddle - point type , and therefore , one of the edges , namely @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) , dominates , provided that the initial gluon distribution does not grow too much as @xmath107 decreases .",
    "in fact , one needs @xmath108 at @xmath109 with @xmath110 , where @xmath111 .",
    "note that the parametrization of the initial gluon distributions usually used satisfies this condition ( e.g. , the cteq parametrization from ref .  @xcite ) .",
    "we are interested in the domain with large enough @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 , when the exponential factors are large in comparison with 1 and where the approximations above are justified . in this case",
    "the integration over the rapidity @xmath116 has a saddle - point structure in the wide interval of @xmath78 integration not near the kinematic boundaries .",
    "the saddle - point equation reads @xmath117 it may be solved explicitly in the simplest case of the two hard scales set equal , @xmath118 , and at @xmath119 , i.e. , in the @xmath78 region where @xmath120 and @xmath121   [ due to the singularity of the splitting function @xmath122 the contribution from the integration region near the kinematical boundaries @xmath123 and @xmath124 is not dominant , since in this case the obtained exponential factor @xmath125}$ ] is not leading [ less than in eq .",

    "now let us discuss in more detail what follows from our estimation of splitting integrals in the double logarithm approximation by the saddle - point method  .",

    "may be taken at the reference scale , i.e. , @xmath133 , due to the strong suppression factor @xmath70 .",
    "the characteristic value of @xmath46 is of the order of the `` effective gluon mass '' @xmath134 in the further @xmath46 integration .",
    "thus , one obtains for this contribution the following estimation : @xmath135}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this means that the splitting takes place at the `` characteristic point '' with the scale @xmath36 close to @xmath26 and with the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath136 ( the saddle point @xmath137 in this case ) . after splitting , one has two independent ladders with the well - developed bfkl  @xcite and dglap  @xcite evolutions .",
    "every ladder contributes to the cross section with the large exponential factor @xmath138}$ ] , which is just the same as for single distributions [ compare eq .",
    "( [ saddle1x2 ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ mellin in x=0 ] ) ] . therefore , in the double logarithm approximation single splitting diagrams  ( [ splitting - gluon ] ) have , in fact , the factorization property if one takes only the leading exponential factors into consideration .",
    "however , the contributions to the cross section from single splitting diagrams and from the factorization component differ in nonexponential factors omitted here , especially , in the different `` normalization '' at the reference scale : _ one _ `` nonperturbative '' parton for single splitting diagrams and _ two _ initial independent `` nonperturbative '' partons for the factorization component .      for double splitting ( @xmath68 )",
    "diagrams the leading exponential contribution arises from the lower limits of @xmath128 integration and either lower or upper limits of @xmath46 integrations , depending on the available rapidity interval @xmath140 .",
    "there is competition between the exponential factor caused by the evolution , which prefers a small @xmath141 , and the phase space factor in the @xmath56 integral .",
    "because of the nonlogarithmic character of the integration over @xmath142 for a not sufficiently large @xmath140 , the contribution from the upper limit of @xmath46 may dominate . indeed , let us consider the production of two @xmath143 pairs in a central rapidity ( @xmath144 ) region .",
    "that is , we take @xmath118 , @xmath145 and keep just the leading exponential factors in the double parton distributions , @xmath146 where for better accuracy we keep the term @xmath147 in the exponent of eq .",
    "( [ mellin in x=0 ] ) [ recall that here @xmath148 .",
    "thus the logarithmic @xmath149 integral takes the form @xmath150 with @xmath151 .",
    "the @xmath152 behavior of the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ l - int ] ) , @xmath153 is shown in fig .  1 in the case of @xmath154 and @xmath155 , corresponding to the lhc energy @xmath156 tev and the rhic energy @xmath157 gev ( to be more or less realistic , here @xmath140 is calculated as @xmath158 with @xmath159 ) .",
    "for this numerical estimation we take @xmath90 , @xmath160 and @xmath161 mev   and @xmath162 at @xmath163 and 20 gev@xmath164 , correspondingly . ] ; @xmath165 gev@xmath164 . in the lhc case",
    "we consider also the dps @xmath166-boson production , taking @xmath167 gev@xmath164 and @xmath168 .",
    "+      as it is seen in fig .  1 , where the relevant quantity @xmath170 is plotted , for the dps production of two @xmath143 pairs the major contribution comes from a low @xmath56 .",
    "that is , the reaction may be effectively described by the @xmath44 term ; the formation of two parton branches ( one to two splitting ) takes place mainly at low scales .",
    "however , at the rhic energy , when the available rapidity interval is not large , the @xmath56 dependence is not steep and the contribution caused by the splitting somewhere in the middle of the evolution is still not negligible .",
    "the same can be said about the dps @xmath166-boson production at the lhc . here",
    "the upper edge of the @xmath56 integral dominates .",
    "this part may be described as the collision of _ one _ pair of partons supplemented by a more complicated , @xmath61 or @xmath171 , hard matrix element . however , clearly we need to also account for contributions from the whole @xmath56 interval .    in other words ,",
    "depending on the precise kinematics , we may deal either with a single parton pair collision ( times the @xmath61 hard subprocess ) , with the contribution of the @xmath44 type , where the formation of two parton branches ( one to two splitting ) takes place at low scales , or with the @xmath53 configuration where the splitting may happen everywhere ( with more or less equal probabilities ) during the evolution .",
    "note that just this last possibility may be relevant for the lhc experiments .",
    "when both splittings take place at relatively small scales @xmath172 , the @xmath68 contribution _ can not _ be considered as the result of the interaction of _ one _ pair of partons with the @xmath61 hard subprocess , unlike the statement in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recall also that there may be a configuration with two quite different scales ( say , @xmath67 ) , in which the upper limit of the @xmath56 integral is given by a smaller scale ( at @xmath173 the hard matrix element corresponding to @xmath174 begins to diminish with @xmath175 ) . in this case",
    "the collinear evolution from the scale @xmath176 up to the scale @xmath9 in the ladders is sufficiently justified . a configuration with two quite different `` final '' rapidities [ for instance , @xmath177 is also interesting to probe single and double splitting diagrams , since the bfkl evolution takes place in the ladders before and after ( in one of ladders only ) splitting .",
    "here it is worth noticing that the asymptotic prediction mainly `` teaches '' us a tendency and tells us nothing practical about values of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , beginning from which the asymptotic behavior is a good approximation to the real one .",
    "therefore , it makes sense to consider the quantitative contribution of the @xmath53 term even within the collinear approach as applied to the lhc kinematics , where the large available values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( in comparison with @xmath178 and @xmath179 ) , @xmath180 and @xmath181 ( in comparison with 1 ) can provide configurations with the bfkl or dglap evolution in ladders before and after splitting , depending on the processes under consideration .",
    "a number of processes were suggested in order to probe dps at the lhc .",
    "promising candidate processes , such as same - sign @xmath166 production , @xmath182 production in association with jets , four - jet production , production of a @xmath183 pair with two jets , production of a @xmath184 pair with @xmath166 , have been discussed in detail in a review  @xcite , with many references to prior works listed therein .",
    "quite recently the processes with pairs of heavy quarkonia in the final state were considered  @xcite as precise probes of the dps at the lhc .",
    "we believe that production of a @xmath184 pair ( or @xmath185 ) with @xmath166 may be a good candidate process to probe the qcd evolution of the double distribution functions due to a configuration with two quite different scales .    for completeness , it is also interesting to estimate the value of the exponential factors available at the lhc kinematics in single ladder diagrams .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the distribution functions is determined by the factor @xmath186}=\\exp{[2.4\\sqrt{k_{\\rm bfkl } } \\sqrt{k_{\\rm dglap}}]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath187 at @xmath188 and        @xmath194 with the analogous dglap factor @xmath195 . in the bfkl case",
    "the resummation of the next - to - leading logarithmic corrections leads to @xmath196  @xcite , that is , the bfkl power @xmath197 , while for the dglap evolution we have @xmath198 .",
    "thus the lhc kinematics admits a wider interval for the bfkl evolution than for the dglap one in compatible dimensionless variables .",
    "therefore , it may be interesting ( and even more justified theoretically ) to consider the multiple parton interactions in the framework of the bfkl approach ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "+ in summary , we have demonstrated that all components of the generalized double distribution functions have the factorization structure in the double logarithm approximation and contribute to the cross section with the same leading exponential terms in @xmath140 and @xmath199 , but with different weights ( nonexponential factors ) .",
    "for the debatable double splitting diagrams , depending on the precise kinematics , we may deal either with a single parton pair collision ( times the @xmath61 hard subprocess ) , with the contribution of the @xmath44 type where the formation of two parton branches ( one to two splitting ) takes place at low scales , or with the @xmath53 configuration where the splitting may happen everywhere ( with more or less equal probabilities ) during the evolution . in order to probe the qcd evolution of the double distribution functions better , we suggest to also investigate the processes with two quite different scales , in particular , production of a @xmath184 pair ( or @xmath185 ) with @xmath166 , which was estimated at the lhc kinematical conditions in ref .",
