    "the radiation temperature  redshift relation has been examined in a dissipative universe .",

    "the model is equivalent to an extended @xmath2cdm model in a dissipative universe .",
    "therefore , it behaves as if a nonzero cosmological constant @xmath2 and a dissipative process are operative .",
    "a general radiative temperature law @xcite has been used in the model , to deduce a @xmath0@xmath1 relation for a dissipative universe . that relation has been computed in the late universe as a function of a dissipation rate ranging from @xmath3 , corresponding to a nondissipative @xmath2cdm model , to @xmath4 , corresponding to a fully dissipative ccdm model .",
    "the results confirm that the @xmath0@xmath1 relation for @xmath3 obeys a linear law in equilibrium .",
    "however , the calculated radiation temperature @xmath0 gradually deviates from the linear law with increasing @xmath5 , even if the background evolution of the universe is not altered . in particular , @xmath0 for @xmath4 is nonlinear because the effective equation - of - state parameter @xmath11 varies with time in a dissipative universe .",
    "in contrast , @xmath0 for low @xmath5 agrees with observations when @xmath134 ( i.e. , the background evolution is equivalent to that of a fine - tuned pure @xmath2cdm model ) .",
    "this agreement indicates that low dissipation describes the radiation temperature  redshift relation .",
    "that is , the dissipation rate is constrained by the observed @xmath0@xmath1 relation , even if density perturbations are not treated .",
    "the present study thus provides new insights into a dissipative universe .    to examine the influence of @xmath92",
    ", a likelihood analysis has been performed .",
    "a low-@xmath5 high-@xmath92 universe and a high-@xmath5 low-@xmath92 universe have high likelihoods , consistent with previous work @xcite in which a growth rate for clustering ( related to structure formations ) was examined . however , higher and lower @xmath92 values are inconsistent with supernova data .",
    "accordingly , a weakly dissipative universe ( @xmath199 ) for @xmath200 is a viable scenario . to examine this scenario in more detail ,",
    "a joint likelihood analysis has been performed .",
    "consequently , a weakly dissipative model proposed here is found to be very similar to the standard @xmath2cdm model because the expected dissipation rate is small .",
    "interestingly , recent works of the radiation temperature @xcite imply a more weakly dissipative model . however , the properties of a weakly dissipative model differ from those of a nondissipative @xmath2cdm model",
    ". therefore , further observations are necessary to determine whether a low - dissipation model is valid .",

    "<S> the @xmath0@xmath1 relation is derived from a general radiative temperature law , as appropriate for describing nonequilibrium states in a creation of cold dark matter ( ccdm ) model . using this relation , the radiation temperature in the late universe </S>",
    "<S> is calculated as a function of a dissipation rate ranging from @xmath3 , corresponding to a nondissipative @xmath2cdm model , to @xmath4 , corresponding to a fully dissipative ccdm model . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0@xmath1 relation for @xmath3 is linear for standard cosmology and is consistent with observations . </S>",
    "<S> however , with increasing dissipation rate @xmath5 , the radiation temperature gradually deviates from a linear law because the effective equation - of - state parameter varies with time . </S>",
    "<S> when the background evolution of the universe agrees with a fine - tuned pure @xmath2cdm model , the @xmath0@xmath1 relation for low @xmath5 matches observations , whereas the @xmath0@xmath1 relation for high @xmath5 does not . </S>",
    "<S> previous work also found that a weakly dissipative model accords with measurements of a growth rate for clustering related to structure formations . </S>",
    "<S> these results imply that low dissipation is likely for the universe . </S>",
    "<S> the weakly dissipative model should be further constrained by recent observations . </S>"
