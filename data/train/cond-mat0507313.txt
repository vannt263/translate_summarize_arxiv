    "aggregation is a fundamental irreversible process in which physical objects merge irreversibly to form larger objects .",
    "aggregation has numerous applications ranging from astronomy where planetary systems form via collisions of planetesimals , to atmospheric science @xcite , to chemical physics where polymeric chains chemically bond and form polymeric networks or gels @xcite , to computer science @xcite .",
    "the standard framework for modeling aggregation is as follows .",
    "initially , the system consists of a large number of identical molecular units ( `` monomers '' ) . a cluster ( `` polymer '' ) is composed of an integer number of monomers , termed the cluster mass .",
    "in each aggregation event , a pair of clusters merges , thereby forming a larger cluster whose mass equals the sum of the two original masses .",
    "when the number of aggregation events is unlimited , the system condenses into a single cluster .",
    "however , in most practical applications , other processes intervene well before that , and as a result , the final state has multiple clusters , rather than a single condensate .",
    "for example , fragmentation of large clusters into smaller clusters is one mechanism that may counterbalance aggregation and prevent condensation .    in this study , we focus on another control mechanism : freezing .",
    "we use the generic term freezing to describe situations where there are two types of clusters : reactive clusters that participate in aggregation events and passive clusters that do not participate in aggregation events .",
    "in particular , we consider the case where reactive clusters have a finite lifetime . in our model ,",
    "reactive clusters spontaneously turn into frozen clusters .",
    "spontaneous freezing can occur via various mechanisms .",
    "for instance , the environment may contain `` traps '' that absorb the diffusing polymers .",
    "in this situation , the reactive clusters are the free ( mobile ) polymers and the frozen clusters are the polymers adsorbed to the trap surface .",
    "another example is a system of linear polymers with reactive end monomers . in a merging event , two different chains chemically bond via the end monomers , while in a freezing event , the two end monomers of the same chain bond to form a ring .",
    "rings can no longer participate in aggregation events .",
    "thus , in this case the linear polymers are reactive and the ring polymers are frozen .    in aggregation with freezing ,",
    "it is natural to consider the initial condition where there are reactive clusters only .",
    "of course , the system ends with frozen clusters only .",
    "of special interest is the final mass distribution of frozen clusters . in this study",
    ", we address the two classical aggregation rates .",
    "first , we study the simplest aggregation process where the aggregation rate is independent of the cluster mass .",
    "we find that the mass distribution of reactive clusters decays exponentially with the cluster mass .",
    "in general , the mass density of frozen clusters also decays exponentially with the cluster mass .",
    "however , when the freezing rate is very small , there is a power - law behavior , @xmath3 , over a substantial range of masses .",
    "second , we consider the case where the aggregation rate is proportional to the product of the masses , a process that is widely used to model polymerization and gelation . we find that when the freezing rate exceeds a certain threshold , no gels form , while when the freezing rate is below this threshold , at least one gel forms .",
    "interestingly , the number of gels produced fluctuates from realization to realization . for supercritical freezing rates ,",
    "the mass distribution of frozen clusters decays exponentially , while below this threshold , it decays algebraically , @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "we analyze the stochastic process of aggregation with freezing using the rate equation approach .",
    "let us first consider the evolution of reactive clusters . in aggregation processes , two reactive clusters of masses @xmath5 and @xmath6 merge to form a larger reactive cluster of mass @xmath7 . the aggregation rate @xmath8 is a function of the two cluster masses .",
    "the freezing process is random : reactive clusters may spontaneously freeze with a constant rate .",
    "this freezing rate @xmath9 may be mass - dependent .",
    "therefore , the mass distribution @xmath10 of reactive clusters of mass @xmath11 at time @xmath12 evolves according to the generalized smoluchowki equation @xmath13 the first two terms account for gain and loss of clusters of mass @xmath11 , and the last term accounts for loss due to freezing .",
    "this master equation assumes perfect mixing as the probability of finding two clusters at the same position is a product of the probabilities of finding each of the clusters independently at the same position .",
    "we restrict our attention to the natural case of monodisperse initial condition , @xmath14 .",
    "the mass distribution of frozen clusters @xmath15 is coupled to the mass distribution of reactive clusters according to the rate equation @xmath16 it is simple to check that the total mass density @xmath17 is conserved by the evolution equations ( [ rk])([fk ] ) .",
    "initially , there are no frozen clusters so @xmath18 .",
    "eventually , all clusters become frozen , so the final mass distribution @xmath19 of frozen clusters is of particular interest .    the master equations ( [ rk])([fk ] )",
    "are sets of infinitely many coupled nonlinear differential equations , and they are generally unsolvable . even in the absence of freezing , these equations are solvable only for special aggregation rates @xcite .",
    "the three classical solvable cases are the constant rate @xmath20 , the sum rate @xmath21 , and the product rate @xmath22 .",
    "these cases represent natural aggregation processes .",
    "mass independent aggregation rates correspond to an aggregation process where two clusters are chosen randomly to merge .",
    "aggregation rates proportional to the product of the two cluster masses correspond to polymerization processes where two monomers are picked randomly to form a chemical bond ; consequently , their respective clusters are merged .",
    "the sum rate is a hybrid between the two as it is an aggregation process where a randomly chosen monomer bonds with a randomly chosen polymer . in this study , we focus on the two most widely used cases of constant and product aggregation rates .",
    "first , we discuss how the constant aggregation rate relates to polymerization in the presence of traps . to treat this problem formally , one should write down the master equations with inhomogeneous densities and add diffusion terms . then , one should study these equations in the trap - free region subject to the absorbing boundary conditions imposed by the traps .",
    "this approach is not practical and the reaction - rate approach provides a powerful alternative @xcite .",
    "the reaction - rate approach is roughly speaking an effective - medium theory that ignores the complicated influence of each trap on the diffusion of particles and instead , represents this influence by averages .",
    "the reaction - rate approach was used by smoluchowski to compute the aggregation rate @xmath8 for brownian particles . assuming that merging happens immediately upon collision , and that particles are spherical and have radii @xmath23 and @xmath24 and diffusion coefficients @xmath25 and @xmath26 , smoluchowski obtained @xmath27 stokes law shows that the diffusion coefficient of a brownian particle is inversely proportional to its radius , @xmath28 , and therefore the brownian kernel becomes @xmath29 here",
    ", we ignored the overall multiplicative factor as it is irrelevant for the current discussion .",
    "the master equations with this complicated brownian kernel have not been solved even in the case of pure aggregation . to simplify the analysis",
    ", smoluchowski suggested to replace the brownian kernel ( [ kb ] ) by the constant kernel .",
    "these two kernels have one common feature  they both are invariant under the dilatation @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , one expects that both kernels lead to similar behaviors , and to a certain extent , i.e. , as far as overall scaling properties are concerned , this approximation is sensible @xcite .    a straightforward extension of eq .",
    "( [ k ] ) gives the freezing rate @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the density of traps that are assumed to be spheres of radius @xmath33 and diffusion coefficient @xmath34 .",
    "the clusters are usually polymers whose molecular weight is small compared to the size of the traps ; hence @xmath35 and @xmath36 . therefore @xmath37 , yielding the mass dependence @xmath38    thus , a constant aggregation rate together with spontaneous freezing approximate aggregation of brownian particles in the presence of traps .",
    "we stress that the use of a constant aggregation rate instead of ( [ kb ] ) is an approximation .",
    "since the constant aggregation rate merely sets the overall time scale , we may conveniently set its value @xmath39 without loss of generality .",
    "let us first consider constant freezing rates , @xmath40 .",
    "the master equation ( [ rk ] ) becomes @xmath41 here , we used the total density of reactive clusters , @xmath42 .",
    "in general , for mass - independent freezing rates , it is possible to eliminate the freezing term from the master equation by transforming the mass distribution @xmath43 and introducing the time variable @xmath44 the time variable @xmath45 grows from @xmath46 to @xmath47 as the physical time increases from @xmath46 to @xmath48 . with these transformations , the governing equations for the densities @xmath49 reduce to the pure aggregation case with the total density @xmath50 .",
    "we briefly recall how to solve these equations .",
    "the total density obeys @xmath51 and subject to the initial condition @xmath52 , the total density is @xmath53 .",
    "let us now introduce the exponential ansatz @xmath54 with @xmath55 and @xmath56 to satisfy the initial conditions . substituting this ansatz into the master equation and equating mass - independent and mass - dependent terms separately , yields @xmath57 and therefore , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 leading to @xmath60 .",
    "the well - known solution for the pure aggregation case is therefore @xmath61    thus , the mass distribution of reactive clusters reads @xmath62 the exponential mass dependence is as in the pure aggregation case . also , the total density of reactive clusters is @xmath63 and as expected , the reactive clusters do eventually deplete @xmath64",
    ".    the mass distribution of frozen clusters is found by integrating the equation @xmath65 with respect to time .",
    "substituting ( [ ck - sol ] ) , and using , the integration is immediate and @xmath66 we see that in addition to the dominant exponential behavior , there is an additional algebraic prefactor .",
    "the total density of frozen clusters @xmath67 is found by summation , @xmath68 and in particular , the final density of frozen clusters is @xmath69 .",
    "also , the final mass distribution of frozen clusters is @xmath70 in general , the mass distribution decays exponentially , but there is a @xmath71 algebraic correction .",
    "the most interesting behavior occurs in the slow freezing limit : as @xmath72 , the final mass distribution becomes algebraic @xmath73 this power law holds over a substantial mass range , . beyond this scale ,",
    "the tail is exponential , .",
    "the results in the slow freezing limit can be alternatively obtained using perturbation theory .",
    "indeed , the modified time variable coincides with the original time variable , @xmath74 as @xmath75 , and the pure aggregation results are recovered . in other words , the freezing loss term @xmath76 can be neglected in the master equation ( [ rk ] ) . using this perturbation approach",
    "we address two related problems : general freezing rates and aggregation in low - dimensional systems .",
    "let us consider general mass dependent freezing rates @xmath9 .",
    "dropping the loss rate from the master equation , the reactive cluster density is as in the pure aggregation case @xmath77 , given by eq .",
    "( [ ck - sol ] ) .",
    "the mass distribution of frozen clusters is obtained by integrating eq .",
    "( [ fk ] ) @xmath78 we see that the algebraic prefactor @xmath71 is generic . therefore , the final mass distribution is @xmath79 this behavior applies for masses below some threshold mass @xmath80 , while the mass distribution sharply vanishes above the threshold .",
    "the threshold mass is estimated from mass conservation : @xmath81 as argued above , for brownian coagulation in the presence of traps , @xmath82 . for slow freezing ,",
    "@xmath83 , we conclude that the final mass distribution is algebraic , @xmath84 , below the threshold mass @xmath85 .",
    "the rate equation approach neglects spatial correlations as the probability of finding two clusters at the same position is represented by the product of the probabilities of finding each cluster separately at the same position .",
    "this mean - field approximation is valid only when the spatial dimension exceeds the critical dimension @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to study the behavior below the critical dimension .",
    "we address here the point cluster model ( pcm ) where the radii and the diffusion coefficients are both mass - independent . in this case @xmath87 .",
    "the lattice pcm is defined as follows : clusters occupy single lattice sites and hop to adjacent sites with rate @xmath34 ; if a reactive cluster hops onto a site occupied by another reactive cluster , both clusters merge .",
    "we assume that frozen clusters do not affect reactive clusters .",
    "the pcm without freezing can be solved exactly in one dimension .",
    "when all lattice sites are initially occupied by monomers , the density of reactive clusters of mass @xmath11 is @xcite @xmath88\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is the modified bessel function of order @xmath32 . here , we implicitly considered the slow freezing limit .",
    "the density of frozen clusters is found from @xmath90 , that is of course always valid . using the identity ,",
    "the final distribution of frozen clusters is @xmath91 remarkably , the very same answer ( [ fk - inf-1d ] ) is also found for the continuous version of the pcm . the mass distribution ( [ fk - inf-1d ] ) holds up to a certain threshold mass .",
    "for example , for the constant freezing rate @xmath92 the threshold mass is @xmath93 .",
    "the product aggregation rate @xmath22 is equivalent to the flory - stockmayer gelation model @xcite . in this model",
    ", any two monomers may form a chemical bond and when this happens the two respective polymers become one . thus , the aggregation rate equals the product of the cluster masses . in this polymerization process , a polymer network ( `` gel '' ) emerges in a finite time , and it is giant in the sense that it contains a finite fraction of the monomers in the system . eventually it grows to engulfs the entire system .",
    "this gelation model is also the simplest mean - field model of percolation @xcite .    as in the previous section ,",
    "we analyze in detail mass - independent freezing rates , @xmath40 , for which the master equation ( [ rk ] ) becomes @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the total mass density of reactive clusters .",
    "if all clusters are finite in size then @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the general @xmath32th moment of the distribution .",
    "again , we consider the monodisperse initial conditions @xmath98 and @xmath18",
    ".    low order moments of the mass distribution obey closed equations and thus , provide a useful probe of the aggregation dynamics .",
    "the total mass density of reactive clusters satisfies @xmath99 reflecting the loss due to freezing , and therefore @xmath100 the total mass density decays exponentially with the physical time , or equivalently , linearly with the modified time , @xmath101 .",
    "furthermore , the second moment includes in addition to the linear loss term , a nonlinear term that accounts for changes due to aggregation , @xmath102 . solving this equation with arbitrary initial condition yields @xmath103^{-1}.\\ ] ] divergence of the second moment",
    "signals the emergence of a gel in a finite time , i.e. , the occurrence of the gelation phase transition .",
    "fixing the freezing rate , the initial conditions govern whether gelation does or does not occur : gelation occurs when the initial mass is sufficiently large , @xmath104 , but otherwise there is no gelation .",
    "conversely , fixing the initial conditions , gelation occurs only for slow enough freezing .",
    "for the monodisperse initial conditions , the critical freezing rate is @xmath105 .",
    "when gelation does occur , the gelation time is @xmath106 the gelation point separates two phases . prior to the gelation time , the system contains only finite clusters that undergo cluster - cluster aggregation . past the gelation point",
    ", the gel grows via cluster - gel aggregation .",
    "we term these two the coagulation phase and the gelation phase , respectively .",
    "the above expressions for the first two moments are valid for the coagulation phase only .    the mass distribution of reactive clusters is found again by transforming the mass distribution @xmath107 and the time variable ( [ tau ] ) . with these transformations",
    ", the problem reduces to the no - freezing case , with @xmath108 . using the variable @xmath109 and the transformation @xmath110",
    ", the master equation reduces to a recursion equation for the _ time - independent _ coefficients @xmath111 : @xmath112 .",

    "hence , the mass distribution of reactive clusters is @xmath117 the corresponding generating function @xmath118 can be expressed in terms of the tree - function @xmath119 explicitly , the tree function is @xmath120 .",
    "the mass distribution ( [ formal ] ) is only a formal solution because the total mass density @xmath95 and hence the variable @xmath121 are yet to be determined .",
    "prior to gelation , the solution can be obtained in an explicit form because the various variables are known . from the first moment ( [ m1-sol ] ) then @xmath122 and therefore @xmath123 for @xmath124 . in this case",
    ", the mass distribution decays exponentially at large masses and the typical cluster mass is finite . when @xmath125 , there is no gelation transition , and this behavior characterizes the mass distribution at all times .",
    "otherwise , when gelation does occur , the gelation time ( [ tg ] ) is simply @xmath126 .",
    "the gelation point is marked by an algebraic divergence of the mass distribution , @xmath127 , for large @xmath11 .",
    "using the explicit expression for @xmath128 prior to gelation , we can calculate the mass distribution of the frozen clusters produced up to that point . substituting ( [ u ] ) into the formal solution ( [ formal ] ) and integrating @xmath129 over time using @xmath130 yields the distribution @xmath131 of frozen clusters produced prior to gelation ( @xmath132 for @xmath125 ) @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the incomplete gamma function .",

    "these asymptotic results were obtained using the steepest descent method .",
    "quantitatively , the mass distribution differs from that obtained for constant aggregation rates .",
    "however , qualitatively , there is a similarity : there is exponential decay above a critical freezing rate and algebraic decay at and below this critical freezing rate . for the constant aggregation rate , the critical freezing rate vanishes , but for the product aggregation rate the critical rate is finite .    at the gelation transition a giant cluster that contains",
    "a fraction of the mass in the system emerges . past the gelation point",
    ", two aggregation processes occur in parallel : in addition to cluster - cluster aggregation , the giant cluster grows by swallowing finite clusters .",
    "now , reactive clusters consist of finite clusters ( the `` sol '' ) with mass @xmath140 , and the gel with mass @xmath141 . the total mass density is @xmath142 .",
    "these three masses are coupled via the evolution equations    [ mst - eq ] @xmath143    the initial conditions are @xmath144 .",
    "the first equation reflects that as long as the gel remains reactive , mass may be converted from the reactive state to the frozen state via freezing of finite clusters .",
    "the second equation follows from @xmath145 , obtained by summing ( [ rkt ] ) .",
    "the second moment is written explicitly , @xmath146 , using the aforementioned identity .",
    "the initial conditions are @xmath144 .",
    "once these equations are solved , the solution ( [ formal ] ) becomes explicit .",
    "we analyze this equation using perturbation theory in the limits @xmath147 and @xmath148 as detailed in appendix a. for general freezing rates , we solve these equations numerically ( fig .",
    "[ sol ] ) .     for @xmath149.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in addition to the freezing of the finite clusters , the gel itself may freeze .",
    "one way to characterize the gel by its maximal possible size @xmath150 .",
    "the limiting behaviors are as follows ( see appendix a ) @xmath151 with @xmath152 .",
    "the maximal gel size decreases as the freezing rate increases . just below the critical freezing rate ,",
    "the gel is very small as its size shrinks quadratically with the distance from the critical point @xmath153 ; perturbation analysis shows that this behavior is generic and not limited to the maximal gel size .",
    "therefore , freezing is a mechanism for controlling the gel size : by using freezing rates just below the critical rate , it is possible to produce micro - gels .     versus the freezing rate @xmath154 ( solid line ) .",
    "perturbation theory results are shown using dashed lines.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the gel freezes following a random poisson process : its lifetime @xmath155 is distributed according to the exponential distribution @xmath156 as long as the gel is active the system evolves in a deterministic fashion .",
    "when the gel freezes , the total reactive mass exhibits a discontinuous downward jump ( fig .  [ mass ] ) .",
    "since the gel freezes according to a random process , the mass of the frozen gel is also a random variable .",
    "moreover , this quantity is not self - averaging as it fluctuates from realization to realization .",
    "( mass ) versus time @xmath45 ( time ) .",
    "the system alternates between the coagulation phase and the gelation phase . in the former phase",
    "the mass decreases linearly according to ( [ m1-sol ] ) such that depletion occurs at time @xmath157 . in the latter phase , the active mass decreases slower than linear according to ( [ mst - eq ] ) .",
    "the gelation phase ends when the gel freezes.,scaledwidth=37.5% ]    when the gel freezes , the system consists of finite - mass clusters only and therefore , the system re - enters the coagulation phase .",
    "the system may then undergo a second gelation transition that ends when the gel freezes .",
    "therefore , the evolution is cyclic with the system alternating between the coagulation and gelation . for the same reason that the gel mass fluctuates ,",
    "so is the number of frozen gels produced a fluctuating quantity .",
    "the number of gels produced is in principle unlimited , i.e. , there is a finite probability @xmath158 that @xmath32 gels are produced .",
    "since the second moment diverges at the gelation transition according to ( [ m2-sol ] ) , it is necessarily larger than the freezing rate at some finite time interval following the gelation transition .",
    "if the gel freezes during this time interval then a successive gelation is bound to occur .",
    "we also note that the evolution in the coagulation phase is deterministic and for example , the first two moments follow eqs .",
    "( [ m1-sol ] ) and ( [ m2-sol ] ) .",
    "the `` initial '' conditions are given by the state of the system when the gel freezes .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask : what is the probability that multiple gels are produced ? this is the probability that the gel freezes prior to time @xmath159 given by @xmath160 . using the second moment",
    "@xmath161 this condition simplifies to @xmath162 the probability that multiple gels are produced is obtained by integrating ( [ pt ] ) up to this time , with the limiting behaviors ( see appendix a ) @xmath163 this probability increases as the freezing rate increases ( figure [ pm ] ) .",
    "it is generally substantial , and moreover , it exhibits a discontinuity at @xmath164 .     versus the freezing rate @xmath154 ( solid line ) .",
    "perturbation theory results are shown using a dashed line.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    .",
    "the simulation results represent an average over @xmath165 independent realizations in a system of mass @xmath166.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we now address the final mass distribution of frozen gels .",
    "analytic treatment of the successive gelation phases is difficult due to the stochastic nature of the freezing process .",
    "numerically , there are two ways to treat the problem .",
    "one may integrate the rate equations ( [ mst - eq ] ) up to the gel freezing time that is distributed according to ( [ pt ] ) and then repeat this procedure if a successive gelation occurs .",
    "we prefer monte carlo simulations",
    "where , since the system is finite , there is no need to distinguish the gel from the finite clusters . in the simulations , we keep track of the total aggregation rate @xmath167 and of the total freezing rate @xmath168 , where @xmath169 is the number of monomers .",
    "aggregation occurs with probability @xmath170 , and freezing occurs with the complementary probability .",
    "a cluster is chosen for aggregation with probability proportional to its mass .",
    "time is augmented by @xmath171 after each aggregation or freezing event .    for the case @xmath172 ,",
    "numerical simulations provide convincing evidence that the tail behavior @xmath173 is universal ( fig .",
    "[ frozen ] ) .",
    "this indicates that frozen clusters produced during the coagulation phase dominate at large masses as every such phase is expected to contribute @xmath174 to the tail according to eq .",
    "( [ fk - tail ] ) . intuitively , this is clear because large clusters are quickly merged into the gel and therefore , frozen clusters produced in the presence of the gel tend to be small .",
    "interestingly , freezing leads to a new critical exponent in mean - field percolation .",
    "in summary , we studied aggregation processes with freezing . for constant freezing rates ,",
    "the problem can be formally reduced to the no freezing case .",
    "the mass distribution of frozen clusters resembles the mass distribution of reactive clusters , decaying exponentially at large masses , when the freezing is sufficiently fast .",
    "novel behavior emerges when the freezing rate is slower than some critical value . in this case",
    ", the mass distribution of frozen clusters decays algebraically . for constant aggregation rate ,",
    "the critical freezing rate is zero but for the product aggregation rate , it is finite .    for the product aggregation rate , the freezing rate controls the gelation process .",
    "if it is sufficiently high , no gelation occurs , and if it is just below the threshold , micro - gels are produced .",
    "if one gel is produced , then multiple gels are possible . in this case , the mass of the gels and their number are both controlled by a random process and as a result , they fluctuate from realization to realization .",
    "the system exhibits a series of gelation transitions and it alternates between ordinary coagulation and gelation .",
    "the random freezing process governs the number of percolation transitions as well as the mass of the frozen gels .",
    "the behavior when freezing occurs spontaneously is quite different than that found when freezing is reaction - induced ( upon merger a cluster may freeze with some fixed probability ) @xcite . for the constant aggregation rate ,",
    "the mass distribution is always algebraic and the characteristic exponent is non - universal as it depends on the freezing probability . for the product aggregation rate , the gelation transition is always suppressed , because the probability that a cluster remains reactive decays exponentially with the number of merger events .",
    "there are many open questions raised by this study .",
    "for example , it will be interesting to investigate the behavior in low - dimensional systems where the rate equation approach no longer holds .",
    "additionally , the exponent characterizing the mass distribution of frozen clusters represents a novel critical exponent in percolation processes and this should be a challenging problem below the critical dimension",
