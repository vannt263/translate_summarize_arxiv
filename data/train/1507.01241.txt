    "sampling is an efficient methodology that can be used for functional approximations @xcite .",
    "it is based on interpolation through a set of discrete points @xmath3 selected from a function @xmath4 within an interval @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "the sinc function @xmath6 is one of the most popular in sampling @xcite . specifically , due to its remarkable sampling property @xmath4",
    "can be represented as a series approximation @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath2 is a small parameter that at @xmath8 can be regarded as the step .",
    "we have shown recently a new methodology of sampling based on incomplete cosine expansion of the sinc function in numerical integration @xcite .",
    "another very useful sampling tool can be constructed by using the gaussian function @xmath9 .",
    "the sampling property of the gaussian function @xmath9 can be observed by changing its variable as @xmath10 and then considering the limit @xmath11 where the kroneckers delta @xmath12 is a building block of _ the shah function _ , also known as _ the comb function _ : @xmath13 ( see application of _ the shah function _ @xmath14 in sampling in @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , this example shows that the gaussian function can also be utilized for functional approximations by sampling methodology .",
    "it is convenient to modify the gaussian function @xmath9 by multiplying a constant @xmath15 and making change of the variable as @xmath16 .",
    "this results in @xmath17 where the @xmath1 is the fitting parameter .",
    "figure 1 shows three variations of the sampling gaussian function computed at @xmath18 , @xmath19 ( black curve ) , @xmath18 , @xmath20 ( blue curve ) and @xmath18 , @xmath21 ( red curve ) . we may attempt to approximate @xmath4 by replacing the sinc functions in equation with the gaussian functions of kind as given by equation @xmath22 consequently , choosing the sampling points separated equidistantly with step @xmath2 between two adjacent points we obtain @xmath23        the application of the gaussian function of kind can be justified by considering a simplest case when @xmath24 .",
    "figure 2 shows the corresponding approximations at @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath25 ( blue curve ) and @xmath18 , @xmath20 , @xmath25 ( red curve ) .",
    "the multiplication of the number of the sampling points to the step determines the range for approximation @xmath26 . as a consequence , the approximated functions shown in fig .",
    "2 resemble the window function .",
    "in particular , these functions are approximately equal to @xmath27 within the range @xmath28 $ ] and to @xmath29 otherwise . as we can see from this figure , at smaller @xmath1 the approximated function oscillates near the constant @xmath27 at the top of the curve stronger ( blue curve ) . however , as @xmath1 increases the oscillation rapidly decreases ( red curve ) and practically vanishes at @xmath30 .",
    "this signifies that if the change in curve between any two adjacent sampling points is relatively small , then any function can be approximated by sampling with the gaussian function .        in this work",
    "we introduce an application of the complex error function to the fourier analysis .",
    "in particular , we show that the use of equation in the fourier integration leads to a weighted sum of the complex error functions . due to remarkable property of the complex error function",
    "this approach provides efficient computational methodology in the fourier transform as a damping harmonic series .",
    "the complex error function , also known as the faddeeva function or the kramp function , is defined as @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the complex argument .",
    "this function is a solution of the following differential equation @xcite @xmath33    the complex error function finds broad applications in many fields of applied mathematics @xcite , physics @xcite and astronomy @xcite . in applied mathematics",
    "it is closely related to the error function of complex argument @xcite @xmath34 \\leftrightarrow { \\rm{erf}}\\left ( z \\right ) = 1 - { e^ { - { z^2}}}w\\left ( { iz } \\right),\\ ] ] the normal distribution function @xcite @xmath35 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the fresnel integral @xcite @xmath36/2 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the dawsons integral @xcite @xmath37    in physics and astronomy the complex error function is related to the voigt function @xcite @xmath38 that describes the spectral behavior of the photon emitting or absorbing objects ( photo - luminescent materials @xcite , planetary atmosphere @xcite , celestial bodies @xcite and so on ) .",
    "specifically , the voigt function represents the real part of the complex error function @xmath39 , \\quad\\quad y \\ge 0.\\ ] ] other functions that can be expressed in terms of the complex error function are the plasma dispersion function @xcite , the gordeyevs integral @xcite , the rocket flight function @xcite and the probability integral @xcite .",
    "the complex error function can be represented alternatively as ( see equation ( 3 ) in @xcite and @xcite , see also appendix a in @xcite for derivation ) @xmath40 using the change of the variable as @xmath41 in the integral above leads to @xcite @xmath42 further , we will use this equation in derivation of the weighted sum .",
    "a rapid c / c++ implementation ( roofit package from cenrs library ) for computation of the complex error function with average accuracy @xmath43 has been reported in the recent work @xcite .",
    "there are several definitions for the fourier transform . in this work",
    "we will use the following definitions @xcite @xmath44 and @xmath45 thus , the relationships between functions @xmath4 and @xmath46 are performed by two operators @xmath47 and @xmath48 corresponding to the forward and inverse fourier transforms , respectively . in signal processing the arguments @xmath49 and @xmath50 in these reciprocally fourier transformable functions @xmath4 and @xmath46 are interpreted , accordingly , as time vs. frequency @xcite .",
    "we can find an approximation to the fourier transform of the function @xmath4 by substituting approximation into equation .",
    "this leads to @xmath51 taking into account that @xmath52 the equation can be rewritten as @xmath53 since change of the variable @xmath54 leads to @xmath55 the equation can be rearranged as @xmath56 comparing this equation with equation yields @xmath57",
    "lastly , defining the constants @xmath58 we can rewrite approximation in a more compact form as a weighted sum @xmath59}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the equation can be expressed through any functions that have been considered in the section @xmath60 above .",

    "the derivation of approximation for the inverse fourier transform is straightforward now .",
    "comparing integrals , and using approximation we immediately obtain @xmath62 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the coefficients are calculated as @xmath63 .",
    "since the gaussian function rapidly decreases with increasing @xmath64 , only few terms with negative index @xmath65 actually contribute to shape the curve @xmath4 along the positive @xmath49-axis where the fourier integration takes place according to equation . as a result",

    "in particular , the application of these _",
    "ready - made _ precomputed values enables us to simplify considerably the approximations and for the forward and inverse fourier transforms as given by @xmath75 and @xmath76 accordingly .      as an application of the precomputed values @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , @xmath80 in approximations and helps us to avoid a _ real - time _ computation of the complex error functions , this technique significantly accelerates an algorithmic implementation",
