    "more precisely , the empirical distribution of the eigenvalues of @xmath33 tends weakly as @xmath16 to a rotationally invariant light tailed law @xmath32 , while the empirical distribution of the singular values of @xmath33 tends weakly as @xmath16 to a heavy tailed law @xmath34 . by the above reasoning",
