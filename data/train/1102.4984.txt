    "the interaction of h atoms and molecules with carbon based materials like graphite , single wall carbon nanotubes ( swcnt ) and graphene has attracted considerable interest during the last two decades , since these systems are of interest in fields as diverse as astrochemistry , hydrogen storage and nanoelectronics .",

    "h@xmath0 formation in interstellar dust and molecular clouds is expected to occur via recombination of h atoms adsorbed on interstellar dust grain surfaces . since carbonaceous grains are abundant in the interstellar medium , particular attention is focused on h chemisorption on graphite surfaces @xcite .",

    "the precise mechanism of h adsorption in these structures is unknown since these values are well above the estimated limit of 1% for h@xmath0 physisorption at room temperature @xcite . for graphene a theoretical maximum storage capacity of 7.7 wt %",

    "+ recent fabrication of graphene has generated an enormous number of new studies focused on the prospects of using graphene as a key material in post silicon electronics @xcite .",
    "the high electron mobility can be exploited for construction of ballistic transistors operating at frequencies unreachable with current semiconductor materials @xcite . yet , for applications in nanoelectronics efficient methods and tools for tailoring the electronic properties of graphene are required .",
    "one of the most promising routes towards the opening of a band gap in graphene is based on its hydrogenation @xcite .",

    "in other dimer structures and for many of the large h clusters , the recombination includes one or several diffusion steps of h atoms leading to the formation of the embedded p - dimer , followed by the h@xmath0 associative desorption .",
