    "these recent results suggest that the multiplicity properties of young ( @xmath9few myr ) substellar objects in star - forming regions may be substantially different from the old ( @xmath9few gyr ) field population .",
    "if common , these young binaries also provide serious constraints for current theories of brown dwarf formation , since such wide binaries can not be formed by a non - dissipative ejection model @xcite .",
    "however , most of these objects were either discovered serendipitously , are from surveys with unpublished statistics , or are from surveys with very few objects of comparable mass , so it is unknown how significant a population they form . here",
    ", we conduct a systematic survey to search for such binaries in upper sco , the nearest ob association to the earth .",
    "at an age of @xmath95 myr and a distance of 145 pc @xcite , the upper scorpius ob association is one of the nearest sites of ongoing star - formation and is intermediate in age between very young star - forming regions such as taurus ( @xmath21 myr ) and somewhat older young field objects ( @xmath9100 myr ) . additionally , upper sco is denser than nearby t associations such as taurus and chamaeleon but considerably less dense than high - mass star - forming regions such as the trapezium in orion @xcite .",
    "binarity of young objects may vary both as a function of age and environment @xcite .",

    "* ) and the absence of such binaries in the field population ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests some evolution of brown dwarf binary properties must occur as a function of age .",
    "thus , upper sco provides a key binarity data point , intermediate in both age and density .",
    "some low mass stars and high mass brown dwarfs in upper sco have already been studied for binarity @xcite .",
    "numerous binarity studies have been conducted which are sensitive to very low substellar mass companions for very young clusters such as taurus @xcite , chamaeleon @xcite , ic 348 @xcite , ngc 1333 @xcite , as well as upper sco @xcite  however , the least massive primaries observed in these surveys have generally been limited to higher mass brown dwarfs ( @xmath740 m@xmath4 ) . to date ,",

    ", we extend binarity results to lower mass brown dwarfs and planetary mass objects in upper sco .",
    "we surveyed a sample of 20 substellar objects in upper sco with reported spectral types of m7.5 or later .",
    "these objects were selected from those with spectroscopic confirmation @xcite from the near - ir photometric and proper motion surveys of @xcite . according to the models of @xcite ,",
    "these objects are all substellar .",
    "indeed , these are the least massive objects currently known in upper sco , with estimated masses of @xmath240 m@xmath4 , thus this survey doubles the number of young , low mass brown dwarfs imaged to search for binarity . at the 5 myr age of upper sco , these objects are quite hot , hence their late m and early l spectral types .",
    "eventually , these objects will cool to become t dwarfs .",
    "we focus in particular on 18 objects selected from @xcite which form a consistently selected and analyzed sample .",
    "survey objects are listed in table  [ tab : objects ] .",
    "we observed 20 objects with the facility infrared camera nirc2 and the laser guide star adaptive optics system @xcite on the 10 m keck ii telescope .",
    "observations were conducted on the nights of 2007 - 07 - 17 , 2008 - 07 - 27 , 2009 - 05 - 29 , 2009 - 05 - 30 , and 2009 - 06 - 30 .",
    "conditions varied considerably between nights .",
    "we used the nirc2 narrow camera , with a 9.963@xmath10.005  mas  pixel@xmath10 platescale and a 10.2@xmath0@xmath1110.2@xmath0 field of view .",
    "search observations were conducted in the ks filter ( @xmath12 = 2.146 @xmath13 m ) .",
    "objects were observed using a 3 point dither pattern , with a dither of 1 - 2.5@xmath0 between positions .",
    "observations are detailed in table  [ tab : observations ] .",
    "the data were reduced in real time at the telescope using a custom iraf pipeline . in cases where a candidate companion was detected at the telescope , immediate followup observations in j and h bands",
    "were then conducted .",
    "the observed object fwhm ( @xmath14 band ) varied from 55 - 130 mas , with strehl ratios in @xmath14 varying from 6 to 29@xmath5 .",
    "fwhms and strehl ratios were calculated using the standard keck lgs routine nirc2strehl.pro .",
    "most objects appeared slightly elongated in the direction of the tip - tilt reference star .",
    "we used a custom idl pipeline for a final reduction of the data .",
    "the idl pipeline corrects for on - chip distortion , flat fields , sky subtracts , and registers images using a cross - correlation algorithm .",
    "images were visually inspected for candidate companions .",
    "a number of faint candidate companions to several survey objects were identified at separations of @xmath71@xmath0 . to be considered true companions , candidates must possess red colors similar to their primary and have common proper motion .",
    "candidates to usco j160603.75 - 221930.0 and usco j160723.82 - 221102.0 were reobserved 1 year after the initial observations and found to be background ( i.e. not common proper motion objects ) .",
    "colors for other candidates were checked in the zyjhk bands of the uk infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ) or in the digital sky survey ( dss ) .",
    "the ukidss project is defined in lawrence et al ( 2007 ) .",
    "ukidss uses the ukirt wide field camera ( wfcam ; casali et al , 2007 ) .",
    "the photometric system is described in hewett et al ( 2006 ) , and the calibration is described in hodgkin et al .",
    "the pipeline processing and science archive are described in irwin et al ( 2009 , in prep ) and hambly et al ( 2008 ) .",
    "one candidate companion to usco j160830.49 - 233511.0 was too faint to be detected in the ukidss data ( @xmath1519 ) .",
    "this candidate will be reobserved at keck in spring 2011 ; however , given its faintness and wide separation ( @xmath95.4 , @xmath9780 au ) , it is most likely background .",
    "all of the other @xmath71candidates were detected with s / n @xmath7 10 in our keck lgs ao data and were well - detected in the ukidss data .",
    "all ukidss detected objects were found to have colors significantly bluer than their primary ; this is a clear sign that these objects are blue background objects as opposed to a red brown dwarf or planetary mass companion .",
    "since our survey objects are quite faint and our ao correction is in general moderate , we did not attempt psf subtraction to search for faint companions within 1@xmath0 of the object . most of our objects show some elongation towards the tip - tilt star . additionally , image quality varied considerably between nights and during individual nights .",
    "thus , it was not possible to build a reliable synthetic psf for psf subtraction .",
    "we note that our brighter targets had a number of superspeckles evident within 0.5@xmath0 of the primary which can mimic the appearance of a companion .",
    "however , these superspeckles modulate with wavelength and also evolve as a function of time . by comparing multiple images taken at different times or wavelengths , it is almost always possible to distinguish speckles from real companions .",
    "in fact , we did initially flag a number of close - in candidates which proved to be speckles upon further examination .",
    "a close candidate companion ( 0.14@xmath0 ) was detected around sch j16091837 - 20073523 ( henceforth sch 1609 - 2009 ) with colors consistent with a young substellar object .",
    "photometry and astrometry for this object is presented in table  [ tab : objphot ] .",
    "photometry and astrometry were determined using two different methods : 1 ) daophot psf - fitting photometry using iraf and 2 ) synthetic psf - building photometry using binfit and starfinder in idl .    for the daophot psf - fitting photometry , a background object in the field ( with separation @xmath75@xmath0 from the primary and blue colors as expected for a background object ) was used as a psf for the allstar task .",
    "the psf object was well detected in both h and k bands .",
    "however , our reduced ao correction in the blue j band relative to the h and k resulted in a lower signal to noise detection of the psf star in the j band , diminishing our photometric accuracy in j band .    since we were somewhat concerned that the background object used as a psf at @xmath75@xmath0 might be affected by anisoplanetism , we also determined the the binary separation , position angle ( pa ) , and flux ratio using the starfinder psf - fitting software package @xcite as an independent confirmation of the daophot results .",
    "starfinder simultaneously solves for an empirical psf model and the positions and fluxes of the binary components .",
    "our @xmath16-band images had significantly poorer fwhms and strehl ratios such that starfinder did not converge on a solution .",
    "thus , for @xmath16 band we instead used a three - component gaussian model , as described by @xcite , to derive the binary parameters from psf - fitting .",
    "the uncertainties were determined from the rms of the best - fit parameters for our individual dithered images .",
    "we adopted the astrometric calibration of @xcite , with a pixel scale of 9.963@xmath10.005  mas  pixel@xmath10 and an orientation for the detector s @xmath17-axis of @xmath180@xmath1913@xmath10@xmath1902 east of north .",
    "we applied the distortion correction developed by b. cameron ( 2007 , private communication ) , which changed our astrometry below the 1@xmath6 level .",
    "both daophot and starfinder methods yielded nearly identical values ( within the cited errors ) for photometry and astrometry .",
    "we show the primary and companion on color - magnitude and color - color diagrams in fig  [ fig : colors ] .",
    "the companion possesses very similar colors to its primary , suggesting that it is a true substellar companion .",
    "we estimated the likelihood that this companion is a background object using source counts from the 2mass survey . within 1 degree of the primary ,",
    "2mass detects 527 objects with j of 13 mag or brighter , 506 objects with h of 12.4 or brighter , and 427 with k of 12 or brighter .",
    "thus , adopting the approach of @xcite , in particular , their equation 1 , we estimate the probability of finding an unrelated source at least as bright as the observed companion within 0.14@xmath0 of the primary to be @xmath92.6@xmath1110@xmath20 .",
    "sch 1609 - 2007 was reobserved with nirc2 at keck ii on 1 may 2010 .",
    "the overall quality of the dataset was poor ; however , we acquired sufficient data to demonstrate that the companion likely has common proper motion with the primary . measuring centroid positions of the primary and companion ( as the 2nd epoch data were not high enough quality for psf - fitting photometry ) , the companion moved by @xmath20.7 pixels relative to the primary between epochs , consistent with the errors in our simple center - of - light centroiding .",
    "as no directly measured proper motion is available for sch 1609 - 2007 we adopt the mean value of ( -11 , -25 ) mas yr@xmath10 for upper sco here @xcite . at a distance of 145 pc , parallax motion for upper sco",
    "is quite small  @xmath97 mas . as the parallax factor in",
    "the 2nd epoch observation was similar to that in the first , we neglect parallax here . with the @xmath910 mas pixel scale of narrow camera , we would have expected the companion to move @xmath92.3 pixels relative to the primary between epochs if it was a background object at a much larger distance . thus , this is likely a proper motion pair .",
    "it has been noted that objects from @xcite are considerably brighter than objects of similar spectral type from @xcite .",
    "in fact , in some cases , the discrepancy is as much as 2 or 3 magnitudes , e.g. the m8 objects sch j1622 - 1951 and usco j155419.99 - 213543.1 in the sample for this survey .",
    "one possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the later type @xcite objects consist primarily of nearly equal mass binaries , such as sch j1609 and likely sch 1622 - 1951 as well .",
    "however , even after accounting for binarity , sch j1609 - 2007 is still 2 - 3 mag overluminous compared to similar objects from the @xcite sample .    the discrepancy may also be due to systematic differences between optical and infrared spectral types for these objects , which are right at the m to l type spectral transition .",
    "all of the @xcite sources have optical spectral types while the @xcite sources have infrared ones , so in effect we may be comparing apples vs. oranges .",
    "thus , to further constrain the near - ir spectral type ( and hence mass ) of sch j1609 - 2007ab we obtained integrated - light near - ir spectroscopy of sch1609 - 2007 on 2010",
    "september 14 ( ut ) using the spex spectrograph @xcite on the nasa infrared telescope facility . a series of 12 exposures of 30 seconds each were taken , nodding along the slit , for a total integration time of six minutes .",
    "our observations were taken at an airmass of 1.57 , and the seeing recorded by the irtf was 0@xmath219 the data were taken using the low - res prism with the 0@xmath215 slit aligned with the parallactic angle , producing a 0.82.5  @xmath13 m spectrum with a resolution ( r=@xmath22 ) of @xmath9150 . for telluric correction of our sch1609 - 2007 spectrum , we observed a nearby a0v star , hd  149827 and obtained calibration frames ( flats and arcs ) .",
    "the spectra were reduced using the facility reduction pipeline , spextool @xcite , which includes a correction for telluric absorption following the method described in @xcite .",
    "spectra and spectral fits are presented in fig  [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "sch1609 - 2007ab was assigned a composite optical spectral type of m7.5 by @xcite .",
    "we determine spectral types for each component by comparing our integrated light near - ir spectrum of sch1609 - 2007ab to synthetic composites generated from template near - ir spectra of known members of upper scorpius ( also taken with spex at the irtf , at the same resolution as the sch1609 - 2007ab spectrum , brendan bowler , priv comm ) .",
    "our upper scorpius templates have optical spectral types ranging from m4 to m8.5 .",
    "we verified that our templates have near - ir spectral types ( calculated using the h@xmath23o index of allers et al .",
    "2007 ) that agree to within 1 subtype with their optical types .    to create our synthetic composite spectra , we first calculated synthetic photometry for each template using the @xmath24 and @xmath25 filter profiles for nirc2 and normalized each spectrum by the photometric flux density .",
    "we interpolated the templates to the same wavelength grid as our spectrum of sch1609 - 2007 , and summed pairs of template spectra together , multiplying the later spectral type template by the flux ratio of the binary .",
    "following the technique described in cushing et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , we determined a multiplicative constant for each template in each band ( @xmath26 and @xmath25 ) , and computed a reduced @xmath27 performed over the wavelength ranges @xmath28 = 0.961.3 @xmath13 m , 1.481.8 @xmath13 m , and 2.052.4@xmath13 m .",
    "the best fitting template is the composite spectrum of uscoctio  75 ( m6 , ardila et al .",

    "2004 , slesnick et al . 2008 ) .",
    "we assign spectral types of m6.0 @xmath1 0.5 to sch1609 - 2007a and m7.0 @xmath11.0 to sch1609 - 2007b , where uncertainties are determined from the spectral types of synthetic composite spectra where @xmath29 + 1 , significantly earlier than the combined m7.5 spectral type from @xcite .",
    "we estimate the masses and effective temperatures of sch 1609 - 2007 ab based on the dusty models of @xcite and the temperature scale of @xcite .",
    "the age of upper scorpius has been measured as 5 myr , with a spread of up to 2 @xcite , but more recent work suggests ages as old as 10 myr",
    "( eric mamajek , private communication ) .    thus to account for age spread",
    ", we estimate masses at discrete ages of 5 and 10 myr using the dusty models @xcite and at an age range of 5@xmath11 myr using dust - free models from the same group @xcite . for single age mass estimates , we simulated the spectral type range of each object with an input distribution of 10@xmath30 gaussian - distributed spectral type values centered on the measured spectral type and with @xmath6 set to the error on the measured spectral type .",
    "we then converted this input distribution to effective temperatures using the temperature scale of @xcite and to estimated mass using the @xcite models .",
    "the estimated mass of each object was set to the mean of the output distribution and the error on the mass was set to the standard deviation of the output distribution . via this method , we estimate primary and secondary masses of 79@xmath117 m@xmath4 and 55@xmath125 m@xmath4 at an age of 5 myr and masses of 84@xmath115 m@xmath4 and 60@xmath125 m@xmath4 at an age of 10 myr .    for mass estimates for a range of ages , we simulated input spectral type and ages with an input distribution of 3@xmath1110@xmath31 gaussian - distributed spectral type and age values .",
    "as before , the spectral type values were centered on the measured spectral type , with @xmath6 set to the error on the measured spectral type .",
    "the center of the age distribution was set as 5 myr , with @xmath6=1 myr .",
    "interpolation with the @xcite temperature scale and @xcite models was performed to convert from spectral type to estimated mass for the distribution . since the output distribution is somewhat asymmetric , we adopt the median as the best mass estimate and again use the standard deviation to set the error . via this method",
    ", we estimate primary and secondary masses of 79@xmath121 m@xmath4 and 60@xmath131 m@xmath4 .",
    "thus , for the range of ages that are realistic for this binary , the uncertainty in the measured spectral type dominates the mass estimate above and beyond any uncertainty in the age .",
    "we estimate the semimajor axis of sch 1609 - 2007ab s orbit from its observed separation . assuming a uniform eccentricity distribution between 0 @xmath2 e @xmath2 1 and random viewing angles , dupuy & liu ( 2010 )",

    "the 5-@xmath6 contrast curves for our core sample of 18 objects from @xcite are presented in figure  [ fig : contrasts ] .",
    "noise levels after data reduction were calculated as a function of radius by calculating the standard deviation in an annulus ( with width equal to the fwhm of the psf ) centered on that radius .",
    "noise curves were then converted to contrast in @xmath35mag by dividing by the measured peak pixel value of the object .",
    "contrasts were converted into absolute magnitudes using photometry reported in @xcite and adopting a distance of 145 pc for upper sco .",
    "a filter transform was calculated from k to k@xmath36 band using the spectra from @xcite .",

    "a table of contrast values at separations of 0.07 , 0.2 , and 0.5is presented in table  [ tab : cont_q ] .    to test the fidelity of our contrast curves , we inserted and retrieved simulated objects in our data .",
    "objects were simulated as 2 dimensional gaussians with fwhms from fits to the primary using the idl routine gaussfit2d and contrasts from our measured contrast curves .",
    "objects simulated with contrasts from our measured curves were retrieved with s / n@xmath375 for all survey targets down to separations of 0.07@xmath0 . for separations down to 0.06@xmath0 , simulated objects were retrieved for half of our survey targets .",
    "no simulated objects were retrieved at separations @xmath38 0.05@xmath0 .",
    "thus , we conclude that our measured contrast curves are a reliable estimate of the detectable contrasts for potential companions down to separations of 0.07@xmath0 .",

    "it is almost always possible to distinguish speckles from real companions .",
    "thus , since we can distinguish between the two , we believe that our contrast curves adequately measure obtained contrasts for this survey , despite potential speckle confusion .",
    "contrasts were converted to minimum detectable mass ratios using the models of @xcite at an adopted age of 5 myr and assuming a similar bolometric correction ( i.e. a similar spectral types for both objects ) between each target and any potential companion ( figure  [ fig : q ] and table  [ tab : cont_q ] ) .",

    "in other words , if the prior probability is a beta distribution and the likelihood is a binomial distribution , then the posterior probability will also be a beta distribution . in this case , it is instructive to view the likelihood as an `` operator '' on the prior probability which produces as a result the posterior probability . when a binomial distribution `` operates '' on a beta distribution with prior hyperparameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the result is the following posterior distribution :    @xmath51    thus , in our case where @xmath471 :    @xmath52    thus , our posterior probability distributions for each sample are given by :    @xmath53    @xmath54    the posterior probability density for @xmath55 is then given by :    @xmath56    we used monte carlo methods in the r programming language to evaluate this integral .",
    "10@xmath57 random deviates were taken from each posterior probability beta distribution and the posterior probability density for @xmath55 was determined from these .",

    "we present the 1-@xmath6 ( 68@xmath5 ) and 2-@xmath6 ( 95@xmath5 ) confidence intervals from the posterior probability density for @xmath55 as a counterpart to the fisher exact test likelihoods .",
    "these confidence intervals quantify the probable relationship between the true binary fractions of the two samples .",
    "for example , for the second comparison presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : bayesian ] , a sample with 0 binaries detected out of 25 objects compared with a sample of 6 binaries detected out of 23 objects , at the 1-@xmath6 level @xmath58 for the 2nd distribution lays between @xmath59 + 0.15 and @xmath59 + 0.33 .",
    "we compare our measured binary fraction to that of more massive brown dwarfs and very low mass stars in the upper sco embedded cluster .",
    "@xcite surveyed 12 brown dwarfs and very low mass stars with acs on hst .",
    "these objects have estimated masses of 0.04  0.1 m@xmath3 and thus comprise a higher mass sample than our survey .",
    "@xcite discovered three binaries in this sample , one of which ( usco-109 ab ) is below the sensitivity of our survey to detect , with a projected separation of only @xmath95 au .",
    "thus , for the purposes of comparison , we adopt a binary fraction of 2/12 = 17@xmath60 % for the @xcite sample .",
    "the likelihood that the @xcite sample is drawn from the same distribution as ours is 0.15 , with a 1@xmath42 bayesian confidence interval of @xmath61 = -0.28 , 0.15 .",
    "thus , as noted by previous authors @xcite , the binary fraction in upper sco continues to decrease with decreasing primary mass .",
    "this comparison is limited by the relatively small number of objects observed in upper sco .",
    "thus , to improve statistics , we have compiled a larger list using objects from similar surveys of other young , nearby regions  specifically taurus ( @xmath21  myr ,  145  pc ,  objects  from * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and chamaeleon ( @xmath23  myr ,  160  pc ,  objects  from * ? ? ?",
    "we include only companions that would have been detected at the sensitivity level of our survey and initially limit this analysis to nearby clusters ( @xmath2200 pc ) since more distant clusters ( e.g. ngc 1333 , ic 348 , serpens ) are more than 250 pc distant and do not reach comparable sensitivity levels at 10 au .",
    "all selected surveys have similar sensitivity levels ( complete to q@xmath90.8 at 10 au , complete to q@xmath90.2 - 0.3 at @xmath3920 au ) so it is unlikely that our survey would have discovered a binary at a separation @xmath710 au missed by these other surveys , and vice versa .",
    "we adopt 3 mass bins for this analysis : ( 1 ) high mass ( 0.07  0.1 m@xmath3 ) , with 6 binaries detected out of 23 objects surveyed ( 6 objects from ahmic et al .",
    "2007 , 5 from kraus et al . 2006 , 6 from kraus et al .",

    "2008 sample surveyed herein ) .",
    "we note that while a number of additional binaries are known in this mass range , e.g. 2mass 1207ab @xcite , 2 m 1622 @xcite , uscoctio 108 @xcite , and 2mass 0441 @xcite , survey statistics are not available for these objects and thus we can not include them in our sample .",
    "binary fractions and likelihoods between bins as a function of mass are presented in table  [ tab : tests1 ] . as expected , the binary fraction decreases monotonically with primary mass .",
    "the likelihood that the low mass bin ( @xmath20.04 m@xmath3 ) objects share the same binary fraction as the high mass bin ( @xmath70.07 m@xmath3 ) is less than 0.02 , with a 1@xmath42 bayesian confidence interval of @xmath61 = -0.34 , -0.15 .      by ages of 1 gyr",
    ", most of our survey objects will have cooled to become t dwarfs .",
    "thus , it is interesting to compare the primordial binary fraction of these objects to the binary fraction of similar objects in the field .",
    "our survey is only sensitive to companions at projected separations of @xmath710 au , however , this is a particularly interesting separation space to probe , as older field t dwarf binaries rarely have separations this large @xcite . in fact , of the 32 t dwarfs surveyed in @xcite , no companions were detected with separation @xmath710 au ( down to q@xmath390.4 , i.e. comparable sensitivity limits to our survey ) .",
    "this places an upper limit on the binary fraction @xmath710 au of 5@xmath5 . again using the fischer exact test method",
    ", we found a likelihood of 1 with a very tight 1@xmath42 bayesian confidence interval of @xmath61 = -0.02 , 0.07  i.e. , given the small sizes of both of these samples , they are very likely drawn from the same parent sample .",
    "thus , the very low mass brown dwarf binary fraction appears to be similar for both young and field objects .",
    "binary fractions , likelihoods , and bayesian confidence intervals between bins as a function of age are presented in table  [ tab : tests2 ] .",
    "do higher mass objects ( @xmath70.07 m@xmath62 ) in young clusters also have a similar binary fraction ( @xmath710 au ) as their counterparts in the field ?",
    "we compare the binary fraction ( @xmath710 au separation ) for 6 binaries discovered out of 23 young objects ( the `` high mass '' bin from the previous section ) drawn from binarity surveys of upper sco @xcite , taurus @xcite , chamaeleon @xcite and this work with that of 1 binary ( @xmath710 au separation ) discovered from 39 field m8l0.5 objects from close et al .",
    "these two samples share a similar mass range ( primary mass between 0.07  0.1 m@xmath3 ) , but very different wide binary fractions : 26@xmath63% for the young sample vs. 2.6@xmath64% for the old field sample .",
    "using the fischer exact test , the likelihood that these two samples are drawn from the same binomial distribution is 0.01 with 1@xmath42 bayesian confidence interval of @xmath61 = 0.14 , 0.32 .",
    "thus , for objects with mass @xmath7 0.07 m@xmath3 , there is an overabundance of 1050 au separation very low mass binaries in young clusters relative to the field .",
    "upper sco is a somewhat older and higher density ob association , while taurus and chamaeleon are more diffuse , younger t clusters .",
    "thus , we also compare binary fraction between these two different ages and environments . combining the sample described in the previous section and separating by region , we find 3 binaries detected from 34 objects in taurus and chamaeleon and 3 binaries detected from 32 objects in upper sco .",
    "the binary fraction is nearly the same between the two , although it is important to note that the sample in taurus and chamaeleon has systematically higher primary masses than that in upper sco ( dominated by the 18 very low mass brown dwarfs surveyed in this paper . )",
    "thus , given the trend in binary fraction with mass , the binary fraction in upper sco may be considerably higher than in taurus .",
    "we initially limited our statistical analysis to nearby clusters ( @xmath2200 pc ) since more distant clusters ( e.g. ngc 1333 , ic 348 , serpens ) are more than 250 pc distant and do not reach comparable sensitivity levels at separations of 10 - 30 au .",
    "however , including results from surveys of these more distant clusters significantly boosts sample size .",
    "in particular , including the results from the @xcite hst survey of ic 348 ( 2 myr , 315 pc ) introduces 31 additional @xmath80.1 m@xmath3 objects into this analysis . in order to match the achieved contrast and physical resolution of the @xcite survey with those of nearer regions ( upper sco , taurus , chamaeleon ) we only consider results for separations from 30 - 500 au . including objects from @xcite in our 3 mass bins from earlier sections ,",
    "we now find : ( 1 ) in the high mass bin ( 0.07  0.1 m@xmath3 ) , 3 binaries are detected out of 43 objects surveyed ( usco-55 and usco-66 from kraus et al . 2005 and usco1609 from this work have separations @xmath230 au and thus would not be detected at the combined sensitivity limits for our composite survey ) , ( 2 ) in the medium mass bin ( 0.04  0.07 m@xmath3 ) , 0 binaries detected out of 20 objects surveyed , and ( 3 ) in the low mass bin ( @xmath20.04 m@xmath3 ) , 0 binaries detected out of 36 objects surveyed .",
    "as before , the lowest mass cluster bin possesses a very similar upper limit on binarity as the field t dwarf bin and wide binaries seem to be rare in both the medium and low mass cluster bins . comparing the high mass bin with the low mass bin",
    ", we find a likelihood of 0.25 that these two samples are drawn from the same binomial distribution , with a 1@xmath42 bayesian confidence interval of @xmath61 = -0.11 , -0.02 .",
    "we also compare the high mass bin with the close et al .",

    ", the likelihood that these two samples were drawn from the same binomial distribution is 0.24 ( as opposed to 0.01 for the same bin in the nearby sample . ) thus , a significant overdensity of young binaries relative to the field is apparent in this sample only at moderate separations ( 10 - 30 au ) , and not at wide ( 30 - 500 au ) separations .      up to @xmath925@xmath5 of very low mass ( henceforth vlm ) stars and substellar objects in young star forming",
    "regions may have companions at separations @xmath710 au .",
    "however , very low mass star / brown dwarf binaries with separations @xmath715 au are rare in the field . of @xmath9100 vlm binaries compiled at vlmbinaries.org ,",
    "only @xmath910@xmath5 have separations @xmath715 au .",
    "assuming a binary fraction of @xmath910@xmath5 , this means that less than 1@xmath5 of field vlms have companions at separations @xmath715 au @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that very wide ( @xmath750 au ) young brown dwarf binaries are disrupted within the first 10 myr of their existence by interactions with stars in their natal cluster . to set limits on the survival time of a young wide binary in its natal cluster",
    ", they adopt the analytic solution of fokker - plank ( fp ) coefficients from @xcite which describes the advective diffusion of a binary due to stellar encounters .",
    "namely , from this solution , the time t@xmath65 necessary to evaporate a binary with initial semimajor axis a@xmath66 is :    @xmath67    where n@xmath68 is the number density of stellar perturbers of mass m@xmath68 and relative velocity v@xmath69 . using this relationship , @xcite determine that young wide vlm binaries such as 2 m 1207 - 39ab will not survive 10 myr of interactions with 0.7 m@xmath3 stellar perturbers with a number density n@xmath68 of 1000 pc@xmath70 . thus , @xcite show that most of these binaries will not survive to join the field if born in a dense starforming region .",
    "we determine here whether the same is true for moderately wide 10  50 au binaries . while @xcite assume a number density of nearby stars of 1000 pc@xmath70 , which is appropriate near dense core regions , it is probably too high for objects in diffuse areas of taurus or chamaeleon . assuming a typical density of 100 pc@xmath70 for for taurus , ophiuchus , and upper sco , we repeat this calculation for the six binaries that fall into our highest mass bin ( specifically , cfht - tau 7 , cfht - tau 17 , and cfht - tau 18 from @xcite , usco-55 and usco-66 from @xcite , and sch 1609ab , the newly discovered binary presented herein ) .",
    "we find that all of these binaries are quite stable and will survive @xmath710 myr in either a 100 pc@xmath70 environment or a 1000 pc@xmath70 environment ( i.e. long enough to join the field population ) . an environment with stellar densities",
    "@xmath710@xmath57 pc@xmath70 ( equivalent to the trapezium cluster in orion ) is necessary to disrupt these binaries on @xmath210 myr timescales .",
    "the existence of a significant population of these medium - separation binaries presents a conundrum , since very low mass stars and brown dwarf binaries with separations @xmath715 au are rare in the field .",
    "however , the field brown dwarf population encompasses a mix of objects which formed in a variety of different star - forming regions .",
    "@xcite suggest that brown dwarf binaries with separations @xmath720 au are found rarely in the field because they can only form in low - density star - forming regions , while the majority of field objects formed in denser initial regions where any such binary would be disrupted .",
    "however , other authors have suggested that most stars in the field likely form in ob associations like upper sco @xcite , so this is problematic .",
    "the existence of this population of moderately wide young brown dwarf binaries in lower density young clusters initially suggests that most ( predominantly single ) field brown dwarfs must form in high stellar density regions which disrupt such wide binaries by late ages .",
    "however , this supposition relies on our ability to distinguish between `` typical '' vs. `` atypical '' star - forming regions , as well as to truly disentagle the primordial vs. evolved populations .",
    "in other words , the evolved population is the outcome of the formation mechanism plus any subsequent evolution in the cluster .",
    "different combinations of formation and subsequent evolution may form the same evolved population . here , we have placed constraints on binary evolution within a relatively diffuse cluster environment ; placing constraints on formation mechanism is more difficult .",
    "forming brown dwarfs at all has always been a tricky prospect theoretically .",
    "brown dwarf formation theories require either : ( 1 ) a mechanism to produce very low jeans masses ( e.g.  turbulent  fragmentation ,  gravitational  fragmentation  of  infalling  gas , and  gravitational   fragmentation  with  a  magnetic  field ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or ( 2 ) a method to circumvent the need for very low jeans masses , ( e.g.  ejection ,  or  gravitational  instability  followed  by  binary  disruption   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) unfortunately , more information is needed regarding the physical properties of these star - forming regions ( i.e. measurement of turbulent motions , magnetic fields ) to distinguish between these models .",
    "for instance , widespread filamentary structure has recently been observed by herschel in very young star - forming clouds in aquila and polaris @xcite .",
    "however , it is not currently clear what causes these filaments ; if turbulence or magnetic fields are the dominant cause , this has significant ramifications for subsequent brown dwarf formation in these regions .",
    "likely a mix of formation mechanisms are at play in any given region , the detailed physics of which may vary from region to region . disentangling",
    "these physics is a difficult prospect and requires more information than just binary fraction . while we can rule out pure ejection ( without any dissipation from e.g.  a circumstellar disk ) from our measured binary fraction and the existence of a significant population of @xmath710 au separation binaries",
    ", other models may produce a significant wide binary population which may be disrupted by late ages in dense clusters .",
    "we searched for binary companions to 20 brown dwarfs in upper scorpius ( 145 pc , 5 myr , nearest ob association ) with the laser guide star adaptive optics system and the facility infrared camera nirc2 on the 10 m keck ii telescope .",
