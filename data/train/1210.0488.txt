    "the ability to achieve inversion and lasing in atomic and solid state systems is a topic of continuing interest @xcite . in the domain of cavity - qed , regimes of `` single atom lasing '' and non - classical light emission",
    "have been studied @xcite .    according to the common wisdom ,",
    "any scheme to achieve population inversion must exploit a multi - level manifold of material states ; steady - state inversion is not possible for a driven two - level system .",
    "this wisdom is restricted , however , to a simple two - level system ( tls ) coupled to classical fields in a non - engineered environment . when interacting with a _",
    "quantized _ radiation mode , a tls may be inverted by two - photon excitation to higher lying levels of the quantized _",
    "matter plus field _ @xcite . also , when in interaction with an environment near a photonic bandgap",
    ", a tls may be inverted by way of an asymmetry of the mollow triplet ; although , very high ( many orders of magnitude ) contrast in the sideband decay rates is required @xcite .",
    "in contrast to atoms , the unique features of semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) include their large optical dipole moment and engineerable emission wavelength .",
    "other attractive features are their fixed position and potential for integration with cavities and waveguides using developed semiconductor fabrication techniques @xcite .",
    "although semiconductor microcavity lasers are today quite common @xcite , there is an ongoing push to realize more exotic regimes , such as `` single qd lasing , '' with the aim of producing a non - classical light source in a solid state nanostructure .",
    "single dot lasing _ per se _ is not addressed in this work .",
    "rather , we focus on the fundamental mechanisms available to achieve population inversion in a semiconductor qd - cavity system .",
    "semiconductor qds differ from atoms at the level of fundamental physics , and this calls for extra care when describing the light - matter interaction .",
    "typically , qds are embedded in a solid state lattice where electron - phonon interactions , though sometimes ignored in quantum optical studies , are known to impact optical properties ; they affect photoluminescence lineshapes @xcite , coherent rabi oscillation @xcite , and the mollow triplet spectrum of resonance fluorescence ; phonon - mediated scattering can cause excitation - induced dephasing @xcite , which is detrimental to the exploitation of quantum optical interactions .",
    "it is interesting , then , to ask what impact this scattering has when one tries to coherently drive an excitonic transition coupled to a quantized radiation mode into a regime of population inversion @xcite . in answer",
    "we find a surprising result : contrary to the expectation that it might be detrimental , acoustic - phonon - mediated scattering can be exploited to achieve significant exciton inversion via a mechanism entirely different to those previously reported to invert a simple tls .",
    "the mechanism is richer and significantly more efficient .",
    "it relies on the natural asymmetry of phonon emission and absorption at low bath temperatures , and for cavity driving , exploits a one - way coupling ( phonon - assisted scattering ) between the exciton and the cavity mode when the latter is blue detuned with respect to the zero phonon line ( zpl ) .",
    "population inversion in a qd in the presence of phonons without cavity coupling has been reported in previous theoretical studies .",
    "_ @xcite employed path integral and correlation expansion techniques to explore the long - time behaviour of a coherently driven qd with phonon coupling and noted that away from resonance large population inversions can be realized .",
    "the authors compare their results with a simple model based on thermalization in dressed states and find good agreement for the parameters considered .",
    "one limitation of this work is the omission of zpl decay processes ; these are generally needed for the quantitative modeling of experiments .",
    "et al._@xcite also studied the driven exciton - phonon system , again with no cavity coupling , and report population inversion in a _ unstructured _ phonon bath .",
    "they consider a coherently driven double - dot system in the large pump limit in a dressed - state approach .",
    "phonon coupling is included as a perturbation and exciton inversion reported for a phonon bath with subquadratic spectral density .",
    "both of these works exploit phonons to achieve tls inversion with continuous wave ( cw ) drive . with",
    "the qd embedded in a cavity , it is not known how these processes change , nor is it known what differences , if any , arise between the two methods of driving now made available : direct driving of the exciton or driving through the cavity .",
    "it is not known how zpl decay processes effect the achievable population inversion .    in this work",
    "we investigate several mechanisms realizing pump - induced exciton inversion in a qd - cavity system with cw driving .",
    "we propose and characterize the phonon - assisted scheme using a semiconductor quantum - optics formalism that includes phonon interactions by way of an effective master equation ( me ) .",
    "the me uses a polaron transform to take electron - acoustic - phonon interactions into account at a microscopic level , and includes cavity and qd decay in a lindblad description .",
    "it yields an intuitive and transparent modeling of the qd - cavity dynamics through a combination of photon and phonon scattering .",
    "we consider a qd embedded within a small high @xmath2 dielectric cavity , as shown schematically in figs .",
    "[ fig : schematic1](a ) and [ fig : schematic1](b ) .",
    "either the exciton or cavity mode is subject to coherent cw driving ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the figure ) .",
    "a possible advantage of cavity over exciton driving is that it might mitigate problems with excitation - induced dephasing , a process that accompanies excitation via the exciton - phonon reservoir ; it also allows for pumping through a waveguide input channel @xcite [ cf .",

    "we have reported on a number of different ways to create exciton inversion in a semiconductor quantum - dot cavity system with cw drive .",
    "the underlying mechanism exploits a highly efficient phonon - mediated scattering process to create excitons via direct incoherent excitation or through the annihilation of a cavity photon ; the reverse process takes place at a much reduced rate in a low temperature bath . at a phonon bath temperature of @xmath1 ,",
    "exciton populations greater than 0.9 are easily achievable .",
    "direct exciton excitation and excitation through a coupled cavity are found to be qualitatively different . in particular ,",
    "in the latter case , the effect of cavity filtering is important and depends upon the sign of the cavity - exciton detuning .",
