    "understanding the geometry and kinematics of the central regions in agn is one of the major goals of twenty - first century astronomy .",
    "yet little is known beyond the necessity of invoking accretion onto a supermassive object in order to account for the enormous source luminosity . given our inability to resolve the central regions of even the nearest agn",
    "we are left with three approaches towards achieving our goal : ( 1 ) ideology : sophisticated models driven entirely by theories describing black hole and associated accretion disk properties ( e.g. , janiuk , .",
    "zycki , & czerny 2000 ; gammie , shapiro , & mckinney 2004 ) , ( 2 ) analogy : comparison with better - resolved galactic objects ( e.g. interacting binary stars ; zamanov & marziani 2002 ; mirabel 2004 ; maccarone , gallo , & fender 2003 ) and ( 3 ) empiricism : detailed studies of phenomenology in large and diverse samples of agn ( see sulentic , marziani & dultzin - hacyan 2000a for references until late 1999 ; marziani et al .",
    "2003a , hereafter m03 ; dietrich et al . 2002 ; kuraszkiewicz et al .",
    "2004 for examples of more recent works ) .",
    "the last approach fell on hard times until the end of the twentieth century in part due to : ( i ) the apparent intractability of agn phenomenology , ( ii ) the failure of the best nebular physics models to reproduce the observed spectra , and ( iii ) the low quality of so much of the spectroscopic data .",
    "thus we now know more about the morphology of the extended radio and optical emission around quasars than the underlying geometry / physics that drives them .",
    "one positive development involves the application of reverberation mapping towards estimation of the broad line region size ( see peterson 1993 for a thorough review ; horne et al . , 2004 for up - to - date expectations ) .",
    "the relevant questions are how to interpret these data and , more importantly , how to select a representative sample of sources for a reverberation mapping study .",
    "another positive development involves growing databases of agn spectra ( most notably from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ; richards et al . 2002 ; schneider et al . 2002 ) .",
    "although great part of the individual data still suffers from s / n limitations , average or composite spectra of many objects can significantly improve the situation ( vanden berk et al .",
    "2001 ; sulentic et al .",
    "one of the most important questions is _ how _ to bin the data .",
    "clearly unrestricted composites have little value because they hide the intrinsic dispersion in key parameters which provides clues to the underlying physics ( e.g. , francis et al . 1991 ) . in a previous paper ( sulentic et al .",
    "2002 : hereafter paper i ) we argue that composite spectra binned within the eigenvector 1 parameter space provide the most physically useful results .",
    "paper i presented composites of the h@xmath4  spectral region and this paper presents complementary composites for the uv spectral region and especially for .",
    "we have identified a four dimensional parameter space that overcomes some of the problems mentioned above and that offers a new perspective on agn phenomenology ( sulentic et al .",
    "2000a , b ) .",
    "the eigenvector 1 ( e1 ) parameter space provides optimal discrimination / unification of broad - line agn classes ( boroson & green 1992 ; marziani et al .",
    "2001 , hereafter m01 ; boroson 2002 ) .",
    "the adopted name reflects recognition of the first two parameters in the pioneering work of boroson & green ( 1992 ) . e1",
    "as we now define it involves measures of :    1 .   full width at half maximum of low ionization ( lil ) broad emission lines [ fwhm ( ) ] , 2 .",
    "equivalent width ratio of optical feii and : = ew (  blend)/ew ( ) , 3 .",
    "soft x - ray photon index ( @xmath5 ) , 4 .",
    "profile centroid velocity displacement ( at fwhm ) for .    in simplest terms",
    "these parameters can be said to measure respectively : ( 1 ) velocity dispersion of lil emitting gas , ( 2 ) relative strength of lil features thought to arise in the same region , ( 3 ) strength of a soft x - ray component and ( 4 ) amplitude of systematic motions in the high - ionization line ( hil ) emitting gas . in less simple ( i.e. more model dependent ) terms",
    "we likely have : ( i ) two variables mainly sensitive to accretion rate ( fwhm ( ) and : nicastro 2000 ; m01 ; pounds , done & osborne 1995 ; czerny et al .",
    "2004 ) , ( ii ) three variables sensitive to source orientation ( all with the possible exclusion of ; e.g. , jackson & browne 1991 ; wills et al . 1995 ; marziani et al . 1996",

    "an important addition that reflects the striking changes in emission line properties across e1 involves introduction of the population a and b concept .",
    "at present we arbitrarily define pop .",
    "a and b quasars as those with fwhm  less than or greater than 4000 .",
    "it is unclear whether the a - b concept reflects two distinct quasar populations or simply the difference in mean properties of sources at opposite ends of the e1 `` main sequence '' .",
    "the `` elbow '' shape of the sequence , and optical / x - ray indications ( sulentic et al .",
    "2000a , b ; komossa & meerschweinchen 2000 ) for a `` zone of avoidance '' near fwhm ( ) @xmath2 4000 , provide some evidence in support of the former interpretation .",
    "if the distinction is real then `` a '' is a largely rq population ( including narrow line seyfert 1 sources as an extremum ) , while `` b '' contains a mix of broader line rq plus most rl sources .",
    "the population a - b distinction will prove useful in this study and  will add support for the concept (  3.2 and  4.3 ) .",
    "if the e1 concept lives up to initial promise , it may be the strongest and most encompassing type-1 agn unification yet discovered .",
    "this possibility warrants strong tests of its strength and generality .",
    "so far most of our effort has centered on the `` optical plane '' of e1 ( m01 ; zamanov et al .",
    "2002 ; boroson 2002 ; marziani et al .",
    "2003a , b ; sulentic et al . 2003 ) .",
    "this focus has been dictated by the available x - ray and uv archival data that provide the other e1 parameters . in the next section we present composite spectra for  ( and other uv lines ) in the e1 context which complements work already done for .",
    "a total of about 700 reasonable quality ( s / n @xmath8 45 ) hst spectra for n = 141 different agn ( quasars or bright seyfert 1 s ; n=61 are radio - loud with @xmath9 , where @xmath10  is the specific flux ratio between 4400   and 6 cm ) have been extracted from the hubble archive . the majority of the spectra ( 83 % ) were obtained with the fos camera and the rest with stis .",
    "the fos / bl data ( 40 % ) were recalibrated with the latest iraf package ",
    "stpoa , which takes into account some systematic errors in the wavelength calibration .",
    "no such recalibration is available for the fos / rd , where similar errors are known to exist , which ultimately limits the wavelength accuracy of our composites to about 0.51.0   ( see for instance kerber & rosa , 2000 , for details on fos calibration ) .",
    "composite spectra cover the entire rest frame region between 10003000   while individual source spectra will often cover only a part of it .",
    "we applied the following procedures to compute the composite spectra :    1 .",
    "spectra for a specific source covering the same spectral region were averaged together ( if they were of comparable s / n ) .",
    "a single spectrum for each object was created by adding the parts covering different wavelength regions , with slight adjustments of the continuum levels if necessary .",
    "all spectra were corrected for galactic extinction following schlegel et al .",
    "the typical extinction correction @xmath11 was about 0.1  0.2 magnitude .",
    "no correction for the intrinsic extinction was attempted .",
    "the spectra were de - redshifted using the most accurate available measurements ( m03 ) or by using the latest accurate values available in the literature whenever a source was not part of the m03 sample@xmath125007 or the narrow peak of h@xmath4 ( see zamanov et al .",
    "2002 ) ; they are available from the authors on request . ] .",
    "it should be noted that redshifts from vron - cetty & vron ( 2001 ) ; hereafter vcv01 , sometimes differ considerably from our best values ( @xmath13could be as large as 0.02 ) .",
    "spectra were normalized by their own continuum flux in the wavelength range 14301470  , where no strong lines are observed / expected .",
    "composite spectra were generated by median - combining the averaged spectra of individual agn .",
    "this procedure ensures that only the most typical features will be revealed , and that some unusual features like narrow absorption ( often lost in the noise ) , unusually strong ( narrow ) lines , noise spikes , etc .",
    "will be omitted in the composites .",
    "a median also works better than an average when the individual spectra do not cover the same spectral region ( see  4 for details regarding line profiles of the composites ) .",
    "the composites have been binned to 0.5   per resolution element and have a typical s / n@xmath350 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the composite spectra are presented in figure 1 with an enlargement of the 11002000   region of greatest interest shown in figure 2 .",
    "the latter show details of the strongest lines such as ly , , and .",
    "the lines that we identified and measured (  3.1 ) are labeled .",
    "we defined spectral types on the basis of source parameter properties in the optical plane of e1 ( paper i ) .",
    "this approach differs from the one employed in analysis of the sdss quasar sample ( richards et al .",
    "2002 ) where sources were binned _ a posteriori _ in terms of the velocity shift between  and .",
    "we are able to create useful composites for five e1 bins with fixed fwhm ( ) and  ranges , exactly as done in paper i. the values of fwhm ( ) and  that provide an optical bin assignment were taken from m03 . in order to maximize the number of sources in each bin we also include additional spectra for sources ( @xmath2 20%  of the total ) , not part of the m03 sample .",

    "figure 3 illustrates the deblending results for two particularly important groups of lines :  +  and  +  + .",
    "the first blend is important because  is the only high - ionization line that shows no significant baldwin effect ( sulentic et al .",
    "2000a , see also  4.5 ) .",
    "the importance of the second blend involves the fact that the intensity ratio /  may be sensitive to density ( n@xmath26 ) and/or may be affected by metallicity trends along e1 ( m01 ;  4.3 ) .",
    "we carried out a deblending procedure by assuming a lorentzian profile for both lines in the blend and allowing for different component intensities and fwhm .",

    "* we find a clear positive trend between fwhm and ionization potential ( @xmath28 ) for the principal broad lines .",
    "the correlation coefficients are in the range 0.60.8 .",
    "fwhm typically scales linearly with @xmath28 up to @xmath29 ev and saturates beyond that value .",
    "the scatter in this relation appears to be smaller for a - bins .",
    "b - bins suggest that some lil such as  and deviate from the relationship with larger than expected values of fwhm .",

    "we identified three reasonably unambiguous components in the context of e1 and the population a - b hypothesis .",
    "these identifications , and the adopted profile fits , are largely empirical at this stage .",

    "either gaussian or lorentzian fits to the broad  profiles of bin a1 , b1 and b1@xmath27  composites show a narrow residual . although one can not be sure that it is from an nlr component , that is the simplest interpretation and is empirically justified by many cases where nlr emission is unambiguously observed .",

    "the fits in figure 4 are consistent with a systematically increasing unshifted component as one proceeds from bin a3 to b1 .",

    "it is also important to point out that bin sizes were chosen to include sources that are statistically similar within the average parameter measurement errors .",
    "another important question is whether or not an ensemble of line profiles with a wide distribution of widths , strengths and asymmetries will yield a representative profile of the same type after combination .",
    "we see that the many of the lines ( especially the strongest ) are better fit by a lorentzian whatever that means physically .",
    "is it possible , for instance , that an ensemble of gaussian profiles will generate a lorentzian - like shape in composite spectra or the converse ?",
    "this might lead to incorrect interpretation , and hence modeling , of line - forming regions . in order to test this possibility we ran a simulation by combining together about 100 artificial line profiles with a wide ( normal ) distribution of widths and intensities , resembling the real situation to some extent .",
    "we performed simulation with both gaussian and lorentzian profiles , creating median and average composites from the individual pseudo - spectra .",

    "a reasonable guess for @xmath69 is about 0.10.2 .",
    "one can easily show that fwhm of  3000  implies a radius of about 5000 while 1000  implies  500 , values quite close to the size of the self - graviting region assumed above .",
    "even if the agreement is perhaps fortuitous , and the exact  dependence is far from certain , it is reasonable to conclude that  ( @xmath3 @xmath70 ) may be smaller in pop b sources by a factor @xmath71 , and that this may leave a very `` small '' emitting surface for any standard optically - thick geometrically - thin disk component .",
    "part of the line profile may be produced in the disk if it is illuminated by a geometrically thick inner region or by disk warping ( e.g. bachev , 1999 ) and if it is not extremely hot ( which would completely ionize the lower - ionization species ) .",
    "on the other hand , the presence of a blue - shifted component can be most simply explained as the signature of an outflow from an optically thick disk .",
    "the disk - wind scenario can produce blue - shifted high - ionization lines as already suggested in several works ( e. g. murray & chiang 1997 ; bottorff et al .",

    "the overall shape of a line arising in a disk wind will be less dependent on the radial distance where the wind originates .",

    "+ an alternative approach is to ascribe the entire profile of civ in a2/a3 bins to an outflow ( wind ) . in such a case the redward emission is seen either because the disk is ( partially ) transparent to civ photons or because of higher inclinations , resulting in significant projection of the keplerian / radial component of the wind velocity onto the line of sight .",

    "a sources can be explained with a split blr : inner hil and an outer lil emitting regions .",
    "since we expect that gas motion will retain its circular velocity in the wind and will acquire an upward and outward velocity component , the velocity dispersion in the wind will be higher than for a keplerian velocity component in the disk .",
    "lil emission from the outer , fragmented region will therefore be narrower . in pop b sources we expect a `` normal '' blr stratification : hil emitted closer to the central continuum source than lil .",

    "limited sample , where @xmath92 and @xmath19are highly correlated , an `` evolutionary '' ( redshift - dependent ) baldwin effect is expected and is indeed found in the large bright quasar survey ( green et al .",
    "2001 ) . given a sample that is complete in terms of @xmath91 ,",
    "the be may survive with even larger scatter or disappear depending on the relative importance of evolutionary and selection effects ( see dietrich et al .",
    "deeper surveys may detect larger ew ( ) sources at high redshift : see for example the distribution of ew ( ) at @xmath93 in constantin et al .",
    "intriguingly , they detect several sources with ew()@xmath2550  at @xmath94 .",
    "interpretation of the be has been highly controversial with suggestions encompassing orientation effects ( netzer 1985 ) , selection effects ( sulentic et al . 2000a , and references therein ) , black hole mass ( wandel 1999 ; warner et al . 2003 ) , eddington ratio ( sulentic et al .",
    "2000a , shang et al . 2003 ; baskin & laor 2004 ) . a continuum softening with increasing luminosity ( wandel 1999 ) is a less model - dependent explanation .",
    "warner et al . ( 2003 ) suggest that the driving parameter may be the central black hole mass .",
    "these authors computed the bh mass using a modified kaspi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) relation , employing fwhm  instead of fwhm  and assuming virial motions .",
    "this _ does not demonstrate _ that mass is driving the be because it is assumed to be @xmath95 , and this assumption makes the computation in part circular .",
    "furthermore , we question the validity of estimating bh masses using  ( e.g. vestergaard 2002 and warner et al . 2003 ; 2004 ) . while  shows average broad line profiles that can be argued to arise in virialized clouds ,",
    "is blue asymmetric and blue shifted in about 60%  of sources . in many cases",
    "the shift is significant and in some  virtually all of the line flux",
    "is displaced to the blue side of the local rest frame .",
    "it is not at all clear that the clouds ( or wind ? ) producing the hil emission can be assumed to be virialized .",
    "finally failure to correct for nlr emission in the civ profile will contribute to the dispersion in bh mass that might be present .",
    "nlr emission tends to decrease the dispersion blr fwhm measures ( fwhm measures for pop .",
    "b become more like pop a ) .",
    "figure 5 shows that nlr uncorrected fwhm civ measures will underestimate bh mass and overestimate @xmath96 values for rl sources .",
    "our work shows that a  exists in , at least , pop .",
    "b sources and that a significant part ( if not all ) of  emission in bins a2/a3 arises in a wind",
    ". the terminal wind velocity could be only indirectly related to keplerian ( i.e. virialized ) motions .",
    "the overall velocity dispersion is even less likely to be related to virial motion in near face - on sources , where the accretion disk likely obscures the receding part of the flow .",
    "the  line profile in such cases is almost fully blueshifted with respect to the rest frame . while any correlation with mass will be little affected over several orders of magnitude ( warner et al .",
    "2003 ) , any more fundamental correlation with @xmath91 may be entirely washed out ( @xmath91  range is a factor @xmath4150 ; woo & urry 2002 ) . comparing fwhm h@xmath4 and civ in different spectral bins ( pop .",
    "b with and without  subtraction ) suggests that errors could be at least a factor @xmath310 for some objects ( since , for example , the fwhm ratio  is @xmath2 3 in izw1 ; marziani et al . 1996 ; 2003b ) .",
    "however , a shallow trend between ew ( ) and @xmath97  is noted in a large sample of quasars of redshift @xmath98 ( warner et al .",
    "2004 ) , which seems to support our results for @xmath990.8 .",
    "another circumstantial element supporting a role for the accretion rate @xmath91 in the be involves the constancy of ew ( ) and the increasing intensity ratio /   along the sequence from b1@xmath27 to a3 .",
    "the large values of ew ( ) for all spectral types are suggestive of solar or supersolar metallicity ( turner et al .",
    "2003 ; bentz & osmer 2004 ) .",
    "it is not unreasonable to suppose that n may have been enhanced by vigorous formation of massive stars that burn h via the cno cycle in the agn circumnuclear regions .",
    "the largest enrichment may have occurred in relatively young or rejuvenated quasars radiating at large accretion rates as nlsy1s are thought to be ( several nlsy1s hosts may be merging dwarf or barred galaxies ; krongold et al .",
    "2001 ; crenshaw et al .",
    "we computed and analyzed composite uv spectra for 5 different spectral bins along the main sequence of the e1 optical parameter plane .",
    "data were analyzed following paper i , which considered similar composite spectra for the optical region involving , our representative lil .",
    "we measured the fwhm and equivalent width of a number of emission lines focussing on , our representative hil .",
    "our main results include :    * we decompose hil  into possible nlr , blr and vblr components many of which have lil analogs .",
    "we consider them to be distinct line emitting regions .",
    "type 2 agn show only nlr lil and hil emission .",
    "type 1 agn are know with pure blr , pure vblr and , most often , composite blr+vblr ( with and without nlr ) spectra if they belong to population b. a strong asymmetric blueshifted blr hil component is unique to population a ( bins a2/a3 ) sources .",
    "a reasonably strong and redshifted vblr is unique to hil and lil in population b ( bins b1 and b1@xmath27 ) sources .",
    "* we infer a  trend along the e1 sequence using the ratio of the semi - forbidden lines  and . under the assumption of a nearly constant chemical abundance along e1",
    ", we find that density increases by about an order of magnitude between bins b1@xmath27  and a3 . however , there are indications that both  density and metallicity may increase from extreme b - bins to extreme a - bins .",
    "* we compare sub - samples of rl and rq sources in bin b1 .",
    "we find an excess of nlr and redshifted broad line emission in the rl subsample",
    ". the former represents virtual proof that nlr line emission is present in the spectra of many type 1 agn .",
    "* we advance the following empirically driven model for the structure of the accretion flow : 1 .",
    "an inner hot optically thin ( possibly adaf ) disk , located inside @xmath100 .",
    "2 .   a standard thin disk , between @xmath101 and @xmath102 , producing most of the optical continuum .",
    "this is the place where a wind may originate and produce the blue - shifted  component .",
    "an outer self - gravitating region at @xmath103 , producing most of the broad - line emission .",
    "+ @xmath101 and @xmath102 are functions of the accretion parameters",
    ". a n eventual discontinuity in their behavior as functions of m and m may account for the existence of different quasar populations ( e.g. pop .",
    "* we suggest that the eddington ratio is the primary driver of the baldwin effect rather than source luminosity .",
    "this suggestion is motivated by the robust be that we find in e1 which is luminosity independent .",
    "this explains why high redshift sources might preferentially show low ew and blueshifted  if pop .",
    "a sources are the `` seed '' ( i.e. youngest high accreting lowest mass bh ) agn .",
    "this interpretation is supported by comparison of our low redshift sample with first results from higher redshift sdss quasars .",
    "the latter show an increase in the fraction of sources with a blueshifted   hil  a defining characteristic of pop . a agn .",

    "<S> the simplest  decomposition into narrow ( nlr ) , broad ( blr ) and very broad ( vblr ) components suggests that different components have an analog in  with two major exceptions . </S>",

    "<S> the blueshifted component is thought to arise in a high ionization wind or outflow . </S>",

    "<S> we propose a model to account for several differences between low- and high - ionization line profiles . </S>",
    "<S> part of the broad line emission is attributed to a self - gravitating / fragmented region in an accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> an inner optically thick geometrically thin region of the flow may give rise to a wind / outflow and produce the blueshifted hil spectrum in pop . a sources . </S>",
    "<S> the fragmented region may produce all or most of the broad line emission in population b , which contains radio - quiet and the majority of radio - loud quasars . </S>",

    "<S> clear evidence is found for a significant nlr civ component in most radio - loud sources . </S>",
    "<S> the blr / vblr similarity in bin b1 provides circumstantial evidence in favor of black hole ( bh ) spin , rather than bh mass or accretion rate , as a key trigger in determining whether an object will be rl or rq . </S>",
