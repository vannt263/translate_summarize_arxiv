    "the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) is an extremely successful theory , which describes the properties of all known elementary particles , notably also the characteristics of the higgs boson .",
    "nevertheless , the cosmology requires also the existence of the dark matter ( dm ) , which can not be built out of the fields included in the sm , therefore this is the major motivation to explore its extensions .    in this paper",
    "we study a model of a higgs portal with a complex scalar field responsible for the mass generation of an abelian vector dark matter .",
    "we check , if it can explain the value of the dm relic abundance obtained from the measurements of the planck satellite and fulfill constraints coming from colliders and dm direct detection experiments .",
    "we also consider the  issue of the vacuum stability and discuss whether the metastability of the scalar potential , which is a feature of the sm @xcite , can be avoided in the extended framework . in particular , we present the modifications to the issue of stability due to the existence of the vector dark matter .",
    "the model of vector dark matter ( vdm ) is an extension of the sm with a complex scalar field @xmath0 that is charged under an extra @xmath1 gauge factor and has nonzero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xcite .",
    "consequently , an extra massive gauge boson appears in the theory , which can be a dm candidate , provided it is stable .",
    "this can be ensured by imposing @xmath2 symmetry on the @xmath1 boson @xmath3 with the following transformation rules : a^_x -a^_x  ,  ss^ * ,    s = e^i ,  so  ,   - .",
    "[ symmetry ] as a result the kinetic mixing of @xmath1 and the sm hypercharge @xmath4 is forbidden , whereas the @xmath4 & @xmath5 gauge bosons mix as in the sm .",
    "the masses of vectors are given by : m_w = gv/2 ,  m_z = v/2    = , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are vevs of @xmath8 and @xmath0 respectively and @xmath9 is the @xmath1 gauge coupling . the scalar potential in this model can be written as v= -^2_h|h|^2 + _ h |h|^4 -^2_s|s|^2 + _ s |s|^4 + |s|^2|h|^2 . [ potential ]",
    "it has three positivity conditions which are imposed in further discussions : _",
    "h > 0 ,  _ s > 0 ,  > -2 .",
    "[ positivity ]    the mass squared matrix @xmath10 for the fluctuations @xmath11 of the scalar fields around vevs can be diagonalized via rotation by a mixing angle @xmath12 @xmath13 we chose the convention in which @xmath14 is the observed higgs particle .",
    "the  potential has 5 parameters , but using the constraints @xmath15  gev and @xmath16  gev , we can eliminate two of them and , including @xmath9 , use four independent parameters ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath9 ) to describe the model .",
    "in order to check the stability and perturbativity conditions we adopted the renormalisation group equations ( rge ) . there is a large quantitative difference in the running of parameters between 1- and 2-loop levels .",
    "therefore , we used more accurate 2-loop approximation .",
    "it was obtained with the help of the sarahsoftware @xcite and cross - checked using pyrate@xcite .",
    "the stability of the vacuum was analysed by checking the positivity conditions for quartic couplings ( [ positivity ] ) , running with energy up to the planck scale .",
    "the beta function of @xmath18 was found to be always positive , therefore only two of those conditions are non - trivial ( fig .",
    "[ posplots ] ) .",
    "the possibility to alleviate the problem of vacuum stability , in this model , comes mainly from the extra freedom ( that is not present in the sm ) to choose parameters of the extended scalar potential .",
    "if @xmath20 at low energy scale is large enough , then @xmath17 is positive at all scales even if low initial values were chosen .",
    "however for @xmath21 , the third condition requires @xmath22 to be larger .",
    "the stability regions grows for medium values of @xmath9 and diminishes for large , but only moderately , as this coupling is present exclusively in the beta function of @xmath18 and affects the running of others indirectly .     at which the first ( upper panel ) or the third ( lower panel ) of the positivity conditions ( [ positivity ] ) is violated . in the grey areas quartic couplings become non - perturbative below the planck scale .",

    "properties of the higgs within the vdm model agree with those of the sm , however some variation within the limits of experimental and theoretical uncertainties is allowed . here",
    "there is a factor ( @xmath23 ) that equally suppresses all the couplings of the observed higgs .",
    "it is constrained by the global signal strength @xmath24 .",
    "the recent combined analysis of the atlas and cms data @xcite gives a following value of @xmath24 and resulting limit on @xmath25 @xmath26 in the mass range @xmath27 stronger bounds come from the higgs production process @xmath28 at lep . finally measurements of atlas restricts the invisible higgs branching ratio to values @xmath29 at @xmath30 cl @xcite .",
    "the branching ratio @xmath31 dominate the higgs decays , unless respective couplings @xmath9 or @xmath19 are tiny .",
    "consequently we exclude regions in the parameter space , where these decays are kinematically allowed .",
    "we assume that the dark matter was thermally produced in the early universe and compute its relic abundance with the use of micromegas@xcite .",
    "dark matter - nucleon scattering is mediated by higgs particles and their mass - degeneracy leads to destructive interference in the cross section = ^2 g_hnn^2 ^2 2 ( m_h_1 ^ -2-m_h_2 ^ -2)^2 , where @xmath32 is the reduced mass and @xmath33 is the effective higgs to nucleon coupling @xcite .",
    "we performed a scan in the parameter space and found points that are within @xmath34 limit from the planck value @xcite of the relic abundance @xmath35 and satisfy all the collider constraints ( fig .",
    "[ dd - mass ] ) .",
    "it is worth to mention , that it is possible to extend the single vdm scenario discussed so far to a multi - component dark matter model .",
    "it can be done by adding an extra dark matter field @xmath36 charged under @xmath1 ( and neutral under sm symmetries ) , which couples minimally to @xmath37 .",
    "the vector boson remains stable , if the decay into @xmath38 is kinematically forbidden ( @xmath39 ) , whereas other decays of @xmath37 and  @xmath36 are disallowed by the symmetry  ( [ symmetry ] ) and conservation of @xmath36 charge .",
    "if  the second dm candidate is a fermion , its majorana mass can be generated via term @xmath40 provided its charge equals @xmath41 of the scalar  @xmath0 charge .",
    "the field @xmath36 communicates with the sm mainly via @xmath0 .",
    "details of the model will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "the vector dark matter model is a theory , which can explain the observed dm relic abundance .",
    "it leads to the attractive prediction of the second higgs boson and allows to alleviate the problem of the vacuum stability .",
    "this model can be further tested by sensitive dm direct detection experiments and at lhc by refined measurements of the higgs or searches for other scalars .",
    "a  two - component extension of the model is possible .",
