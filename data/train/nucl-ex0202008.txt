    "the @xmath0 meson has the interesting feature that all its possible strong decays are forbidden in lowest order : @xmath5 and @xmath6 by @xmath7 and @xmath4 invariance , @xmath8 because of @xmath9-parity conservation as well as isospin and charge symmetry invariance .",
    "first order electromagnetic @xmath0 decays are forbidden as well : @xmath10 by conservation of angular momentum , @xmath11 and @xmath12 by _ c _ invariance .",
    "only @xmath13 occurs , but at a suppressed rate because it involves the anomaly .",
    "the first allowed decay is the second - order electromagnetic transition @xmath14 .",
    "the width of the @xmath0 is about 1.3 kev ; this is 5 orders of magnitude smaller than a typical strong decay , such as the @xmath15 meson .",
    "this feature makes @xmath0 decays @xmath16 times more sensitive than @xmath15 or @xmath17 decays at a comparable branching ratio for testing invariances .",
    "the physical @xmath0 is a mixture of the pseudoscalar su(3 ) octet ( @xmath18 ) and singlet ( @xmath19 ) parametrized by the mixing angle @xmath20 : @xmath21 the value for @xmath20 is @xmath22 .",
    "if we choose @xmath23 , we have the following remarkable makeup of the physical @xmath0 : @xmath24 which means that the @xmath0 is an eigenstate of the @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 operators of su(3 ) .",
    "we also have @xmath28 . in the limit @xmath29",
    ", we have @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath31 is an eigenstate of the operator that interchanges the @xmath32 and the @xmath33 quarks .",
    "there are more than 14 different neutral @xmath0 decays ( see table  [ tab : alldecays ] at the end ) .",
    "they make up ( 71.6 @xmath34 0.4)% of all @xmath0 decays  @xcite .",
    "the largest branching ratio of the @xmath0 is into two photons : @xmath35 it was measured in a dedicated experiment  @xcite carried out at saclay with the spes ii @xmath0  factory \" using the @xmath36he@xmath0 production reaction .",
