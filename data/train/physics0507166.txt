    "when matter is exposed to intense laser fields , high harmonics ( hhs ) of the incident radiation may be produced .",
    "usually , only odd harmonics are obtained even when the laser pulses are short ( for theoretical and experimental work which demonstrates this see @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "since the duration of the pulse in time is inversely proportional to its width in energy space , one may find this result surprising , as one may expect to obtain also a large distribution of frequencies in the scattered field .",
    "why are only odd harmonics obtained even when the laser pulses are short ?    for cw lasers ( and symmetric field - free potential ) using the non - hermitian floquet theory it was proved that only odd harmonics are obtained when the dynamics is controlled by a single resonance floquet quasienergy ( qe ) state @xcite,@xcite .",
    "when laser pulses are used it was argued that this proof holds since usually the populated resonance states are associated with very different lifetimes and the dynamics is controlled by the resonance state which has the longest lifetime . however , this argument may hold only when the duration of the laser pulses is large enough to enable the decay of the short lived resonances .",
    "indeed numerical simulations showed that the harmonic generation spectra ( hgs ) as obtained from a single non - hermitian ( complex scaled ) resonance floquet state is in a remarkable agreement with the results obtained from conventional ( i.e. , hermitian ) time dependent simulation @xcite .",
    "the question that is addressed in this work is weather an analytical criteria for the shape and duration of the laser pulse for which the system is controlled by a single resonance floquet state can be given .",
    "it is obvious that the question regarding the possibility of population of a single resonance state is connected with the question regarding the degree of adiabaticity of the process .",
    "the question is therefore under which conditions can a short laser pulse be defined as adiabatic one .",
    "the answer to this question is important not only to harmonic generation ( hg ) studies but also for other , more general studies where lasers are used to control the dynamics , for example adiabatic stirap procedures @xcite .    in order to answer this question we use the ( t , t ) formalism @xcite together with the non - hermitian quantum mechanics ( nhqm ) formalism .",
    "the use of nhqm formalism to describe the dynamics of atoms / molecules subjected to cw laser fields is essential , since only then can the dynamics be described in terms physical , square integrable , resonance floquet states .",
    "otherwise , the description of the dynamics in terms of hermitian floquet states results in very little physical insight on the problem , as well as numerical problems , not to mention that it is limited to the description of bound systems only . in the hermitian case",
    "the spectrum is continuous and becomes discrete only due to the use of finite box quantization ; moreover , a single floquet state in hermitian qm can not describe neither the resonance phenomena nor the field ionization phenomena @xcite .",
    "our strategy is as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a brief review of the formalism used in our derivation [ namely the ( t , t ) formalism for hermitian and non - hermitian hamiltonians ] . in section 3",
    "we introduce the new derivation of the adiabatic theorem for open quantum systems in strong laser pulses . in section 4",
    "we apply the adiabatic theorem as derived in section 3 to a test - case model hamiltonian which describes a 1d xe atom subjected to a sin - square pulse of monochromatic laser . in section 4",
    "we conclude .",
    "the ( t , t ) formalism enables one to obtain analytical solutions for any time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) with time - dependent hamiltonians .",
    "the formalism rests on lifting of the tdse to an extended hilbert space , propagation of the wavefunction there and finally projecting back to the physical hilbert space .",
    "the solution of a general tdse is given as usual by :    @xmath0    with the initial condition @xmath1 and the vector operator @xmath2 describes the internal degrees of freedom .",
    "it has been shown by peskin and moiseyev that by regarding time as an extra coordinate @xmath3 , one can obtain another schrdinger equation with a time independent hamiltonian in the extended hilbert space @xmath4 , whose solution @xmath5 has an analytical time dependence ( given by the analytical time evolution operator associated with time - independent hamiltonians ) @xcite .",
    "our desired wavfunction @xmath6 can be deduced from this wavfunction by a simple operation ( that will be shown later ) .",
    "the advantage is that efficient propagation schemes designed for solving the tdse with time - independent hamiltonians could then be used also for time dependent hamiltonians , thus releasing one from the difficulties associated with time ordering .",
    "let us define the following floquet - type operator    @xmath7    where @xmath3 should be regarded as a * coordinate * and @xmath8 is the final time of propagation .",
    "when the hamiltonian @xmath9 is time periodic with period @xmath10 , the operator is the floquet operator and @xmath11 .",
    "provided that correct boundary conditions are chosen for the @xmath3 coordinate , this operator is hermitian since it is the sum of two hermitian operators .",
    "this operator has eigenstates and eigenvalues which are given by the eigenvalue equation :    @xmath12    and the set of eigenstates is complete in the extended hilbert space @xmath4 with respect to the inner product    @xmath13    say the following tdse with time - independent hamiltonian need to be solved with the initial state @xmath14 :    @xmath15    using the definition of @xmath16 this equation reads    @xmath17    by setting the cut @xmath18 on eq.[eq6 ] one gets :    @xmath19|_{t'=t}=h(\\mathbf{r},t ) [ \\overline{\\psi}(\\mathbf{r},t',t)|_{t'=t}]=i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t } [ \\overline{\\psi}(\\mathbf{r},t',t)|_{t'=t}]\\label{eq7}\\ ] ]    where the following property    @xmath20= [ ( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t ' } ) \\overline{\\psi}(\\mathbf{r},t',t)]|_{t'=t}\\label{eq8}\\ ] ]    ( which holds true for * any * function of @xmath3 and @xmath21 .",
    "the relation between the solution of eq.[eq7 ] and the solution of the original tdse ( eq.[eq1 ] ) is given by    @xmath22    provided that these two differential equations have the same initial condition .",
    "hence ,    @xmath23    it is seen from eq.[eq10 ] that apparently the initial condition is nt unique .",
    "while this holds true in case that one is interested only in the physical wavefunction @xmath6 , it should be noted that if one wishes to calculate physical quantities in the extended hilbert space using the function @xmath5 and then go back to the original hilbert space , and get the correct results , the initial condition in the extended hilbert space should behaves as a delta - function in @xmath3 .",
    "the correct initial condition will therefore be @xmath24 .",
    "the main advantage of the ( t , t ) formalism from a numerical point of view is that it enables the use of an analytical expression for the time evolution operator , without the necessity of time ordering , even when the hamiltonian is strongly time - dependent .",
    "any tdse with time - dependent hamiltonian could be replaced by a different tdse , with time - independent hamiltonian , for which a greater number of accurate integration schemes exist and the solution is given formally by @xmath25 ) .",
    "the price one pays however is that the new tdse need to be integrated over one more dimension .",
    "the main advantage of the _ ( t , t ) _ formalism from a conceptional point of view is that it enables to describe any time - dependent dynamics in terms of stationary eigenstates and eigenvalues .",
    "so far the derivation has been carried out within the framework of the conventional ( i.e. , hermitian ) quantum mechanics . using the complex - scaling ( cs ) transformation",

    "however , as proposed recently by moiseyev and lein ( @xcite ) , the inner - product should be modified even further when time - dependent functions are used as basis set due to the time - asymmetry problem in nhqm .",

    "the `` bra '' ( left ) solution is not a solution of a schrdinger equation but is derived from the `` ket '' solution ( the explanation of this point is beyond the scope of this work ; for an explanation see @xcite )    @xmath175    and also this function decays with time . when the f - product of @xmath176 and @xmath177 is calculated ( this is an overlap integral without complex conjugation of the left state ; in the usual dirac - product notation this reads @xmath178 ) the terms containing the real part of the energy cancel each other and the overlap integral ( c - product ) of the adiabatic floquet states gives unity ( remember the completeness property of floquet states also in coordinate space alone ) . the expression in eq.[eq63 ]",
    "is obtained for the specific case that only the floquet resonance state which is `` born '' from the field - free bound state is populated .",
    "when several floquet states are populated the same type of calculation could be repeated , where this time @xmath176 and @xmath177 are given by liner combination of terms as in eq.[eq64 ] with the proper coefficients .",
    "since the adiabatic floquet states are orthogonal to each other , a generalization of the result of eq.[eq63 ] is obtained :    @xmath179    notice that in the non - hermitian formalism the norm is not conserved but decays with time ; it contains the knowledge about decay processes inherently .",
    "the two functions as given in eq.[eq59],[eq63 ] were compared and it was found that the resemblance between the functions increased as the adiabatic limit was increasingly reached by the laser pulse parameters .    the numerical method used to solve the tdse with hermitian hamiltonian was the split operator forest - ruth algorithm with 7 points @xcite ; the grid size , time step and/or grid step were adjusted as required to achieve convergence . for the non - hermitian floquet simulation , the ( t , t ) formalism was used , with the complex coordinate method .",
    "the number of basis functions , box length and scaling angle were adjusted as required to achieve convergence .    in fig.[fig1 ]",
    "the hgs as obtained for pulse strength of @xmath180 ( corresponding to intensity of @xmath181 ) , pulse - durations of @xmath182 optical cycles , laser frequencies of @xmath183 ( corresponding to energies of @xmath184 and wavelengths of @xmath185 , @xmath186 , respectively ) and initial state @xmath187 are shown .",
    "the appearance of odd harmonics and the absence of even or non - integer harmonics , is in general the main feature which appears for long pulses , regardless of the frequency .",
    "the odd harmonics are obtained even for the shortest laser pulses although the existence of odd - symmetry selection rules is sensitive to the frequency : some deviation appears at frequency of @xmath188 and the obtained spectra is more complicated .    in fig.[fig2 ] the complex quasienergies of the 3 resonances which are `` born '' from the 3 bound states of the field - free hamiltonian ( will be given indices 1 - 3 from now on ) , as obtained from adiabatic floquet simulations ( eq.[eq49 ] ) for @xmath189 are shown as function of the cw - field strength @xmath75 .",
    "notice that the lifetimes of these resonances are not monotonic functions of the field intensity .",
    "it should be noted that these were not the only resonances that appeared in the quasienergy spectrum ; there were also other resonances which did nt emerge from the field - free bound states .",
    "however , as will be shown in fig.[fig4 ] , in this case for not too large field intensities resonances 1 - 3 were the only important resonances and they alone determined the dynamical behavior of the system .    in fig.[fig3 ] the ionization probability as obtained from the hermitian simulation ( eq.[eq59 ] ) with pulse strength of @xmath180 , pulse - durations of @xmath182 optical cycles , laser frequency of @xmath189 and initial state @xmath187 ,",
    "is compared to the ionization probability as obtained from the expression given in eq.[eq63 ] , which is derived from the f - product formalism together with the resonances quasienergies obtained from the non - hermitian simulation .",
    "it is seen that as the pulse becomes longer the results obtained from the two simulations become identical .",
    "both results of hgs and ionization probabilities showed that the time - dependent wavefunction of the studied systems could be well approximated by the adiabatic expression given in eq.[eq54 ] , even for short pulses .",
    "the values of the terms which check the adiabatic criteria , as seen in fig.[fig6 ] , gave the explanation why this was so .    in fig.[fig4 ]",
    "the expressions @xmath190 ( eq.[eq44 ] ) which describe the couplings between every two resonances from the set of 3 tracked resonances is shown as function of the cw - field strength @xmath75 , for the case @xmath189 .",
    "it can be seen that the coupling between resonances 1 and 2 is strong for field strength of @xmath191 , @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",
    "this could be partially explained on the basis of the values of the quasienergies , as seen in fig.[fig2 ] , at least for two field strengths out of the three .",
    "it is seen that for field strength of @xmath194 and @xmath192 the real parts of the quasienergies cross , resulting in small value of the denominator in the expression given in eq.[eq45 ] for @xmath195 ( at least for one @xmath101 term ) .",
    "in the same way the strong couplings between resonances 1 and 3 at field strength of @xmath196 , and between resonances 2 and 3 at field strength of @xmath197 could be explained on the basis of the quasienergy values at these field - strengths .",
    "in particular it should be noticed that the couplings between resonances 1 and 3 at @xmath196 are the strongest among all 3 resonances due to the close values of both real and imaginary parts of the quasienergies .",
    "however , it should be noted that crossings in the quaisenergy plot are not always indications of large couplings since also the overlap between the wavefunctions ( the nominator of the expression for @xmath198 ) is important .    in fig.[fig5 ] the sum @xmath199 which describes the couplings between * all * quasistates of the system @xmath200 to resonance 1 @xmath201 is shown as function of the cw - field strength @xmath75 , for the case @xmath189 .",
    "in addition , also the partial sum @xmath202 which describes the couplings between resonances 2 and 3 to the resonance state @xmath201 is shown .",
    "it can be shown that up to a moderate intensity of @xmath203 the first resonance is mainly coupled only to the other 2 resonances and not to other , higher resonances or continuum states .",
    "the entire dynamics is governed almost solely by the 3 resonances which are `` born '' from the 3 bound states of the field - free hamiltonian .",
    "the sums described above , which are functions of a cw - field strength @xmath75 , are converted to be explicit functions of time for the specific sine - square pulse with maximal intensity @xmath180 used in the simulation ( fig.[fig5 ] , upper part ) .",
    "for this purpose for each time @xmath21 @xmath159 the effective cw - field strength @xmath204 is calculated and the values of the 2 functions shown in fig.[fig5 ] which fit this effective cw - field strength are taken . hence the 2 sum functions are converted to be explicit functions of time . in the middle part of fig.[fig6 ] the full term @xmath205 , which represents the degree of adiabaticity in the process of shining a 1d xe atom initially at the ground state with a sine - square laser pulse supporting @xmath206 optical cycles of monochromatic radiation with frequency @xmath189 and strength @xmath180 , is shown as function of time .",
    "it is seen that the term @xmath205 is bounded by the value of @xmath207 for all times , whether it is calculated by coupling of the first resonance to other 2 resonances only or to all other states .",
    "the structure of the hhs for @xmath206 seen in fig.[fig1 ] implies that this value is indeed small and the process is adiabatic .",
    "in the lower part of fig.[fig6 ] the same quantity is shown , but for @xmath188 . here",
    "it is seen the terms @xmath205 are bounded by a much larger value of @xmath208 for all times and the more complex structure of the hhs for @xmath206 seen in fig.[fig1 ] implies that this value is not small enough to indicate the appearance of an adiabatic process .",
    "it should be noted that for a given system with field - strength @xmath51 , frequency @xmath53 and sine - square pulse envelope , we have @xmath209 .",
    "therefore , as the number of optical cycles the pulse supports increases the general shape of the terms @xmath205 is kept the same but is attenuated .",
    "therefore , for @xmath188 as @xmath160 gets bigger , the pulse s envelope varies more slowly and the process becomes more and more adiabatic , as seen in the hhs spectra for @xmath210 for example .",
    "with the help of the ( t , t ) formalism we derive an adiabatic theorem for open systems . the use of the complex scaling transformation plays a key role in our derivation .",
    "for example , the spectrum of the floquet hamiltonian of an open system is changed dramatically . rather than a continuous spectrum that is responsible for the absence of an adiabatic limit for @xmath160(number of basis functions)@xmath211 in the conventional qm ,",
    "the resonances are associated with a point spectrum and are separated from the continuum which is rotated into the lower half of the complex energy plane .",
    "an interesting important numerical result of our derivation is that the calculation of the effect of the pulses s shape on the dynamics does not require heavy computations .",
    "the entire effect of the laser pulse is embedded in a multiplication factor of @xmath212 where @xmath213 is the variation of the maximum field amplitude as function of time .    as a numerical example we applied the adiabatic theorem we derived to a model hamiltonian of xe atom ( with symmetric field - free potential ) which interacts with strong , monochromatic laser pulses .",
    "we have shown that the generation of odd - order harmonics and the absence of even - order harmonics , even when the pulses are extremely short , can be explained with the help of the adiabatic theorem we derived .",
    "the use of a single - electron 1d model to describe a realistic atom is justified since it has been shown before in many cases that all the main strong field effects are reproduced . therefore the conclusions obtained with this model are also valid for a realistic atom .",
