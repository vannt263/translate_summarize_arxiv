    "models with extra dimensions have become intensively studied in the last few years , not only in string theory but in many other extensions of the standard model .",
    "branes have played a major role on many of these models and have therefore been studied from several different perspectives @xcite . some of these branes have a description in terms of solitons in the low energy theories as either domain walls @xcite , strings @xcite , monopoles @xcite , or even higher codimension objects @xcite .",
    "one of the earliest models of particle physics to incorporate solitons to its spectrum , the skyrme model @xcite , has so far not been investigated in connection to the braneworld scenarios .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to study braneworld models based on the higher dimensional generalization of the einstein - skyrme model .",
    "one of the most interesting properties of the skyrme model that makes it different from all the other topological defects mentioned above , is the presence of higher order corrections to the kinetic term .",
    "recently there has been several studies on topological defects with non - canonical kinetic terms @xcite .",
    "most of those models have been focusing on the differences introduced in the soliton solutions by the new term in the lagrangian . on the other hand",
    ", our model does not have a potential term in contrast to all the other cases studied in the literature of braneworld scenarios .",
    "furthermore , in the absence of the skyrme term , the theory does not present any smooth stable configuration even though there is a topological charge that one can define .",
    "it is only because of this new term that one is able to have a finite size stable configuration avoiding in this way the straighforward extension of derrick s theorem @xcite .",
    "it is then clear that the higher order terms in our lagrangian are crucial for the solutions presented here and are not just a small correction to the model .",
    "on the other hand , the particular structure of the theory that we study here gives rise to solitonic solutions that are very much localized in the transverse directions .",
    "this property makes them good candicates to describe a smooth version of extended solutions previously studied only in the their thin wall limit .",
    "in fact , we will show that our thick brane solutions in the einstein - skyrme model asymptotically match the higher dimensional vacuum solutions of the pure einstein s equations previously found in @xcite .",

    "we will also restrict ourselves to the four dimensional flat brane solutions . taking these constraints into account",
    "we can now write the most general metric of this form in the _ isotropic gauge _ as ,    @xmath15    where @xmath16 .",
    "we also impose the hedgehog ansatz for the chiral field , which is the natural spherically symmetric ansatz for skyrme model ; that is , we assume the following form for @xmath17 , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the profile function to be solved for and @xmath20 with @xmath21 , are the pauli matrices .    within this ansatz ,",

    "it is likely that a similar situation may arise in our higher dimensional case .",
    "as we discussed in the introduction , our brane solutions have the same symmetry as the cosmic 3-brane gravity solutions discussed by gregory @xcite .",
    "furthermore our branes are not charged with respect to any long range field , and therefore their energy momentum tensor is very well localized .",
    "it is then tempting to identify our solutions with the smooth out version of the cosmic 3-brane examples .",

    "we give in table 1 the results obtained for this parameter in our numerical examples .",
    "note that our numerical solutions are smooth everywhere contrary to the analytic expressions in eq.([3-brane - isotropic ] ) that have naked singularities located at @xmath79 and at @xmath80 . on the other hand",
    ", we will show that the analytic solutions are in fact a good approximation to our numerical results in the asymptotic region where @xmath81 but start deviating from them as @xmath82 . in order to see this ,",

    "the function @xmath62 and @xmath63 and compare them with the same functions in the numerical calculations .",
    "as we see the asymptotic form of the two functions , the numerical ones and the analytic vacuum solutions , are in perfect agreement so we conclude that our numerical solutions do , in fact , match their thin wall counterparts .",
    "we have constructed , using numerical techniques , static 3-brane solitonic solutions in the @xmath0 skyrme model coupled to gravity .",
    "we have shown that their asymptotic form can be well approximated by the analytic vacuum solutions of pure einstein theory obtained in @xcite .",
    "the presence of the energy momentum tensor that makes up the core of the brane is able to smooth out the singularities that show up in the analytic case , rendering these solutions completely smooth .",
    "the skyrme branes obtained in this paper are asymptotically flat and therefore represent a good candidate for regular braneworlds in the dgp model in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it is also clear that one could generalize our skyrme model to higher dimensions in order to accomodate the dgp braneworld models of higher codimension within a similar framework to the one studied here . on the other hand ,",
    "the properties of the gravitational sector of the braneworld may be affected by the details of the brane core @xcite so it would be interesting to test these ideas within our model .",
    "furthermore , we have found that there is a maximum value of the coupling constant beyond which smooth solutions are not possible anymore .",
    "it is not clear what type of objects one should obtain for larger values of the coupling constant .",
    "one possibility is to relax the staticity of the metric .",
    "this seems to suggest that the branes would start to inflate in a similar way to the solutions found in @xcite .",
    "this is certainly a possibility although we note that the situation is slightly different from the usual defect solutions since we do not have any potential energy in our model , so the possibility of having topological inflation @xcite at the core does not seem very likely .    we have also found that there are two branches of solutions .",
    "we expect , as it happens in the @xmath49 case , that the lower ( upper ) branch corresponds to a stable ( unstable ) configuration , although the stability calculation has to be performed taking into account the new possible channels opened due to the extradimensional nature of the solutions we have .",
    "we hope to come back to these and other interesting issues for skyrme branes in a future publication .",
