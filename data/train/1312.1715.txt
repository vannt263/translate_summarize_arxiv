    "( 2012 , 2013a , b ) reported the discovery of a 3 m@xmath3 gas cloud plunging toward the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) at the galactic center ( gc ) with a predicted closest approach of only 2400 times the radius of the event horizon . if this object  called g2  is indeed a gas cloud , it would be ripped apart by the tidal forces of the smbh during closest approach and then accreted ( burkert et al .",
    "2012 ; schartmann et al .",
    "2012 ; anninos et al . 2012 ; shcherbakov 2013 ; abarca et al .",
    "2013 ) . while the identification of the source as a gas cloud is controversial and many alternative models containing a central stellar source have been proposed ( e.g. , murray - clay & loeb 2012 ; miralda - escude 2012 ; eckart et al . 2013 ; scoville & burkert 2013 ; ballone et al .",
    "2013 ) , all the observations indicate that low density gas associated with this object is being tidally disrupted ( gillessen et al .",
    "2012 , 2013a , b ; phifer et al .",
    "2013 ) . in the case of a pure gas cloud ,",
    "models predict radio shocks to begin 7 to 9 months ahead of periapse passage of the center of mass ( narayan et al .",
    "2012 ; sadowski et al .",
    "no such shocks have been observed to date .",
    "regardless of the underlying nature of g2 , most models predict that the disrupted material should eventually be accreted onto the smbh , possibly as an observable event ( e.g. , fragile et al .",
    "this could provide a rare opportunity to follow a predicted accretion event , potentially teaching us about black hole accretion physics .",
    "the first orbit for g2 was derived from data based on l-band ( 3.8 @xmath4 m ) astrometry and br-@xmath1 radial velocities ( gillessen et al . 2012 ) .",
    "it was then shown by phifer et al .",
    "( 2013 ) that a more accurate solution is found by using the br-@xmath1 emission for astrometry as well , shifting the predicted time of closest approach from mid-2013 to early 2014 ( see first column of table  [ tab1 ] ) . here ,",
    "we report an update to phifer et al.s ( 2013 ) solution by incorporating new 2013 data .    the new data set consists of three epochs with 36 frames taken on may 1113 , 28 frames taken on july 2527 , and 32 frames taken on august 1113 with the ao - fed integral field spectrograph osiris .",
    "each frame has an integration time of 15 mins . in july and august the narrow - band kn3 filter , which is centered on the br-@xmath1 hydrogen line ( 2.1661 @xmath4 m ) was used , while in may the kbb broadband filter was selected .",
    "both set - ups led to a spectral resolution of r @xmath5 3600 . the data reduction , extraction of radial velocities , and absolute astrometric positions were carried out in the same way as in phifer et al .",
    "( 2013 ) .",
    "the third column in table  [ tab1 ] shows our current best - fit orbital solution .",
    "both near - ir groups have converged to consistent orbits .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the astrometric and rv data points together with the best - fit .",
    "it is interesting to note that a purely keplerian orbit is sufficient to describe the motion of g2 . given the possible interpretation of g2 as a pure gas cloud , it is unclear how a perfectly keplerian orbit can be maintained up to 6 months before pericenter .",
    "a central ( stellar ) core within the cloud seems a straightforward explanation of the observed dynamics .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig1 ] shows the br-@xmath1 emission at a lower rv of @xmath6 km / s which was claimed to fall on g2 s orbit further downstream and was therefore interpreted as g2 s tail emission ( gillessen et al .",
    "while the rv does coincide with g2 s orbit , this gas feature does not fall on g2 s orbit spatially ( see also phifer et al .",
    "2013 ) . in a position - velocity diagram ( gillessen et al .",
    "2012 , 2013a , b ) this fact gets masked by the finite width of the curved slit used to extract rvs along the orbit .",

    "an important context in the discussion of g2 s properties and nature is the abundance of similar sources in the central arc - secs of our galaxy .",
    "is g2 the only red emission - line object at the very center ?",

    "quite a few very red sources similar to g2 clearly stand out ( see also eckart et al .",
    "the right panel plots spectra for some of these sources .",
    "a subset shows significant br-@xmath1 emission and no absorption features typical for late - type giants .",
    "while g2 , in contrast to the other sources , shows substantial rv changes and an evolution of the emission - line s fwhm , it seems to be one of many similar sources .",

    ", we do not confirm this detection in the keck data .",
    "while there is some residual extended flux at the position of g2 ( as inferred from the br-@xmath1 based orbit ) , this flux level is not greater than typical contributions from the halos of the bright irs 16 sources ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "a residual map that combines many epochs from 2008  2012 , using the known motion of g2 to transform them into a g2 rest - frame , does not show a source at g2 s position .",
    "the flux level inside a circular aperture is not above the level of test apertures placed at random positions .",
    "while it can not be ruled out that some of the flux is indeed associated with g2 , we do nt see any evidence for this connection when halo noise clearly dominates the region in these low flux levels .",
