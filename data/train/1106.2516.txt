    "experimental results combined with theoretical considerations imply the existence of new physics beyond the standard model , at energies no greater than 1tev .",
    "although this has been known for a while  @xcite , the possibility of accessing this energy scale , known as the `` terascale , '' has now been realized in current - day hadron colliders and the experiments that use them .",
    "these notes provide a brief overview of the experimental considerations and design needed to measure particle interactions at the terascale .    to probe directly the physics at the 1 tev scale , we need a momentum transfer @xmath0 of approximately 1 tev between the initial state particles .",
    "this direct requirement assumes we are most interested in producing real ( on - shell ) new particles .",
    "there is still a role , of course , for precision experiments on the intensity frontier that measure the effects of off - shell new particles in loop diagrams , but that lies outside the current discussion of the energy frontier .",
    "to achieve the goal of beams for terascale physics , we consider three possibilities .",
    "first , we could pursue collisions of high - energy beams on stationary targets , but the center - of - mass energy in such collisions scales only as @xmath1 , so this option seems impractical .",
    "second , we might investigate a lepton - antilepton collider , in which the center - of - mass energy scales with @xmath2 .",
    "third , we might pursue a hadron - hadron collider , either with proton - proton or proton - antiproton collisions . because the hadrons are composite particles with varying constituent momenta ,",
    "this approach is somewhat less convenient than a lepton - antilepton collider .",
    "nevertheless , we shall see that other considerations favor the hadron collider concept as implemented in the large hadron collider .",
    "synchrotron radiation limits the choices of lepton - antilepton colliders , since the energy radiated by a charged particle in each turn of a circular accelerator is proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "for example , radiation losses per turn were @xmath4 for each electron in the lep collider @xmath5 beams . even though the losses can be overcome , replacing the energy through acceleration after each turn is prohibitively inefficient .",
    "for these reasons we expect high - energy colliders either to accelerate more massive charged particles ( protons or muons ) or to push the ring radius @xmath6 to its ultimate limit in a linear collider .",
    "there are two caveats relating to linear colliders .",
    "first , a linear collider seems to require full accumulation of beam particles and full acceleration for each shot , unless the beam particles can be recycled .",
    "second , accelerating beams to 500 gev ( the energy required for a 1 tev lepton collider to probe the `` terascale '' ) requires very high acceleration gradients over a very long linear path .",
    "given that the state of the art in radiofrequency gradients is about @xmath7 , accelerating a single beam to @xmath8 would take about @xmath9 .",
    "work is ongoing to improve those gradients for a high - energy linear electron - positron collider .",
    "the rest of our discussion will focus on circular proton or antiproton colliders . whereas accelerating non - relativistic particles requires only a bending magnetic field fixed to @xmath10 and a constant accelerating cyclotron frequency @xmath11",
    ", accelerating relativistic particles requires an accelerating frequency @xmath12 . during acceleration , then , ramping up the @xmath13 field bends the beams of increasing momentum within a fixed bending radius while allowing a fixed accelerating frequency to be used . in mks units , @xmath14 ,",
    "where the momentum @xmath15 has units of gev / c , @xmath13 has units of tesla , and @xmath6 has units of meters .",
    "there are obvious limits to both @xmath13 and @xmath6 , some physical and some geographical .",
    "if our goal is to have a proton beam of at least @xmath16 in order to access the terascale physics at @xmath17 , we must work within these limitations . to maximize the bending radius",
    ", we might choose the large underground ring at cern ( an octagon with alternating straight accelerating and bending sections ) , which has a @xmath18 average radius .",
    "in this ring , a @xmath16 beam requires an average bending field of @xmath19 , while a @xmath20 beam requires @xmath21 .",
    "( since the bending magnets are not distributed everywhere around the ring , the peak requirements are somewhat higher , up to @xmath22 for the @xmath20 case . )",
    "these fields are far above the domain saturation cutoff for regular ferromagnets , but superconducting magnets can achieve close to @xmath23 in the steady state , limited by intercable and interfilament forces .",
    "a heavy laboratory - industrial partnership has developed nbti `` rutherford cable '' needed to bend beams of the required momentum in the cern ring now occupied by the large hadron collider .    given the possibility of accelerating and bending high - energy beams in a large enough ring , what beam intensities are needed for studies of the rare interactions of the terascale ?",
    "the answer depends on several variables , including the beam size , particle spacing , and potential effects on the experiments .",
    "the small interaction rates expected at @xmath24 require instantaneous luminosities of @xmath25 to collect enough events to study . with the design parameters of the lhc , this corresponds to @xmath26 protons per beam .",
    "( these required luminosities are much greater than those available at the fermilab tevatron , where the proton - antiproton collisions have instantaneous luminosities of @xmath27 . )    up to this point we have kept open the possibility of proton - antiproton or proton - proton collisions , but now we have to make a choice .",
    "antiproton - proton collisions have some advantage , as they enhance the @xmath28 initial states due to the dominant parton distributions at high parton momentum .",
    "unfortunately it seems unfeasible to pack @xmath26 antiprotons into a single beam . at the tevatron ,",
    "25 years of experience producing and accumulating antiprotons has resulted in a maximum accumulation rate of @xmath29 antiprotons per hour , giving a maximum antiproton count of @xmath30 in a beam .",
    "this is a factor of 100 too low of the value needed to produce events in the rarest interactions . as a result , to investigate rare processes with @xmath31 occurring at low rates , the proton - proton collider is the only choice at present .",
    "the large hadron collider is the final stage of the cern accelerator chain shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cernaccel ] .",
    "protons are taken from a single bottle of hydrogen gas , accelerated in the linac and proton synchrotron to @xmath32 , and injected into the super proton synchrotron .",
    "after being accelerated in the sps to @xmath33 , protons are injected into the twin rings of the lhc .",
    "the staged injection energies for each accelerator minimize the required operational range for the bending magnets .    ]",
    "the lhc itself is composed of two rings , one for each proton beam direction . because the existing cern tunnel has a diameter of just @xmath34 , a `` twin - bore '' design first proposed by blewett is used . in this design both rings",
    "are contained in a single superconducting cold mass and cryostat , but the magnetic dipole fields point in opposite directions to provide lorentz bending force toward the center of the ring .",
    "an important part of the magnet design is the total dipole length of @xmath35 , chosen to reduce the number of inter - cryostat connections .",
    "the high magnetic field and large volume of these dipoles imply an enormous amount of stored magnetic energy in each magnet .",
    "a simple calculation per magnet of @xmath36 demonstrates the need for a quench protection system .",
    "the superconducting cable quenches and becomes a regular ohmic conductor if the temperature or magnetic field rise above critical values .",
    "if the current is not carried away through shunt resistances , it has the potential to boil off liquid helium explosively .",
    "the protons beams themselves are accelerated with radio frequencies of 400 mhz , giving rise to synchroton oscillations that group protons into rf `` buckets . ''",
    "the collision rates in the interaction regions are proportional to @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the number of protons per bunch and @xmath39 is the number of bunches .",
    "the lhc design goal is 2808 bunches . within the beams ,",
    "the proton population is distributed in both position space and momentum space , and the `` emittance '' is a measure of that spread .",
    "the longitudinal emittance relates to the bunch length , while the transverse emittance relates to the bunch ( beam ) width .",
    "the lhc beams are squeezed as they approach the interaction points , with the `` strength '' of the squeezing gradient given by @xmath40 .",
    "formally , @xmath40 is the distance from the interaction point where the beam width doubles , and a lower value of @xmath40 means the beam is smaller at the interaction point . during early lhc operations a typical value of @xmath40 has been @xmath41 .    to calculate the expected rate of collisions in the lhc , we define the instantaneous luminosity @xmath42 , measured in units of area@xmath43time@xmath43 .",
    "ultimately phase 1 of the lhc will reach instantaneous luminosities of @xmath25 at full intensity .",
    "we can also write @xmath42 in units of cross section , using the definition @xmath44 or @xmath45 , to estimate the rate of specific physics interactions .",
    "for example , with @xmath46 and inelastic proton - proton interaction cross section @xmath47 we expect a rate of @xmath48 interactions per second .",
    "since the experiments collect data over an extended period of time , the integrated luminosity @xmath49 is defined with units @xmath50 , and then the dimensionless product @xmath51 is the total number of interactions .    _",

    "with the necessary beams designed and constructed to produce rare interactions sensitive to tev - scale physics , we turn to the challenge of measuring the high - energy particles in the final states of those interactions .",
    "it is especially instructive to consider how particle detectors work from the point of view of the fundamental interactions .",
    "this allows us to predict how existing detectors would respond to new unusual particles in theories beyond the standard model .    in a nutshell ,",
    "the ultimate goal of particle detection is to measure the 4-momentum of each final state particle .",
    "this can be accomplished by measuring @xmath56 , @xmath57 , or @xmath58 .",
    "this last form makes use of the definitions for transverse momentum @xmath59 and pseudorapidity @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "the relativistic momentum can be measured in a magnetic spectrometer , while the velocity in the lab frame can be measured in certain cases with precision timing circuits .",
    "particle mass can be inferred from the energy loss through ionization , and the scalar energy can be measured in a shower of large cross section interactions .    it is clear that there must be _ some _ interaction of the final state particles with the detector medium , and we make use of the two highest - rate interactions  the electromagnetic and strong interactions .",
    "these two interactions affect the particles on two very different energy scales , since the electromagnetic interaction occurs on the atomic length scale ( ev energy scale ) and the strong interaction occurs on the nuclear length scale ( gev energy scale )  @xcite .",
    "a magnetic spectrometer is at the heart of every lhc experiment .",
    "the lorentz force causes charged particles to move in helical trajectories in a solenoidal field . measuring the sagitta of the projected helix gives a clean estimate of the particle s transverse momentum , using the relation @xmath61 where @xmath42 is the total arc length over which the sagitta is measured .",
    "in general , the uncertainty on the transverse momentum scales as @xmath62 .",
    "requirements on momentum resolution , dictated by physics goals , translate directly to requirements on sagitta resolutions . as an example , the atlas collaboration set a goal of 10% momentum resolution for @xmath63 muons expected from some new physics signatures .",
    "this implies a resolution of @xmath64 on the sagitta measurement for trajectories that are nearly straight in the muon spectrometer . increasing the magnetic field @xmath13 or the arc length @xmath42 ( which is effectively the detector radius for straight tracks ) increases the sagitta and leads to smaller relative uncertainties .",
    "this motivates large detectors like the atlas muon spectrometer , which has a maximum radius of @xmath65 .",
    "the interaction underlying most non - destructive measurements is the electromagnetic interaction , whether a particle scatters elastically off charges in material or loses energy through ionization of atomic electrons . in the former case , scattering from multiple charge centers results in an uncertainty on the particle s original momentum vector .",
    "this uncertainty scales with the square root of the number of scatterers ",
    "@xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the deflection expected from a single scatter  and it is a powerful motivation for limiting the amount of material in the particles path . in the latter case ,",
    "the energy loss follows the bethe - bloch formula , which in one form for a singly - charged particle looks like @xmath68 this energy loss translates directly to a number of ionization electrons along the particle trajectory .",
    "charged particle detectors used controlled electric fields to collect ionization electrons and cations . in some cases , most notably in detectors with gaseous media ,",
    "a central sense wire lies at the center of a radial electric field . as ionization electrons drift toward the center , the strongest part of the electric field , they are accelerated and induce an avalanche of additional ionization .",
    "this multiplication factor makes it possible to observe the passage of a particle in a relatively low - density medium .",
    "the position resolution of such detectors depends on exact knowledge of the drift time and is limited by placement accuracy of the central wires .",
    "another detector type uses solid - state semiconductors , usually silicon , as the interaction medium .",
    "particles passing through the semiconductor ionize valence electrons and create electron - hole pairs , which drift under an applied electric field to strip or pixel readout elements patterned on the surface .",
    "these detectors benefit from increased ionization energy loss ( roughly @xmath69 ) , but there is no amplification of collected charge , and special low - noise readout electronics are required to detect the signal .",
    "a major advantage of these detectors is that the readout element patterns can be microns apart , yielding extremely good position resolution .",
    "the disadvantages with respect to gaseous detectors are cost ( gas is much cheaper than lithographed silicon ) and processing requirements .",
    "any defects in the semiconductor crystal trap the charge carriers and prevent them from reaching the readout elements . because of their high cost and precision position resolution , solid - state detectors are most often placed near the interaction point , where they measure the first points of the particle trajectories before any scattering can take place .    by measuring the energy of a particle and either @xmath55 or @xmath70 , we can use the relation @xmath71 to determine the particle mass and therefore the particle type .",
    "measurements of @xmath55 and @xmath70 come from energy loss ( @xmath72 ) as collected by readout electronics , direct velocity measurements via precision timing , or radiation emitted by charged particles in a dielectric medium ( cherenkov or transition radiation ) .",
    "energy measurements in calorimeters are by nature destructive measurements , since their aim is to fully contain and collect the energy of the incoming particle .",
    "there are two different mechanisms by which a particle entering the dense material of the calorimeter showers into a large number of second particles .",
    "the first mechanism , the electromagnetic shower , proceeds by alternating electron bremsstrahlung to photons and subsequent conversion to electron - positron pairs . only photons and electrons participate in the electromagnetic shower , since both bremsstrahlung and pair production are maximized for low mass particles .",
    "the second mechanism , the hadronic shower , is due to nuclear interactions .",
    "for both mechanisms , the cascade undergoes exponential branching until the energy of individual particles falls below some critical energy and ionization takes over .    because of the exponential growth of the shower , the total number of secondary particles is proportional to the energy of the primary particle that entered the calorimeter .",
    "the energy resolution of the calorimeter , then , is given by @xmath73 since the fluctuations in the large number of particles follow a gaussian distribution .",
    "the secondary particles in the shower can be collected in a dedicated active medium distinct from the absorber material ( as in a non - homogeneous calorimeter ) or in the same medium that serves as absorber ( in a homogeneous calorimeter ) .",
    "this distinction has a substantial effect on the energy resolution ; for example , the electromagnetic energy resolution is @xmath74 in atlas but @xmath75 in cms . in the lhc experiments ,",
    "two distinct calorimeters are deployed , one representing a small number of nuclear interaction lengths but large number of electromagnetic radiation lengths , and one with a large number of nuclear interaction lengths .",
    "these are the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters , respectively .",
    "particles that do not interact strongly , such as muons and neutrinos , penetrate the calorimeters without showering .",
    "muons are detected in standalone external spectrometers or chambers integrated in the magnet yoke .",
    "neutrinos do not interact with any of the detector material , and any missing momentum in the collision is attributed to them .",
    "figure  [ fig : cmsid ] shows in detail the experimental signature of the standard model particles , as detected in the cms experiment .    ]",
    "the high interaction rates required to search for new physics at the tev scale present extra challenges for the lhc experiments . charged particle tracking algorithms are designed to function with detector occupancies of up to @xmath76 .",
    "these algorithms , which work by stringing together significant energy deposits ( `` hits '' ) , start with the highest - granularity silicon detectors near the interaction point and work outward , accounting for energy loss in each detector layer encountered .",
    "the experiments have been designed to meet the requirements of low occupancy even in particle - dense environments like boosted jets from high - mass resonances or higgs boson decays .",
    "certain examples of physics beyond the standard model give rise to striking experimental signatures , and it is worth looking at a few such examples .",
    "first , exotic charged massive particles ( champs ) typically have low velocities , with @xmath70 significantly less than 1 .",
    "this causes them to lose greater amounts of energy through ionization , and they may even stop in the middle of the detector if the energy loss is great enough .",
    "since the particles are massive they do not shower in the electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "r - hadrons , stable particles with heavy colored constituents , can have similar signatures .",
    "doubly - charged particles lose @xmath77 times the normal ionization energy loss in the tracking detectors , a unique signature for any experiment with @xmath72 sensitivity .",
    "second , metastable particles , such as long - lived neutralinos in theories of supersymmetry breaking , may have @xmath78 values of order @xmath79 , and the decay products do not point back to the primary interaction vertex .",
    "even though it is challenging to reconstruct particles originating in the middle of the detector , successful reconstruction makes it possible to measure the lifetime of the parent particle .",
    "third , exotic `` quirks , '' predicted in new theories of strong interactions , can appear as a mesoscopic bound state , with properties similar to a doubly - charged particle , or as a state that oscillates like a macroscopic string with two charge endpoint particles .    these and other particle interactions can be modeled with dedicated computer programs of differing complexity . on one end",
    "lies geant4  @xcite , a simulation toolkit with detailed lists of high- and low - energy interactions .",
    "each particle is tracked step - by - step through a custom model of the detector .",
    "on the other end lie fast simulation programs like pgs  @xcite and delphes  @xcite , which use parameterized detector response to each type of particle .",
    "careful consideration of the physical interactions behind the experimental techniques allows one to extrapolate detector behavior to the most unusual new possibilities ! unfortunately experiments do not have large enough computing budgets to store the detector response to each bunch crossing , so they use a multi - level trigger system to decide immediately which events should be saved .",
    "this bears repeating : unless the new physics is selected by a trigger algorithm , it will be lost forever .",
    "the lhc experiments use a combination of low - level hardware and high - level software triggers to filter events for further study . in the hardware triggers , individual trigger objects ( jets , electromagnetic clusters , muons )",
    "are identified using data from fast readout detectors .",
    "these are passed to streamlined versions of offline software algorithms to be reconstructed more fully .",
    "for example , an electron trigger might require a level-1 electromagnetic cluster with @xmath80 , followed in the high - level trigger with a set of track - matching requirements and further cluster shape cuts to reject jets and @xmath81 mesons .",
    "if the rate of electron events becomes too great , then some filter has to be tightened to reduce the overall rate .",

    "many standard model and new physics signatures include hadronic jets .",
    "these jets present many challenges for the lhc experiments , and since they are the result of peturbative and non - perturbative qcd effects they also test our theoretical framework . because the jets are measured chiefly in the calorimeters , experimentalists develop special energy calibrations to account for the effects of hadronization and contributions from pileup .    even though we do not expect a one - to - one correspondence between reconstructed jets and partons ( except possibly for the highest energy partons ) we do expect that the relation between the two should be calculable on average . in the past decade",
    "experimentalists have become more sophisticated in defining jets and comparing measurements with theoretical predictions .",
    "such comparisons are always made at the `` particle - level '' or `` hadron - level , '' after the parton shower and hadronization but before the detector interaction occurs .",
    "this means that theoretical predictions must apply a showering and hadronization model to parton - level results , and experiments must unfold the effects of jet reconstruction in the detectors .",
    "we have first to define exactly what is meant by `` jets , '' and there are three main considerations .",
    "first , what particles should be clustered , or what inputs will be given to the algorithms ?",
    "second , which particles should be combined into each jet , based on proximity and energy ?",
    "third , how should the input 4-momenta be combined ?",
    "the goal is to define jet clustering algorithms that are fast , robust under particle boosts , and able to deal with collinear and infrared radiation .",

    "searches for physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) follow one of two approaches .",
    "the search strategy may focus on a specific model , or it may target any discrepancy from the standard model expectation . both of the strategies are used in the lhc experiments , which hunt for general features in data that may correspond to a wide range of bsm models .",
    "results in this section are a sampling of techniques used in new physics searches .",
    "perhaps the most straightforward signature shared by bsm models is the total event energy .",
    "new physics related to the terascale often has energies near this scale .",
    "the outgoing events in the hard scatter set the event scale , which is near the mass of the heavy new particles .",
    "whatever the exact nature of their subsequent decay , the event energy scale is roughly preserved . as a result , the total event energy is a good estimate for the mass of new particles produced in pairs . to make this connection ,",
    "it is best to focus on a robust definition of the total events energy .",
    "there are at least three common calculations corresponding to total event energy .",
    "the first is the simple @xmath164 , for which all calorimeter energy is summed .",
    "this definition does not cover non - interacting particles , such as neutrinos or weakly interacting massive particles , nor does it account for extra calorimeter activity due to pileup events .",
    "the second is the oft - misunderstood @xmath165 , usually defined as the scalar sum of missing transverse energy and the transverse energies of identified jets and leptons .",
    "this definition works well if there are one or two non - interacting particles , but it still suffers from pileup contamination and depends on the identification of the physics objects .",
    "the third is the effective mass @xmath166 , usually defined as the scalar sum of transverse energies of the four hardest identified jets and the missing transverse energy .",
    "this definition suppresses low - energy contributions from pileup events , but it does not capture the leptonic parts of the new particles decay chains .",
    "all three of these definitions are used in various channels by the lhc experiments , where they show good discriminating power between standard model background and the new physics signal .",
    "many arguments have been advanced for higher - mass versions of sm particles , and some of these correspond to resonances ( invariant mass peaks ) of simple objects , such as leptons or jets .",
    "examples include kaluza - klein towers of particles confined in extra dimensions , @xmath167 , and @xmath168 , a 4th - generation up - type quark .",
    "reconstruction of these resonances is straightforward , if the 4-momenta of all decay objects are known .",
    "the sensitivity to resonances is limited by background contamination and invariant mass resolution , both of which are high priorities for the lhc experiments .",
    "if some of the decay products from the new resonance are invisible ( non - interacting ) , a simple invariant mass calculation will not capture the signal . in these cases , the transverse mass @xmath169\\ ] ] can be used , using as @xmath170 the missing transverse energy . if two particles decay to invisible daughters , as in cascade decay chains to lightest supersymmetric particles , it is still possible to apportion correctly the missing transverse energy .",
    "for example , in the supersymmetric decay chain @xmath171 the final state neutralinos both appear as missing transverse energy .",
    "if the @xmath172 mass is known , then the mass equivalence of the slepton mothers gives enough constraints to construct a kinematic variable whose distribution endpoint gives the slepton mass  @xcite .    for a more concrete example , consider the following decay in theories of gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking : @xmath173 assuming that the background in this dilepton channel can be estimated using an opposite - flavor sample , the background - subtracted invariant mass distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gmsbdist ] ) shows a sharp edge , indicating a kinematic limit  @xcite . in this case , the location of the edge is determined by the relation between the neutralino and slepton masses .",
    "the minimum mass for the @xmath174 system has a similar endpoint , given by the difference of the neutralino masses . by using these and other kinematic solution endpoints , it is possible to reconstruct all of the masses in the decay chain .",
    ".[fig : gmsbdist],title=\"fig : \" ] .[fig : gmsbdist],title=\"fig : \" ]    an alternative to targeted searches has emerged in the last decade . instead of developing event selections and kinematic variables designed for each of many different models and decay chains ,",
    "some experiments have deployed general search strategies .",
    "these programs , count events in each of several high-@xmath86 object classes ( @xmath175 , etc . ) and compare the results to sm expectations  @xcite .",
    "the challenge is to describe completely the sm backgrounds for all signatures at once !",
    "several discriminant distributions are considered for each class , including the scalar @xmath86 sum of all objects , the invariant mass ( or transverse mass ) of all objects , and the missing transverse energy .",
    "any discrepancies between observed data and expectations are flagged for further studies .    in conjunction with the rise in general searches ,",
    "new emphasis has been placed on simplified phenomenological models , which include the gross effects of new particle mass spectra and decay chains without focusing on the details of particle couplings and spin effects .",
    "these models have been successful in identifying experimental signatures that may have been overlooked  @xcite , and they offer hope of helping match experimental observations with consistent theoretical models of new physics  @xcite .",
    "the large hadron collider and associated experiments have been designed and constructed to answer questions about physics at the 1tev scale .",
    "the size , scope , and details of the experiments stem directly from the physics goals and requirements on measurements at that energy scale .",
    "the focus in the last few sections on higgs boson searches and other specific searches led naturally to a concentration on results from the general - purpose atlas and cms experiments , but the other lhc experiments have been designed to pursue different physics goals that are no less interesting .",
    "all of the detector interactions , many of the design considerations , and some of the analysis techniques are being brought to bear on those goals as well .",
    "a basic understanding of detector physics and practical limitations makes interpretation of experimental results more exciting and engaging , and the next few years may even bring news of exotic new particles with unexpected signatures .",
    "my discussions with matthew strassler played an important role in the development of this material , and i thank him for his suggestions .",
    "i also thank the tasi 2010 organizers  tom banks , michael dine , and subir sachdev  for their efforts and patience , and the local hosts k.t .",
