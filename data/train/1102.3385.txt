    "physical interpretation and theoretical interpretation of brownian motion , a well - known process named after the scottish botanist robert brown in 1827 , were first established by einstein and smoluchowski , then developed by langevin and many others . from these studies ,",
    "it was made clear that brownian motion is nothing but the manifestation of the presence of invisible microscopic bodies such as atoms and molecules , and their thermal motion .",
    "thus , brownian motion has naturally been discussed in relation with kinetic theories and thermodynamics . nowadays",
    "concepts and methods of stochastic processes introduced in the formulation of brownian motion are widely applied to various fields of science such as biophysics and economy .",
    "mathematical foundation of these methods has also been well studied .",
    "after thermodynamics was established in the nineteenth century , many efforts have been made to understand the thermodynamic principles from the microscopic point of view .",
    "the achievements of these efforts are summarized today as statistical mechanics . there , the time average of microscopic behaviors is replaced by an average in terms of a suitably chosen statistical ensemble of microscopic events and the temporal behavior of each particle is not questioned .",
    "therefore , the basic question to the foundation of statistical mechanics is how this substitution of averages is justified from the microscopic deterministic point of view .",
    "of course such a question has been studied deeply in many ways since the time of maxwell , boltzmann and gibbs such as @xmath0-theorem and ergodic theory .",
    "mathematically rigorous or not , for physicists the overwhelming success of statistical mechanics itself to describe the nature for thermally equilibrated systems could be considered as the proof of validity of the hypothesis .",
    "on the other hand , recently , it is more and more becoming important to understand the bulk properties of a dynamical system where the thermodynamic equilibrium is not necessarily attained .",
    "for example , in the field of relativistic heavy ion collisions ( ric ) , we would like to determine the thermodynamic properties of quark and gluon plasma ( qgp ) from the experimental data .",
    "ric is somehow the unique way in laboratories to extract the thermodynamic properties of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in the deconfined phase .",
    "however , of course , real systems in ric situation are not in thermodynamic equilibrium , since the system size and the reaction time scale are finite .",
    "although many successful models , such as relativistic hydrodynamics have been employed to describe several aspects of the observed data , we feel still an existence of missing link  between the thermodynamic properties and microscopic dynamics .",
    "for example , several questions like , how much can we be sure that the equation of state used to fit the experimental flow data with hydrodynamics should be the same as that of obtained from the lattice qcd calculations ?",
    ", is the extended thermodynamics valid and unique ? , or how to deal with the relativistic covariance and thermodynamic limit ?",
    "are yet difficult to be answered . in this sense",
    ", it may still worthwhile to ask the repeated question for the basic foundation of statistical mechanics from the view point of these new physics necessities of nowadays .",
    "the stochastic energetics may serve a useful tool to understand the questions above @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the dynamics of each event of a brownian motion is directly reflected in the change of thermodynamic quantities , such as heat , energy and work .",
    "that is , these thermodynamic quantities are also dealt as stochastic variables , reflecting in the name of this approach , _",
    "stochastic energetics_. therefore , the application of this approach seems to be useful for ric studies , where event by event fluctuations are considered to carry important information on qcd @xcite .",
    "so far , the stochastic energetics has been applied to non - relativistic phenomena .",
    "however it seems very attractive to apply this approach to investigate the thermodynamic properties for relativistic systems .",
    "this is because it is possible to incorporate the effect of special relativity ( such as the lorentz transform ) into the model in a straight - forward manner , permitting to discuss directly the relation between thermodynamics and the theory of relativity .",
    "such an analysis is difficult in statistical physics where temporal averages are replaced by ensemble averages from the beginning .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that the stochastic energetics is still applicable to brownian motion of a relativistic particle .",
    "it is important to notice that this is not a trivial problem , because equations of motion for stochastic variables involves a finite time interval so that the space and time entangles when the lorentz transformation is involved .",
    "therefore , we have to pay a special attention for the treatment of noise when we discuss a relativistic stochastic motion in a general reference frame .    the present paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 , we introduce a model of relativistic brownian motion . relativistic generalization of brownian motion has been discussed by many authors dud , hak , ben , oron , boyer1,boyer2,pos , deb , fra , hanggi1,hanggi2,zyga , rev_hanggi , but the definitive answer to this problem has not yet established , or simply does not exist in a unique manner . as mentioned above ,",
    "this is because of the difficulty to introduce a manifestly lorentz covariant noise in an unambiguous way , as well as its physical model . here , instead of formulating a covariant equation of motion for stochastic variables in a general case ,",
    "we discuss a less ambitious problem .",
    "we start from a langevin equation for relativistic brownian motion defined in the rest frame of a heat bath .",
    "then we determine how the noise term should transform under an arbitrary lorentz boost of the system in order to keep the internal consistency .",
    "we show that in such a situation , we can introduce a consistent noise term . in sec . 3",
    ", we apply the idea of the stochastic energetics to our model of relativistic brownian motion and derive the first and the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "we also discuss the relation between the rate of heat transfer and the relativistic equipartition relation .",
    "summary and concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "4 .    in this paper",
    ", we used the natural unit , @xmath1 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the formulation of the relativistic langevin equation contains still an open question due to the transformation property of the thermal noise . to avoid this question , we start with a well - defined model of relativistic brownian motion in the rest frame of a heat bath",
    ". then we study the transformation of the system under a lorentz boost and check the consistency between our model and special relativity .",
    "we consider the brownian motion of a relativistic particle with mass @xmath2 in the 3 + 1 dimension . in the rest frame of a heat bath ,",
    "we consider the following langevin equation ,    @xmath3    where @xmath4 , that is , the particle always kept on the mass - shell . throughout this paper",
    ", we use the symbol @xmath5 to indicate the value of a variable defined in the rest frame of the heat bath . the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 characterize , respectively , the relaxation of the momentum and the strength of the noise .",
    "we assume that they are lorentz scalar functions , depending only on the particle energy in this frame .",
    "@xmath8 is a gaussian white noise three - vector    @xmath9    and has the following correlation properties , @xmath10the symbol @xmath11 denotes the stochastic average of @xmath12 in the rest frame of the heat bath ( we refer to as rf ) .",
    "the similar langevin equations have already discussed in refs .",
    "deb , fra , hanggi1,hanggi2,zyga , rev_hanggi .",
    "note that the langevin equation can be obtained even from a binary collision model @xcite .",
    "now we replace the langevin equation with the following stochastic differential equation ( sde ) ,    @xmath13    here we have introduced the wiener process @xmath14 and its difference by    @xmath15    the correlations are given by @xmath16    the last term of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : sde1 ] ) , @xmath17 is a kind of stieltjes integral for the stochastic variable .",
    "the definition of stieltjes integral in stochastic variables is known to be not unique .",
    "here we consider the three typical cases .",
    "note that this problem associated with the discretization scheme is discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite in detail .    1",
    ".   ito interpretation @xcite : + in this case , the term ( [ lastterm ] ) is interpreted as @xmath18 hereafter , we use the symbol @xmath19 to indicate the ito interpretation of the integral measure . 2 .",
    "stratonovich - fisk interpretation @xcite : + in this case ( hereafter , we use the symbol @xmath20 ) , the term ( lastterm ) is interpreted as @xmath21 where , in the second line , we used the ito formula ( see appendix ) to convert the stratonovich - fisk interpretation by the ito scheme .",
    "hnggi - klimontovich @xcite : + in this case ( hereafter , we use the symbol @xmath22 ) , the term ( lastterm ) as @xmath23 here , again , we used the ito formula to express this interpretation in terms of ito scheme .",
    "see appendix .",
    "the equilibrium distribution function described by using these sdes depends on the integral schemes defined above . to see this",
    ", we introduce the probability density in the phase space defined in the thermal bath rest frame , @xmath24 the time evolution of @xmath25 is given by the fokker - planck equation in a unified way for the different integral schemes as@xmath26 the values of the parameter @xmath27 correspond to the different discretization schemes : @xmath28 for the hnggi - klimontovich scheme , @xmath29 for the stratonovich - fisk scheme , and @xmath30 for the ito scheme .    from this equation ,",
    "we find that the corresponding equilibrium distribution ( spatially homogeneous and static ) is given by @xmath31 since the phase space volume element @xmath32 should be an invariant measure under the lorentz transformation of the reference frame , we conclude that this equilibrium distribution ( [ rho ] ) should be a lorentz scalar function , although the proof is not trivial at all @xcite .",
    "as we will see later , we can define the transformation property of the noise by using this fact .",
    "we consider the reference frame which is moving with a constant velocity @xmath33 with respect to the rest frame of the heat bath .",
    "we refer to as _ mf - moving frame_. the four - momentum @xmath34 in this frame is then given by the lorentz transform of @xmath35 as@xmath36where @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the projection operators are defined by @xmath39 and @xmath40 with @xmath41 . in the proceeding calculations , we assume that the particle is always on mass - shell @xmath42 during the whole stochastic process so that the stochastic variables , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are not independent .",
    "we then have,@xmath45where @xmath46 . substituting this expression into eq .",
    "( dp_mf ) , we obtain the sde in the mf as @xmath47where @xmath48 and @xmath49here @xmath50 is the four velocity @xmath51 normalized as @xmath52 .",
    "the presence of a second rank tensor @xmath53 indicates that the noise is no longer isotropic in the moving frame @xcite .",
    "the last term is not yet transformed because it contains the noise @xmath54 which is defined only in the rf .",
    "we first introduce the stochastic noise which shows the property of the gaussian white noise in the mf as@xmath55 here the symbol @xmath56 denotes the stochastic average of @xmath12 in the mf . as was assumed in previous works dud , hak , ben , oron , boyer1,boyer2,pos , deb , fra , hanggi1,hanggi2 , we may consider that the correlations of the noise term are lorentz invariant in the rest frame of the particle , and we could write @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the proper time of the particle , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the lorentz factors of the particle in the rf and in the mf , respectively . they are related through@xmath61 where , now @xmath62 is the lorentz factor associated to the lorentz transformation from the rf to the mf . in this case , we conclude that the transformation property of the noise is given by @xmath63    although very reasonable , a proof of the above argument is not obvious .",
    "the reason is that the stieltjes integral associated with the noise term is defined on the time span @xmath64 , so that @xmath54 is non - local in the time @xmath65 .",
    "thus the lorentz transformation entangles with the integration scheme in the order of @xmath64 .",
    "then the noise term itself is not necessarily covariant but can constitute a lorentz vector only together with the force term .",
    "that is , the force part and the stochastic part could be mixed .",
    "this might be understood well from the argument of the kinetic derivation of hydrodynamics . in the rest frame of fluids , the velocities of molecules",
    "are completely random and all the kinetic energy of molecules are replaced by internal thermodynamic quantities . on the other hand ,",
    "when fluids move , a part of velocities of molecules contributes to the collective flow of fluids . in this case , the first order correlation calculated in the mf of the noise term in the rest frame of the heat bath would not necessarily vanish , @xmath66 even if @xmath67 . considering the finiteness of @xmath68",
    "let us write , instead of eq .",
    "( trans1 ) , the following more general transformation property of the noise , @xmath69 here @xmath70 term entangles with the force term in the mf , which should be separated from the pure stochastic part @xmath71 , satisfying eqs .",
    "( [ noise1 ] ) and ( [ noise2 ] ) . with this definition and using the ito formula ,",
    "the langevin equation is given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 the last term in eq .",
    "( [ p - boosted ] ) should be calculated according to the ito scheme .",
    "note that the ito formula to convert the sde from one scheme to the other must be used only after the transformation of the noise , eq .",
    "( trans2 ) .",
    "the corresponding fokker - plank equation for the sde ( [ p - boosted ] ) is @xmath74 \\rho , \\ ] ] where @xmath75 consequently , the equilibrium distribution function is given by the solution of the following equation , @xmath76 \\rho_{\\rm eq}(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{p})=0,\\ ] ] leading to the equilibrium distribution @xmath77 satisfying @xmath78 since @xmath79 should be a scalar function , the above expression must coincide with the lorentz transform of the logarithmic derivative of the equilibrium distribution function obtained in the rf .",
    "a lengthy but straightforward calculation shows that @xmath79 * *  * * can be the lorentz scalar only when@xmath80 thus , for the present model of a brownian motion with the noise from a given heat bath , we conclude that the noise term transforms separately from the force term when we go to one reference frame to the other .",
    "that is , the transformation of the noise ( [ trans1 ] ) is consistent with the special relativity , and the corresponding sde in a mf should be given by eq .",
    "( eqn : sdealt ) .",
    "when the background does not satisfy this condition , it is not obvious if we can always assume @xmath81 from the beginning .",
    "our discussion here is only for the thermal background is homogeneous and static .",
    "so far , we have not specified the parameter of the sde , but when we demand that the equilibrium distribution function should be given by the jttner distribution in a mf , @xmath82 where @xmath83 denotes temperature .",
    "from this condition , the parameters of the sde satisfy the following relation , @xmath84 which is the generalized einstein s fluctuation - dissipation relation of relativistic brownian motion .",
    "note that this relation depends on @xmath27 , showing the discretization scheme dependence when @xmath85 is not a constant .",
    "once we have established the sde for a relativistic particle embedded in a heat bath , we can discuss the thermodynamic property of the system defined as the ensemble of these relativistic brownian particles .",
    "for this purpose , from now on , we discuss only in the rest frame of the heat bath ,    @xmath86    where we have not assumed the generalized fluctuation - dissipation relation . for the sake of the discussion of the first law of thermodynamics , we introduced a scalar potential @xmath87 where the explicit time dependence of @xmath88 represents the effect of some external forces .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , let us introduce heat as a stochastic variable associated with brownian motion",
    ". among the three contributions of the forces in eq.([eqn : rse_1 ] ) , the last two terms represent the interactions between a system and the heat bath .",
    "the first term represents the mechanical force through the scalar potential @xmath88 .",
    "thus the work done by the heat bath , that is , the heat transfer , @xmath89 to a brownian particle is defined as for quantities which are , in general , not perfect differentials . ]",
    "@xmath90    using eq.([eqn : rse_1 ] ) we can rewrite eq.([dq1 ] ) as @xmath91 here , we identify the first term represents the change of the total energy of a brownian particle @xmath92 including its potential energy . the quantity @xmath93 in the last term is the change of the energy contained in the scalar potential @xmath88 due to the change in some external parameters contained in @xmath88 .",
    "that is , it can be interpreted as the mechanical work @xmath94 done by the external forces to the system .",
    "thus , rewriting eq.([1st_law ] ) as @xmath95 we can view this as the first law of thermodynamics in the framework of the stochastic energetics , the generalization of ref .",

    "note that this relation is satisfied for each event of brownian motion . ) , we may as well introduce it through the mass shift as @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is a coupling constant .",
    "this type of interaction is known , for example , in the relativistic mean - field theory in nuclear physics . even if we use such a kind of potentials , it is still possible to derive eq . ( [ 1st ] ) . ]      in the above , we introduced the potential @xmath88 to identify clearly the role of external work in the first law of thermodynamics , and , there , the choice of the parameters of the sde was arbitrary . in the following discussion of other thermodynamic relations , however , we will consider only the case where @xmath98 and impose the generalized fluctuation - dissipation theorem to the sde .    for deriving the second law of thermodynamics in the stochastic energetics ,",
    "we introduce shannon s information entropy , @xmath99 where @xmath25 is defined in eq.([rho ] ) and satisfies the fokker - plank equation ( [ fp ] ) .",
    "the integration in eq.([entro ] ) is taken over all the phase space volume . from these definitions for heat ( [ dq1 ] ) and entropy ( [ entro ] ) , it is easy to show that the time derivatives of heat and entropy are related as @xmath100 since the right - hand side of the above equation is non - negative , we obtain the following inequality , @xmath101 which is nothing but the second law of thermodynamics . for the non - relativistic case , see ref .",
    "an important fact is that , differently from the first law , the second law is satisfied only for the average heat , and can be violated for each event , as is the case of the fluctuation theorem .      in the preceding section",
    ", we have shown that the first and the second laws of thermodynamics can be consistently derived by generalizing the stochastic energetics to relativistic brownian motion .",
    "let us apply this approach to discuss another example , the equipartion theorem .    in non - relativistic systems ,",
    "the equipartion theorem tells us that the average kinetic energy of a particle of an ideal gas in equilibrium is equally distributed by @xmath102 for each degree of freedom . for @xmath103-dimensional mono - atomic gas ,",
    "we have@xmath104 where @xmath105 denotes the expectation value of @xmath106 at the instant @xmath107 which can be expressed as@xmath108 with @xmath109 is the solution of the fokker - plank equation corresponding to the following non - relativistic sde ,    @xmath110    where @xmath111 is a potential and @xmath112 .",
    "note that , the above average ( [ av ] ) using the solution of the fokker - planck equation is equivalent to the event average for the corresponding noise .    in the stochastic energetics , this relation for equipartition of energy",
    "is seen to be valid in more general situation if the average heat transfer vanishes even if the system is not in equilibrium @xcite . to see this",
    ", we consider the case where @xmath85 is a constant so that the noise is additive .",
    "then , the time derivative of the heat described by this sde is given by    @xmath113    where the left hand side average is the event average .",
    "one can see that the equipartition relation is satisfied , when the heat transfer disappears even @xmath114 is not the equilibrium distribution .",
    "thus we may consider the condition of the null heat transfer leads to the equipartition relation in more generalized situation .",
    "we will apply this idea to relativistic brownian motion .",
    "the relativistic analogue is not trivial in the sense that there is no simple interpretation of the quantity involved @xcite .",
    "the expectation value of relativistic kinetic energy , @xmath115 does not satisfy a simple relation such as eq .",

    "tolman proposed to read eq .",

    "( [ tolman ] ) is proportional to the average of @xmath120 which is interpreted to be the momentum transfer rate than the kinetic energy itself .    as an application of the stochastic energetics for relativistic brownian motion",
    ", we can derive the relativistic analogue of eq .",
    "( [ nrheat ] ) . taking the noise average of eq .",
    "( [ dq1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath121 to derive this expression , we have used the relation,@xmath122 from eq .",
    "( [ dq2 ] ) the null heat transfer rate leads to a relation,@xmath123 independent of @xmath114 .",
    "we call the above equation as the generalized equipartition theorem for the relativistic brownian motion .",
    "note that this relation does not have the same form of the tolman relation ( [ tolman2 ] ) .",
    "only when the multiplicative noise is chosen as @xmath124 , eq .",
    "( [ dq0 ] ) coincides with @xmath125 as in the non - relativistic case of eq .",
    "( [ nrheat ] ) which is valid even in out of equilibrium . in the ultra - relativistic limit , this relation is reduced to@xmath126 where @xmath127 so that it is related to the specific heat of the system .",
    "the meaning of the equipartition theorem is modified for more general cases .",
    "for example , suppose the noise has the energy dependence as @xmath128 with @xmath129 , then eq.([dq0 ] ) becomes@xmath130 in the ultra - relativistic limit , and @xmath131 in the non - relativistic brownian motion ( for non - relativistic case , eq .",

    "( [ ept_ur ] ) and ( [ epr_nonr ] ) . of course these relations",
    "do not make sense for @xmath140 in eq.([ept_ur ] ) or for @xmath141 in eq.([epr_nonr ] ) , since the left had side ( so the right hand side , too ) diverges .",
    "note that the condition , eq.([ept_ur ] ) or eq.([epr_nonr ] ) , itself does not determine the distribution function .",
    "of course , if we assume that there exists a distribution function , @xmath142 , independent of @xmath143 satisfying eq.([ept_ur ] ) for any @xmath144 we can demonstrate that such a distribution function should be proportional to @xmath145 and similary for non - relativistic case .",
    "for a finite @xmath146 the distribution function still reflects the initial condition and depends on @xmath147    thus , as stated before , the null heat transfer condition does not mean that the system is in equilibrium , but inversely , the null heat transfer condition is naturally satisfied in thermal equilibrium for any choice of @xmath7 . for more general noise coefficient , this can be seen directly from eq .",
    "( [ dq2 ] ) by re - expressing it as@xmath148the integrand vanishes if @xmath149 is given by the jttner distribution function .",
    "therefore , in thermal equilibrium , both of the generalized equipartition theorem ( [ dq0 ] ) and the tolman relation ( [ tolman2 ] ) are satisfied at the same time .    to see how the null heat transfer condition is attained",
