    "maximizing the rate of @xcite . ] of transmission and minimizing the bit error rate",
    "have been intensely pursued in single user communication systems .",
    "multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) systems offer the potential to improve both and hence , are immensely popular .",
    "bit error rate is an issue in the case of coding over a fixed number of time slots while achievable rate is a performance metric when coding over infinite time slots is allowed .",
    "so , the design of space - time block codes ( stbc ) in single user mimo systems incorporated two properties as performance metrics - the information losslessness property of an stbc and the diversity gain offered by an stbc @xcite .",
    "the former assures that the maximum achievable rate is not sacrificed by introduction of the stbc block in the mimo system while the latter assures a degree of reliability in the data when the code length is restricted and snr - independent finite constellation input is used .",
    "many recent works on multiuser communication systems , specifically on interference networks , have focused on sum - capacity optimal or approximate sum - capacity optimal transmission strategies .",
    "the notion of approximate sum - capacity is captured by the concept of degrees of freedom ( dof ) .",
    "the sum dof of a gaussian interference network is said to be @xmath7 if the sum - capacity can be written as @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "wireless @xmath2-networks are a class of gaussian interference networks with @xmath9 transmitters and @xmath10 receivers where every receiver demands an independent message from every transmitter so that there is a total of @xmath11 messages meant to be transmitted in the network .",
    "we shall denote an @xmath2 network with @xmath3 antennas at every node by @xmath12-network .",
    "a sum dof of @xmath13 was shown to be achievable in a @xmath14-network in @xcite while jafar and shamai in @xcite showed that a sum dof of @xmath0 is achievable using the idea of interference alignment ( ia ) .",
    "further , @xmath0 is proven @xcite to be an outerbound on the sum dof of @xmath14-network which establishes @xmath0 to be the sum dof of @xmath14-network .",
    "recently , alamouti codes were intelligently coupled with channel dependent precoding @xcite to achieve a sum - dof of @xmath4 in the @xmath15-network .",
    "also , a diversity gain of two was assured .",
    "the transmission scheme in @xcite shall be referred to as the ljj scheme . in a sense , the performance metrics that the ljj scheme highlights i.e. , achieving the maximum sum dof and a diversity gain that is strictly greater than one , is akin to the properties sought after in the design of stbcs for single user communication systems i.e. , the information losslessness property and the diversity gain .",
    "note that sum dof is an approximate sum - capacity at high snr .",
    "thus , stbcs with information losslessness property that were sought after in single user systems is now translated to approximate sum - capacity lossless design of stbcs in the @xmath15-network .",
    "the design of stbcs that offer diversity gain in @xmath14-network however comes with a crucial difference with respect to the single user scenario .",
    "local channel knowledge ( i.e. , every transmitter knows only its own channel ) is assumed in the ljj scheme for the @xmath15-network whereas the design of information lossless stbcs in the single user set - up does not assume csit .",
    "similarly , an extension of the ljj scheme for the @xmath16-network @xcite using the srinath - rajan ( sr ) stbc @xcite assumed local channel knowledge .",
    "assumption of no csit would make things difficult .",
    "even the js scheme assumed global csit , i.e. , knowledge of all the channel gains at all the transmitters , to achieve sum dof of @xmath0 .",
    "the challenge in extending the ljj scheme to a general @xmath14-network is to identify stbcs that could be applied in the @xmath14-network with appropriate modifications .",
    "this was done for @xmath17 in @xcite where the sr stbc fitted nicely into the extended ljj scheme .",
    "this work aims to extend the ljj scheme to the @xmath18-network . as in the ljj scheme and the extended ljj scheme for the @xmath16-network using the sr stbc ,",
    "the performance metrics are the achievable sum dof and the diversity gain .",
    "the contributions of this work are summarized below .",
    "* we propose an stbc that encodes @xmath19 complex symbols per channel use ( cspcu ) for a three transmit antenna single user mimo system .",
    "we use this stbc in the extended ljj scheme to achieve the maximum sum dof of @xmath5 in the @xmath18-network ( theorem [ thm2 ] , section [ sec4 ] ) . like the ljj scheme",
