    "the components of binary systems are usually assumed to share the same origins and to have identical chemical compositions .",
    "several studies , however , find that the elemental abundance differences in stellar binaries are in fact not uncommon @xcite .",
    "the sources of these abundance deviations remain unknown but one possible explanation is that any elemental abundance differences could relate to the processes of planet formation . it is well established that the dwarfs and sub - giants with higher metallicity have higher probability to form giant planets @xcite yet the situation for the giants is still uncertain @xcite . meanwhile whether planet formation can affect the chemical compositions of the host stars is less clear .",
    "@xcite found small but statistically significant anomalies in the solar chemical composition compared to most solar twins and argued that these were due to the formation of terrestrial planets in the solar system that preferentially locked - up refractory elements ( i.e. those easily condensing ) ; the deficiency of refractory elements in the solar photosphere would disappear if some four earth - masses of terrestrial planet material would be added into the present solar convective envelope @xcite .",
    "@xcite also found that the stars found _ not _ to have a close - in giant planet are more likely to resemble the sun chemically , which suggests that the presence of close - in giant planets might prevent the formation of terrestrial planets .",
    "one could also speculate that in these systems , the smaller planets were accreted by the host stars during the migration process of jupiter - like planets , thus removing the initial stellar abundance signature imprinted by the process of planet formation .",
    "@xcite provide observational support for this idea based on kepler data .",
    "@xcite demonstrated metallicity differences in the binary system 16 cyg a+b to be @xmath5 dex ( 16 cyg a is more metal - rich than 16 cyg b ) and related it to planet formation ; 16 cyg b is known to host a giant planet with a minimum mass of 1.68 jupiter masses @xcite . on the other hand , @xcite found no such abundance differences in 16 cyg a+b .",
    "the reasons for these contrary results remain unknown but given the possible connection between planet formation and stellar host composition , there is an urgent need for additional binary systems hosting planets to be exposed to a high precision abundance analysis . here",
    "we present such a study for the hat - p-1 stellar binary , in which a close - in giant planet orbits around the secondary star @xcite ; no planet detection around the primary star has been reported .",
    "we obtained high resolution ( r = @xmath6 = 67,000 ) , high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n @xmath7 300 per pixel ) spectra of the hat - p-1 stellar binary with the high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires , @xcite ) on the 10 m keck i telescope on august 15 , 2013 . a solar spectrum with higher s / n ( @xmath7 450 per pixel ) was also obtained through observations of the asteroid iris .",
    "the wavelength coverage of these spectra is nearly complete from 380 to 800 nm .",
    "the keck - makee pipeline was used for standard echelle spectra reduction which include bias subtraction , flat - fielding , scattered - light subtraction , spectral extraction and wavelength calibration .",
    "we normalized and co - added the spectra with iraf .",
    "we started the analysis by measuring the equivalent width ( ew ) for a number of lines .",
    "our adopted line - list come mainly from solar abundance analysis of @xcite but complemented with additional largely unblended lines from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ; in a differential analysis such as ours the accuracy of the transition probabilities does not greatly influence the results .",
    "we measured the ew of each spectral line interactively using the _ splot _ task in iraf and discarded lines with equivalent width larger than 12 pm .",
    "the final atomic - line data used for our abundance analysis are listed in table a1 .",
    "we performed a 1d , local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) abundance analysis with moog 2010 version @xcite using the odfnew grid of kurucz model atmospheres @xcite ; in our differential analysis the choice of model atmospheres is inconsequential .",
    "the stellar parameters were derived using excitation and ionization balance of fei and feii lines based on a line - by - line differential analysis relative to the sun .",
    "the adopted parameters for the sun were @xmath8k , @xmath9 [ cgs ] , [ fe / h]=0.00 dex , @xmath10km / s but we stress that the exact values are not crucial for our strictly differential study .",
    "the stellar parameters for the two hat - p-1 components were then established separately using a successively refined grid of stellar atmosphere models and the derived line - by - line differential abundances [ fe / h ] , finding the combination of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , [ fe / h ] and @xmath13 that minimized the slopes in [ fei / h ] versus excitation potential and reduced equivalent width as well as the difference between [ fei / h ] and [ feii / h ] .",
    "we required the derived average [ fe / h ] to be within 0.005 dex of the value used in the model atmosphere .",
    "this iterative procedure was considered converged when the grid step - size was @xmath14 k , @xmath15 and @xmath16 km / s . no sigma clipping was implemented in this work .",
    "the final adopted stellar parameters are listed in table [ t : parameters ] , which satisfy the excitation and ionization balance in a differential sense ( fig .",
    "[ f : parameters ] ) .",
    "the uncertainties in the stellar parameters were calculated based on the procedure laid out by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , which accounts for the co - variances between changes in the stellar parameters and the differential abundances . table [ t : parameters ] lists the inferred errors , which highlights the excellent precision achieved : @xmath17 and 8k , respectively .",
    "these extremely low values for the errors correspond to the internal uncertainties of the differential method .",
    "comparisons between sets of parameters derived in different studies show that the external uncertainties are usually higher @xcite .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that the primary star is 200k hotter than the secondary star while the metallicities of the primary and secondary stars are indistinguishable within the uncertainties : [ fe / h]=@xmath0 dex ( @xmath1 = 0.033 dex ) and @xmath2 dex ( @xmath1 = 0.023 dex ) , respectively . here",
