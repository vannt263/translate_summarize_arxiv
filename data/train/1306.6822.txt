    "holm equation @xcite is obtained by considering the case when @xmath15 vanishes identically .",

    "we get rid of the nonlinear convection term , and is nothing but newton s law , which states that the acceleration is constant in the absence of forces .",
    "a well - known drawback of the change of coordinates from eulerian to lagrangian coordinates is that it doubles the dimension of the problem : we start with a scalar equation and end up with a system of dimension two .",
    "this is an important issue and we will deal with it in section [ sec : relab ] .",
    "however , in return , we gain the possibility to represent a larger class of objects or , more precisely in our case , to increase the regularity of the unknown functions .",
    "let us make this imprecise statement clearer by an example and , to do so , we drop the dependence in @xmath23 in the notation , as we look at singularities in the space variable .",
    "the function @xmath25 can be represented by its graph @xmath26 but this graph can itself be represented as a parametric curve , namely , @xmath27 and , as we know , the set of graphs is smaller than the set of parametric curves . as far as regularity is concerned , the heaviside function @xmath28 is only of bounded variation but it can be represented in lagrangian coordinates by the following pair of more regular ( in this case lipschitz ) functions @xmath29 indeed , @xmath30 and @xmath31 represent one and the same curve , except for the vertical line joining the origin to the point @xmath32 .",

    "the function @xmath20 alone can not provide this information as @xmath37 is identically zero .",
    "thus , we have to introduce an extra variable to describe the solutions . in lagrangian variables",
    ", it takes the form of the _ cumulative energy _",
    "@xmath38 , which is given by @xmath39 we will introduce later its counter - part in eulerian variables .",

    "formally , after changing variables , we have @xmath40 , so that the lagrangian variable corresponding to @xmath15 is given by @xmath41    next , we rewrite in the lagrangian variables @xmath42 .",
    "we obtain the following system @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 see @xcite for more details on this derivation .",
    "after differentiation , we obtain    [ eq : govsysder ] @xmath47    this system is semilinear and we recognize some features observed earlier for the burgers equation : we start from a nonlinear partial differential equation and we end up with a system of ordinary differential equations which is _",
    "semilinear_. we consider the system as an ordinary differential equation because the order of the spatial derivative is the same on both sides of the equation , so that the existence and uniqueness of solutions can be established by a contraction argument .",
    "finally , it is important to recall in this section the geometric nature of the camassa  holm equation .",
    "the equation is a geodesic in the group of diffeomorphism for the @xmath33 norm , see , e.g. , @xcite , as the burgers equation for the @xmath48 norm . using the connection between geometry and fluid mechanics , as presented in @xcite , the function @xmath49",
    "can then be understood as a path in the group of diffeomorphisms .",
    "thus besides the relaxation properties we have just described , this interpretation adds a direct geometrical relevance to use of lagrangian coordinates , see also @xcite for the system .",
    "in ( * ? ? ? * theorem 3.2 ) , we prove by a contraction argument that short - time solutions to exist in a banach space , which we will here denote @xmath50 and define as follows .",
    "let @xmath51 be the banach space defined by @xmath52 and the norm of @xmath51 is given by @xmath53 .",
    "we set @xmath50 @xmath54 with the following norm @xmath55 for any @xmath56 . given a constant @xmath57 , we denote by @xmath58 the ball @xmath59    short - time solutions of can not in general be extended to global solutions .",
    "the challenge is to identify an appropriate set of initial data for which one can construct global solutions that at the same time preserve the structure of the equations , allowing us to return to the eulerian variables .",
    "there are intrinsic relations between the variables in that need to be conserved by the solution .",
    "this is handled by the set @xmath60 defined below .",
    "in particular , the set @xmath60 is preserved by the flow .",

    "the condition @xmath64 implies that the mapping @xmath65 is _ almost _ a diffeomorphism .",
    "the solution develop singularities exactly when this mapping ceases to be a diffeomorphism , that is , when @xmath66 in some regions .",
    "the condition shows that the variables @xmath42 are strongly coupled .",
    "in fact , when @xmath67 , we can recover @xmath68 from .",
    "it reflects the fact that @xmath69 represents , in lagrangian coordinates , the energy density of @xmath20 and @xmath15 ( that is , @xmath70 in eulerian coordinates ) and therefore , when the solution is smooth , it can be computed from the variables @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "note that the coupling between @xmath68 and @xmath74 disappears when @xmath66 , which is precisely the moment when collisions occur and when we need the information @xmath68 provides on the energy to prolong the solution .",
    "the identity makes also clear the smoothing property of the camassa  holm system . if @xmath75 for some constant @xmath76 , this property is preserved and then @xmath77 never vanishes .",
    "the solution keeps the same degree of regularity it has initially , see @xcite .    as in (",

    "the equations are well - posed in lagrangian coordinates .",
    "we want to transport this result back to eulerian coordinates .",
    "if the two sets of coordinates were in bijection , then it would be straightforward but , as mentioned earlier , lagrangian coordinates increase the number of unknowns from two ( @xmath20 and @xmath15 ) to four ( the components of @xmath90 ) , which indicates that such a bijection does not exist .",
    "there exists a redundancy in lagrangian coordinates and the goal of this section is precisely to identify this redundancy , in order to be able to define the correct equivalence classes .",
    "this redundancy is also present in the case of the burgers equation when we define the cauchy problem for both and . to the initial condition @xmath91 for",

    "we will use the term _ relabeling _ for this lack of uniqueness in the characterization of one and the same curve .",

    "this corresponds to the relabeling action .",

    "we consider instead the section defined by @xmath116 , which contains one and only one representative for each equivalence class , so that the quotient @xmath117 is in bijection with @xmath116 .",
