    "a quantitative description of the interaction of charged particles with matter is of basic importance in many different theoretical and applied areas@xcite .",
    "when an ion penetrates condensed matter it causes changes in the charge state of the ion , electrons may be stripped from the ion or captured from electronic states of the solid , dynamic screening by valence electrons originates a wake of electron density fluctuations , and the ion may lose energy to the medium through different types of elastic and inelastic collision processes .",
    "when a swift electron travels in a solid it may also lose energy to the medium . while at relativistic velocities radiative losses may become important , for incident charged particles in the non - relativistic regime the significant energy losses appear as a consequence of electron - electron interactions giving rise to the generation of electron - hole pairs , collective oscillations , and inner - shell excitations and ionizations .",
    "since the pioneering works of bohm and pines@xcite the response of conduction electrons in metals to external charged particles has been represented within the electron gas model , by replacing the ionic lattice by a homogeneous background which serves to provide neutrality to the system .",
    "the screening properties of a system of interacting electrons are determined , within linear response theory , by the wavevector and frequency dependent longitudinal dielectric function @xmath1 . in the self - consistent field , or random - phase ,",
    "approximation , the dielectric function of an electron gas was first derived by lindhard@xcite , and , subsequently , a number of workers have given alternative expressions for @xmath1 , incorporating various many - body higher order local - field corrections@xcite and band effects@xcite .",
    "the effect of dissipative processes occurring in a real metal and conversion of plasmons into multiple electron - hole pairs may be allowed for in an approximate way by including a damping coefficient in the dielectric function@xcite .    nevertheless , the validity of linear response theory , which treats the perturbing potential to lowest order , is not obvious a priori .",
    "although lowest - order perturbation theory leads to energy losses that are proportional to the square of the projectile charge@xcite , @xmath2 , from measurements on positive and negative pions@xcite and , also , on protons and antiprotons@xcite it is known that the energy loss exhibits a dependence on the sign of the charge@xcite@xmath3@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "experimentally observed nonlinear double plasmon excitations@xcite can not be described within linear response theory@xcite , and nonlinearities may also play an important role on the electronic wake generated by moving ions in an electron gas@xcite .",
    "finally , lowest order perturbation theory breaks down when the projectile is capable of carrying bound electrons with it@xcite .",
    "the first full nonlinear calculation of the electronic stopping power of an electron gas was performed by echenique et al@xcite , in the low - velocity limit .",
    "they used a scattering theory approach to the stopping power and the scattering cross sections were calculated for a statically screened potential which was determined self - consistently by using density - functional theory .",
    "these static screening calculations have recently been extended to velocities approaching the fermi velocity@xcite .",
    "alternatively , in the case of incident ions a theoretical effective charge can be associated@xcite , and nonlinearities can be investigated , within quadratic response theory , extending , therefore , the range of linear response theory and providing results for arbitrary velocity .",
    "a quadratic response theory of the energy loss of charged particles in an electron gas has recently been carried out@xcite , by following a diagrammatic analysis of many - body interactions between a moving charge and the electron gas .    in this paper",
    "we present a survey of the theoretical status of investigations carried out within quadratic response theory for the understanding of nonlinear aspects in the interaction of charged particles with an electron gas .",
    "we present general procedures to calculate , within many - body perturbation theory , double plasmon excitation probabilities , @xmath4 contributions to the stopping power of an electron gas for ions and the nonlinear wake potential generated by moving ions in an electron gas .",
    "we focus on the contribution to the stopping power coming from the excitation of single and double plasmons .",
    "unless otherwise is stated , atomic units are used throughout ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "we consider a probe of charge @xmath6 interacting with a many - particle system .",
    "the excitation of eigenmodes of the target together with the reaction of the probe to these excitations can be described by the self - energy of the probe . for an incoming particle in a state @xmath7 of energy @xmath8 one writes@xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 represents the non - local self - energy .",
    "the real part of @xmath11 gives us the real energy shift due to the interaction with the medium , and the imaginary part is well - known to be directly related to the damping rate experienced by the particle as a consequence of the interaction with real excitations of the target : @xmath12    we take the target to be described by an isotropic homogeneous assembly of electrons immersed in a uniform background of positive charge and volume @xmath13 , and we use , therefore , plane waves to describe the incident particle states .",
    "consequently , @xmath14 where @xmath15 represents the fourier transform of @xmath10 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the momentum of the probe .",
    "the self - energy , @xmath15 , can be calculated in the so - called gw approximation@xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent fourier transforms of the green function for the probe and the time - ordered screened interaction , respectively . in applying this formula",
    "we replace @xmath19 by the zero order approximation ; for electrons ( @xmath21)@xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 is a positive infinitesimal , and @xmath25 represents the occupation number , which at a temperature of @xmath26 is @xmath27 @xmath28 being the fermi momentum and @xmath29 , the heaviside function .",
    "the dynamically screened interaction , @xmath20 , can be represented as follows : @xmath30 where @xmath31 represents the fourier transform of the bare coulomb interaction : @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the dielectric function , which is related to the density - density response function , @xmath34 , by : @xmath35    now , introduction of eqs .",

    "when the probe is not an electron the occupation number of eq .",
    "( 2.6 ) is zero , i.e. , we need not take account of the fact that the incident electron can not make transitions to occupied states in the fermi sea : @xmath41 and if the probe has mass @xmath42 , then recoil can be neglected in the argument of the delta function to give : @xmath43 where @xmath44 represents the velocity of the incoming particle .",
    "the inverse mean free path of the probe is easily obtained as follows : @xmath45 and the stopping power of the target for the probe is obtained as the energy loss per unit path length of the projectile , after multiplying the probability @xmath37 by the energy transfer @xmath46 : @xmath47    in the so - called time - dependent hartree , or random - phase , approximation the exact linear response function to a screened charge is replaced by the response function of the non - interacting electron gas : @xmath48 thus replacing the linear response function to an external charge , @xmath34 , by @xmath49    within this approximation the self - energy of eq .",

    "( 2.7 ) .",
    "then , the probability of transferring four - momentum @xmath53 to a free - electron gas by moving a particle from inside the fermi sea ( @xmath54 ) to outside ( @xmath55 ) , thus creating an electron - hole pair , is derived from the square of the matrix element @xmath56 : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the symmetric kronecker @xmath59 symbol , and introduction of eq . ( 2.18 ) into eq .",
    "( 2.19 ) gives exactly the result of eq .",
    "( 2.13 ) found by the self - energy method .",
    "it is obvious at this point that double plasmon excitations can not be described within the gw - rpa approximation to the self - energy , represented diagrammatically in fig .",
    "1 ; double excitations can only be described , within the gw approximation , with inclusion in the screened interaction of dynamic local - field corrections . on the other hand , the study of @xmath4 effects in the stopping power of an electron gas for ions and , also , the study of non - linearities in the wake generated by moving ions in an electron gas require going beyond the so - called gw approximation .",
    "the main ingredient in the investigation of both double plasmon excitations and @xmath4 effects is the symmetrized quadratic response function of the non - interacting electron gas : @xmath60,\\label{33}\\ ] ] which gives account of the quadratic response of the system to a given charge .",
    "the real part of this three - point function was first evaluated by cenni et al@xcite , explicit expressions for the imaginary part in terms of a sum over hole and particle states have been presented recently@xcite , and an extension to imaginary frequencies has also been given@xcite .      treating the probe as an external source of energy and momentum , the matrix element corresponding to the process of carrying the system from an initial state @xmath61 to a final state @xmath62 is @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the vacuum state , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are annihilation and creation operators for fermions , respectively , and @xmath67 is the scattering matrix .",
    "@xmath67 is obtained as a time - ordered exponential in terms of the perturbing hamiltonian and field operators @xmath68 and @xmath69 destroying and creating , respectively , a particle at the point @xmath70 at the time @xmath71 .",
    "now , one can apply wick s theorem , we note that only normal ordered products with four uncontracted field operators contribute , and we find , up to second order in the probe charge a result that can be represented diagrammatically as in fig .",
    "2 . within the random - phase approximation , the screened interaction , @xmath20 ,",
    "is obtained from eqs .",

    "also , ladder contributions have not been introduced into eq .",
    "( 2.21 ) , since they all lead to scattering probabilities that are of a higher order in the screened interaction .",
    "finally , the probability for transferring four - momentum @xmath53 to a free - electron gas by moving two particles from inside the fermi sea ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) to outside ( @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) is derived from the square of the matrix element @xmath76 : @xmath77    if the probe were not a heavy particle , then recoil should be introduced into the argument of the delta function to ensure energy conservation , and , in particular , if the probe were an electron an step function should also be introduced to ensure that the probe does not lose enough energy to fall below the fermi level .",

    "in particular , the only @xmath78 contribution to the probability of eq . ( 2.22 ) which might represent the real excitation of a double plasmon comes from the square of the scattering amplitude represented by the second diagram of fig .",

( 2.35 ) and ( 2.36 ) both appear as a consequence of single excitations : the first one comes from the cross product between the first and third diagrams of fig . 3 , and gives , therefore , the contribution from losses to one - step single excitations generated by the quadratically screened ion potential , while the second term comes from the cross product between the first and second diagrams of fig . 3 and gives the contribution from losses to two - step single excitations generated by the linearly screened ion potential .",
    "the third term comes from both cross products , and , also , from losses to double excitations .",
    "contributions coming from single plasmons are included in both @xmath103 and @xmath105 , and contributions coming from the excitation of double plasmons are only included in @xmath105 .",
    "alternatively , the stopping power of an electron gas can be obtained from the knowledge of the wake potential induced in the vicinity of the projectile , as the induced retarding force that the polarization charge distribution exerts on the projectile itself , and a second - order many body perturbation analysis of the wake potential@xcite at , defined as the mean value of the interaction between a test unit positive charge at that point and the electron gas , leads to eq .",
    "( 2.34 ) for the @xmath4 stopping power , as demonstrated in ref ..    for high velocities of the probe the electron gas can be considered as if it were at rest , one can use , therefore , the so - called static electron gas approximation for both linear and quadratic response functions , and this results in @xmath104 and @xmath105 giving no contribution to the integral of eq .",
    "( 2.34 ) , i.e. , in the high - velocity limit only the contribution to the @xmath4 stopping power that is proportional to only - one imaginary part of the linearly screened interaction , @xmath20 , is different from zero .",

    "then , we find second and third order wake potentials and electronic stopping powers , and , also , double plasmon excitation probabilities that coincide with plasmon - pole like approximations to the full rpa results@xcite .",

    "( 3.1 ) gives a good account of the full rpa result for both incident electrons and positrons in a wide range of projectile velocities .",
    "in particular , for aluminum and an incident electron energy of @xmath113 we find from eq .",
    "( 3.1 ) a ratio for the double relative to the single plasmon of @xmath114 , in agreement with the experiment@xcite .",
    "contributions to the stopping power that are proportional to @xmath78 and @xmath4 , as obtained from eqs .",
    "( 2.29 ) and ( 2.34 ) , are plotted in fig . 5 by solid lines , as a function of the velocity , again for @xmath83 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that both @xmath78 and @xmath4 contributions to the stopping power exhibit a linear dependence on the velocity up to velocities approaching the stopping maximum ; this linear dependence has , also , been observed for the low - velocity stopping power when it is calculated to all orders in the probe charge on the basis of density functional theory@xcite .",
    "the linear dependence of the @xmath4 correction to the stopping power is , however , a consequence of two competing effects .",
    "first , there is the effect of one - step single excitations generated by the quadratically screened ion potential , represented by a dashed line in the same figure , and , then , the effect of two - step single excitations generated by the linearly screened ion potential , represented by a dashed - dotted line .",
    "the contribution from losses to two - step single excitations , represented by @xmath104 of eq .",
    "( 2.36 ) , is very small , at high velocities , when the velocity distribution of target electrons can be neglected . in this case",
    "the static electron gas approximation can be made , the only non - vanishing contribution to the @xmath4 effect comes , in this approximation , from @xmath103 of eq .",
    "( 2.35 ) , i. e. , from losses to one - step single excitations generated by the quadratically screened ion potential , and one finds that the result obtained in this approximation is well reproduced by eq .",
    "( 2.38 ) , represented in fig . 5 by a dotted line .",
    "this approximation gives a good account of the full rpa result , even at intermediate velocities where the velocity of target electrons is not negligible , and this is , again , a consequence of two competing effects .",
    "first , the non - negligible motion of the electron gas gives rise to a smaller contribution from losses to one - step single excitations , and this is almost compensated by the non - vanishing contribution from losses to two - step single excitations .",
    "contributions from losses to double excitations are small in a wide range of projectile velocities and they are exactly equal to zero as far as the electron gas can be considered to be at rest .    in order to analyze the contribution to the nonlinear stopping power coming from losses to collective excitations , we first show in fig .",
    "6 the separate contributions to the linear term from plasmon excitation and electron - hole pair excitation by the incident particle . for a momentum transfer that is smaller than @xmath115 , the critical wave vector where the plasmon dispersion enters the electron - hole pair excitation spectrum ,",
    "both the plasmon and the electron - hole pair excitation contribute to the energy loss , though contributions from losses from electron - hole pair excitations are very small . for @xmath116",
    ", however , only the excitation of electron - hole pairs contributes .",
    "total contributions to the @xmath78 stopping power coming from @xmath117 and @xmath116 are shown in fig .",
    "7 , and contributions coming from @xmath118 and @xmath119 are plotted in fig .",
    "8 , @xmath120 being the low - density limit of @xmath115 .",
    "contributions to the stopping power coming from losses to plasmons is , therefore , smaller than contributions from losses to electron - hole pairs , especially at high electron - densities , though there is , at high velocities , exact equipartition of the energy loss corresponding to momentum transfers larger than and smaller than @xmath120 .",
    "this equipartition rule appears straightforwardly in the electron gas at rest approximation , and it has been formulated , for an electron gas not at rest , by lindhard and winther@xcite .",
    "this equipartition is , also , found to be exact , in the high velocity limit , by using coulomb scattering of independent electrons with @xmath121 or by assuming that independent electrons are scattered by a velocity dependent yukawa potential with screening length proportional to @xmath122 .    as far as the @xmath4 stopping power is concerned , we have split the contributions to @xmath103 from losses to single plasmons and single electron - hole pairs , and we have found the result shown in fig .",
    "9 by dashed and dotted lines , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "all contributions to @xmath104 , represented in this figure by a dashed - dotted line , come from losses to electron - hole pairs .",
    "thus , it is obvious from this figure that contributions to the @xmath4 effect coming from losses to plasmons is small , showing that nonlinear corrections to losses from single plasmons are not important , and that collective exitations appear to be well described by linearly screened ion potentials .",
    "the equipartition rule , valid within first order perturbation theory and/or a linear response theory of the electron gas , can not be extended , therefore , to higher orders in the external perturbation .",
    "finally , in order to account approximately for the @xmath4 effect coming from both the conduction band and the inner - shells , a local plasma approximation has been used , by assuming that a local fermi energy can be attributed to each element of the solid , and experimental differences between the stopping power of silicon for protons and antiprotons have been successfully explained in this way@xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have developed a quadratic response theory for the understanding of nonlinear aspects in the interaction of charged particles with matter . in the frame of many - body perturbation theory ,",
    "we have studied the interaction of charged particles with the electron gas , within the random - phase - approximation , and in particular , the nonlinear wake potential generated by moving ions in matter , the @xmath4 correction to the stopping power , and processes involved in multiple excitations of electron - hole pairs and plasmons .",
    "double plasmon mean free paths for incident electrons and positrons , and , also , second order contributions to the stopping power coming from the excitation of single and double plasmons have been evaluated , for the first time , in the full rpa , as a function of the velocity of the projectile .",

    "<S> a survey is presented of the theoretical status of quadratic response theories for the understanding of nonlinear aspects in the interaction of charged particles with matter . in the frame of the many - body perturbation theory we study the interaction of charged particles with the electron gas , within the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> nonlinear corrections to the stopping power of an electron gas for ions are analyzed , and special emphasis is made on the contribution to the stopping power coming from the excitation of single and double plasmons . </S>",
    "<S> double plasmon mean free paths of swift electrons passing through an electron gas are also discussed .    </S>",
