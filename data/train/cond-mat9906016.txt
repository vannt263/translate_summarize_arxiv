    "the nonlinear optical ( nlo ) properties on conjugated polymers have always been received wide interest for study.@xcite experimentally observed nonlinear phenomenon in conducting polymers , such as photoinduced absorption , bleaching , photoluminescence , ultrafast optical process and exciton behaviors,@xcite have already encouraged the theorists for the possible explanations.@xcite    in the early 90s , the large third order susceptibility ( @xmath3 ) of trans - polyacetylene ( pa ) have been observed experimentally@xcite and have been received wide explanations theoretically.@xcite for a long time , the origin of the experimentally observed two - photon absorption peak ( tpa)@xcite receives persistent discussions in theory.@xcite based on the static current - current correlation ( @xmath1)@xcite and followed by keldysh green function methods@xcite , tpa could be interpreted through the analytical forms under both ssh@xcite and tlm models@xcite for infinite chains .",
    "besides the unnecessary application of nonequilibrium diagram techniques in a stable optical response problem,@xcite however , the various numerical approaches from dipole formalism(@xmath4 ) , such as the results by yu and su@xcite from butcher - bloembergen - shen dipole formula,@xcite the results by wu and sun@xcite from genkins - mednis approach@xcite and the results by shuai and brdas from sum - over - state(sos ) orr - ward formalism,@xcite have shown that the tpa is no longer existing if the damping in the energy is considered.@xcite therefore , the two - photon cusp under the current schemes is considered to be a van hove singularity@xcite caused by the singular density of states ( dos ) on the fermi surface in one - dimensional ( @xmath5 ) systems . the fact of the nonresonant property in two - photon cusp is also noticed by wu in his current formulations.@xcite however , besides the difficulty in explaining this tpa under current formulas , there exists another obvious difficulty in theory  apparent zero frequency divergence ( zfd ) in the definition of the current formalism.@xcite this problem actually was realized by dakhnovskii and pronin in their computations based on ssh model.@xcite unfortunately , the results of @xmath3 obtained from ssh model returns tlm model if the process of linearization procedures is made under @xmath1 scheme.@xcite    because of the apparent divergence difficulties in current formulas@xcite , practically , intense studies based on dipole - dipole ( @xmath0 ) correlation have been carried out to obtain the physical pictures of tpa in @xmath3 of trans - polyacetylene .",
    "on one hand , the weakly correlated and single electron theories are applied in the numerical dipole computations , thus , the finite size effect@xcite and the lifetime assumption@xcite are seemingly good in generating a peak at exact position of tpa ; on the other hand , the strongly correlated electron theories have also been applied to short chains , soos and ramesesha obtained the tpa based on pariser - parr - pople ( ppp ) models , but it is shifted too low in frequency and has too small an intensity@xcite relative to the experimental peak.@xcite recent work by guo and mazumdar shows that this tpa could be interpreted as a three - photon resonance based on extended hubbard hamiltonian.@xcite whether or not the weakly correlated theory or even the single electron models such as ssh and tlm models are still suitable in describing tpa still remains as a question . meanwhile , in obtaining the qualitatively correct result , it was suggested by etemad and soos that the attention should be made to the @xmath3 frequency dependences rather than magnitudes.@xcite it is certainly reasonable in physical point of view since the experiments are more sensitive to detect frequency dependences .",
    "thus , some typical approximations are made in the dipole formula .",
    "substitution of the dipole operator @xmath6 by the polarization operator @xmath2 , namely , the dipole approximation@xcite has been extensively applied in the nonlinear optical formula , however , @xmath7 computations have shown both quantitatively and qualitatively different results between @xmath2 and dipole operator @xmath6.@xcite whether the problem caused by the dipole approximation still existing in @xmath3 is still under our concern .",
    "furthermore , the static dipole formulas@xcite and static current formulas@xcite are conventionally considered to be equivalent.@xcite however , as we pointed out in a recent work,@xcite it has zfd problem in the static current formalism when the gauge phase factor is ignored , the static formalism under two gauges should not return the same results under the exact same basis of unperturbed wave functions.@xcite whether this nonequivalence between @xmath1 and @xmath0 correlations existing in the specific case of @xmath3 of trans - polyacetylene is another interest topic .",
    "although the qualitative features have already been reported in the numerical solutions based on @xmath0 correlation,@xcite the exact analytical solutions from the dipole formulas of @xmath3 have not been obtained previously .",
    "the analytical results , if obtained , will be very helpful for us to directly check all above concerns and give more information .    fortunately , both ssh and tlm models are single electron models and can be exactly solvable for the nonlinear susceptibilities under perturbated schemes , although the efforts will be no doubt paid to cumbersome computations . after choosing the long wavelength approximation which are conventionally used previously,@xcite we could directly compared those analytical results between two gauges for both models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows , we will first discuss the ssh hamiltonian in sec.ii.a .",
    "the analytical form of @xmath3 by the dipole - dipole ( dd ) correlation is obtained and compared with the analytical form by @xmath1 correlation for ssh models in sec.ii.b . in sec.ii.c",
    ", we will obtain the results under the polarization operator @xmath2 , the qualitative and quantitative difference between the results under @xmath6 and @xmath2 are outlined . in sec.iii , we will obtain the exact analytical forms under @xmath0 correlation for tlm models and directly compared with those under @xmath1 correlation .",
    "the discussions on the possible implications of this work are made in sec.iv and a brief conclusion is made in sec.v .",
    "based on periodic tight - binding - approximations , the ssh hamiltonian@xcite is given by : @xmath8 ( \\hat{c}_{l+1,s}^{\\dag}\\hat{c}_{l , s}^{}+\\hat{c}_{l , s}^{\\dag}\\hat{c}_{l+1,s})^ { } , \\label{hssh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the transfer integral between the nearest - neighbor sites , @xmath10 is the gap parameter and @xmath11 creates(annihilates ) an @xmath12 electron at site @xmath13 with spin @xmath14 . in continuum limitation , above ssh model will give the tlm model.@xcite for the ssh model , each site is occupied by one electron .    under the @xmath0 correlation ,",
    "the interaction hamiltonian is expressed by @xmath15 , to provide the periodic property and to avoid the ill - definition of position operator @xmath16 , we should express the position operator @xmath16 under the bloch states : @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are band index and crystal momentum correspondingly , @xmath20 is the periodic function under the translation of lattice vector.@xcite thus , we obtain : @xmath21 and @xmath22 where @xmath23 is unit cell volume .",

    "<S> the analytical solutions for the third - harmonic generation ( thg ) on infinite chains in both su - shrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) and takayama - lin - liu - maki ( tlm ) models of trans - polyacetylene are obtained through the scheme of dipole - dipole ( @xmath0 ) correlation . </S>",
