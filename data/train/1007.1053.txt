    "this program can be realized in terms of a quark operator expansion , which gives rise to a physical picture similar to the one of the phenomenological quark models , but is closer connected to qcd . in this context",
    "quark models gain additional significance .",
    "the @xmath0 expansion has been applied both to the ground state and excited nucleons @xcite . in the system of negative parity @xmath2 excited baryons",
    "this approach has yielded a number of interesting insights for the spin - flavor structure of the quark interaction .    in a recent paper @xcite",
    "we showed how to match an arbitrary quark model hamiltonian onto the operators of the @xmath0 expansion , thus making the connection between these two physical pictures .",
    "this method makes use of the transformation of the states and operators under @xmath3 , the permutation group of @xmath4 objects acting on the spin - flavor degrees of the quarks .",

    "the main result of @xcite can be summarized as follows : consider a two - body quark hamiltonian @xmath7 , where @xmath8 acts on the spin - flavor quark degrees of freedom and @xmath9 acts on the orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "then the hadronic matrix elements of the quark hamiltonian on a baryon state @xmath10 contains only the projections @xmath11 of @xmath8 onto a few irreducible representations of @xmath3 and can be factorized as @xmath12 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath13 are related to reduced matrix elements of the orbital operators @xmath9 , and are given by overlap integrals of the quark model wave functions .",
    "the matching procedure has been discussed in detail for the isgur - karl ( ik ) model in ref .",

    "@xcite we used the general @xmath1 approach to study the predictions of the quark model with the most general two - body quark interactions , and to obtain information about the spin - flavor structure of the quark interactions from the observed spectrum of the @xmath2 negative parity baryons .",
    "this talk summarizes the main ideas and emphasizes their relevance as a possible test for three - body forces in excited baryons .",
    "the isgur - karl model is defined by the quark hamiltonian @xmath14 where @xmath15 contains the confining potential and kinetic terms of the quark fields , and is symmetric under spin and isospin .",

    "@xcite the confining forces are harmonic .",
    "we will derive in the following the form of the mass operator without making any assumption on the shape of the confining quark forces .",
    "we refer to this more general version of the model as ik - v(r ) .",
    "the @xmath2 quark model states include the following su(3 ) multiplets : two spin-1/2 octets @xmath21 , two spin-3/2 octets @xmath22 , one spin-5/2 octet @xmath23 , two decuplets @xmath24 and two singlets @xmath25",
    ". states with the same quantum numbers mix . for the @xmath26 states we define the relevant mixing angle @xmath27 in the nonstrange sector as @xmath28 and similar equations for the @xmath29 states , which define a second mixing angle @xmath30 .",
    "we find @xcite that the most general mass operator in the ik - v(r ) model depends only on three unknown orbital overlap integrals , plus an additive constant @xmath31 related to the matrix element of @xmath15 , and can be written as @xmath32 where the spin - flavor operators are understood to act on the state @xmath33 constructed as a tensor product of the core of quarks 2,3 and the ` excited ' quark 1 , as given in @xcite .",

    "( [ ikmass ] ) @xmath40 we recover the well known result that in the harmonic oscillator model , the entire spectroscopy of the @xmath2 baryons is fixed by one single constant @xmath41 , along with an overall additive constant @xmath31 , and the model becomes very predictive .    in fig .",

    "their detailed form is unimportant for our considerations .",
    "the scalar , spin - orbit and tensor parts of the interaction yield factors of @xmath47 , which are coupled to the spin - flavor part of the interaction as shown in table  i of ref .",
    "@xcite    following refs .",
    "@xcite one finds that the most general form of the effective mass operator in the presence of these two - body quark interactions is a linear combination of 10 nontrivial spin - flavor operators @xmath48 and the unit operator .",
    "it turns out that the 11 coefficients @xmath49 contribute to the mass operator of the negative parity @xmath50 states only in 9 independent combinations : @xmath51 .",
    "this implies the existence of two universal relations among the masses of the 9 multiplets plus the two mixing angles , which must hold in any quark model containing only two - body quark interactions .",
    "the first universal relation involves only the nonstrange hadrons , and requires only isospin symmetry .",
