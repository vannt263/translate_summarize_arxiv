    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) superconducting arrays with charging effects have drawn much interest because of their interesting phase transitions  @xcite and relations to other systems such as the bose - hubbard model and the quantum @xmath1 spin model  @xcite . in those arrays where both the self - capacitance @xmath2 and the junction capacitance @xmath3 are present , charging energies due to both capacitances need to be considered simultaneously since the nature of the phase transition in general depends on them .",
    "for example , at zero temperature the system with only self - capacitance can be mapped into a classical three - dimensional ( 3d ) @xmath0 model with the ratio @xmath4 of the charging energy @xmath5 to the josephson coupling strength @xmath6 taking the role of the temperature . in the opposite limit , on the other hand , it is well known that there exists an interesting duality between charges and vortices  @xcite , and the system with only junction capacitance at zero temperature undergoes a charge - unbinding berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition  @xcite from the insulating phase to the superconducting one as the ratio @xmath7 with @xmath8 is increased . the critical value @xmath9 , beyond which the array is superconducting , has been found @xmath10 in experiment  @xcite , @xmath11 in the duality argument  @xcite and in the variational method  @xcite , @xmath12 in perturbation expansion  @xcite , and @xmath13 in quantum monte carlo simulations  @xcite . as @xmath2",
    "is increased from zero in this system , the interactions between charges are screened , with the screening length given by @xmath14  @xcite , and the nature of the phase transition is expected to alter .",
    "recently , the zero - temperature phase diagrams have been studied by means of the perturbation expansion  @xcite , which suggests that the phase transition from the mott insulating phase to the superconducting phase is governed by the single - charge ( sc ) excitations or by the charge - dipole ( cd ) excitations , depending on the ratio @xmath15 as well as on the charge frustration .    in this paper",
    ", we study the quantum phase transitions in 2d superconducting arrays , focusing on the effects of external magnetic fields as well as the competition between self- and junction capacitances .",
    "the effects of external magnetic fields on phase transitions have been studied both in the classical arrays without charging energy  @xcite and in the quantum arrays  @xcite .",
    "however , most existing analytical works on the latter have employed mean - field - like approximations , which are not reliable in two dimensions .",
    "we thus adopt the perturbative expansion instead , and consider the sc and the cd excitations to the second order in @xmath6 . the obtained phase boundaries between the mott insulating phase and the superconducting one exhibit strong commensurability effects due to the magnetic frustration .",
    "the results are compared with experiments , suggesting the possibility that the experimentally observed transition may not be of the charge - unbinding bkt type .",
    "it is also shown that the dual transformation maps the system with both magnetic frustration and general capacitance onto a classical 3d @xmath0 model under the magnetic field in the time - direction .",
    "this transformation allows us to discuss the nature of the phase transitions , by analogy with bulk superconductors under magnetic fields .",
    "there are four sections in this paper : section  ii is devoted to the perturbative approach , from which the zero - temperature diagrams are obtained .",
    "we compare the phase diagrams with those obtained from the mean - field approach and those observed in experiments . in sec .",
    "iii the system is transformed into a classical 3d @xmath0 model under the magnetic field in the ( imaginary ) time direction .",
    "the nature of the phase transitions is discussed by analogy with bulk superconductors under magnetic fields .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "iv summarizes the results and presents some discussions .",
    "we begin with the hamiltonian describing the superconducting array with magnetic frustration : @xmath16 where the charge @xmath17 at site @xmath18 represented in units of @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) and the phase @xmath21 of the superconducting order parameter at site @xmath22 satisfy the commutation relation @xmath23 = i\\delta_{jk}$ ] .",
    "whereas the summation in the second term runs over all nearest neighboring pairs , the charges interact via the inverse of the dimensionless capacitance matrix @xmath24 defined by    ' '' ''    ' '' ''",
    "@xmath25    ' '' ''    2 with the self - capacitance @xmath2 and the junction capacitance @xmath3 . the important external parameters @xmath26 and @xmath6 measure the self - charging energy and the josephson coupling energy , respectively .",
    "the magnetic bond angle @xmath27 between the two sites @xmath28 and @xmath18 is given by the line integral of the magnetic vector potential @xmath29 : @xmath30 with the magnetic flux quantum @xmath31 .    when @xmath32 , the system described by the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath33 has the mott insulating phase as the ground state with the charge configuration @xmath34 at any site . in the opposite limit of @xmath35 , on the other hand , the system is described by the 2d classical @xmath0 model , displaying superconductivity at zero temperature .",
    "it is thus expected that there exists a critical value of @xmath36 beyond which the superconducting phase becomes energetically favorable .",
    "the critical value may be determined by comparing the energy of the mott insulating phase with that of the superconducting phase .",
    "the energy @xmath37 of the mott insulating phase is easily computed up to the second order in @xmath36 : @xmath38 for the @xmath39 square array @xmath40 ( see ref .   for the detailed calculation ) .",
    "it is of interest to note here that @xmath37 does not depend on the external magnetic field .    since the lowest excitation that can lead to the change of the ground state from the mott insulating into the superconducting phase is presumably point - like , and we consider two kinds of excitations : the sc and the cd excitations .",
    "we first consider the sc - type excited state and write its energy up to the second order in @xmath36 : @xmath41 in the sc - type excited state a single positive charge is located only at one site , and the zeroth - order energy is given by @xmath42 since the single charge can be located at any site without any energy difference , we need to make use of the degenerate perturbation theory . in the first order it is thus necessary to diagonalize the matrix @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the charge eigenstate with the single charge at site @xmath28 and the matrix element @xmath45 is defined by    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    @xmath46    ' '' ''    2 in the presence of the external magnetic field , the gauge - invariant magnetic frustration is defined by @xmath47 with @xmath48 being the magnetic flux per plaquette .",

    "indeed it has recently been pointed out that the absence of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless charge - unbinding transition in experiments  @xcite may be attributed to the presence of the finite charge frustration which is randomly distributed over the arrays  @xcite .",
