    "though we can detect some gas and dust disks as well as large planets around stars , we will not be able to detect extra - solar planetesimals on the kilometer to thousands of kilometer size scale in the foreseeable future .",

    "the orbits of objects in the main asteroid belt , kuiper belt and trojan regions have been highly influenced by the migration and evolution of the solar system .",
    "since trojan asteroids share their planet s orbital period and semi - major axis they are especially useful in constraining the formation and migration of their planet ( morbidelli et al .",
    "2005 ; tsiganis et al . 2005 ) .",
    "trojan asteroids lead ( l4 ) or trail ( l5 ) a planet by about sixty degrees near the two triangular lagrangian points of gravitational stability .",
    "the jupiter trojans have been known since max wolf discovered 588 achilles in 1906 .",
    "there are currently about 3000 known trojans in the l4 and l5 regions of jupiter .",
    "neptune s first trojan was discovered within the l4 region in 2001 while several more neptune trojans have been discovered in recent years ( chiang et al .",
    "2003 ; sheppard & trujillo 2006 , 2010 ; becker et al .",
    "the other giant planets saturn and uranus are not expected to have a significant number of trojans since their lagrangian regions are more dynamically unstable over the age of the solar system ( nesvorny & dones 2002 ) .",
    "the dynamics of kuiper belt objects in outer mean - motion resonances with neptune , such as the 3:2 and 2:1 resonances , suggest that neptune likely migrated several au outwards during its lifetime ( hahn & malhotra 2005 ; chiang & lithwick 2005 ; levison et al . 2008 ) .",
    "similarly , the hildas in the main asteroid belt are in the 2:3 mean - motion resonance with jupiter and their orbital distribution suggests jupiter migrated inward by a few tenths of au ( franklin et al .",
    "2004 ) . unlike these inner and outer resonance objects , the trojans , which are in a 1:1 resonance with their respective planet ,",
    "would likely have been depleted during any large , irregular planetary migration .",
    "the capture of trojans in the current solar system is not an effective process and thus capture happened when the solar system dynamics were significantly different than now ( horner & evans 2006 ) .",
    "thus the trojans were likely captured during either a slow smooth planetary migration process or more likely after any significant planetary migration through a neptune freeze - in circularization process ( kortenkamp et al .",
    "2004 ; morbidelli et al . 2005 ; sheppard & trujillo 2006 ; li et al .",
    "2007 ; nesvorny & vokrouhlicky 2009 ; lykawka et al . 2009 ) . both the l4 and l5",
    "neptune trojan regions appear to have similar sized populations and dynamics .",
    "the expected large number of high inclination neptune trojans in both the l4 and l5 regions of neptune suggests that capture occurred with a dynamically excited planetesimal population ( sheppard & trujillo 2010 ) .",
    "observations were obtained in june 2008 and 2009 for the l5 region and october 2004 - 2009 for the l4 region of neptune . for the subaru observations the suprime - cam with ten @xmath6 pixel ccds arranged in a @xmath7 pattern was used .",
    "suprime - cam has @xmath8 pixels that gives a pixel scale of @xmath9 pixel@xmath10 at prime focus and a field - of - view that is about @xmath11 with the north - south direction aligned with the long axis .",
    "gaps between the chips are about @xmath12 in the north - south direction and @xmath13 in the east - west direction ( miyazaki et al .",
    "2002 ) . at magellan the the imacs camera on the baade telescope was used .",
    "imacs is a wide - field ccd imager that has eight @xmath14 pixel ccds with a pixel scale of @xmath9 pixel@xmath10 and a field - of - view of about 0.2 square degrees .",
    "the eight ccds are arranged in a @xmath15 box pattern with four above and four below and about 12 arcsecond gaps between chips .",
    "the images were bias - subtracted and then flat - fielded with twilight flats . during exposures the telescope was autoguided sidereally on field stars .",
    "integration times were between 300 and 450 seconds and images of the same field were obtained on three visits with 1 to 1.5 hours between visits .",
    "observations were obtained while the neptune trojans were within 1 hour of opposition so the dominant apparent motion was largely parallactic and thus is inversely related to distance .",
    "objects at the heliocentric distance of neptune ,",
    "@xmath16 au , will have an apparent motion of about @xmath17  hr@xmath10 .",
    "previous surveys for neptune trojans focused mostly on finding relatively bright objects ( radii greater than 40 km or brighter than 24th magnitude ) ( chiang et al . 2003",
    "; sheppard & trujillo 2006 ; becker et al .",
    "the neptune trojan regions cover thousands of square degrees on the sky as many trojans have large inclinations and librate up to @xmath18 degrees from the lagrangian points over a ten thousand year time scale ( chiang et al .",
    "we obtained an ultra - deep , large area survey of the neptune l5 and l4 trojan regions .",
    "a total of 49 square degrees were searched of which 30 square degrees were in the l4 region while the other 19 square degrees were in the l5 region of neptune .",
    "subaru was used to covered 21 square degrees while magellan was used for the other 28 square degrees of the survey .",
    "the first high inclination neptune trojan , 2005 tn@xmath19 , was discovered at magellan ( sheppard & trujillo 2006 ) while the first l5 neptune trojan ( 2008 lc@xmath20 : sheppard & trujillo 2010 ) was found at subaru . in all",
    ", five l4 neptune trojans were detected at magellan ranging from 22.5 to 23.7 magnitudes ( about 70 to 40 km in radius ) while one l5 neptune trojan was detected at subaru with an magnitude of 23.2 in the r - band .",
    "the data were analyzed with a computer algorithm tuned to detect objects which appeared in all three images from one night with an apparent motion consistent with being beyond the orbit of jupiter ( speeds less than 20 arcseconds per hour ) .",
    "objects were flagged as possible neptune trojans if they moved between 3.5 and 4.5 arcseconds per hour .",
    "these objects were recovered up to two months later to determine if they had neptune trojan like orbits .",
    "the survey was designed similar to our ultra - deep surveys for satellites around the planets ( sheppard et al . 2005 ; sheppard & trujillo 2009 ) .",
    "we determined the limiting magnitude of the survey by placing artificial objects in the fields matched to the point spread function of the images and with motions of 4 arcseconds per hour .",
    "the brightnesses of the objects were binned by 0.1 mag and spanned the range from 25 to 27 magnitudes .",
    "results are shown in figure  [ fig : efftrojans ] . the @xmath0 detection efficiency for most of the fields is taken as our limiting magnitude , found to be @xmath1 .",
    "radii ( @xmath21 ) of the neptune trojans were determined assuming an albedo of @xmath22 and using the equation , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the heliocentric distance in au , @xmath25 is the geocentric distance in au , @xmath26 is the apparent red magnitude of the sun ( @xmath27 ) , @xmath28 is the red geometric albedo , @xmath29 is the apparent red magnitude of the trojan and @xmath30 is the phase function at opposition . using an albedo of 0.05 ( fernandez et al .",
    "2003 ; fernandez et al .",
    "2009 ) we find that 25.7 magnitudes corresponds to a neptune trojan with a radius of about 16 km .",
    "the cumulative luminosity function ( clf ) describes the sky - plane number density of objects brighter than a given magnitude .",
    "the clf can be described by @xmath31=\\alpha ( m_{r}-m_{o } )   \\label{eq : slope}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the number of objects brighter than @xmath29 , @xmath33 is the magnitude zero point , and @xmath34 describes the slope of the luminosity function .",
    "the clf found for neptune trojans is shown in figure  [ fig : cumtrojans ] .",
    "the clf of the brightest neptune trojans ( @xmath35 magnitude ) follows a steep power law of @xmath36 similar to the brightest kuiper belt objects , jupiter trojans and main belt asteroids ( jewitt et al . 2000 ; jedicke et al .",
    "2002 ; bottke et al . 2005 ; fraser & kavelaars 2008 ; fuentes & holman 2008 ) .",
    "the neptune trojans discovered in our survey are all bright ( @xmath37 magnitudes ) compared to the limiting magnitude of many of the survey fields ( @xmath1 magnitudes ) .",
    "a roll - over in the neptune trojan clf is apparent around @xmath5 . for",
    "the neptune trojans the best fit to the clf for @xmath38 mag is @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the points in a clf are heavily correlated with one another , tending to give excess weight to the faint end of the distribution .",
    "the differential luminosity function ( dlf ) does not suffer from this problem .",
    "we plot the dlf using a bin size of 0.5 mag for all neptune trojans detected in our survey ( figure  [ fig : difftrojans ] ) .",
    "the roll - over in the number of fainter objects is shown more dramatically through the dlf , and is insensitive to bin size choice .",
    "if the fainter ( smaller ) objects continued to follow the @xmath41 size distribution slope of the brighter ( larger ) objects we would have expected to discover @xmath42 neptune trojans between the roll - over point at @xmath43 magnitudes ( @xmath44 km ) and our survey limit of @xmath45 magnitudes ( @xmath46 km ) .",
    "though we found hundreds of kuiper belt objects with @xmath47 magnitudes we found zero neptune trojans of this faintness , which gives about an @xmath48 result that the smaller neptune trojans have a shallower power - law slope than the larger neptune trojans .",
    "thus like the other known stable small body reservoirs , the clf of the neptune trojans is best fit by a broken power law that breaks from a steep slope for the largest objects to a shallow distribution for the smaller objects .",
    "the data at the faintest end for the neptune trojans are within about @xmath49 of the shallow slope found for faint kbos ( figure  [ fig : cumtrojans ] ) .",
    "further data are required to determine a reliable slope for the neptune trojans at the faint end of the clf .",
    "though we can not completely rule out the possibility that the neptune trojans have a single very shallow power law it seems unlikely since we can not fit a single power law to all the points to within @xmath50 and the best fit power law to all the data would be the shallowest observed ( @xmath51 ) for such relatively large objects in the solar system",
    ". this slope would also be much shallower than the dohnanyi slope of 3.5 that is expected if the objects were in a state of collisional equilibrium ( obrien & greenberg 2003 ) .",
    "one of the main ways to constrain the formation and collisional history of an ensemble of objects such as the neptune trojans is to determine their size distribution .",
    "the size distribution is an indicator of how the accretion process worked and is related to the clf .",
    "if we assume the neptune trojans all have similar albedos to the jupiter trojans ( 0.05 , fernandez et al .",
    "2003 ) and are at a distance of 30 au we can determine the size distribution ( figure  [ fig : sizetrojans ] ) of the neptune trojans from the clf .",
    "a slope of @xmath52 is found for the large neptune trojan size distribution , where @xmath53 is the differential power - law radius distribution with @xmath54 the number of neptune trojans with radii in the range @xmath21 to @xmath55 .",
    "the roll - over in the size distribution for the neptune trojans occurs around a radius of @xmath56 km . when compared to the kuiper belt ( bernstein et al .",
    "2004 ; fraser & kavelaars 2008 ; fuentes & holman 2008 ; schlichting et al .",
    "2009 ) and jupiter trojan ( jewitt et al .",
    "2000 ; yoshida & nakamura 2005 ; yoshida & nakamura 2008 ) size distributions it appears that all three outer solar system small body populations have a similar roll - over in their size distribution ( radii of @xmath57 , @xmath58 km respectively for the jupiter trojans and kuiper belt ) .",
    "previous authors have shown that the kuiper belt s low inclination and high inclination classical populations may have different initial size distributions ( bernstein et al .",
    "2004 ; fuentes & kavelaars 2008 ; morbidelli et al .",
    "the neptune trojans have a steep size distribution at the large end , similar to that found for the low inclination kuiper belt objects and jupiter trojans , which may hint at a common origin ( morbidelli et al .",
    "further , the main belt of asteroids ( jedicke et al . 2002 ; bottke et al .",
    "2005 ) has a similar roll - over as the above reservoirs around a radius of @xmath59 km .",
    "there are unexpectedly far fewer tens of kilometer sized objects than larger objects in all the known stable reservoirs of small bodies in our solar system .",
    "the missing intermediate sized planetesimals ( misps ) are either an indication that the intermediate sized objects have been collisionally eroded over the age of the solar system or a primordial distribution deficient in intermediate sized objects was in place before capture .",
    "misps are not expected from a uniformly accreted population ( bottke et al .",
    "2005 ; kenyon et al . 2008 ) .",
    "detailed numerical collisional simulations ( morbidelli et al . 2009 ) have shown that collisional grinding is not the likely cause of the roll - over around a radius of 50 km in the size distribution of the main belt asteroids .",
    "this suggests the roll - over is a consequence of the original primordial formation mechanism of planetesimals .",
    "further , considering that each of the different small body reservoirs have significantly different compositions and collisional histories , the similarities of all the misps sizes throughout the various reservoirs suggests the lack of intermediate sized objects is likely a primordial result from before the planets formed .",
    "this has far - reaching implications for planetesimal formation and is very important for understanding planet formation in general .",
    "it is currently not understood how objects larger than about a meter in size formed in the solar nebula since meter - sized objects are likely to be disrupted from collisional erosion and have very short dynamical lifetimes due to gas drag and thus should not be able to grow to larger sizes ( wurm et al .",
    "2005 ; cuzzi & weidenschilling 2006 ; dominik et al .",
    "2007 ; blum et al . 2008 ) .",
    "several recent papers have suggested that the planetesimal formation mechanism jumps over this meter size barrier and instead large objects of hundreds of kilometers in size coalesce directly from over - dense clouds of cm to meter sized particles in a highly turbulent primordial solar nebula ( johansen et al .",
    "2007 ; cuzzi et al . 2008",
    "; morbidelli et al .",
    "2009 ; johansen et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "numerical collisional simulations as performed for the main asteroid belt ( morbidelli et al .",
    "2009 ) and their effect on the size distribution for the outer solar system small body reservoirs are warranted to constrain the role collisions play in helping produce the observed size distributions in these locations .",
    "it is likely that the trojans and kuiper belt objects have undergone less collisional evolution than the main belt asteroids since emplaced in their current orbits ( kenyon et al .",
    "2008 ; morbidelli et al .",
    "2009 ; levison et al . 2009 ) and if confirmed would indicate the observed roll - over in their size distribution is likely from primordial formation of the planetesimals .",
    "in addition , the outer solar system objects are likely to have some material strength ( levison et al . 2009 ; leinhardt & stewart 2009 ) , which appears to be an impediment for collisional erosion to account for the observed roll - over in the kuiper belt size distribution ( pan and sari 2005 ) . to date",
    "the size distributions of these more distant outer solar system reservoirs are much more poorly characterized by observations as the main asteroid belt .",
    "detailed in this work is the first measurement of the size distribution for the neptune trojans .",
    "the observations in this work , when compared with limited collisional simulations ( morbidelli et al .",
    "2009 ) , show that the lack of objects tens of kilometers in size for all known reservoirs agrees with planetesimal formation skipping over forming significant numbers of objects in the tens of kilometer size range for all areas of the solar system . in this scenario",
    ", objects smaller than about @xmath60 km are most likely collisional by - products of larger primordial objects ( farinella & davis 1996 ; kenyon & bromley 2004 ; kenyon et al . 2008 ) .",
    "it is possible that future collisional simulations using size - dependent drift due to the drag of a low turbulent solar nebular gas during accretion could account for the observed roll - over ( weidenschilling 2010 ) in the size distributions , but this scenario would likely be much more dependent on formation location in the solar nebula unlike the primordial coalescence of large objects from over - dense dust clouds .      comparing",
    "the various observed small body reservoirs shows that the kuiper belt holds most of the objects larger than 50 km in radius , about @xmath61 .",
    "the neptune trojans are the next most populated reservoir with about 400 objects larger than 50 km in radius expected ( a factor of about 375 less than the kuiper belt ) .",
    "the main belt asteroids contain about 200 objects larger than 50 km in radius or a factor of 2 less than the neptune trojans .",
    "the jupiter trojans have about 50 objects this size or a factor of 8 less than the neptune trojans .",
