    "while only one characteristic time can be enough to simulate the dynamics of an inertial point - like particle immersed in a known flow ( in the framework of @xcite ) , modeling material particles is often more demanding .",

    "this property , valid whatever the particle size and density ratio , implies that fluctuations experienced by particles can be considered to be uncorrelated with their dynamics due to the mean flow even if particles do not sample the flow homogeneously .",

    "figure [ tv ] shows the transverse velocity time scale increases by @xmath75 when increasing the particle size from @xmath34 to @xmath76 , which is consistent with other results obtained using a corrected faxen model to simulate the dynamics of isodense particles with sizes larger than the kolmogorov scale @xcite . as a result of the velocity correlation s anisotropy , we find @xmath77 is strongly anisotropic , being smaller for the axial component as compared to the transverse one .",
    "furthermore , no substantial variation of @xmath77 with @xmath78 is detected for the axial velocity because the shape of @xmath64 strongly changes at increasing particle size ( which biases the measure of @xmath79 ) .",

    "figure [ highspec](a ) presents the acceleration autocorrelation functions of polyamide particles for the four diameters investigated .",
    "one can clearly observe that particle acceleration decorrelates in a similar manner albeit at larger and larger time scales as the particle size increases . indeed , normalizing the time lag axis @xmath41 by the acceleration correlation time @xmath90 ( defined as the integral of the positive part of @xmath97 as introduced for small particles @xcite ) , we find that all functions almost collapse on a master curve ( figure [ highspec](b ) ) , even when looking at the axial component .",
    "figure [ highspec](c ) shows @xmath90 increases at increasing particle size in a more pronounced fashion than @xmath79 ( @xmath90 is approximately multiplied by 2.5 when @xmath78 increases fourfold ) .",
    "this increase of acceleration correlation time is not incompatible with the one found for much smaller material particles @xcite ( where @xmath98 increases by 2.8 when @xmath99 increases from 10 to 40 ) .",
    "contrary to observations made for the velocity , transverse accelerations have time scales barely larger than axial ones due to the fact that acceleration is more isotropic , as was observed for fluid particles @xcite .",
    "this quasi - isotropy stands whatever the particle size or density , and , as it is the case for previous results , the reynolds number dependence is fully captured by normalizing quantities with the rotation frequency @xmath22 ( as seen on figure [ highspec](d ) ) .    varying the density in the range @xmath100 $ ]",

    "a closer analysis of the density ratio effect on particle dynamics can be made by use of the raw acceleration power spectra . even if they are directly linked to correlation functions ( by a fourier transform ) , we find them more appropriate to compare light particles dynamics to the one of heavier particles through all time scales .",
    "figure [ highspec2](a ) shows indeed that whatever the particle size , acceleration power spectra are more energetic for a given light particle than for its heavy counterpart . of course",
    "this yields higher / lower rms acceleration values for light / heavy particles ( by a factor @xmath101 as shown in @xcite ) , which correspond to the integral of the power spectra .",
    "whatever the density , spectra exhibit a sharp cutoff in the range @xmath102 with a cutoff frequency , @xmath103 , which decreases at increasing particle size ( linked to the increase of @xmath90 with @xmath78 )",
    ". when a power law is tested , one finds @xmath104 with an exponent @xmath105 . the present decrease is faster than that observed for ocean floaters @xcite , or as predicted by sawford s two - times model for which acceleration spectra decrease as @xmath106 beyond the cutoff frequency @xcite .",
    "accordingly , spectra do not exhibit any plateau compatible with a kolmogorov scaling as observed for small particles , likely due to a lack of scale separation between the velocity integral time @xmath79 and the acceleration time scale @xmath90 .",
    "note that the increase in the raw acceleration power spectra for high frequencies corresponds to noise coming from position measurement .",

    "finding acceleration less sensitive to trapping effects or to the mean flow geometry can be expected as it is a small - scale quantity . however , with the small scale separation @xmath107 found for these large particles , it is surprising that theses results still stand ( which is confirmed by the fact that no decomposition is indeed needed to study particle acceleration ) .",
    "few lagrangian studies have measured both the velocity and acceleration time scales of fluid particles in turbulent flows and we will focus our comparison with the work of @xcite which took place in a similar setup . note that the particles considered in @xcite are slightly larger than the kolmogorov length scale .",
    "the velocity autocorrelation functions of such tracers have an exponential shape , with the lagrangian time @xmath108 as characteristic time scale , yielding @xmath109 .",
    "the authors indicated that the acceleration correlation functions cross zero at a value approximately 4 times larger than the value @xmath110 commonly reported @xcite ( an effect of the particles finite size ) . using a better estimate of the zero crossing time as @xmath111 , and assuming the positive part of the acceleration function is triangular , we then have @xmath112 .",
    "in the range of taylor micro scale reynolds number @xmath113 explored , we can then estimate from their data @xmath114 , increasing linearly with @xmath115 @xcite , which is consistent with the fact that the inertial range ( hence the scale separation ) grows at increasing reynolds number . in the case of the large particles considered in the present study , we find ratios between 1.5 and 4 depending on the particle size and acceleration component ( figure [ highspec2](b ) ) .",
    "this is indeed a much smaller scale separation for such particles , which is enlightening for modeling their dynamics , using for instance a two - time model ( @xcite for instance ) .",
    "we note that , as both @xmath79 and @xmath90 scale with @xmath22 in the same way , there is no reynolds number dependence of the scale separation for large particles , in opposition to the case of fluid particles .",
    "this is in agreement with the fact that the acceleration magnitude of large particles does not follow the classical @xmath116 ( see for instance @xcite ) but was found to scale with the forcing time scale @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "@xmath118 stands then as the good parameter , as the integral length scale is approximately constant with the reynolds number , while the kolmogorov length scale decreases with @xmath80 . indeed ,",
    "plotting @xmath119 ( or just @xmath120 ) as function of @xmath99 would yield different sets of curves , while one master curve emerges when plotted against @xmath118 .",
    "the particle density ratio , found to increase both velocity and acceleration time scales by approximately the same factor , play indeed no role on the @xmath107 ratio ( figure [ highspec2](b ) ) .",
    "the observed decrease of this ratio confirms that velocity time scales increase slower than that of acceleration , which is highlighted by the axial component where velocity time scales tend towards a constant value .",
    "the anisotropy of the scale separation is therefore attributed to velocity anisotropy , which is inherent to von  krmn  flows .",
    "we believe that , as the impact of the mean flow is totally removed for the transverse components , its evolution is more representative",
    ". it would be interesting to compare this decrease of the scale separation to particles of size in or below the inertial range .",
    "to our knowledge , previous studies of smaller material particles ( typically in the range @xmath121 @xcite ) , only report measurements of acceleration time scales , as the velocity time scale demands much longer trajectories .",
    "using 3d particle tracking , we have studied the characteristic time scales of very large inertial particles in a non homogeneous fully turbulent flow .",
    "lagrangian tools have shown the strong influence of particle size on their dynamics . indeed , for these large objects , we found both acceleration and velocity time scales to be strongly increasing with the particle size .",
    "this is the signature of a modification of the particle dynamics over the whole range of frequencies , as shown by the lagrangian power spectra of the particle acceleration .",
    "frequencies higher than the injection frequency displayed strong cutoffs in acceleration spectra due to particle size , corresponding to the observed increase of acceleration time scales @xmath90 with the particle size .",
    "although this is in agreement with previous measurements of finite size particle acceleration @xcite , acceleration spectra were found to decrease much faster than @xmath106 as reported for ocean floats with much smaller @xmath99 ratios @xcite . +",
    "in order to separate the effects of size and density , we varied the particle relative density and compared systematically the results obtained for particles @xmath82 lighter than the fluid to the one of particles @xmath122 heavier . for all quantities , the role of density was found much less influential than particle size .",
    "this is a specificity of particles much larger than the kolmogorov length scale , for which density appears only to finely tune the dynamics , whose main features ( trapping and response to turbulent fluctuations ) are imposed by the particle size . as a result , the observed variation in the statistics can be qualitatively explained through the action of the added mass force .",
    "+ our study has investigated the dynamics of particles over the whole volume of a confined flow and tracked them for durations larger than the large eddy turnover time .",
    "as a consequence , velocity correlations were biased by contributions from the mean flow so that the lagrangian integral time was zero . by removing the local value of the mean flow along each trajectory to estimate fluctuating velocity correlations",
    ", we were able to quantify the effects of size and density on the lagrangian integral time .",
    "as particles above a certain size develop coming and going motions in the axial direction in such flows @xcite , the autocorrelation functions of the axial velocity are more heavily biased .",
    "indeed , the shape of the autocorrelation function of the fluctuating velocity remained strongly influenced by the particle size such that the lagrangian integral time remained the same up to measurement errors ( in the axial direction only ) .",
