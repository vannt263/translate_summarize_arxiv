    "the firs release of _ planck _ data improves the quality of cosmological data extraordinary @xcite .",
    "it allows us to give a tighter constraint to the cosmological parameter space . and the cold dark matter plus a cosmological constant @xmath4 ,",
    "the so - called @xmath4cdm model , can almost agree with the most recent cosmic observations which include the type - ia supernovae ( sn ) , the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) and the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) successfully at large scales .",
    "however , it has several potential problems on smaller scales @xcite . how to explain the discrepancies on large and small scales is currently still under debate @xcite",
    ". the warm dark matter has been proclaimed as a potential solution to the small scale difficulties of cold dark matter @xcite .",
    "it leaves some space to an alternative to the cold dark matter model .",
    "the focus point is whether it is cold or warm .",
    "actually , the hot dark matter was ruled out due to the difficulty in forming the observed large scale structure . to characterize the properties of warm dark matter",
    ", the equation of state @xmath0 is an important indicator in a fluid perspective . and the value of @xmath7 should be determined by the cosmic observations .",
    "a significant nonzero value of @xmath0 indicates the dark matter is warm rather than cold . in the literature ,",
    "the equation of state of wdm was constrained by many groups under the assumption of a constant @xmath0 , a time variable @xmath0 with a cosmological constant or @xmath8 dark energy . for an example , please see @xcite and references therein . see also ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the difficulties of the small scale behavior of warm dark matter were pointed out .",
    "if the dark matter is really warm the model parameters would be different even it were to have the same background evolution history as that of the @xmath4cdm model .",
    "a different large scale structure would form due to the different perturbation evolutions . therefore",
    ", the large scale structure information will be important to break degeneracies between model parameters and to determine the properties of dark matter which is the main part of the large scale structure of our universe .",
    "we would also like to mention the particle side of dark matter ; please see ref .",
    "@xcite for brief reviews .",
    "thanks to the measurements of wigglez dark energy survey , a total @xmath9 galaxies in the redshift range @xmath10 were measured .",
    "these galaxies were split into four redshift bins with ranges @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the corresponding power spectrum in the four redshift bins was measured ; for details , please see @xcite .",
    "we estimate the nonlinear growth from a given linear growth theory power spectrum based on the principles of the halo model ; actually the halofit formula will be used in this paper @xcite . at the scale of halo , the growth of halos depends on the local physics , and not on the details of precollapse matter and the large scale distribution of matter .",
    "thus , in the nonlinear regime the growth depends only on the nonlinear scale , the slope and curvature of the power spectrum @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we loosen the constraint to a zero equation of state and investigate the simplest model for dark matter , i.e. the one with a constant @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the main information is stored in the matter power spectrum .",
    "also we assume the halofit formula is still suitable for this case , though the formula would be modified due to the free - streaming of warm dark matter @xcite . by a combination of cmb , sdss bao , sn and wigglez , the eos of dark matter will be tested . as results ,",
    "we did not find significant deviation from @xmath15 in @xmath6 regions .",
    "actually , this simplest form dark matter was already constrained by using @xmath16 sn , cmb shift parameter @xmath17 and bao distance parameter @xmath18 @xcite ( see also in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , in which a time variable equation os state of dark matter was also considered .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite discussed the degeneracies between model parameters extensively and found the equation os state of dark matter in the range of @xmath19 regions @xmath20 by using the data combination of wmap5+sdss+snls .",
    "it implies the cold dark matter @xmath15 is compatible in the @xmath6 region . as a revisit to the work of ref .",
    "@xcite and a comparison to the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , here we will use the full information of cmb , which includes the recently released _",
    "planck _ data sets , which include the high - l tt likelihood ( _ camspec _ ) up to a maximum multipole number of @xmath21 from @xmath22 ; the low - l tt likelihood ( _ lowl _ ) up to @xmath23 ; and the low - l te , ee , bb likelihoods up to @xmath24 from wmap9 ; the data sets are available on line @xcite . for the sn data points as `` standard candles '' , the luminosity distances will be employed . in this paper",
    ", we keep to use the snls3 which consists of @xmath25 sn calibrated by sifto and salt2 ; for details , please see ref .",
    "although the photometric calibration of the snls and the sdss supernova surveys were improved @xcite , they are still unavailable publicly . for the bao data points as `` standard ruler '' , we use the measured ratio of @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the comoving sound horizon scale at the recombination epoch , and @xmath28 is the `` volume distance '' which is defined as @xmath29^{1/3},\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the angular diameter distance . here the bao measurements from wigglez are not included , as they come from the same galaxy sample as the @xmath31 measurement . because the full information of cmb and wigglez power spectrum is employed , a tiger constraint is expected .",
    "our results will show that it is indeed the case .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : bpes ] , we present the main background evolution and perturbation equations for dark matter with an arbitrary equation os state . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , the constrained results are presented via the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method .",
    "section [ sec : con ] is the conclusion .",
    "the equation os state of dark matter is given as @xmath32 the friedmann equation for a spatially flat frw universe reads @xmath33,\\label{eq : ehfe}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 are the present dimensionless energy densities for the radiation , the baryon , the dark matter and the cosmological constant respectively , where @xmath35 is respected for a spatially flat universe .",
    "in this paper , the dark matter is taken as a perfect fluid with a constant equation os state , and then in the synchronous gauge the perturbation equations of density contrast and velocity divergence for the dark matter are written as @xmath36 following the notations of ma and bertschinger @xcite , in which the definition of the adiabatic sound speed @xmath37 is used . here",
    "the equations are also ready for a general form of dark matter .",
    "when the equation os state of a pure barotropic fluid is negative , the imaginary adiabatic sound speed can cause instability of the perturbations . to overcome this problem , one can introduce an entropy perturbation and assume a positive or null effective speed of sound . following the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , the nonadiabatic stress or entropy perturbation can be separated out @xmath38 which is gauge independent . in the rest frame of dark matter",
    ", the entropy perturbation is specified as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the effective speed of sound .",
    "transforming into an arbitrary gauge @xmath41 gives a gauge - invariant form for the entropy perturbations . by using eqs ( [ eq : entropyper ] , ) ( [ eq : restframe ] ) and ( [ eq : gaugetrans ] ) , one can recast eqs .",

    ", we should take it as another free model parameter .",
    "the sound speed determines the sound horizon of the fluid via the equation @xmath44 .",
    "the fluid can be smooth or cluster below or above the sound horizon @xmath45 respectively .",
    "if the sound speed is smaller , the perturbation of the fluid can be detectable on large scale . in turn",
    "the clustering fluid can influence the growth of density perturbations of matter , large scale structure and evolving gravitational potential which generates the integrated sachs - wolfe effects .",
    "the dark matter is responsible to formation of the large scale structure of our universe , so we assume the effective speed of sound @xmath46 in this work .",
    "to obtain the equation os state of dark matter from the currently available cosmic observations , we use the mcmc method which is efficient in the case of more parameters .",
    "we modified the publicly available * cosmomc * package @xcite to include the perturbation evolutions of dark matter with a general form of equation os state according to the eqs .",

    "the pivot scale of the initial scalar power spectrum @xmath50 is used in this paper .    after running eight chains for every cosmological model with different values of @xmath0 on the _ computing cluster for cosmos _ , we show the obtained results in table [ tab : results ] .",

    "this implies that the determination of @xmath53 is vital to pin down the equation os state of dark matter .",
    "the inclusion of wigglez measurements of power spectrum decreases the values of @xmath0 and @xmath54 and shrinks the bounds mildly . for comparison , by using the same data sets combination , the model parameters of the @xmath4cdm model",
