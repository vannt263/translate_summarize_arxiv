    "quantum teleportation  @xcite is considered to be a perfect way of transferring qubits over long distances .",
    "it is particularly important to teleport qubits represented by the atomic states , which can store quantum information for sufficiently long time as to make it available for further quantum processing .",
    "however , in contrast to the teleportation of photonic states , the teleportation of atomic states over long distances is a difficult task . as yet , the longest distance achieved experimentally for atomic states is of the order of micrometers  @xcite while for photonic states is of the order of kilometers  @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that the distance of atomic states teleportation has to be orders of magnitude greater to make the teleportation useful in quantum communication . in order to make this distance greater ,",
    "it is necessary to employ photons , which are the best long distance carriers of quantum information , to establish quantum communication between the remote atoms and complete the atomic state teleportation .",
    "such a scheme of atomic state teleportation has been presented by bose  _ et al . _",
    "they have proposed an additional stage of teleportation protocol  the preparation stage , in which the state of sender atom is mapped onto the sender cavity field state and therefore can be teleported in the next stage using well known linear optics techniques .",
    "the possibility of operating on atomic qubits with linear optics elements is the reason why a combination of atomic states and cavity field states has been recently suggested in many proposals , not only in proposals of teleportation protocols  @xcite but also in other schemes of quantum information processing  .",
    "unfortunately , the state mapping and whole preparation stage is not perfect because of a destructive role played by cavity decay .",
    "the cavity decay reduces the fidelity of teleported state and the probability of success .",
    "bose  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have suggested a way to minimize a destructive role of this imperfection by assuming very small cavity decay rate .",
    "however , the value of cavity decay rate required by their protocol is two orders of magnitude below of what is currently available  @xcite .    here , we present a protocol that reduces the effect of cavity decay on the fidelity .",
    "this protocol makes it possible to use cavities with larger decay rates without worsening the fidelity but at the expense of lowering success rates .",
    "the teleportation protocol that we propose in this paper is designed for the same device which bose _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite consider in their scheme .",
    "the device is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : device ] .",
    "it is        composed of two cavities @xmath1 and @xmath2 , a 50 - 50 beam splitter , two lasers @xmath3 and @xmath4 and two single - photon detectors @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the receiver , bob , has the cavity @xmath2 and the laser @xmath4 .",
    "the other elements of the device are at the side of the sender  alice . inside each cavity",
    "there is one trapped atom , modeled by a three - level @xmath7 system with two stable ground states @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and one excited state @xmath10 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda ] .",
    "atom interacting with the classical laser field and the quantized cavity mode.,width=264 ]    only the excited state decays spontaneously , therefore the ground states are ideal candidates for an atomic qubit .",
    "the spontaneous decay rate of the excited state is denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "operations on the qubit coded in the superposition of both ground states are possible using two transitions : @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "first of the transitions is coupled to the cavity mode with the coupling strength @xmath14 while the second transition is coupled to a classical laser field with the coupling strength @xmath15 . since we want a population of the excited state to be negligible , the laser field and the cavity mode are detuned from the corresponding transition frequencies by @xmath16 . beside the spontaneous decay of the excited atomic state",
    "there is another decay mechanism .",
    "one mirror in each cavity is partially transparent and therefore photons leak out of the cavities through these mirrors at a rate @xmath17 .",
    "the evolution of each atom - cavity system is governed by the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian ( @xmath18 here and in the following ) @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the annihilation operator for alice s cavity mode ( @xmath21 ) or bob s cavity mode ( @xmath22 ) . in  ( [ eq : hamiltonian0 ] )",
    "we introduce the flip operators @xmath23 .",
    "both our protocol as well as the bose  _ et al .",
    "_ protocol work in the low saturation limit ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) and therefore the excited atomic state can be adiabatically eliminated  @xcite .",
    "either of them require small values of the spontaneous decay rate ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 )  @xcite which makes it possible to neglect @xmath11 as a first approximation .",
    "finally , we assume the condition @xmath29 which leads to a very simple form of the hamiltonian @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "the evolution described by  ( [ eq : hamil1 ] ) is interrupted by collapses .",
    "photon decays registered by detectors correspond to the action of the collapse operator @xmath32 where @xmath33 is equal to @xmath34 for photon detection in @xmath5 and equal to @xmath35 for photon detection in @xmath6 .",
    "the simple form of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamil1 ] ) allows for analytical solutions of the non - unitary schrdinger equation and get expressions for the time evolution of quantum states which are used in both protocols . to give the expressions a more compact form we use the notation @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the state @xmath39 experiences no dynamics because there is no operator in the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamil1 ] ) which can change this state .",
    "time evolution of the other two states is described by @xmath40 \\ , , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "|01\\rangle     \\big ] \\ , , \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 .",
    "there are two important local operations we can perform on the system state via @xmath42 .",
    "first of them is to map the atomic state onto the cavity mode and second is the generation of the maximally entangled state of the atom and the cavity mode .",
    "the atomic state mapping one can obtain by turning the laser on for time @xmath43 is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 $ ] . in order to create the maximally entangled state",
    "the laser should be turned on for time @xmath46 @xmath47    when the laser is turned off then @xmath48 , and the hamiltonian goes over into @xmath49",
    ". then all the terms of the hamiltonian correspond to the diagonal elements in matrix representation , and the non - unitary schrdinger equation can be easily solved .",
    "the evolution of the states @xmath37 and @xmath38 , when the laser is turned off , are thus given by @xmath50",
    "both protocols start with the same initial state  the unknown state that alice wants to teleport , which is stored in her atom .",
    "bob s atom is prepared in the state @xmath9 and the field modes of both cavities are empty , so we have @xmath51 the teleportation protocol with improved fidelity consists of five stages : ( a ) the preparation stage , ( b ) the detection stage i , ( c ) the compensation stage , ( d ) the detection stage ii and ( e ) the recovery stage .",
    "the preparation stage is necessary because the quantum information encoded initially in alice s atom is teleported by performing joint measurement on the field state of both cavities . before of the detection stage alice",
    "has to map the quantum information onto her cavity field state while bob has to create the maximally entangled state of his atom and his cavity field .",
    "alice and bob achieve their goals by switching their lasers on for times @xmath43 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "after the preparation stage the state of alice s atom - cavity system is given by @xmath53 and bob s system state becomes @xmath54 this first stage is successful only under the absence of photon detection event .",
    "the probability that no collapse occurs during alice s operation is given by the squared norm of the state vector @xmath55 similarly , we can obtain appropriate expression for the probability of no collapse during bob s operation @xmath56 it is evident that the state mapping is not perfect because of the damping factors that appear in expression  ( [ eq : pa ] ) for @xmath57 and in expression  ( [ eq : p3 ] ) for the state @xmath58 .",
    "these damping factors reduce both the probability that the state mapping is successful and the fidelity of this operation . the quantum information after the mapping operation is also modified by the phase factor @xmath59 but , in contrast to damping factors , the phase factors can later be easily compensated for and therefore they do not reduce the fidelity . in order to make the probability @xmath57 and the fidelity close to unity bose  _ et al .",
    "_ assume that @xmath60 , which means that both @xmath17 and @xmath43 values are small and the damping factor @xmath61 is close to unity .",
    "generally , however , the damping factor is not unity even for very small @xmath17 and @xmath43 and , in consequence , the fidelity of the teleported state is diminished . since",
    "high fidelities are required by quantum computation algorithms , we will show how to compensate for this factor in the next stages of the protocol .",
    "when the quantum information is mapped onto the state of alice s cavity field and the maximally entangled state of bob s cavity field and the target atom is created , then the joint measurement of both cavity fields can be performed . during this stage alice and",
    "bob perform the joint measurement just by waiting with their lasers turned off .",
    "the teleportation is successful if the detectors register one and only one photon . in successful cases",
    "the joint state of alice s and bob s systems becomes @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the time of this detection stage . until now",
    "the operations in both protocols are exactly the same . in the protocol of bose _",
    "_ it is assumed that time @xmath63 is much longer than @xmath64 and thus all unwanted states in expression  ( [ eq : tel16 ] ) can be neglected .",
    "finally , after removing a phase factor , the state of bob s atom is given by latexmath:[$\\alpha    that the fidelity of teleported state will never reach unity because of the factor @xmath61 .",
    "moreover , in the protocol of bose  _ et al . _",
    "the fidelity of teleported state decreases with increasing @xmath17 . in our protocol",
    ", we use one of the unwanted states to compensate for the factor @xmath61 .",
    "this compensation can be done if we choose the time of this detection stage such that @xmath66",
    ". then expression  ( [ eq : tel16 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath67      in the compensation stage bob compensates for the factor @xmath61 by turning his laser on for time @xmath68 . during the operation alice s laser",
    "remains turned off . on condition",
    "that no photon detection occurs during time @xmath68 , the unnormalized joint state at the end of this stage is given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 it is seen that this operation transfers population from the state @xmath71 , which is unwanted , to the state @xmath72 .",
    "of course , we want the transfer to compensate for the factor @xmath61 and therefore @xmath68 has to fulfill the condition @xmath73      the population of one of the two unwanted states is already reduced after the previous stage , but it can not be neglected yet . moreover , the population of the second unwanted state is still considerable .",
    "presence of the two unwanted states decreases the teleportation fidelity , so in the fourth stage of the protocol alice and bob have to eliminate them .",
    "all they have to do to achieve this goal is simply to wait for a finite time @xmath74 .",
    "after time @xmath75 the populations of both unwanted states are negligible and unnormalized joint state can be very well approximated by @xmath76      finally , bob has to remove the phase shift factor @xmath77 to recover the original alice s state . to this end bob adds to the state @xmath78 an extra phase shift with respect to the state @xmath79 using the zeeman evolution  @xcite . after this operation",
    "the state of bob s atom is exactly the same as the initial state of alice s atom , i.e. , latexmath:[$\\alpha |0\\rangle_{\\textrm{atom } b}+\\beta    this protocol can be very close to unity .",
    "this completes the teleportation protocol .",
    "now it is time to explain in detail how to choose the time @xmath63 .",
    "the condition @xmath66 leads to many solutions given by @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is a nonnegative integer .",
    "however , we can not set @xmath82 arbitrary because @xmath83 and the probability of success in second stage are functions of @xmath63 .",
    "it is obvious that the probability of observing one photon during detection time @xmath63 increases with increasing @xmath63 . on the other hand",
    ", we can not choose this detection time too long because the population of unwanted state @xmath71 can then be too small to compensate for the factor @xmath61 .",
    "thus , @xmath63 is limited by some time @xmath84 .",
    "let us now estimate @xmath84 .",
    "expression @xmath85 takes its maximal value for the time of the compensation stage given by @xmath86 the factor @xmath61 can be compensated for only under the condition that @xmath87 . since both @xmath83 and @xmath88 depend on @xmath63 , we can estimate the value of @xmath84 by finding numerically @xmath63 satisfying the condition @xmath89    the problem of choosing @xmath63 is much simpler when we want to compensate for the factor @xmath61 for as large @xmath17 as possible .     as a function of @xmath17 for @xmath90 mhz calculated numerically using condition  ( [ eq : tdmax]).,width=264 ]    from figure  [ fig : tdodk ]",
    "one can see that the limit @xmath84 decreases with increasing @xmath17 . therefore we should choose the smallest value of @xmath63 by setting @xmath82 to zero .",
    "let us now compare both protocols . for this purpose we compute the average probability of success and the average fidelity of teleported state for the same values of the detuning and both coupling strengths as in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. , @xmath90 mhz .",
    "it is necessary to take average values over all input states because the probability of success in both protocols as well as the fidelity in the bose  _ et al .",
    "_ protocol all depend on the unknown moduli of the amplitudes @xmath91 and @xmath92 of the initial state .",
    "the fidelity in our protocol seems to be independent of the amplitudes of initial state and should be equal to unity .",
    "however , this is only true for the simplified model for which the excited state is eliminated . in more general model described by the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian0 ] ) the population of the excited state has a nonzero value during the evolution given by  ( [ eq : u ] ) even if the atom is initially prepared in its ground state .",
    "however , the population of the excited state remains zero for the initial state @xmath39 of atom - cavity system because the state experiences no dynamics .",
    "if the initial state is a superposition given by  ( [ eq : p0 ] ) then the population of the excited state depends on the moduli of the amplitudes @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "since the population of the excited state reduces the fidelity , it is also necessary to average the fidelity in our protocol over all input states .",
    "we compute all the averages numerically using the method of quantum trajectories  @xcite together with the monte carlo technique .",
    "each trajectory starts with a random initial state and evolves according to a chosen teleportation protocol .",
    "if measurement indicates success then we calculate the fidelity of teleported state at the end of the protocol .",
    "otherwise , we reject a trajectory as unsuccessful . after generating 20 000 trajectories we average the fidelity over all trajectories and calculate the average probability of success as a ratio of the number of successful trajectories to the number of all trajectories .",
    "there are some problems that appear when we use the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian0 ] ) to simulate performance of our protocol .",
    "first , the fidelity is sensitive to the inaccuracy in calculations of phase shift factors .",
    "the compensation of the factor @xmath61 requires the phase shift of the state @xmath71 relative to the state @xmath93 ) .",
    "therefore the time @xmath63 of the detection stage i has to satisfy the condition @xmath66 .",
    "however , the analytical expression for @xmath94 is derived from the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamil1 ] ) and thus @xmath95 is only an approximation to the real phase shift factor .",
    "unfortunately , the population transfer that takes place in the compensation stage leads to an unknown extra phase shift in the final state  ( [ eq : tel34 ] ) when the phase shift between states @xmath71 and @xmath72 differs from the expected value @xmath96 .",
    "of course , this unknown phase shift can not be compensated for in the recovery stage , which means that the fidelity in our protocol can even be smaller than the fidelity in the bose  _ et al .",
    "_ protocol .",
    "to overcome this problem we use a numerical optimization procedure which finds , for the more general model , such @xmath63 that the joint state of alice s and bob s systems becomes as close to the expected state given by  ( [ eq : tel32 ] ) as possible .",
    "second , a question arises : how to estimate the biggest value of @xmath17 for which the compensation is still possible ?",
    "this value is very important because we want to know how good ( or rather bad ) cavities can be used for effective high fidelity teleportation . in the simplified model of our protocol governed by the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamil1 ] )",
    "this value can be computed from  ( [ eq : tdmax ] ) and is about @xmath97 mhz .",
    "however , the population of the excited atomic state changes this value because of the transfer of population from the state @xmath98 to the state @xmath72 in the compensation stage . to estimate the acceptable value of @xmath17",
    ", we plot the average fidelity and the average probability of success as functions of @xmath17 .",
    "the population of the excited atomic state changes also the time @xmath68 for which the improvement of the fidelity in our protocol is the best one and thus the value of @xmath68 calculated from  ( [ eq : co ] ) can be used only as a starting point in the numerical computation of this time . from numerical results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fodk ] we find that there     mhz .",
    "the averages are taken over 20 000 trajectories.,width=264 ]    is a plateau in the fidelity of the modified protocol up to @xmath99 mhz after which the fidelity jumps down .",
    "we consider the value of @xmath17 at the jump as the biggest value of @xmath17 .",
    "third , the population of the excited atomic state oscillates .",
    "since the population of the excited state diminishes the fidelity of operations periodically , it is necessary to compute numerically , for all operations , such times that minimize the population simultaneously maximizing the fidelity .",
    "until now we have assumed that times @xmath43 and @xmath52 can be calculated analytically as in the bose  _ et al . _ protocol",
    "however , the analytical expressions are functions of @xmath17 , so , for different values of @xmath17 the population of the excited state and the fidelities of operations take different values .",
    "if we want to stabilize the average fidelity at a high level for different values of @xmath17 then we have to compute @xmath43 and @xmath52 numerically .",
    "to begin with our calculations , we set the spontaneous decay rate of excited state to zero because we want to know how close to unity is the fidelity in the ideal case in which there is no possibility of photon emission to modes other than the cavity modes .",
    "[ fig : fodk ] shows that the modified protocol really stabilizes the fidelity of teleported state at a high level .",
    "the fidelity is reduced only by the nonzero population of the excited state and does not decrease with increasing @xmath17 until @xmath100 is about @xmath101 mhz .",
    "the fidelity of teleported state in the protocol of bose  _ et al . _",
    "is reduced by the population of excited state as well as by the factor @xmath102 and , as expected , it decreases with increasing @xmath17 .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : fodk ] that there are discontinuous jumps of the fidelity values .",
    "the discontinuities come from the numerical procedure finding such @xmath43 for which the mapping fidelity is maximal .",
    "the time @xmath43 of the mapping operation is a function of @xmath17 , and the mapping fidelity reaches its maximal value when the population of the excited state reaches its minimal value . since the population of the excited state oscillates the numerically calculated @xmath43 jumps , as @xmath17 increases , from one value for which the population of the excited state is minimal after the mapping operation to the next such value",
    "thus , the factor @xmath102 and the fidelity of the teleported state also exhibit discontinuous behavior .",
    "mhz.,width=264 ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : podk ] shows that the probability of success in the protocol with improved fidelity is always less than the probability of success in the protocol of bose  _ et al .",
    "_ fortunately , there is only a small difference between the probabilities of both protocols for the biggest cavity decay rate for which compensation is still possible , i.e. , for @xmath99 mhz .",
    "so far we have assumed that there is no possibility of photon emission to modes other than the cavity mode .",
    "let us now relax this assumption and investigate the influence of the spontaneous emission decay rate of the excited state on both teleportation protocols .",
    "the spontaneous atomic emission destroys the quantum information which alice wants to teleport to bob .",
    "such runs of the teleportation protocols are unsuccessful and should be rejected .",
    "however , an event of spontaneous atomic emission can not be detected in both schemes and therefore the spontaneous decay rate of excited state reduces the average fidelities .",
    "we can only suppress this imperfection by taking @xmath27 , @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "the biggest @xmath17 for which the compensation is still possible allows for the choice of @xmath103  mhz .",
    "we have generated 20 000 trajectories to compute the average fidelities and the average probabilities for the parameters @xmath104 @xmath105 mhz . as a result",
    "we have obtained the average fidelity of @xmath106 and the average probability of @xmath107 for the bose  _ et al .",
    "_ protocol and the average fidelity of @xmath108 and the success rate of @xmath109 for the modified protocol .",
    "the results indicate that the inability to distinguish the runs of protocols , in which spontaneous emission occurs , reduces only slightly the average fidelities when @xmath103  mhz .",
    "the average probabilities of success remain unchanged .",
    "other two important imperfections , which we have to take into account , are a finite detection quantum efficiency and the presence of dark counts .",
    "it is necessary to include such sources of noise in our numerical calculations because they are introduced by all real detectors .",
    "so far we have assumed in our analysis perfect detectors that are able to register all collected photons and do not produce any signal in the absence of photons . in practice , this assumption is not valid .",
    "the probability that a single photon reaching the detector is converted into the measurable signal , which is called the quantum efficiency and denoted by @xmath110 , is less than unity for all real detectors  @xcite .",
    "moreover , there are clicks , for all real detectors , even in the absence of light .",
    "they are called dark counts .",
    "these imperfections lead to lowering the average fidelity in both teleportation protocols because of randomness which they introduce to the measurement outcome . there is no way to distinguish the unsuccessful case of two photon emissions from the desired case of one photon emission when only one of the two emitted photons is detected .",
    "it is also not possible to recognize the unsuccessful case of no emission if one dark count occurs during the detection stage .",
    "the quantum information that alice wants to teleport is destroyed in the unsuccessful cases .",
    "if one can not reject such cases then the average fidelity is reduced .",
    "therefore it is necessary to use detectors with very high efficiency @xmath110 and a low enough dark count rate . as far as we know ,",
    "the highest detector efficiency has been reported by takeuchi  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and is equal to @xmath111 . to study the effect of the detector inefficiency on the protocols under discussion , we have performed numerical calculations under the assumption that there are not dark counts first .",
    "we have used the same parameters as previously , i.e. , @xmath104 @xmath105 mhz and we have found that both protocols are sensitive to the detector inefficiency .",
    "the average fidelity is reduced to @xmath112 in the bose  _ et al .",
    "_ protocol and to @xmath113 in the modified protocol .",
    "success rates remain almost unchanged  @xmath114 in the bose  _ et al .",
    "_ protocol and @xmath115 in the modified protocol .",
    "it is obvious that the reliable teleportation requires detectors efficiency @xmath111 or higher .",
    "unfortunately , the dark count rate of the detector increases roughly exponentially with the efficiency  @xcite and is as high as @xmath116  khz at the highest efficiency reported by takeuchi  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , i.e. , @xmath111 .",
    "the high efficiency of the detector means also the high rate of dark counts , which are not good for teleportation .",
    "to clarify the situation , we have also investigated the influence of the dark count rate on both teleportation protocols .",
    "surprisingly , the protocol with improved fidelity has appeared to be less sensitive to this imperfection than the bose  _ et al .",
    "_ protocol . the average fidelity in the bose  _ et al .",
    "_ protocol appeared to be equal to @xmath117 while the average fidelity in the modified protocol to be equal to @xmath118 , for the parameters @xmath111 and the dark count rate @xmath116  khz .",
    "the difference between the two protocols is quite impressive , but it has a simple explanation . in either protocol there is only one stage when the detection of one photon is expected  the detection stage in the bose  _ et al . _",
    "protocol and the detection stage i in the modified protocol . only in these two stages occurrence of the dark count",
    "can be erroneously accepted as a successful measurement event because all other stages require no photon detection to be successful .",
    "thus , one can easily understand why the influence of the dark counts on both protocols is different by comparing the times of the two crucial stages  the time of the detection stage of the bose  _ et al .",
    "_ protocol ( in our calculations we set @xmath119 ) that is much longer than the time of the detection stage i ( @xmath120 ) of the modified protocol .",
    "this means that there are many more rejected dark counts in the modified protocol than in the bose  _ et al .",
    ". a bigger number of rejected runs with the dark count events leads to an increased average fidelity and at the same time to a decreased success rate .",
    "therefore , the success rate is reduced more significantly in the modified protocol ( @xmath121 ) than in the bose  _ et al .",
    "_ protocol ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "finally , we generalize our calculations to include losses in the mirrors and during the propagation .",
    "the absorption in the mirrors can be taken into account by making the replacement @xmath123 in the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian0 ] ) , where @xmath124 is the decay rate corresponding to the photon transmission through the mirror and @xmath125 is the photon loss rate due to absorption in the mirrors .",
    "the evolution of the system is conditional , so we need also the collapse operators corresponding to the absorption of photons in the mirrors .",
    "the additional collapse operators are given by @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "as before , the collapse operators describing photon detections are given by  ( [ eq : c ] ) but with @xmath17 replaced by @xmath124 .",
    "so , we now have two extra collapse operators describing evolution of the system . however , it can be checked that such evolution can be described without using the extra collapse operators when we make the replacement @xmath123 in the collapse operators given by equation  ( [ eq : c ] ) and multiply the probability of photon detection by @xmath128 , which is the probability that a photon is detected despite the fact that there is absorption in the mirrors .",
    "the probability of detection in the presence of absorption is then @xmath129 .",
    "the presence of absorption means effectively lower efficiency of the detector .    in the same way",
    ", we easily can take into account all photon losses during the propagation between the cavities and the detectors  @xcite .",
    "all we need to include such losses into consideration is to introduce additional efficiency factor @xmath130 .",
    "multiplying all the factors , we find the overall detection efficiency @xmath131 . to visualize the effect of such losses , we have plotted the average fidelity and the average probability for both protocols as functions of the overall detection inefficiency , i.e. , as functions of @xmath132 . in order to make the average values reliable ,",
