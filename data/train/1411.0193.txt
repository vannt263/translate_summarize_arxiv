    "if question [ is - einstein ] were answered in the affirmative , it could perhaps be possible to find einstein metrics on new manifolds by direct variational methods , by maximizing the functional @xmath41 .",
    "theorem [ conv - hull ] generalizes two previous results on question [ is - einstein ] . in the case",
    "when the finite set of theorem [ conv - hull ] consists simply of a single metric @xmath5 , the following well - known result is obtained :    [ unique ] suppose that the conformal class @xmath0 attains @xmath9 , and suppose that there is , up to rescaling , exactly one yamabe metric @xmath5 in @xmath0 . then @xmath5 is einstein .",

    "then in fact there is exactly one yamabe metric , and that metric is einstein .",
    "we note a different point of view , from which the available evidence regarding question [ is - einstein ] is more equivocal .",
    "there is a bidirectional version of lemma [ unique ] which rephrases question [ is - einstein ] as a question of uniqueness :    let @xmath2 be a compact manifold other than the sphere , and suppose the conformal class @xmath0 attains @xmath9 .",
    "then there is an einstein metric in @xmath0 if and only there is a unique ( modulo rescaling ) yamabe metric in @xmath0 ; the einstein metric is the yamabe metric if so .    in a general ( that is , not necessarily maximizing ) conformal class , the question of uniqueness ( modulo rescaling ) of yamabe metrics is well - studied . let @xmath46 be the subset of conformal classes containing a unique yamabe metric .",
    "@xmath46 is large ( for instance it contains all conformal classes @xmath0 such that @xmath47 @xcite , and it is open and dense @xcite ) but its complement need not actually be empty ; the simplest counterexample is the round sphere , and many others have been found @xcite .",
    "we therefore hope that future work may use the results of this paper to provide a resolution of question [ is - einstein ] , in one of two ways . on the one hand",
