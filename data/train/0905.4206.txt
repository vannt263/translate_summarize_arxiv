    "x - ray spectra reveal that warm absorbers ( absorption by partially ionized gas ) are a common feature in compact objects .",
    "although warm absorbers were first detected in the spectra of active galaxies using the @xmath2 satellite @xcite , @xmath0 and @xmath3 grating observations have shown that these occur in x - ray binaries as well , and information about the dynamics and other properties of this gas can have important implications for our understanding of accretion in these systems .",
    "a notable example is the 900 ks observation using the @xmath0 high energy transmission grating ( hetg ) of the seyfert galaxy ngc 3783 @xcite , but this has been surpassed in signal - to - noise by the 2005 spectrum of the galactic black hole transient gro j1655 - 40 @xcite .",
    "the statistical quality of this spectrum makes it one of the best available for testing and refinement of models for warm absorber flows .",
    "gro j1655 - 40 was discovered using batse onboard the compton gamma ray observatory @xcite .",
    "radio observations show apparently superluminal jets @xcite .",
    "optical observations obtained during quiescence show the companion star is a f3 - 5 giant or sub - giant in a 2.62 day orbit around a 5 - 8 @xmath4 compact object @xcite .",
    "deep absorption dips have been observed @xcite suggesting inclination @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "gro j1655 - 40 shows the highest - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) seen in a black hole @xcite .",
    "narrow x - ray absorption lines from highly ionized fe were detected by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "similar features were detected from all the bright dipping low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) observed with xmm - newton @xcite , and from the lmxb gx 13 + 1 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that ionized absorbers are a common feature of lmxbs , although they may not be detected in objects viewed at lower inclination .",
    "the properties of the gro j1655 - 40 warm absorber have been explored by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the spectrum resembles warm absorbers observed from other compact objects in that the lines are blueshifted , and that the inferred doppler blueshift velocities are in the range 300  1600 km / s .",
    "the lines are identified primarily as h- and he - like species of elements with nuclear charge @xmath6 , and there is no clear evidence for absorption by low ionization material such as the iron m - shell uta @xcite .",
    "the unprecedented signal - to - noise may account for the presence of lines from many trace elements previously not detected in x - rays , essentially all elements between na and co. the detection of the 11.92   line , arising from the @xmath7 metastable level of fe xxii , implies a gas density @xmath8 @xmath9 .",
    "the spectrum is richer in features than another spectrum taken earlier in the same outburst , which showed only absorption by fe xxvi l@xmath10 .",
    "the reason for this richness may be due to the higher column density of absorber and to the softer continuum during this particular observation , although this has not been tested quantitatively .    the observed line strengths can be used to infer the ionization balance , i.e. the ratio of abundances of h - like , he - like and lower ion stages for various elements .",
    "models for the ionization balance in the wind then yield the ionization parameter : the ratio of the ionizing flux to the gas density , and the density is constrained by the fe xxii line detection .",
    "this , together with the observed luminosity and the observed outflow speed , led @xcite to conclude that the radius where the outflow originates is too small to allow a wind driven by thermal pressure .",
    "that is , the likely ion thermal speeds in the gas are less than the escape velocity at the inferred radius . on the other hand",
    ", the mass flux can be inferred from the line strengths , and the estimated rate exceeds what is expected from outflows driven by radiation pressure .",
    "this implies that the outflow must be driven by a different mechanism , such as magnetic forces , but this result has been controversial @xcite .",
    "the mass flux in the wind is important for our understanding of the mass and energy budget in accreting compact objects and it is clear that accurate models for the ionization balance and synthetic spectrum are needed in order to reliably determine the properties of the wind .",
    "it is the goal of this paper to study this , and several issues which were not considered by @xcite : ( 1 ) what element abundances are required to account for the lines from the many iron peak elements observed in the spectrum , and what might this tell us about the origin of the gas in the wind and accretion flow ? this is the only spectrum obtained from a warm absorber which clearly detects lines from odd-@xmath1 elements with @xmath11 and from iron peak elements other than fe and ni .",
    "the abundances are of interest since they may contain clues to the evolutionary origin of the system ; @xcite find evidence for enhanced o / h , mg / h , si / h , s / h , and relative to solar , but not fe / h , and suggest that this may be due to enrichment by the supernova which produced the compact object .",
    "( 2 ) what is the possible influence of radiative transfer effects ( line emission , partial covering , or finite energy resolution ) on the inferred wind properties ? analyses of x - ray warm absorber flows so far have not attempted to account in detail for these processes ( although hints to their importance in agn come from the uv ; @xcite ) .",
    "they could systematically skew the derived column densities and ionization conditions .",
    "it is straightforward , although time consuming , to construct models which will test these effects in various scenarios .",
    "( 3 ) are there correlations between line shape or centroid and the ionization conditions where that line is expected to dominate ? a flow with a predominantly ordered velocity field and a central radiation source is likely to show a gradient in ionization balance with position , and therefore with velocity .",
    "this should be manifest as correlations between line width or offset with the ionization degree of its parent ion .",
    "this effect is not found in seyfert galaxy warm absorbers @xcite , but examination of the gro j1655 - 40 spectrum shows differences among the line profile shapes . after careful attention to item ( 2 ) above , we can test this quantitatively .",
    "in the remainder of this paper we present our model fits and interpretation of the @xmath0 hetg spectrum of gro j1655 - 40 , attempting to address the above questions .",
    "this includes various fitting techniques , testing of radiative transfer effects , and discussion of the constraints on element abundances .",
    "finally , we discuss the implications of these results for the dynamics of the outflow , and possible evolutionary history of the source .",
    "the fits in this paper were performed using the same extraction of the hetg data as was used by @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 observed gro j1655 - 40 for a total of 44.6 ks starting at 12:41:44 ut on 2005 april 1 .",
    "data was taken from the acis - s array dispersed by the high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) .",
    "continuous clocking mode was used in order to prevent photon pile - up . as described by @xcite ,",
    "a gray filter was used in order to reduce the zero order counting rate .",
    "data was processed using the ciao reduction package , version 3.2.2 .",
    "the event file was filtered to accept only standard event grades , good - time intervals , and to reject bad pixels .",
    "streaking was removed using the `` destreak '' tool , and spectra were extracted using `` tg_resolve_events '' and `` tg_extract '' .",
    "arfs were produced using the `` fullgarf '' tool along with canned rmfs .",
    "first order heg spectra and arfs and first - order meg spectra and arfs were added using the `` add_grating_spectra '' tool . in this paper",
    "we do not fit to the rxte data obtained simultaneously with the @xmath0 hetg observation , but we do employ the continuum shape derived from the @xcite fits which include the rxte data .    our procedure for analyzing the spectrum of gro j1655 - 40 consists of three separate parts .",
    "first , we fit the spectrum using xspec together with simple analytic models describing the continuum and the lines .",
    "this consists of a continuum shape which is the same as that used by @xcite : a power law plus a disk blackbody and cold absorption .",
    "based on the fits by @xcite , we use a power law index of 3.54 and a disk blackbody temperature with temperature 1.34 kev .",
    "we allow the normalizations of the components to vary , and find a best fit normalization of 515.7@xmath121.5 for the disk blackbody and @xmath130.15 for the power law .",
    "the flux is 2.02 @xmath14 ergs/@xmath15/s 2 - 10 kev .",

    "we allow the values of the wavelengths , widths , and line normalizations to be determined by the xspec minimization .",
    "this results in detections of essentially all the lines with parameters consistent with those of @xcite .",
    "in addition , we propose identifications for some of the lines which were not identified by those authors .",
    "we point out that this procedure differs from those authors in that we fit to a single analytic global continuum , while they fit to a piece - wise powerlaw .",
    "the procedure used here is chosen for comparison with the fits to photoionization models in the next section .",
    "the best - fit to the continuum plus gaussians gives @xmath4018474/8108 .",

    "chi2table ] ) .",
    "this fit is marginally acceptable based on standard arguments derived from @xmath16 statistics , and it is the best of the models presented in this paper .",
    "this serves to illustrate the level of systematic errors , or errors in our continuum , which provide an effective limit to our ability to fit the spectrum .",

    "successive models are offset by unity from each other .",
    "these figures show qualitatively the agreement between the model and the data which we achieve .",
    "the second approach to line fitting is to construct an automated line fitting program .",
    "this takes the same continuum employed in the continuum - only fit , and then experiments with random placements of lines throughout the 1 - 15   range .",
    "these experiments begin with an initial wavelength which is chosen randomly within this range ( but excluding a region within 2 doppler widths of previously found lines ) , and then the line wavelength , width , and optical depth are varied in an attempt to find a best fit ( the wavelength is restricted to a region near the initial wavelength in this procedure ) .",
    "the fit is considered valid if the @xmath16 improves by 3 with the inclusion of the line .",
    "line widths are limited to be less than 8 doppler widths when compared with a turbulent velocity of 100 km / s .",
    "the lines are assumed to be doppler broadened only , and the absorption is a true gaussian absorption profile .",
    "this is in contrast to the xspec gaussian line model , which treats absorption as a negative emission .",
    "as we will show , many of our line fits result in large optical depths , and in this case a voigt profile fit would be preferable .",
    "the pure doppler profile likely results in an over - estimate of the line optical depth , since it can not produce as strong absorption line wings as would a voigt profile .",
    "however , the voigt profile damping parameter value depends on the line identification , and can not be conveniently used as a fitting parameter . in our synthetic spectral modeling , in the following section , we fit to voigt profiles using accurate atomic rates for the damping parameters . for convenience",
    "we refer to this as the notch model , although it assumes gaussian absorption lines rather than true notches .",
    "this procedure yields a total of 292 lines after a total of 20000 attempts at placing random lines .",
    "we neglect lines with equivalent widths less than 3.4 @xmath41 ev",
    ". we do not consider this to be necessarily an exhaustive list of lines in the gro j1655 - 40 spectrum , but likely contains the strongest or least ambiguous features , and it is objective .",
    "this procedure detects all the features in the @xcite table , plus many others which are weaker or blended .",
    "some of these are undoubtedly artifacts of the shortcomings of our continuum model , and others may coincide with regions where bound - free continuum opacity is important .",
    "these are discussed in turn in the following .",
    "this fit yields @xmath42 using the continuum from the xspec gaussian fit .",
    "we refer to this as model 3 ( cf .",
    "chi2table ] ) .",
    "the slightly worse @xmath16 value for this model when compared with model 2 is likely due to the limitations of our automated fitting procedure , particularly when two strong lines are close together or partially overlapping .",
    "in addition to deriving wavelengths , line center optical depths , and widths ( @xmath43 ) , we also derive errors on these quantities based on the @xmath44=3 criterion of @xcite , and we calculate the line equivalent widths by integrating numerically over the best - fit model profile .      the list of lines we detect is given in table [ linelist ] .",
    "this includes the wavelength , width ( @xmath43 ) and equivalent width derived from the automated fitting leading to model 3 .",
    "we also provide identifications for the lines .",
    "this is done by searching the linelist in the xstar @xcite database and choosing the line which has the greatest ratio of optical depth to doppler shift within a doppler shift of @xmath451500 km s@xmath19 . the optical depth used in this determination",
    "is calculated using the warmabs analytic model , which is an implementation of xstar use as an analytic model within the xspec x - ray spectral fitting package , for the conditions in model 4 described in the following section .",
    "we have updated both xstar and warmabs to include all the previously neglected elements with @xmath46 ; this is described in the appendix . note that the criterion for line identification is used to choose among the xstar lines which fall within doppler shifts of @xmath271500 km s@xmath19 , but does not prevent a line from being included if there is no xstar line within that interval . if there is an i d , then the parent ion , xstar wavelength , and upper and lower level designations",
    "are also given in table [ linelist ] .",
    "the identification , together with the optical depth derived from the model 3 fits allows the equivalent hydrogen column density of the absorbing ion to be derived .",

    "another illustration of the effects of saturation is shown in figure [ hheplot ] .",
    "this shows the ratios of he - like to h - like ion abundances inferred from the line equivalent widths and identifications in table [ linelist ] .",
    "these ratios are independent of element abundance , owing to the fact that each ratio is taken between ions from the same element .",
    "this shows that the ratios are all in the range between 10@xmath19 and 10@xmath247 for @xmath248 , but that there is no systematic trend with @xmath1 .",
    "we might expect the ratio to increase with @xmath1 , as higher @xmath1 elements would be generally less highly ionized , for plausible ionization mechanisms .",
    "also shown in figure [ hheplot ] are the contours traced by an xstar photoionization model described in more detail in the appendix .",
    "these are labeled by the value of log(@xmath249 ) , where @xmath250 is the ionization parameter as defined by @xcite ; @xmath251 is the source energy luminosity integrated from 1  1000 ry , @xmath252 is the gas number density , and @xmath253 is the distance from the continuum source to the absorber . these show that a given value of ionization parameter predicts that the he / h abundance ratio should increase between adjacent elements by a factor @xmath2345 .",
    "the figure clearly shows that a single ionization parameter can not account for the ratios displayed by all the elements .",
    "this could indicate the existence of a broad range of ionization parameters in the source , spanning values indicated by this figure . on the other hand",
    ", it could be associated with radiative transfer effects , such as saturation , which make ion fractions inferred from a linear curve of growth unreliable .",
    "possible explanations for the departures from the linear curve of growth include the influence of saturation which causes the curve to flatten when the lines become optically thick in the doppler core .",
    "other possibilities include filling - in of the lines by an additional continuum emission component which is not seen in transmission through the warm absorber , and also radiation transfer effects in the absorber itself .",
    "the latter includes forward scattering , which may also depend on the relative size of the continuum source and the absorber .",
    "also , thermal emission can fill in the lines . in the following subsection",
    "we discuss these in turn .",
    "the standard curve of growth for a resonance line can be written :    @xmath254    @xmath255    where @xmath256 is the photon energy , @xmath257 is the oscillator strength , @xmath258 is the ion fraction , @xmath259 is the element abundance , @xmath260 is the total column density , @xmath232 is the line wavelength , @xmath261 is the turbulent velocity ( including the thermal ion speed ) , and @xmath262 is the profile function , which includes both a doppler core and damping wings .",
    "this is shown in figure [ figcog ] , for various choices of the velocity characterizing the doppler broadening @xmath263 , and for a natural width corresponding to that for the si xiv l@xmath10 line .",
    "this shows that , for a given equivalent width , the effects of saturation are more likely to be important when the doppler broadening is smallest .",
    "that is , the equivalent width where the curve flattens is approximately proportional to the doppler width . as we will show , the widths of many lines from gro j1655 - 40 are not constrained from below by the hetg spectrum .",
    "thus , a possible explanation for the slower than linear curve of growth is that the line doppler widths are small enough such that the strongest lines in figure [ coghlike ] are affected by saturation .",
    "curve of growth for various choices of the velocity characterizing the doppler broadening @xmath263 , and for a damping parameter corresponding to that for the si xiv l@xmath10 line , at a doppler broadening velocity of 20 km s@xmath19 . ]    filling in by continuum from a separate source which is not absorbed by the warm absorber would preferentially affect lines with larger optical depths .",
    "this could qualitatively explain the flattening of the curve of growth which is observed .",
    "however , the filling in would also have the wavelength dependence of the additional continuum component .",
    "although this is unknown , the simplest assumption would be that it is the same as the primary continuum .",
    "we have tested this possibility quantitatively using direct fitting , and will discuss this further in the following section .",
    "the standard curve of growth in equation ( [ curgrowth ] ) assumes the simplest possible geometry and microphysics affecting the line : ( i)the continuum source has negligible size ; ( ii ) the absorber exists only in a narrow region along the line of sight to the continuum source ; ( iii ) the excitation and deexcitation of the transition responsible for the line is affected only by the radiative excitation and spontaneous decay connecting the two atomic levels .",
    "in addition , the gas is assumed to have a velocity field which can be characterized by a maxwellian distribution with a well - defined thermal or turbulent velocity .",
    "if the continuum source has finite size , or if the warm absorber exists outside the line of sight to the source , then the line profiles will be affected by photons which scatter into our line of sight .",
    "although there is no simple general expression for the intensity observed from an extended scattering atmosphere in this case , it is straightforward to show that in the limit of small optical depth , the scattered emission contribution scales proportional to @xmath264 , where @xmath265 is the characteristic size of the continuum source and @xmath253 the characteristic distance from the continuum source to the absorber .",
    "this contribution is independent of optical depth in this limit , and so will not affect the shape of the curve of growth at small @xmath266 .",
    "departures from assumption ( iii ) , concerning the population kinetics , can be expected if the radiative decay of the upper level is suppressed or if the upper level can be populated by another process such as recombination or collisional excitation .",
    "some of these possibilities were discussed by @xcite .",
    "if the upper level can decay via alternate channels , such as branching to other levels radiatively , collisional deexcitation , or autoionization , the basic absorption profile properties will be unchanged ( although these processes can affect the damping parameter ) .",
    "suppression of the upper level decay by collisional deexcitation could occur if the product of line optical depth and electron density , @xmath267 , is large , but this requires optical depth @xmath268 for iron .",
    "this would affect our limits on possible filling - in of the line by collisional or recombination radiation which we present in the next section .",
    "populating the upper level by collisions or recombination requires suitable temperature and ionization conditions .",
    "efficient population by collisional excitation requires temperatures greater than can be accounted for by photoionization heating and radiative cooling , and this in turn will affect the ionization balance .",
    "it also implies the existence of an additional heating mechanism .",
    "we have tested these possibilities quantitatively using direct fitting , and discuss the results below .",
    "many of the issues discussed in the previous section can be tested using direct fitting .",
    "these include : detector resolution , counting statistics , and scattered and thermal ( either collisional or recombination ) emission . in order to do so",
    ", we use the warmabs analytic model which interfaces with the xspec spectral fitting package .",
    "warmabs makes use of a stored , precomputed table of level populations for a family of photoionization models .",
    "it uses these to calculate a synthetic spectrum ` on the fly ' within xspec .",
    "the advantage of this is that it calculates the synthetic spectrum automatically for the energy grid of the data such that it matches the energy resolution of the instrument .",
    "interpolation can introduce significant numerical errors when applied to absorption spectra , since the absorption coefficient can change rapidly over a narrow range in energy .",
    "warmabs calculates all absorption lines using a voigt function including damping due to both radiative and auger decays where applicable .",
    "line profiles are calculated using sub - gridding , on an energy scale which is a fraction of a doppler width , and the opacity and transmittivity then mapped onto the detector grid . bound - free absorption is also included .",
    "warmabs uses the full database and computational routines from the xstar package @xcite , and differs from xstar in that the level populations are pre - calculated rather than calculated simultaneously with the spectrum .",
    "the level populations are calculated using a full ` collisional - radiative ' calculation , albeit with relatively simple model ions in most cases . thus they include the effects of upper level depletion due to thermalization and photoionization automatically .",
    "we have extended the xstar database to include all the trace elements seen in the gro j1655 - 40 spectrum .",
    "a description is provided in the appendix .",
    "warmabs does not calculate the flux transmitted by a fully self - consistent slab of gas , as xstar does .",
    "rather , it calculates the opacity from the illuminated face of such a slab , and then calculates optical depth and transmitted flux analytically by assuming the opacity is uniform throughout the slab .",
    "a real slab will shield its interior , which will then have lower ionization and greater opacity than a slab whose opacity is assumed to be uniform .",
    "thus , the results of warmabs fitting will be absorbing columns which may be greater than would be produced by a real slab .",
    "the importance of this effect depends sensitively on the assumed slab structure , i.e. its geometrical thickness , and so its importance can not be estimated in general . also , this effect is negligible at high ionization parameters .",
    "as we will show , our fits require large ionization parameters .",
    "in this case , the advantages of the energy resolution provided by warmabs outweigh its limitations .",
    "our basic fit assumes that the absorption is provided by a single component of photoionized gas .",
    "we adopt the ionizing continuum used by @xcite which consists of a power law plus disk blackbody , as described in the previous section .",
    "the power law photon index is 3.54 and the disk inner temperature is kt=1.35 kev . in our fit",
    "we account for the curve of growth by adopting a small turbulent velocity , 50 km s@xmath19 , so that the ratios of these lines are on the saturated part of the curve of growth .",
    "we then search for the single ionization parameter which most nearly accounts for all the lines in the spectrum .",
    "we do this using warmabs and the xspec package and stepping through ionization parameter in intervals @xmath269log(@xmath249)=0.1 .",
    "warmabs accept the turbulent velocity as an input , but the actual line width is calculated including both this turbulent velocity and the thermal ion velocity corresponding to the equilibrium temperature . as shown in the appendix figures [ ionbala ]  [ ionbald ] , in order to simultaneously produce the ions of iron ranging from b - like ( fe xxii ) to h - like , an ionization parameter in the range 3@xmath13log(@xmath249)@xmath134 is needed .",
    "we find the best fit at log(@xmath249)=4.0@xmath270.1 , log(n)=23.8 and a blueshift for the absorber of 375 km s@xmath19 .",
    "this can be compared with the radial velocity of the system of 141@xmath271 km s@xmath19 and the orbital semi - amplitude of the secondary star of 215.5 @xmath272.4 km s@xmath19 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the outflow is not moving fast when compared with the maximum velocities characterizing the orbital motion in the system .",
    "we have also performed equivalent fits for this set of assumptions using the isis fitting package @xcite , and have verified that the results are independent of which fitting package is used .",
    "we refer to this single component warmabs with @xmath270 km s@xmath19 as model 4 .",
    "we assume a gas density of 10@xmath231 @xmath9 in calculating the level populations used by warmabs .",
    "we have not extensively tested our results at lower densities , and we point out that it is likely that densities as low as @xmath271 @xmath9 can produce the fe xxii lines .",
    "we employ the same ionizing continuum as derived in the model 1 fit when calculating the populations and gas temperature using xstar . in our fitting for model 4 and subsequent models",
    "we allow the normalizations of the two continuum components to vary .",
    "the best fit flux is 1.8 @xmath14 erg @xmath22 s@xmath19 in the 2  10 kev band . in figures [ fita]-[fitn ]",
    "we show the observed count rate spectrum ( black ) together with all the models discussed in this section as red curves , labeled according to the model number .",
    "strong lines are marked in blue along with parent ion .",
    "as discussed above , and shown in figure [ vofffig ] , the majority of lines have centroid wavelengths which are consistent with a single doppler blueshift , approximately 400 km s@xmath19 with respect to their laboratory values .",
    "the notable exception is the fe xxvi l@xmath10 line near 1.77  which has a centroid wavelength corresponding to a doppler blueshift of @xmath2351300 km s@xmath19 . in model 4 , we adopt the hypothesis that this line arises in a separate velocity component of the flow , which must have a much greater ionization parameter so that it does not show up in the other lines . since the xstar grid of model level populations does not extend to values where fe xxvi is the only ion of significant abundance , we do this by adding a single gaussian component for the high velocity part of this line .",
    "a consequence of this is that the 375 km s@xmath19 component of the flow , which we model with warmabs and an ionization parameter log(@xmath249)=4 , accurately fits to the red part of the fe xxvi l@xmath10 profile , while the gaussian accounts for the rest .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fitfeblowup ] , which shows the region surrounding the line .",
    "the data is shown as the black bars , and model 4 is shown as the dark blue points .",
    "the green points show the continuum + fe xxvi l@xmath10 gaussian model alone .",
    "the equivalent width of the fe xxvi gaussian is 29.6 ev .",
    "the @xmath16 for this model is 34211 for 8187 degrees of freedom .",
    "these parameters are summarized in table [ chi2table ] .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the doppler blueshift of the fe xxvi line is affected by instrumental effects and shortcomings in the available hetg response function .",
    "this could be due to the fact that the continuum count spectrum is steeply decreasing in the line region , as shown in figure [ fitfeblowup ] .",
    "internal scattering could cause photons from the continuum adjacent to the longer wavelength wing of the line to scatter into the line core , and this effect would be stronger on the long wavelength side than on the short wavelength side .",
    "the width of the line spread function is comparable to the line blueshift .",
    "in addition , the wavelength calibration may be affected by the use of continuous clocking mode . on the other hand , other lines in the 1.5  2   region ,",
    "although at slightly longer wavelength , do not show this effect , as exemplified by the fe xxv @xmath272 line .",
    "furthermore , we have confirmed that the response matrix we use reproduces the line spread function obtained from the @xmath0 calibration database .",
    "so , although there is no obvious shortcoming in the response matrix which would explain the discrepancy between the fe xxvi l@xmath10 wavelength shift and those of other lines , we will examine both hypotheses : that the high velocity part of the fe xxvi line is associated with a separate kinematic component ( as in model 4 ) , and that it is not .",
    "the latter case also corresponds to the assumptions of @xcite .",
    "the primary conclusions of this paper , with respect to dynamics , abundances , turbulence , and geometry , are not dependent on this assumption .",
    "the model 4 fit accurately reproduces the strength and shape of the fe xxvi and fe xxv lines , although we predict a slightly stronger red wing on the fe xxv than is observed .",
    "this is the contribution of fe k@xmath10 from lower ion stages of iron , fe xxiv and xxiii .",
    "the strengths of these lines provides a lower bound on the ionization of iron .",
    "we also slightly overestimate the strength of the mn xxv l@xmath10 line , relative to the mn he - like k@xmath10 line . this may be due to an error in the ionization balance for this element ; as shown in figure [ hheplot ]",
    ", there are apparent departures from a simple monotonic trend in the h / he ratio with nuclear charge .",
    "the region longward of 3  includes the lines from ca ( 3.02 , 3.18  ) and ar ( 3.73 , 3.94  ) .",
    "our single component ionization balance is too low for both these elements , adequately accounting for the he - like lines but under - predicting the h - like lines .",
    "we also point out that our assumed line width of 50 km s@xmath19 adequately fits the profiles of essentially all the lines shortward of 6  .",
    "model 4 is based on a physical model for the absorber in gro j1655 - 40 , and it represents the best fit that we can obtain to the spectrum using a single warmabs component . as shown in figure [ fita]-[fitn ] , this accounts for the depths and positions of essentially all the lines in the spectrum .",
    "discrepancies between the model and the data fall in three categories : errors in the continuum , errors in line widths , and errors in line strengths ( including lines which are missing ) . in what follows we will explore these in turn .",
    "as we will show , the best fits we obtain to a physical model have @xmath273 @xmath234 2.9 .",
    "this can be compared with the phenomenological notch fit , model 3 , which has reduced @xmath273 @xmath234 2.2 .",
    "the difference likely represents the ability of the phenomenological notch fit to account for features which may not be physical lines but rather part of the continuum or consequences of calibration uncertainties .",
    "this , we think , represents the ultimate limit in our ability to fit the spectrum . in",
    "what follows , we proceed and attempt to interpret the @xmath16 values from physical models when compared with each other , but without relying on standard interpretations of these values and their relation to probability of random occurrence , etc .",
    "that is , we acknowledge that our fits are not acceptable based on these standard arguments about @xmath16 , but nevertheless interpret confidence intervals on the fitting parameters by evaluating @xmath44 as if they were .    model 4 is designed to fit to the curves of growth of lines from fe xxiv and ni xxvi by having a relatively small turbulent velocity , so that the lines from these ions are at least partially saturated .",
    "this works for these ions , as is apparent from figure [ fitf ] , and it also is consistent with the observed widths of the lines which are not resolved .",
    "however , it does not account for the observed widths of the broader lines , such as si xiii and si xiv , and also for the 2s ",
    "3p lines of fe xxiv near 10.6  .",
    "@xcite adopt a line width of 300 km s@xmath19 , which is a better fit to the observed widths for many lines .",
    "we conclude that saturation with a single profile component , although it accounts for the curves of growth of the lines of fe xxiv , is not consistent with the curves of growth of lines from si xiv , nor is it consistent with observed widths of some of the strong lines .",
    "a possible explanation is that the lines consist of multiple narrow components closely spaced in velocity so they appear blended together in the hetg , and where the components furthest from line center are unsaturated and so appear only in the low members of the li - like 2s  np series .",

    "crosses are data , blue is model 4 , red is model 5 , green is the fe xxvi l@xmath10 gaussian contribution to model 4 . ]",
    "another way to fit the fe xxvi l@xmath10 line is to add a higher ionization parameter warmabs component to the fit .",
    "we do this in model 5 , which has a warmabs component with the same ionization parameter as model 4 , but with the addition of a second component at an ionization parameter which can make the fe xxvi line sufficiently strong without over - producing the lower ionization lines .",
    "this model also has a turbulent velocity of 200 km s@xmath19 .",
    "we vary the column densities and element abundances of both components in order to find the best fit . in doing so , we force both components to have the same bulk outflow velocity , the same turbulent velocity , and the same elemental abundances .",
    "thus , the two components are allowed to differ only in their ionization parameters and column densities .",
    "this produces a fit with @xmath274 .",
    "this fit is also shown in figures [ fita ]  [ fitn ] . in figure [ fitfeblowup ]",
    "we show a blowup of the iron k region , comparing this model with model 4 .",
    "model 4 is decomposed into the part accounted for by the gaussian ( green ) and the total ( blue ) .",
    "model 5 is shown as the red points .",
    "this shows that in spite of the nearly equivalent @xmath16 , model 5 does less well than model 4 in fitting the iron lines ; it generally over - predicts their strengths .",
    "this is particularly true in the case of the fe xxvi l@xmath10 line . since this model has the same 375 km s@xmath19 outflow velocity as model 4 , the best fit accounts for the blue edge of the fe xxvi l@xmath10 by over - predicting the line near line center and the red edge .",
    "thus , the conclusions from this model differ from model 4 ( and subsequent models ) in that they do not depend on the existence of two kinematic components .    in other ways , the comparison between models 5 and 4 reflects the fact that model 5 has on average a higher ionization parameter . as a result ,",
    "model 5 tends to over - predict the ratio of h - like to he - like lines , compared with both model 4 and with the observation .",
    "also , model 5 has a larger turbulent velocity , and therefore predicts a steeper curve of growth for most lines .",
    "this fact is apparent from the fe xxiv lines in the 6  7   region .",
    "on the other hand , model 5 fits better than model 4 to lines which appear to follow the linear curve of growth , such as the l@xmath275/l@xmath10 lines of si xxiv , and also to lines which are detectably broadened , such as the 10.6   doublet of fe xxiv .",
    "an additional possible reason for the apparent saturation of the curves of growth could be due to systematic effects or calibration uncertainties associated with the @xmath0 telescope , grating and detector .",
    "this could lead to apparent scattering of photons in the continuum into the cores of absorption lines which is not accounted for by the detector response matrix , thus preventing the residual flux in the lines from going to zero .",
    "this effect can not be evaluated accurately without calibration data which includes narrow absorption line features , but we can get an indication of its plausibility by fitting to a model which includes some ` leakage ' of photons into lines from adjacent continuum regions .",
    "we do this by fitting to a partial covering model in which the warmabs component is partially diluted , i.e. @xmath276 where @xmath277 is the fraction of scattered continuum at each energy .",
    "we also adopt a turbulent velocity of 200 km s@xmath19 for this model , since we do not need to account for saturated curves of growth ; the dilution of the warmabs lines tends to flatten the curves of growth .",
    "we show this as model 6 in table [ chi2table ] and in figures [ fita ]  [ fitn ] .",
    "this model has @xmath278 , and so is the best of the fits using the warmabs model .",
    "it also employs a turbulent velocity which is sufficient to account for the widths of resolved lines while at the same time fitting to the curves of growth for fe xxiv and ni xxvi .",
    "the best - fit value of @xmath279 is 0.37 .",
    "we can interpret this as being due to true partial covering in the object , i.e. if the continuum source is more extended than the absorber , or as being due to instrumental scattering which is not accounted for by the response matrix we used .",
    "the latter can be further subdivided into shortcomings in the response in accounting for the line spread function ( lsf ) for the hetg which occur in the core region of the lsf , and shortcomings which occur in the wings .",
    "the core region of the lsf . can be approxmiately represented by a gaussian with full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath2351300 km s@xmath19 at the wavelength of the iron line , 1.77  .",
    "so two intrinsically narrow lines of equal intensity will fill the region between them to 30@xmath280 of their peak intensities if they are separated by @xmath235 900 km s@xmath19 .",
    "this is comparable to the typical line widths we find in our fits .",
    "however , as discussed previously , the response matrix we use does accurately reproduce the lsf in the core region , so it would require a large error in the calibration files , the lsf and the resulting response matrix , in order to account for the filling in of the lines in this way .",
    "another possibility is that there exists significant scattering in the line wings which is not accounted for by the calibration .",
    "this is difficult to evaluate quantitatively , except to point out that the uncertainty in the lsf at the extremes of the wings appears to be at most @xmath2342  4 @xmath280 of the maximum value . in order to make up the covering fractions we require ,",
    "the integrated area under the wings would have to be @xmath23430 ",
    "40 @xmath280 of the area in the core of the line .",
    "the wings would have to extend to @xmath23510 times the @xmath43 of the core , or @xmath2357600 km s@xmath19 .",
    "we can not evaluate the likelihood of this possibility reliably , and can not conclusively rule it out , although such a large departure from the calibration would be surprising .",
    "this observation differs from typical observations in its use of continuous clocking mode .",
    "this prevents the use of detector regions adjacent to the readout strip for background subtraction , but the counting rate in this case is high so that background should not be important at the levels considered here . the fact that the response matrix agrees with the lsf in the core of the line is further evidence that the use of continuous clocking is not the source of the apparent partial covering .",
    "we conclude that true partial covering in the source is more likely than instrumental effects , and thus plays a role in determining the line curves of growth and the overall quality of the fit . owing to its superior @xmath16",
    "we adopt this model as the one which most nearly accounts for the observed spectrum and consider the physical assumptions to be most nearly correct for the gro j1655 - 40 outflow .",
    "we emphasize that the partial covering does not account for the high velocity component in fe xxvi l@xmath10 , and model 6 includes the same high velocity gaussian contribution to this line as model 4 .",
    "we also have examined the possible influence of thermal emission filling in lines on the one - component warmabs fit , i.e. model 4 .",
    "that is , we have included an additional emission component , which emits due to ` thermal ' ( i.e. collisional and recombination ) processes rather than resonance scattering .",
    "this component is calculated using the photemis model , and is the emission analog of warmabs .",
    "it is assumed to have the same ionization parameter , abundances , redshift , and turbulent velocity as the warm absorber component .",
    "we allow the normalization of the emission component , which is proportional to its emission measure , to vary , along with the optical depth of the warm absorber .",
    "in doing so , we find the best fit to be that with zero thermal emission , and the statistical upper limit on the thermal emission component corresponds to an emission measure @xmath281 @xmath9",
    ". we will discuss the implications of this in the next section .",
    "we have also examined the possibility that the absorption is produced in a plasma which is in coronal equilibrium instead of photoionized .",
    "this is what might be expected if the gas is heated mechanically , and if the outflow is due to thermal expansion of such a mechanically heated wind .",
    "this is done using the xspec analytic model hotabs , which calculates the absorption spectrum of partially ionized gas if the ionization is due to electron impact .",
    "the free parameter describing the ionization balance in this gas is the electron temperature .",
    "a key difference between a photoionized gas and a gas in coronal ionization equilibrium is that the ionization abundance distributions from photoionized gas have more overlap in parameter space than does a coronal gas .",
    "that is , at a given temperature each element in a coronal gas is most likely to exist in a pure ionization state , while at a given ionization parameter in a photoionized gas , each element is likely to have a mixture of two or more ionization states .",
    "in addition , the ions which can coexist in a coronal plasma all tend to have similar ionization potential .",
    "a consequence is that it is impossible for coronal equilibrium to allow the coexistence of h - like or he - like ions of elements with very different nuclear charge , eg .",
    "fe xxv and s xvi .",
    "in contrast , a photoionized plasma at log(@xmath249)=4 does allow this .",
    "for this reason , coronal equilibrium models do not fit the gro j1655 - 40 spectra as well as photoionized models .",
    "we have also varied the elemental abundances and explored the limits for these allowed by the @xmath16 statistical criterion . in doing this , we rely on the criterion of @xcite , where a 99@xmath280 confidence interval is defined by the values of the parameter which fall within @xmath282 of the best fit value .",
    "we display these results graphically in figure [ abundfig ] for the elements o  ni . the abundances here are taken relative to the solar values of @xcite for abundant elements , and @xcite for the new elements added for this calculation . in all of our models we fix the abundance of fe at 1 relative to solar . in figure [ abundfig ]",
    "the results of model 4 are shown in black , and the results of model 6 are shown in red .",

    "the abundance patterns shown in figure [ abundfig ] are crudely consistent between models 4 and 6 , and show enhanced abundances of cr and mn relative to fe .",
    "results for ca - v are ambiguous , and suggest no strong enhancement , while the abundances of na - cl are smaller than the solar ratio , relative to fe .    the overabundances of fe - group elements strongly suggest that the observed matter has been subject to high - temperature burning conditions . for this reason ,",
    "we have compared the observed abundances against nucleosynthesis models in massive stars , and more particularly resulting from the hydrostatic c- , o- and si - burning phases .",
    "we use the presupernova nucleosynthesis yields calculated in model stars of 15 , 20 , and 25 solar masses with solar metallicity @xcite .",
    "each of the c- , o- or si - burning zone has been weighted by the relative masses needed to best reproduce the observations . the relative mass ratio ( c : o : si ) obtained",
    "is ( 6:1:1 ) for the three model stars . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_abth1 ] , the predicted abundances ( relative to solar ) are in rather close agreement with the observed pattern for models 4 and 6 .    as far as the light elements are concerned , the agreement between theory and observation is rather good .",
    "the o overabundance predicted reaches 1.3 ( 1.8 for the 20 m@xmath284 star ) in agreement with the 1.5 upper limit determined in the 2-component model .",
    "note , however , that the o abundance is not well constrained by the observed spectrum owing to strong interstellar absorption .",
    "furthermore , we consider it possible that the low @xmath1 elements are affected by a separate ionizing continuum component .",
    "this could suppress absorption from o even if the abundance were greater than solar , although this is contrived given the absence of observations of such radiation .",
    "we also point out the possibility that the ne and o lines are at least partly of interstellar origin ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this would require a coincidence in velocity between the gro j1655 outflow and the intervening gas .",
    "it would also place more severe constraints on the nucleosynthetic models , since it would decrease the inferred abundances of these elements intrinsic to the source . concerning the underproduction of na",
    ", the disagreement may be due to uncertainties affecting the nuclear reaction rates or the thermodynamical conditions in the combustion zones .",
    "for the heavier elements above ca , the agreement is still good though discrepancies can be seen in particular for ti , v , and co. it should be mentioned here that , in the nucleosynthesis simulations , all unstable nuclei produced have been assumed to @xmath275-decay ( except the long - lived @xmath285mn ) .",

    "it is interesting to compare with the results of the optical abundance determination by @xcite .",
    "these authors find evidence for enhanced o / h , mg / h , si / h , s / h relative to solar , but fe / h and cr / h are approximately solar .",
    "this differs from our results for models 4 and 6 , insofar as they can be compared , since @xcite do not measure abundances for mn , co , and ni . the conclusions of @xcite have not been confirmed in an investigation by @xcite .",
    "this also underscores the fact that the abundances we measure are relative to each other , and all are for elements heavier than o. we have assumed that iron is solar and quote other abundances relative to that , but we have no constraints on abundances for light elements , or for any abundances relative to hydrogen .",
    "other implications of our models include the fact that the curves of growth , in the absence of partial covering , indicate a velocity structure which has a small turbulent velocity , @xmath23550 km s@xmath19 at the same time as a larger bulk velocity , @xmath235400 km s@xmath19 . since the radial velocity of the groj1655 - 40 system is 141@xmath271 km s@xmath19 , this implies an outflow consisting of material which is cold or still compared with the bulk flow .",
    "this is unusual when compared with flows which are well studied in stars and non - thermal outflows from compact objects .",
    "all of our models fit to the iron k region by assuming the existence of a separate , higher ionization component which is primarily responsible for producing the fe xxvi l@xmath10 line .",
    "this is because essentially all the other lines in the spectrum are consistent with a single ionization parameter and outflow velocity .",
    "models 4 and 6 fit the fe xxvi l@xmath10 line using an ad hoc gaussian , while model 5 fits it using a separate warmabs component . although the latter approach is more physically consistent , it does not fit the feature as well because for this model we force the two components to have the same outflow velocity .    in either case , we find that the majority of lines fit to a single ionization component , log(@xmath249)@xmath2354 .",
    "in addition to this , we have the observed luminosity @xmath286 erg s@xmath19 @xcite and density constraints from the fe xxii metastable line implying @xmath287 .",
    "taken together , these determine the location of the absorber : @xmath288 cm , and its size : @xmath289 cm . in these equations @xmath290 is the luminosity in units of @xmath291 erg s@xmath19 , @xmath292 is the density in units of 10@xmath231 @xmath9 and @xmath293 .",
    "that is , for plausible values , @xmath294 cm , @xmath295 cm .",
    "this location can be compared with the ` compton radius ' within which photoionized gas can not escape the gravity of the black hole @xcite , which is @xmath296 , where @xmath297 is the temperature of the photoionized gas in units of 10@xmath298k , and for the gro j1655 - 40 spectrum this value is @xmath130.03 and the mass of the black hole is 5  8 @xmath4 .",
    "if so , @xmath299 cm .",
    "thus the inferred wind location is well within the compton radius and is inconsistent with an outflow driven by thermal expansion , even though weak flows are possible at @xmath300 as stated by @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with that of @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", we note that the virial radius corresponding to the outflow speed we measure is 1.3 @xmath301 cm , considerably greater than the position we infer from the x - ray ionization balance .",
    "this , together with the fact that the outflow speed is comparable to the orbital speed in the system raise the possibility that the outflow could be associated with the secondary star or a region of the binary which is at comparable distance from the black hole .",
    "if so , then the radius we infer from the ionization balance arguments is an underestimate .",
    "this is difficult to understand in view of the density constraints from the fe xxii lines ; it would require that the metastable level of fe xxii were populated by radiative pumping rather than by collisions .",
    "this , in turn , would require that the intensity of the radiation in the @xmath302 region to be close to lte , and there is no known source for such radiation far from the black hole .",
    "in addition , the observed outflow speed does not appear to vary during the observation @xcite , which spanned @xmath23520@xmath280 of an orbital period , which argues against an origin associated with the companion star or accretion stream .",
    "thus , we consider this possibility to be unlikely .",
    "another astrophysical system which appears to show a comparable contrast between line turbulent width and outflow velocity are fu orionis stars . in these systems",
    "the terminal velocity of the wind is 300 - 400 km / s , and the rotational broadening ( seen in absorption ) of the wind is about 50 km / s @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic turbulent velocity needed to produce the lines is likely much smaller .",
    "if so , the contrast between outflow and turbulent velocities is comparable to the contrast between the observed width and the virial speed at the inferred position for the gro j1655 - 40 outflow .",
    "we note also that the flow timescale is @xmath303s .",
    "this can be compared with the recombination timescale @xmath304s , showing that the assumption of ionization equilibrium is valid for these simple assumptions about the density and location of the outflow .",
    "this does not change qualitatively if the absorber is located at the virial radius .",
    "we can also explore the implications of the emission measure upper limit derived in the previous section , @xmath281 @xmath9 . the emission measure expected from a constant density shell with size derived from the ionization parameter , density and thickness",
    "is @xmath305 , where @xmath306 is the solid angle of the warm absorber / emitter .",
    "so we infer @xmath307 or @xmath308 for the most likely value of @xmath290 .",
    "this can be compared with the constraint derived by @xcite which is @xmath309 based on the observed limit on the fe xxiv 2p ",
    "3s emission line at 11.43  .",
    "we can also then estimate the mass loss rate in the outflow : @xmath310 gm s@xmath19 where @xmath311 is the outflow speed in units of 100 km s@xmath19 ; so @xmath312 gm s@xmath19 for our fits .",
    "this is small compared with the mass accretion rate required to fuel the x - ray source , @xmath313 gm @xmath19 .",
    "the @xcite limit on the solid angle allows a considerably larger mass loss rate , @xmath1310@xmath280 of the accretion rate .",
    "another conclusion of our work is the existence of two velocity components , one with ionization parameter log(@xmath249)=4 and speed @xmath314=375 km s@xmath19 relative to the earth , and the other with higher speed and much greater ionization parameter .",
    "we find for this second component a speed @xmath2351400 km s@xmath19 , and infer that the ionization parameter be high enough that fe xxvi and ni xxviii are the only ions with appreciable abundance , say log(@xmath315 .",
    "then the mass flux is = @xmath316 gm s@xmath19 , where we have assumed a source luminosity 5 @xmath317 erg s@xmath19 and @xmath318 is the speed in units of 1000 km s@xmath19 .",
    "it is more difficult to constrain the fractional solid angle of this component than it is for the lower ionization component because any emission may be masked by the lower velocity component , and we have not attempted to test this .",
    "it is clear that this component can carry more mass than the low ionization component if its solid angle exceeds 0.02 .",
    "however , the radial location of this component can not be reliably established , since the features in the spectrum which provide density constraints do not share the outflow velocity of this component .",
    "the results found here agree qualitatively with those of @xcite in the sense that the ionization parameter and density of the flow containing most of the lines imply a wind location which is too close to the black hole to be easily explained by a driving thermal mechanism .",
    "we favor a scenario in which there are two components to the flow , and the lower ionization component is somewhat less ionized and the higher ionization component is more ionized than the single component found by @xcite .",
    "our spectral fitting allows us to constrain elemental abundances , and we find enhanced abundances for several elements in the iron peak .",
    "we do not find a pattern of systematic enhancements for @xmath10-capture elements .",
    "this work was funded in part by a grant from the chandra theory program .",
    "we thank the referee , frits paerels , for many constructive comments .",
    "in order to model the spectrum of gro j1655 - 40 we have made modifications and enhancements of the xstar photoionization code @xcite . this code calculates the transfer of x - rays and other ionizing radiation , and the ionization balance , opacity and reprocessed emission from gas under a variety of physical conditions .",
    "it contains a relatively complete and up - to - date collection of atomic cross sections , rate coefficients and atomic energy levels .",
    "the code and atomic database , along with the ` warmabs / photemis ' analytic models for xspec , are freely available , distributed as part of the ftools package , and have been widely used in interpreting x - ray spectra .",
    "the standard xstar distribution includes all abundant even-@xmath1 elements ( plus n ) , i.e. : h , he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , fe and ni . in order to model gro j1655 - 40 we have added all the other elements with @xmath46 , with the exception of li , be , and b. the atomic data needed to do this , in addition to the resulting ionization balance for an optically thin gas , are discussed in this appendix .",
    "these data include : energy levels , line wavelengths , oscillator strengths , photoionization cross sections , recombination rate coefficients , and electron impact excitation and ionization rates .",
    "distorted wave dielectronic and radiative recombination rate coefficients , photoionization cross sections , and photoexcitation - autoionization rates have been calculated @xcite for ions of these elements belonging to the h - like through na - like isoelectronic sequences and are also available in the ornl adas database @xcite .",
    "concerning the other atomic parameters , a survey of atomic databases @xcite reveals that they are far from complete for any of these elements .",
    "therefore we rely heavily on hydrogenic scaling for many of these quantities .    in order to model the spectrum we have modified the xspec analytic model warmabs in order to account for the new elements .",
    "warmabs uses the optically thin ionization balance calculated by xstar , along with the same atomic database as xstar , to calculate the synthetic spectrum expected for a gas seen in transmission with a given ionization parameter , column density , turbulent velocity and abundance set .",
    "this takes into account all of the absorption processes , i.e. lines and photoionization cross sections , included in xstar .",
    "a complementary model , photemis , calculates the emission spectrum expected from such a gas , but that is not used in the calculations presented here .",

    "we do not have evaluated wavelengths for the k lines of na , p , cl , and k.      recombination rate coefficients were taken from the calculations reported in the series of the papers by badnell and coworkers @xcite and available from the website .",
    "these are available for all elements he  zn and for isoelectronic sequences h  mg - like for both dielectronic ( dr ) and radiative ( rr ) recombination . for isoelectronic sequences al - like through ni - like , we make use of rates from @xcite , which cover ions of si , s , ar , ca , fe , and ni in these isosequences . for ions of other elements in these isosequences",
    "we interpolate along isoelectronic sequence .",
    "xstar does not directly use the total recombination rate , but rather calculates rates onto a set of spectroscopic levels , typically with principle quantum numbers @xmath3256 , using photoionization cross sections and the milne relation . then it calculates a photoionization cross section for one or more fictitious superlevels such that the total recombination rate for the superlevel(s ) plus the spectroscopic levels adds to the desired total rate taken from one of the above compilations .",
    "the super levels are generally assumed to decay directly to ground without the emission of any observable cascade radiation .",
    "the exception is the decay of the h- and he- isoelectronic sequences , for which we have explicitly calculated the decay of the superlevels to the spectroscopic levels using a full cascade calculation @xcite .",
    "a key input affecting the ionization balance is the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) assumed for the source .",
    "we take the spectrum adopted by @xcite , consisting of a disk black body with inner temperature kt=1.35 kev , plus a power law with photon index @xmath326 .",
    "the normalizations are chosen such that the low - energy cross - over between the two components is at 1 kev .",
    "below this energy we assume that the spectrum is flat ( in photons ) .",
    "we assume that the spectrum incident on the gas in the groj1655 system is not affected by interstellar absorption .",
    "this spectrum is much steeper in the x - ray band than the conventional @xmath3272 power law applied to agn .",
    "the ionization balance is correspondingly quite different in the sense that the mean ionization is lower at a given value of the ionization parameter in the steep spectrum case .",
    "our choice of spectrum is deficient in photons between @xmath2341 and 100 ry , relative to higher energies .",
    "this leads the gas to be thermally unstable , as originally described by @xcite .",
