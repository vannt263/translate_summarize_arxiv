    "quantum entanglement plays a central role in the emerging fields of quantum computation@xcite , quantum cryptography@xcite , quantum teleportation@xcite , dense coding@xcite and quantum communication@xcite .",
    "the characterisation of entanglement is a challenging problem@xcite and considerable effort has been invested in characterising entanglement in a variety of contexts@xcite .",
    "one such context , quantum teleportation , has played a crucial role in understanding how entanglement can be used as a resource for communication .",
    "the recent experimental demonstrations@xcite suggest that quantum teleportation could be viewed as an achievable experimental technique to quantitatively investigate quantum entanglement .",
    "teleportation is a way of transmitting an unknown quantum state to a distant receiver with far better reliability than can be achieved classically . as the entanglement of the enabling resource",
    "is degraded , the fidelity of the teleportation protocol is diminished .",
    "in this paper we attempt to make this intuition more precise using specific examples from quantum optics .",
    "three entangled resources are considered : states with fixed total photon number , number states entangled at a beam splitter , and the two - mode squeezed vacuum state@xcite .",
    "the examples we discuss exhibit quantum correlations between the photon number in each mode and , simultaneously , between the phase of each mode .    in reality",
    ", the entanglement will not be perfect , but degraded to some extent by uncontrolled interactions with an environment during formation .",
    "to model this we consider phase fluctuations on each mode independently . in the limit of completely random phase",
    "we are left with only the classical intensity ( photon number ) correlations .",
    "the state is no longer entangled and the fidelity of the protocol depends only on the classical intensity correlations remaining in the resource .",
    "intuitively entanglement refers to correlations between distinct subsystems that can not be achieved in a classical statistical model . of course correlations",
    "can exist in classical mechanics , but entanglement refers to a distinctly different kind of correlation at the level of quantum probability amplitudes .",
    "the essential difference between quantum and classical correlations can be described in terms of the separability of states@xcite .",
    "a density operator of two subsystems is separable if it can be written as the convex sum@xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are density matrices for the two subsystems and the @xmath3 are positive weights satisfying @xmath4 .",
    "for example , for two harmonic oscillators ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) the density operator which has correlated energy @xmath7 is separable , ( where we use the notation @xmath8 ) while the pure state @xmath9 has the same classical correlation but is not separable . in this form",
    "we see that is possible for a separable and an entangled state to share similar classical correlations for some variables .",
    "consider a communication protocol in which the results of measurements made on a physical system are transmitted to a distant receiver .",
    "the goal of the receiver is to reconstruct the physical state of the source , using only local resources , conditioned on the received information .",
    "the communication that takes place is of course entirely classical . in a teleportation protocol",
    "there is one additional feature : quantum correlations , entanglement , are first shared between the sending and receiving station .",
    "the degree of entanglement shared by sender and receiver is called the teleportation _",
    "resource_. if there is no shared quantum correlation between the sender and receiver , the protocol is called classical .",
    "the extent and nature of the quantum correlations in the resource determine the fidelity of the protocol . under ideal conditions",
    "the unknown state of some physical system at the transmitting end can be perfectly recreated in another physical system at the receiving end .",
    "there are many ways in which actual performance can differ from the ideal . in this paper",
    "we analyse the change in the performance of teleportation protocols as the degree of entanglement in the resource is varied by decoherence .",
    "our primary objective is to use the fidelity of a teleportation protocol to compare and contrast different kinds of entangled oscillator states .    a general teleportation protocol proceeds as follows .",
    "the sender , alice , has a _",
    "state , @xmath10 , she wishes to teleport to bob , the receiver .",
    "alice and bob each have access to one part of an entangled bipartite physical system prepared in the state @xmath11 . in this paper",
    "the bipartite physical system is a two - mode electromagnetic field . in order to send the state of the target to bob",
    ", alice performs a joint measurement on the target and her mode .",
    "she then sends the information gained from these measurements to bob via a classical channel .",
    "bob performs local unitary transformations on the mode in his possession according to the information alice sends to him , thereby attempting to recreate the initial target state .",
    "we quantify the quality of the protocol by the probability that bob s received state is the same as the target state .",
    "this quantity is known as the _",
    "fidelity_.    the fidelity of quantum teleportation protocol is determined by the degree of shared entanglement , the quality of the measurements made by the sender , the quality of the classical communication channels used and how well bob can implement the desired unitary transformations . in this paper",
    "we will discuss only the first of these ; the amount of shared entanglement . in the original teleportation protocol@xcite ,",
    "the bipartite system was made up of two systems each described by a two dimensional hilbert space , that is to say , two qubits , and the shared entangled state was a _ maximally _",
    "entangled state@xcite . in the case of two correlated harmonic oscillators , or two field modes",
    ", we can not define maximal entanglement in quite the same way , as the entropy of each component system can be arbitrarily large . in this paper",
    "we define extremal entangled pure states of two field modes in terms of the total mean photon number and the total maximum photon number .    in the case of a system with a finite dimensional hilbert space , a state of maximum ( von neumann )",
    "entropy is simply the identity operator in that hilbert space .",
    "a natural generalisation of this idea to infinite hilbert spaces would define a maximum entropy state subject to some constraint , such as mean energy or total energy .",
    "these of course define the canonical ensemble and micro canonical ensemble of statistical mechanics . in the case of",
    "entangled pure states the araki - lieb@xcite inequality indicates that the entropy of each component system is equal .",
    "as the entropy of a harmonic oscillator scales with mean energy , this indicates that each component subsystem has the same mean energy .",
    "if we maximise the entropy of each subsystem subject to a constraint on the mean energy , the state must be a thermal state .",
    "the entangled pure two mode state for which the reduced density operator of each mode is thermal , is the squeezed vacuum state .",
    "@xmath12 the mean photon number in each mode is given by @xmath13 .",
    "if , however , we constrain the total photon number , @xmath14 , of each mode we get a very different expression for a maximally entangled state , @xmath15 the entropy of the reduced state of each mode is @xmath16 while the mean photon number is @xmath17 .",
    "while squeezed vacuum states may be achieved in the laboratory , states with fixed total photon number have not been produced , and will not be possible until we have a reliable @xmath14 photon source .",
    "there are now a couple of proposals for such sources@xcite and it may not be too long before they are used in teleportation schemes .    teleportation fidelity for infinite dimensional hilbert spaces must necessarily vary from unity for an arbitrary target state , as the notion of a maximally entangled resource differs from the finite dimensional case",
    ". the teleportation protocol can also be degraded by unknown incoherent processes that corrupt the purity of the shared entanglement .",
    "of course in some cases these incoherent processes may destroy the correlations entirely , for example by absorbing all the photons in each mode before alice and bob get to use them . in this paper , however , we will only consider those decoherence processes that change the purity of the states and leave unchanged the classical intensity correlations .",
    "in a recent paper by milburn and braunstein@xcite a teleportation protocol was presented using joint measurements of the photon number difference and phase sum on two field modes .",
    "this protocol is possible because the number difference and phase sum operators commute , thus allowing determination of these quantities simultaneously and to arbitrary accuracy .",
    "number _ sum _ and phase _ difference _ operators also commute , implying that if eigenstates of these operators can be found then a teleportation protocol is possible .",
    "such a protocol is discussed below .",
    "recently , teleportation using number sum and phase difference measurements was described  @xcite .",
    "that work did not address how the degree of entanglement in the resource changes the teleportation fidelity as we do here .    because the number sum and phase difference operators commute we look for simultaneous eigenstates of these observables .",
    "consider states of the form @xmath18 which are eigenstates of number sum with eigenvalue @xmath14 .",
    "the labels @xmath19 and @xmath20 refer to the sender s and receiver s component of the entangled modes respectively , and the @xmath21 satisfy @xmath22 . this state will be maximally entangled when the @xmath23 are all equal , giving the resource , @xmath24 this state tends towards eigenstates of phase difference as @xmath25 . to see this",
    "consider the joint phase probability density of eq .",
    "( [ eq : idealres ] ) , which is determined by the ideal joint phase operator projection operator @xmath26 as @xmath27 substituting the state in eq .",

    "( [ eq : idealres ] ) tend to eigenstates of phase difference with increasing @xmath14 .",
    "the state to be teleported , the target state , can be written in the general form @xmath33 the input state to the protocol is then @xmath34 if alice measures the number sum of the target and her component of the entangled resource ( i.e. @xmath35 ) with result @xmath36 , the conditional state of the total system is @xmath37^{-1/2}\\sum_{n } c_{q - n+n } { | q - n+n \\rangle_{t}}{| n - n \\rangle_{a}}{| n \\rangle_{b } } , \\label{eq : condqideal}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 runs from @xmath39 to @xmath14 . the probability of obtaining the result @xmath36 is @xmath40 the subscript @xmath41 emphasises that this probability refers to the idealised resource .",

    "how well the teleportation protocol performs , we shall consider some examples .",
    "let the target state be a number state , @xmath49 so the only coefficient available is @xmath50 , which is one .",
    "we find that the teleportation fidelity is unity , independent of the measurement of @xmath36 , because the only term appearing in the summations of both the fidelity and the probability is that corresponding to @xmath50 .",
    "hence , this protocol works perfectly if the target is a number state .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fideal ] we show the average fidelity as a function of the total photon number in the resource for a coherent state target with amplitude @xmath51 .",
    "it is clear that increasing the number of photons in the entangled resource improves the teleportation protocol .",
