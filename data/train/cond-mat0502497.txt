    "a simple way of capturing the dynamics of granular media under rapid flow conditions is through an idealized fluid of smooth , inelastic hard spheres .",
    "the inelasticity of collisions is only accounted for by a ( constant ) coefficient of normal restitution @xmath0 that only affects the translational degrees of freedom of grains . despite the simplicity of the model",
    ", it has been widely used as a prototype to understand some of the physical mechanisms involved in granular flows , especially those related to the inelasticity of granular collisions . in particular ,",
    "one of the most characteristic features of granular fluids , as compared with normal fluids , is the spontaneous formation of velocity vortices and density clusters when evolving freely .",
    "this clustering instability can be well described through a linear stability analysis of the hydrodynamic equations and follows from the presence of a dissipation term in the equation for the balance of energy .",
    "an important feature of this instability is that it is confined to long wavelengths ( small wave numbers ) and so it can be avoided for small enough systems .",
    "first detected by goldhirsch and zanetti @xcite and mcnamara @xcite , the clustering problem has attracted much attention in the past few years , especially from a computational point of view @xcite .    in the case of a low - density gas , accurate predictions for the unstable hydrodynamic modes have been made from the ( inelastic ) boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "in particular , a critical length @xmath1 is identified , so that the system becomes unstable when its linear size is larger than @xmath1 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath1 on the coefficient of restitution @xmath2 predicted by kinetic theory compares quite well with numerical results obtained by using the direct simulation monte carlo method @xcite .    for finite higher densities ,",
    "these instabilities have been studied by several authors using macroscopic or kinetic equations @xcite",
    ". a careful study of the dispersion relations has been recently carried out by van noije and ernst @xcite from the enskog kinetic theory but neglecting any dependence of the pressure and of the transport coefficients on inelasticity .",
    "specifically , they assume that the expressions for the hydrostatic pressure , the shear viscosity , the bulk viscosity , and the thermal conductivity are the same as those for the _ elastic _ gas @xcite , except that the temperature still depends explicitly on time to account for the homogenous cooling . however , given that the effect of inelasticity on dense fluid transport is quite important in the undriven case @xcite ( see for instance , fig .",

    "the enskog kinetic equation can be considered as the extension of the boltzmann equation to finite densities .",
    "as happens for elastic collisions , the inelastic enskog equation provides a semiquantitative description of the hard sphere system that neglects the effects of correlations between the velocities of the two particles that are about to collide ( molecular chaos assumption ) .",
    "the enskog approximation is expected to be valid for short times since as the system evolves corrections to the enskog equation due to multiparticle collisions , including recollision events ( `` ring '' collisions ) should be incorporated .",
    "the latter are expected to be stronger for fluids with inelastic collisions where the colliding pairs tend to be more focused .",
    "therefore , some deviations from molecular chaos have been observed in molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations @xcite of granular fluids as the density increases .",
    "although the existence of these correlations restricts the range of validity of the enskog equation , the latter can be still considered as a good approximation especially at the level of macroscopic properties ( such as transport coefficients ) . in particular , the enskog results presents quite a good agreement with md simulations and even with real experiments . in the case of computer simulations ,",

    "@xcite ) shows that the enskog kinetic theory @xcite successfully models the density and granular temperature profiles away from the vibrating container bottom and quantitatively explains the temperature inversion observed in experiments .",
    "all these results clearly show the applicability of the enskog theory for densities outside the boltzmann limit ( @xmath9 ) and values of dissipation beyond the quasielastic limit . in this context",
    ", one can conclude that the enskog equation provides a unique basis for the description of dynamics across a wide range of densities , length scales , and degrees of dissipation .",
    "no other theory with such generality exists .",
    "the explicit knowledge of the navier - stokes transport coefficients as well as of the cooling rate for inelastic hard spheres @xcite allows one to solve the linearized hydrodynamic equations around the homogeneous cooling state ( hcs ) and identify the conditions for stability as functions of the wave vector , the dissipation , and the density . in the low - density limit ,",
    "previous results derived from the boltzmann equation are recovered @xcite .",
    "linear stability analysis shows two transversal ( shear ) modes and a longitudinal ( `` heat '' ) mode to be unstable with respect to long wavelength excitations .",
    "the corresponding critical values for the shear and heat modes are also determined , showing that the clustering instability is mainly driven by the transversal shear mode , except for quite large dissipation . as expected ,",
    "these results agree qualitatively well with those previously derived in ref .  @xcite . on the other hand , at a quantitative level , the comparison carried out here shows significant differences between both descriptions as the collisions become more inelastic .",
