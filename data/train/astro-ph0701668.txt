    "this value shows good agreement with the @xcite line . for the medium l(h@xmath1 ) and faint l(h@xmath1 ) galaxies there was no detection of radio continuum flux , meaning that only upper limits can be determined .",
    "the @xmath40 upper limits for these regions are plotted on figure  [ halpha_rc ] . when determining these upper limits , it was assumed that the galaxies were not resolved by the gmrt synthesised beam .",
    "both of these upper limits lie just to the left of the @xcite line , suggesting that the linear relationship might not hold at low luminosities .",
    "indeed , @xcite state that there is some evidence that the h@xmath1radio continuum relationship may not be perfectly linear for galaxies with low star formation rates .",
    "they suggest that a fraction of the cosmic rays accelerated in supernovae remnants may escape from the lower mass galaxies .",

    "the reasons the remaining 33 galaxies are unusable are either : ( i )  their redshifted hi frequency lies outside the frequency range covered by the gmrt data , ( ii )  their redshift lies close to the boundary of the two sidebands where the data quality is poor , or ( iii )  their redshift lies within 5 channels of strong radio interference in the lower sideband ( this strong radio interference is at @xmath01137  mhz , covering @xmath00.625 mhz ) . for the purposes of defining a spectral window for coadding the hi signal , we allow for an average hi profile for the galaxies of the order of @xmath0300  kms@xmath22  @xcite .",
    "a velocity window width of 500  kms@xmath22  should contain all the significant hi emission after factoring in the uncertainty in the optical redshifts ( @xmath070  kms@xmath22 ) .    in our data ,",

    ", we estimate that there is only a @xmath015% chance of a direct detection ( 5@xmath44 ) of the hi flux from an individual galaxy within the volume probed by our gmrt observations .",
    "there is probably more hi mass in galaxies at z  =  0.24 than at z  @xmath0  0 , making a direct detection more likely , however detecting significant numbers of galaxies is still unlikely .",
    "for this reason we have coadded the hi signal from multiple galaxies to dramatically increase the signal to noise ratio of the measurement of the hi content of the sample .",
    "as galaxies are not individually detectable in our data , it is impossible to take into account any structure their hi gas may have when determining their hi flux density .",
    "however , the peak specific intensity of an unresolved source in a radio synthesis image is equal to the flux density of that source .",
    "this means , that if a galaxy is unresolved by the gmrt beam , we can take the value of the specific intensity at the optical position of the galaxy as a measure of the galaxy s total hi flux density .",
    "the gmrt synthesised beam has a fwhm @xmath02.9@xmath32  which corresponds to @xmath011  kpc ( 1@xmath32  corresponds to 3.8  kpc at z  =  0.24 ) .",
    "all but the smallest of the galaxies in our sample are at least partially resolved by this beam size . to solve this problem",
    "the radio data were smoothed to larger beam sizes of 5.3@xmath32  ( @xmath020  kpc ) and 8.0@xmath32  ( @xmath030  kpc ) .",
    "the larger galaxies should be unresolved in these larger beam size data .",
    "gaussian smoothing in the image plane is equivalent to tapering ( multiplying by a gaussian ) in the u - v plane .",

    "any spectral line features are included in the calculation of this linear fit across frequency .",
    "such features would create an over - estimation of the continuum , creating a bias in the measured hi spectrum . to correct for this effect",
    ", each galaxy hi spectrum has a new linear fit made across all channels except those channels corresponding to a 500  kms@xmath22  velocity width around the galaxy at its redshift ( these should be the channels that contain any hi signal ) .",
    "this new fit is then subtracted from the data , correcting for any bias created by * imlin*. this correction to the hi flux for the combined galaxy spectrum increases the measured flux by @xmath025% .    when coadding the separate hi spectra , each measured flux value carries a statistical weight that is inversely proportional to the square of its uncertainty ( the rms noise level ) .",
    "this noise value is calculated from the known rms per frequency channel in the radio data cube , factoring in the increase in the noise from the beam correction for galaxies away from the centre of the gmrt beam .",
    "as we are probing far from the gmrt beam centre , uncertainties in the beam shape could be a significant factor .",

    "this is because some galaxies lie at redshifts near the edges of the data cube and when adding the spectra of these galaxies to the total , there is no data for channels that lie off the edge of the data cube .",
    "these channels with no data are given zero weight in the coadded sum resulting in a higher noise level at these velocities in the final coadded spectrum .",
    "in figure  [ hi_double ] the total hi flux density within a central velocity width of 500  kms@xmath22  is @xmath53mjykms@xmath22 , a signal to noise ratio of 2.6 .",
    "the level of this flux is not highly dependent on the choice of the velocity width ; choosing various velocity widths from @xmath0400  to  @xmath0600  kms@xmath22  gives total fluxes that are similar within the errors .",
    "hi emission flux can be converted to the mass of atomic hydrogen that produced the signal by the following relation :    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the hi emission flux averaged across the velocity width @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the luminosity distance to the source .",
    "this equation assumes that the cloud of atomic hydrogen gas has a spin temperature well above the cosmic background temperature , that collisional excitation is the dominant process , and that the cloud is optically thin @xcite .",
    "no correction for hi self absorption has been made .",
    "hi self - absorption may cause an underestimation of the hi flux by as much as 15% .",
    "however this value is extremely uncertain @xcite . for our hi mass calculation we used @xmath58  kms@xmath22 , mean z  =  0.235 and @xmath59  mpc .",
    "this gives an average hi galaxy mass for all 121 galaxies of @xmath2  m@xmath3  ( note : m@xmath60  =  @xmath61  m@xmath3  at z  =  0 , @xcite ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the conversion of the hi mass of the galaxies to the cosmic density of neutral gas requires a measure of the number density of the galaxies .",
    "this information is available from the @xcite h@xmath1  luminosity function at z  =  0.24 .",
    "the narrow - band filter used to select the fujita galaxies is not square but has an almost gaussian - like profile ( see figure [ hist_z ] ) .",
    "this means that galaxies with strong h@xmath1  emission can be detected in the wings of the filter but will have their measured h@xmath1  luminosity underestimated .",
    "there is a strong luminosity bias in the spectroscopic redshifts we obtained due to this effect .",
    "bright galaxies that have h@xmath1  emission lines in the wings of the filter will be easier to obtain redshifts for than faint galaxies at the centre of the filter .",
    "the distribution of redshifts appears to be slightly bias towards lower redshifts .",
    "this small bias is probably caused by the [ nii]6584 emission line contributing more to the narrow - band flux at the lower redshifts , giving rise to more detections . near z  @xmath0  0.225 , the emission from the [ nii]6584 line and the [ sii ] doublet both come through simultaneously at opposite ends of the narrow - band filter .",
    "this could explain the tail at low redshift seen in the redshift distribution .",
    "@xcite applied a statistical correction for the effect of the filter shape when creating their h@xmath1  luminosity function .",
    "this could be done because they have reasonably well - understood selection criteria for h@xmath1  emission detection .",
    "this is not the case for the fujita galaxies for which we obtained redshifts .",
    "different galaxies were observed for different amounts of time , as it was not possible to configure the fibres in 2df on all the galaxy targets simultaneously .",
    "some galaxies also had small errors in their astrometry that reduced the amount of light down the optic fibre obtained for that galaxy ( these astrometric errors have since been corrected ) .",
    "this uncertainty in the detection success rate for the galaxy redshifts is why we are using the @xcite h@xmath1  luminosity function to determine the number density of the galaxies .    for calculating the number density of the galaxies ,",
    "the fujita galaxies with redshifts have been divided into three subsamples based on their h@xmath1  luminosity . in order to divide the galaxies accurately into subsamples ,",
    "it is necessary to correct the h@xmath1  luminosity for the effect of the filter shape .",
    "this is done in order to separate genuine faint galaxies from brighter galaxies seen through the wings of the narrow - band filter . without this correction ,",
    "the faintest h@xmath1  emission galaxies are measured to have more atomic hydrogen gas than galaxies with stronger h@xmath1  emission .",
    "an estimate of the necessary h@xmath1  luminosity correction can be made using the precise redshifts of the galaxies and the known shape of the narrow - band filter with wavelength .",

    "corrections can not be done for all the galaxies included in that analysis as not all have redshifts .",

    "it is necessary to convert this value of the hi gas density to the density of neutral gas .",
    "this is done by adding a correction for the neutral helium content , which is assumed to be 24% by mass of the total neutral gas .",
    "we convert this neutral gas density to units of the total cosmic mass density using :    @xmath66         after combining the neutral gas density values for each subsample we obtain a total cosmic density of neutral gas in star forming galaxies at z  =  0.24 of @xmath67 .",
    "this value is shown in comparison to other literature values in figure [ neutral_gas_redshift ] .",
    "figure [ neutral_gas_redshift ] shows the neutral gas density of the universe as a function of both redshift and look - backtime .",
    "there is a large uncertainty in the cosmic neutral gas density in the redshift range z  =  0.11.5 , which corresponds to two thirds of the age of the universe .",
    "our measured value of @xmath5 is comparable to that from previous damped ly@xmath1  measurements at intermediate redshifts @xcite . while the trend of the measurements is to indicate a sharp rise in hi content with redshift , both studies suffer from large statistical uncertainty .",
    "however , our new measurement has the advantage that it applies to a narrow range of redshifts z  @xmath0  0.24 .    strictly speaking ,",
    "our measured cosmic neutral gas density is only a lower limit , as it includes only the gas from galaxies that show star formation .",

    "no similar correction exists for the atomic hydrogen gas content of agn .",
    "however , the ratio of hi mass to h@xmath1  luminosity for agn is likely to be lower than for star forming galaxies , as agn preferentially reside in early - type galaxies @xcite . including agn in our sample",
    "may cause a small underestimation in the density of neutral gas for star forming galaxies , however it will bring our result closer to the true total cosmic neutral gas density of all galaxies by including another galaxy type in the measurement .",
    "the volume probed by @xcite for their h@xmath1  luminoisty function ( and used here for the calculation of the number density of galaxies ) is @xmath04000 mpc and is a rectangular strip with a depth @xmath0110 mpc .",
    "the cosmic variance in the number of galaxies in a field of this volume and shape at z  =  0.24 is approximately 40% .",
    "this estimate is based on a calculation using the @xcite fitting function for the matter power spectrum functon and is confirmed by an examination of the galaxy distribution in the millennium simulation at z  =  0.24 @xcite .",
    "treating this as a random error ( rather than a systematic offset ) , the final error in @xmath5 would increase by @xmath015% .",
    "however , the star formation rate measured for this field places it close to the mean , or perhaps slightly higher , compared to other values in the literature ( see section [ the_optical_data ] ) .",
    "this suggests that this field has close to the average number of galaxies despite the large possible cosmic variation , and that the measured neutral gas density measured in this field is close to , or slightly higher than , the true cosmic gas density , @xmath5 .      in the local universe",
