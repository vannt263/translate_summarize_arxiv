    "the advantage of ultracold fermi gases is the existence of highly tunable physical parameters@xcite .",

    "since correlation effects are important in high-@xmath3 cuprates@xcite , the bcs - bec crossover physics in ultracold fermi gases would be also useful for the study of this interacting electron system .",
    "in addition to the tunable interaction , one can also adjust the atomic motion by using an optical lattice@xcite .",
    "for example , when a fermi gas is loaded on a one - dimensional optical lattice , the particle motion in the the lattice direction is strongly suppressed for a very high lattice potential , which effectively realizes a two - dimensional gas .",

    "although a similar anomaly has also been observed in a three - dimensional @xmath4k fermi gas@xcite , the double peak structure observed in the former low - dimensional system is more remarkable than the latter , which indicates that the low - dimensionality enhances this anomaly .",
