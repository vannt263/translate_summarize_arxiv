    "<S> we theoretically demonstrate the quenching effect in below - threshold high harmonic generation ( hhg ) by using the time - dependent density - functional theory ( tddft ) and solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the hhg is substantially suppressed in particular harmonic orders in the below - threshold region when multi - electron interaction comes into play . </S>",
    "<S> the position of the suppression is determined by the energy gap between the highest occupied orbital and the higher - lying orbital of the target . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the quenching effect is due to a new class of multi - electron dynamics involving electron - electron energy transfer , which is analog to the fluorescence quenching owing to the energy transfer between molecules in fluorescent material . </S>",

    "<S> high harmonic generation ( hhg ) is a highly nonlinear process arising when atoms or molecules are exposed to intense femtosecond laser pulses . </S>",
    "<S> investigation on hhg has received a lot of concerns because of two fascinating applications : the generation of attosecond pulses in the extreme ultraviolet and soft x - ray region @xcite and the self - probing of atoms and molecules from the high harmonic spectrum @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the high harmonic spectroscopy allows an unprecedented combination of attosecond and ngstrm resolutions , providing a powerful tool to gain insight into the microscopic world @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> most previous works focus on the high harmonics above the ionization threshold , i.e. the harmonics with photon energy higher than the ionization potential of the target . </S>",
    "<S> recently , increasing attentions are paid to the below - threshold hhg , due to the potential application of generating extreme ultraviolet frequency combs for the precision spectroscopy and metrology @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , compared with the hhg above threshold , the process of below - threshold hhg is much more complex . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism of below - threshold hhg has been much less explored and many questions still remain debated @xcite .    moreover , in most studies on hhg , single active electron ( sae ) approximation is routinely adopted . within this approximation , </S>",
    "<S> the hhg process is understood by the behavior of the single active electron and the roles of other electrons are ignored . </S>",
    "<S> it is generally considered that the theories relying on sae approximation can well explain most of the characteristics of hhg , especially for atomic targets . for molecular systems , since the energies of different orbitals are much closer , it was shown that the contribution from lower - lying orbitals to hhg plays a nonnegligible role @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the effect of dynamical electron - electron ( @xmath0-@xmath0 ) interactions on hhg has seldom been investigated , except for only a few works @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that the collective multi - electron dynamics lead to a characteristic giant resonant enhancement of hhg near the cutoff region in the high harmonic spectrum of xe @xcite .    in this work , </S>",

    "<S> we show that this quenching effect is a result of the multi - electron interaction . </S>",

    "<S> the second electron is excited to the 4s orbital and further ionized by the laser field . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , no harmonic is generated in route 2.,width=325 ]    to reveal how the multi - electron dynamics result in the suppressions in the below - threshold region , we revisit the three - step model of hhg @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the schematic is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ schematic ] taking the target ar as an example . </S>",
    "<S> according to the three - step model , an hhg process is initialized by the ionization of electrons in the highest occupied orbital , i.e. the 3p orbital ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ schematic](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the electrons are then accelerated by the laser field and finally return to the core . </S>",
    "<S> now we consider the return electron with the energy equal to that of the 4s orbital . in the recombination step </S>",
    "<S> , this electron may recombine to the 3p orbital and release the accumulated energy in two routes . in route 1 , it releases the energy by emitting a photon . </S>",
    "<S> this is the typical hhg process , where high harmonic emission with photon energy equal to the energy gap between 3p and 4s orbitals @xmath36 is obtained ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ schematic](b ) ) . in route 2 , the considered electron returns to the ground state without emitting a harmonic photon . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , it transfers the energy to another electron ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the second electron is excited to the 4s orbital and further ionized by the laser field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the total amount of return electrons is constant . </S>",
    "<S> since a portion of the electrons recombine via route 2 , the number of electrons recombining via route 1 is decreased . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the harmonics emitted via route 1 ( photon energy @xmath37 ) are suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> this suppression effect is analog to the fluorescence quenching owing to the energy transfer between molecules in fluorescent materials . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore call it the quenching effect in hhg . to our knowledge , </S>",
    "<S> such a quenching effect in hhg has never been addressed before .    </S>",
    "<S> the suppression for the quenched harmonics depends on the probabilities of the radiative recombination ( route 1 ) and the non - radiative recombination ( route 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the higher the probability of route 2 is , the more the harmonics will be suppressed . as route 2 </S>",
    "<S> is a resonant process , the probability of route 2 can be much higher than that of route 1 , and thus the quenched harmonics can be suppressed by a few orders of magnitudes . </S>",
    "<S> besides , the suppression also depends on the ionization rate of the higher - lying orbital . </S>",
    "<S> the ionization rate of the higher orbital should be larger than the rate of radiative transition back to the ground orbital . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , the second electron may return to the ground state via radiative transition , and then the quenching effect will be eliminated . </S>",
    "<S> one may even expect a resonant enhancement of hhg @xcite if the ionization rate is much smaller than the radiative transition rate .    </S>",
    "<S> the crucial process for the quenching effect is the energy transfer when the first electron returns to the core . to verify this process </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the observable quantity of ellipticity dependence of hhg . </S>",
    "<S> the hhg efficiency decreases with the increase of laser ellipticity , because the ionized electron will drift in the transverses direction and fail to return to the core @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the probability of the @xmath0-@xmath0 energy transfer process in route 2 decreases and thus the quenching effect will vanish with the increase of the ellipticity . </S>",
    "<S> based on this effect , it is expected that the intensities of the quenched harmonics will decrease more slowly ( even increase ) with the increase of ellipticity .     </S>",

    "<S> the ratios increase with the ellipticity . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the suppression at the 7th harmonic becomes weaker with the increase of the ellipticity </S>",

    "<S> anomalous ellipticity dependence at the quenched 7th harmonic is found in both figs . [ ellipticity](c ) and ( d ) : the intensities of the 7th harmonics increase first when the ellipticity is moderate and then drop with the increase of ellipticity , while the intensities of other harmonics decrease with the increase of ellipticity as normal . comparing figs . </S>",
