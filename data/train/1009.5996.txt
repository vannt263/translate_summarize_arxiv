    "in many scenarios of physics beyond the standard model , the associated signatures are observable only in high energy interactions , motivating the use of particle accelerators such as the large hadron collider and the tevatron . in other cases , however , the effects of new physics can appear over very long periods of time , or in very long baseline experiments .",
    "the discovery of neutrino flavor oscillations provide such an example .",
    "neutrino oscillations have only been observed among neutrinos propagating between the sun and earth and over shorter distances , however , leaving open the possibility that other new phenomena might become observable through the study of neutrinos traveling over much greater distances  @xcite .    a wide variety of distant astrophysical objects",
    "are predicted to potentially produce observable fluxes of neutrinos , including active galactic nuclei , gamma ray bursts , microquasars , x - ray binaries , and supernovae  @xcite . among these prospective sources , however , only neutrinos from supernovae have been observed . in particular , a total of 24 ( likely anti - electron )",
    "neutrinos were detected by three different detectors in the seconds following supernova 1987a . at a distance of approximately 50 kiloparsecs from earth ,",
    "sn 1987a provided an opportunity to observe neutrinos over a baseline that is roughly @xmath1 times longer than that traveled by solar neutrinos .",
    "when the next nearby supernova takes place , modern detectors will observe far more events and collect a much greater range of information than was possible in 1987 .    in this article",
    ", we discuss the possibility of using neutrinos from a galactic supernova as a probe of exotic physics .",
    "in particular , we focus on two examples of phenomena that are observable only over long baselines or timescale : neutrino decay and quantum decoherence .",
    "the remainder of this article is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ physics ] , we summarize the exotic physics scenarios considered in our study . in sec .",
    "[ sec : initialflux ] , we discuss the predicted neutrino spectrum from supernova and in sec .  [ detect ] we describe the experiments used to detect them . in sec .",
    "[ results ] , we describe how neutrino decay or quantum decoherence would impact the neutrinos observed from a galactic supernova and discuss how such observations could be used to constrain or identify such phenomena . in sec .",
    "[ neutronization ] , we discuss the role that neutrinos from a supernova s neutronization burst can play in identifying or constraining new physics . finally , in sec .  [ conclusions ] , we summarize our results and conclusions .",
    "in this study , we focus on two body decays of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote either neutrino or anti - neutrino mass eigenstates and @xmath5 represents a very light or massless particle ( such as a majoran ) that is not detected ( for related model building , see ref .",
    "in contrast to radiative decays  @xcite , decays of this form are viable over supernova - scale baselines . the strongest constraints on decays of this type are on the order of @xmath6s / ev , and result from solar neutrino data  @xcite and from searches for the appearance of @xmath7 at kamland  @xcite .",
    "in some cases , constraints can also be placed from the observations of sn 1987a .",
    "the 24 neutrino events associated with sn 1987a marked the first ( and thus far only ) detection of neutrinos from a supernova .",
    "although the modest number of detected events limit the utility of any extensive statistical analysis , some general features have been confirmed .",
    "specifically , the number of events detected from sn 1987a agree well with expectations . from this",
    ", we can conclude that @xmath7 s do not significantly decay , at least over timescales of less than @xmath8years , which limits the corresponding rest - frame lifetime to @xmath9 .",
    "the constraints from sn 1987a are most relevant for the case of an inverted mass hierarchy , in which @xmath10 is the lightest mass eigenstate and , due to the small value of @xmath11 , has a very small projection onto @xmath12 . even if @xmath11 is taken to have the largest experimentally allowed value , the decay scenario where both @xmath13 and @xmath14 leads to about a factor of 10 suppression in the number of expected events . as this suppression",
    "was not observed in sn 1987a , we can conclude that the timescale for this process ( for @xmath15 mev ) must also be at least @xmath8years .",
    "the baseline to the large magellanic cloud ( where 1987a occurred ) is extremely long at approximately 50  kpc . as this study",
    "is focused on galactic supernova with a baseline of roughly 10  kpc , this scenario of neutrino decay can be excluded from our analysis . within the context of the normal hierarchy ,",
    "however , sn 1987a does not strongly constrain the possibility of decays of one neutrino mass eigenstate to another .    in the decay of a neutrino , helicity",
    "can either be conserved or flipped .",
    "if the masses are quasi - degenerate ( @xmath16 ) , then the conserved helicity decay is strongly favored . in this case , the daughter neutrino receives nearly all of the parent s energy , and the overall spectrum is left nearly unchanged .",
    "if the masses are instead hierarchical ( @xmath17 ) , then a larger fraction of the parent energy can be lost to the @xmath5 particle , leading to a degraded spectrum of the daughter species relative to that of the parent .",
    "the details of the resulting spectrum further depend on whether the neutrinos are majorana or dirac particles .",
    "if the neutrinos are majorana particles , then the daughters with flipped helicity will be detectable as a corresponding anti - neutrino . with the parent ( daughter ) energy labeled as @xmath18",
    ", the daughter spectrum will be scaled down by a factor of @xmath19 relative to that of the parent  @xcite . the daughters with conserved helicity",
    "will also have a spectrum found by scaling that of the parent , but this time by a factor of @xmath20  @xcite . if the neutrinos are dirac particles , then the daughter neutrinos with flipped helicity will be sterile and thus undetectable .",
    "the daughters with conserved helicity will again have a spectrum produced by scaling the parent spectrum by a factor of @xmath20 .",
    "thus in such a decay scenario , not only will the energy spectrum be degraded , but also the total number of neutrinos / anti - neutrinos will be suppressed .      within the context of standard quantum mechanics , a pure state will indefinitely remain in that state , never oscillating into a superposition or mixture of states .",
    "it has been suggested , however , that quantum fluctuations of the gravitational field could potentially alter this conclusion .",
    "short lived microscopic black holes , for example , could appear as part of the space time foam , leading to the loss of quantum information as particles move across their event horizons , and transforming pure states into a mixed ones  @xcite .    among neutrinos , one might hope to observe quantum decoherence through the loss of flavor information taking place over very long baselines  @xcite .",
    "the prediction for this phenomenon is the evolution of neutrino flavors toward a ratio of @xmath21 , for both neutrinos and anti - neutrinos , regardless of their initial conditions .",
    "if this evolution takes place over kiloparsec distance scales , it may be possible to observe with the next galactic supernova .",
    "over a period of approximately 10 seconds , a supernova produces approximately as many neutrinos as the sun will generate over its entire life .",
    "approximately 99% of the gravitational energy associated with a stellar core - collapse supernova is released in the form neutrinos .    despite considerable effort spanning several decades in the modeling of core - collapse supernovae , there are still many aspects of the explosion that are not well understood . in 1998 ,",
    "the livermoore group produced the most recent simulation that obtained an explosion and followed the evolution through 18  s @xcite .",
    "the model predicts strongly hierarchical time - integrated , average energies : @xmath22@xmath2312  mev , @xmath24@xmath2315  mev , and @xmath25@xmath2324  mev , where @xmath26 denotes @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "this strong hierarchy is useful for distinguishing between different oscillation and decay scenarios , as there are several important neutrino interactions involving @xmath12 and @xmath7 with relatively high energy thresholds that would not produce many events without significant mixing from the harder @xmath26 spectra .",
    "the livermoore group also found luminosity and total energy equipartition between the flavors throughout the evolution .",
    "the time integrated neutrino spectrum is often written as a `` pinched '' fermi - dirac distribution :    @xmath31    with @xmath32 the energy of the neutrinos , @xmath33 an overall normalization constant , @xmath34 the neutrino temperature , and @xmath35 is a chemical potential for the neutrinos . for this spectrum , @xmath35 is a measure of how pinched the low energy and high energy tails would be when compared to a fermi - dirac spectrum with the same average energy .",
    "the parameters that we use in our model are chosen to match well with the spectra of the livermore model , with @xmath36mev , @xmath37mev , @xmath38mev , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41  @xcite .",

    "more recent simulations which account for these processes fail to produce an explosion and only follow the supernova evolution for a maximum of @xmath421  s ( see table iii of ref .",
    "@xcite for references to many of these models ) . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , luminosity equipartition between @xmath12 and @xmath7 seems to hold for most models , but @xmath26 luminosity can vary by a factor of 2 in either direction depending on the model and evolutionary phase of the supernova . additionally , most of these models produce a somewhat less pronounced energy hierarchy than that found in the livermoore model .",
    "for example , the garching group reports @xmath43  mev , @xmath44  mev , and @xmath45  mev @xcite .",
    "in this section , we summarize the primary detection techniques used to potentially detect the neutrinos from a nearby supernova .",
    "when charged particles such as electrons travel faster than the local speed of light , they emit radiation which can be detected . currently , the largest water cerenkov detector is super kamiokande .",
    "the signal from an individual supernova is a short lived event ( @xmath4210  s ) , which permits higher background rates , allowing super kamiokande to use its full fiducial mass of 32  kilo - tons ( kton ) , significantly larger than any other existing neutrino detector , although detectors at the 500  kton scale have been proposed ( uno @xcite , memphys @xcite , and hyper - kamiokande @xcite ) . the interactions relevant for the observation of supernova neutrinos by water cerenkov detectors include :      for any target material with a large number of free protons ( those not bound in a nucleus ) , inverse beta decay events will typically dominate the signal .",
    "this is due in large part to the relatively large cross section and the low energy threshold ( @xmath421.8  mev ) .",
    "this reaction has been studied extensively both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "we use the cross section from ref .",
    "@xcite which includes radiative corrections and an exact treatment of the kinematics .",
    "a proposal has been made to dissolve approximately 0.2% gadolinium within the water of super kamiokande with the purpose of tagging the neutrons produced by inverse beta decay @xcite .",
    "these neutrons quickly thermalize and are captured on the gadolinium nucleus with a 90% efficiency , producing a cascade of detectable photons @xcite .",
    "although all flavors of neutrinos can undergo the process of elastic scattering with electrons , the cross sections vary for the different flavors . this can be traced to the fact that for electron neutrinos both charged current and neutral current processes contribute to the cross sections .",
    "supernova neutrinos have energies far below the mass of the muon , so only the neutral current process contributes to the cross section for @xmath26 .",
    "the approximate ratios of the total cross sections are @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "although there are copious numbers of electrons in any target material , the cross section is typically much smaller than for interactions with protons or neutrons , causing the total event rate to be dominated by nuclear scattering .",
    "electron scattering events are strongly forward peaked ( due to the small electron mass ) , however , providing a means by which to separate these events from the large rate of inverse beta decay .",
    "if the two signals can indeed be separated then this process could provide an opportunity to measure the @xmath12 component of the neutrino spectrum .",
    "supernova neutrinos can also interact with oxygen nuclei in water cerenkov detectors .",
    "both @xmath12 and @xmath7 undergo charge current interactions with oxygen nuclei and have thresholds of 15.4  mev and 11.4  mev , respectively .",
    "the signals from the resulting positrons and electrons are indistinguishable from each other and from inverse beta decay positrons in super kamiokande , so these reactions can not be uniquely identified . additionally , the high thresholds mean that unless the harder @xmath26 spectra mixes significantly with the @xmath12 and @xmath7 ( through oscillations or other exotic physics ) , the oxygen charged current signal will be quite low .    all neutrino flavors can undergo neutral current reactions with oxygen nuclei , which can yield detectable @xmath57 and @xmath58 particles in the subsequent decays of the excited nucleus .",
    "the most interesting of these decay chains involve excited states of @xmath59o and @xmath59n .",
    "these states are only able to decay through the emission of a @xmath58 with an energy in the range of 5  mev to 10  mev and are detectable as peaks above the smooth background ( see figure 2 of ref .",
    "this oxygen reaction was suggested as a supernova neutrino signal in ref .",
    "@xcite , where they estimated 300 oxygen events over a smooth background of roughly 270 inverse beta decay events in this energy window .",
    "scintillating detectors generally contain an organic oil that is composed primarily of carbon and hydrogen .",
    "currently , kamland and lvd are the largest scintillating detectors with a mass on the order of 1  kton  @xcite .",
    "although these detectors are much smaller than super kamiokande , scintillators typically have much lower energy thresholds and higher light output allowing them to compete with super kamiokande in certain arenas .",
    "proposals for larger scintillators include lena ( 50  kton ) @xcite and hanohano ( 10 kton ) @xcite .",
    "as scintillators contain many free protons , inverse beta decay provides a strong supernova signal in these detectors .",
    "these events can be tagged in scintillating detectors as the positron produced annihilates with an electron producing a pair of photons that are above the energy detection threshold .",
    "additionally , there will be a delayed coincidence signal from a 2.2  mev photon produced when the neutron captures onto a proton producing deuterium . as with water cerenkov detectors , electron elastic scattering provides a much smaller signal .",
    "we will now briefly describe the other important interactions for scintillators .      at supernova neutrino energies ,",
    "both @xmath12 and @xmath7 can undergo charged current reactions .",
    "the @xmath12 reaction has a threshold of 17.3  mev and produces @xmath63n which subsequently decays by emitting a @xmath64 with a mean lifetime of 11.0  ms @xcite .",
    "the emitted positron annihilates producing a gamma ray pair that give a delayed coincidence signal for tagging these events .",
    "similarly , the @xmath7 reaction has threshold of 14.4  mev and produces two photons from the emitted positron annihilation .",
    "also , the @xmath63b produced in the reaction decays by emitting an electron with a mean lifetime of 20.2  ms , providing an additional coincidence signal @xcite . with such high thresholds , these reactions depend critically on any mixing from the higher energy @xmath26 spectra .",
    "neutrinos with energies above the 15.11  mev threshold can excite @xmath63c into a state that decays through emission of a distinctive 15.11  mev , mono - energetic photon .",
    "this signal will convey no spectral information about the neutrinos since all interactions produce the same mono - energetic photon .",
    "this process is neutral current so all flavors contribute equally to the cross section . once again , the high threshold limits the interactions to mainly higher energy neutrinos . we have taken the cross section for these reactions from ref .  @xcite .",
    "the cross section for this process is fairly large and all flavors contribute almost equally .",
    "despite the fact that the scattered protons will undergo a significant amount of quenching due to ionization , this process can still produce a large signal for a supernova @xcite .",
    "although the proton elastic scattering would provide additional statistics , we will only use the 15.11  mev carbon peak for our neutral current signal .",
    "this is because extracting the peak from the smooth background should be quite easy , while separating the proton elastic scattering from the other signals would prove more challenging .",
    "icarus is currently the largest liquid argon detector with a mass of 600  tons , and is planned to be scaled up to 3  kton  @xcite . in icarus ,",
    "ionization electrons from liquid argon are detected as they travel along a uniform electric field , providing accurate 3-dimensional event tracking and energy reconstruction @xcite .",
    "one of the most attractive features of liquid argon detectors is a strong sensitivity to @xmath12 because of the relatively large cross section and low energy threshold .",
    "an additional benefit is that the charged current and neutral current reactions can all be distinguished by gamma emission from the excited nuclei . with electron elastic scattering events producing no coincident photons , all four of the primary reactions",
    "can be separated , in principle .",

    "@xmath85 is the ratio of total continuum events above 20  mev to the total continuum events below 20  mev .",
    "again , the error bars represent the @xmath87 statistical uncertainties.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=74.0% ] +    as in the case of water cerenkov detectors , if the neutrino mass hierarchy is inverted , oscillations complicate the situation .",
    "in fact , even the next generation scintillating detectors in the 50  kton mass range are not well equipped to distinguish the decay scenarios for the inverted mass hierarchy . as discussed in the previous section , neutrino oscillations play the largest role in determining the signals in the anti - neutrino sector .",
    "oscillations play a much more minor role in the neutrino sector providing the hope that the neutrino flux might provide the ability to separate the decay scenarios .",
    "unfortunately , the charged - current reactions of @xmath12 on carbon nuclei has a very high energy threshold of 17.3  mev , and in the inverted hierarchy , @xmath83 will have the softest spectrum .",
    "this means that any scenario in which @xmath83 decays will have only minor affects on the ratios .",
    "we also consider the possibility of using electron elastic scattering in the same manner as was done for super kamiokande .",
    "this is not practical , however , because electron elastic scattering requires detectors on the order of 500  kton to effectively separate the scenarios ( see fig .",

    "the charged current reactions on carbon would virtually disappear because nearly all of the high energy neutrinos will be @xmath10 , which has a very small projection onto @xmath12 .",
    "both water cerenkov and scintillating detectors are much more sensitive to @xmath7 , providing good separation ability between decay scenarios in the normal mass hierarchy .",
    "this is because the anti - neutrino sector is best for isolating the decay differences from oscillation effects in the normal mass hierarchy .",
    "the true strength of a liquid argon detector is realized in the inverted mass hierarchy . in this case , the neutrino sector provides the best opportunity for isolating decay effects . the low energy threshold ( 2.8  mev ) for charged - current neutrino reactions with argon nuclei",

    "this is another huge benefit for liquid argon over the other types of detectors .",

    "notice that the quantum decoherence point is coincidentally indistinguishable from the no decay scenario.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=74.0% ] +    the threshold for anti - neutrino charged current reactions on argon nuclei is not particularly large at 7.5  mev .",
    "however , the much lower threshold of 1.8  mev for inverse beta decay ensures that both water cerenkov and scintillating detectors of similar size will have better separation sensitivity in the normal mass hierarchy .",
    "we have calculated the results in the normal mass hierarchy ( not shown ) for the next generation liquid argon detectors and found similar scenario separation to that of super kamiokande ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : superkplotnorm ] ) .",
    "all of the results that we have presented thus far are dependent upon the strong hierarchy of initial average energies within the livermoore model .",
    "we also calculated similar results to those presented above using the the softer @xmath26 spectrum of the garching model .",
    "although the statistical uncertainties are increased , we still found that the detectors were able to separate the scenarios .",
    "however , the values of the corresponding ratios between the two models do not match well .",
    "if a particular model emerges as the accepted one among the community , then our calculations could very easily be modified to the accepted model .",
    "one way to avoid model dependent conclusions is by focusing on the neutronization burst from the supernova as discussed in the following section .",
    "at the onset of instability , the core begins to collapse , significantly increasing in density .",
    "once the density of the inner core reaches that of nuclear matter of order ( @xmath98 g  @xmath99 ) , the core bounces , producing an outgoing shock wave .",
    "the shock wave travels towards the outer layers of the stellar core , losing energy through the photodissociation of nuclei .",
    "the newly created free protons have a large electron capture rate , which leads them to neutronize through the process @xmath100 , resulting in a large flux of @xmath12 .",
    "these neutrinos are initially trapped behind the shock wave , as the density of the core is too high .",
    "once the shock wave has traveled outwards to the region of the neutrinosphere ( @xmath101 g  @xmath99 ) , however , the neutrinos rapidly escape in what is often termed the neutronization burst .",
    "the presence and structure of the neutronization peak is one of the most robust features of supernova models . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors show that several different models using many different progenitor stars produce very similar peaks . additionally , the authors examined the dependence of the signal in a megaton water cerenkov detector on several important astrophysical inputs .",
    "they found that differences in the progenitor mass , three possible models for nuclear equation of state for the core , and possible improvements to interaction cross sections all led to changes in event numbers that were small compared to the statistical fluctuations .",
    "the robustness of the neutronization peak across many models provides the opportunity for examining exotic physics scenarios without relying on the details of the underlying supernova model .",
    "one limitation of using the neutronizaton burst peak , however , is that the signal is not particularly bright .",
    "the neutronization peak typically has a full width half maximum of 5 - 7  ms and a peak luminosity of @xmath102erg s@xmath103 @xcite .",
    "the total energy released is @xmath42@xmath104erg , compared to the much larger @xmath42@xmath105erg of energy in @xmath12 for the entire supernova . as a consequence",
    ", very large volume detectors will be required to discriminate between the various exotic physics scenarios being considered here .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors examine neutrino decay ( for three different decay scenarios ) in the case of the normal mass hierarchy with hierarchical masses , in which the neutronization peak can be identified in the inverse beta decay signal in a future water cerenkov detector .",
    "similarly , we also find that future planned detectors will possess the ability to clearly separate between our exotic physics scenarios when focusing only on the neutronization burst . in fig .",
    "[ fig : neutronization ] , we plot the same ratios as in the previous sections , but for the neutronization signal only .",
