    "an inevitable feature of exact solutions in general relativity under different general physical conditions is the occurrence of singularities . whether such singularities will always be covered ( by the event horizon ) to distant observers or not is an interesting unresolved question .",
    "the _ cosmic censorship _ conjecture [ 1 ] prevents the development of a naked singularity generically in realistic gravitational collapse . however , the question of cosmic censorship is still open due to lack of any rigorous proof of the conjecture .    if naked singularities exist in nature as real astrophysical objects it is worthwhile to explore whether or not the naked singularities give different observational predictions than those due to black holes ( bhs ) which could be utilized to discriminate these two objects observationally",
    ". gravitational lensing by naked singularities , particularly in strong field regime , is found to have some interesting characteristics difference from those by bhs [ 2 ] .",
    "the time delay between successive relativistic images in gravitational lensing also exhibit different behavior for naked singularity and bh lens .",
    "even the time delays of relativistic images are found negative for strongly naked singularity solution [ 3 ] .",
    "the fluxes of escaping particles produced in ultra high energy collision of particles in the vicinity of a naked singularity also bear the characteristics of naked singularity [ 4 ] .",
    "the properties of stable circular orbits around naked singularity solution are significantly different than those around a schwarzschild bh with the same mass and thus the accretion disk around the naked singularity could be observationally distinguished from that around a bh [ 5 ] .",
    "it has long been argued innumerable times in the literature about the necessity of using pseudo - newtonian potentials ( pnps ) [ 6 - 8 ] to study complex accretion phenomena around bhs / compact object , ever since the seminal work of paczyski and witta [ 9 ] .",
    "series of pnps or newtonian like analogous potentials of the corresponding relativistic geometries till date exist in the literature [ 6 - 20 ] which , however , are mostly proposed for corresponding bh solutions . in this work",
    "we construct pnps for the naked singularity solutions , corresponding to two ` static non vacuum solutions ' to einstein s field equations : the janis - newman - winicour ( jnw ) metric [ 21 ] which is an exact solution of gr field equations in presence of a minimally coupled massless scalar field exhibiting naked singularity and the reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) solution , which is the well known unique asymptotically flat solution of the einstein - maxwell equations describing a charged nonrotating metric that also exhibits naked singularity for certain choices of solution parameters .",
    "we formulate the corresponding pnps proceeding directly from the conserved hamiltonian of the system following [ 20,7,8 ] .",
    "we refer these pnps as newtonian like analogous potentials ( nap ) .",
    "note that nap for the rn geometry could also be obtained from a generic expression given in [ 22 ] but the formulation could not be applicable to jnw spacetime . therefore we first deduce a proper potential analogue in the newtonian framework corresponding to a most generalized form of static gr spacetime which is therefore applicable to jnw metric .",
    "we study the complete orbital dynamics of the test particle motion exploiting naps for jnw and rn geometries and compare them with the results for the schwarzschild geometry as well as among themselves .",
    "we also study extensively the general orbital trajectory profiles for both these geometries , in the modified newtonian analogue .",
    "apart from the use of these potentials to investigate the dynamical nature of accretion flows , the newtonian analogous potentials could be comprehensively used for generic astrophysical purposes relevant to jnw and rn geometries . in recent times",
    ", some properties of the circular orbit dynamics of test particle motion have been investigated in both jnw and rn spacetimes [ 23,24,25 ] in gr framework which can be reproduced employing relevant naps .    in the next section ,",

    "the general relativity so far has been tested in solar system measurements as well as by accurate radio observations of binary pulsars . however , in all such cases , the gravitational field is weak and it appears from the detailed studies over the last few decades that naked singularities can not be discriminated from black holes from weak field observations ; one has to look for strong field tests instead .",
    "the characteristics of the radiation emitted from the accretion disk are supposed to provide useful details about the spacetime geometry around the compact object .",
    "we studied a very simple accretion model exploiting newtonian like analogous potential of the corresponding naked singularity geometries . the very premise with which the newtonian like analogous potential of the corresponding static gr geometries have been derived in the present work ensures reproduction of identical or near identical geodesic equations of motion .",
    "not only the orbits like marginally stable or marginally bound are exactly reproduced , dynamical profiles like conserved angular momentum , conserved energy , the temporal features like angular and epicyclic frequencies are reproduced with precise accuracy .",
    "most importantly , the adopted method guarantees the replication of the orbital trajectory of test particle motion accurately , consequently , reproducing the experimentally tested gr effects like perihelion advancement , gravitational bending of light or gravitational time delay with precise accuracy .",
    "the generality of the procedure then ensures that not only static gr geometries with event horizons can be comprehensively mimicked through this kind of potential ; gr features corresponding to naked singularities can also be reproduced comprehensively with precise accuracy and can be used to analyze relevant astrophysical processes in strong field gravity around corresponding naked singularities .",
    "it is found from the present analysis that accretion disk properties around naked singularities show clear notable differences , with geometrically thin keplerian disk more luminous than that around equivalent bhs . out of the two possible locations of @xmath189 and @xmath190 for certain range in the values of @xmath37 and",
    "@xmath136 corresponding to naked singularity solutions , the inner edge of the keplerian accretion disk around a naked singularity would be located at @xmath191 .",
    "however , gaseous particles reaching @xmath191 would then simply plunge either to reach the singularity or @xmath192 where stable circular orbits occur .",
    "nonetheless , for non - keplerian accretion flow around a naked singularity , this inner region ( @xmath193 ) may become very important where the dynamical behavior of the accretion disk may be significantly different than that around equivalent bh solutions , consequently the corresponding spectrum from the accretion flow around a naked singularity may show certain distinctive features as compared to the similar accretion flow around bh solutions .",
    "thus x - ray binaries or active galactic nuclei would be the most likely regions where distinguishable differences in the observational features between bhs and naked singularities , can , in principle , be made .",
    "an important point is that , whether the derived potentials contain the naked singularity features of the concerned spacetime geometries .",
    "let us first consider the case of jnw solution .",
    "the ricci , the kretschmann , and the weyl scalars for the jnw are known to diverge at singularities .",
    "the derived modified newtonian analogous potential corresponding to jnw metric is also found to diverge at @xmath194 but the radial velocity remains finite as follows from the eq .",
    "( 16 ) and radial infall to the singularity is admissible .",
    "being a globally naked singularity solution , there exists a future directed causal curve with one end on the singularity and the other end on future null infinity for the jnw geometry in the gr treatment .",
    "after recovering test particle mass ( m ) , for radial motion the eq .",
    "( 16 ) reads @xmath195 which for photons ( @xmath196 ) becomes @xmath197 [ where @xmath198 , the constant of motion for test particle of mass @xmath6 is the conserved energy ( not the specific energy ) , and @xmath199 is the equivalent term corresponding to photon ] .",
    "therefore we get the same expression of radial velocity as given by the gr treatment in the low energy limit . for an observer at a finite distance r",
    ", the solution of outgoing null geodesic from the singularity is @xmath200 which is finite for @xmath201 , where @xmath12 is a small perturbation along radial distance @xmath147 .",
    "hence the modified newtonian analogous potential corresponding to jnw metric admits outgoing null geodesic from the singularity ( i.e. the singularity is visible to external observers ) and thus the derived potential contains the globally naked singularity features of the original spacetime .",
    "the same argument can be extended for the rn case with @xmath118 .",
    "in this work , we have formulated a generic newtonian like analogous potential corresponding to static spherically symmetric general gr spacetime , and subsequently derived proper newtonian like analogous potential for jnw and rn spacetimes .",
    "the derived pnps found to reproduce the entire gr features with precise accuracy .",
    "we also studied orbital dynamics around these two geometries extensively in the modified newtonian analogue , including the detailed analysis of their corresponding test particle trajectories .",
    "our findings employing the modified newtonian analogous potentials for the naked singularity solutions show that as one departs more from schwarzschild solution i.e. with the increase in the value of @xmath37 and @xmath136 , the nature of the test particle dynamics along circular orbit in jnw and rn spacetimes tends to show altogether different behavior with distinctive traits as compared to the nature of particle dynamics in the schwarzschild geometry .",
    "interestingly we found two values of @xmath102 for a certain range in the value of @xmath37 ( @xmath82 ) and @xmath136 ( @xmath202 ) , which are unique features of jnw and rn geometries .",
    "for values of @xmath203 and @xmath151 , the particle in circular trajectory would not have last stable orbit , consequently if the particle motion is perturbed in the inner region corresponding to jnw and rn geometries with these values of @xmath37 and @xmath136 , the particle would eventually plunge into the naked singularities .",
    "the magnitude of the apsidal precession in the jnw geometry increases continuously as one departs more from the schwarzschild bh solution , irrespective of the orbital parameters up to the value of @xmath167 , beyond which , the particle trajectory does not produce well defined orbits . on the contrary , for the rn geometry , the magnitude of the apsidal precession decreases as one departs from the schwarzschild bh solution , however beyond a certain value of @xmath136 depending on the orbital parameters , the magnitude of the apsidal precession increases , with the particle orbit showing retrograde precession . for particular value of @xmath136 ( @xmath169 ) in rn geometry ,",
    "the value of apsidal precession becomes almost independent of orbital parameters for the elliptical orbits .",
    "if the test particle starts from a fixed source with a fixed initial velocity irrespective of the location of the source and magnitude of the initial velocity , as one departs more from the schwarzschild bh solution , the bending angle of particle s parabolic like orbital trajectory in jnw geometry steadily decreases , even attaining less value then that of the newtonian case , while there is a steady increase in the the bending angle in rn geometry . on the contrary , if the test particle starts with different initial velocity corresponding to different values of @xmath37 or @xmath136 from a fixed source to reach the fixed location of the observer , as one departs more from the schwarzschild bh solution , the bending angle of particle s parabolic like orbital trajectory along with the total time taken by the particle to reach the observer corresponding to jnw geometry increases , in contrast to the case in rn geometry where the bending angle as well as the time taken by the particle to reach the observer steadily decreases , even becoming less as compared to that of the newtonian case .",
    "one can then infer that the gravitational bending of light would also show similar kind of behavior in the presence of these geometries having naked singularities .",
    "we applied the newtonian like analogous potentials to model a simple geometrically thin and optically thick keplerian accretion disk in the presence of jnw and rn geometries .",
    "we found that the radiative efficiencies of keplerian accretion disk around both jnw and rn naked singularities are always higher than that around schwarzschild geometry .",
    "although our analysis has been performed for a simplistic geometrically thin keplerian accretion disk , however , the nature of the variation of the radiative efficiency with @xmath37 or @xmath136 for jnw and rn geometries , likely to be remain similar even for complex accretion flow processes in the presence of these geometries .",
    "more extensive study of accretion flow processes including the detailed modeling of geometrically thick and/or advective accretion flow in these geometries would be pursued in a later work .",
    "the accreting system in the strong field regime , thus , appears to provide a natural laboratory to ascertain the presence of either naked singularities or bhs .",
    "here it is worthwhile to mention that in reality bhs probably have almost no electric charge because a charged bh is expected to quickly neutralize by attracting charge of the opposite sign [ 29 ] .",
    "hence rn bhs / naked singularities might not have much astrophysical relevance . on the other hand price theorem [ 30 ]",
    "suggests that the asymptotically flat scalar fields around a bh should radiate away quickly leaving only its constant asymptotic value and the schwarzschild bh , thereby raising doubt on the physical reality of the jnw spacetime .",
    "however , the price theorem is not strictly applicable to jnw metric as the metric has no horizon and the scalar field diverges at curvature singularity [ 31 ] . here",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that there are several claims in the literature for formation of naked singularity in generic gravitationally spherical collapse of an inhomogeneous dust ball but whether the jnw solution will occur in a generic gravitational collapse is not known yet",
    ". it would be interesting if the present approach can be extended to the recently found stationary bh solutions with long - lived ( complex ) scalar field [ 32 ] to study the influence of scalar field in accretion related phenomena .",
