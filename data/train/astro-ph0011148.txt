    "over the years , the typical magnitudes of the surface magnetic fields of pulsars  as inferred from measured spindown rates and simple magnetic dipole models  have been @xmath5 g @xcite .",
    "assuming magnetic flux conservation , fields of @xmath6 g would naturally arise from typical main sequence star surface magnetic fields of @xmath7 g during a decrease in radius by a factor of @xmath8 @xcite . at the extreme end of fields attainable by flux conservation ,",
    "the largerst observed white dwarf magnetic field of @xmath9 g leads to a neutron star field of @xmath10 g @xcite , while the largest observed main sequence stellar magnetic field of @xmath11  g @xcite also suggests a possible field of a few times @xmath12",
    "g.    several independent circumstantial arguments link the class of objects known as `` soft @xmath13-ray repeaters '' ( sgrs ) , and perhaps the so - called `` anomalous x - ray pulsars '' ( axps ) , with neutron stars having magnetic fields @xmath14 g  the so - called `` magnetars '' @xcite .",
    "( table [ tbl-0 ] displays some observed properties of these objects . ) in addition to the circumstantial arguments , more direct evidence for magnetic fields of @xmath15 g is available for two of the five known sgrs , in the form of measured periods and spindown rates of associated x - ray pulsars @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the observed x - ray luminosities of the axps may require a field strength @xmath16",
    "the population statistics of sgrs suggest that magnetars may constitute a significant fraction ( @xmath17 ) of the neutron star population @xcite . as mentioned above , there are isolated examples of progenitor stars which could yield fields of @xmath18 g by flux conservation , but these isolated examples do not seem sufficient to account for a significant fraction of the neutron star population .",
    "thus , it seems likely that some mechanism _ generates _ magnetic fields in nascent neutron stars .",
    "for example , @xcite suggest that the smoothing out of differential rotation and convection could generate fields as large as @xmath19 g , where @xmath20 is the initial rotation period of the neutron star .",
    "these considerations motivate study of the effects of ultra - strong magnetic fields on neutron star properties . in this",
    "we have been inspired by the pioneering work of bocquet , bonazzola , gourgoulhon & novak ( 1995 ) , who performed relativistic calculations of axisymmetric neutron star structure in which the standard stress - energy tensors of a perfect fluid and the electromagnetic field were employed , and were comparable in magnitude .",
    "the maximum fields they found were of order @xmath21 g , with increases of 13 to 29% in the maximum mass of nonrotating stars for various equations of state .",
    "an additional motivation is provided by the recent findings that magnetic fields of strengths larger than @xmath22 g affect the eos of dense matter directly through drastic changes in the composition of matter @xcite .",
    "the eos is altered by both the landau quantization of the charged particles ( such as protons , electrons , etc . ) and the interactions of the magnetic moments , including the anomalous magentic moments of the neutral particles ( such as the neutron , strangeness - bearing @xmath23-hyperon etc . ) with the magnetic field . in this work , we consider only the effects of the magnetic field on the structure , through its influence on the metric , in order to facilitate a comparison with the earlier work of @xcite .",
    "the additional changes caused by the direct effects of the magnetic field on the eos will be reported in a future work @xcite .    while @xcite also presented solutions for rotating neutron stars endowed with large magnetic fields , in this work we present only static solutions . in terms of the potential observability of the effects of large magnetic fields",
    ", the most relevant situation appears to be for non - rotating stars .",
    "neutron stars with the highest inferred magnetic fields  the so - called `` magnetars''are all observed to be rotating very slowly , with periods on the order of seconds .",
    "the effects of such slow rotation should have a negligible impact on the neutron star structure .    in this paper",
    "we extend the work of @xcite .",
    "the theoretical formalism is outlined in  [ sec : form ] , which serves to put the problem in context . in  [ sec : himass ] we shed light on an issue left somewhat unclear by @xcite : what physically determines the maximum mass and magnetic field for a given maximum density or given baryon mass ? in order to explore these questions we have chosen to solve the structural equations using a green s function technique rather than the spectral technique employed by @xcite , and we also searched for the maximum mass , for a given magnetic field distribution , in a different way .",
    "an appendix describes our numerical methods and tests of our code . in  [ sec : constmb ] we present an illuminating view of constant baryon mass and constant magnetic moment sequences , and present higher mass configurations than those found by @xcite for the equations of state ( eoss ) they employed .",
    "in addition , we present the results of analogous calculations using three more recent eoss .",
    "summary and outlook are contained in  [ sec : sumout ] .",
    "we consider stationary neutron star models in which the equation of state is independent of the magnetic field .",
    "the relevant equations and some properties of neutron stars in this limit were studied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the stress - energy tensor is given by the sum of the standard stress - energy tensors of a perfect fluid and the electromagnetic field : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are respectively the rest - frame energy density and pressure , @xmath27 is the fluid 4-velocity , @xmath28 are the metric components , and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the electromagnetic potential 1-form .",
    "at least two relativistic formulations of the problem of strongly nonspherical axisymmetric stars have been developed .",
    "most authors studying rapid rotation have adopted the approach of @xcite , which explicitly assumes an isotropic stress tensor and is thus incompatible with electromagnetic fields .",
    "building on earlier work of @xcite and @xcite , @xcite present a formulation which allows for the most general stress - energy tensor consistent with a spacetime having the properties of stationarity , axisymmetry , and circularity .",

    "( a spacetime having the properties of stationarity and axisymmetry , but not circularity , would have an additional off - diagonal term in the metric @xcite ) .",
    "for the spacetime to have the property of circularity in addition to the properties of stationarity and axisymmetry , it is necessary that the electromagnetic current 4-vector and fluid 4-velocity be parallel to a general linear combination of the killing vectors @xcite .",

    "the constant @xmath89 is determined by an input parameter , e.g. the density specified at some point in the star .    in summary ,",
    "the formalism of stationary neutron stars in poloidal magnetic fields with a one - parameter equation of state consists of a closed system of eleven variables [ four metric variables , energy density , pressure , two components of the electromagnetic potential , two components of the electromagnetic current , and the `` heat function '' @xmath90 of equation ( [ heatfunc ] ) ] ; eleven equations [ four poisson equations ( [ d1][d4 ] ) for the metric variables , two poisson equations ( [ ateq]-[apheq ] ) for the components of the electromagnetic potential , the relation ( [ arel ] ) between the components of the electromagnetic potential , the equation of state , the relation ( [ heatfunc ] ) between the heat function and @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the first integral ( [ bern2 ] ) of the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium , and the restriction ( [ current ] ) on the electromagnetic current ] ; three input parameters ( angular velocity , total electric charge , and maximum density ) ; and one input function [ the @xmath84 in equation ( [ current ] ) ] .",
    "as noted in the introduction , in this study we restrict ourselves to the static case .",
    "this involves a number of simplifications , including the vanishing of @xmath34 , @xmath39 and @xmath37 , and the absence of surface charges generally present on perfectly conducting rotating bodies .",
    "@xcite present numerical calculations aimed at determining `` the maximum mass configuration among all static magnetized models '' for several equations of state and for the choice of constant current function @xmath91 .",
    "these static configurations are determined by two parameters , which @xcite took to be the central density and @xmath92 .",
    "they considered sequences of constant magnetic dipole moment @xmath93 , which is defined in terms of the asymptotic behavior of ( the orthonormal components of ) the magnetic field , @xmath94 and then determined the maximum mass for each value of @xmath93 .",
    "for example , using the `` pol2 '' @xmath95 polytropic equation of state @xcite , they reported the maximum mass among all static configurations to be @xmath96 , with a magnetic moment of @xmath97 a m@xmath98 .",
    "we have calculated , also using the pol2 eos , a similar configuration , which is pictured in figure [ contour ] , and may be compared with figures 5 and 6 of @xcite .",
    "we point out that in figures [ contour ] through [ dnudr ] that we use the same polytropic constant in the pol2 eos as that employed by @xcite .",
    "however , in later figures and in all tables , we have altered the polytropic constant to a more realistic value so that the maximum mass of static configurations is @xmath99 , and then scaled the results from the other groups accordingly in these tables and figures .",
    "@xcite also note that `` for magnetic fields higher than [ this configuration ] , no stationary configuration can exist and the numerical procedure",
    " fails to converge . ''",
    "note that this is not a question of _ stability_nothing is being claimed about the stability of the high field configurations they achieve  the question pertains to even the _ existence _ of stationary solutions .",
    "the fact that the maximum mass and magnetic moment are determined by the failure of their code to converge leaves one wondering whether a genuine physical limit has been reached , or whether the result simply represents the failure of the numerical method to find solutions that do in fact exist .",
    "this situation is in contrast to the case of rotation : it is well known that there is an upper limit to the angular velocity of uniformly rotating stars .",
    "numerical codes that attempt to solve for stellar configurations with uniform angular velocities above this limit will fail to converge . however , there is also a well - defined physical basis for this `` keplerian '' limit , namely , mass shedding .    at the mass shedding limit",
    ", a fluid element at the equatorial surface undergoes geodesic motion : it can remain in that orbit without any pressure support from the star .",
    "thus , it is not necessary to rely only on the failure of the code to converge to determine the mass shedding limit ; one can quantitatively test for geodesic motion at the equatorial surface .",
    "the approach to the mass shedding limit can also be visualized using the first integral of the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium  the relativistic generalization of the bernoulli equation . from equation ( [ bern2 ] ) , the `` bernoulli equation '' for a uniformly rotating star without a magnetic field is @xmath100 figure [ potrotmult ] demonstrates how the bernoulli equation can be used to visualize the approach to the mass shedding limit . in this figure the dashed lines represent @xmath32 , the dot - dashed lines represent @xmath101 , and the thick solid lines represent @xmath102 , all as functions of a compactified radial coordinate in the equatorial plane .",
    "the dotted lines represent @xmath89 , so that @xmath90 is given by the distance between the dotted and thick solid lines .",
    "the surface of the star ( @xmath103 ) then corresponds to the intersection of the dotted and thick solid lines . in the lower panel of figure [ potrotmult ] , which represents the mass shedding limit , the equatorial surface of the star coincides with the maximum of @xmath102 . for larger angular velocities , @xmath89 would be larger than this maximum , and there would be no surface of the star at finite radius .",
    "similar plots can be made for stationary stars with magnetic fields . for a nonrotating star in a poloidal magnetic field , equation ( [ bern2 ] ) reduces to @xmath104 now , in the equatorial plane , along which direction are magnetic forces exerted ?",
    "the answer depends on the direction of the magnetic field , which in turn depends on the current distribution in the star . from equation ( [ current ] )",
    "( with @xmath62 and @xmath37 set to zero in the present static case ) , the electric current density is proportional to @xmath105 , so that in the typical case one would expect the current to vanish on the surface of the star .",
    "the current measured by a local observer must also vanish on the axis of symmetry .",
    "hence the current @xmath106 measured by a local observer in the equatorial plane is expected to have a structure that peaks somewhere inside the star and vanishes at the origin and the surface , as shown in the left panel of figure [ radial ] for the pol2 eos .",
    "since the magnetic field lines tend to circle around a point in the vicinity of the maximum current ( see the right panel in figure [ contour ] ) , in the equatorial plane the field reverses direction inside the star .",
    "accordingly , the lorentz force reverses direction inside the star , as displayed in the right panel of figure [ radial ] .    the lorentz force and",
    "the other `` forces '' acting in the equatorial plane are derivatives of the quantities appearing in equation ( [ bernmag ] ) .",
    "these quantities are plotted in figure [ potmagmult ] for the pol2 eos , which is similar to figure [ potrotmult ] , except that the dot - dashed lines now represent the magnetic potential @xmath87 in equation ( [ bern2 ] ) , given in this case by equation ( [ magpot ] ) with @xmath107 . in the inner portion of the star , the lorentz force behaves like a centrifugal force , pushing outward and allowing the star to support more mass .",
    "as seen in the lower panel of figure [ potmagmult ] ( and in the left panel of figure [ contour ] ) , this outward force can be strong enough to cause the maximum of @xmath90 ( and hence @xmath25 ) to be off - center .",
    "however , the reversal of the force at larger radii makes the total `` potential '' confining .",
    "thus , in contrast to the case of rotation , there is no mass shedding limit at the equatorial surface that clearly indicates the nonexistence of stationary solutions and explains the failure of the code to converge for large magnetic fields .    if mass shedding does not occur , is there some other identifiable physical cause that prevents the existence of stationary solutions for sufficiently large magnetic fields ?",
    "@xcite note that for sufficiently large fields , the total ( fluid + magnetic ) stress tensor has a component on the symmetry axis that goes from being positive ( pressure ) to negative ( tension ) , causing the star to have a characteristic `` pinched '' shape ( see the left panel of figure [ contour ] ) .",
    "this occurs when the `` magnetic pressure '' exceeds the fluid pressure .",
    "they note that in the largest mass configurations they obtain , the ratio of the magnetic to fluid pressures at the center of the star is of order unity . however , there are two reasons that argue against considering this as a definitive physical reason preventing the existence of stationary solutions .",
    "the first is a matter of principle : the equilibrium of fluid elements relies on a balance between gravity and and the _ gradients _ of stresses ; the absolute sign of the stresses themselves is not of fundamental importance .",
    "the second reason is the results observed in practice : the value of the ratio of magnetic pressure to fluid pressure at the center of the star reported by @xcite , for the putative maximum mass configurations , varies quite noticeably among different equations of state , and its value is not predictable .",
    "this is not what one would expect of a precise physical criterion for the nonexistence of stationary solutions",
    ".    for newtonian stars , @xcite identified gravitational binding , or a negative total energy ( excluding rest mass ) , as a necessary criterion for the dynamical stability of equilibrium solutions . for nonrotating polytropes , they used a generalization of the virial theorem that accounts for magnetic fields to show that a negative total energy requires that the magnitude of the gravitational potential energy must be greater than the magnetic field energy .",
    "one might wonder whether a criterion of gravitational binding could represent a physical upper limit on stellar magnetic fields in the relativistic case as well .",
    "while total gravitational and magnetic energies are not well defined in relativity , in some sense the gravitational mass @xmath108 contains all forms of `` energy , '' including `` magnetic energy . ''",
    "since the total baryon number [ or total baryon mass @xmath109 ( baryon mass ) @xmath110 ( baryon number ) ] is a well defined quantity , one might consider using the relation @xmath111 as a criterion for gravitational binding . as it turns out , the putative maximum mass and maximum field configurations reported by @xcite are still `` gravitationally bound '' by this criterion .",
    "the question remains : as the influence of the magnetic field increases , is this apparent transition from existence to nonexistence of static solutions , occuring at finite `` gravitational binding , '' a physical result or a numerical artifact ?    in order to explore these questions we have searched for the maximum mass in a different way than bocquet et al .",
    "as mentioned previously , @xcite computed sequences of constant magnetic moment @xmath93 by suitably adjusting the central log - enthalpy @xmath112 and the value @xmath92 of the ( constant ) current function @xmath113 . for each value of @xmath93",
    "they determined the maximum mass .",
    "the overall maximum mass was obtained with the largest value of @xmath93 for which convergence could be achieved .",
    "in contrast , we have chosen a more direct means of exploring parameter space .",
    "for each value of maximum log - enthalpy @xmath114 ( which for large fields will _ not _ coincide with @xmath112 ) , we found the largest values of @xmath92 for which the code converged .",
    "specifying @xmath114 instead of @xmath112 allows for the possibility of vanishing density at the origin , i.e. toroidal configurations .",
    "a close inspection of the forces in configurations near the failure to converge reveals an apparent physical cause , for the choice of constant current function , of the failure to find stationary solutions for sufficiently large magnetic fields : _ when a sufficient quantity of matter has been pushed off - center by magnetic forces that gravitational forces begin to point radially outward in the equatorial plane , a topological change to a toroidal configuration ensues .",
    "_ this is illustrated by figure [ runaway ] for the pol2 eos , which shows the late stages of iteration of a configuration with a value of @xmath92 that is slightly too large for convergence .",
    "we emphasize that the stages depicted in this figure are not valid stationary solutions to the einstein equations ; neither do they represent a true evolution . nevertheless , the sequence is suggestive of possible dynamical outcomes : a transition to a toroidal topology , expansion of the torus to large radii , and increasing compactification of the toroidal configuration of matter . as the iterations proceed , the outward pointing gravitational force ( positive @xmath115 or @xmath116 ) becomes more and more pronounced .",
    "the central evacuation begins , however , with a tiny outward gravitational force at some radius .",
    "since we were unable to find any convergent toroidal solutions for the case of a constant current function @xmath113 , we can therefore identify a quantitative criterion for the boundary of existence of stationary solutions in this case : this boundary is characterized by @xmath117 at some off - center location in the equatorial plane . by symmetry , it is always the case that @xmath117 at the origin ; furthermore , the positive - semidefiniteness of energy density and pressure ensure that @xmath118 at the origin ( this can be verified from the green s function expansions of the metric functions presented in appendix a ) .",
    "this means that the critical condition @xmath119 can not occur at the origin or an infinitesimal region surrounding it , but our numerical calculations indicate that it first occurs very close to the origin .",
    "these matters are illustrated in figure [ dnudr ] with the pol2 eos , which shows the radial profile of the gravitational force for increasing values of @xmath92at a particular value of maximum density  including the largest value of @xmath92 for which convergence was achieved . in the upper panel ,",
    "a flattening of the gravitational force near the center with increasing magnetic field is apparent .",
    "the insets in the upper panel show the region near the origin .",
    "the lower left inset shows @xmath120 as computed with a formula obtained by differentiating equation ( [ nugreen ] ) . as required by the condition @xmath118 at the origin , according to this formula the first off - origin grid point has negative value of @xmath120 . for the largest value of @xmath92",
    ", the next grid point is less negative , but still does not reach our asserted condition @xmath121 .",
    "however , the upper right inset in the upper panel shows values of @xmath122 near the origin computed from a the centered finite difference formula , which is closer to what the discretized configuration actually `` feels . ''",
    "computed in this way , the first off - origin grid point has a barely positive value of @xmath120 for the largest value of @xmath92 for which convergence was achieved .",
    "the lower panel of figure [ dnudr ] shows the gravitational force for the largest value of @xmath92 , for three different grid resolutions .",
    "the insets of this panel again compare the `` analytic '' and `` numerical '' derivatives .",
    "these computations show that with increasing resolution , the `` analytic '' derivative near the origin gets closer and closer to the critical condition @xmath121 . in practice , however , the maximum mass and magnetic field configuration for a given stellar maximum density can be identified by the appearance of a small positive value of @xmath120 , as computed with a centered finite difference .    for the values of maximum density we studied , and",
    "for a constant current function @xmath113 , we did not find any stationary toroidal solutions .",
    "the toroidal configurations continued to expand in radius and compress into thinner and thinner rings until the region covered by matter consisted of only a few gridpoints , at which point the code would fail .",
    "a determination of the outcome of the evolution of such configurations  whether to a stationary solution characterized by a different current function , dispersal to infinity , or even the formation of a toroidal event horizon @xcite  would appear to require a fully relativistic evolution code .",
    "it remains to be seen if these results  namely , the prescription for determining when magnetic forces are too strong for the existence of static configurations , and the lack of converged toroidal solutions  will hold for more general current functions .",
    "our computations of static neutron stars with ultra - strong magnetic fields determined by a constant current function are summarized in table [ tbl-25 ] and figures [ mr1 ] and [ mr2 ] .",
    "figure [ mr1 ] contains some of the older eoss employed by @xcite .",

    "the lighter solid curves are sequences of constant baryon mass @xmath123 ( and varying magnetic moment @xmath124 ) , while the dotted curves are sequences of constant magnetic moment ( and varying baryon mass ) .",
    "the lighter shaded regions indicate configurations in which the magnetic field is sufficiently strong that the maximum density is off - center .",
    "the small slivers of darkly shaded regions towards the left sides of the plots indicate solutions which are gravitationally unbound ( @xmath125 ) ; these are expected to be dynamically unstable .    as with rotation ,",
    "magnetic fields allow neutron stars with a particular eos and baryon number to have larger masses and equatorial radii compared to the field - free case . in figures",
    "[ mr1 ] and [ mr2 ] , the configurations of maximum mass that can be reached by uniform rotation ( without magnetic fields ) are marked with an `` x '' .",
    "for all the eoss displayed , our result for the maximum mass attainable with a magnetic field governed by a constant current function is noticeably larger than that attained by rotation .",
    "this contrasts with the results reported by @xcite for the maximum mass attainable with magnetic fields , shown in figure [ mr1 ] with crosses . out of the three eoss",
    "we have in common , only in the case of the polytropic eos do @xcite obtain a significantly larger mass with magnetic fields than with rotation .    in the absence of significant accretion , constant baryon mass sequences are of interest as potential evolutionary paths .",
    "this is well motivated in the case of uniformly rotating non - magnetic stars : as angular momentum is slowly dissipated by gravitational radiation , the star moves along a sequence of constant baryon mass until it either stops rotating ( for `` normal '' sequences terminating on the spherical mass vs. radius curve ) or collapses to a black hole [ for `` supramassive '' sequences which exist solely by virtue of rotation ; stars on such sequences may exhibit the interesting phenomenon of spin - up during angular momentum loss just before collapse to black hole @xcite ] .",
    "these scenarios are well motivated because of the expectation that once viscosity brings a dynamically stable star into uniform rotation , it will not spontaneously begin to differentially rotate as it loses angular momentum .    on the other hand , representing evolutionary sequences by the constant baryon mass sequences for magnetized stars pictured in figures [ mr1 ] and [ mr2 ] is an oversimplification .",
    "even though a star s magnetic field will slowly ( on dynamical time scales ) decay due to hall drift and ambipolar diffusion , there is no guarantee that the star s configuration will proceed along the paths pictured in the figures .",
    "this is because the case of magnetic fields is more analogous to differential rotation rather than uniform rotation , the necessary choice of a current function in the magnetic case [ see equation ( [ current ] ) and surrounding discussion ] corresponding to the choice of a rotation law in the case of differential rotation . as a star s magnetic field decays , it is not obvious that its current function will remain the same .",
    "perhaps the study of several different current functions could shed light on probable evolutionary sequences .",
    "for example , an analysis of how the mass varies with the functional form of the current function ( at fixed baryon mass and magnetic moment ) could give an idea of how the slow evolution with magnetic field decay might proceed .",
    "there is of course no principle of `` conservation of magnetic moment , '' but since the time scale for magnetic field decay is slow , this procedure seems like a plausible opening exploration .    in connection with the constant baryon mass sequences , we here comment on a curious feature in figures [ mr1 ] and [ mr2 ] .",
    "for the potential model eoss bji , pandn and akmal , the topology of these sequences near the maximum spherically symmetric star appears to be different than for the polytropic or relativistic field theoretical models pcl and pclhyp . in the former ,",
    "there is a minimum in the baryon mass above the spherical , non - magnetized , sequence . to determine if this feature was related to the possible acausal behavior of potential models at high density , we modified the pandn eos to go over to a causality limit eos when necessary , but found that the topology was unaltered .",
    "instead , the effect appears to be related to the fact that all forms of energy contribute to the magnetic field : while the newtonian intuition ( and the relativstic behavior at lower densities ) is that magnetic fields always increase the gravitational mass of a star of given baryon number , the fact that the energy density in magnetic fields can be a nontrivial source of gravitation means that this self - gravitating tendency can compete with the tendency of the lorenz force to help support the star .",
    "perhaps this occurs near the spherical maximum mass in the case of the potential model eoss , with the result that configurations near the spherical maximum mass have nowhere to go but down in gravitational mass when magnetic fields ( governed by a constant current function ) are added .",
    "if a star did preserve its current function and follow a supramassive constant baryon mass sequence possessing such a gap , upon reaching the minimum mass of the sequence it could catastrophically collapse to a spherical neutron star rather than a black hole . while the possibility is admittedly remote , this could be a novel form of energy release in a baryon - free environment , giving rise to a mini-@xmath13-ray burst .",
    "except for the spherical stars , those with no magnetization indicated by the lower solid line in these figures , the stability of the configurations has not been studied . for spherical stars",
    ", it is well - known that the configurations with larger radii than the maximum mass configuration are stable .",
    "one might speculate that constant baryon mass sequences which terminate on the stable side of the spherical @xmath108 vs. @xmath126 curve are stable , while those ending on the unstable side would be unstable , and that for supramassive constant baryon mass sequences the minimum mass marks a change from stability to instability . but this remains to be determined . as with differentially rotating stars , it is necessary to do a normal mode analysis , or even a fully relativistic evolution ; see @xcite .",
    "incidentally , it is interesting to note that these authors find a differentially rotating configuration with a `` red blood cell '' shape similar to our extreme magnetic configurations , and that this configuration is dynamically stable . of course",
    ", their configuration was not subject to mhd instabilities that may come into play @xcite .",
    "in summary , we present a method of computing the structure of axisymmteric relativistic stars that combines elements of previous approaches , and report tests of our code . a quantitative method of determining the outer envelope ( in the mass vs. radius plane ) of configurations attainable with poloidal magnetic fields governed by a constant `` current function '' [ see equation ( [ current ] ) ] has been found : magnetic fields are too large for static configurations to exist when the magnetic force pushes a sufficient amount of mass off - center that the gravitational force points outward near the origin in the equatorial plane .",
    "( in our coordinates an outward gravitational force corresponds to @xmath127 . )",
    "we obtain larger masses of neutron stars in ultra - strong magnetic fields than have been reported previously for various equations of state , and performed computations with three representative modern eoss .",
    "sequences of constant baryon mass and constant magnetic moment are displayed .",
    "for all eoss studied , the maximum attainable mass of static stars with a magnetic field determined by a constant current function is noticeably larger than that attainable with uniform rotation and no magnetic field .",
    "the results presented here are only an initial step in exploring possible configurations of neutron stars with strong magnetic fields .",
    "as we mention below , configurations with azimuthal field components will be of physical interest , which implies that three - dimensional geometries should also be considered .",
    "but even with attention restricted to poloidal fields , we have only scratched the surface of possible configurations , as we have only considered a single current function . @xcite",
    "make brief mention of computations with a few other current functions . we have performed a handful of exploratory computations using a polytropic eos and other current functions and have found some toroidal solutions .",
    "these toroidal solutions were not attainable with the computational approach of @xcite , since their method involved the specification of a finite density at the center of the star . in the case of toroidal configurations ,",
    "the simple condition determining the boundary of existence of static configurations will have to be generalized , since there is no matter at the center .",
    "these explorations will be reported in detail elsewhere .",
    "our work here has focused on the effects magnetic fields have on general relativistic structure , ignoring the effects of intense magnetic fields on the eoss .",
    "recently , the direct effects of magnetic fields on the eos have also been investigated @xcite .",
    "substantial effects on the eos above nuclear saturation densities are generally produced by fields in excess of @xmath21 g , which is of the order of the maximum central field strengths found in this paper .",
    "the generic effects on the eos include softening due to landau quantization , which is , however , overwhelmed by stiffening due to the incorporation of the magnetic moments of the various particles in neutron star matter @xcite .",
    "( note that the important @xmath128 term is already included in our study . )",
    "work is in progress ( cardall et al .",
    "2000 , in preparation ) to provide fully self - consistent calculations of neutron star structure , in which the direct effects of magnetic fields on the eos will be included in addition to the structural effects considered in this work .",
    "an issue which we defer to future work is the question of stability . for systems governed by a finite number of parameters ,",
    "a generalization @xcite of the familiar one - dimensional turning point method can be employed ; see @xcite for an application to uniformly rotating relativistic stars . however , as with differentially rotating stars , this generalized turning point method is not really applicable in the present case .",
    "this is because the need to specify a current function ( or rotation law in the case of differential rotation ) means that defining a particular configuration requires the specification of an _ infinite _ number of parameters .",
    "another issue that needs further explication before the physical relevance of the results presented here can be fully assessed is the generation of magnetic fields .",
    "we have mentioned the mechanism of @xcite , the generation of magnetic fields during the smoothing of differential rotation",
    ". however , the azimuthal dragging of field lines by differential rotation leads to nonvanishing azimuthal field components , in constrast to the poloidal fields studied here .",
    "it is not clear whether fields with azimuthal components would evolve into poloidal configurations , or whether there are mechanisms to directly generate strong poloidal fields .",
    "it would be of interest to explore the possibility of finding stationary solutions with toroidal magnetic fields , and in three dimensions .",
    "while this would involve more nonzero metric components , perhaps methods similar to those employed in this paper could be employed ; see @xcite .",

    "described above , the source term @xmath160 is divided into two parts , with the `` matter part '' @xmath161 containing source terms deriving from the stress - energy tensor , and the `` field part '' @xmath162 containing terms involving derivatives of the metric variables .",
    "the poisson equation for @xmath32 is solved in two parts : @xmath163 , where @xmath164 ; and @xmath165 .",

    "this is not necessarily the central density ; its location @xmath170 must be determined at each iteration .",
    "specifying the maximum density while allowing its location to `` float '' allows for the possibility of toroidal configurations , a possibility excluded by the method of @xcite and @xcite .    in order to test the ability of our code to solve the einstein equations for axisymmetric configurations ,",
    "we have studied uniformly rotating configurations with a poltropic eos and two tabulated `` realistic '' eos from the literature .",

    "slightly larger differences in the case of the tabulated eos are well - attested in the literature , resulting from different methods of interpolation , matching between different density regimes , etc .",
    "we tried two methods of determining the `` heat function '' @xmath90 from the tabulated eos : 1 ) direct integration of equation ( [ heatfunc ] ) , and 2 ) use of an analytic formula derived from equation ( [ heatfunc ] ) with the first law of thermodynamics .",
    "@xcite used the analytic formula , and when employing this method we obtained closer agreement with the results of those authors .",
    "however , we achieved smaller values of @xmath171 ( indicating better solutions ) when constructing @xmath90 by direct integration .",
    "this was apparently the method employed by @xcite , as our results with this method agree more closely with theirs .",
    "our calculations underlying the entries in table [ tbl-1]and , indeed , our calculations with tabulated eos reported throughout this work  employed the construction of @xmath90 by direct integration .    in our experience the calculations of rotating configurations with tabulated eos had a tendency towards numerical instability for large angular velocities , manifested as growing oscillations in various quantities ( as opposed to the monotonic runaway occurring past the keplerian limit ) .",
    "we found that this instability could be controlled by updating the metric variable @xmath34 only once every @xmath172 iterations , where we took @xmath172 as high as 15 when approaching the keplerian limit .",
    "this procedure was not necessary with the polytropic eos we used .",
    "we also tested our code s ability to reliably compute static neutron star configurations with large magnetic fields .",
    "as reported in the main text , our results for the maximum mass of neutron stars with constant current function @xmath92 are larger than those reported by @xcite .",
    "hence comparison of these maximum mass configurations does not really constitute a verification of our code .",
    "however , @xcite also presented results for the maximum mass at a certain fixed low values of magnetic moment , and comparison of these results provides a benchmark against which our code can be checked .",
    "in addition , we can compute configurations close to those reported by @xcite as the maximum mass , and make a comparison  even though these are not our maximum mass configurations .",
    "the results of these calculations are presented in table [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "for each eos , three sets of calculations are presented .",
    "the first set contains results of stars without magnetic fields  the same data appearing in table [ tbl-1]as a baseline .",
    "the second set shows results for the maximum mass at a given fixed ( relatively low ) value of magnetic moment .",
    "the third set for each eos has two entries of our calculations .",
    "these two configurations represent the boundaries of the range of configurations , at fixed magnetic moment , whose baryon mass rounds to the value reported by @xcite as the maximum baryon mass among all configurations with constant current function .",
    "the results are satisfactorily concordant . for a visual comparison ,",
    "our figure [ contour ] can be checked against figures 5 and 6 of @xcite .",
    "we have cited three classes of tests which validate our code .",
    "first , the quantity @xmath171 is close to zero as required of valid solutions .",
    "second , our results for quantities characterizing the maximum mass configuration among uniformly rotating stars agree well with those of two previous groups .",

    "<S> we study static neutron stars with poloidal magnetic fields and a simple class of electric current distributions consistent with the requirement of stationarity . for this class of electric current distributions , we find that magnetic fields are too large for static configurations to exist when the magnetic force pushes a sufficient amount of mass off - center that the gravitational force points outward near the origin in the equatorial plane . </S>",
