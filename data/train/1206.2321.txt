    "qualitative and quantitative analyses of mixing in phase space are often key components of understanding the dynamics of a complex system .",
    "our focus is on systems exhibiting deterministic behavior , although our discussion is applicable to stochastic systems for which the full dynamics can be considered a deterministic ` template ' on which an added stochastic behavior plays a secondary role . from the perspective of dynamical systems theory ,",
    "the presence of mixing in phase space is synonymous with the existence of chaotic trajectories .",
    "there has been a significant amount of interest in understanding how such chaotic behavior arises , how to detect it , and how to design for or against it @xcite .",
    "the field of fluid mechanics has been a particularly productive proving ground for understanding mixing in dynamical systems .",
    "consider , for example , the development @xcite and growth @xcite of the field of chaotic advection , the phenomenon in which advective transport by a regular velocity field leads to chaotic particle trajectories .",
    "given an incompressible fluid moving with a velocity field @xmath0 , one can write the advection equations of motion for a passive fluid particle at position @xmath1 as @xmath2 non - autonomous two - dimensional systems or autonomous three - dimensional systems are capable of generating chaotic particle trajectories even if the underlying velocity field is not chaotic or stochastic .",
    "in the dynamical systems vernacular , a mixing system is one that generates chaotic trajectories . from the perspective of fluid mechanics ,",
    "this advective transport is typically referred to as ` stirring ' , with the term ` mixing ' usually reserved for homogenization due to the combined effect of stirring and molecular diffusion .",
    "it is usually assumed , and often correctly so , that dynamical systems mixing is synonymous with fluid mixing , and here we will use the terms interchangeably . this approach to understanding and predicting mixing has played an important role in the engineering analysis of laminar flows , and it has been particularly valuable in the development of microfluidics @xcite . from the perspective of dynamical systems theory , this connection between regular flows and chaotic trajectories was previously known @xcite . however , it was not until the concept of chaotic advection took root that the general scientific community fully realized the ubiquitous existence of relatively simple flows capable of generating chaotic transport .    in a typical analysis of chaotic advection ,",
    "one requires a detailed spatio - temporal characterization of transport throughout the flow domain in order to quantify mixing from the perspective of ergodic theory using metric quantities .",
    "poincar sections and lyapunov exponents , and the closely - related measure - theoretic or kolmogorov - sinai ( ks ) entropy @xcite , are generated by accurately tracking individual particles for very long times  @xcite .",
    "quantifications of transport using lobe dynamics involve tracking exponentially - stretched interfaces forward and backward in time in order to determine stable and unstable manifolds and the area ( or volume ) that they encompass @xcite .",
    "lagrangian coherent structures ( lcs ) , which can be viewed as generalizations of manifolds , are determined using the finite - time lyapunov exponent field @xcite .",
    "each of these methods provides important information about chaos in a domain , but they give information only in those regions of the domain where detailed metric calculations can be made , and having incomplete information often prevents analysis .    in an alternative approach , mixing is quantified using topological , as opposed to metric , characteristics of the flow .",
    "applications of topology to analyzing fluid motion date back to helmholtz @xcite , but the topological approach we employ here is a modern development @xcite .",
    "the core idea in this approach is to use the topological classification of a few entangled periodic orbits to place a lower bound on the exponential growth rate of material surfaces under iteration of the flow .",
    "the connection between topology and exponential growth rates originated with adler , konheim and mcandrew s definition of _ topological entropy _ , which we will call @xmath3 , as an analogue of the ks entropy @xcite .",
    "there is an enormous body of work concerning the dynamical meaning of @xmath3 and ways to compute and estimate it .",
    "here we focus our attention on the main ideas and results that are relevant to the problem at hand .",
    "the first key idea is the relation between @xmath3 and the exponential growth rates of various quantities induced by iteration of a function .",
    "perhaps the strongest such result is the proof by yomdin @xcite of shub s entropy conjecture that @xmath3 is bounded below by the log of the spectral radius of the induced action on homology .",
    "that is , the algebraic representation of the system topology ( i.e. ,  homology ) produces a matrix representation of the iterated flow map ( i.e. ,  the action ) , and the log of the leading eigenvalue gives a lower bound on @xmath3 for that flow .",
    "newhouse extended this result to the scenario of interest here by showing that for @xmath4-diffeomorphisms ( i.e. , infinitely differentiable , invertible mappings ) of surfaces , which includes all singularity - free deterministic fluid flows , @xmath3 is equal to the maximal growth rate of smooth arcs under the action of the diffeomorphism .",
    "he also showed the important result that @xmath3 varies continuously under infinitely smooth perturbations of the action , i.e. , in @xmath4-families @xcite .",
    "also of importance here is the related ( and earlier ) result of bowen @xcite that @xmath3 is bounded below by the growth rate of the induced action on the fundamental group , which consists of sets of equivalence classes of loops under homotopy , i.e. ,  each set in the fundamental group consists of a class of loops that are equivalent under continuous deformation .",
    "that is , bowen proved that the growth rate of ` representative loops ' gives a lower bound on @xmath3 .",
    "that paper also contains what later became a key observation , namely , that by puncturing a surface at a periodic orbit and studying the action restricted to the punctured surface , one could get better lower bounds for the entropy using strictly algebraic means .",
    "bowen@xcite makes the prescient remark that thurston s classification of surface isotopy classes can be used to good effect on the punctured surface .",
    "we thus come to the second key mathematical tool used here : thurston s theorem on a surface punctured at a periodic orbit @xcite . again",
    ", this concept has been the subject of a large body of work , which we consider here to only a limited extent ; see boyland@xcite for a excellent survey and additional references .",
    "the thurston  nielsen classification theorem ( referred to hereafter as tnct ) characterizes the isotopy classes of continuous , one - to - one , invertible , orientable maps , or homeomorphisms , of punctured surfaces . since we are discussing the application of this work in the context of fluid flows",
    ", we will further restrict our discussion to differentiable maps of two - dimensional manifolds , i.e.  to surface diffeomorphisms .",
    "the topological complexity in the system is introduced through the relative motions of the punctures induced by the flow map .",
    "the surfaces under consideration are @xmath5-punctured disks , @xmath6 , in which the @xmath5 punctures can correspond to physical obstructions @xcite , periodic orbits @xcite , or other stirrer - like objects that entangle the surrounding fluid , such as point vortices @xcite . since it is topology being considered here , the specific shapes of the disk and the punctures do not matter . in dynamical systems applications , these surfaces are typically two - dimensional physical space and the maps act in time , but under certain conditions maps can also be constructed in three - dimensional space @xcite .",
    "an isotopy class consists of all the topologically equivalent diffeomorphisms that can be mapped to each other through a ` fixed stirrer ' diffeomorphism in which the punctures are fixed relative to each other during the mapping .",
    "according to the tnct , each isotopy class contains a representative homeomorphism @xmath7 , the _ thurston  nielsen ( tn ) representative _ , that is one of three possible types : _ finite order _ ( fo ) , _ pseudo - anosov _ ( pa ) , or _",
    "reducible_. if @xmath7 is fo , then its @xmath8 iterate is the identity map in which the punctures are held fixed and all points in @xmath6 map to themselves , so no net stretching occurs .",
    "all fixed stirrer diffeomorphisms are isotopic to the identity .",
    "if @xmath7 is pa , then it stretches and contracts everywhere on the surface by factors @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "iteration of a pa @xmath7 results in exponential stretching of smooth arcs with corresponding topological entropy @xmath11 .",
    "there are several methods by which one can compute @xmath12 ; for our analysis , we make use of the open - source code written by hall @xcite , which implements the bestvina - handel algorithm @xcite . a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition that an isotopy class contain a pa  @xmath7 is the existence of at least three punctures in the surface .",
    "finally , for the reducible case , @xmath7 leaves a family of curves invariant , and these curves delimit regions in which @xmath7 is either fo or pa .",
    "each isotopy class contains only one tn representative , so the isotopy class itself can be referred to as being of fo , pa , or reducible type .",
    "we focus here on cases for which the isotopy class is of pa type .",
    "the power of thurston s theorem in the analysis of dynamical systems comes from the connection between the tn representative @xmath7 and the complexity of a flow @xmath13 within the same isotopy class . by handel",
    "s isotopy stability theorem @xcite , if @xmath7 is pa and @xmath13 is isotopic to @xmath7 , then there exists a compact , @xmath13-invariant set @xmath14 and a continuous , onto mapping @xmath15 such that @xmath16 .",
    "thus , the complex dynamics of a pa @xmath7 are preserved by @xmath13 in ( some subset of ) the domain .",
    "the map @xmath17 may be many - to - one , so that the dynamics of @xmath13 may be more complicated than those of @xmath7 , but they are never less complicated . therefore , the existence of a pa @xmath7 places a lower bound on the complexity of any flow map @xmath13 from the same isotopy class .",
    "non - trivial material lines , such as curves that encircle two punctures or that connect punctures with each other and/or the disk boundary , will grow exponentially in length under @xmath18 iterates of @xmath13 according to @xmath19 , with associated topological entropy @xmath20 , and the tnct establishes that @xmath21 ( and @xmath22 ) .",
    "unfortunately , there are no restrictions on the size of @xmath23 , so the complicated dynamics may exist on a subset with lebesgue measure zero .",
    "however , the complexity associated with the exponential stretching and folding of material lines can not be removed by continuous perturbation of the domain that maintains the orbit topology .",
    "this topological chaos is thus `` built in '' to the system due to the orbit topology of only a finite number of punctures .",
    "the initial application of the tnct to fluid mixing examined a system of three cylindrical rods moving slowly on periodic trajectories through a viscous fluid in a cylindrical domain @xcite .",
    "the three rods exchanged positions pair - wise on circular trajectories .",
    "two stirring protocols were considered : one motion of fo type and one of pa  type . in the fo protocol , all motions involved clockwise interchanges . in the pa  protocol , the exchanges alternated between clockwise and counterclockwise , producing figure - eight rod trajectories . although these two motions were energetically equivalent ( in the stokes flow limit ) , the mixing produced by the pa  motion was clearly better than that produced by the fo motion . computational analysis of this flow system @xcite confirmed that the lower bound predicted by the tnct gives an excellent representation of the actual stretching rate caused by the pa  motion .",
    "furthermore , a substantial subset of the domain exhibited exponential stretching and folding , demonstrating that the dynamics of the tn representative can indeed be relevant to the analysis of a realistic fluid system .",
    "artin s braid group @xcite provides a useful framework for representing the trajectories of punctures under the action of the flow .",
    "each of the puncture trajectories is identified with a strand in a `` physical braid '' .",
    "the temporal reordering of these strands dictates the topological structure of the physical braid .",
    "the generator @xmath24 represents a clockwise exchange of strands @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and @xmath27 ( our shorthand notation for @xmath28 ) represents a counterclockwise exchange .",
    "a braid can be identified via a `` braid word '' of generator `` letters '' , which we read from right to left as time progresses .",
    "for example , the braid on three strands that we discuss in section  [ flow_description ] is represented by the braid word @xmath29 . since the braid word , or the `` mathematical braid '' , encodes only the topology of the braid crossings , each isotopy class on a punctured orientable two - dimensional surface",
    "is associated with one such braid .",
    "thus , we can refer to a braid as being of fo , pa , or reducible type . a brief overview of the connection between braid theory and topological chaos is given in section  [ reference_case ] , and a general introduction to braid theory can be found in , e.g. , @xcite .    from the mathematical point of view it is clear that the topological analysis of a fluid system can be based on the trajectories of periodic orbits , even when",
    "these orbits are not associated directly with stirring rods .",
    "such orbits can still appear to be ` stirring ' the surrounding fluid , and they have been thus been termed _",
    "in many cases , consideration of ghost rods is essential to understanding the presence of topological chaos in a system .",
    "for example , a single physical rod moving on an epicyclic trajectory in a two - dimensional domain @xcite produces a braid on one strand , which is in an isotopy class of fo type . however , it is clear from direct observation that stirring a stokes flow with this motion produces significant stretching and folding of material lines .",
    "this complexity can be explained using the tnct by noting that there are two important fixed points , or ghost rods , in the domain about which the moving rod winds .",
    "the braid on three strands corresponding to the space - time trajectories of the two fixed ghost rods _ and _ the moving rod is in an isotopy class of pa - type , and thus predicts the presence of chaos in the domain .",
    "the trajectories of moving ghost rods can also produce topological chaos , even when there are no physical rods in the system , such as in the lid - driven cavity flow discussed in section  [ flow_description ] that forms the basis for our present discussion .",
    "identifying braiding of ghost rods is an important step in applying the concepts of topological chaos to a broad range of fluid systems with no physical stirring rods .",
    "however , finding appropriate periodic orbits is a challenging task .",
    "one way of getting around this difficulty is to calculate the long - time braids generated by random collections of initial points @xcite .",
    "the topological entropy is estimated from these computed braid generators .",
    "this approach removes the need to identify periodic orbits in the flow but , since the braids being considered here are aperiodic , the tnct can not be invoked in the prediction of a lower bound . instead , relatively long - time calculations are needed .",
    "it has also been found that a random selection of trajectories in the flow typically leads to a poor estimate of overall system behavior @xcite , so a large statistical representation is required in this approach .",
    "we have recently considered a different approach to examining topological chaos in flows without physical rods and with no discernible low - order periodic orbits on which to base a topological analysis @xcite . in this view , the domain is divided into distinct subsets such that there is a very small probability that typical trajectories beginning in each subset will leave this subset in a short time .",
    "these _ almost - invariant sets _ ( aiss ) @xcite can be determined from the eigenspectrum of the discretized perron - frobenius transfer operator via a set - oriented approach , which we review in section  [ s : ais ] . in some cases ,",
    "disconnected components of an ais correspond to almost - periodic regions , or what has been referred to as _ almost - cyclic sets _ ( acss ) @xcite . since the acss consist of trajectories that move together for a relatively long time",
    ", the region of the domain corresponding to an acs can be identified as a ( leaky ) ghost rod , and a representative trajectory from each acs can be used to reveal the underlying braid structure .",
    "furthermore , since these acss contain almost - periodic orbits , the aperiodic braid they generate can be approximated by periodic continuation to a time - periodic braid .",
    "this time - periodic braid can be characterized using the tnct , and an estimate of the topological entropy can hence be determined .",
    "the topological entropy given by the tnct is no longer a strict lower bound , since the time - periodic braid is only an approximation of the true dynamical structure .",
    "however , it was demonstrated@xcite that this estimate can give a good representation of the flow .",
    "our earlier work@xcite considers creeping flow in a lid - driven cavity and starts with parameters for which there exist three periodic orbits , which we refer to as the reference case . for small perturbations from the reference case , consideration of acs braiding gives a clear explanation for the topological entropy in this flow .",
    "however , for certain larger perturbations from the reference case , we observe a drop in the numerically computed topological entropy below the lower bound predicted for the reference case .",
    "this paper extends the previous analysis to consider these larger perturbations , which leads us to our main observation .",
    "as we vary away from the reference case , the ais / acs structure appears to bifurcate , leading to a sequence of topologically distinct braids with differing numbers of strands .",
    "the motion in @xmath6 for each of these new braids on @xmath5 strands belongs to an isotopy class of pa type , and the corresponding value of @xmath12 gives a correct lower bound estimate on the topological entropy for the corresponding parameter value .",
    "hence , we give further evidence that these almost - cyclic sets are natural objects on which to base an application of the tnct .",
    "we assert that this work marks an important step in making the ghost rod methodology applicable to realistic fluid flows with arbitrary time - dependence when low - order periodic , braiding orbits are difficult to identify or do not exist .",
    "we also conjecture that this generalization is applicable to a wide variety of dynamical systems , not just fluid systems .",
    "the fluid system model that we analyze in this work is a simplified version of a system@xcite that allows for exact solutions .",
    "this relatively simple fluid system has an easily - visualized piecewise - steady velocity field , but due to the imposed time dependence it exhibits complicated dynamics .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional lid - driven cavity flow in an infinitely - wide cavity with height @xmath30 . under the assumption of stokes flow ,",
    "the stream function @xmath31 defined by @xmath32 satisfies the two - dimensional biharmonic equation , @xmath33 we assume that the flow is driven by prescribed tangential velocities on the top and bottom boundaries at @xmath34 .",

    "clockwise _ along their shared streamline .",
    "3 .   since the flow pattern is reflected about @xmath42 at @xmath70 , @xmath64 is a fixed point for @xmath71 , and @xmath72 and @xmath62 exchange their positions during this time period while moving _",
    "counterclockwise_.    after three periods of the flow , the points @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 return to their original positions .",

    "each of the braid generators has a matrix representation , and the braid matrix is given by the product of the generator matrices .",
    "the entries of burau matrices are laurent polynomials in some variable @xmath45 , which is taken to be @xmath77 here . the burau matrices can be heuristically understood as markov matrices that track the evolution of material lines connecting the points .",
    "for instance , in figure [ fig : linestretch ] , the generator @xmath78 stretches the line i to approximately look like the sum of lines i and ii while leaving the line ii intact , giving the relations i@xmath79i+ii and ii@xmath79ii .",

    "the stretching produced by topologically distinct flows with @xmath75 punctures , we will refer to the entropy in this reference case as @xmath87 .    for @xmath88",
    ", the dominant eigenvalue of the burau matrix only provides a lower bound for @xmath12 , and other methods must be used instead , such as the train - tracks algorithm @xcite or the encoding of loops @xcite .",
    "the actual topological entropy produced by the flow map , @xmath89 , can be determined by computing the asymptotic stretching rate of topologically non - trivial lines @xcite , such as lines that join a periodic point with the outer boundary .",
    "we estimate @xmath89 by following two orthogonal lines that are initially along the lines @xmath42 and @xmath67 , respectively , as they are stretched over 610 periods of the flow . for numerical reasons these lines",
    "are not extended all the way to the boundary , but instead are terminated a distance @xmath90 from the boundary . for this reference case ,",
    "these computations give @xmath91 , which is reasonably well represented by the lower bound , @xmath92 .",
    "for the analysis discussed here , we keep the ratio @xmath60 fixed while changing the value of @xmath36 away from unity .",
    "this perturbation increases ( for @xmath93 ) or decreases ( for @xmath94 ) the amount of rotation in the domain before switching , which has a direct effect on the stretching of material lines .",
    "the computed topological entropy for the flow is shown in figure  [ fig : entropy ] for a range of @xmath95 values .",
    "the entropy varies smoothly , as expected from the results of newhouse @xcite .",
    "the overall trend in @xmath89 is logical , as increasing @xmath36 increases the energy added to the flow during each period .",
    "however , the rate of increase in @xmath89 is not uniform , which we explain by considering the topology of the flow map .",
    "+    in the reference case with @xmath61 , the three period-3 points discussed in section  [ flow_description ] are parabolic points , which are structurally unstable . under small perturbations for @xmath93 ,",
    "each parabolic point bifurcates into a pair of periodic saddles and periodic centers , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : poin_101 ] .",
    "the stable and unstable manifolds that pass through the saddles ( i.e. , the hyperbolic points ) form barriers to transport , so that fluid within these regions moves together for a number of periods .",
    "these ` ghost rod ' structures are ` leaky ' , in that there is a small amount of transport across their boundaries due to the transverse intersections of the stable and unstable manifolds , form lobes .",
    "the amount of leakage per period is the amount of phase space enclosed by the lobe @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : poin_101](b , c ) , we show the manifold structure for the center ` leaky ghost rod ' for @xmath96 ( panel  b , where the the transversal intersection is present , but not evident ) and @xmath97 ( panel  c ) .",
    "the four period-3 points ( two hyperbolic and two elliptic ) that form the structure of a single ` leaky ghost rod ' produce a braid on 12 strands .",
    "the four strands corresponding to each individual ghost rod structure simply twist around each other , and as a result the braid on 12 strands is reducible to a braid on 3 strands .",
    "this mathematical braid on 3 strands is identical to the mathematical braid from the reference case .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath98 predicted by the tnct for the reference case remains the lower bound on @xmath89 for the perturbed flow we have considered here with @xmath93 .",
    "clearly there is additional stretching in these cases that is not captured by the tn representative , which suggests the presence of additional ghost rods .",
    "we do not explore this increased complexity here .    when the value of @xmath36 is decreased below 1 ,",
    "the parabolic points disappear and no low - order periodic points are found in the flow .",
    "we have searched numerically for periodic orbits by iteratively mapping regions of the flow forward and backward in time .",
    "for example , the poincar section shown in figure  [ fig : poin_101](d ) for @xmath99 appears to be completely chaotic .",
    "thus , there are no apparent periodic ` ghost rods ' available to form a braid and predict a lower bound on the topological entropy of the flow .",
    "however , figure  [ fig : entropy ] shows that @xmath100 is a lower bound for @xmath89 for approximately a @xmath101 perturbation in @xmath36@xcite . in the discussion",
    "below , we consider the validity of the topological entropy predicted by tnct even if we can not identify exactly periodic orbits that produce the expected braiding motion .",
    "we accomplish this by using a transfer operator approach to reveal phase space structures that braid non - trivially and persist under perturbations in the @xmath36 values .",
    "we use a set - oriented method to compute aiss for the lid - driven cavity flow system .",
    "our aim is to partition the phase space into a given number ( say @xmath5 ) of sets @xmath102 such that the phase space transport between these sets is very unlikely .",

    "we take 100 uniformly distributed points in each box ( a 10@xmath13510 grid ) , perform a forward iteration for each point for one period of the flow @xmath36 , and monitor the boxes reached by the iteration . the transition probability from a source box to a destination box",
    "is measured by the ratio of the number of points from the source box that reach the destination box in one iteration step .",
    "all subsequent computations were verified to depend weakly on the number of points per box ( for values greater than 100 ) by comparing the results with those obtained when using 2025 points per box ( a 45@xmath13545 grid ) instead of 100 , with the difference in the various eigenvalues for the two cases being less than @xmath136 for the range of parameters considered here .",
    "similarly , a finer discretization of phase space , obtained by using 30000 boxes ( @xmath137 boxes ) was used to verify the convergence of eigenvalues .",
    "it was also verified that finer discretization does not change the order of the eigenvectors .",
    "the system being considered here is a canonical hamiltonian system , and thus the invariant measure , @xmath105 , is the same as volume measure , @xmath116 . as our boxes are of equal sizes , the entries of @xmath119 should be approximately equal .",
    "we note that the invariant measure is not unique in our case , since a point measure at the periodic points ( if any ) will also be invariant .",

    "the eigenvector that has @xmath75 acs components , and hence forms an @xmath75-stranded braid , is referred to as an @xmath75-stranded eigenvector in our discussion .",
    "each ( positive ) lower eigenvalue has an associated eigenvector whose zero contour isolates other ais , which are more ` leaky ' , i.e. , the lower the eigenvalue , the lower is the invariance of the associated ais . for reference , we show the next 4 eigenvectors in figure [ fig : modes3to6 ] , which tend to reveal smaller scale structures .",
    "recall from section [ sec : cases ] that while the three period-3 fixed points cease to exist for @xmath168 ( see figure [ fig : poin_101](d ) ) , we can see from figure [ fig : tau_cric ] that the three acs , each of period-3 , still exist in the same region in phase space for @xmath169 .",
    "in what follows , we examine the trajectories of these sets in space - time in order to determine if the corresponding braid is of pa type .",
    "we use @xmath170 for our analysis in this case . to construct the physical braid for the acs trajectories , we form a discretized family of time - shifted versions of the transfer operator @xmath171 for @xmath172 , where @xmath173 .",
    "that is , we are considering transfer operators corresponding to a family of period-@xmath36 flow maps , ( [ flowmap ] ) , i.e. , @xmath174 of different initial phases @xmath175 .    for each of the corresponding @xmath176 , we find the almost - invariant structure based on the second eigenvector as mentioned previously , which reveals the three period-3 acs for @xmath170 .",
    "we take @xmath177 , and in figure [ fig:3dbraid](a - f ) we show these structures for the first half - period of the flow .",
    "this physical braid for this half - period of motion corresponds to the mathematical braid generator @xmath78 .",
    "similarly , for the second half of the time - period of the flow ( not shown ) , the stirring protocol is the one given by the braid generator @xmath74 .",
    "hence , the physical braid formed by the acs trajectories for @xmath170 is represented by the mathematical braid @xmath178 , which is identical to the mathematical braid formed by periodic points for @xmath61 or by elliptical islands for @xmath179 .",
    "three periods of the flow ( one period of the braid ) are shown in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional space - time in figure [ fig:3dbraid](g ) , which can be seen to be isotopic to the braid shown in figure [ cavity_flow_streamlines](c ) . hence the lower bound on topological entropy",
    "is again given by @xmath180 , and we can see from figure [ fig : entropy ] that this lower bound is still valid .",
    "as the parameter @xmath36 is varied , one expects to see continuous variation in the eigenvalues of @xmath121 .",
    "since the eigenvalues of @xmath121 are independent of the phase @xmath45 , we can consider the initial phase case , @xmath181 .",
    "in figure [ fig : eigenvalue_bifurcation ] , we plot the first few eigenvalues of @xmath181 in dependence on the parameter @xmath36 , similar to @xcite .    .",
    "the structures shown in ( a ) and ( b ) can clearly be seen to again have 3 strands .",
    "the structure in ( c ) consists of 16 strands , while ( d ) can be seen to have 13 strands .",
    "( e ) has 10 strands while ( f ) consists of 8 clearly identifiable strands .",
    "also shown are the four largest eigenvalues of the reversibilized discretized transfer operator @xmath181 ( except 1 ) , @xmath182 , which are colored according to their ordering .",
    "one of these is singled out as the @xmath183 branch ( shown with large squares ) , which is the eigenvalue corresponding to @xmath184 , the continuous eigenvector family of interest ( see text for details ) . ]",
    "although several ` crossings ' of eigenvalue curves seem visible , care must be taken to determine if these are genuine crossings or simply close approaches , as eigenvalues generically ` avoid ' crossings if there is no symmetry present @xcite .",
    "our concern is not necessarily to resolve families of eigenvalue curves , i.e. , to determine whether genuine eigenvalue curve crossings occur .",
    "instead , we are interested in determining families of eigenvectors by the method of continuation .",
    "in particular , we want to determine the family of eigenvectors that generate a consistent trend of pa braiding for @xmath185 .",
    "we find that such a structure can be found by continuity of the branch of eigenvectors of @xmath181 that are connected to @xmath140 of @xmath186 , since @xmath140 of @xmath186 captures the braiding structure correctly for the reference case .",
    "the continuation of this 3-strand eigenvector for @xmath153 is carried out as follows .",
    "first , we discretize the parameter space @xmath187 into intervals of size @xmath188 .",
    "then we calculate the reversibilized perron - frobenius operator @xmath181 for each of those parameter values .",
    "we compute the top 10 non - trivial eigenvectors ( normalized to unity ) @xmath189 for each @xmath36 .",
    "our aim is to identify an eigenvector for each @xmath36 that can be used to obtain an ais whose corresponding acss give a braiding structure similar to the reference case .",
    "we denote this eigenvector by @xmath190 . by definition , for @xmath61 the eigenvector that gives the relevant braiding structure is the second eigenvector , thus @xmath191 .",
    "we calculate the inner product of @xmath192 with each of the 10 eigenvectors of the next lowest @xmath36 value , i.e. , @xmath193 , and we compute the absolute value of the inner product , @xmath194 , for @xmath195 .",
    "we select the eigenvector @xmath196 that gives the highest value of @xmath197 , and refer to this eigenvector as @xmath198 .",
    "we denote this value as @xmath199 , i.e. , @xmath200 .",
    "similarly , this procedure is carried out for @xmath201 by taking the norm of the inner products with @xmath202 , and so on .",
    "using this procedure , we make some observations based on figure [ fig : eigenvalue_bifurcation ] .",
    "the ais structure consisting of 3 acss seems to persist until @xmath203 .",
    "we also observe that as the value of @xmath36 decreases further , the structure consisting of 3 acss starts breaking up , and at @xmath204 a structure consisting of 16 acss can be seen , as shown in figure [ fig : eigenvalue_bifurcation](c ) . further decreasing @xmath95 produces another change in the ais structure , and figure [ fig : eigenvalue_bifurcation](d ) shows an ais with 13 acss .",
    "moving further to the left on the @xmath36 axis , we see ais structures with 10 and 8 acss in figures [ fig : eigenvalue_bifurcation](e ) and [ fig : eigenvalue_bifurcation](f ) , respectively .",
    "this break - up of the ais structure can be better understood by plotting the @xmath199 values , shown in figure [ fig : dotprod ] .     for a range of @xmath36 values ( black curve ) .",
    "the regions where this value stays almost constant are the regions of persistence of different braiding structures , separated by transition regions where the value drops significantly .",
    "the topological entropy of the flow , @xmath89 , computed by line stretching , reproduced from figure [ fig : entropy ] , is shown in red .",
    "the lower bounds computed by the tnct for the braids generated by the acss in that parameter range are shown in blue in the relevant regions.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    the @xmath199 value measures the closeness of the eigenvectors along the @xmath205 branch for two nearby @xmath36 values , and hence captures changes in the eigenvector morphology .",
    "we observe that in regions where we can clearly identify the different ais structures consisting of 3 , 16 , 13 , 10 or 8 acss , the value of @xmath199 remains almost constant . on the other hand , in the transition regions where there is no clearly distinguishable ais structure",
    "there is a sharp drop in the @xmath199 value , signifying a significant change in the structure of the eigenvector .",
    "intuitively , this behavior of @xmath199 means that the ais structure persists for a range of @xmath36 and then undergoes a transition ( or bifurcation ) into another ais structure . comparing figure [ fig : eigenvalue_bifurcation ] with figure [ fig : dotprod ] , we see that the dips in the graph of @xmath199 versus @xmath36 seem to accurately capture the boundaries of different ais structures and transition regions .",
    "the acs found using the above method can each be identified with a braid , with the number of strands in the braid corresponding to the number of acs in the domain .",
    "for parameter ranges over which @xmath199 remains essentially constant , we find that the number of strands in each braid remains constant and the braids are isotopic to each other .",
    "we also find that dips in the value of @xmath199 correspond to changes in the number of strands in the representative braid and changes in the braid topology .",
    "we determine the space - time braid structure produced by the acss in each case by computing the time - shifted transfer operators as was done for the braid on 3 strands in the previous subsection .",
    "consider the case @xmath206 , for which the acss form a 13-stranded braid . in figure  [ fig:13braid_evecs ]",
    ", we show the time - shifted eigenvectors at several different times during the first half - period of the flow , and we illustrate the motion of the 13 strands during one full period of the flow in figure  [ 13braid_illus ] .",
    "the overall structure of the braid consists of four strands each on the left and right of the domain , and five strands in the middle . during the first half - period , strands b1 through b4 move together to the right while c1 through c4 move to the left , similar to the @xmath207 motion of the middle and right strands in the reference case , but strand b5 remains in the middle .",
    "similarly , during the second half - period , strand c1 remains in the middle , while c2 through c4 and b5 move to the left .",
    "this motion of the acs gives rise to the physical braid representation shown in figure [ fig : braid_rep](a ) , which can be written as @xmath208 , where    @xmath209    is the braid over the first half period of the flow , and @xmath210    is the braid over the second half period .",
    "all strands return to their original positions after 13 periods of the flow .",
    "this motion is hence topologically distinct from the 3-stranded reference braid shown in figures  [ cavity_flow_streamlines](c ) and [ fig:3dbraid](g ) .",
    "the lower bound on the topological entropy of this braid is @xmath211 , which is lower than @xmath212 for the reference case .         +    over the range of parameters considered here , @xmath213 , we find that decreasing @xmath95 from unity gives acss that generate braids on 3 , 16 , 13 , 10 , and 8 strands , successively .",
    "the physical braid representations are shown in figure [ fig : braid_rep ] , and the corresponding braid words are given in the appendix .",
    "the basic behavior in all of the bifurcations tends to follow the pattern discussed in the 13-strand case  one of the strands from the middle of the domain breaks away from the rest of the strands , and hence we get topologically different braiding in each case .",
    "entropy_table ] lists the topological entropy of these braids , and these values are plotted in figure  [ fig : dotprod ] .    .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we see that the lower bounds provided by the tnct for these braids , @xmath214 , are indeed sharp lower bounds on the actual topological entropy for the flow , @xmath215 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath214 is a good estimate of @xmath215 in these cases .",
    "this is a key result and suggests that acs - based topological analysis can be used in the framework of the tnct .",
    "we give numerical evidence that the almost - invariant set theory can be applied in conjunction with the thurston - nielsen classification theorem to find estimates of complexity in a wide class of systems .",
    "we have used almost - invariant sets as central objects in the application of the tnct by looking at non - trivial braids corresponding to the space - time trajectories of these sets .",
    "we demonstrate that this procedure can predict an accurate lower bound on the topological entropy for a flow even in those cases when the system has been perturbed far from one that contains braiding periodic orbits .",
    "this work shows that predictions regarding chaos can be made by considering regions in phase space that move together for a finite amount of time .",
    "this application broadens the scope of problems where such a lower bound can be established and suggests that they should be of use in time varying systems that do not have any well - defined periodic points , such as free surface flows , or in time - independent systems operating in a parameter regime where there do not exist any easily - identifiable fixed points .",
    "we stress the fact that while the tnct can be ( in theory ) applied to any orientation - preserving flow ( on a two - dimensional domain ) that results in a diffeomorphism , the difficulty lies in finding the appropriate isotopy class . in the cases where low - order periodic orbits exist",
    "( and can be found ) , the isotopy class is defined relative to the periodic orbits . in these cases ,",
    "the stretching produced by the tn representative is a strict lower bound on the stretching for any flow in the isotopy class . for the cases in which no obvious , low - order periodic orbits exist and",
    "the braiding is instead identified via almost - cyclic sets , the predictions of stretching are only approximate , since the acss do not rigorously qualify as punctures in phase space .",
    "however , this acs approach identifies a small set of ` approximate punctures ' that give an accurate representation of the topological entropy for the cases we have considered .",
    "the class of set - oriented transfer operator methods discussed in this paper have been applied to systems accessible solely by time series data @xcite , systems with stochasticity @xcite , and non - autonomous systems defined by data over finite time , where finite - time coherent sets become the objects of interest @xcite .",
    "hence , the connection between set - oriented statistical methods and topological methods in dynamical systems made in this paper provides an additional tool for analyzing complex systems , including those defined by data .",
    "ideally , one would want to apply the notion of braiding coherent sets to an experimental setting , where one could ask questions regarding the role of braiding coherent sets in complex physical systems .",
    "for example , what implications does large - scale braiding have for stirring in geophysical flows ?",
    "there is work on spectral analysis of the `` mixing matrix '' @xcite that is closely related to the identification of almost invariant sets and acss , and connections have been made between this mixing matrix analysis and the `` strange eigenmode '' that arises from spectral analysis of the continuous advection - diffusion operator @xcite .",
    "the topological information available from analyzing trajectories of acs suggests that a similar approach can be applied to the braiding of eigenvectors in these related methods .",
    "we note that for the lid - driven cavity system , some dynamical ` memory ' of the saddle point stable and unstable manifolds remains even where _ there are no more saddle points _ ; compare figure [ fig : lobe_dynamics ] , where such objects exist , with the wisp - like features of figures [ fig : tau_cric ] and [ fig : modes3to6 ] , where they do not technically exist .",
    "transfer operator methods seem to reveal structures resembling stable and unstable manifolds of invariant sets , but these are now associated with almost - invariant sets . given the importance of stable and unstable manifolds in applications , future",
    "work could extend this concept of stable and unstable ` almost - invariant manifolds ' to systems that are not exactly periodic , and possibly far from periodic .",
    "for example , in applications to stability and control @xcite , ` almost - invariant manifolds ' may prove useful for geometric interpretations of stable and unstable directions in the phase space .",
    "they may also help in making connections with invariant manifold - like objects detected by other methods ; cf .  figure [ polarvortex ] .",
    "another intriguing possibility is opened up by considering the spectral dependence of transfer operators . even in relatively simple systems such as shown in figure [ fig : eigenvalue_bifurcation ] , one sees interesting changes in the eigenvectors of the discretized perron - frobenius operator as a system parameter is varied",
    ". some modes increase in importance while other modes decrease .",
    "different modes can correspond to dramatically different behavior .",
    "this observation may have an interesting application to systems defined from data :  prediction of dramatic changes in system behavior based on mode variations .",
    "that is , a system may contain hints of a bifurcation before a bifurcation occurs , and this premonition may be teased out via a transfer operator approach , similar to @xcite . to take a vivid example ,",
    "consider figure [ polarvortex ] , where we show the splitting of the ozone hole in 2002 @xcite , which we might classify as a ` duffing bifurcation ' , where the bifurcation parameter is some physical quantity changing slowly with time .",
    "given only the weather observations up to some time , @xmath216 , before the split , e.g. , september 20 , 2002 ( figure [ polarvortex](a , b ) ) , might the spectrum of the discretized perron - frobenius operator reveal an emerging , and topologically distinct , eigenvector which is increasing in importance , soon to become the dominant mode ( figure [ polarvortex](e ) ) ? to determine trends in the change of spectrum of a transfer operator in real - time , one may need to consider the possibility of using the infinitesimal generator of the discretized perron - frobenius operator , which could give several orders of magnitude increase in speed for determining the spectral characteristics @xcite .",
