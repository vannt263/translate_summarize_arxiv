    "graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs ) are atomically thin and only nanometers wide , which makes them the flimsiest materials in the world .",
    "today such ribbons , acclaimed for promising applications , are fabricated in many ways@xcite , and investigated for heat conduction@xcite , edge features@xcite , and electronic characteristics@xcite , among many other properties .",
    "however , since the ribbons are flimsy , they need stabilizing support  although even then ribbons can get folded , torn , rippled , and bent.@xcite    also supports are different , as the interaction with graphene can be either physical or chemical . in physisorption",
    "the support interaction is weak , graphene s electronic structure remains decoupled , and adhesion arises from the dispersive van der waals interactions alone.@xcite in chemisorption the support interaction is stronger , and the presence of chemical bonds alters graphene s electronic structure.@xcite therefore adhesion , responsible for holding ribbons planar , ranges from @xmath0  mev / atom to @xmath1  mev / atom.@xcite however , fabrication processes , surface inhomogeneities , pinning , afm tip manipulation , heat treatment , or mechanical strains can make ribbons subject to gentle bends , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : ribbons](a ) .",
    "indeed , planar and gentle bending can be directly seen in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments.@xcite distortions like twisting , on the contrary , are less relevant on supports.@xcite only gentle bends are interesting , as sharp bends are structurally unstable ( ribbons would desorb and fold instead).@xcite    the purpose of this work , therefore , is to answer the following simple question : what happens to gnrs electronic structure upon planar bending ?",
    "it turns out that simple geometrical arguments , together with nearest ( and next - nearest ) neighbor tight - binding reasoning , are sufficient for a thorough understanding of the electromechanics of bent gnrs .",
    "these insights should hence help interpreting imperfect experiments with these distortion - prone ribbons .     around given origin ( not shown ) .",
    "width @xmath2 is defined by the outmost carbon atoms and @xmath3 is the mean radius of curvature .",
    "the bending parameter of eq.([eq : theta ] ) , here @xmath4 , also equals ( approximately ) to the compressive strain at the inner edge ( @xmath5 ) and to the tensile strain at the outer edge ( @xmath6).,width=302 ]",
    "i modeled gnrs as free - standing , without explicit presence of the support ; it was there merely as a planar constraint .",
    "the underlying justification was to model physisorption where the support and gnr electronic structures are essentially decoupled .",
    "for chemisorption the results are not directly valid .",
    "the focus is on the bent sections of very long ribbons , with bending viewed as a _ local _ property .",
    "apart from bending , planar ribbons can also stretch and shear ; those deformations have been investigated by conventional methods.@xcite the deformation mode certainly depends on the experimental conditions , and especially in short ribbons the strain patterns can become complicated.@xcite however , ribbons yield easily upon lateral forcing , and adjust themselves readily to minimum - energy geometries.@xcite in bent geometries sliding is particularly easy as the ribbon and the support are mostly out of registry .",
    "long ribbons pinned at two distant locations , therefore , can remove high - energy shearing and stretching by sliding , and favor pure bending.@xcite i remark that the central results , as discussed below , will be valid also beyond pure bending .",
    "i modeled the electronic structure by density - functional tight - binding ( dftb ) method@xcite , and the bent geometry itself by revised periodic boundary conditions.@xcite atoms in the simulation cell were from gnr translational cell of length @xmath7 , and the associated symmetry operation was a rotation of an angle @xmath8 around a given origin , as in refs .   and",
    "[ see fig .",
    "[ fig : ribbons](b ) ] .",
    "this means , therefore , that the simulated systems were effectively gnr hoops , containing hundreds of thousands of atoms . since the bends are gentle and the charge transfer with physisorption usually small , it s reasonable to assume that simulation describes the properties of bends in gnrs in a local sense.@xcite at any rate , regarding the bending , simulations were _ exact _ and the sole approximation was the dftb method itself .    throughout this article",
    "i will use the dimensionless parameter @xmath9 to quantify the amount of bending.@xcite then , to simulate gnr of width @xmath2 with bending close to @xmath10 , i chose @xmath11 , with @xmath12 as the initial guess for the radius of curvature , and optimized the structure .",
    "the only fixed parameter was @xmath8 , so @xmath3 and @xmath13 were outcomes of the optimization , although @xmath14 and @xmath15 . here",
    "i remark that , because @xmath8 s are small ( down to @xmath16 radians ) , the optimization was arduous and required maximum force criteria as small as @xmath17  ev /   ( look ref .   to see why ) .",
    "i conducted such simulations for hydrogen - passivated armchair ribbons ( @xmath18-agnrs ) and zigzag ribbons ( @xmath18-zgnrs ) , with @xmath19 , with @xmath2 up to @xmath20   , with @xmath21 different gnrs in total ( see ref .",
    "for gnr notations ) .",
    "each gnr was optimized for @xmath22 bendings between @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the reason for @xmath24 as the upper limit for bending that i term `` gentle '' will be clarified later .",
    "finally , the number of @xmath25-points was @xmath26  @xmath27 for geometry optimization and @xmath28  @xmath27 for electronic structure analysis .     as a function of bending parameter @xmath13 for agnrs ( solid lines ) and for zgnrs ( dashed lines ) ; the bold dashed line is an analytical estimate .",
    "inset : elastic energy density as a function of bending ; the bold dashed line is an analytical estimate , eq.([eq : eavg ] ) . in both plots",
    "the line width is proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "hence both in @xmath29 and in @xmath30 the largest deviations are for the narrowest ribbons.,width=302 ]",
    "let us now turn attention to the results . prior to discussing electronic properties , however , let us first look at energy and geometry .",
    "the energy in bent ribbon , as hinted by nanoshell elasticity@xcite , comes chiefly from axial in - plain strain . a quick estimate yields energy per unit area as @xmath31 , where @xmath32  ev@xmath33 is graphene s in - plane modulus.@xcite this simple estimate is in fair agreement with the simulations , as shown in the inset of fig .  [ fig : energy ] .",
    "only the narrowest ribbons deviate from this estimate , for two reasons : first , the comparison of @xmath2 between atomic and continuum methods is inherently ambiguous ; for small @xmath2 this ambiguity is emphasized .",
    "second , in narrow ribbons the value of @xmath34 is affected by distinct elastic properties near the edges . while i could remedy these deficiencies by improving the model ,",
    "my main interest is not in the minutiae of narrow ribbons , but in the wider ribbons and their universal trends .",
    "if we set the adhesion energy @xmath35 equal to the strain energy , we get @xmath36 as a rough estimate for the limit where the ribbon rather desorbs and straightens than remains adsorbed and bent on the support . the maximum adhesion @xmath37  mev / atom yields @xmath38 , justifying the upper limit @xmath39 for a  gently  bent ribbon , even though @xmath40 really depends on the substrate .",
    "this is only an order - of - magnitude estimate , as fluctuations and finite - size effects can cause ribbons to desorb earlier .",
    "direct experimental evidence@xcite shows how gnrs on sio@xmath41 bend up to @xmath42still nearly half the simple - minded limit of @xmath43 given by @xmath44  mev / @xmath45.@xcite    given the definition for @xmath13 , the strain on ribbon s inner edge is @xmath46 and on the outer edge @xmath47 . with strains around @xmath22",
    "%  the bond anharmonicities begin to emerge , and stretching becomes cheaper , compression more expensive .",
    "this implies that the neutral line moves away from the origin ( @xmath3 increases ) and ribbon stretches .",
    "we can take this effect into account by a strain - dependent in - plane modulus , @xmath48 .",
    "then , by minimizing the total energy per unit length @xmath49 with respect to @xmath3 , we obtain the cross - ribbon averaged strain as @xmath50 this analytical estimate , given the value @xmath51 obtained from dftb simulations of stretched gnrs , agrees well with simulations , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] .",
    "the largest deviations occur again for the narrow ribbons , albeit with opposite tendencies for agnrs and zgnrs due to different edge morphologies .",
    "for the three @xmath52-families of agnrs .",
    "line width is proportional to @xmath2 ; dashed lines are estimates for @xmath53 .",

    "equipped with these geometrical notions , let us now turn attention to the electronic properties , starting with agnrs .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : ac](a ) shows the energy gaps for the known three families of @xmath18-agnrs , defined by @xmath58.@xcite the gaps scale as @xmath59 , where @xmath60  ev  for @xmath53 ( for @xmath61 the scaling is bit different ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : ac](a ) shows how these gaps respond to bending : they widen or narrow with the same @xmath52-dependent families .",
    "deviations occur only for the narrowest ribbons .",
    "these trends can be understood by the following model .",
    "the energy gaps in stretched @xmath53 agnrs depend on the strain as @xmath62 with @xmath63 ( fit for @xmath61 is just more complex).@xcite the origin for this strain - dependence is illustrated in fig.[fig : ac](b ) for @xmath54-agnr with @xmath55 : the highest occupied orbital is bonding and the lowest unoccupied orbital is antibonding along the ribbon s axis , and therefore stretching tends to narrow the gap ( for @xmath64 agnrs the situation is the opposite and for @xmath61 intermediate).@xcite next , if we pretend , in effect , that the bent agnrs experience only the _ average _ axial strain ( even if the strain is uneven ) , and thus juxtapose @xmath65 with @xmath29 from eq.([eq : eavg ] ) , we get @xmath66 figure  [ fig : ac](a ) plots these estimates for @xmath64 and @xmath55 agnrs by the dashed lines .",
    "the fair agreement suggests that the electronic structure of agnrs subject to bending is _ dominated by the cross - ribbon averaged strain_. similar physics has been observed previously in bent carbon nanotubes and twisted gnrs.@xcite hence the argument is easily generalized to combined bending and stretching , where the electronic structure is modified by the average strain @xmath67.@xcite    these trends , as given by four - valence dftb , are reproduced by a @xmath68-only tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath69 with the nearest - neighbor ( n.n . )",
    "hopping parameter @xmath70 and with the next - nearest neighbor hopping equal to zero ( @xmath71 , not shown ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : ac](c ) shows further that the stretching analogy extends beyond energy gaps , as the entire density of states ( dos ) is well described by the stretched geometry .",
    "this carries the average strain analogy also for optical transitions , as shown earlier.@xcite note that , if gauged through the relative gap change @xmath72 , the influence of bending becomes more important as @xmath2 increases .",
    "let us now leave agnrs and turn our attention to the electronic properties of zgnrs .",
    "first i have to remind that , for straight zgnrs as such , the spin - parallel dftb simulations are dubious , given the prediction for a spin - polarized ground state.@xcite the magnetic structure should arise when the curious flat bands near the fermi - level@xcite [ left panel of fig.[fig : zz](a)]the famous edge states ",
    "spin - polarize , lift degeneracies , and open a gap ( not shown).@xcite this way spontaneous magnetization can stabilize the electronic structure .",
    "-zngr with a straight and bent geometries . for the straight ribbon ,",
    "having a reflection symmetry , the dashed lines denote symmetric and solid lines denote antisymmetric states under reflection .",
    "( for the bent ribbons no such distinction can be made . )",
    "( b ) wave functions of the frontier orbitals in straight @xmath22-zgnr : highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo , symmetric ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo , antisymmetric ) .",
    "( c ) density of states in straight and bent @xmath22-zgnr .",
    "the dashed lines are from a next - nearest neighbor tight - binding model [ eq.([eq : h ] ) with eq.([eq : tp ] ) ] .",
    "inset : gaps for all zgnrs plotted as a function of @xmath73 ( @xmath74 when @xmath75).,width=302 ]    it has been shown that , unlike in agnrs@xcite , the electronic structure in zgnrs is unaffected by stretching.@xcite therefore , after discovering above the average - strain argument with agnrs , it s natural to guess that bending would leave zgnrs electronic structure unaffected .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : zz](a ) shows , however , that _ bending can open an energy gap in zgnrs_. that is , electronic structure is stabilized by sheer bending , and the cause for magnetic spin - polarization is lost .",
    "note how the band structure changes only near the fermi - level , while other bands remain stable .",
    "the mechanism of the gap opening is related to broken reflection symmetry , as clarified by the following three - step reasoning : first step ; the bands are called  flat  because they have small dispersion . in the absence of next - nearest neighbor hopping ( @xmath71 ) , the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) gives edge states whose dispersion and energy are essentially zero , independent of @xmath76 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : zz](b ) , where flat band electrons appear localized to next - nearest neighbor sites , separated by vacancies . therefore the @xmath76 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : t ] ) , even if strain - dependent , does nt affect the flat bands  splitting and dispersion hence require next - nearest neighbor hopping @xmath77 .",
    "second step ; fitting @xmath77 to strained gnrs by dftb gives @xmath78 the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) , with hoppings ( [ eq : t ] ) and ( [ eq : tp ] ) , reproduces the electronic structure fairly well , as shown by the dos for @xmath22-zgnr in fig .  [ fig : zz](c ) . [ pure stretching leaves dos intact ( not shown ) ] .",
    "third step ; the flat band energies ( also the band dispersion ) are proportional to @xmath77 and hence proportional to edge strain via eq.([eq : tp ] ) . upon bending ,",
    "the reflection symmetry breaks and states localize on either of the edges with strain difference @xmath79 ; opposite edges hence get unequal hoppings @xmath80 . because energy splitting is proportional to @xmath81 , it is also proportional to @xmath13 .",
    "this is the mechanism how bending splits the flat bands with direct proportionality to @xmath13 .    as mentioned above ,",
    "since @xmath77 gives flat bands a small dispersion , splitting does not open the gap immediately .",
    "when @xmath2 increases , the span of the flat region in @xmath82-space increases , and gap opening requires larger splitting .",
    "a fit to all zgnrs yields a critical value for opening a gap as @xmath83  nm ( or @xmath84  nm for all @xmath2 ) , yielding the energy gap as @xmath85 the gaps , displaying values up to @xmath86  ev , are plotted in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : zz](c ) .",
    "the physics in agnrs and zgnrs appear hence quite different : agnrs are governed by average strain , whereas zgnrs are governed by broken reflection symmetry .",
    "the effects of broken symmetry on agnrs or average strain on zgnrs surely exist , but they are just less important",
    ". in zgnrs bending can have particular impact on transport , since the localization of edge states depends on the direction of bending ; if ribbon has bends both to the left and to the right , the current - carrying electrons need to jump from one edge to the other , suggesting width - dependent resistivity.@xcite although it s plausible that bent zgnrs indeed acquire gaps and turn nonmagnetic , spin - polarized calculations would be opportune , even if the existence of magnetism has been disputed also for the straight ribbons.@xcite    i obtained similar results also for unpassivated gnrs , observing similar phenomena .",
    "thus it appears that these clear trends arise from simple physics with plausible explanations , and it s unlikely that , say , higher level electronic structure methods should change the picture .",
    "i believe , therefore , that these general trends are helpful enough to serve as rules of thumb to aid gnr device fabrication and analysis ."
