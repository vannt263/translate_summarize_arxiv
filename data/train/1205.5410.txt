    "sigma ( @xmath0 ) phase was found in over 40 binary alloys and many other three- or multi - component alloy systems @xcite .",
    "the phase can not be formed at the stage of solidification of the solution of alloying elements .",
    "instead , it can only be obtained by a high temperature annealing process ( solid state reaction ) . from the viewpoint of technological applications of alloys ,",
    "the @xmath0-phase should be avoided as its presence drastically deteriorates different mechanical properties of materials in which it precipitates",
    ". a better knowledge of conditions of its formation may be helpful for fabrications of materials in which the unwanted phase does not precipitate or its precipitatioin is significantly retarded .",
    "on the other hand , due to its complexity ( 30 atoms per unit cell , five different sublattices , high ( 12 - 15 ) coordination numbers , and lack of a stoichiometry ) make the @xmath0-phase a very challending object for theoretical calculations .",
    "they are very helpful for a proper interpretation of measurements , especially those done by means of microscopic methods like mssbauer spectroscopy or nuclear magnetic resonance , as well as for a better understanding of the results obtained .",
    "@xcite    in the fe - v system the @xmath0-phase can be formed by an isothermal annealing of the _ bcc_-master alloys in a wide range of concentration ( @xmath5 at.% v ) and temperature ( @xmath6c ) @xcite .",
    "once formed , it  remains stable at lower temperatures , but it can be dissolved into the @xmath7-phase at temperatures above @xmath8c .",
    "mechanism of its formation as well as that of its dissolution is not known with sufficient precision yet .",
    "knowledge of the energy of its formation compared to the energy of formation of the @xmath7-phase ( from which it precipitates ) may help to better understand processes responsible for its formation and dissolution .",
    "thus , it may be useful in a fabrication of a new generation of materials , like stainless steels , having suitable properties for a construction of new generations of industrially important facilities .    having a tetragonal unit cell and hosting 30 atoms distributed over five crystallographically non - equivalent sites ( usually termed a through e ) this phase remains still challenging for theoretical calculations .",
    "luckily , increase of computing capabilities of modern computers makes it possible that more sophisticated models can be applied to more adequately and precisely describe the complex structure and properties of the @xmath0-phase @xcite .",
    "the present analysis of the structural stability of the @xmath0-phase was based on electronic structure calculations , similar to the methodology applied for @xmath0-fev and @xmath0-fecr alloy systems to study hyperfine interactions @xcite as well as the formation energy for the latter @xcite .",
    "we have employed the korringa - kohn - rostoker ( kkr ) technique @xcite to calculate the electronic structure and the total energy in the framework of the non - relativistic lda theory and using the muffin - tin approximation for a crystal potential .",
    "more computational details on @xmath9phase can be found in refs . and .",
    "since in the real structure of @xmath0-fev all five crystallographic sites are occupied by both types of atoms , a chemical disorder on these sublattices must be taken into account . a more sophisticated approach based on the kkr method with the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) , allowing to treat the disorder as random ,",
    "should be capable of accounting for @xmath10 atomic configurations , a target that still remains unreachable . in these circumstances , an alternative , but a feasible approach consists in selection of some ordered elementary unit cells with different configurations of atoms on the five sublattices , which permits to use the kkr method ( instead of kkr - cpa one ) . in practice ,",
    "the electronic structure calculations were performed for a finite number of the unit cells with a symmetry reduced to a simple tetragonal one ( p1 instead of p4@xmath11/mnm ) , in which each position ( but not the sublattice ) was occupied by one type of atoms ( fe or v ) .",
    "the atoms were distributed over the five different sites with the probabilities determined from neutron diffraction measurements @xcite which were next altered in the way described below .",
    "differences between total energies ( per atom ) , @xmath1 ( usually called the formation energy ) , determined for each of these atomic configurations , @xmath12 , and corresponding values obtained for pure constituents , i.e. _ bcc_-fe and _ bcc_-v , @xmath13 , could be calculated @xcite according to eq .",
    "( [ eqrs ] ) : @xmath14 where @xmath15 stands for the concentration of v. they can be further presented in form of a diagram as a function of concentration of the alloying elements .",
    "this approach was already successfully applied to the analysis of the formation energy of the @xmath0-phase in the fe - cr alloy system @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , the @xmath0-phase is characterized by a chemical disorder on all five sublattices , and the concentrations of fe / v atoms on each of them were determined experimentally @xcite .",
    "since both fe and v atoms are present on all five sublattices , it is useful for further considerations to introduce shortened notations for samples with different sublattice occupancies .",
    "multiplicity ( denoted by @xmath16 ) of the five wyckoff positions , namely 2a , 4f , 8i , 8i and 8j correspond to a , b , c , d and e site , respectively .",
    "since the total number of atoms on each of the five sublattices was already known , thus it was enough to indicate the number of the fe atoms on each sublattice explicitly , while the v atoms constitute the balance .",
    "according to this convention , an illustrative example of @xmath0 - 20172 describes a system comprising 2 , 1 , 7 , and 2 atoms of fe on the sites a , c , d and e , respectively , and also 4 , 7 , 1 and 6 atoms of v atoms on the sites b , c , d and e.    in the present work we analyzed more carefully ordered unit cells corresponding to the following atomic configurations : @xmath0 - 20172 , @xmath0 - 20383 and @xmath0 - 21485 .",
    "the total number of fe atoms in them is 12 , 16 and 20 , respectively .",
    "the three configurations have been chosen intentionally to best approximate experimentally investigated samples viz .",
    "fe@xmath17v@xmath18 , fe@xmath19v@xmath20 and fe@xmath21v@xmath22 , respectively @xcite .",
    "these three cases correspond to the border and middle compositions of the @xmath0-phase existence on the phase diagram of the fe - v alloy system @xcite . actually , we treated these configurations as the reference for a further analysis of @xmath1 .",
    "in the next step we have calculated the @xmath1-values , for the unit cells changed ( with respect to the three reference ones ) by a replacement of one or two atoms exclusively on the same site .",
    "ten ordered approximants of each configuration of sublattice occupancies with different atomic arrangements were analyzed , and average @xmath1-values , obtained in this approach for neighborhoods of the three reference configurations , are presented as a function of fe atoms number per unit cell , @xmath23 ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "simultaneously , the @xmath1-changes caused by the replacements of atoms on each sublattice are indicated with various colors .",
    "-phase , @xmath1 , for the chosen three basic atomic configurations and its neighborhood , versus the number of fe atoms per unit cell , @xmath23 ( v concentration is also indicated ) .",
    "solid lines stand for the best fit to the data - see appendix .",
    "@xmath1-values determined for occupation changes ( with respect to the reference configurations ) on the five lattice sites are indicated by different colors . ]",
    "the changes of @xmath1 in the vicinity of the three reference configurations are fairly linear functions of @xmath23 for the sites a , b , c , and d , and rather non - linear for the site e. the slopes of the lines for the sites a , b and c are characteristic of the site and equal -0.021(1 ) , 0.025(1 ) and 0.019(1 ) - in ev / atom - respectively .",
    "interestingly , these slopes are more or less the same for all reference configurations ( see , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , while for the site d the value of the slope depends on the alloy basic configuration around which it is calculated ( changes from -0.022 for @xmath0 - 20172 to -0.009 ev / atom for @xmath0 - 21485 ) .",
    "@xmath1 corresponding to the changes on the site e departs from linearity and can be approximated using a second - order polynomial of the fe - concentration on this site .",
    "the model used for the formation energy calculation allowed to determine the values of @xmath1 only for such cases , in which individual sites ( but not sublattices ) are occupied by just one type of atoms .",
    "this really corresponds to a one selected unit cell , whereas in the neighboring cells atoms may be arranged in a somewhat different way on the sublattices . for that reason , for a more realistic description of crystalline samples",
    "it is more convenient to operate with the average formation energy that corresponds to the average occupancy of the sublattices by the alloying elements . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , @xmath1 have been determined for almost 50 different configurations of fe and v atoms , including - to some extend - the chemical disorder on the sublattices .",
    "the relatively simple character of the @xmath1-changes described above ( mostly linear behavior ) , provides a possibility of determining a dependence of @xmath1 on the fe - concentrations , @xmath24 , @xmath25a through e , on each sublattice .",
    "it can be achieved by approximation of @xmath1 using a function depending on the variables @xmath24 , on five individual sites , @xmath26 .",
    "taking into account the established character of the @xmath1-changes , there were assumed to be linear ( a trough d sites ) , and quadratic ( e site ) dependences on @xmath24 ( see appendix ) .",
    "fitting such - defined functions to the calculated @xmath1-values ( using the least - square method ) yielded numerical values of polynomial coefficients .",
    "consequently , it allowed to determine @xmath1 for any atomic configuration for all five sites in the @xmath0-fev structure .",
    "bearing in mind that the aforementioned total energy @xmath27 and the electronic structure analysis correspond , in principle , to ground state properties , one can attempt to discuss crystal stability at finite temperature @xmath28 , applying commonly used scheme based on a computation of the free energy , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 stays for an entropy . considering the process of the @xmath0-phase formation",
    ", one can discuss @xmath31 , being the difference between the free energy of @xmath0-fev alloy and free energies of its constituents ( namely , weighted contributions of a pure @xmath32 fe and v which are already known ) .",
    "the total entropy that actually should be taken into account in the present case has several contributions , namely : magnetic entropy , @xmath33 , configuration entropy , @xmath4 , electronic entropy , @xmath34 , and phonon entropy , @xmath35 .",
    "the first two terms could be computed , and the results of these computations are shown in fig .",
    "2 , for the magnetic entropy , and in fig .",
    "3 , for the configuration one .    , calculated versus the number of fe atoms per unit cell , @xmath23 , for different atomic configurations ( samples ) of the @xmath0-fev .",
    "the concentration of vanadium is indicated , too .",
    "solid lines stand for the best fit to the data - see appendix .",
    "@xmath33-values determined for occupation changes on the individual lattice site are indicated by different colors . ]    using the magnetic moments maximum saturation entropy for each atom on the sublattice , @xmath36 , can be determined @xcite . in this work",
    "@xmath33-values were calculated according to the following eq .",
    "( [ eqsm ] ) : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath39 stands for the occupancy of fe on each sublattice , @xmath40 is the average magnetic moment of fe / v atoms belonging to this sublattice and summation ( @xmath41-index ) runs over all five sublattices i.e. from a to e. @xmath40-values for each sublattice and different @xmath24 configurations were obtained from the electronic structure kkr calculations .",
    "2 gives a clear evidence that for each sample @xmath33 increases with @xmath23 for each lattice site .",
    "the increase of the magnetic entropy remains in line with our previous calculations reporting that the magnetic moments ( also the hyperfine fields ) at particular sites increase with @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "similarly to the @xmath1 expression , @xmath33 can be represented as a function of @xmath24 , @xmath42 .",
    "although changes in @xmath33 due to changes in the individual site occupancies are monotonic , however , they deviate slightly from linearity . to approximate the @xmath33 dependence on @xmath24",
    ", we assumed a mathematical form of the function analogous to that used for @xmath1 ( see appendix ) .",
    "the numerical values of the polynomial coefficients were determined by fitting the function to the calculated @xmath33-values .    , calculated versus the number of fe atoms per unit cell , @xmath23 , for different atomic configurations of the @xmath0-fev .",

    "@xmath4-values determined for the occupation changes at each lattice site are plotted using different colors . ]",
    "the configuration entropy , shown in fig .",
    "3 , was calculated according to eq .",
    "( [ eqsc ] ) : @xmath43 it shows a strong dependence on the site for each of three basic configurations .",
    "the dependence is very similar for the sites a , b and c , while @xmath4 for the other two sites i.e. d and e depends on @xmath23 in a way characteristic of the reference configuration .",
    "[ eqsc ] shows that the configuration entropy , @xmath4 , can be easily calculated for any concentration of atoms on all sites , @xmath44 .",
    ", versus temperature , @xmath28 .",
    "the solid lines indicate the calculated values for different compositions of the @xmath0-fe@xmath45v@xmath46 with @xmath15 ranging from 33 to 60 ( the curves from top to bottom correspond to alloys with increasing @xmath15 ) .",
    "the vertical bars indicate experimentally found values of @xmath47 in the same concentration range . ]",
    "the knowledge of @xmath1 , @xmath33 and @xmath4 for any concentration of fe in the sublattices allows to specify a formula describing a change of the free energy , @xmath48 for any concentration of the alloying elements , and any temperature , @xmath49 .",
    "determination of the lowest value of this function for the given temperature and concentration , allowed to determine sublattice occupancies , @xmath39 at the temperature @xmath28 and fe - concentration @xmath50 ( where @xmath16 denotes the occupation number for the sublattice @xmath41 ) .",
    "the @xmath39-values calculated for some chosen concentrations are shown in fig . 4 for the temperature ranging between 0 and 1800 k. at the first glace , one notices a significant site preference for the occupancies in the investigated phase .",
    "in particular , one can clearly see that the fe occupancy of the sites a and d is actually complete and independent of the concentration and temperature .",
    "the occupancy variation with @xmath15 and @xmath28 is significantly larger for the other sites .",
    "it was found that increasing of @xmath51 in the alloy results in an increase of fe content mainly on the sites c and e. for the latter , one can observe the highest sensitivity to temperature ( @xmath52 decreases with temperature ) in comparison to much slower variations revealed for b and c site occupancies ( that increase with temperature ) .",
    "it should be noted that the entropy contribution that predominantly effects the sublattice occupancies is the configuration entropy term .",
    "neglecting @xmath33 in the calculation of @xmath47 , depending on @xmath15 and @xmath28 as shown in fig .",
    "4 , leads to very small changes .",
    "it becomes clear when accounting for a similarity of all individual curves presented in fig .",
    "2 . there , @xmath33 curves vary mainly with the total concentration of fe / v atoms , and are very similar for all sublattices .",
    "this means that this form of the entropy does not substantially affect the site preferences .",
    "the solid lines ( fig .",
    "4 ) indicate the @xmath47-values calculated for different compositions of the @xmath0-fe@xmath45v@xmath46 with @xmath15 ranging from 33 to 60 ( full range of @xmath0-fev occurrence ) .",
    "vertical bars - marked in the plots - indicate values of @xmath47 as determined at rt , but for the samples transformed to the @xmath0-phase at 1300 k ( that is why the bars are marked at this temperature in the plot ) . as the figure shows , the site occupancies calculated by the minimization of the free energy fairly agree with the values obtained from the neutron diffraction experiments .",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment is less satisfying for the site e , since the calculated @xmath47-curves span over a wider range than the the width of the corresponding bar .",
    "the discrepancy observed between the calculated and experimental @xmath47-values is likely due to several factors .",
    "one of them is the simplified model used for the entropy calculations viz . without taking into account the phonon and the electron entropy terms .",
    "however , a possible influence of these terms on final results seems to be rather small as previously found from the formation energy analysis of the @xmath0-phase in the fe - cr alloy system @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , we are not aware of any literature data reporting vibrational properties of the @xmath9fev that would allow to estimate the @xmath35 contribution .",
    "on the other hand , bearing in mind a similarity of atomic and lattice parameters for fe - v and fe - cr @xmath0-phases , it seems reasonable to assume that the @xmath35 contribution to the total entropy is also small in the present case .",
    "the effect of the @xmath34 term was not taken into account mostly due to the fact that our discussion was focused on temperatures @xmath53 k that are far above the debye temperature of the investigated samples ( @xmath54 k @xcite ) .",
    "another factor that could be responsible for the discrepancy between the calculated and the experimental @xmath47 - values is the assumed form ( polynomials ) of the functions for the @xmath1 and @xmath33 ( hence , in consequence that of @xmath55 ) .",
    "better fits were obtained by increasing the degree of the used polynomials , but in that case the discrepancy was not improved .",
    "the formation energy , @xmath1 , magnetic , @xmath3 , and configuration , @xmath4 , entropy contributions were calculated and analyzed in the full range of the fev-@xmath0-phase existence using the electronic band structure calculations by means of the kkr method . it was found that @xmath1-values strongly depend on the fe concentration , and their variation observed for different site occupancies is characteristic of a given lattice site .",
    "the changes also strongly depend on the number of fe atoms on the sites .",
    "similar , increasing dependence on the sample s composition exhibits the @xmath3 term , but for a given composition it weakly depends on the lattice site .",
    "on the other hand , the composition dependence of the @xmath4 term was found to be weak , although for a given composition , @xmath4 , shows well - defined dependence on the lattice site , and for each site , a rather strong dependence on the number of fe atoms occupying the site .",
    "the sublattice occupancies were determined for various compositions and temperatures by minimizing the free energy .",
    "the occupancies of a and d sites were found to be almost independent of @xmath28 and @xmath15 , while the occupancies of the sites b , c and d showed a higher sensitivity to @xmath28 and @xmath15 .",
    "the kkr calculations combined with the analysis of the entropy contributions clearly showed that fe atoms preferably occupy a and d sites in the fev-@xmath0 phase .",
    "this agrees well with the neutron diffraction measurements , and it confirms the general observation for @xmath0 in binary alloy systems that the smaller atoms ( in this case fe ) tend to mostly reside on the sites having the shortest distance to the nearest - neighbors ( a and d ) , while the bigger atoms ( here v ) prefer to occupy the sites having more fee space to accommodate them ( b , c , e ) .",
