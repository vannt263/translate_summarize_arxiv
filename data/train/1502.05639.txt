    "drift - diffusion approximations are widely employed @xcite , since they do not require large computational resources but still describe the main transport phenomena . in this paper",

    "before we explain the model equations , we sketch the state of the art in spinorial drift - diffusion modeling .",
    "the existing drift - diffusion models can be classified into two main groups .",
    "the first group is given by two - component drift - diffusion equations for the spin - up and spin - down densities .",

    "a quantum correction of bohm potential type was derived in @xcite .",
    "the second group consists of spin - vector drift - diffusion models in which the spin variable is a vector quantity . combining the charge density with the spin - vector density",

    "these models can be derived from the spinor boltzmann equation by assuming a moderate spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "projecting the spin - vector density in the direction of the precession vector , we recover the two - component drift - diffusion system as a special case . in @xcite ,",
    "the scattering rates are supposed to be scalar quantities .",
    "assuming that the scattering rates are positive definite hermitian matrices , a more general matrix drift - diffusion model was derived in @xcite .",
    "the global existence of weak solutions to this model was shown in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to analyze an implicit euler finite - volume approximation of the spinorial matrix drift - diffusion model of @xcite and to present some numerical simulations in two space dimensions .",
    "a numerical analysis of a finite - volume scheme of the stationary two - component drift - diffusion equations was performed in @xcite .",

    "* formula ( 1 ) ) ) , @xmath14 is the identity matrix in @xmath15 , @xmath16 denotes the trace of the matrix @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 represents the spin polarization of the scattering rates .",

    "we aim to design a numerical scheme which preserves some qualitative properties of the continuous model , in particular preservation of the positivity of the charge density , boundedness of the density matrix , and dissipation of the free energy .",
    "the main difficulty of the analysis is the strong coupling of the equations ( the diffusion matrix is not diagonal ) , since maximum principle or regularity arguments generally do not apply . the key idea is to introduce two transformations of variables which make the diffusion matrix diagonal and thus reduce the level of coupling .",
    "the first transformation is defined by the spin - up and spin - down densities @xmath43 .",
    "then system - becomes @xmath44 and the boundary conditions , imply @xmath45    we observe that - implies - but not vice versa .",
    "physically this is clear since the spin - up and spin - down densities contain less information than the full density matrix @xmath17 . by the stampacchia truncation method",
    ", the positivity and boundedness of @xmath46 was shown in @xcite , thus giving the positivity and boundedness of the charge density @xmath47 . using the notation @xmath48 , the ( relative ) free energy of the above system",

    "the equation for @xmath53 reads as @xmath54 in @xcite , it was proved by a moser - type iteration technique that @xmath53 is bounded . since @xmath55 is bounded as well ( see above ) , this implies an @xmath0 bound for @xmath30 and consequently for the density matrix @xmath56 .",
    "the task is to `` translate '' these ideas to a finite - volume setting .",
    "we approximate the diffusive and convective part of the fluxes simultaneously by using a scharfetter - gummel discretization .",

    "was shown in @xcite .",
    "the discrete steady states were proved to be bounded @xcite .",
    "discrete entropy ( free energy ) estimates and/or the exponential decay of the free energy along trajectories towards the global equilibrium were investigated in @xcite but still without any spin coupling .",
    "our main results , detailed in section [ sec.nummain ] , are the existence of a bounded discrete solution to a fully discrete finite - volume scheme for - and the monotonicity of the discrete free energy for the spin - up and spin - down densities .",
    "the mathematical challenge is the proof of lower and upper bounds for the discrete densities .",
    "the `` translation '' of the stampacchia truncation argument from the continuous to the discret case in , e.g. , faces some difficulties due to the drift term .",
    "the main difficulty lies in the fact that the monotonicity of the drift term ( with respect to the density variable ) can not be exploited .",
    "therefore , a moser - type iteration method was employed in @xcite .",
    "the idea is to derive a uniform estimate for @xmath53 in the @xmath57 norm of the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes the @xmath60 norm and @xmath61 does not depend on @xmath62 . by gronwall s lemma",
    ", this implies that @xmath63 and the limit @xmath64 shows the claim .",
    "the discrete equivalent of the estimate is @xmath65 where @xmath66 is an approximation of @xmath53 at time @xmath67 and @xmath68 is the ( uniform ) time step size . in order to solve this recursion , we require @xmath69 , thus imposing a condition on the time step size for fixed @xmath70 .",

    ", only those electrons with spin aligned to the drain magnetization can leave the channel and contribute to the current flow . here , we focus on the feasibility of our numerical scheme and the verification of the properties of the numerical solution and less on the physical properties .",

    "the length of the source and drain regions are @xmath435 m .",
    "the gate contacts are attached at the middle of the device with a length of @xmath436 m .",
    "the electrical parameters are : diffusion coefficient @xmath437m@xmath438s@xmath439 , relaxation time @xmath440ps , temperature @xmath441k , and relative permittivity of silicon @xmath442 .",
    "these parameters are similar to those used in @xcite ( there is a small difference in the relaxation time value ) . with these data ,",
    "the scaled debye length is @xmath443 , where @xmath444fm@xmath439 is the permittivity of the vaccum , @xmath445c is the electron charge , and @xmath446m@xmath438kgs@xmath447k@xmath439 is the boltzmann constant .    the gate contact is considered as a schottky contact with barrier potential @xmath448v .",

    "we observe that in the open state ( nonpositive gate potentials ) , the current densities in the ferromagnetic mesfet are slightly larger than in the standard device , which allows for an improved device performance .",

    "the current values stabilize after about 1ps .",
    "this justifies to define the numerical solution after 12ps as the `` steady - state solution '' .",
    "we compare these values with those computed from a standard mesfet ; see figure [ fig.trans1 ] ( right ) .",

    "<S> an implicit euler finite - volume scheme for a spinorial matrix drift - diffusion model for semiconductors is analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> the model consists of strongly coupled parabolic equations for the electron density matrix or , alternatively , of weakly coupled equations for the charge and spin - vector densities , coupled to the poisson equation for the electric potential . </S>",
    "<S> the equations are solved in a bounded domain with mixed dirichlet - neumann boundary conditions . the charge and spin - vector fluxes </S>",
    "<S> are approximated by a scharfetter - gummel discretization . </S>",
    "<S> the main features of the numerical scheme are the preservation of positivity and @xmath0 bounds and the dissipation of the discrete free energy . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of a bounded discrete solution and the monotonicity of the discrete free energy are proved . for undoped semiconductor materials , </S>",
    "<S> the numerical scheme is unconditionally stable . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental ideas are reformulations using spin - up and spin - down densities and certain projections of the spin - vector density , free energy estimates , and a discrete moser iteration . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , numerical simulations of a simple ferromagnetic - layer field - effect transistor in two space dimensions are presented . </S>"
