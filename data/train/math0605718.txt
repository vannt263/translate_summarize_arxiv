    "these estimates involve three exponents which are usually associated to infinite graphs : the _ spectral dimension _ @xmath9",

    "the expression of the generating function of the transition probabilities of the simple random walk on @xmath3 is recalled .    in sections  [ sec : distances ] , [ sec : maxdev ] and [ sec : maxspan ] we prove the asymptotic estimates of the expected value of the distance of the walk from the origin after @xmath0 steps , of its maximal deviation from the origin and of its maximal span respectively .",

    "thus , putting @xmath417 we have that @xmath418 , by fubini and the dominated convergence theorem we get @xmath419 and we are done .",
    "the results of the previous sections show that the random walker on @xmath3 spends most of the time walking along the vertical direction .",
    "one would ask to what extent the resemblance between the simple random walk on @xmath21 and the vertical component of the simple random walk on @xmath3 is apparent .",
    "the answer is that , to leading order , the expected values of the distances after @xmath0 steps of these two walks are indistinguishable . indeed",
    "if we denote by @xmath407 the position at time @xmath0 of the walker on @xmath21 , one could easily compute @xmath420\\stackrel{n\\to\\infty}\\sim \\sqrt{\\frac\\pi2}\\,n^{1/2},\\ ] ] which coincides with the estimate of theorem  [ th : disty ] .",
    "moreover , a comparison between theorem  [ th : mdy ] and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.14 ) and between theorem  [ th : msy ] and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.4 ) shows the same coincidence for the estimates of the maximal deviation and the maximal span respectively .",
    "the inhomogeneity of @xmath3 results in the difference between the behaviour of the horizontal and vertical components of the walk . indeed while for any positive integer @xmath421 the expected value of the distance from the origin of the simple random walker on @xmath422 , after @xmath0 steps , is of order @xmath2 ( this may be easily proven via a conditioning argument , with respect to the proportions of time spent along each of the @xmath421 main directions ) , the expected value of the horizontal distance on @xmath3 is of order @xmath1 , that is on this direction we have a subdiffusive behaviour .",
    "of course this is due to the delay observed on the @xmath5-axis while the walker explores the teeth of the comb ( recall that the simple random walk on @xmath21 , although recurrent , is zero - recurrent , that is the expected value of the first return time to the origin is infinite ) .",
    "the difference between the two projections of the walk is remarkable also when one properly rescales the process as we did in section  [ sec : scaling ] .",
    "indeed the space where the `` rescaled walker '' lives is @xmath423 , endowed with the topology for which any path between two points @xmath424 and @xmath425 must necessarily include the three edges @xmath424@xmath426 , @xmath426@xmath427 and @xmath427@xmath425 .",
    "this reflects on the limiting process : the horizontal component may change only when the vertical one passes through 0 .",
    "in fact , as we proved in theorem [ th : scaling ] , @xmath428 converges to a standard brownian motion @xmath248 , ( the walk on the vertical direction is , to leading order , unaffected by the bias of the random holding time at zero ) , while @xmath429 converges to a brownian motion whose clock is the local time at zero of @xmath248 .",
    "the fact that the walker on @xmath3 essentially behaves like the walker on @xmath21 makes it clear that @xmath430 must be 2 , as we proved by combinatorial methods in section  [ sec : maxdev ] ( note that @xmath431 for all integer @xmath432 ) . indeed it is very likely that the walker will exit the ball of radius @xmath0 moving along some tooth of @xmath3 .",
    "this disproves the einstein relation between @xmath433 , @xmath434 and @xmath435 .",
    "the failure of this relation in this case is due to the inhomogeneity of this particular graph . indeed for strongly inhomogeneous graphs",
    "the growth exponent does not give an accurate description of the `` fractal properties '' of the graph ( the assignment of the same @xmath11 of @xmath4 to @xmath3 disregards the topology of the two structures ) .",
    "it seems that defining @xmath11 as the growth exponent of the graph makes sense only for homogeneous graphs ( like @xmath422 ) or self - similar graphs , which have a clear fractal nature ( like the sierpiski graph ) .",
    "it is our opinion that the study of the sense in which a graph has a fractal nature and what is the proper definition of its fractal dimension should require further investigations .",
    "i feel particularly indebted to peter grabner and helmut prodinger for raising the questions discussed in this paper and for the stimulating discussions during which they suggested the techniques used in sections  [ sec : distances ] , [ sec : maxdev ] and [ sec : maxspan ] .",
