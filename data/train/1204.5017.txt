    "understanding the mechanism of particle production in @xmath1+@xmath1 collisions is one of the first goals of the experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "several new results from the lhc experiments in terms of particle multiplicities at @xmath5 = 0.9 , 2.36 , 2.76 and 7 tev are being compared to various models of particle production  @xcite .",
    "the most popular models for comparison to data from @xmath1+@xmath1 collisions being pythia  @xcite and phojet  @xcite .",
    "the phojet model combines the ideas based on a dual parton model ( dpm )  @xcite on soft process of particle production and uses lowest - order perturbative qcd for hard process .",
    "regge phenomenology is used to parameterize the total , elastic and inelastic cross - sections .",
    "the initial and final state parton shower are generated in leading log - approximation .",
    "pythia on the other hand uses string fragmentation as a process of hadronization and tends to use the perturbative parton - parton scattering for low to high @xmath7 particle production .",
    "initial results have shown that both models do not have perfect agreement with multiplicity measurements at lhc energies studied so far  @xcite .",
    "however it may be mentioned that several of these models in turn are used to obtain various correction factors for the experimental measurements . in this paper",
    "we suggest that the correlations between the particles produced in forward and backward rapidities can be used to discriminate between the various models of particle production , more reliably at the lhc energies .",
    "the forward - backward correlations previously observed had several physical interpretations .",
    "the correlations over small range in rapidity are believed to be dominated by short - range correlations as due to resonance decays , those occurring over large rapidity range could be interpreted to be due to multiple parton interactions . in early 1985 , a statistical interpretation of the forward - backward correlations observed in isr energies was provided  @xcite .",
    "the interpretation was based on clusters being produced in these hadronic collisions according to a negative binomial distribution and the final hadrons are a result of the decay of these clusters .",
    "an extended version of such a statistical scenario can be found in ref .",
    "a more dynamical interpretation was provided based on the dpm as in ref .",
    "the experimental data was also interpreted in terms of a model based on a unitarized model which included soft and semi - hard components ( minijets ) .",
    "in such a model the average number of particles produced was proportional to the effective number of inelastic collisions .",
    "the increase of forward - backward correlations with @xmath5 was fully generated by the superposition of the different impact parameter contributions to the inelastic cross section  @xcite .",
    "the extension of this interesting idea is to consider a weighted superposition of two classes of events in hadronic collisions : soft and semi - hard processes .",
    "the behavior of the semi - hard component on observed forward - backward correlations can lead to interesting interpretation in terms of the clan structure of particle production as discussed in refs  @xcite .",
    "the authors of refs  @xcite envision a possibility of formation of new species of clans at lhc and a possible phase transition in clan production mechanism .",
    "recently the forward - backward correlations have been related to the simplest form of partonic interaction that exhibits back - to - back correlation . such a formulation is found to give a fairly good description of data from star collaboration in @xmath1+@xmath1 collisions at @xmath5 = 200 gev  @xcite .",
    "studies of forward - backward correlations provide baseline measurements to look for long range rapidity correlation in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "star experiment has recently made this relative ( comparison between @xmath1+@xmath1 and different collision centrality au+au collisions at the center of mass energies of 200 gev ) measurements to claim the existence of a large long range correlation in central au+au collisions  @xcite .",
    "although the experimental data can not differentiate whether the actual underlying mechanism is due to those in a dual parton model  @xcite dpm or a color glass condensate  @xcite , both however require that the long range correlations are produced by multiple parton - parton interactions .",
    "further it is argued that the clustering of color sources could lead to forward - backward correlations  @xcite .",
    "hence the measurement of the long range forward backward correlations in the multiplicity of produced particles in high energy collisions will give us insight into the space - time dynamics of the collision .",
    "in this paper , we first review the existing experimental data on forward - backward correlations , discuss the model calculations and methods used to extract these correlations .",
    "this is followed by comparison of the experimental data on forward - backward correlations with those from pythia and phojet models , expectations at top lhc energies and interpretation of the data in terms of cluster production in high energy hadronic collisions .",
    "we find that the forward - backward correlations in @xmath1+@xmath1 collisions at @xmath5 = 7 , 10 , 14 tev will help differentiate various models and hence the underlying particle production mechanism .",
    "saturation of correlation strength at lhc energies could indicate new physics .",
    "the experimental charged particle data reviewed in this paper are from the e735 and ua5 collaboration .",
    "these data are for @xmath1+@xmath2 collisions and corresponds to non - singly diffractive events .",
    "the e735 data  @xcite corresponds to @xmath5 = 300 , 546 , 1000 and 1800 gev while those from ua5  @xcite corresponds to @xmath5 = 200 , 546 and 900 gev .",

    "a realistic transverse momentum cut of above 100 mev for charged particles are applied .",
    "the forward - backward correlations can be obtained by two methods .    *",
    "if @xmath10 is the multiplicity in backward hemisphere and @xmath11 is the corresponding multiplicity in forward hemisphere for the same event , then the correlation co - efficient can be obtained by plotting @xmath12(@xmath11 ) vs. @xmath11 . where @xmath13 denotes event average .",
    "the resultant distribution can be fitted to a linear function as @xmath12(@xmath11 ) = @xmath14 + @xmath0 @xmath11 , to obtained the correlation strength,@xmath0 . * the correlation coefficient can also be defined as @xmath15 .",
    "most of the results presented in this paper uses this method for calculating @xmath0 . for the model results presented we",
    "have explicitly checked and found there is good agreement between the two methods .    before we proceed towards discussion of the experimental data and results from model calculations , we discuss few relevant experimental aspects .",
