    "in the last years , there has been an increasing interest in so - called multiferroic materials , displaying simultaneously spontaneous ferroelectric ( fe ) polarization and ferro- or antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ordering .",
    "multiferroics exhibit a rich variety of fundamental physical phenomena , and it is generally believed that they have a potential for novel applications in non - volatile memories @xcite , magnonics  @xcite and magnetic sensors @xcite . these applications would rely on the coupling of order parameters on various time scales , from quasi - static to ultrafast . however , the understanding of the microscopic mechanism of the magnetodielectric coupling is still a fundamental problem of solid state physics .",
    "the static and dynamic magnetoelectric ( me ) couplings can have different origins . owing to the static me coupling , the macroscopic fe polarization emerges in the cycloidal or transverse conical modulated magnetic structures ; this polarization can change with magnetic field .",
    "in contrast , the dynamic me coupling generates an oscillatory polarization and leads to a dielectric dispersion in the terahertz ( thz ) region .",
    "indeed , thz studies of multiferroics revealed a new kind of electric - field - active spin excitations contributing to the dielectric permittivity @xmath2 , called electromagnons ( ems )  @xcite .",
    "their characteristic feature is a coupling with polar phonons , which manifests itself in the spectra by a transfer of dielectric strength from phonons to ems on cooling @xcite .",
    "in contrast to ferromagnetic and afm resonances , which are magnons from the brillouin zone ( bz ) center contributing to the magnetic permeability @xmath3 , the ems can be activated also outside of the bz center @xcite .",
    "the understanding of this fact is not trivial , because the photons which excite ems have wavevectors much smaller than the ems .",
    "thus , to date , there are several different theories attempting to explain the observed properties of ems in various materials @xcite .",
    "the ems were discovered first in tbmno@xmath4 and gdmno@xmath4 @xcite which belong to multiferroics denoted  @xcite as type ii , where the fe order is induced by a special magnetic ordering . since then , ems were confirmed in numerous type - ii multiferroics  @xcite .",
    "other reports of ems in type - i multiferroics ( e.g. bifeo@xmath5  @xcite or hex - ymno@xmath4 @xcite ) appear inconclusive , since no transfer of the dielectric strength from polar phonons to ems was observed  @xcite .",
    "also , recent infrared ir and thz studies did not confirm the em in hex - ymno@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "here we report experiments which reveal an excitation identified as an em in the ferrimagnetic @xmath6 phase of @xmath7 .",
    "thanks to its chemical simplicity , this phase appears also as a suitable model system for theoretical studies of electromagnonic excitations . while @xmath6-@xmath8 is quite rare and less known than the @xmath9 ( hematite ) or @xmath10 ( maghemite ) phases of @xmath1  @xcite ,",
    "its properties make it attractive for applications , such as electromagnetic - wave absorbers and memories  @xcite . owing to limited phase stability",

    "was observed , and magnetocapacitive measurements revealed a quadratic coupling @xcite .",
    "room - temperature microwave measurements provided evidence of a strong ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) near 0.74 ( frequency of 180ghz ) which can be tuned by doping with al , ga or rh  @xcite . in order to gain insight into the dynamic me properties of @xmath6-@xmath7 , we obtained thz , ir and inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) spectra of @xmath6-@xmath7 nano - grain ceramics upon cooling down to 10k , providing information about polar and magnetic excitations .",
    "the nanoparticles of @xmath6-@xmath7 were synthesized by sol - gel chemistry .",
    "@xmath20-@xmath7 composite gels containing 30 wt.% of @xmath8 were prepared from iron nitrate nonahydrate ( sigma - aldrich @xmath21 ) and tetraethoxysilane ( teos , sigma - aldrich 98% ) in hydroethanolic medium at teos : h@xmath22o : etoh = 1:6:6 molar ratio .",
    "iron nitrate was first dissolved and then teos added dropwise to the mixture under stirring .",
    "the sol was poured into 5 cm diameter petri dishes that were closed with its cover and gelation took place for between 4 and 5 weeks .",
    "the gels were dried overnight in a stove at 70@xmath23 , crushed and thermally treated in air atmosphere for 3 hours at 1100@xmath23   ( heating rate 80@xmath23/h ) .",
    "the resulting material was a composite of @xmath6-@xmath7 nanoparticles of about 25 nm in diameter dispersed in an amorphous @xmath20 matrix as checked by x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) which did not reveal any trace of other @xmath7 polymorphs .",
    "the silica was removed by stirring the composite powder for 12h in a 12 m aqueous naoh solution at 80@xmath23  under reflux .",
    "xrd patterns recorded after the silica removal revealed that the microstructure and the phase stability of @xmath6-@xmath7 nanoparticles were not affected by the etching process .",
    "the nanoparticles were further processed by spark plasma sintering ( sps ) in order to prepare a pellet suitable for dielectric , terahertz ( thz ) and ir measurements by pressing the @xmath6-@xmath7 powder in a graphite mould for 4 minutes at 350@xmath23  under 100mpa .",
    "the xrd analysis of the sintered pellet showed that the sps process did not induce any grain growth or phase transformation .",
    "finally , the sps pellets were polished to thin disks with a thickness of 1.2 mm .",
    "some ir and thz measurements were performed on @xmath6-@xmath7 pellets with a diameter of about 6 mm , which were prepared from powder at room temperature using a standard tabletop manual hydraulic press ( perkin elmer ) .",
    "the spectra were qualitatively the same , only the value of the high - frequency ir reflectance was affected by the roughness of the sample surface , which could not be polished .",
    "ir reflectance measurements with the resolution of 0.25mev were performed using the fourier transform infrared spectrometer bruker ifs-113v in near - normal reflectance geometry with an incidence angle of @xmath24 .",
    "an oxford instruments optistat optical cryostat with polyethylene windows was used for sample cooling down to 10k , and a liquid - he - cooled si bolometer operating at 1.6k was applied as a detector .",

    "all phonons above 12mev exhibit the usual behavior  their intensity increases due to reduced phonon damping at low temperatures .",
    "the to1 phonon near 11mev exhibits an anomalous behavior : on cooling , its intensity increases only down to 115k .",
    "below this temperature , it markedly weakens , while a supplementary broad reflectivity peak develops below @xmath30 and becomes more intense upon cooling ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : irtemp]a ) .",
    "this transfer of strengths involves also the to2 phonon ( see fig .   [",
    "fig : transfer ] ) , evidencing a coupling among these three polar modes . despite the lattice distortions which occur between 150k and 75k",
    ", the crystal symmetry of @xmath31 does not change with temperature @xcite .",
    "this is further confirmed by our ir reflectivity spectra , displaying a temperature - independent number of polar phonons ; should a structural phase transition occur , it would imply a change of the factor group analysis and different phonon selection rules .",
    "given the high number of atoms in the unit cell , multiple new reflection bands throughout the ir range would be observed .",
    "therefore , one can exclude the new mode to originate in a structural modification .",
    "another option to be considered is the polar phonon splitting due to exchange coupling below afm phase transitions which was reported in various transition - metal monoxides and chromium spinels @xcite ; the mode splitting increased on cooling below the nel temperature .",
    "however , this explanation can not be valid as we observe an opposite temperature dependence ",
    "the new mode appears below @xmath18 at low energies and hardens towards the to1 phonon energy on cooling , i.e.  their energy difference decreases .",
    "finally , one can not a priori exclude the hypothesis of activation of the to1 phonon branch from the area of the bz near its edge .",
    "this would require a folding of the structural bz which could be caused by a transfer of the magnetic bz folding ( linked to incommensurability ) via magnetostriction . nevertheless , in the x - ray diffraction studies , no appropriate satellite reflections were observed . even supposing these satellite reflections to be very weak",
    ", one would expect the off - center phonons to activate also at higher energies , which we did not observe .",

    "the resulting spectra , matching well the measured data , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : magnont]c , d .",
    "from the fit parameters , we derived the temperature dependence of the magnon strength and fmr energy ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : magnont]e ) .",
    "we observe a sharp drop in the resonance energy between 150k and 75k , very similar to that of the coercive field @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the fmr energy is proportional to the magnetocrystalline anisotropy field @xmath37 . as the sample consists of randomly oriented particles with a uniaxial magnetic anisotropy",
    ", @xmath37 is proportional to the @xmath38 value @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we measured thz time - domain spectra with external magnetic field ranging from 0 to 7 t . because of the high absorption of the em , lying near 10 mev , the sample was opaque above 7mev .",
    "therefore , we could measure only the low - frequency wing of the em .",
    "when the magnetic field is applied , two types of changes in the thz spectra can be observed : an increase of the fmr frequency corresponding to the peak of the @xmath39 spectra , and a change of the slope of both real and imaginary parts of the index of refraction , indicating shifts of the em frequency with magnetic field .",
