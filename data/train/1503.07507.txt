    "stripe patterns are arguably the simplest non - trivial patterns observed in nature .",
    "stripes form in numerous contexts , ranging from classical fluid experiments such as taylor vortices in the taylor - couette flow and convection rolls in rayleigh - bnard convection , over bilayers in diblock copolymers , to granular media , and reaction - diffusion systems .",
    "a well - studied context of stripe formation is an instability of a spatially homogeneous state in a spatially extended medium . a linearized analysis",
    "can then predict wavenumbers as linearly fastest growing modes .",
    "while known for more than a century in fluid dynamics , the occurrence of patterned states as fastest growing modes was conjectured by turing in 1952 @xcite for reaction - diffusion systems and experimentally realized in 1991 @xcite .",
    "the arguably simplest example for the formation of stripes is the celebrated swift - hohenberg equation @xmath0 considered on @xmath1 , for instance , the linearization at the trivial state @xmath2 , @xmath3 can be readily analyzed using fourier transform , @xmath4 for @xmath5 , wavenumbers with @xmath6 are unstable .",
    "the fastest - growing wavenumber is @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , for all @xmath8 , _ only _ wavenumbers with @xmath9 are unstable , so that for small amplitude only spatially patterned perturbations are amplified .",
    "a nonlinear analysis readily reveals that together with the linear instability , nonlinear patterns bifurcate from the trivial state . for @xmath5 small",
    ", one finds @xmath10-periodic `` striped '' solutions @xmath11 , @xmath12 , for all unstable @xmath13-vectors , @xmath6 .",
    "many of those periodic solutions are compatible with the boundary conditions in large but finite systems . with , say , periodic boundary conditions and system size @xmath14 , we need to require @xmath15 , which yields @xmath16 different @xmath13-values .    for boundary conditions other than neumann , dirichlet , or periodic , equilibria are difficult to characterize completely .",
    "in fact , bifurcations diagrams tend to be very complex , and of little help when trying to `` describe '' typical dynamics .",
    "interestingly , different types of boundary conditions can provoke quite different types of dynamics .",
    "for instance , heated walls in rayleigh - bnard convection are known to favor parallel alignment of roll solutions with the boundary , as opposed to the otherwise typical perpendicular alignments .",
    "slow drift of rolls has also been observed in contexts of rayleigh - bnard convection .",

    "such spectral stability has been shown to imply nonlinear stability with respect to localized perturbations and we will henceforth refer to this criterion simply as `` stability '' ; see @xcite .",

    "the steady - state equation @xmath54 can be rewritten as a first - order system , @xmath55 which possesses a reversibility symmetry @xmath56 stripes correspond to reversible periodic solutions @xmath57 .",
    "purely imaginary floquet exponents of the linearization at such a periodic solution give rise to kernels of the operators @xmath37 in a straight - forward fashion .",

    "the family of stripes therefore forms a two - dimensional normally hyperbolic manifold @xmath58 in @xmath59 .",
    "reversibility implies that both stable and unstable manifold @xmath60 are @xmath61-dimensional , and mapped into each other by @xmath62 .",

    "of course , many mixed and nonlinear variations are possible , and not all guarantee well - posedness of the parabolic equation ( [ e : par ] ) .",
    "equilibria of ( [ e : par ] ) in @xmath72 that satisfy the boundary conditions @xmath67 are bounded solutions @xmath73 to the ode ( [ e : ode ] ) , with @xmath74 , where @xmath67 is now considered as a natural @xmath65-dimensional submanifold of the phase space of @xmath59 of ( [ e : ode ] ) . in other words , equilibria are naturally identified via a multiple shooting problem ; see figure [ f : sch ] .",

    "the ginzburg - landau equation , equipped with a variety of inhomogeneous dirichlet , neumann , or mixed boundary conditions gives a plethora of interesting phenomena , including phase- and wavenumber selection , non - monotone displacement - strain , pinch - off of defects leading to end points of displacement - strain curves , absence of boundary layers and isolas , and displacement - strain curves of higher winding number .",
    "we also outline how to systematically explore such displacement - strain curves using numerical continuation and illustrate some preliminary results in the swift - hohenberg equation .",
    "our point of view raises numerous questions .",
    "first , we noted throughout that changes in the type of displacement - strain curve are accompanied by reconnection or separation events at the eckhaus boundary . a local analysis of the stable manifold there should reveal a universal description of such events",
    "one may also wonder if a variational structure in the boundary condition may lead to additional restrictions on boundary layers and bifurcations.we showed existence in the ginzburg - landau equation , but we suspect that , more generally , variational problems where periodic structures minimize the energy always accommodate boundary layers .",
    "much of our analysis is reminiscent of the analysis of snaking diagrams in , for instance , the weakly subcritical swift - hohenberg @xcite .",
    "there , the trivial stable state coexists with stable periodic patterns and interfaces between trivial and periodic states provide `` effective boundary conditions '' . due to translation invariance ,",
    "such boundary conditions are always pure wavenumber selecting , @xmath525 , so that interesting questions are concerned with changes of the selected wavenumber as parameters @xmath342 are varied .",
    "fold points of @xmath526 can be interpreted as unpinning transition .",
    "the analysis in @xcite is concerned with phase matching of such `` effective boundary layers '' , which yields spatially localized structures . due to the singularities of displacement - strain curves ,",

    "rolls allow for rotation as an additional degree of freedom .",
    "setting up boundary layer problems in @xmath160 , and @xmath527 periodic , we do encounter however a translational symmetry in @xmath420 which implies wavenumber selection due to arbitrary phases , for rolls that are not parallel to the boundary .",
    "the case of neumann boundary conditions has been studied extensively , since boundary layers can then be interpreted as symmetric grain boundaries ; see @xcite and references therein .    recognizing the analogy with defects such as grain boundaries , one can ask if there is a similar description for defects and their interactions .",
    "this appears to be an interesting avenue of research .",
    "some results in two space - dimensions @xcite indicate that properties such as phase selection can be attributed to inhomogeneities in higher - dimensional striped phases",
