    "interstellar extinction caused by dust affects most astronomical observations .",
    "light traversing a certain distribution of interstellar medium ( ism ) produces an integrated effect on extinction .",
    "extinction traces the dust grains , but also diminishes the starlight and limits our ability to interpret the local and distant universe .",
    "the study of interstellar dust provides insight into the properties of the extinction .",
    "since dust is a strong coolant , it also plays a critical role in controlling galaxy evolution and star formation .",
    "observations of interstellar extinction require a beacon shining through interstellar material . in the milky way ,",
    "a very large number of sightlines are available for this purpose , while in external galaxies there are few point source beacons bright enough to study the local ism .",
    "supernovae ( sne ) are the best , and often only , choice .",
    "light echoes provide additional information because they literally reflect light - scattering properties and do not reach the observer along exactly the same path .",
    "if sne are nearby , even resolved light echoes may be observable .",
    "the extinction ( in magnitudes ) at a certain wavelength or bandpass , @xmath8 , is often expressed as @xmath9 .",
    "the ` total - to - selective ' extinction @xmath10 depends on the properties of the dust along the line of sight and can be derived by comparing the observed @xmath11 with the extinction curves given by @xcite .",
    "the observered wavelength dependence of interstellar extinction contains information on both the size and composition of the grains .",
    "the value of @xmath12 @xcite has been often considered the galactic standard , but with a range from 2.2 to 5.8 @xcite for different lines of sight .",
    "there is increasing evidence that extinction curves towards type ia sne exhibit a steeper wavelength dependence ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "@xcite reported the detection of circumstellar material ( csm ) in the local environment surrounding the type ia supernova sn  2006x in the nearby galaxy m100 .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , show that the scattered light from csm tends to reduce the value of @xmath14 in the optical .",
    "the effect on @xmath15 and the light curve shape , however , also depends on the geometrical configuration and dust - grain properties ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is of critical importance to understand whether the low @xmath15 values are caused by ( 1 ) systematic differences from extragalactic environments , or ( 2 ) inhomogeneities in the vicinity of the sn - earth direct line of sight ( dlos ) , or ( 3 ) modifications by csm scattering .    the most reliable approach in determining the extinction is the ` pair method '  comparing spectrophotometry of two sources with the same spectral energy distribution , one of which has negligible foreground extinction .",
    "extragalactic reddening can be measured by comparing observed type ia sne to a zero - reddening locus ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , information acquired through this pair method is limited to single sightlines .",
    "photons scattered by dust travel a slightly different path compared to the directly transmitted light .",
    "therefore , scattered photons provide chances to test the scattering properties of the dust in a bi - dimensional space .",
    "light echoes result when light from a source is scattered off some screen into the viewer s line of sight .",
    "here we consider the case of a sn and csm / ism .",
    "because of the high initial brightness of sne , searches for late - time off - source flux excesses have been the main approaches to detect light echoes residing close to the sne , i.e. , the slowly fading light curves of sn  1991 t @xcite , sn  1998bu @xcite , and sn  2006x @xcite . outside the solar system , spatially resolved light echoes have been rare events .",
    "the first one reported arose around nova persei 1901 @xcite , followed by nova sagittarii 1936 @xcite .",
    "echoes were also found from the galactic cepheid rs puppis @xcite and , with _",
    "hst _ angular sampling , from the eruptive star v838 monocerotis @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported the detection of an infrared echo near the galactic supernova remnant cassiopeia a. additionally , spectroscopic observations of nearby light echoes provide unique opportunities to probe the progenitor properties of historical transients @xcite and in some cases the three dimenisonal structure of the explosion .",
    "for instance , an ancient eruption from @xmath16 carinae @xcite , asymmetry in the outburst of sn  1987a @xcite and cassiopeia a @xcite . in recent years",
    ", the number of light echoes from extragalactic sne has grown rapidly , mostly thanks to _ hst_. table [ table_1 ] provides an overview of the events recorded to date , updated from table 1 of @xcite .",
    "photons from spatially - resolved light echoes travel a slightly different path compared to the dlos from the sn to earth .",
    "therefore , observations of a resolved light echo around a nearby sn provide a unique opportunity to measure the extinction properties of the dust along the dlos and the scattering properties of the echo - producing dust independently and simultaneously . as the sn fades ,",
    "outer echoes ( echoes with larger angular diameter ) associated with ism at large distances to the sn will become less contaminated by its bright light , and any inner echoes associated with ism at small distances to the sn , and even the csm , will become detectable .",
    "the expansion with time of the light echoes maps out the 3d structure of ism along and close to the line of sight .",
    "detailed introductions to the relation between 2-dimensional light echoes and 3-dimensional scattering dust distributions has been given in various studies @xcite .",
    "here we just briefly define the geometry used through this paper , also shown in figure [ fig_1 ] , which considers the sn event as an instantaneous flash of radiation .",
    "the locus of constant light travel time is an ellipsoid with the supernova at one focus which we refer to as an iso - delay surface .",
    "the ellipsoid grows with time as the light propagates in space .    the angular radius of the light echo ( @xmath17 )",
    "can be easily measured in two - dimensional images .",
    "sn is centered at the origin of the plane , x and y give the coordinates of the scattering materials in the plane of the sky . the projected distance ( @xmath18 ) of scattering material to the sn perpendicular to the dlos",
    "is related to the distance ( @xmath19 ) to the sn as @xmath20 , @xmath21 gives the position angle ( pa ) . because @xmath19 is significantly larger compared to other geometric dimensions",
    ", the light echo can be very well approximated by a paraboloid , with the sn lying at its focus .",
    "@xmath22 can be obtained by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the time since the radiation burst , @xmath25 gives the foreground distance of the scattering material along the line of sight , and @xmath26 denotes the speed of light .",
    "the distance @xmath27 of the scattering material from the sn is : @xmath28 the scattering angle can be obtained from : @xmath29 , or , @xmath30 .",
    "the nearby type ia sn  2014j in m82 offers the rare opportunity to study the physical properties and spatial distribution of dust particles along _ and close to _ the dlos and as well in the vicinity of the sn .",
    "sn  2014j suffers from heavy extinction and is located behind a large amount of interstellar dust @xcite . additionally , the absorption profiles of na and k lines from high - resolution spectroscopy exhibit more than ten extragalactic absorption components , indicating the extinction along the dlos is caused by the combined presence of a large number of distinct interstellar dust clouds along the dlos @xcite .",
    "sn  2014j was discovered on jan 21.805 ut by @xcite .",
    "later observations constrained the first light of the sn to jan .",

    "continuous photometric and spectroscopic observations through late phases have been made by various groups .",
    "there is clear evidence that the strong extinction measured from sn  2014j is caused primarily by interstellar dust @xcite , although a mix of interstellar and circumstellar dust is also possible @xcite .",
    "several independent studies , including photometric color fitting from swift / uvot and _ hst _ @xcite , near - uv / optical grism spectroscopy from swift uvot @xcite , _ hst _ stis spectroscopy and wfc3 photometry @xcite , reddening curve fitting near the sn maximum using the silicate - graphite model @xcite , as well as optical spectroscopy from @xcite found an @xmath33 towards sn  2014j .",
    "moreover , ground - based broad - band imaging polarimetry @xcite and spectropolarimetry @xcite have shown that the polarization peak due to interstellar dust extinction is shortward of @xmath34 , which indicates that this line of sight has peculiar serkowski parameters ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this polarization wavelength dependence can be interpreted in terms of a significantly enhanced abundance of small grains @xcite .",
    "models considering both interstellar dust and circumstellar dust simultaneously and fitted to observed extinction and polarization @xcite find that a significant enhancement ( w.r.t .  the milky way ) in the total mass of small grains ( @xmath35 0.1 @xmath36 ) is required to reproduce low values of @xmath15 .",
    "multiple time - invariant d and h&k absorption features as well as several diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) have also been identified @xcite . those are most likely associated with multiple dust components of interstellar material along the dlos",
    "the nature ( amount and distribution ) of circumstellar material is of interest when probing the possible diversity of progenitors of type ia sne and for accurately correcting the extinction when using type ia sne as standard candles .",

    "@xcite reported variable interstellar lines in high - resolution spectra , which may form about 10 light years ( @xmath39 cm ) in front of the sn .",

    ".      two main echo components are evident . in figure [ fig_4 ]",

    "closer to the sn , uncertainties in the psf correction prevent reliable detections . on + 277 d ,",
    "the most notable features of the light echoes in f475w are three luminous clumps at angular radius @xmath48 and pas 80@xmath49 , 120@xmath49 , and 150@xmath49 , measured from north ( 0@xmath50 ) through east ( 90@xmath50 ) .",
    "these clumpy structures are already present on + 216 d at the same pas but appear smoother and more extended .",
    "they eventually evolve into a fairly continuous luminous quarter - circle arc seen on both + 365 d and + 416 d extending from pa = 60@xmath49 - 170@xmath49 .",
    "images obtained on + 216 d with f438w and f555w show the luminous arc at angular radii @xmath51 and @xmath52 , over roughly the same range in pa , in agreement with @xcite .",

    "this is different from the foreground distance of @xmath7 330 pc discussed for this prominent echo component by @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy may be due to the difficulties and uncertainties in subtracting the psf in earlier epoch when the sn is still bright , or in distinguishing the multiple light echo components identified in our multi - epoch data .    to enable a more quantitative description of the light echoes and their evolution , we performed photometry on them in backgound - subtracted images ( figure [ fig_4 ] ) .",
    "we measured the surface brightness of the light echo profile at different radii and over different ranges in pa .",
    "fan - shaped apertures centered on the sn were used to sample the intensity . the width in pa of each aperture",

    ", it is sufficient to recall that a dust slab intersecting the line of sight will produce a circular light echo .",
    "any uneven distribution of material in the slab results in an uneven flux distribution along the circle , and the light echo may be composed of incomplete arcs .",
    "a dust slab always produces a ( complete or incomplete ) circular light echo , irrespective of its inclination with respect to the line of sight . when a dust slab is not perpendicular to the line of sight ,",
    "the center of the light echo circle will not coincide with the sn position , and it moves with time .",
    "the luminous arc echo is unresolved with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the radial profile approximately that of the sn measured in the same images , i.e. @xmath7 0.1@xmath43 ( 2 pixels ) .",
    "therefore , we consider the luminous arc was formed by a thin dust slab intersecting the line of sight . we have fitted circles to the positions of the luminous arc at all available epochs .",
    "none of them is significantly decentered from the sn .",
    "this implies that the dust slab producing the arc echo is fairly perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "table [ table_4 ] summarises the geometric properties measured from the luminous arc .",
    "in addition to the luminous arc , a radially - extended and diffuse structure is identified , which on + 277 d is present in f475w and f606w and spread over @xmath54 to @xmath55 .",
    "this structure can also be noticed on + 365 d in f438w and f555w ( from @xmath56 to @xmath57 ) .",
    "it appears more clearly on + 416/417 d in f475w and f606w ( from @xmath58 to @xmath59 ) because for these observations longer exposure times were used .",
    "the epochs of observation and the exclusion of the inner 0.3@xmath43 limit the foreground distances explored from @xmath60 pc to @xmath61 pc . on + 216 d",
    ", the diffuse component can not be identified in f438w but is marginally seen in f555w .",
    "however , the inner and outer radii of the diffuse structure can not be well determined because of uncertainties in the psf subtraction .",
    "the diffuse light echo observed on + 277 d can be produced by a dust cloud intersecting the iso - delay surface over a wide range in foreground distance .",
    "the line - of - sight extent of this diffuse dust cloud is indicated by the filled profile of the echoes .",
    "therefore , a continuous dust distribution over a certain range of foreground distances along the line of sight is required .    in each panel of the radial profiles in figures [ fig_5 ] and [ fig_6 ] , the radially - resolved positive flux excesses ( on + 277 d and + 416 d ) , and also the radially - extended negative flux due to the subtraction of the light echo on + 796 d , suggest the presence of an extended and inhomogeneous foreground dust distribution . outside the @xmath62 region",
    "where as discussed earlier , the imperfect psf subtraction makes the detection of echoes unreliable .",

    "therefore , in order to compare the model flux distribution with the flux in a 2-dimensional image , one needs to integrate the model flux over the physical depth covered by the pixel .",
    "since each pixel has size @xmath98 , and @xmath99 , this implies : @xmath100    the geometric factor is determined by the radial distance to the sn , @xmath18 .",

    "the luminous arc at @xmath22 = 10@xmath711 pc has an average value @xmath1411.7 ( unitless ) , shown by the black histograms .",
    "for the diffuse structure , the right panel indicates an average value @xmath71.3 .",
    "this difference in the wavelength dependence measured from the scattering optical depth indicates that the size distributions of the grains in the thin dust slab producing the luminous arc is different from the grains in the foreground extended dust cloud producing the diffuse echo .",
    "while this difference is significant , one should be cautious about the inferred absolute values of @xmath15 in this approach , considering the low signal - to - noise ratio and the large uncertainties .",
    "the diffuse echo component favors a higher @xmath15 than the luminous arc , corresponding to a less steep wavelength dependence of the extinction in the diffuse echo compared to the luminous arc . in general terms",
    ", this implies that the grains in the dust slab producing the luminous arc are smaller than those in the extended , diffuse ism . the @xmath15 value measured from the diffuse echo at @xmath142 pc to the position of sn  2014j , i.e.",
    ", @xmath143 is close to that found by @xcite by modelling the attenuation law based on near - ultraviolet and optical photometry of m82 at large .",
    "accordingly , the dust grains in the extended foreground ism producing the diffuse echo ring are similar in size to those in the milky way .",
    "extinction in the luminous arc , however , favors a smaller @xmath15 value , similar to the extinction law deduced from the sn itself , represented by @xmath33 .",
    "this similarity indicates that the grain size distribution in the slab of ism producing the luminous arc is similar to the ism responsible for the extinction measured towards the sn at early epochs .",
    "the optical depth due to light scattered by the ism can be estimated as follows .",
    "if they have similar properties as milky way - like dust with @xmath15 = 3.1 , @xmath144 ranges from 0.3 at pa 225@xmath50 - 270@xmath50 , covering part of the diffuse ring , to 0.9 at pa 45@xmath50 - 90@xmath50 , where the luminous arc is brightest .",
    "these optical depths are smaller than that along the dlos . one possible explanation for the discrepancy can be an overestimate of the degree of forward scattering . at + 277 d ,",
    "the scattering angle is @xmath145 for the luminous arc - producing dust .",
    "a dramatic increase in forward scattering occurs with increasing grain size while smaller grains scatter light more isotropically , leading to a smaller value of the phase function , i.e. , see chapter 5 of @xcite .",
    "therefore , to produce a light echo of the same strength , smaller dust grains in the ism responsible for the luminous arc require a higher optical depth than larger milky way - like dust grains do .    to illustrate the dependence of the degree of forward scattering on the optical depth",
    ", we investigate the heyney - greenstein phase function characterizing the angular distribution of scattered light intensity as shown by equation [ eqn_phasefunction ] .",
    "figure [ fig_13 ] demonstrates the fraction of scattered light at small scattering angle , i.e. , @xmath67 as a function of scattering asymmetry factor , @xmath146 . in this figure , values of @xmath147 and @xmath148",
    "are indicated for astronomical silicate and graphite grains with radius of @xmath149 micron according to calculations based on @xcite and @xcite .",
    "when the grains are significantly smaller than the wavelength of light , the classical rayleigh scattering limit is reached .",
    "the asymmetry factor for rayleigh scattering is @xmath150 , and the phase function becomes unity , indicating no directional preference of scattering .",
    "this is the case for the luminous arc while the phase function has a value of 7.8 for milky - way dust with @xmath15 = 3.1 .",
    "this means that the optical depth calculated for the case of rayleigh scattering is 7.8 times larger than for milky - way dust with @xmath15 = 3.1 .",
    "the densest part of the scattering material will attain a value of @xmath7 7.0 in f475w , significantly larger than the optical depth measured along the dlos . on the other hand , for larger grains the asymmetry factor",
    "@xmath146 approaches unity , and the efficiency of forward scattering increases substantially .",
    "the grain size distribution in the extinction - producing material towards sn  2014j itself is similar to that of the luminous arc - producing material , as inferred from the similarity of @xmath15 found in both of the two ism components . considering this low @xmath15 and the lower optical depth found in the scattering material responsible for the luminous arc",
    ", we infer that these scattering materials are also responsible for the extinction towards sn  2014j .",
    "due to the lack of knowledge about the detailed distribution and optical properties of the dust in m82 , we can not rule out the possibility that the different extinctions along the scattering line of sight of the materials and the dlos may partly also be caused by a denser ism along the dlos",
    ". the extinction along the dlos may also be due to dust at small foreground distances which would produce light echoes too close to the sn to be detected . additionally , it is possible that the extinction can be generated by interstellar dust clouds placed too far in front of the sn .",
    "recall equations [ eqn_r ] and [ eqn_lumi ] , the luminosity of the light echo resulting from a dust slab intersecting the dlos decreases as @xmath151 ( where @xmath27 is the distance between the sn and the dust slab ) .",
    "considering numerous na , ca , and k features have been seen along the dlos , we can not rule out the possibility that there are dust clouds placed more than 500 pc away from the sn and can hardly be detected in current images .",
    "the presented light - echo model is necessarily only a simplified approximation of reality .",
    "our model attempts to reproduce the optical depth of the scattering material over a projected area of @xmath7 40 pc @xmath44 40 pc in the plane of the sky , and it compares it to the optical depth measured for the dlos .",
    "one major source of uncertainty is the assumption of single scattering @xcite . in view of the large extinction measured towards sn  2014j , a monte carlo simulation with various grain size distributions",
    "should give a better representation of the real scattering process .",
    "another uncertainty results from the usage of the extinction measured along the dlos around maximum light also for the echo - producing material .",
    "additionally , the assumption of galactic @xmath15 values may not be realistic for m82 .",
    "the geometric and photometric evolution of resolved light echoes around sn  2014j was monitored with _",
    "hst_. two main constituents were found . from a luminous arc , a discrete slab of dust",
    "was inferred at a foreground distance of 228@xmath327pc .",
    "in addition , a resolved , diffuse ring - like light echo implies that another foreground ism component is widely distributed over distances of @xmath7 100 - 500 pc .",
    "if the scattering material suffers the same extinction as along the dlos , the densest part has a number density of @xmath7 1.5 @xmath152 @xmath45 , based on a single - scattering - plus - attenuation approach . the scattering material is unevenly distributed with pa .",
    "the wavelength dependence of the scattering optical depth is steeper in the luminous arc than in the diffuse ring .",
    "the former favors a small @xmath153 1.4 as also measured along the dlos , and the latter is more consistent with a normal @xmath153 3 .",
    "this suggests that the average grain size is smaller in the ism responsible for the luminous arc , and the more widely distributed scattering materials have average properties similar to milky way - like dust .",
    "the optical depth of the scattering material estimated from the scattering properties of milky - way - like dust with @xmath15 = 3.1 is smaller than the optical depth measured along the dlos .",
    "the optical depth along the dlos is better reproduced with smaller grains as also indicated for the dust slab responsible for the luminous arc .",
    "this suggests that an extension of this dust slab , or a separate cloud with similar properties , is also responsible for the extinction towards sn  2014j .",
    "more data will be collected in future observing compaigns , which will help additionally characterize the extinction laws measured within different light echo components .",
    "further constraints on the amount and properties of the circumstellar and interstellar material from polarimetry and very late - time photometry will be discussed in future work .",
