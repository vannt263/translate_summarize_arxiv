    "the error bars of simulation and qns data are of the order of the size of the symbols.,title=\"fig : \" ]    an arrhenius plot of the diffusion constants as obtained from simulation and experiment is shown in fig .  [ fig7 ] .",
    "the self  diffusion constants @xmath10 and @xmath140 from the simulation are very similar over the whole temperature range 4490k@xmath141k . in a recent publication @xcite , we have found that , in the framework of our simulation model , this similarity of the self  diffusion constants occurs in al rich compositions of the system al  ni , say for @xmath142 .",
    "whether this is also true in real systems is an open question .",
    "however , the neutron scattering results for @xmath10 as well as the single point obtained from the lc measurement is in very good agreement with the simulation data .",
    "asta _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have computed the concentration dependence of the self  diffusion constants at @xmath143  k using two different embedded atom potentials , namely the one proposed by voter and chen @xcite and the one proposed by foiles and daw @xcite . for both potentials",
    ", they find very similar values for @xmath10 and @xmath140 in al@xmath0ni@xmath1 , in agreement with our results .",
    "however , their results for the ni diffusion constant are significantly higher than the ones found in our quasielastic neutron scattering experiment and our simulation .",
    "they report the values @xmath144m@xmath145/s and @xmath146m@xmath145/s for the voter ",
    "chen potential and the foiles  daw potential , respectively , whereas we obtain @xmath147m@xmath145/s from simulation and experiment .",
    "thus , the potential proposed by mishin _",
    "@xcite , which is used in this work , leads to a better agreement with the experiment , as far as self  diffusion in al@xmath0ni@xmath1 is concerned .",
    "we emphasize that the statistical error in both the neutron scattering data and the simulation data for the self  diffusion constants is relatively small . in both cases",
    ", the error bars for the corresponding data points in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] are smaller than the size of the symbols .    due to the lack of self ",
    "averaging , it is much more difficult to yield accurate results for @xmath4 from the simulation .",
    "therefore , in this case we considered a smaller temperature range than for the self  diffusion constants to yield results with reasonable accuracy . as we can infer from fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , the interdiffusion constant is larger than the self  diffusion constants over the whole temperature range . the difference becomes more pronounced with decreasing temperature . at @xmath148k ,",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath4 is about a factor of 3 larger than @xmath10 and @xmath140 .",
    "this behavior is of course due to the increase of the thermodynamic factor @xmath3 at low temperature .",
    "also included in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] are the results of the lc measurements of @xmath4 and @xmath10 .",
    "these results are much less accurate than those of the quasielastic neutron scattering experiments for the determination of @xmath10 ( see the error bars for the lc data in fig .",
    "[ fig7]b ) .",
    "nevertheless , the lc data show that @xmath149 holds , in agreement with the simulation results .",
    "a combination of experiment and molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation has been used to investigate the diffusion dynamics in liquid al@xmath0ni@xmath1 .",
    "we find good agreement between simulation and experiment .",
    "both in experiment and in simulation , the interdiffusion constant is higher than the self  diffusion constants .",
    "this is valid in the whole temperature range considered in this work , i.e.  in the normal liquid state as well as in the undercooled regime . in the latter regime ( which is only accessible by the simulation ) , the difference between the interdiffusion constant and the self  diffusion constants increases with decreasing temperature .",
    "all these observations can be clarified by the detailed information provided by the md simulation . both the thermodynamic factor @xmath3 and the manning factor @xmath63 have been estimated directly and accurately over a wide temperature range , as well as self  diffusion and interdiffusion coefficients .",
    "the central result of this work is shown in fig .",
    "whereas the thermodynamic factor @xmath3 increases significantly by lowering the temperature , the manning factor @xmath63 shows only a weak temperature dependence .",
    "moreover , the value of @xmath63 is close to one which means that dynamic cross correlations are almost negligible and thus , even in the undercooled regime , the darken equation is a good approximation .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath3 is plausible for a dense binary mixture with a strong ordering tendency .",
    "the situation is similar to the case of the isothermal compressibility which normally decreases with temperature in a densely packed liquid leading to very low values in the undercooled regime . in the same sense , the response to a macroscopic concentration fluctuation described by @xmath150 tends to become smaller and smaller towards the undercooled regime which corresponds to an increase of @xmath3 with decreasing temperature ( since @xmath151 ) .",
    "we note that the data shown for @xmath4 are all above the critical temperature @xmath152 of mode coupling theory which is around 700k for our simulation model ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) @xcite .",
    "since it is expected that the transport mechanism changes below @xmath152 @xcite , it would be interesting to see how such a change in the transport mechanism is reflected in the interdiffusion constants . this issue is the subject of forthcoming studies .",
