    "the study of non compact knots began with vassiliev @xcite .",
    "he proved that any non - compact knot type can be obtained from a polynomial embedding @xmath4 the proof uses weierstrass approximation theorem on a compact interval , the degrees of the polynomials may be quite large , and the plane projections of the polynomial knots quite complicated .",
    "independently , shastri @xcite gave a detailed proof of this theorem , he also gave simple polynomial parametrizations of the trefoil and of the figure eight knot .",
    "this is what motivated a. ranjan and rama shukla @xcite to find small degree parametrizations of the simplest knots , the torus knots of type @xmath5 odd , denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "they proved that these knots can be attained from polynomials of degrees @xmath7 in particular , they obtain a parametrization of the trefoil @xmath8 analogous to shastri s one .",
    "they also asked the natural question which is to find the minimal degrees of the polynomials representing a general torus knot of a given type ( there is an analogous question in vassiliev s paper @xcite ) .",
    "the number of crossings of a plane projection of @xmath6 is at least @xmath9 ( bankwitz theorem , see @xcite ) .",
    "it is not difficult to see , using bzout theorem , that this plane curve can not be parametrized by polynomials of degrees smaller than @xmath10    naturally , rama mishra ( @xcite ) asked whether it was possible to parametrize the knot @xmath11 by polynomials of degrees @xmath12 when @xmath13 , or @xmath14    in this paper , we shall prove the following result . _",
    "if @xmath15 is odd , the torus knot @xmath16 can not be represented by polynomials of degrees @xmath17 _ our method is based on the fact that all plane projections of @xmath6 with the minimal number @xmath9 of crossings have essentially the same diagram .",
    "this is a consequence of the now solved classical tait s conjectures @xcite .",
    "this allows us to transform our problem into a problem of real polynomial algebra .    as a conclusion",
    ", we give explicit parametrizations of @xmath18 and @xmath19 by our result , they are of minimal degrees .",
    "we also give an explicit parametrization of @xmath20 with a plane projection possessing the minimal number of crossing points .",
    "this embedding is of smaller degree than those already known .",
    "if @xmath9 is odd , the torus knot @xmath6 of type @xmath0 is the boundary of a moebius band twisted @xmath9 times ( see @xcite ) .",

    "@xmath55 and @xmath61 are distinct points and correspond to the same crossing point .",
