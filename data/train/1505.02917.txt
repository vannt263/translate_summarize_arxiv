    "in the last 15 years or so , cosmological observations have improved greatly and it also appears that the values are converging on their true values . and @xmath3 was already made by @xcite ; the values of the concordance model thus do not need the supernova data , though of course adding more data improves the constraints . while the corresponding uncertainties have dramatically decreased ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the values themselves have remained constant over the last twenty years . ]",
    "this allows us to answer such questions ( provided , of course , that ` standard assumptions ' hold ) as whether the universe will expand for ever ( yes ) , how old it is , whether it is accelerating now ( yes ) , when it started accelerating , etc .",
    "( with the assumption of a simple topology , the universe is finite if @xmath9 , but since observations indicate that this value is very close to 1 , we can not yet answer this question . ) among the most important of these observations are those by the supernova cosmology project ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the high-@xmath1 supernova search team ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ( see also the reviews by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) which provide joint constraints on @xmath4  and @xmath5 .",
    "combined with other observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , these lead to quite well constrained values for the cosmological parameters ( e.g.  fig .  5 in *",
    "although the supernova data alone allow a relatively wide range of significantly different other models , it is interesting that the best - fitting  values obtained from these observations using the current data are quite close to the much better constrained values using combinations of several observations without the supernova data , at least under the assumptions with which the former were calculated .",
    "however , since the @xmath0@xmath1 relation depends not only on @xmath4  and @xmath5  ( with @xmath6as a scale factor ) but also on the distribution of matter along and near the line of sight , the dependence of conclusions drawn from the @xmath0@xmath1 relation for type  ia supernovae on this matter distribution should be investigated .",
    "alternatively , these observations can perhaps tell us something about this distribution .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ theory ] sketches the basic theory used in this paper . in section  [ history ]",
    "i briefly review previous investigations of the influence of a locally inhomogeneous universe on the @xmath0@xmath1 relation .",
    "section  [ main ] describes the calculations done and discusses the results .",
    "summary , conclusions and outlook are presented in section  [ final ] .",
    "* hereafter khs ) developed a general and practical method for calculating cosmological distances in the case of a locally inhomogeneous universe .",
    "see khs for details ( and for a description of the notation , which is followed here ) ; here i repeat only the most important points for the purpose of this paper .    if the universe is homogeneous , then the fact that light propagates along null geodesics provides sufficient information to calculate distances from redshift .",
    "if the universe is locally inhomogeneous , then distances which depend on angular observables related to the propagation of radiation will differ from the homogeneous case because more or less convergence will change the angle involved ( the angle at the observer in the case of the angular - size distance , that at the source in the case of the luminosity distance ) .",
    "the basic idea is that one considers a universe which is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales , this determining the global dynamics via the friedmann  lematre equation .",
    "local inhomogeneities are modelled as clumps , where the extra matter in the clumps is taken from the surrounding matter .",
    "thus , a beam which propagates between clumps will have only this thinned - out matter inside the beam , while outside the beam the average density ( taking both the thinned - out background matter and the clumps into account ) is approximately equal to the global density ( precisely so in the limit of an infinitesimal beam ) .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite developed a general differential equation for the distance @xmath10 between two light rays on the boundary of a small light cone ( the beam ) propagating far away from all clumps of matter in a locally inhomogeneous universe : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the gravitational constant , @xmath13 the scale factor , and @xmath7 ( defined below ) and the density @xmath14 are functions of time ( a dot indicates differentiation with respect to time ) .",
    "the first term can be interpreted as ricci focusing due to the matter inside the beam , and the second term is due to the expansion of space during the light propagation .",
    "the key assumption here is that while the the density @xmath14 within the beam can differ from the overall density , the overall dynamics of the universe is still described by the friedmann  lematre equation .",
    "the assumption that the light propagates far from all clumps means that weyl focusing ( shear ) can be neglected . in the case",
    "that the densities inside the beam and outside the beam are the same , one of course recovers the homogeneous case .",
    "since the angular - size distance is defined as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the angle at the apex of the beam ( at the observer , not at the observed object ) , @xmath17 follows the same differential equation as @xmath10 . making use of this",
    ", one can derive a general equation for the angular - size distance , valid for all ( perturbed , in the sense described above ) friedmann  lematre cosmological models and all reasonable ( see below ) values of @xmath7 .",
    "khs described the inhomogeneity via  the parameter @xmath8 , where @xmath7 is ratio of the density inside the beam to the global density or , alternatively , the fraction of matter which is homogeneously distributed , as opposed to being clumped .. i , and some others , use @xmath7 because locally inhomogeneous cosmological models are often used in gravitational lensing ( which per se  implies local inhomogeneities ) where @xmath18 is almost always used to denote the deflection angle . ]",
    "this leads to a second - order differential equation for the angular - size distance ( equation  ( 33 ) in khs ) which can be efficiently integrated numerically : @xmath19 where @xmath20 in the locally inhomogeneous case as well the luminosity distance , which is needed in this paper , is larger than the angular - size distance by a factor of @xmath21 .",
    "this change , compared to the perfectly homogeneous case , is essentially a negative gravitational - lensing effect . in a conventional gravitational - lensing scenario ,",
    "if the density at a given redshift between two light rays is higher than the overall density ( the corresponding overdensity being ` the lens ' ) , then there will be more convergence than in the case where the two densities are the same . in the case of light propagating between clumps , as described above , the situation is reversed , and the density between the light rays defining the distance - related angle is less than the overall density .",
    "this means that there is ( negative ) ricci focusing ( and no weyl focusing ) , making objects appear fainter than they would be in the completely homogeneous case .",
    "of course , this is only a rough model , but can be expected to be more realistic than the completely homogeneous case and to determine not just the sign of the difference but also give at least an estimate of its strength .",
    "obviously , one can not have @xmath22 .",
    "however , it does not make sense to have @xmath23 either . while it is certainly possible that the average density inside the beam could be greater than the global density , such cases are either unrealistic or not useful .",
    "the limiting case where the density in the beam is greater than the global density by a constant factor at every redshift is unrealistic because this would imply the existence of overdense regions with an extreme length - to - width ratio which are aligned between us and the source , which is incompatible with homogeneity and isotropy on large scales and would also put us in a special position .",
    "the other limiting case where a single compact object increases the density in the beam to above the global density is certainly possible , but observationally would show up as a gravitational - lens effect and should be analysed as such ( perhaps by adopting @xmath24 for the distance calculation and explicitly calculating the amplification ) .",
    "of course , cases between these two extremes are possible , but it is clear that @xmath7 must be between 0 and 1 if it is used as an additional parameter in the manner described by khs ; lines of sight which , due to fluctuations , are slightly denser than the overall density are certainly possible , but are not usefully parametrizedby @xmath7 in the style of khs .",
    "( but see @xcite for a toy model with an interesting extension of the @xmath7 concept . ) note that @xmath7 does not have to be constant as a function of redshift , and the code described in khs supports an arbitrary dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath1 . also , it could be different for different lines of sight .",
    "it was pointed out by @xcite that @xmath7 must be 1 when averaged over all lines of sight ( allowing for the moment higher - than - global densities to be parametrized  by @xmath23 ) , which follows from flux conservation .",
    "however , in practice lines of sight will probably avoid concentrations of matter , due to selection effects or design : distant objects will be more difficult to observed if there is luminous matter along the line of sight or if there is absorbing matter along the line of sight.@xmath1 relation for type  ia supernovae is that they are standard candles , or can be adjusted to behave as standard candles with the help of other observations , which means that the differential ( integral ) luminosity function is essentially a delta ( heaviside ) function , so the amplification bias plays no role here .",
    "also , since objects much fainter than supernovae can be detected in the corresponding observations , no realistic amplification would make an otherwise undetectable object visible . ]",
    "if these selection effects do not exist , and if the sample is large enough , then the ` safety in numbers ' effect @xcite allows one to effectively assume @xmath25 , with inhomogeneity merely increasing the dispersion , roughly linearly with redshift .",
    "however , @xcite point out that most narrow - beam lines of sight are significantly underdense , even for beams much thicker than those considered in this paper .",
    "( on the other hand , they also point out that this does not necessarily lead to a reduction in brightness if one drops the assumption that inhomogeneities can be modelled as perturbations on a uniformly expanding background , a point also emphasized by @xcite ; see also @xcite . )",
    "the situation discussed above corresponds to the situation where the beam contains a density @xmath7 times the global density at a given redshift and outside the beam the density is equal to the global density . in practice",
    ", this means that a fraction @xmath7 of the mass in the universe is smoothly distributed and a fraction @xmath26 is contained in clumps outside the beam . of course , ` smoothly ' depends on the size of the beam ; for example , small objects are part of the ` smooth ' component , not only in the limiting case where the smooth component consists of free elementary particles .",
    "the important point is that their angular size is small compared to that of the beam .",
    "@xmath7 is thus also a function of angle : the larger the angle , the more representative is the matter within the beam , so that @xmath7 approaches 1 for large enough angles .",
    "since the beams of supernovae at cosmological distances are extremely thin objects ( the thinnest objects ever studied by science ) , evidence for @xmath27 should be most obvious in the @xmath0@xmath1 relation for type  ia supernovae .    a given value of @xmath7 along a given line of sight does not imply that this value does not change along the line of sight , although that is of course a possibility , but rather that the influence on angle - dependent distances can be described by an effective value of @xmath7 which is some appropriate average of a value which varies along the line of sight .",
    "this means that it is possible for the density along the line of sight to be larger than the global density at some points , but this is not in contrast with the claim above that @xmath23 is not useful as long as the _ effective _ value @xmath28 .",
    "another complication is that essentially all lines of sight to supernovae will have a density higher than the globally average cosmological density due to the overdensities associated with the milky way and with the supernova host galaxy ( and corresponding clusters ) .",
    "however , since the absolute magnitudes of supernovae are not known from first principles , but rather calibrated from observations , this effect is , to a first approximation , unobservable , since it is essentially a renormalization of the absolute magnitude .",
    "even if this extra matter associated with the galaxies at the ends of the beam would increase the density inside the beam to larger than the global density , it is not useful to think of this as @xmath23 , since i want to compare the standard assumption ( completely homogeneous universe , at least as far as light propagation is concerned ) with that of a more realistic distribution .",
    "the point of comparison , the @xmath0@xmath1 relation for a homogeneous universe , also contains extra matter at each end of the beam , and hence extra convergence . as far as i know , no - one has ever taken this into account and it is not necessary if one is interested only in the differences .",
    "( this would have to be taken into account , though , if the absolute magnitude of objects at cosmological distances were known independently of observation . )",
    "although the term ` dark matter ' suggests something opaque , the defining characteristic is lack of interaction with electromagnetic radiation .",
    "thus , not only does dark matter not glow , it is also transparent .",
    "it is thus irrelevant whether dark - matter objects within the beam significantly cover a source as seen by an observer .",
    "( of course , when comparing observed to calculated brightness , one must correct for extinction due to ` conventional ' matter    it can also be dark in the sense that it does not radiate , but it is not transparent . ) here , i am using the term ` dark matter ' to refer to the ` missing matter ' , i.e.  that responsible for the difference between the density due to baryonic matter ( other non - baryonic but known particles ( neutrinos ) do not increase this significantly ) and the global density of the universe , as measured on large scales .",
    "of course , non - radiating baryonic matter does exist , but we know from constraints from big - bang nucleosynthesis that this can not be a significant fraction of the missing matter .",
    "this reflects current usage , e.g.  the ` dm ' in ` @xmath29cdm ' , and is more convenient than ` not yet identified non - baryonic matter ' .",
    "since we know that the universe is not exactly homogeneous and isotropic , @xmath30 is the most obvious departure from the simplest cosmological model ( the einstein  de  sitter model with @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath25 , although the last item is often not stated explicitly ) , but there is not much literature on this topic .",
    "( there are , though , several recent papers investigating whether ` dark energy ' could be something other than the traditional cosmological constant , e.g.  whether the equation of state @xmath33 differs from @xmath34 , whether it changes with time etc , even though there are no observations which indicate this . of course",
    ", that does not mean that one should not look . )    if @xmath7 is allowed to vary from one line of sight to another , one could regard this as an additional contribution to the uncertainty in the distance modulus , much the same as the uncertainty in the absolute magnitude . theoretically , fitting the observations for a constant value of @xmath7 would result in a worse fit for such cases if this additional uncertainty is ignored or in a larger allowed region of parameter space if it is included in the error budget . with some assumptions",
    ", one could try to take this additional dispersion into account and/or correct for it ; see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in practice , with a large number of objects and only a few variables , the difference in goodness of fit is well within the expected range of values for the case in which @xmath7 is the same along all lines of sight . alternatively , with current data",
    "it is also a relatively small contribution to the error budget .",
    "thus , if observations suggest @xmath35 , it would be unclear if this is evidence for the corresponding value of the global value of @xmath7 or whether this is a compromise between lines of sight with lower and higher values .",
    "however , if observations indicate @xmath36 or @xmath25 , then this would be evidence for the corresponding global value , because these are the extreme values of @xmath7 and can not result from averaging .    of course , more complicated models are possible . in this paper ,",
    "i consider only models in which @xmath7 is a constant function of redshift and the same along all lines of sight - dependent @xmath7 in the context of the @xmath0@xmath1 relation for type  ia supernovae . ] ; also , in all cases but one , it is independent of the other cosmological parameters .",
    "the variation between these models , however , is certainly larger than the realistic range of the possible influence of @xmath7 on the @xmath0@xmath1 relation for type  ia supernovae .",
    "the effects of a locally inhomogeneous universe on quantities important for observational cosmology were first investigated in a series of papers by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite discussed the special case of @xmath37 but with @xmath5  as a free parameter for @xmath36 ( where there is an analytic solution ) and for general @xmath7 values @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the distance for @xmath36 is sometimes referred to as the dyer ",
    "roeder distance .",
    "khs presented a second - order differential equation and numerical implementation valid for the general case ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) .",
    "kantowski and collaborators @xcite have stressed the importance of @xmath7 for the interpretation of the @xmath0@xmath1 relation for type  ia supernovae and have provided numerical implementations using elliptic integrals for the special values of @xmath7 of 0 , @xmath41 , and 1 .",
    "@xcite considered the effect of @xmath30 on their results ( see their fig .",
    "8) and concluded that , at least in the ` interesting ' region of the @xmath4@xmath5  parameter space , it had a negligible effect ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the reason for the current paper is that , with the larger number of supernovae now available , this is no longer the case .",

    "it has also been investigated , via  comparison with explicit ray - tracing through mass distributions derived from simulations or observations , whether @xmath7 is a useful parametrization  for local inhomogeneity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ( and the conclusion is that it is a useful approximation , at least for cosmological models which are otherwise realistic ) .",
    "there seem to be three schools with respect to the attitude taken to the possible influence of inhomogeneities on cosmological parameters derived from the @xmath0@xmath1 relation for type  ia supernovae .",
    "one school ignores it completely , assuming a completely homogeneous universe as far as the calculation of the luminosity distance is concerned ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or provides some limited justification for not considering it further ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "another school emphasizes that the problem is not completely understood , the amount of uncertainty is unknown , and even the sign of some effects is unclear ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a third school uses some approximation to at least get an idea of the size of possible effects ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "( while @xcite did consider the possible influence of @xmath7 , hence belonging to the third school , at least at that time , with their data then it was not a significant source of uncertainty in their main result .",
    "one purpose of this paper is to show that this is no longer the case . )",
    "i have used the publicly available ` union2.1 ' sample of supernova data @xcite and calculated @xmath42 and the associated probability following @xcite on regularly - spaced grids of various extents and resolutions in the @xmath4@xmath5@xmath7 parameter space .",
    "this _ assumes _ , of course , that @xmath7 is a free parameter on the same footing as @xmath4  and @xmath5 .",
    "my goal is not to obtain the ` best ' cosmological parameters , not even the ` best ' ones from the supernova data alone .",
    "rather , it is to investigate the influence of @xmath30 on the interpretation of the @xmath0@xmath1 relation for type  ia supernovae .",
    "i have thus intentionally made the supernova data as precise as possible , by using only the statistical uncertainties ( i.e.  column 4 in the publicly available data file ) and fixing @xmath6  at 70  kms@xmath43mpc@xmath43 , which implies @xmath44 .",
    "thus , all increase in the allowed region of parameter space ( at a given confidence level ) is due only to the influence of @xmath7 .  and @xmath5 , but rather to investigate the influence of @xmath7 on the constraints , i have retained the union 2.1 sample with which i began this investigation , rather than updating it to use , e.g. , that used by @xcite .",
    "those with better access to such data will always have a better sample than that which is publicly available .",
    "since even @xcite do not consider @xmath7 at all , it is perhaps important at the moment for a theorist to take a step back for a more general view in order to contrast with continual updates using somewhat better samples .",
    "it is important , though , that the union 2.1 sample is significantly larger than those used in the early works discussed in section  [ intro ] .",
    "]    i have calculated @xmath42 and the corresponding probability on two three - dimensional grids : a larger , lower - resolution grid @xmath45 and a smaller , higher - resolution grid @xmath46 ( this paper contains no plots based on the larger , lower - resolution grid ; the corresponding calculations were done to make sure that there is no appreciable probability outside of the range of the smaller , higher - resolution grid . ) since three - dimensional contours can not be fully represented in two dimensions , i present various two- and one - dimensional visualizations in order to illustrate the influence of @xmath7 .",
    "all contours in two ( three ) dimensions have been calculated as the smallest - area closed curve ( smallest - volume closed surface ) which encloses the corresponding fraction of the probability .",
    "i have used the standard values @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 ; these correspond to 1@xmath50 , 2@xmath50 and 3@xmath50 in the gaussian case .",
    "however , i have made no assumption about gaussianity , since i have calculated the contours explicitly , rather than plotting them at the corresponding fraction of the peak likelihood under the gaussian assumption .",
    "for all plots , the area outside of the plot has been assigned a probability of zero .",
    "otherwise , no priors other than those explicitly stated have been used . in particular , no prior information on the values of the cosmological parameters from other tests have been used ; what i show depends on the supernova data only .",
    "[ closeup - project - lo ] ,    [ closeup - project - le ] , and    [ closeup - project - oe ] show _ projections _ of the three - dimensional contours along one axis on to the plane spanned by the other two axes for the smaller , higher - resolution grid .",
    "it can be seen that the combination of @xmath4and @xmath5  is well constrained , as are both individually , while @xmath7 is hardly constrained at all .",
    "note also that @xmath4  and @xmath5  are less constrained for lower values of @xmath7 .",
    "( the contours at @xmath48 and @xmath49 can not be distinguished in these plots . )",
    "the relatively sharp bend in the lower right contours in figs .",
    "[ closeup - project - lo ] and [ closeup - project - le ] is due to the fact that i have assigned a probability of @xmath51 to models which have no big bang ( see the discussion of figs .  1 and 2 in @xcite and references therein for an explanation ) .",
    "another way of visualizing these three - dimensional contours is to make _ cuts _ through them for a fixed value of one of the parameters",
    ".    figs .",
    "[ closeup - cut-1-lo ] ,    [ closeup - cut-2-lo ] , and    [ closeup - cut-3-lo ] show cuts for @xmath52 .",
    "the contours become smaller and move to lower values of @xmath4  and @xmath5as @xmath7 becomes larger .",
    "( again , the contours at @xmath48 and @xmath49 can not be distinguished in these plots . )",
    "[ closeup - cut-3-lo ] is quite similar to standard presentations of the supernova constraints ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but keep in mind that these contours are a cut through the three - dimensional contours for a fixed value of @xmath7 , not two - dimensional contours . if @xmath7 is substantially less than 1 , then not only is the allowed region much larger , but the ` concordance model ' with @xmath2 and @xmath3 is ruled out .",
    "qualitatively , this behaviour is easy to understand : there is some degeneracy between @xmath7 and @xmath53 since both increase the amount of focusing in the beam , the former because there is more matter in the beam and the latter because of the increase in the global curvature , which is essentially @xmath53 .",
    "when there is essentially no matter in the beam , then the value of @xmath5  is less important and hence not as well constrained .",
    "this means that @xmath54 can be realized via  a larger range of each parameter , making the allowed region larger .",
    "the middle value of @xmath7 is that of the global maximum probability .",
    "( since @xmath4  and @xmath5  are better constrained , the corresponding plots for fixed values of these parameters , not shown here , are less interesting . )",
    "the ` standard procedure ' for reducing the number of parameters shown in a plot is to _ marginalize _ over the less interesting or ` nuisance ' parameters .",
    "this is shown in    figs .",
    "[ closeup - marginalize - lo ] ,    [ closeup - marginalize - le ] , and    [ closeup - marginalize - oe ] . here ,",
    "and in similar figures below , the grey - scale corresponds to the probability .. i have chosen to display this potentially important information in addition to the contour curves . ]",
    "these are qualitatively similar to the projections .",
    "[ closeup - marginalize - lo ] also contains two straight lines corresponding to a flat universe with @xmath55 ( negative slope ) and zero acceleration ( @xmath56 ) ( positive slope ) .",
    "note that a flat universe is compatible with the data but not required by them ; in fact , the degeneracy in the constraints is almost perpendicular to the flat - universe line . in this particular plot ,",
    "the degeneracy corresponds roughly to @xmath57 ; in many of the other plots , the degeneracy in the @xmath4@xmath5  plane is closer to a constant value of @xmath58 than to a constant value of @xmath59 .",
    "( @xmath60 was important historically since the departure from the linearity of the @xmath0@xmath1 relation at low redshift is proportional to @xmath60 ; nowadays quoting a value for @xmath60 derived from the @xmath0@xmath1 relation for higher - redshift objects is neither necessary nor sufficient nor , in general , meaningful . )",
    "another approach is to _ maximize _ the ` nuisance ' parameter , i.e.for a given point in the plane of the plot , find the value of the third parameter which maximizes the probability .",
    "this is shown in    fig .",
    "[ closeup - maximize - lo ] .",
    "( for these data , such plots are very similar to those where the third parameter has been marginalized over , so only this one example is shown . )    most discussion of the @xmath0@xmath1 relation for type  ia supernovae has concentrated not on contours of more than two dimensions , nor on some reduction ( projection , cut , marginalization , maximization ) of these higher - dimensional contours to two dimensions , but rather on two - dimensional contours , i.e.  with a @xmath61-function prior on the nuisance parameters . almost always , of course , the ( often implicitly assumed ) prior is @xmath62 .",
    "for comparison , in    figs .",
    "[ closeup - cut - etazero - lo ] ,    [ closeup - cut - etabest - lo ] , and    [ closeup - cut - etaone - lo ] i show constraints in the @xmath4@xmath5plane for fixed values of @xmath7 , namely 0 , 0.455 ( the value at the maximum of the three - dimensional probability distribution ) and 1 .",
    "the last should be compared with e.g.  fig .",
    "11 in @xcite , but keep in mind that , as mentioned above , i have fixed @xmath6  and use only the statistical uncertainties .",
    "( see also figs .",
    "1a and 5a in @xcite . )",
    "thus , fig .",
    "[ closeup - cut - etaone - lo ] has slightly smaller contours than similar plots elsewhere in the literature .",
    "again , this is intentional so that any deviations from this fiducial plot ( larger and/or shifted contours ) are due solely to the influence of @xmath7 .",
    "of course , little significance should be placed on variations in the probability within the innermost contour , since the probability that the point representing the true values of @xmath4  and @xmath5  is only about twice as likely to lie inside this contour than outside it .",
    "nevertheless , it is remarkable that the maximum of the probability in fig .",
    "[ closeup - cut - etaone - lo ] is at @xmath63 and @xmath64 , i.e.  at the values of the concordance model ( within the small uncertainties ; these are much smaller than even the @xmath65  per cent  contour in fig .",
    "[ closeup - cut - etaone - lo ] ) .",
    "note that when fewer supernova data were available , the best - fitting  value was at much higher values of @xmath4  and @xmath5 ; see e.g.  fig .  1 in @xcite .",
    "( as mentioned above , the best - fitting  value is often not visible in modern versions of such plots , though of course it can be easily found in the data used to make the plots . )",
    "if the best - fitting  value remains the same when significantly more supernova data are available , then very probably the true value will have been converged upon , even though the range of values allowed , even at the @xmath65  per cent  level , would include values well outside what is acceptable when other cosmological constraints are considered ( i.e.  joint constraints from several cosmological tests ) .",
    "normally , when more data are available one expects the new best - fittingvalue to be consistent with , but different from , the old best - fittingvalue , as has been the case with the supernova data up until now .",
    "however , looking towards the future , i do nt expect the best - fitting  values for @xmath4  and @xmath5  to change significantly , but do expect the constraints from the supernova data to improve , which appears somewhat puzzling .",
    "a possible explanation for this is that the statistical errors in the supernova data have been overestimated .",
    "note , however , that the best - fitting  values for the supernova data correspond to the concordance model only if one assumes @xmath66 . for @xmath67 ,",

    "the plots above illustrate that it is not possible to appreciably constrain @xmath7 from the supernova data alone .",
    "however , the fact that the supernova data suggest the concordance model only for high values of @xmath7 could be seen as evidence that @xmath66 .",
    "a similar result is shown in    fig .",

    "however , note that the best - fitting  value is for @xmath25 and @xmath72 ; in other words , again the best fit is for the concordance model with @xmath25 .",

    "the comparison illustrates vividly the fact that the effect of @xmath7 can no longer be neglected . while @xcite concluded that , at least in the interesting part of parameter space , the constraints on @xmath4  and @xmath5  from the supernova data did not depend heavily on the assumed value of @xmath7 , this is definitely no longer the case .    while the supernova data can not usefully constrain @xmath7 , as has been shown above",
    ", the fact that they result in the concordance model if one assumes @xmath66 suggests that @xmath66 .",
    "since there are many cosmological tests completely independent of the supernova data , and also independent of the value of @xmath7 , which suggest the concordance model ( this is of course why it is called the concordance model ) , one can assume the concordance values for @xmath4  and @xmath5and calculate the probability of @xmath7 from the supernova data with these additional constraints ; this is shown in    fig .",

    "even though the constraints on @xmath4  and @xmath5  are of course weaker if @xmath7 is allowed to vary , a significant portion of the three - dimensional parameter space can be ruled out , and portions of the @xmath4@xmath5  plane are also ruled out , though no additional region is ruled out which is not already ruled out by other cosmological tests . ] this suggests that @xmath7 is relatively large , even though the beams of supernovae at cosmological distances are extremely thin and this cosmological test should suggest a value of @xmath7 lower than that of any other cosmological test known today .",
    "one would not expect to obtain @xmath62 since some matter is associated with galaxies which are outside the beam ; such mass contributes about @xmath80 to @xmath5 .",
    "[ closeup - cut - concordance - e ] thus suggests that dark matter is distributed much more smoothly than galaxies .",
    "while the beam of a supernova at cosmological distance is almost a fair sample of the universe , it is an even fairer sample of dark matter .",
    "dark matter is thus not significantly clumped at the scale of a supernova beam .",
    "the following conclusions were more or less expected .",
    "* constraints on @xmath4  and @xmath5  are weaker if @xmath7 is not constrained . *",
    "the concordance model is reasonably probable .",

    "* @xmath4  is constrained best , then @xmath5 , then @xmath7 .",
    "the following conclusion was neither expected nor surprising .    *",
    "even when @xmath7 is allowed to be a free parameter , the @xmath0@xmath1 relation for type  ia supernovae is not compatible with @xmath81 , and thus implies that the universe is currently accelerating .",
    "( even though the @xmath0@xmath1 relation for type  ia supernovae is one of the key pieces of evidence supporting the cosmological ` concordance model ' with @xmath2 and @xmath82 , it is not an essential piece in the sense that combinations of other tests still result in the same concordance model .",
    "nevertheless , it is still an important piece of evidence in favour of the concordance model since it is the only single test which , without additional assumptions , implies @xmath83 , i.e.  a universe which is currently accelerating . )",
    "the following conclusions are somewhat surprising .    *",
    "the overall ( in the three - dimensional parameter space ) best - fitting   values for @xmath4  and @xmath5  are ruled out by other cosmological tests .",
    "probably , this best - fitting  point is the result of overfitting : its probability is not significantly higher than elsewhere and the allowed region is quite large . * if one _ assumes _",
    "@xmath84 then the best fit is very close to the concordance model _ and _ has @xmath62 . *",
    "if one _ assumes _",
    "@xmath62 , then the best fit is very close to the concordance model . *",
    "if one _ assumes _ the concordance model , then one can probably rule out low values of @xmath7 , even though the relevant scale is extremely small , which implies that dark matter is much less clustered than galaxies are . * we can not rule out @xmath62 , and there is some tentative evidence for it .    to summarize , allowing @xmath7 , which is otherwise only weakly constrained , as a free parameter significantly alters both the best fit in the @xmath4@xmath5  plane and the allowed region of this plane .",
    "the concordance model is , however , still allowed .",
    "there are hints that @xmath66 , though these are not statistically significant when examined in the three- or two - dimensional parameter space . on the other hand ,",
    "if one assumes the concordance values for @xmath4  and @xmath5 , low values of @xmath7 can probably be ruled out , which is not obvious considering the very small scales involved ; this implies that dark matter is very homogeneously distributed .",
    "one might have thought that the increase in the number of data points since @xcite would allow some sort of useful constraint to be placed on @xmath7 from the supernova data without further assumptions .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "even worse , if @xmath7 is allowed to vary , then the conclusions about the cosmological model derived from the @xmath0@xmath1 relation for type  ia supernovae are not as robust .",
    "as discussed in section  [ intro ] , current constraints from combinations of cosmological tests without using the supernova data determine the ` concordance model ' with @xmath2 and @xmath3 to rather high precision .",
    "it is thus perhaps more interesting to assume the concordance model and use the supernova data to constrain @xmath7 , especially since @xmath7 is otherwise difficult to measure . indeed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ closeup - cut - concordance - e ] , current data already provide interesting constraints .",
    "it is also extremely interesting that the supernova data have the best - fitting  values for @xmath4  and @xmath5corresponding to those of the concordance model if and only if @xmath85 is assumed .",
    "( note that while the best - fitting  value of @xmath7 assuming the concordance model is @xmath86 , the best - fitting  values of @xmath4  und @xmath5  assuming @xmath87 are different from those of the concordance model . )",
    "if this is not a statistical fluke , it could indicate that @xmath66 , which is somewhat surprising since the value of @xmath7 as ` felt ' by the supernova might be expected to be somewhat less , because the corresponding beams are extremely thin .",
    "the fact that even the supernova data ` want ' @xmath66 could indicate that dark matter is distributed extremely homogeneously .",
    "see @xcite for a different expression of the same idea .",
    "alternatively , this could be evidence that the ` safety in numbers ' scenario mentioned in section  [ theory ] is in fact a valid approximation .",
    "in contrast to the first useful determinations of @xmath4  and @xmath5from the @xmath0@xmath1 relation for type  ia supernovae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the effect of @xmath30 had a negligible effect on the constraints derived , at least in the ` interesting ' region of the @xmath4@xmath5  parameter space , with the larger number of supernovae now available , this is no longer the case .",
    "at the same time , current supernova data alone can not usefully constrain @xmath7 ( though this might be possible if other cosmological data are taken into consideration , as discussed in the previous paragraph ) .",
    "this should be taken into account in attempts to determine further parameters , such as @xmath33 , the equation - of - state parameter for dark energy .",
    "when more supernova data become available , especially at higher redshift , it might be possible to usefully constrain @xmath7 and/or discriminate between the effect of @xmath7 and other parameters such as @xmath33 .",
    "( the difference in apparent magnitude for different values of @xmath7 increases with increasing redshift , while the difference due to different values of @xmath4  and @xmath5  is stronger ( than that due to variation in @xmath7 ) at lower redshift and , for some sets of models , decreases at higher redshift . ) while allowing @xmath7 to be a free parameter , but constant as a function of redshift and for different lines of sight , is certainly not the last word with respect to the influence of locally inhomogeneous cosmological models on the @xmath0@xmath1 relation for type  ia supernovae , it does demonstrate that care is needed when interpreting conclusions derived from assuming @xmath25 . at least , the uncertainty in @xmath4  and @xmath5  must be correspondingly increased . while it might be possible to decrease this with a more realistic model , it is no longer possible to assume @xmath25 and have confidence in the parameters and their uncertainties resulting from an analysis of the @xmath0@xmath1 relation for type  ia supernovae .",
