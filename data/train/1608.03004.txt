    "relativistic fluid dynamics is an active and dynamical field of current research .",
    "the main areas of application are the arena of astrophysical phenomena @xcite and high energy nuclear collisions ( e.g quark - gluon plasma ) @xcite .",
    "a plethora of numerical methods have been developed for solving the relativistic variant of the ( macroscopic ) hydrodynamical conservation equations ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "an alternate approach that has become a popular choice in the past decades for non - relativistic fluid dynamics and recently for relativistic flows is to solve instead the boltzmann kinetic equation . in this approach",
    "the dynamical quantity is a one - particle distribution function , while the macroscopic quantities are obtained as moments of the distribution function .",
    "the non - linearity in the macroscopic equations is traded for the complexity of the phase space employed in the mesoscopic description , which in turn is mitigated by choosing efficient discretization schemes .",
    "these are called lattice boltzmann ( lb ) models .",
    "this approach has the advantage of mathematical simplicity , computational efficiency and the ability to handle complex geometries @xcite .",
    "furthermore , by using this description at the level of the boltzmann equation , we can accurately describe the evolution of nonequilibrium systems and of rarefied gases , where the hydrodynamic description is no longer applicable .",
    "traditional lattice boltzmann methods employ the collision - streaming paradigm @xcite .",
    "the essence of the method is to choose a finite set of momentum vectors ( or equivalently , velocities ) such that the constituents of the fluid move along the links of the spatial lattice .",
    "the set of velocities must have sufficient symmetry in order to exactly recover the macroscopic moments up to a desired order . to access physics beyond the hydrodynamic regime",
    ", higher - order moments must be recovered .",
    "the collision - streaming method is computationally very efficient , but has the flaw of being difficult to extend in terms of the number of velocities . in conventional on - lattice collision - streaming models ,",
    "this can be achieved by either using a larger set of velocities , implying jumps over an increasing number of neighbours on the spatial lattice @xcite , or by using multiple distribution functions @xcite .",
    "if we relax the requirement of having on - lattice velocities , we exchange some of the computational benefits for the freedom of choosing large sets of velocities .",
    "the lattice boltzmann models have been very popular for describing nonrelativistic fluid dynamics . in recent years",
    ", different lb models have also been developed for describing relativistic flows @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we employ the powerful technique of quadratures to select the set of momentum vectors .",
    "this approach has the advantage of being readily extendable to arbitrarily high orders of the quadrature , allowing the recovery of higher - order moments , thus granting access to the physics beyond the hydrodynamic regime .",
    "since typically , the resulting velocity sets are off - lattice , the advection in such models can no longer be performed using an exact streaming step , hence any of the powerful finite difference , finite element or finite volume methods developed for hyperbolic equations may be employed @xcite .",
    "most of these relativistic lb models ( rlb ) are of the collision - streaming type .",
    "we test our model on a particular case of the 1-dimensional riemann problem , called the sod shock - tube @xcite .",
    "the setup consists of two fluid domains at rest , having different pressures and densities , separated , e.g. , by a thin membrane .",
    "when the membrane is removed , a shock - wave and a rarefaction wave propagate in opposite directions . due to these features ,",
    "the riemann problem is a challenging trial for numerical methods .",
    "in order to simulate the relativistic flow of massless particles on minkowski space - time , we use the relativistic boltzmann equation @xcite : @xmath0 where the right hand side represents the anderson - witting approximation for the collision term @xcite , while @xmath1 is the particle four - momentum , obeying the mass - shell condition for the minkowski metric , as well as planck units , such that @xmath2 . ]",
    "@xmath3 . in this paper",
    ", we consider the relaxation time @xmath4 to be constant .",
    "furthermore , we only consider the simple setup of the one - dimensional riemann problem in flat spacetime , such that the distribution function can be taken to be homogeneous with respect to the perpendicular directions @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the boltzmann equation thus simplifies to : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the particle velocity along the @xmath9 axis .",
    "the equilibrium distribution function is taken to be the maxwell - jttner distribution for massless particles : @xmath10 the hydrodynamic fields which describe the macroscopic state of the fluid are obtained as moments of the distribution function : @xmath11 the equilibrium particle 4-flow and stress - energy tensor ( set ) corresponding to is of the perfect fluid form : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the particle number density , @xmath14 is the energy density and @xmath15 is the hydrostatic pressure , written in terms of the macroscopic temperature @xmath16 .",
    "the macroscopic velocity of the fluid @xmath17 is defined such that it reinforces the conservation of the set .",
    "it can be seen by multiplying ( [ boltz_gen ] ) with @xmath18 and integrating with the appropriate measure , that the correct choice is determined by the landau - lifshitz condition @xcite : @xmath19",
    "at the core of the lattice boltzmann method lies the discretization of the momentum space , which is performed such that certain moments of the equilibrium distribution function @xmath20 are exactly recovered .",
    "achieving this goal is a two - step procedure : first , a quadrature procedure must be defined by means of which the integrals over the momentum space can be performed exactly ; the second step consists in replacing the collision term by a finite polynomial compatible with the quadrature scheme , such that its moments are exactly recovered .",
    "the details of these two steps can be found in the subsequent subsections .      in order to perform an expansion of @xmath20 , eq .",
    "( [ feqmj ] ) can be cast as follows : @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , with @xmath25 being a reference temperature .",
    "the form ( [ feq ] ) lends itself to a decomposition with respect to spherical coordinates , similar to that performed in ref.@xcite for the nonrelativistic case . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "such a decomposition is performed also for the relativistic case , using generalized laguerre polynomials @xmath26 of order 3 for the radial component @xmath27 and vector polynomials @xmath28 for the angular part , which is specifically designed to recover the stress - energy tensor .",
    "we perform here a similar decomposition , but using generalized laguerre polynomials of order 1 , allowing us to build quadratures that grant access also to the particle 4-flow @xmath29 , as opposed to just the set @xmath30 , as is the case in ref.@xcite . for information on the laguerre polynomials",
    "see , e.g. , ref.@xcite .",
    "the first few vector polynomials are listed in ref.@xcite and they can be obtained up to arbitrary orders by algebraic means .",
    "the expansion of @xmath20 can be performed as follows : @xmath31 where the exact expression of the expansion coefficients @xmath32 is omitted here for brevity . truncating the above expansion at order @xmath33 with respect to the radial component @xmath27 and at order @xmath34 with respect to the angular components @xmath35 ensures the exact recovery of moments of the form : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a polynomial of order at most @xmath38 in @xmath27 and @xmath39 in @xmath35 .",
    "the procedure for the recovery of the above moments is discussed in the following subsection .      to recover the moments given in eq .",

    "the procedure is explained in detail in refs.@xcite .",
    "the quadrature relations are exact if the integrand in ( [ azimuthint ] ) contains combinations of @xmath42 and @xmath43 at combined powers of less than @xmath44 , the function @xmath45 contains powers of @xmath46 of less than @xmath47 and @xmath48 is a polynomial in @xmath27 of order less than @xmath49 . for the truncation ( [ feqtrunc ] ) , we have the absolute conditions @xmath50 and @xmath51 @xcite . the above quadrature rules are valid for any set of orthogonal polynomials that are defined on the appropriate domain .",
    "we have chosen a simple trigonometric quadrature for the azimuthal integral @xcite , legendre polynomials for the polar angle ( gauss - legendre quadrature @xcite ) and laguerre polynomials for the radial integral ( gauss - laguerre quadrature @xcite ) .",
    "the functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 are called _",
    "quadrature weigths_. the discrete set of momenta are given by @xmath54 while @xmath55 and @xmath56 are zeroes of legendre and laguerre functions , i.e. @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "thus , the complete set of discrete momenta comprises the following elements ( in spherical coordinates ) : @xmath59 the total number of velocities is equal to @xmath60 .",
    "to test our models , we perform simulations of the riemann problem with the following initial conditions : @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "open boundary conditions are imposed along the axis parallel to the flow ( i.e. the @xmath9 axis ) and periodic conditions in the perpendicular directions @xcite .    in order to determine the quadrature order to be employed for the recovery of the dynamics of @xmath29 and @xmath30",
    ", we consider the projection of eq .   on the polynomial @xmath64 : @xmath65 where @xmath66 are the expansion coefficients of @xmath67 with respect to the laguerre polynomials , defined through :",
    "@xmath68 while @xmath69 are defined in a similar way in terms of @xmath20 .",
    ".   shows that the evolution of @xmath66 is fully determined by @xmath66 and @xmath69 .",
    "since @xmath29 and @xmath30 are moments of order @xmath70 and @xmath71 with respect to @xmath72 , respectively , their evolution is fully determined by the evolution of @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "thus , the evolution of @xmath29 and @xmath30 can be exactly recovered using a quadrature of order @xmath76 on the @xmath72 coordinate .",
    "further , the @xmath77 coordinate can only appear through combinations of @xmath78 and @xmath79 . since eq .",
    ", as well as the initial conditions , do not contain @xmath78 and @xmath79 , the quadrature order along the @xmath77 direction can be taken to be @xmath80 . furthermore , since we only require the evolution of the @xmath81 and @xmath9 components of @xmath30 , a quadrature order @xmath82 is sufficient .",
    "the quadrature order @xmath83 along the @xmath84 direction is left as a variable which we will use to control the accuracy of our lb simulations , as will be described in the next section .",
    "the discretization of the time - derivative in ( [ boltz ] ) is done using an explicit , nonlinearly stable 3rd order runge - kutta algorithm @xcite . for the spatial discretization",
    "we use a 5th order weno scheme @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the weno scheme is suitable when simulating flows with discontinuities or strong gradients , in effect suppressing spurious oscillations and reducing numerical viscosity @xcite .",
    "the spatial domain is set to unity and we chose a grid consisting of @xmath85 nodes , while the time step is limited by the cfl condition @xcite .    in the * hydrodynamic regime * , the riemann problem is well studied @xcite .",
    "the results of our simulations for the initial conditions with @xmath86 , time - step @xmath87 and a number of @xmath88 nodes along the @xmath9 axis can be seen in fig .",
    "[ evolution](a ) .",
    "as the fluid evolves , we observe the formation of a rarefaction wave , a contact discontinuity and a shock - wave . in ideal hydrodynamics ,",
    "the shock - wave represents a discontinuity in the density and pressure .",
    "as is the case in all bgk - type lb models , the viscosity depends linearly on the relaxation time @xmath4 .",
    "thus , in numerical simulations with a finite @xmath4 , the shock ( and contact discontinuity ) will always become smoothed as a consequence of this non - vanishing viscosity .",
    "the width of the shock - wave is a good measure of the numerical accuracy of the model . in our case ,",
    "the width is equal to around 6 - 7 grid nodes , which represents a distance of @xmath89 . to obtain the aforementioned results",

    "( [ condinit ] ) , the density profile in the ballistic regime is given by : @xmath95 figure  [ rconv](b ) shows the convergence trend of our simulation results as @xmath83 is increased . the agreement between the case",
    "when @xmath93 and the above analytic result is excellent .    with our model , we can also capture the evolution of the fluid at * finite relaxation times * , where viscous and rarefaction effects become significant . in fig .",
    "[ rconv](a ) , we have represented the density profile of the fluid at time @xmath96 , for different values of the relaxation time .",
    "as @xmath4 increases , and thus the system becomes more dissipative , the features are smoothed . as we go towards increasing values of the relaxation time @xmath4 ,",
    "increasing quadrature orders are required for the recovery of the physics of the flow . in order to asses the capability of a model of given @xmath83 to simulate the riemann problem , we considered the following quantity @xcite : @xmath97 ,   \\label{eq : err}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 and @xmath99 is a `` reference '' density profile . in the absence of an analytic expression for @xmath100",
    ", we have considered the profile obtained using a large quadrature order , i.e.  @xmath93 .",
    "the quantity @xmath101 thus represents the maximum relative deviation of the profile @xmath102 obtained with a model of a given @xmath83 from the reference profile @xmath99 , obtained using @xmath93 .",
    "figure  [ rconv](b ) shows the dependence of @xmath101 on @xmath103 for various values of @xmath4 .",
    "it can be seen that the quadrature order required to reduce @xmath101 under the @xmath104 threshold ( where we consider that _ convergence _ is achieved ) increases as @xmath4 increases . in the hydrodynamic regime ( @xmath86 )",

    "all results presented in fig .  [ rconv ] were obtained using @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "we have developed a quadrature - based lattice boltzmann model for simulating relativistic flows .",
    "the model was tested on a version of the classical riemann problem ( i.e.  the sod shock tube ) .",
    "the results obtained in the hydrodynamic regime are consistent with those in the literature , while in the ballistic regime , we show that our models recover the analytic result . in order to asses the accuracy of our models for finite values of the relaxation time @xmath4 ,",
    "we have considered a convergence test which requires the relative error with respect to some reference profile obtained using a @xmath106-point quadrature to be below @xmath104 .",
    "we have shown that , in the hydrodynamic regime , a small order of the quadrature is sufficient to obtain convergence , while in the ballistic regime , the convergence is slow .",
