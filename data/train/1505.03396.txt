    "for a graph @xmath7 let us denote by @xmath8 , its full automorphism group .",
    "a labeling of vertices of a graph @xmath9 is said to be * distinguishing * ( or @xmath6-distinguishing ) provided no nontrivial automorphism of the graph preserves all of the vertex labels . the * distinguishing number * of the graph @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath10 , is the minimum @xmath6 such that @xmath0 has an @xmath6-distinguishing labeling ( see @xcite ) .",
    "collins and trenk introduced the notion of the * distinguishing chromatic number * in @xcite , as the minimum number of colors @xmath6 , needed to color the vertices of the graph so that the coloring is both proper and distinguishing . in other words ,",
    "the distinguishing chromatic number is the least integer @xmath6 such that the vertex set can be partitioned into sets @xmath11 such that each @xmath12 is independent in @xmath0 , and for every @xmath13 there exists some color class @xmath12 such that @xmath14 .",
    "the problem of determining the distinguishing chromatic number of a graph @xmath0 , or at least good bounds for it , has been one of considerable interest in recent times ( @xcite ) .",
    "clearly , the notion of the distinguishing chromatic number begins to get more interesting only if the graph admits a large group of automorphisms , in which case , it can vary substantially from the usual chromatic number .",
    "it is known ( see @xcite ) that @xmath15 if and only if @xmath0 is complete multipartite .",
    "consequently , it is simple to see that there exist graphs @xmath0 with @xmath16 , for any @xmath17 since for instance , a disjoint union of a clique of size @xmath18 and @xmath19 achieves the same . some upper bounds for @xmath1 ( for instance , a version of brooks theorem for the distinguishing chromatic number ) appear in @xcite , which also includes the inequality @xmath20 .",
    "however , in many interesting large naturally occurring families of graphs , we have @xmath21 ( see @xcite ) .    in this paper , we seek to address three aspects of the problem of determining @xmath1 for a given graph @xmath0 .",
    "firstly , we prove a lemma that may be considered a variant of what is now well known as the motion lemma , first introduced in @xcite .",
    "the motion lemma basically says that if every nontrivial automorphism of a graph moves ` many ' vertices then its distinguishing number is small .",
    "a similar lemma also appears in the context of graph endomorphisms and ` endomorphism breaking ' in @xcite . as a result of our variant of the motion lemma ,",
    "we give examples of several families of graphs @xmath0 satisfying @xmath3 .",
    "secondly , we contrast the relation between the size of the automorphism group @xmath8 of a graph with its distinguishing chromatic number @xmath1 . a result describing",
    "an upper bound for @xmath1 in terms of the prime factors of @xmath22 appears in @xcite .",
    "however , our perspective is somewhat different .",
    "we demonstrate instances of families of graphs @xmath0 such that @xmath0 have large chromatic number , and @xmath3 even though @xmath22 is not very large ( we have @xmath23 ) . as a contrast , we also demonstrate a family of graphs with arbitrarily large chromatic number , with ` super large ' automorphism groups for which _ every _ proper coloring of @xmath0 with @xmath4 colors is in fact distinguishing .",
    "this latter example also addresses a point raised in @xcite and these contrasting results indicate that the relation between @xmath22 and @xmath1 can tend to be somewhat haphazard .",
    "finally , as we indicated earlier , while it is simple to give ( the trivial ) examples of graphs @xmath0 with @xmath24 , for any @xmath25 , non - trivial examples are a little harder to come by . clearly , adding a copy ( not necessarily disjoint ) of a large complete multipartite graph to an arbitrary graph achieves this goal but such examples",
    ", we shall consider ` trivial ' since the reason for the blowing - up of the distinguishing chromatic number is trivially attributed to the presence of the complete multipartite component . while it seems simple to qualitatively",
    "ascribe the notion of what constitutes a nontrivial example in this context , we find it somewhat tedious to describe it precisely .",
    "our last result in this paper describes what we would like to believe constitutes a nontrivial family of bipartite graphs @xmath0 such that @xmath26 , for any @xmath27 .",
    "it turns out that large complete bipartite graphs do appear as induced subgraphs in our examples , but that alone does not guarantee that the distinguishing chromatic number necessarily increases .",
    "furthermore , what makes these nontrivial in our opinion , is the fact that the distinguishing chromatic number of these graphs is more than what one might initially guess .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we state and prove what we regard as a variant of the motion lemma and use this to establish instances of families of graphs with @xmath3 in section 3 . in section 4 , we describe two families of graphs - @xmath28 and @xmath29 with rather contrasting properties . for @xmath30",
    ", we have @xmath3 even though @xmath23 ; for @xmath31 , @xmath32 and yet every proper @xmath4 coloring of @xmath0 is in fact distinguishing . in section 5",
    ", we describe a family of bipartite graphs for which @xmath26 , for any @xmath33 .",
    "the last section contains some concluding remarks and open questions .",
    "following @xcite , we recall that the motion of an automorphism @xmath34 is defined as @xmath35 and the motion of a graph @xmath0 is defined as @xmath36 the motion lemma of @xcite states that for a graph @xmath0 , if @xmath37 then @xmath0 is @xmath38distinguishable .",
    "we prove a slightly more general criterion to obtain a similar conclusion for the distinguishing chromatic number .    for a graph @xmath0 with full automorphism group @xmath8 ,",
    "let @xmath39 be a subgroup of the automorphism group .",
    "for @xmath40 and @xmath41 we define @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "let @xmath44 .",
    "the _ orbit of a vertex @xmath45 with respect to an automorphism @xmath46 _ is the set @xmath47 where @xmath48    [ motionlemma ] let @xmath49 be a proper coloring of the graph @xmath0 with @xmath4 colors and let @xmath50 be a color class in @xmath49 .",
    "let @xmath51 be the subgroup of @xmath8 consisting of all automorphisms that fix the color class @xmath50 . for each @xmath52 ,",
    "let @xmath53 denote the total number of distinct orbits induced by the automorphism @xmath46 in the color class @xmath50 .",

    "for each @xmath60 pick uniformly and independently , an element in @xmath61 and color @xmath45 using that color . keep the labeling of all other vertices intact .",
    "this creates @xmath62 additional color classes .",
    "this new coloring @xmath63 of @xmath0 is clearly proper ; we claim that with positive probability , it is also distinguishing .    for @xmath40 ,",
    "let @xmath64 denote the event that @xmath46 fixes every color class .",
    "observe that if @xmath46 fixes a color class containing a vertex @xmath65 then all other vertices in the set @xmath66 are also in the same color class .",
    "moreover the probability that @xmath67 is in the same color class of @xmath65 equals @xmath68 .",
    "then @xmath69    let @xmath70 denote the set of all automorphisms which fixes every color classes in @xmath63 and let @xmath71 . then note that @xmath72 if @xmath73 then there exist a @xmath74 proper coloring of @xmath0 satisfying @xmath75 . since @xmath76 is in fact a subgroup of @xmath51 , @xmath77 divides @xmath55 , so if @xmath73 it follows then that with positive probability , @xmath78 , so the coloring @xmath63 is distinguishing .    in particular",
    ", since @xmath79 it follows from equation ( [ preqn ] ) that @xmath80 thus , if @xmath58 then there exist a distinguishing proper @xmath74 coloring of the graph .",
    "in this subsection , we restrict our attention to desarguesian projective planes and consider the levi graphs of these projective planes , which are the bipartite incidence graphs corresponding to the set of points and lines of the projective plane .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the theorem of desargues is valid in a projective plane if and only if the plane can be constructed from a three dimensional vector space over a skew field , which in the finite case reduces to the three dimensional vector spaces over finite fields .    in order to describe the graphs we are interested in , we set up some notation .",
    "let @xmath81 denote the finite field of order @xmath82 , and let us denote the vector space @xmath83 over @xmath81 by @xmath84 .",
    "let @xmath85 be the set of @xmath59-dimensional subspaces of @xmath84 and @xmath86 , the set of @xmath87-dimensional subspaces of @xmath84 .",
    "we shall refer to the members of these sets by points and lines , respectively .",
    "the _ levi graph _ of order @xmath82 , denoted by @xmath88 is a bipartite graph defined as follows : @xmath89 , where this describes the partition of the vertex set ; a point @xmath90 is adjacent to a line @xmath91 if and only if @xmath92 .    the fundamental theorem of projective geometry @xcite states that the full group of automorphisms of the projective plane @xmath93 is induced by the group of all non - singular semi - linear transformations @xmath94 of @xmath84 onto @xmath95 where @xmath84 is the corresponding vector space of @xmath93 .",
    "if @xmath96 for a prime number @xmath90 , @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the galois group of @xmath99 over @xmath100 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath82 is a prime , we have @xmath101 the upshot is that @xmath88 admits a large group of automorphisms , namely , @xmath94 .",
    "we first show that the distinguishing chromatic number for the levi graphs @xmath88 is precisely @xmath102 in almost all the cases .",
    "this is somewhat reminiscent of the result of @xcite for the distinguishing number of affine spaces .",
    "@xmath103 for all prime powers @xmath104    firstly , we consider the case when @xmath105 and @xmath82 is prime and show that @xmath106 consider a 2-coloring of @xmath88 by assigning color @xmath59 to the point set @xmath107 and color @xmath87 to the line set @xmath108 .",
    "it is easy to see that an automorphism of @xmath88 that maps @xmath85 into itself and @xmath86 into itself corresponds to an automorphism of the underlying projective plane , and hence any such automorphism is necessarily in @xmath109 ( by the preceding remarks ) .    in order to use lemma [ motionlemma ] ,",
    "observe that , any @xmath110 fixes at most @xmath111 points of @xmath88 .",
    "hence @xmath112 consequently , @xmath113 * case 1 : * @xmath114 + for @xmath115 the right hand side of [ eqnlevi5 ] is approximately @xmath116 since the right hand side of inequality [ eqnlevi5 ] is monotonically decreasing in @xmath82 , it follows that @xmath117 for @xmath118 , hence by lemma [ motionlemma ] @xmath88 admits a proper distinguishing @xmath119coloring .",

    "we include these proofs in the appendix for the sake of completeness .",
    "if @xmath132 for @xmath133 and a prime @xmath90 , we note that the cardinality of the automorphism group of @xmath93 equals @xmath134    as in the prime case , we have @xmath135    for @xmath136 and @xmath137 the right hand side is approximately @xmath138 by the same arguments as in the preceding section , it follows that @xmath139    for @xmath140 we calculate @xmath126 for @xmath141 and @xmath142 using sage to make the actual computation , so we have @xmath143 .",

    "so , we now consider the other possibility , namely that @xmath595 and @xmath601 are in different color classes .    _ case ii : _ @xmath607 and @xmath603 have the same color but @xmath595 and @xmath601 are in different color classes , say blue and green respectively .",
    "here we first note that @xmath623 and @xmath624 are necessarily red because they belong to @xmath595 and @xmath601 respectively .",
    "again , we are led to three subcases : + _ sub case 1 : _ @xmath630 and @xmath639 are both colored blue . here",
    ", it is a straightforward check to see that every @xmath640 is colored green .",
    "then , one can check that @xmath641 fixes every color class .",
    "+ _ sub case 2 : _ the point @xmath630 is colored red and @xmath642 is colored blue .",
    "again , one can check in a straightforward manner , that for all @xmath643 , @xmath644 is colored green .",
    "if @xmath599 is blue then @xmath645 does the job . if @xmath599 is colored green , @xmath646 does the job .",
    "+ _ sub case 3 : _",
    "@xmath639 is colored red and @xmath630 is colored blue . here",
    "we first observe that @xmath647 are all necessarily green . also , by the underlying assumption ( characterizing case ii ) , @xmath648 bear the same color . in this case ,",
    "@xmath649 , does the job .",
    "this exhausts all the possibilities , and hence we are through .          as indicated earlier we denote the points @xmath505 as mentioned in the beginning of this section .",
    "a line corresponding to the subspace @xmath652 is denoted @xmath653 .",
    "we color the graph using the colors @xmath654 as in figure [ lg3 ] ( the color is indicated in a rectangular box corresponding to the vertex )           here the first row lists all the points in the projective plane of order @xmath102 .",
    "the column corresponding to the vertex @xmath505 lists the set of lines @xmath507 such that @xmath92 , so that the columns are the adjacency lists for the vertices in @xmath85 . to see that this coloring is distinguishing , firstly ,",
    "observe that the line @xmath655 is the only vertex with color @xmath656 therefore , any automorphism @xmath2 that fixes every color class necessarily fixes this line .",
    "consequently , the points on @xmath655 are mapped by @xmath2 onto themselves . since each point on @xmath655 bears a different color",
    ", it follows that @xmath2 fixes each @xmath657 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath658 @xmath2 maps each set @xmath659 onto itself . here , @xmath660 denotes the set of lines adjacent to the @xmath310 point of @xmath661 but again note that by the coloring indicated , the vertices @xmath662 and @xmath663 have different colors for each @xmath292 , so @xmath664 for each pair @xmath665 with @xmath666 .",
