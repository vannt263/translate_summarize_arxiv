    "( the variation with respect to @xmath9 gives nothing new but the trace of the equation obtained by varying with respect to @xmath10 . )",
    "then we impose the flatness of the metric @xmath11 and choose null coordinates @xmath12 . in this way",
    "the 4d line element takes the form @xmath13 and the equations are :    @xmath14    here commas denote derivatives and we have introduced the notation : @xmath15 in deriving eq .",

    "waugh and lake@xcite has shown that a closed form of this solution can be given in double null coordinates only for linear and exponential mass functions .",

    "( [ massvaidya ] ) that the scalar field has to be also a linear or exponential function in order to be able to integrate the second equation ( [ rv ] ) .",

    "it is immediate to show that the same property holds for @xmath25 and @xmath77 .",
    "the killing vector is @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is a constant .",
    "thus the equations ( [ pp])-([pn ] ) lead to the system of ordinary differential equations : @xmath93    we introduce timelike and spacelike coordinates @xmath94 and @xmath95 respectively by @xmath96 in terms of which the metric is @xmath97 .",
    "there are two cases to discuss : @xmath98 when all metric functions depend only on @xmath95 ( static case ) or @xmath99 when they depend solely on @xmath94 ( homogeneous case ) .",
    "@xmath100 we have discussed this case in detail in @xcite .",
    "the fact that the dilaton @xmath101 has only radial dependence suggests to introduce @xmath47 as a new radial coordinate .",
    "the metric becomes @xmath102 , where the metric function @xmath103 is defined by the differential equation @xmath104    by introducing the notation @xmath105 we recover from ( [ 1var ] ) the equations @xmath106 of @xcite .",
    "@xmath107 now the dilaton depends only on time .",
    "we introduce @xmath47 as a new time variable and obtain the metric @xmath108 , where the metric function @xmath109 is defined similarly to ( [ fdefstat ] ) : @xmath110 from ( [ 1var ] ) we find equations very much similar to @xmath106 of @xcite .",
    "both are written concisely as : @xmath111 where @xmath112 refers to the static case and @xmath113 to the homogeneous case .",
    "the solving procedure of this system follows closely @xcite , with the only difference in the definition of the new variables @xmath114 and @xmath115 allowed to take either positive or negative values .",
    "we find @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are constants and eq .",
    "( [ rl ] ) determines @xmath47 as function of @xmath119",
    "the metric ( [ metricrl ] ) , either static ( then @xmath94 replaces @xmath95 and @xmath120 is a radial coordinate ) or homogeneous , has a true singularity at @xmath121 although the ricci scalar vanishes @xmath122 , other scalars , like @xmath123 and the kretschmann scalar @xmath124 which has the denominator @xmath125 are ill - behaved at @xmath121    the 4d interpretation of the source is again twofold .",
    "first we have the general picture of colliding null dust streams , valid even without the assumption of a killing vector .",
    "second we can interpret the source as an anisotropic fluid with no tangential pressures and both the energy density and radial pressure equal to @xmath126 ( these also became infinite at @xmath127 ) .    note , that in contrast with @xcite , the transcendental function @xmath128 is _ not _ constrained to be positive . in the static case , because @xmath129 , the negative values of @xmath120 lead just to an other copy of the solution written in @xcite for positive @xmath120 , as was explained in@xcite .",
    "the consequences in the homogeneous case are deeper , as will be seen in what follows .",
    "a natural requirement the new time variable @xmath120 should satisfy is to be a monotonous function of @xmath94 . from ( [ rl ] )",
    "the relation @xmath130 emerges . by fixing the sign in the square root of eq .",
    "( [ fdefhom ] ) appropriately ( @xmath131 for @xmath132 and @xmath133 for @xmath134 ) , we get @xmath135 . in conclusion @xmath136 an other remark is that at @xmath137 the function @xmath138 vanishes , thus the metric written in the coordinates @xmath139 has a coordinate singularity , which however does not appear in the form ( [ metricrl ] ) of the metric , when the coordinates @xmath140 are employed .",
    "this feature is closely related to the fact that both the transformations @xmath141 and @xmath142 are ill - behaved at @xmath143 , whereas the direct transformation @xmath144 , given by ( [ ttol ] ) , is regular .",
    "a delicate issue is the signature of the metric ( [ metricrl ] ) . to have a homogeneous metric @xmath145 with @xmath120 as time and @xmath95 as radial coordinate , as claimed ,",
    "the condition @xmath146 should be fulfilled .",
    "this translates to have @xmath120 confined to a finite range @xmath147 as can be seen on fig.1 . from the numerical plot of ( [ rl ] ) .",
    "the constant @xmath148 provides a scale as in the static case .",
    "the other constant @xmath117 shifts the admissible domain of @xmath120 to negative values when @xmath149 and conversely .",
    "the singularity is on the boundaries @xmath150 of the admissible range of @xmath119    the function @xmath47 is the time - dependent radius of the kantowski - sachs type homogeneous universe described by ( [ metricrl ] ) .",
    "it is first increasing to a maximum value after which it decreases to zero .",
    "this universe filled by a two - component radiation is born from a singularity and collapses into an other singularity .",
    "the author wishes to thank z. perjs for comments on the manuscript , m. bradley for a remark and for the warm hospitality encountered in the relativity group at the university of utah , where the first part of this research was completed .",
