    "( [ eq4.2 ] ) and ( [ eq4.4 ] ) we find for the chiral condensate in the massless limit : @xmath65 the non - zero value of the chiral condensate can be interpreted as the generation of a dynamical fermion mass which , in principle , can be extracted from the non - zero chiral condensate in the chiral limit . +        in the determination of the value of the chiral condensate , as given in eq .",

    "the latter value is one order of magnitude bigger than the former and can not be attributed to finite size effects , in consideration of the similar lattice sizes adopted in the two determinations .",

    "in this section we attempt to apply our numerical determination of the chiral condensate in the chiral limit to graphene immersed in a transverse magnetic field . for the reader s",
    "convenience , we briefly discuss the remarkable quantum hall effect in graphene .",
    "+ as is well known , graphene is a flat monolayer of carbon atoms tightly packed in a two dimensional honeycomb lattice consisting of two interpenetrating triangular sublattices ( for a review , see ref .",
    "indeed , the structure of graphene has attracted considerable attention since the low - energy excitations are given by two pauli spinors @xmath73 which satisfy the massless two - dimensional dirac equation with the speed of light replaced by the fermi velocity @xmath74 cm / s .",
    "the pauli spinors can be combined into a single dirac spinor @xmath75 .",
    "taking into account the real spin degeneracy , we see that the low - energy dynamics of graphene can be accounted for by @xmath17 massless dirac fields  @xcite . +        when graphene is immersed in a transverse magnetic field , the relativistic massless dispersion of the electronic wave functions results in non - equidistant landau levels : @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 being the elementary charge ( see fig .",
    "[ fig-3 ] , left ) .",
    "the presence of anomalous landau levels at zero energy , @xmath79 , leads to half - integer quantum hall effect corresponding to quantized filling factor @xmath80 .",
    "+ recent studies of quantum hall effect in graphene in very strong magnetic field @xmath81 ( 1 t = @xmath82 gauss ) have revealed new quantum hall states corresponding to filling factor @xmath83  @xcite .",
    "the new plateaus at @xmath84 can be explained by zeeman spin splitting . on the other hand",
    "the @xmath85 plateaus are associated with the spontaneous breaking of the symmetry in the @xmath86 landau levels ( the so - called _ valley _ symmetry ) .",
    "indeed , these states are naturally explained if there is dynamical generation of a gap @xmath87 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig-3 ] , right ) .",
    "+ the gap @xmath87 can be extracted from the measured activation energy .",
    "in fact , in fig .",
    "[ fig-4 ] we display the measured activation energy gap @xmath88 as a function of the magnetic field for the @xmath89 quantum hall states  @xcite .",
    "to extract @xmath87 from the activation energy data , we need to take care of the zeeman energy which for strong magnetic fields is no more negligible . to this end , we may fit the data to :        @xmath90    where @xmath91 is the bohr magneton , @xmath92 and @xmath93  @xcite .",

    "+ our strategy is , now , to relate the gap @xmath87 to the chiral condensate .",
    "after that , using our determination of the chiral condensate on the lattice , we will estimate the gap and compare with the experimental determination eq .",
    "( [ eq5.3 ] ) .",
    "+ to this purpose we follow ref .",
    "@xcite , where the hypothesis of rearrangement of the dirac sea of graphene in an external magnetic field was used and the electron - electron coulomb interactions were neglected . note that in graphene the electron - electron coulomb interaction , @xmath96 , in general is not small , so that this approximation could be questionable .",
    "a direct calculation gives  @xcite : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the euler gamma function and @xmath99 is the generalized riemann zeta function . for small gap",
    ", we may expand to the first order in @xmath87 . using @xmath100 and @xmath101 ,",
    "we get : @xmath102 this last equation relates the gap @xmath87 to the rescaled dimensionless chiral condensate . using our determination on the lattice for the rescaled chiral condensate ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is given in eq .",
    "( [ eq4.4 ] ) .",
    "finally , with the experimental value for the fermi velocity we get : @xmath105 comparing eq .",
    "( [ eq5.7 ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ eq5.3 ] ) , we see that our estimate of the gap is about a factor five smaller than the experimental data .",
    "however , it is remarkable that we are able to reproduce the dependence on the external magnetic field @xmath106 .",
    "we investigated planar quantum electrodynamics with two degenerate staggered fermions in an external magnetic field on the lattice .",
    "our numerical results seem to indicate that in an external magnetic field there is a non - zero chiral condensate in the chiral limit pointing to a dynamical generation of mass for two - dimensional massless dirac fermions .",
    "we performed our simulations in the weak - coupling regime of the compact formulation of the lattice gauge action .",
    "as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the _ non - compact _ formulation of the theory could have a different continuum limit than the compact one , the signature of this being the different magnetic monopole dynamics , which in compact qed leads to an enhanced chiral condensate . as a matter of fact , in the compact theory",
    "the chiral condensate is non - zero in the strong - coupling regime and undergoes a crossover to a non - zero value in the weak - coupling regime , while in the weak - coupling regime of the non - compact theory it is compatible with zero .",
    "although we believe that the numerical impact of this possible different behaviour in the continuum should be negligible to our purposes , we plan to explicitly check this point by performing numerical simulations with the non - compact lattice gauge action .",
    "this will also permit us to make a comparison with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , where a different approach was adopted to introduce the background magnetic field on the lattice .",
    "we also tried to extrapolate our lattice results to the quantum hall effect in graphene , since the low energy dynamics of graphene is described by @xmath17 massless dirac fermions .",
    "our non - perturbative monte carlo simulations allowed to confirm the dynamical breaking of the valley symmetry in the lowest landau levels .",
    "moreover , even though we greatly underestimate the dynamical gap , we were able to reproduce the dependence of the dynamical gap on the strength of the external magnetic field .",
