    "the new atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) , although still at an early configuration , provides unprecedented resolution and sensitivity in the ( sub)mm wavelength range .",
    "recent high - fidelity alma images have revealed high contrast dust asymmetries in the outer parts of transitional disks around stars lkh@xmath1 @xcite , oph irs 48 @xcite , hd 142527 @xcite , sao 206462 and sr 21 @xcite .",
    "these findings strongly suggest that the disk dust ( and presumably gas ) distribution is non - axisymmetric and the mechanisms for the generation and sustainment of these asymmetries need explanation .",
    "two scenarios have been suggested that could lead to strong asymmetries in protoplanetary disks , both of which use the excitation of rossby wave instability ( rwi * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the rwi is a global non - axisymmetric instability which can be excited when there is a strong gradient and an inflexion point in the disk s radial potential vorticity profile .",
    "many of the previous studies of rwi , in terms of both its linear stability properties and nonlinear evolution , used an assumed and idealized structure ( such as a bump or an edge ) in the disk radial density profile @xcite .",
    "these structures , under appropriate conditions ( as detailed in the linear theory calculations in li et al .",
    "2000 ) , will form non - axisymmetric unstable modes . at the nonlinear stage ,",
    "these non - axisymmetric modes develop into vortices and they further merge to form one large vortex ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "to explain the observed features in the transition disks , one scenario envisions that there exists sharp viscosity transitions in the radial direction of disks that may arise near the edges of dead zones .",
    "sharp viscosity change , thus sharp density change at outer edge of a dead zone can excite rwi @xcite .",
    "while the evolution of rwi will try to smooth out the density variation , the continuous accretion from material at large radii in the disk provides a driving effect on the rwi .",
    "the other scenario is to explore the consequences of massive planets inside the disk @xcite , especially in connection with the inner disk holes / cavities discovered in dozens of circumstellar disks @xcite .",
    "when a planet becomes massive enough , it carves out a deep gap around its orbit . due to its significant density variations and the corresponding angular velocity adjustments",
    ", the gap edge can typically excite the rwi ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , leading to the formation of vortices . further nonlinear development of the rwi can lead to the formation of a  banana - shaped \" asymmetric density enhancement ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or one large vortex ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". one important condition for exciting rwi by a planet is that the disk viscosity needs to be sufficiently low , as it has been empirically studied by various groups ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "this scenario has been proposed to explain the alma observation of oph irs 48 @xcite , as well as the disk gap / hole @xcite .",
    "these vortices are potentially very important because they can efficiently trap dust particles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , which in turn can produce asymmetric features in disk dust emission and help promote potential planet formation .",
    "even though many previous studies have shown the generation of strong vortices in the disk , their long - term evolution , especially their survival time under different disk conditions , was left unaddressed .",
    "though the exact lifetime of these vortices and/or asymmetric features is difficult to pin down observationally , the general expectation is that they need to survive up to @xmath6 disk lifetime at tens of au distances .    in this _ letter _ , we present high - resolution , long - term two - dimensional simulations of disk - planet interactions that span @xmath7 orbits at the location of vortex and we have explored the effects of several key disk / planet parameters on the vortex lifetime , including planet mass , disk viscosity , and disk temperature . in section 2 , we present the detailed set - up of our numerical simulations .",
    "we summarize our main results in section 3 , and discuss the implication of our results in section 4 .",
    "in our study , the protoplanetary disks are assumed to be geometrically thin so that the hydrodynamical equations can be reduced to two - dimensional navier - stokes equations by considering vertically integrated quantities .",
    "we adopt an isothermal equation of state @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the vertically integrated pressure , @xmath10 is the surface density and @xmath11 is sound speed .",
    "simulations are carried out using our code ` la - compass ` ( los alamos compuational astrophysics suite ) .    the planet is taken to reside on a fixed circular orbit at radius @xmath12 with keplerian orbital frequency @xmath13 .",
    "we adopt dimensionless units in which the unit of length is @xmath12 and the unit of time is @xmath14 . in dimensionless units",
    ", the disk is modeled between @xmath15 with the planet at @xmath16 .",
    "we consider two mass ratios of the planet to the central star @xmath17 and @xmath18 , corresponding to a @xmath19 planet and a @xmath20 planet given a one solar mass central star .",
    "planet mass is ramped up to its final value in the first 10 orbits . a smoothing length @xmath21 is applied to the gravitational potential of the planet .",
    "we choose a power - law profile for both initial disk surface density and disk temperature of the form @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "the disk aspect ratio given by @xmath24 is nearly independent of @xmath25 ( hereafter we will use @xmath26 to stand for the dimensionless disk temperature ) .",
    "the initial disk mass is about @xmath19 .",
    "the dimensionless kinematic viscosity @xmath27 ( normalized by @xmath28 ) is taken to be spatially constant and ranges from @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "the shakura - sunyaev viscosity is related to @xmath27 by @xmath31 .",
    "all the simulations have a resolution of ( @xmath32 ) @xmath33 @xmath34 .",
    "the smallest hill radius @xmath35 is thus resolved by 35 cells .",
    "we employ fixed value condition at boundaries .",
    "the initial disk surface density is completely smooth without an initial gap .",
    "our simulations typically last for @xmath7 orbits ( at @xmath16 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1 ] shows the disk surface density evolution for two different planet masses . for a @xmath36 planet , a gap in the disk can be developed quickly and the edges of the gap become unstable , giving rise to vortices that quickly merge into a single vortex .",
    "this type of behavior is quite general for all massive planet cases we have studied .",
    "this vortex can last for slightly more than @xmath37 orbits ( fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1](c ) ) , then it finally disappears ( when azimuthal density variation across the vortex falls below @xmath38 ) .    for a @xmath39 planet ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](d - f ) ) , a single vortex remains robust at 5000 orbits and persists even after @xmath0 orbits in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](f ) .",
    "we see that after increasing the planet mass by a factor of 5 , the vortex lifetime becomes almost 10 times longer for the same disk conditions .",
    "we expect the vortex survival time to increase with planet mass because a more massive planet is able to clear a deeper gap .",
    "the planet creates and maintains a sharper density jump at the gap edge that drives a stronger rwi .",
    "the vortex induced by the more massive planet covers a larger azimuthal range ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](e ) ) .",
    "runs presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] all have the same planet mass @xmath40 , but different disk temperatures , @xmath41 .",
    "both cases have vortex lifetime only on the order of a few thousands of orbits . together with fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](d - f ) , @xmath42 seems to be the optimal disk temperature for the purpose of disk vortex survival time . in that case , the vortex lifetime is @xmath43 orbits .",
    "we see that disk temperature has a very interesting nonmonotonic effect on the disk vortex lifetime .",
    "either a higher or lower disk temperature results in more rapid vortex damping .    a similar effect",
    "can also be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] where we show runs with three additional disk viscosities ( @xmath44 ) . note that our code has numerical viscosity on the order of @xmath45 or less .",
    "for @xmath46 ( first row ) , the disk is barely able to form a discernible nonaxisymmetric feature even though there seems to be a clean gap .",
    "any vortex disturbance gets damped out in a very short time ( a few hundreds of orbits ) .",
    "for @xmath47 ( second row ) , the vortex evolution is very similar to that for @xmath48 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](d - f ) ) , except that vortex lifetime is almost 10 times shorter .",
    "one would expect an even longer vortex lifetime for an even smaller viscosity because damping should decrease with smaller viscosity .",
    "surprisingly , in the case of @xmath49 ( third row ) , vortex lasts for significantly shorter time than in the case of @xmath48 .",
    "therefore disk viscosity affects vortex lifetime also in a nonmonotonic way .",
    "a viscosity value @xmath48 seems to be optimal for vortex survival with @xmath50 and @xmath42 .",
    "vortex suppression at large disk viscosity has been found before @xcite .",
    "but previous studies have only considered @xmath51 and concluded the effect is monotonic .",
    "if viscosity is above some threshold ( @xmath52 in our runs ) , vortex formation can also be completely suppressed .",
    "the dependence of vortex lifetime on viscosity and temperature is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , which includes more cases than we presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] and [ fig : fig2 ]",
    ". we will give a tentative explanation for this behavior in section 4 .",
    "we now consider the evolution of vortex in more detail .",
    "the upper part of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] shows the evolution of @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the potential vorticity ( pv ) .",
    "the vortex appears as a localized region of low pv ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5](a - c ) ) because the surface density is higher in those regions . to ease comparison ,",
    "we have shifted the plots azimuthally so that the vortex is at the center in each panel ( a - c and d - f ) . due to the large velocity perturbation and very low surface density ,",
    "the pv within the gap region ( @xmath56 ) is much higher than in other regions of the disk .",
    "we set an upper cutoff on our color scale in order to make the vortex more clearly visible .",
    "the lower part of figure  [ fig : fig5 ] shows the azimuthally averaged pv , defined as @xmath57 , and disk surface density @xmath58 profiles at different times .",
    "as the surface density profile associated with the gap widens due to the continuous driving by the planet ( see the shift of in @xmath58 curves as a function of time ) , the minimum of pv profiles @xmath59 also shifts to larger @xmath25 , moving from @xmath60 at t@xmath61 to @xmath62 at t@xmath63 . correspondingly , the radial location of the vortex also moved the same amount .",
    "this is quite consistent with the prediction of rwi theory where the disk vortex is formed where potential vorticity has a local minimum .",
    "in addition , from t=100 to t=10000 , the vortex stretches azimuthally and its local strength is decreasing , as indicated by the increase of the pv at the vortex center in going from panels ( a ) to ( c ) of fig .  [",
    "fig : fig5 ] .",
    "the azimuthally averaged radial profile of pv between t=5000 and t=13500 does not show much difference for @xmath64 .",
    "in fact , the pv minimum at t=10000 is even slightly deeper than the one at t=5000 . at late time ( t@xmath65 ) , while both the disk surface density and average pv profiles have changed very small amount , the vortex is getting narrower radially and is gradually being damped .     +     +     +     +",
    "we have considered the interaction of gaseous protoplanetary disks with high mass planets that are in circular orbits with orbital frequency @xmath66 and radius @xmath67 from a central star .",
    "we have sampled the parameter space of different planet masses , different disk viscosities , and different disk temperatures and investigated how these parameters affect the lifetimes of disk vortices .",
    "we find that higher planet mass generally leads to longer vortex lifetimes , given the same disk viscosity and temperature .",
    "this result occurs because a more massive planet carves out a cleaner gap and promotes a stronger rwi at the gap edge .",
    "both disk viscosity and disk temperature have nonmonotonic effects on the vortex lifetime .",
    "we find that the optimal viscosity and dimensionless disk temperature values for vortex longevity are @xmath68 ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "higher or lower values of @xmath27 or @xmath26 would either shorten the vortex lifetime or inhibit vortex formation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) . in all our runs , we do not see the `` return '' of the vortex after its disappearance .",
    "we do not believe that the lifetimes of the vortices in our simulations are determined by viscous damping because all our runs have vortex lifetimes that are significantly shorter than the viscous timescale on the vortex scale .",
    "in addition , we find that even lower viscosity ( e.g. , @xmath71 ) actually results in shortened vortex lifetimes . instead , we speculate that the vortex is damped by shocks .",
    "several competing effects are at play which jointly determine the evolution and lifetime of the vortex . for lower viscosity or lower temperature ,",
    "on one hand , a higher mass planet is able to create a sharper gap edge and thus form stronger disk vortices .",
    "however , they also enhance spiral shocks that act to damp the vortex . for high viscosity or high temperature ,",
    "shocks produced by the planet are weaker but the planet can not create a sharp edge . consequently , in this regime the planet either does not induce vortex formation at all or it only excites a weak vortex which damps quickly . therefore ,",
    "intermediate values for disk viscosity and temperature provide the longest lived vortices that nearly balance the driving with damping of disk vortex .",
    "our findings can be compared with several recent observations .",
    "the longest vortex lifetime we find is @xmath72 orbits for @xmath40 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "the vortex is located at @xmath75 . for the other sets of parameters that we have tried",
    ", the vortex lifetime spans from 0 to a few @xmath76 orbits .",
    "to explain relatively large disk gaps with dust emission asymmetries @xcite , the planet needs to be located far from the central star . for a slightly smaller hole as seen in oph irs 48 , if we take the planet to be located at a radius of 20 au , then the vortex is located at about 40 au , and the disk inner gap has radius @xmath6 35 au .",
    "then the longest vortex lifetime we simulated implies that this vortex can live for up to @xmath77 yrs ( assuming that the central star is one solar mass ) .",
    "interestingly , these conditions are very similar to those found in the recent alma images of the disks around star oph irs 48 @xcite and stars sao 206464 , sr 21 @xcite .",
    "the rossby wave / vortex instability is due to the gas .",
    "but its interaction with the dust leaves observable signatures as seen by alma . to better connect with observations such as alma images , one needs to also model the dust dynamics and radiative transfer .",
    "it has been suggested that dust can remain concentrated after the gas vortex has decayed @xcite .",
    "we assume that gas and dust vortex lifetimes are roughly equal .",
    "our preliminary results ( not described here ) suggest they are within 30% of each other .",
    "the disk vortex needs to last for @xmath78 yrs in order to be responsible for the dust emission asymmetry in alma images of transition disks .",
    "as we have shown before , the dust asymmetry at @xmath6 40 au can survive for @xmath79 yrs , but in a very small range of our simulation parameters . for dust asymmetry at @xmath6 100 au , the required number of orbits reduces to a few @xmath80 orbits that can be realized for a broader range of disk parameters . due to the resolution of current alma configuration ,",
    "all of the dust asymmetries are found to be far from the central star . with the most extended alma configuration",
    ", future observations will be able to resolve disk feature on scales closer to the central star .",
    "on - going exoplanet surveys @xcite could also shed light on the direct detection of forming massive planets in disks with these asymmetry features .    at a large orbital radius ( @xmath81 au )",
    ", the very low disk viscosity value ( @xmath82 or @xmath83 at @xmath84 where the vortex is located ) for vortex longevity implies that this region does not evolve viscously over the disk lifetime .",
    "such a low viscosity requires some explanation . in the t tauri phase ,",
    "the observationally inferred accretion rates onto the central star suggest that @xmath85 @xcite . at that level of turbulence",
    ", we do not expect that vortices can form .",
    "the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) is a likely source of turbulence in the outer regions of a protoplanetary disk @xcite .",
    "mri typically results in an @xmath1 value @xmath86 that is again too high to permit the development of a vortex . on the other hand ,",
    "the efficiency of mri is weakened considerably in certain regions of protostellar disks due to nonideal mhd effects that result from the low levels of ionization ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "recent simulations by @xcite indicate that sufficiently low levels of @xmath1 and long vortex lifetimes can be achieved through the nonideal effects of ambipolar diffusion .",
    "the reconciliation of the low viscosity requirements of vortex generation with the high viscosity requirement of accretion is unclear , possibly involving alternate accretion mechanisms .",
    "the results presented here represent some preliminary steps in trying to understand the joint evolution of planet , disk accretion , vortices and dust asymmetries in the outer parts of the protoplanetary disk .",
    "dust - gas interaction , disk self - gravity , more sophisticated viscosity profile , 3d structure could all affect disk vortex evolution to some extent .",
