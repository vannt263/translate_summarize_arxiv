    "vortex ring bubbles in water are like usual vortex rings with circulation , but the core is filled with air , thus they are also termed `` air - core vortex rings '' .",
    "the higher velocity fluid surrounding the core of the ring is at lower pressure than the fluid farther away due to the bernoulli effect .",
    "vortex ring bubbles can be generated in various ways naturally or artificially , and they are interesting objects both from experimental and theoretical points of view .",
    "amazing examples of the natural beauty are vortex bubbles blown by dolphins for amusement . also whales sometimes blow ring bubbles that can reach several meters in diameter . in laboratory conditions ,",
    "toroidal bubbles can be created relatively easy by an air jet that is rapidly opened and closed at the bottom of a water tank , as in the early experiments by walters and davidson @xcite .",
    "the toroidal bubbles with circulation were formed as the result of gravity - induced topological transformation of an initial large spherical bubble , when a `` tongue '' of liquid penetrated the bubble from below .",
    "this appears to be a generic way of the creation of bubble rings ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "such spherical bubbles may also be produced in nature , for instance , by underwater explosions . when formed the toroidal bubbles propagate upwards with an increasing diameter .",
    "amusing examples of the generation and dynamics of vortex ring bubbles - or `` silver rings '' - may be found at the web site @xcite .",
    "the first attempts to describe the dynamics of the vortex ring bubbles analytically have been made a long time ago ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "it is clear that the most general and realistic theoretical consideration should be based on the navier - stokes equations , and thus is a very complicated nonlinear free - boundary problem in three - dimensional ( 3d ) space .",
    "however , in many cases the inviscid approximation , based on the euler equations , may provide useful results .",
    "inviscid flows belong to the class of conservative dynamical systems and thus are more easily studied by hamiltonian and lagrangian methods @xcite . with these methods , it is possible to simplify the analysis considerably and make it more compact , especially for irrotational flows , when the original 3d problem reduces to effectively a 2d problem on the free surface @xcite .",
    "the vortex ring bubble is a special example of a general class of fluid dynamical problems involving the free surface separating the fluid and air ( or generally two different fluids ) .",
    "the aim in this paper is to develop a hamiltonian formalism for these systems , and the symmetric vortex ring bubble will be treated as a particular example . in other terms , we consider the question about the principle of least action for a general toroidal bubble .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian functional is shown to possess , besides quadratic ( inertial ) terms on generalized velocities , gyroscopic terms ( of the first order on generalized velocities ) .",
    "the gyroscopic terms are proportional to the constant circulation along linked contours .",
    "this property makes the toroidal bubble similar to a vortex filament , if the circulation is large .",
    "we should emphasize that our approach , which is based on inviscid flows , can naturally not describe the topological transformation of , e.g. , a raising spherical bubble into a vortex ring bubble as briefly discussed above .",
    "having obtained a general variational formulation , we derive various approximations with reduced number of degrees of freedom .",
    "first of all , we consider the exact reduction corresponding to purely 2d flows around a cavity . in this case",
    "it is possible to express the lagrangian in terms of the so - called conformal variables @xcite . for 3d flows",
    ", we do not have an exact explicit expression for the lagrangian , but approximations are possible .",
    "such approximate dynamical systems take into account only the most relevant degrees of freedom of the original system . in this way we have obtained an approximate lagrangian for a relatively long and thin toroidal bubble . for an axially",
    "symmetric rising and spreading vortex ring bubble our variational approach provides a finite - dimensional approximate system that is a generalization of the model discussed by lundgren and mansour @xcite .",
    "the remaining of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we derive the general variational principle for the bubbles .",
    "we consider as an illustration the example of bubbles without circulation , before we derive the general lagrangian for bubbles with circulation .",
    "the two - dimensional hollow vortex is considered in sec .",
    "iii , while the three - dimensional hollow vortex with a general toroidal shape is considered in sec .",
    "iv . as a specific example",
    "we investigate the dynamics of the axisymmetric vortex ring bubble .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "v contains our summary .",
    "it is well known that a class of irrotational solutions exists in the framework of ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "such solutions describe potential flows with zero curl of the velocity field at any moment of time in the bulk of the moving fluid .",
    "if the liquid is also incompressible ( with the unit density , for simplicity ) then the investigation of non - stationary irrotational flows in a space region @xmath5 with the free surface @xmath6 can be reduced to the consideration of hamiltonian dynamics of the surface @xcite . in this formulation ,",
    "the shape of the surface @xmath6 itself and the boundary value @xmath7 of the velocity potential are the dynamical variables determining the state of the system .",
    "the velocity potential of incompressible fluid satisfies the laplace equation in the bulk of the fluid @xmath8 besides the free surface @xmath6 , in the general case the total boundary of the region @xmath5 has other pieces , which consist of infinitely far points of @xmath5 and/or some walls ( such as surfaces of submerged bodies ) . for the remaining boundary conditions for @xmath9 , we will suppose that @xmath9 vanishes at infinitely far points , and employ the no - penetration condition at a motionless wall @xmath10 ( in particular , it can be the bottom with arbitrary profile ) , if it is present : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a normal vector on the wall .",
    "the equations of motion for @xmath6 and @xmath7 take the following form : @xmath13 this set of equations describe , e.g. , the dynamics of a bubble or a void submerged into a fluid .",
    "@xmath14 is the speed of surface motion along the normal unit vector @xmath15 directed inside the bubble , @xmath16 is the normal component of the velocity field , and @xmath17 is the total time derivative of the boundary value of the potential @xmath7 on the moving surface @xcite .",
    "the ( normalized to the fluid density ) pressure @xmath18 of the gas inside the bubble ( the gas is considered as approximately massless and adiabatic ) depends on the total volume of the bubble , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is an element of the surface area .",
    "the vertical cartesian coordinate @xmath21 is measured from the horizontal plane where the pressure is zero at the equilibrium .",
    "the gravitational acceleration is @xmath22 .",
    "thus , at the horizontal surface of the fluid at the atmospheric pressure ( for instance , at the see level ) , @xmath23 m. eq.([dotsigma ] ) is simply the kinematic condition , and eq.([dotpsi ] ) follows from the bernoulli equation for non - stationary potential flows @xcite .",
    "it is possible to verify that the right - hand sides of the equations ( [ dotsigma])-([dotpsi ] ) have the form of variational derivatives @xmath24 where the hamiltonian @xmath25 is the sum of the kinetic energy of the moving fluid , the internal energy of the compressed gas , and the potential energy in the uniform gravitational field ( all the quantities are normalized to the fluid density ) , @xmath26 here the adiabatic relation between the internal energy and the pressure is used , @xmath27 the derivation of the equality @xmath28 is easy .",
    "indeed , due to the equations ( [ irrotational])-([boundary_cond ] ) one can write , @xmath29 the calculation of @xmath30 is a bit more involved .",
    "it consist of two parts .",
    "first , due to the variation @xmath31 ( in the normal direction ) of the integration domain @xmath5 without changing the potential @xmath32 inside , the following terms arise @xmath33 the second part comes from the condition that the value @xmath7 on the new @xmath34-surface must remain the same as on the old @xmath6-surface . to satisfy this requirement ,",
    "the potential @xmath32 on the old boundary should acquire the change @xmath35 .",
    "therefore the second term is @xmath36 the comparison of the sum of two these parts with the eq.([dotpsi ] ) gives the second equation from eq.([ham_form ] ) .",
    "finally , we note that surface tension can be accounted for by simply adding the term @xmath37 , which is the surface energy , to the hamiltonian ( [ ham3d ] ) . here",
    "@xmath38 designates the surface tension coefficient ( divided by the fluid density ) .",
    "it is observed that in the simplest case , when the potential @xmath32 is a single - valued function , the equations of motion ( [ ham_form ] ) follow from the variational principle @xmath39 with the lagrangian @xmath40 this expression is written in the invariant form that does not depend on the choice of the parameterization for the surface shape .",
    "practically , this choice is dictated by geometry of a given problem .",
    "for instance , the parameterization @xmath41 is commonly used to study waves on the sea surface .",
    "it is clear that due to the equality @xmath42 the functions @xmath43 and @xmath44 form a pair of canonically conjugated variables @xcite .",
    "but if we want to study oscillations of a spherical bubble , the spherical coordinates @xmath45 are more convenient . in this case",
    "the functions @xmath46 and @xmath47 can be taken as canonical variables .    as an illustrative example , we consider the case corresponding to spherically symmetric flows with @xmath48 and with a constant external pressure @xmath49 . in this case",
    "the dynamical variables depend only on @xmath50 , and we have the completely solvable conservative system for @xmath51 and @xmath52 , represented by the lagrangian : @xmath53 where @xmath54 , and @xmath55 accounts for the surface tension .",
    "the equations of motion  the euler - lagrange equations  corresponding to this lagrangian are : @xmath56 @xmath57 from here one can eliminate @xmath7 and obtain the equation of the second order for @xmath58 : @xmath59 it is easy to show that eq.([sonovol ] ) is equivalent to the simplest variant of the rayleigh - plesset equation for the radius of a spherical bubble ( see @xcite and references therein ) , using @xmath60 , @xmath61 since the lagrangian ( [ sonolum ] ) does not depend explicitly on time , the system possesses the energy integral @xmath62 therefore the solution of the eq.([sonovol ] ) is determined by @xmath63}},\\ ] ] where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are arbitrary constants . if @xmath66 ( the bubble may contain no gas ) , then the above expression describes a spherical cavity collapse for @xmath67 , as well as possible cavity formation for negative @xmath49 .",
    "more complex spherical bubble dynamics with a time - dependent @xmath68 is governed by the lagrangian ( [ sonolum ] ) as well , however , we do not have analytical solutions for that case .",
    "for instance , the dependence @xmath69 is related to the problem of single bubble sonoluminescence @xcite , where @xmath70 is the frequency of a ( relatively long ) standing ultrasound wave .      the variational formulation becomes more complicated in the case when the free surface @xmath71 , with @xmath72 and @xmath73 , is topologically equivalent to a torus , and the circulation of the velocity along linked contours takes a nontrivial value @xmath0 .",
    "now the potential @xmath32 is a multi - valued function , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the harmonic potential determined by a single - valued boundary function @xmath76 , and the velocity field created by the multi - valued harmonic function @xmath77 has zero normal component on the free surface .",
    "the important point is that the potential @xmath77 is completely determined by the shape of the toroidal bubble .",
    "the multi - valued boundary function @xmath78 associated with the potential @xmath77 increases by the value @xmath79 as the coordinate @xmath80 acquires the increase @xmath79 .",
    "the kinetic energy of the flow is represented as the sum of circulation - induced energy and the energy associated with the motion of the bubble . in the general form , we have the following expression : @xmath81 where @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 is a symmetric function completely determined by a given shape of the bubble .    in order to have correct equations of motion for @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( the equations must be equivalent to eq.([ham_form ] ) ) , it is necessary to include into the action @xmath87 a term that will give the same contribution as the following term , @xmath88\\cdot{\\bf r}_t)\\theta ~dt~d\\vartheta~d\\xi.\\ ] ] it is clear that this expression should be transformed by some integration in parts to a form where @xmath89 is not employed , but only the derivatives @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 that are single - valued functions . as a result , we obtain that the lagrangian for a hollow vortex tube can be written as follows @xmath93\\theta_{\\vartheta}\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{hollow3d } & & \\qquad+[{\\bf r}_t\\times{\\bf r}_{\\vartheta}]\\theta_{\\xi } -[{\\bf r}_{\\xi}\\times{\\bf r}_{\\vartheta}]\\theta_t\\big\\ } ~d\\vartheta ~ d\\xi.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now we may identify the function @xmath89 with the coordinate @xmath80 and thus the two last terms are equal to zero .",
    "also it is possible in general to express the potential @xmath94 as @xmath95 where the `` matrix '' @xmath96 is the inverse of the `` matrix '' @xmath97 , and thus exclude @xmath94 from the lagrangian .",
    "then we will obtain the lagrangian of the form @xmath98)~d\\vartheta ~ d\\xi -\\pi\\{\\sigma\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad+\\frac{1}{2}\\int\\!\\ ! \\int {",
    "\\cal m}_{\\sigma}(s_1,s_2 ) \\dot\\sigma(s_1)\\dot\\sigma(s_2 ) ds_1ds_2 , \\label{lagrangiansigma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the effective potential energy @xmath99 is the sum of the circulation - induced energy , the internal energy of the compressed gas inside the bubble , the gravitational energy of the bubble , and the surface energy , @xmath100    it is interesting to note that for circulation - dominated configurations ( it is important that the gradient of @xmath7 along the surface should not be equal to zero at any point of @xmath6 ) , a similarity exists between a hollow vortex tube and an ordinary toroidal vortex sheet .",
    "indeed , the dynamics of a toroidal vortex sheet in a fluid without free boundary is governed by the lagrangian ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) @xmath101\\cdot{\\bf r})~d\\nu ~ d\\xi   -{\\cal h}_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize v.sh.}}\\{{\\bf r}(\\nu,\\xi)\\},\\ ] ] where the vector function @xmath102 describes the shapes of individual vortex lines enumerated by the label @xmath103 $ ] , and @xmath104 is directed along the vortex lines on the sheet .",
    "on the other hand , when considering the hollow vortex tube with a strong circulation , we could use the function @xmath7 as a coordinate on the bubble surface , instead of the coordinate @xmath80 , and in that case the lagrangian of the hollow vortex tube would take the alternative form : @xmath105\\cdot{\\bf r})~d\\psi ~ d\\xi   -{\\cal h}\\{{\\bf r}(\\psi,\\xi)\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath106 is the total energy of the toroidal bubble .",
    "thus , the only difference between eq.([sheet3d ] ) and eq.([l_hollow_alternative ] ) is in the hamiltonians @xmath107 and @xmath108 . in the limit of a `` thin vortex tube '' the hamiltonians are almost identical , inasmuch as",
    "the main contribution is due to the logarithmically large circulation - induced kinetic energy .",
    "in the general case a free surface may consist of several separated manifolds with nontrivial topology .",
    "all of these must be included into the lagrangian in a similar manner .",
    "as application of the theory described in the previous section , let us first consider a 2d irrotational flow in the @xmath109-plane , with the circulation @xmath110 around a cavity having a finite area @xmath111 .",
    "the 2d geometry allows us to employ the theory of conformal mappings to derive exact equations of motion for such a system .",
    "conformal variables have been extensively used during recent years for analytical studies of waves on water surface , and for numerical simulations ( see , for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the system considered in this section has a set of additional properties in comparison with the usual surface waves .",
    "the presence of the circulation makes it similar to a vortex . at the same time , the hollow vortex possesses inertial properties and a potential energy in the gravitational field . for small values of the parameter @xmath112 a stationary horizontal drift of the hollow vortex is possible with the velocity @xmath113 and with the shape close to circular .",
    "this motion is stable , as will be discussed below .",
    "therefore the content of this section will serve as a basis for further simplified descriptions of 3d circulation - dominated flows .",
    "we consider an infinite two - dimensional region @xmath5 , which is topologically equivalent to the exterior of the unit circle .",
    "our purpose is to obtain an expression for the kinetic energy of the irrotational flow with the circulation @xmath114 around the cavity in the case of an arbitrary given shape of the surface and arbitrary given boundary potential @xmath7 ( with the only condition @xmath115 after one turn along the boundary . strictly speaking",
    ", this energy is infinite because of the divergency of the corresponding integral at the infinity .",
    "but this is not important for the equations of motion , inasmuch as the presence of an infinite constant term in the hamiltonian in no way influences the dynamics . therefore only the excess of the energy in comparison with some basic state is needed . as the basic state",
    ", we shall take the perfect circular shape of the boundary , with the radius @xmath116 and purely azimuthal velocity field , inversely proportional to the distance from the central point .",
    "since the velocity potential , @xmath117 , satisfies the laplace equation @xmath118 , which is conformally invariant , it is natural to re - formulate the problem in terms of the conformal mapping of the unit circle exterior into the region @xmath5 .",
    "this mapping is determined by an analytical function @xmath119 of a complex variable @xmath120 .",
    "the function @xmath121 has no singularities at @xmath122 and behaves proportionally to @xmath120 when @xmath123 .",
    "therefore the expansion of this function in powers of @xmath120 contains no positive powers higher than @xmath124 .",
    "the shape of the free surface is given parametrically by the expression @xmath125 in the potential @xmath7 we now explicitly separate the term @xmath126 , which is responsible for the circulation , @xmath127 @xmath128 the term @xmath126 corresponds to the multi - valued harmonic function @xmath129 with zero normal component of the velocity at the free surface .",
    "the single - valued function @xmath94 is related to evolution of the boundary shape .",
    "it can be understood as the potential of surface waves .",
    "the excess of energy is the sum of two parts .",
    "the first part is due to the kinetic energy of the surface waves , @xmath130 the other part arises in the circulational energy as the result of changing of the effective cavity size , and it is completely determined by the coefficient @xmath131 : @xmath132 now we have to introduce some necessary linear operators @xcite to deal with boundary values of analytical functions . in fourier - representation",
    "these operators are diagonal , @xmath133 here the operator @xmath134 is the hilbert transformation .",
    "the operator @xmath135 excludes the fourier - harmonics with positive @xmath136 , while @xmath137 excludes the harmonics with negative @xmath136 .",
    "the following equalities will be used in the further exposition , @xmath138 we have now prepared all the necessary tools , and we are able to write down the lagrangian for a 2d hollow vortex in the conformal variables : @xmath139 here @xmath140 , @xmath141 . besides the obvious terms that were already explained in the previous discussion , in the lagrangian @xmath142 there is the term proportional to the constant area of the cavity .",
    "its presence provides minimum of the circulational part of the hamiltonian on the perfect shape @xmath143 . to be punctual",
    ", we have also included the terms with the lagrangian multipliers @xmath144 and @xmath145 in order to specify explicitly the analytical properties of the function @xmath146 .",
    "the variation of the action with the lagrangian ( [ l_z_psi ] ) gives ( after some additional transformations , see appendix a ) the equations of motion for @xmath147 and @xmath148 , @xmath149 of course , these equations can also be obtained directly by simply presenting the kinematic condition and the bernoulli equation in conformal variables .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ l_z_psi ] ) is written in terms of variables that are not canonically conjugated .",
    "for general purposes , e.g. , of convenience for a nonlinear analysis , a pair of canonical variables can be found .",
    "as the canonical coordinate , we take the real function @xmath150 such that @xmath151 after substitution into the lagrangian ( [ l_z_psi ] ) , one can immediately obtain the expression for the corresponding canonical momentum @xmath152 , @xmath153 -\\hat p^{(+)}[\\psi(\\bar \\beta+i\\bar \\beta')]\\ ] ] now it is necessary to solve this equation for the potential @xmath94 in order to express the hamiltonian in terms of @xmath154 and @xmath155 . the result of the calculations is ( see appendix b ) : @xmath156 } { ( q-\\hat m q)^2+(\\hat h(q-\\hat m q))^2}.\\ ] ] thus , the hamiltonian for a 2d hollow vortex is : @xmath157~ d\\vartheta,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath158 should be taken from eq.([psi_pq ] ) , and @xmath159 is the 0-th fourier - harmonic of the function @xmath160 , @xmath161      let us consider an initial stage of evolution of a hollow vortex , starting from a nearly perfect ",
    "circular  shape ( with the mean radius @xmath116 ) , in the case of a small initial potential @xmath94 .",
    "it should be emphasized that the circular shape is not a stationary solution in the presence of gravity .",
    "therefore we are studying dynamics that can be , generally speaking , far from equilibrium .",
    "however , at least at sufficiently small times we will have @xmath162 and @xmath163 if @xmath164 . from eq.([dot_z ] ) and eq.([dot_psi ] ) we obtain the linearized ( nonhomogeneous ! ) system @xmath165 @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the kronecker @xmath168 . eliminating @xmath94",
    ", we have the set of equations @xmath169 a particular solution of this nonhomogeneous system is @xmath170 applicability of the linearized equations implies that the velocity of the vortex motion is small in comparison with the velocity of rotation @xmath171 .",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath112 should be small , or at least the time @xmath50 should be small , @xmath172 if @xmath173 , then eqs.([drift])-([no_distortions ] ) are approximately valid for arbitrary @xmath50 and describe the horizontal drift of the vortex with the mean velocity @xmath174 .",
    "the shape of the vortex in this limit remains almost circular .",
    "the general solution of the corresponding homogeneous system is the linear combination @xmath175 where @xmath176 is a discrete parameter .",
    "the dimensionless frequencies @xmath177 and the corresponding modes @xmath178 should be determined from the algebraic system @xmath179 it is clear that in the case @xmath180 the modes @xmath178 are delocalized both in @xmath80-space and in @xmath136-representation .",
    "they can be partially classified by the number @xmath181 of the last non - zero fourier - harmonics .",
    "therefore @xmath182 , and @xmath183 from here we have @xmath184 , and @xmath185    we see that regardless of the vortex size @xmath116 and the value of @xmath186 , all the frequencies are real . from the other hand , we naturally expect an instability for sufficiently large @xmath116 and/or small @xmath186 .",
    "but there is no contradiction at this point because for a large size and/or a small circulation the behavior of a coherent superposition of @xmath136-delocalized modes with real frequencies is effectively exponential at small @xmath50 .",
    "therefore the linearized equations for small deviations ( from the circular , not from an unknown stationary shape ! ) become un - valid very soon and the nonlinearity begins to play an essential role .",
    "it should be emphasized that in this subsection we have not considered an exact stationary configuration of the hollow vortex , since we do not have an analytical expression for such solution .",
    "one can expect that a stationary shape strongly deviates from circular when the parameter @xmath187 increases considerably , and finally , above some critical value @xmath188 , a stable stationary solution does not exist .",
    "however , at small @xmath187 stable stationary solutions do exist , and the stationary shape is almost circular , inasmuch as the linearized equations for small deviations remains approximately valid for arbitrary time and their solutions are stable .",
    "the questions of the determination of the critical value @xmath189 and how instability develops are left for future investigations .",
    "we proceed to a simplified consideration of a 3d thin and long closed hollow vortex tube with a smooth center - line @xmath190 and with approximately circular cross - section having a relatively small area @xmath191 , where @xmath192 is the radius of the cross - section , and @xmath193 is the total length of the center - line , @xmath194 this description should be good in most cases , since for large enough circulation ( @xmath195 ) the local quasi-2d dynamics is stable with approximately circular cross - section , and also for a straight thin 3d tube ( @xmath196 , see @xcite ) it is easy to demonstrate stability of longitudinal sausage - like perturbations .",
    "assuming slow variation of @xmath197 along the curve @xmath3 and neglecting small distortions of the shape of the circular cross - section , we can give an explicit form of all terms in eqs.([lagrangiansigma])-([pi ] ) .",

    "the interplay between the second order time - derivative ( inertial ) terms and the circulation - originated first order terms will result in oscillations that are relatively fast if @xmath0 is large .",
    "however , in the circulation - dominated regime this system has interesting solutions with these oscillations almost not excited .",
    "approximately such non - oscillating solutions are determined by the lagrangian without the inertial terms .",
    "that means we have to find a minimum of the effective potential energy @xmath200 over @xmath201 with fixed @xmath202 and then substitute the minimum - providing configuration @xmath203 into @xmath204 .",
    "the extremal configuration @xmath203 is determined by the following coupled equations , @xmath205 @xmath206 as observed from the lagrangian ( [ lagrangianra ] ) . at this point",
    "we meet a technical difficulty , since although eq.([eq_a_equilibrium ] ) has the explicit solution @xmath207}\\right),\\ ] ] unfortunately eq.([volume_condition ] ) for @xmath58 , with this expression for @xmath203 , is hard to solve exactly , except for the simplest case , @xmath208 , when @xmath203 is not depending on the volume .",
    "nevertheless , approximate methods may be used in many cases and corresponding approximate expressions for the effective hamiltonian @xmath209 of the bubble center - line can be obtained .",

    "for a hollow vortex tube without gas inside , when @xmath208 , the dynamics of the center - line is described by the effective hamiltonian @xmath211 where the function @xmath212 is defined as follows , @xmath213 + \\frac{c}{c+\\sqrt{c^2-z}}\\big\\}.\\ ] ] here @xmath214 may be considered as approximately constant , and @xmath215 .",

    "this equation is a generalization of the well known lia ( localized induction approximation ) equation @xcite .",
    "an obvious application of the lagrangian ( [ lagrangianra ] ) is for vertically rising and spreading axisymmetric vortex ring bubbles @xcite .",
    "we need only three degrees of freedom to describe this dynamics , namely the vertical coordinate @xmath220 , the radius of the ring @xmath221 , and the total volume of the bubble @xmath222 .",
    "the corresponding finite - dimensional dynamical system is determined by the following lagrangian , @xmath223 where the constant coefficients @xmath224 are used to improve the logarithmic accuracy .",
    "these coefficients arise from asymptotic expansions of elliptic integrals expressing the kinetic energy of a flow with a line source and with a vortex string on the ring center - line .    once the dependence @xmath18 is given explicitly , it is easy to write down and solve numerically the equations of motion determined by the lagrangian ( [ lagrangianzrv ] ) .",
    "we used an approximate equation of state for the gas : @xmath225 examples of the solutions @xmath220 , @xmath226 , and @xmath52 , for several values of the circulation , are presented in fig.[zrv ] .",
    "the solutions have an oscillating behavior with a drift . with such initial data , the amplitudes of oscillations for @xmath220 and @xmath226 are smaller at larger @xmath0 .",
    "however , oscillations for @xmath52 becomes stronger at highest @xmath0 , that in practice should result in intensive sound irradiation ( this naturally can not be described by the present theory of incompressible flows , but needs compressibility ) .",
    "the system ( [ lagrangianzrv ] ) has 6d phase space , but its weakly oscillating solutions approximately correspond to the 2d @xmath227-system that is obtained by neglecting the inertial terms ( quadratic on the time derivatives ) in eq.([lagrangianzrv ] ) and minimizing the expression @xmath228 over @xmath58 , @xmath229 thus , we have to solve the equation @xmath230 , @xmath231 and find from here an equilibrium value @xmath232 .",
    "the slow dynamics is approximately described by the lagrangian @xmath233 however , since eq.([equilibrium ] ) is in fact already solved for @xmath234 , it will be convenient to rewrite the lagrangian ( [ l_rz ] ) in terms of @xmath235 and @xmath58 : @xmath236 this dynamical problem is , of course , completely integrable .",
    "phase trajectories in the @xmath237-plane are the level contours of the effective hamiltonian @xmath238 the comparison between the drifting solutions of the 6d system ( [ lagrangianzrv ] ) and the corresponding solutions of the 2d system ( [ l_rz ] ) is given in fig . [ zr ] .",
    "we observe that the agreement is very good in particular for the high values of the circulation .",
    "furthermore , the overall evolution is qualitatively in agreement with the numerical results of lundgren and mansour @xcite , especially for large values of the parameter @xmath239 , when the relative variation of the volume is small ( see fig.[comparison_with_l&m ] , where all the plotted quantities have been made dimensionless as in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it should be kept in mind that applicability of the axisymmetric ( both 6d and 2d ) models requires , besides @xmath240 and @xmath241 , at least one more condition : @xmath242 this inequality makes constant - cross - area configurations be stable to longitudinal sausage - like perturbations @xcite . if a vortex ring bubble violates this criterion in the course of motion , then it will be destabilized by surface tension and the development of the instability , together with viscous effects , will result in transformation of the ring into a closed chain of smaller bubbles connected by thin vortex filaments , as it is observed experimentally ( concerning this phenomenon , lundgren and mansour @xcite refer to a private communication by d. mcsweeny ( 1990 ) ) .",
    "however , we found with realistic dependences @xmath243 that the hamiltonian evolution of the spreading ring , described above , typically moves away from the instability criterion .",
    "thus , to destroy the ring , viscous diffusion of the vorticity seems to be necessary @xcite .",
    "this will result in a slow decrease of the circulation along a contour just above the bubble surface .",
    "ultimately , this circulation becomes too small to satisfy the stability condition ( [ sausage_stability ] ) , the instability will then evolve and the ring will tend to break up .",
    "in this work we have developed a variational approach for the theoretical study of the ideal incompressible irrotational flows with a distorted toroidal bubble , in the case when the velocity potential is a multi - valued function . using this method ,",
    "we have derived exact pseudo - differential equations of motion for purely two - dimensional flows with circulation around a single cavity . also we have suggested a simplified lagrangian for a three - dimensional thin hollow vortex tube . as a simple particular case ,",
    "the axisymmetric vertical motion of a spreading vortex ring bubble with a compressed gas inside has been considered .",
    "approximate solutions of a corresponding finite - dimensional dynamical system have been obtained .",
    "these investigations were supported by intas ( grant no . 00 - 00292 ) .",
    "the work of v. r. also was supported by rfbr and by the russian state program of support of the leading scientific schools .",
    "here we extract the equations of motion ( [ dot_z ] ) and ( [ dot_psi ] ) from the expression ( [ l_z_psi ] ) .",
    "first of all , variation of the action @xmath244 by @xmath245 gives the kinematic condition in terms of the conformal variables @xmath246 now a standard procedure is to divide this equation by @xmath247 , @xmath248 and apply the operator @xmath135 which excludes fourier - harmonics with positive @xmath136 . as the result",
    ", we get eq.([dot_z ] ) @xmath249 the variation of @xmath244 by @xmath250 and subsequent exlusion of the lagrangian multiplier @xmath144 gives the equation @xmath251 the statement @xmath252 means that @xmath253 contains only harmonics with positive @xmath136 .",
    "the function @xmath254 does not contain harmonics with negative @xmath136 .",
    "therefore the equality @xmath255 is true . in our case",
    "this results in @xmath256 it is easy to check that @xmath257 now we have to take the real part of eq.([minus ] ) . using the property @xmath258",
    ", we get the equation which in fact is solved for @xmath259 , @xmath260 after simplification that uses the equality @xmath261 we finally obtain eq.([dot_psi ] ) .",
    "to solve for @xmath94 the equation @xmath153 -\\hat p^{(+)}[\\psi(\\bar \\beta+i\\bar \\beta')],\\ ] ] we perform the following steps .",
    "first , let us separate the harmonics with @xmath262 : @xmath263 = i\\alpha=2i\\hat p^{(-)}\\alpha,\\ ] ] where @xmath264 is an unknown real quantity constant on @xmath80 .",
    "now we use the same trick as in the appendix a , i.e. , we multiply the above equation by the function @xmath265 , @xmath266\\ ] ] @xmath267 and take the real part , @xmath268 @xmath269 + \\hat p^{(+)}[(p-\\gamma\\hat h q ) (      \\beta - i      \\beta')].\\ ] ] then we simplify it and use the explicit formula @xmath270 that results in the expression ( [ psi_pq ] ) ."
