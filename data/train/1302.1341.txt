    "although not yet confirmed experimentally , it is widely believed that a black hole evaporates almost like an ideal black body .",
    "this evaporation gives rise to the famous hawking radiation @xcite , where a thermal spectrum @xcite leads to a crisis of quantum physics @xcite , the so - called information loss paradox \" . in this scenario ,",
    "information is lost as a black hole evaporates , inconsistent with the unitarity of quantum mechanics , which thus presents a serious obstacle for developing theories of quantum gravity .",
    "many solutions aimed at reconciling a thermal hawking radiation spectrum with unitarity were discussed @xcite , none is capable of successfully ending the dispute . as was pointed out by wilczek and his collaborators @xcite , the thermal spectrum is due to the neglect of back reaction from emitted radiation in hawking s original treatment .",
    "an improved derivation even at a semiclassical level gives a spectrum slightly deviates from the thermal one when energy conservation is enforced during the emission process @xcite .    with the nonthermal spectrum of parikh and wilczek ,",
    "we recently show that hawking radiations can carry off all information about the collapsed matter in a black hole @xcite . after revealing the existence of information - carrying correlation among hawking radiations when the spectrum is nonthermal ,",
    "we show that entropy is conserved for hawking radiation based on standard probability theory and statistics .",
    "this prompts us to claim that the information previously considered lost is hidden inside hawking radiation , or encoded into correlations .",
    "our study thus establishes the basis for a significant way towards resolving the long - standing information loss paradox @xcite .    after discovering that the nonthermal spectrum of parikh and wilczek allows for the emissions to carry off all information of a black hole @xcite",
    ", a natural question arises as to whether hawking radiation is indeed nonthermal or not ?",
    "although the derivation of the nonthermal spectrum is based on solid theoretical background , it remains to be confirmed experimentally or in observations . in this paper , we explore experimental signatures associated with a nonthermal spectrum of hawking radiation . of great interest ,",
    "we establish smoking gun like signatures capable of distinguishing the slightly deviated nonthermal spectrum from the thermal spectrum , based on an extensive analysis on the differences between the two spectra .",
    "we thus proclaim that the information - carrying correlations among hawking radiations can be confirmed by observing the energy covariances of successive emissions .",
    "finally , we analyze the possibility of testing experimentally the paradox by counting hawking radiations .",
    "we start by briefly reviewing our resolution to the paradox @xcite .",
    "the nonthermal spectrum of parikh and wilczek @xcite for a schwarzschild black hole with mass @xmath0 is given by @xmath1   .\\ ] ] from our earlier analysis @xcite , we use @xmath2 to denote the entropy of a hawking emission , at an energy @xmath3 , conditional on the earlier emissions labeled by @xmath4 , and @xmath5 . as shown before , it is easy to compute that @xmath6 thus the total entropy for a given sequence of emissions @xmath7 that exhaust the initial black hole ( @xmath8 ) is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the celebrated bekenstein - hawking entropy for a black hole @xcite .",
    "this equality states the entropy of all emitted hawking radiation is equal to the entropy of the initial black hole , which implies no information is lost in the process of hawking radiation @xcite .",
    "with the nonthermal spectrum , correlations among hawking radiations are calibrated as follows : first we calculate the correlation between the emissions of energies @xmath11 and @xmath12 and the result is @xmath13 @xcite ; we then calculate the correlation between the emissions with energies @xmath14 and @xmath15 and the result becomes @xmath16 ; the total correlation among the three emissions @xmath11 , @xmath17 , and @xmath15 , thus becomes @xmath18 , which does not depend on the orders of the individual emissions . for the nonthermal spectrum , the total correlation in a queue of hawking radiations is summed up to @xmath19 where indices @xmath20 take all possible values labeling emissions .",
    "clearly , the analogous correlation vanishes for a thermal spectrum , or @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "this will be discussed later as it plays a crucial role in experimentally resolving the information loss paradox .",
    "given a queue of emissions , we can compute the average energies and the covariances of the emitted radiations for the two spectra : thermal or nonthermal .",
    "these are studied below after we introduce suitable units for discussing the physics of hawking radiations and their associated properties .",
    "normal treatment of hawking radiation assumes a static thermal black body emission . because the emission corresponds to a slow evaporation process for most black holes",
    ", we can include the time dependence adiabatically . using the stefan - boltzmann s law for black body thermal emission and assuming no other mass accretion or evaporation mechanisms exist",
    ", we can relate the reduction of the mass for a black hole to the energies of the emissions according to @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the schwarzschild radius , the temperature of hawking radiation is given by @xmath24 , inversely proportional to its mass , and the stefan - boltzmann constant @xmath25 .",
    "this gives the steady state time dependent mass @xmath26 of a black hole if the total mass change is due to hawking radiation alone . in the above",
    ", @xmath27 denotes the initial mass of a black hole at time @xmath28 . in subsequent emissions ,",
    "the mass thus becomes a time unit according to eq .",
    "( [ time : dependent : mass ] ) .",
    "therefore , some of the figures illustrated below are plotted against mass instead of time .    to prepare for numerically comparison of the observables associated with the two spectra , we normalize both according to @xmath29 and obtain respectively the normalized thermal spectrum @xmath30,\\ ] ] and the nonthermal spectrum @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the dawson function @xcite .",
    "we can now discuss the relevant features of the two spectra in quantitative terms .",
    "we will illustrate their differences graphically . as a result of quantum mechanics meeting with gravity ,",
    "the spectrum for hawking radiation is a function of physical quantities from very large ( @xmath33 ) to very small ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) .",

    "naively , one would conclude that it is therefore essentially impossible to experimentally distinguish the nonthermal spectrum from the thermal one , let alone to query about whether information can be carried out from a black hole by correlations hidden in the emissions .",

    "for the thermal spectrum , individual emissions are uncorrelated @xcite , thus one expects a vanishing covariance .",

    "the curve of covariance decreases because the average emission energy becomes small , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the correlation between two emissions @xmath65 and @xmath66 is proportional to the product of @xmath65 and @xmath66 , so it is reasonable that the covariance decreases at large mass limit [ @xmath82 in eq .",
    "( [ large ] ) ] .",
    "in reality , the effective radiation temperature for any astrophysical black hole is much less than the cosmic background temperature .",
    "so , the possibility of the hawking radiation observation focuses on the micro black holes which have been discussed extensively in connection with the experiments of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite . in this regards , the d - dimensional schwarzschild metric is required and the fundamental planck scale is reduced depending on the compact space of volume @xmath83 , e.g. the reduced planck scale @xmath84 with @xmath85 and @xmath86 @xcite . a recent estimate showed that the minimum black hole mass should be in the range of @xmath87 tev for @xmath88 collisions at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath89 tev at lhc @xcite . according to our analysis , the energy covariance ( [ covariance ] ) for the nonthermal spectrum is larger near the planck scale , i.e. @xmath90 @xmath91 for a black hole mass @xmath92 , which shows that if the radiation of a micro black hole were observed at lhc , its energy covariance will determine whether the emission spectrum is indeed nonthermal . of course ,",
    "the energy scale about the production and observation of micro black holes is being debated @xcite and so it remains to be seen when and whether the micro black holes could be observed on earth , especially in lhc experiment .        on the other hand , observation of hawking radiation at small man - made black holes such as those implemented or discussed with optical , acoustic , and cold - atomic systems",
    "@xcite are being discussed , and several experiments @xcite had shown the evidence of the hawking radiation from the event horizon .",
    "for instance , the observation of the analogous hawking radiation from ultrashort laser pulse filaments was recently reported by creating a traveling refractive index perturbation ( rip ) in the fused silica glass @xcite . in the experiment ,",
    "the analogous temperature of hawking radiation is @xmath93 which is equivalent to the radiation of a black hole with mass @xmath94 .",
    "such mass is large enough to make the average energy covariance is ignorable , i.e. @xmath95 .",
    "actually , the nonthermal probability in real units could be written as @xmath96   = \\exp\\left [   -8\\pi em\\frac{g}{\\hbar c^{3}}\\right ]   \\exp\\left [   8\\pi e^{2}\\frac{g}{2\\hbar c^{5}% } \\right ]   = \\gamma_{t}\\delta\\gamma$ ] where @xmath97   $ ] is the correction factor . if we want to observe the nonthermal spectrum , it is important to make @xmath98 deviate significantly from 1 .",
    "for the temperature @xmath93 , the most probable emitted energy is @xmath99 , which shows @xmath100 and so it is impossible to distinguish the nonthermal and thermal spectra , in this case unless emissions with significantly larger e can be observed .",
    "it is estimated that the observable @xmath98 requires the emissions @xmath101 with ultra - high energy , e.g. , @xmath102 indicates @xmath103 which can not happen in the discussed physical system .",
    "it is noticed that the analysis here bases on the correspondence between optical black hole and schwarzschild black hole , so it remains to be seen whether this correspondence is permitted when the backreaction is included in the radiation process and it is still interesting to see whether the correlation between emissions of hawking radiation could be observed since the unitarity requires the existence of such correlations @xcite .",
    "in summary , the important differences between the thermal and the nonthermal spectra , such as their respective average emission energies , average numbers of emissions , average emission energy fluctuations , and energy covariances , are calculated , compared , and discussed . based on our earlier",
    "result that so - called lost information of a black hole is encoded into correlations among hawking radiations , we can verify whether the spectrum of hawking radiation is nonthermal or not by counting the energy covariances of hawking radiations , which presents an avenue towards experimentally testing the paradox of black hole information loss .",
