    "many real - world networks show properties of small - world networks as their neighborhood connectivity , generally denoted by the clustering coefficient , is higher than in comparable random networks@xcite .",
    "the local clustering coefficient for an individual node @xmath2 with @xmath3 neighbors and @xmath4 edges between its neighbors is @xmath5 this formula is basically not defined if the number of neighbors @xmath3 becomes zero or one as the denominator becomes zero @xcite .",
    "these cases are usually treated as @xmath6 although some authors also set these values to one  @xcite . in the current scheme",
    ", these values would be part of the global calculation @xmath7 in addition , we tested an alternative and more widely used definition of the clustering coefficient  @xcite in which @xmath8 this might lead to biased assessments of neighborhood clustering in the sense that values that are not defined ( division by zero ) should not be included in the averaging .",
    "thus , instead of using @xmath9 as the number of evaluated nodes for the global @xmath10 , a new number @xmath11 indicating all nodes with defined local clustering should be used for a global measure @xmath12 .",
    "we show that using such an adjusted measure for the clustering coefficient has several implications for network analysis and can help to identify the contribution of leafs and isolated nodes on average clustering .    on a conceptual level ,",
    "the adjusted value @xmath12 is more intuitive as the clustering coefficient is commonly called a measure of neighborhood connectivity : if 30% of the local coefficients are zeros from cases where no neighbors exist , how can the classical definitions still give information about neighborhood ? cases of leafs and isolated nodes are more likely in sparse networks where the edge density @xmath13 , the number of existing divided by the number of possible connections ( @xmath14 for a network with @xmath9 nodes and @xmath15 directed edges or arcs ) , is low .",
    "therefore , the classical definition is a mixed measure of neighborhood clustering and sparseness ( edge density ) or  more precisely  the frequency of leafs and isolated nodes .",
    "a general problem of network measures , such as the clustering coefficient , is whether sampling or perturbations change the values of these measures .",
    "network measures are frequently used for the classification of different networks @xcite or of topological changes ( addition or deletion of nodes or edges ) within the same network .",
    "incomplete sampling  only observing a sub - network of a larger network  can lead to the wrong classification of a network as being a scale - free network @xcite .",
    "this occurred , for example , for comparing the partial and complete protein - protein interaction networks @xcite and the router and underlying communication network @xcite .",
    "in addition to sampling , false scale - free classifications can also arise due to statistical errors @xcite .",
    "whereas previous studies investigated the effect of sampling on the degree distribution , a recent study @xcite looked at the sensitivity to sampling and network perturbation for a range of measures : the clustering coefficient , as well as the hierarchical clustering coefficient , the hierarchical degree , and the divergence ratio were found to be least sensitive to perturbations of the topology .",
    "therefore , classifications using the clustering coefficient ( e.g. small - world classification @xcite ) are less affected by the sampling problem . however , as we show here , the definition of the clustering coefficient can have a considerable effect on network classification .",
    "we tested the effect of different definitions for the clustering coefficient on several real - world networks .",
    "all but one network , the german highway system , were small - world networks .",
    "the _ caenorhabditis elegans _ neuronal network consisted of individual neurons as nodes and existing synaptic connections as edges  @xcite .",
    "the metabolic networks of _ c. elegans _ , _ saccharomyces cerevisiae _ , and 41 other organisms included metabolic substrates as nodes and reactions as edges  @xcite .",
    "the protein - protein interaction network of _ s. cerevisiae _ ( yeast ) included proteins as well as interactions as discovered by the yeast two - hybrid method ( http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu , dataset from 2 dec 2007 ) .",
    "the german highway ( autobahn ) system consisted of location nodes ( that is , highway exits ) and road links between them ( autobahn - informations - system , ais , from http://www.bast.de )  @xcite .",
    "only the gross level of highways were included in the analysis , discarding smaller and local roads ( bundesstrassen and landstrassen ) .",
    "for the power grid , nodes represent generators , transformers and substations , and edges represent high - voltage transmission lines between them  @xcite . for the world - wide - web ,",
    "individual pages are the nodes and links between them the edges  @xcite .",
    "information about the size of the networks as well as a reference to the source of the datasets is included in table  [ tab.2 ] . for comparisons",
    ", we also generated random networks with the same number of nodes and edges as the original networks described above .",
    "in such erds - rnyi random networks @xcite , the probability @xmath16 that an individual connection between two nodes is established equals the edge density @xmath13 of the desired network .    [ cols=\"<,>,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      many real - world networks show features of small - world networks @xcite . in these networks ,",
    "the characteristic path length @xmath17 remains comparable with random benchmark networks whereas the average connectivity between neighbors ( clustering coefficient ) @xmath18 of a node is much higher than for random networks , that means @xmath19 but @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "one way to assess the extent of small - world features is calculating the small - worldness @xmath21 ( note that a comparison of small - worldness is only meaningful for similar edge densities as the edge density influences the possible increase in the clustering coefficient ) .",
    "how do these small - world features , in particular the clustering coefficient component of the small - worldness @xmath22 , change with the definition of the clustering coefficient ?",
    "using the measure @xmath12 would lead to higher small - worldness @xmath22the ratio between the clustering coefficient in the original and a comparable random network  if numerator @xmath18 for the original networks increases at least as much as the denominator @xmath23 for the random benchmark networks .",
    "we tested the increase of changing from definition @xmath10 to @xmath12 which can be calculated by the ratio @xmath0 ( cf .",
    "equation [ eq.4 ] ) : a larger value of @xmath0 results in a larger increase of the clustering coefficient .",
    "therefore , the small - worldness would increase as long as @xmath0 is larger for the original rather than the random benchmark network .",
    "we tested the increase for the 43 metabolic networks by generating 50 random networks for each metabolic network and using the maximum value of @xmath0 out of the random networks .",
    "for all 43 metabolic networks , @xmath0 was larger for the original network than for random benchmark networks ( fig .",
    "[ fig.4]a ) .",
    "we also generated artificial small - world networks with 100 nodes and a variable edge density ranging from the minimum ( 0.5% ) to the maximum ( 2% ) value of the metabolic networks .",
    "for each edge density , 20 small - world networks were generated and for each such small - world network , 50 comparable random networks were analyzed .",
    "in contrast to the previous results of real - world networks , random networks show a higher ratio of leafs and isolated nodes than the generated small - world networks ( fig .",
    "[ fig.4]b ) .",
    "the reason is that the small - world networks were generated starting from a lattice model followed by random rewiring of the network @xcite . despite the rewiring ,",
    "the strong neighborhood connectivity of the lattice model remains and prevents the occurrence of leafs and isolated nodes .    to remove the effect of the lattice network being the starting point of rewiring",
    ", we developed a small - world network generator with _ _ inverse rewiring _ _ : the model starts with a random network and rewires edges so that the connectedness but also the number of isolated nodes increases . for a given network with @xmath15 edges ,",
    "@xmath24 rewiring steps were performed . at each step ,",
    "an existing edge is chosen and deleted .",
    "thereafter , another existing edge is chosen and the starting node of that edge is connected with a randomly chosen node that has not before been connected to that node .",
    "each step elongates an existing chain of nodes by adding an edge , potentially leading to the formation of triangles , whereas the removed edge is either the internal or terminal part of a chain , leading towards a leaf node . for this model , in accordance with the results from the real - world metabolic networks , @xmath0 for the generated small - world network was below the value for random networks ( fig .",
    "[ fig.4]c ) .",
    "we have seen in the previous section that the small - worldness @xmath22 of a network increases , or at least stays the same , when the new measure @xmath12 is used compared to the classical measure @xmath10 .",
    "looking at both measures @xmath10 and @xmath25 could it be the case that networks that were previously classified as random would be classified as small - world with the new measure @xmath12",
    "? this would be the case if the ratio @xmath26 is lower or close to 1 for the classical measures but much higher than 1 for @xmath12 .",
    "again we tested artificial small - world networks with 100 nodes and a variable edge density using standard and inverse rewiring as described above . for each edge density ,",
    "200 networks were generated and 100 benchmark random networks were evaluated for each generated network . the definition of a change in classification from random to small - world was a clustering coefficient ratio @xmath27 for @xmath10 or @xmath25 and a ratio @xmath28 when using the measure @xmath12 . for standard rewiring ( fig .",
    "[ fig.classification]a ) , the fraction of changed cases was zero except for a small range of edge densities where the classification changed in up to 2.5% of the cases when shifting from @xmath25 to @xmath12 . for inverse rewiring ( fig .",
    "[ fig.classification]b ) , however , classification changed in around 10% of the cases ( up to 15% for some edge densities ) when shifting from @xmath25 to @xmath12 in the edge density range of 0.6%-1.5%",
    ". for shifting from @xmath10 to @xmath12 , classification only changed up to 1% of the cases ; a fluctuation which might be due to the small sample size .",
    "in addition , a shift also occurred between the classical measures @xmath10 and @xmath25 : whereas changing from @xmath10 to @xmath25 affected few cases , a shift from @xmath25 to @xmath10 affected up to 3% of the cases for standard rewiring and up to 14% for inverse rewiring . therefore , changes in classification are possible for all clustering measures ; in particular when using inverse rewiring .",
    "( x markers ) or @xmath25 ( o markers ) to @xmath12 .",
    "( a ) small - world networks generated by rewiring starting with a lattice model ( inset ) ( b ) small - world networks generated by condensation starting with a random model ( inset ) . ]",
    "we have shown that current definitions underestimate neighborhood clustering in sparse networks with many isolated or leaf nodes .",
    "in addition , the outcome of comparisons of the extent of small - world features between different networks critically depended on the applied definition of the clustering coefficient .",
    "furthermore , networks formerly classified as random can be classified as small - world when isolated or leaf nodes are excluded from the calculation of the average clustering coefficient .",
    "this can also happen when switching from @xmath25 to @xmath10 .",
    "could the clustering coefficient definitions impact the analysis of small - world networks ? there are three consequences of this study .",
    "first , small - world networks regarding previous measures @xmath10 and @xmath25 will still be detected as small - world using @xmath12 as this value will be higher than the previous values .",
    "consequently , the small - worldness @xmath22the ratio of the clustering coefficient in the original and random benchmark networks divided by the unchanged ratio of the characteristic path lengths in original and random networks  will be higher .",
    "second , networks which are currently not classified as small - world networks may be regarded as small - world due to the increase in clustering coefficient .",
    "this case will occur when the path length is comparable to that of random networks but the clustering coefficient , concerning previous definitions @xmath10 and @xmath25 , is not significantly higher than that of random networks .",
    "third , comparison of networks could lead to opposite conclusions using the new measure . in conclusion",
    ", the novel measure @xmath12 gives a clearer view of neighborhood connectivity and is more independent of the sparseness of edge density .    a problem of the proposed measure @xmath12is that the percentage @xmath0 of nodes that are excluded from analysis could be considerably high ( tab .  [ tab.2 ] ) .",
    "the percentage of excluded nodes could be as high as 14% for metabolic networks and as high as 59% for man - made networks ( power grid ) .",
    "note that the value for the protein interaction network in yeast is also high at 56% as edge density is low and isolated nodes are not part of the largest connected cluster observed here .",
    "in general , however , exclusion from the average affected less than 10% for most of the networks .",
    "in addition , using a subset of defined nodes is comparable to the procedure for calculating shortest paths or the characteristic path length where unreachable paths with otherwise infinite distance are not included in calculating the average path length",
    ".    an alternative solution would be to describe the clustering coefficient using inverse neighborhood clustering .",
    "for the shortest paths , for example , the inverse measure of efficiency @xcite where unreachable paths contribute @xmath29 to the local efficiency circumvents the need for excluding unreachable paths .",
    "similarly , the ( neighborhood ) disconnectedness @xmath1 could be defined as : @xmath30 @xmath31 here , nodes which are leafs or isolated will contribute a zero value to the average @xmath1 as one of the degrees will be zero for these nodes .",
    "@xmath1 will be high when neighbors are not connected and low ( @xmath321 ) for high connectivity between neighbors .",
    "the correlations between disconnectedness and measures of the clustering coefficient are shown in figure  [ fig.5 ] .     and measures for the clustering coefficient in 43 metabolic networks .",
    "correlations are @xmath33 between @xmath10 and @xmath1 ( a ) , @xmath34 between @xmath25 and @xmath1 ( b ) , and @xmath35 between @xmath12 and @xmath1 ( c ) . ]",
    "including the percentage @xmath0 in publications could help to understand the validity of the applied definition of the clustering coefficient regardless of whether it is the watts - strogatz definition @xmath10 , the newman - strogatz - watts definition @xmath25 , or the alternative definition @xmath12 presented here .",
    "in addition , this information is critical for the classification as small - world networks .",
    "we therefore suggest that information about the applied definition and the number of leafs and isolated nodes , the ratio @xmath0 , should be included in addition to the value of the average clustering coefficient ."
