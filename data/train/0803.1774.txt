    "understanding the effect of disorder in physical systems is of fundamental importance in various domains , such as mechanics , wave physics , solid - state physics , quantum fluid physics , or atomic physics .",

    "examples in classical systems include brownian motion @xcite , percolation @xcite , and magnetism in dirty spin systems @xcite . in quantum systems",
    "the effects of disorder can be particularly strong owing to the complicated interplay of interference , particle - particle interactions and disorder .",
    "the paradigmatic example is ( strong ) anderson localization of non - interacting particles @xcite .",
    "other interesting effects of disorder in quantum systems include weak localization and coherent back - scattering @xcite , disorder - driven quantum phase transitions and the corresponding bose glass @xcite and spin glass @xcite phases .",
    "anderson localization ( al ) signals out in two equivalent ways , either as the suppression of the transport of matterwaves in disordered media , or as an exponential decay at large distances of the envelope of the eigenstates of free - particles in a disordered potential @xcite .",
    "both properties strongly contrast with the case of periodic potentials , in which transport is free and all eigenstates extend over the full system as demonstrated by the bloch theorem @xcite .",
    "anderson localization is due to a destructive interference of particles ( waves ) which multiply scatter from the modulations of a disordered potential .",
    "it is thus expected to occur when interference plays a central role in the multiple scattering process @xcite . in three dimensions",
    ", it requires the particle wavelength to be larger than the scattering mean free path @xmath0 as pointed out by ioffe and regel @xcite .",
    "one then finds a mobility edge at momentum @xmath1 , below which al can appear . in one and two dimensions all single - particle quantum states",

    "dilute atomic bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) @xcite and degenerate fermi gases ( dfg ) @xcite are produced routinely taking advantage of the recent progress in cooling and trapping of neutral atoms @xcite .",
    "in addition , controlled potentials with no defects , for instance periodic potentials ( optical lattices ) , can be designed in a large variety of geometries @xcite . in periodic optical lattices ,",
    "transport has been widely investigated , showing lattice - induced reduction of mobility @xcite and interaction - induced self - trapping @xcite .",
    "controlled disordered potentials can also be produced optically as demonstrated in several recent experiments @xcite , for instance using speckle patterns @xcite .",
    "other techniques can be employed to produce controlled disorder such as the use of magnetic traps designed on atomic chips with rough wires @xcite , the use of localized impurity atoms @xcite , or the use of radio - frequency fields @xcite .",
    "however , the use of speckle potentials has unprecedented advantages from both practical and fundamental points of view .",
    "first , they are created using simple optical devices and their statistical properties are very well known @xcite .",
    "second , they have finite - range correlations which offers richer situations than theoretical @xmath2-correlated potentials ( _ i.e. _ uncorrelated disorder ) and the correlation functions can be designed almost at will by changing the geometry of the optical devices @xcite .",
    "finally , both the amplitude and the correlation length ( down to fractions of micrometers ) can be controlled accurately and calibrated using ultracold atoms @xcite .    within the context of ultracold gases ,",
    "important theoretical efforts have been devoted to disordered optical lattices which mimic the hubbard model @xcite . for bosons , quantum phase transitions from superfluid",
    "to bose glass and mott insulator phases have been predicted @xcite and evidence of the bose glass has been obtained experimentally @xcite . with fermi - bose mixtures ,",
    "the phase diagram is even richer and includes the formation of a fermi - glass , a quantum percolating phase and a spin glass @xcite .",
    "effects of disorder in bose gases at equilibrium without optical lattice have been addressed in connection with the behavior of the bec phase transition @xcite , the quantum states of bose gases @xcite , the localization of bogolyubov quasi - particles @xcite , the dynamics of time - of - flight imaging of disordered becs @xcite , and random - field - induced order in two - component bose gases @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of becs in disordered ( or quasi - disordered ) potentials is also attracting significant attention in a quest for observing anderson localization in non - interacting becs @xcite or in becs with repulsive interactions @xcite .",
    "recent experiments have demonstrated the strong suppression of transport in expanding becs in the presence of optical speckle potentials @xcite , but this effect is not related to anderson localization @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we theoretically and numerically analyze the expansion of an interacting one - dimensional ( 1d ) bec in a disordered potential .",
    "we focus on a regime where the inter - atomic interactions _ initially _ exceed the kinetic energy ( thomas - fermi regime ) , a situation that significantly differs from the textbook anderson localization problem but which is relevant for almost all current experiments with disordered becs @xcite .",
    "we distinguish two regimes that we name _",
    "strong disorder _ and _ weak disorder _ respectively .",
    "the case of strong disorder corresponds to the situation of the experiments of refs .",
    "@xcite where the interaction energy in the center of the bec remains large during the expansion and where the reflection coefficient from a single modulation of the disordered potential is of the order of unity . in this case",
    ", our numerical results reproduce the strong suppression of the transport of the bec as observed in the experiments of refs .",
    "we analyze the scenario of _ disorder - induced trapping _ proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite in which two regions of the bec are identified .",
    "the first region corresponds to the center , where the trapping results from a competition between the interactions and the disorder .",
    "the second region corresponds to the tails of the bec where almost free particles are multiply scattered from the modulations of the disordered potential .",
    "there , localization is rather due to the competition between the kinetic energy and the disordered potential but is ultimately due to the almost total classical reflection of the matterwave from a single barrier .",
    "these two effects are responsible for blurring anderson localization effects @xcite .",
    "weak disorder corresponds to a situation where the probability of large and wide modulations of the disordered potential is small . in this case , we show that _ anderson localization _ does occur as a result of multiple quantum scattering from the modulations of the disordered potential .",
    "let us briefly describe the scenario first proposed in ref .",
    "initially , the repulsive interactions are important as compared to the kinetic energy and to the potential energy associated to the disordered potential .",
    "then , the interactions induce the expansion of the bec and determine the momentum distribution of the bec . after a time typically equal to the inverse of the initial trapping frequency , the interactions vanish and",
    "the momentum distribution reaches a steady state .",
    "then , the bec is a superposition of non - interacting waves of momentum @xmath3 .",
    "each wave localizes with its own localization length @xmath4 . by calculating analytically the superposition of the localized waves ,",
    "we show that the bec can be exponentially localized or only show an algebraic decay depending on the correlation function of the disordered potential .",
    "in particular , due to peculiar long - range correlations , the bec localizes exponentially in speckle potentials only if @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the initial healing length of the bec and @xmath7 is the correlation length of the disorder .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ equilibrium ]",
    ", we review the properties of a bec at equilibrium in a combined harmonic plus disordered potential , in particular in the non - trivial regime where the healing length of the bec exceeds the correlation length of the disordered potential .",
    "the next two sections deal with the expansion of an interacting bec in a disordered potential .",
    "section  [ transport ] is devoted to the case of strong disorder .",
    "we reproduce and complete our previous results @xcite which demonstrate the suppression of the expansion of the bec in a speckle potential with similar parameters as in the experiments of refs .",
    "the scenario of disorder - induced trapping is analyzed and characteristic properties of the bec trapped by the disorder are calculated analytically and compared to numerical results . in particular we derive an analytic expression for the central density of the bec trapped by disorder which happens to be characteristic of the disorder - induced trapping phenomenon and we show that the ultimate suppression of the expansion of the bec is due to classical reflections from the large modulations of the disordered potential .",
    "we also compare these findings with the case of a bec expanding in a periodic potential with similar characteristics as the disordered potential .",
    "section  [ anderson ] is devoted to the case of weak disorder .",
    "we show that anderson localization can show up in an expanding , interacting bec under appropriate conditions that are clarified .",
    "we show that the localization properties of the density profile crucially depend on both the momentum distribution of the expanding bec and the correlation function of the disordered potential . in particular ,",
    "in the case of a speckle potential , we find a 1d _ effective mobility edge_. we calculate analytically the expected localization lengths and compare our findings to the results of numerical calculations .",
    "finally in section  [ conclusion ] , we summarize our findings and discuss expected impacts of our work on experiments on disordered becs .",
    "we consider a low - temperature 1d bose gas with short - range atom - atom interactions @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the 1d coupling constant .",
    "the bose gas is assumed to be subjected to ( i ) a harmonic potential of frequency @xmath10 and ( ii ) an additional inhomogeneous potential @xmath11 . in a finite system as considered in this work , assuming weak interactions , _ i.e. _ @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the average density and @xmath14 the atomic mass @xcite , the bose gas will form a bose - einstein condensate even in low - dimensional ( _ e.g. _ 1d ) geometries @xcite .",
    "hence , we can treat the bec within the mean - field approach @xcite using the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) : @xmath15 \\psi ( z , t ) , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the bec chemical potential .    in the following ,",
    "we investigate the situations where the additional potential reads @xmath17 with @xmath18 being either a disordered or a periodic function with vanishing average and unity standard deviation .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the sign of @xmath21 depends on the definition of the function @xmath18 and on the kind of potential one considers .",
    "for instance , in optical speckle potentials , the quantity @xmath22 is defined to be positive and @xmath23 for blue - detuned laser light ( case of the experiments of refs .",
    "@xcite ) while @xmath24 for red - detuned laser light ( case of the experiments of refs .",
    "@xcite ) . for a sine - periodic potential ,",
    "using @xmath24 or @xmath23 does not change the physics .",
    "see [ potentials ] for details .      here",
    ", we briefly discuss the influence of an inhomogeneous potential on the bec at equilibrium in the harmonic trap .",
    "we assume that the amplitude of the disordered potential is smaller than the chemical potential of the bec ( @xmath25 ) and that @xmath26",
    ". this question has been investigated in details in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we only outline the results .    at equilibrium , the bec wavefunction is real ( up to an irrelevant uniform phase ) and is the solution of eq .",

    "the density profile @xmath35 is an inverted parabola of length @xmath36 much larger than the healing length @xmath37 @xcite ( notice that this definition is different from the one of ref .",
    "@xcite , where we used @xmath38 ) .    in the presence of an inhomogeneous potential ( @xmath39 ) ,",
    "the parabolic shape of the density profile is perturbed . in general ,",
    "the kinetic term can not be neglected any longer . in particular , when @xmath40 , the short - range modulations of the potential @xmath41 induce short - range modulations of the bec wavefunction which contribute significantly in eq .",
    "( [ sgpe ] ) through the kinetic term . in order to take into account the effect of the inhomogeneous potential , we use a perturbative approach along the lines of ref .",

    "the solution of eq .",

    "we find @xmath49 where @xmath50 and finally , @xmath51 , \\label{dpsilda}\\ ] ] or equivalently , @xmath52 this solution justifies _ a posteriori _ the use of a perturbative approach for @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the standard deviation of the potential @xmath55 .",
    "notice that the equality @xmath56 directly follows from eq .",
    "( [ smooth ] ) .    an important consequence of the solutions  ( [ dpsilda]),([dpsildabis ] ) is that the bec wavefunction is only weakly perturbed by the inhomogeneous potential @xmath41 if @xmath53 .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ smooth ] ) that for @xmath57 , @xmath58 and the relative inhomogeneities of the bec density are @xmath59 . for @xmath40 ,",
    "the relative inhomogeneities are even smaller since all fourier components of @xmath60 are smaller than those of @xmath61 .",
    "more precisely , the effective potential @xmath60 is roughly obtained from @xmath61 by suppressing the fourier components with a wavelength smaller than the healing length .",
    "in other words , the bec density does not follow the modulations of the bare disordered potential @xmath11 but actually follows the smoother modulations of the _ smoothed disordered potential _ @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , an interacting bec _ at equilibrium _ in a disordered potential is not localized in the sense of anderson .",
    "one may wonder whether this conclusion still holds for stronger disorder or weaker interactions , where the meanfield approach can break down .",
    "this question has been addressed in ref .",
    "it turns out that for very weak interactions , the bose gas forms a so - called _ lifshits glass _ which corresponds to a fock state of various localized single - particle states .",
    "these states belong to the lifshits tail of the non - interacting spectrum and are strongly trapped .",
    "therefore , anderson localization can hardly be observed unambiguously in this case .",
    "it seems more favorable to find evidences of anderson localization in transport experiments of interacting becs , rather than studying becs at equilibrium in a disordered trap .",
    "in this section , we investigate the transport properties of a coherent bec in a disordered potential in the situation of the experiments of refs .  @xcite .",
    "we thus assume ( i ) that the chemical potential of the bec is larger than the depth of the disordered potential ( @xmath62 ) and ( ii ) that the correlation length of the disordered potential is much larger than the healing length of the bec and much smaller than the ( initial ) size of the bec , @xmath63 .",
    "we present numerical results which reproduce the suppression of the transport of the bec in a speckle potential , observed in refs .",
    "@xcite , and discuss a scenario to explain this phenomenon .",
    "in addition , we compare the observed behavior to the case of a periodic potential with similar characteristics .      in order to induce transport ,",
    "we start from a bec at equilibrium in the harmonic and disordered potentials ( see sec .",
    "[ equilibrium ] ) . at time @xmath64 , we suddenly switch off the trapping harmonic potential , keeping the disordered potential .",
    "this process is similar to the one used in refs  @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the bec is thus governed by the gpe  ( [ gpe ] ) with @xmath65 and the initial condition corresponds to the tf wavefunction discussed in sec .",
    "[ equilibrium : bec ] .",

    "the numerical calculations agree with this expression as shown in fig .",
    "[ expan ] .",
    "the situation is significantly different in the presence of disorder . in this case",
    ", the initial bec wavefunction is the usual thomas - fermi inverted parabola perturbed by the disordered potential @xcite . for @xmath74 ,",
    "the scaling form  ( [ scalingwf ] ) is still a good solution of the gpe and , according to the scaling theory @xcite the bec wavefunction expands . for larger times and small amplitudes of the disordered potential ( @xmath75 ) ,",
    "the effect of disorder on the expansion observed in the numerical calculations is small and the bec expands by about one order of magnitude for @xmath76 . for larger amplitudes of the disorder ( @xmath77 ) , the expansion of the bec stops after an initial expansion stage described above .",
    "this effect signals the localization of the bec wavefunction due to the presence of disorder .",
    "important information can be obtained from density profiles of the localized bec .",
    "for instance , density profiles corresponding to a single evolution are plotted at two different times in fig .  [ density ] .",
    "from these , it appears that the localized bec is made of two distinct parts : a static dense core and fluctuating dilute tails ( see also fig.[scaledensity ] ) . in particular , the small fluctuations of @xmath78 observed in fig .",
    "[ expan ] are due to the contribution of the tails of the bec that still evolve while the core of the wavefunction is localized ( see section  [ transport : scenario ] ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that the bec expansion stops for amplitudes of disorder significantly smaller than the typical energy per particle in the initial bec : @xmath79 .",
    "this _ suppression of transport _ is phenomenologically similar to what is expected from anderson localization @xcite . strictly speaking",
    ", anderson localization relies on the existence of localized _ single - particle eigenstates _ and on the subsequent absence of diffusion @xcite .",
    "however , we have stressed that the presence of predominant inter - atomic interactions dramatically changes the picture @xcite .",
    "on one hand , repulsive interactions are expected to reduce the localization effect @xcite . during the initial expansion of the bec",
    ", the interaction energy greatly dominates over the kinetic energy in the center of the bec so that no anderson - like localization effect is expected in this region . on the other hand , although the particles in the tails are weakly interacting due to the small density , the initial interactions determine their typical energy as the initial expansion stage converts the interaction energy into kinetic energy .",
    "we will see that , for strong disorder as considered here , the modulations of the disordered potential will ultimately stop the expansion of the dilute tails , masking any anderson - like effect ( in the case of weak disorder however , anderson localization can be obtained in this region as discussed in sec .  [ anderson ] ) . in the following ,",
    "we detail the scenario of _ disorder - induced trapping _ outlined above and first proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the bec in the disordered potential is governed by three different forms of energy : ( i ) the potential energy associated to the disordered potential , ( ii ) the interaction energy and ( iii ) the kinetic energy .",
    "it is thus useful to evaluate and compare the kinetic and interaction energies to understand the behavior of the bec in the disordered potential . to this end ,",
    "notice first that it follows from the initial expansion of the bec that the fast atoms populate the tails of the expanding bec while the slow atoms stay close to the center .",
    "in addition , notice that , except for very small amplitudes of the disordered potential and subsequent long expansion times , the density in the core of the bec remains large whereas it drops to zero in the tails ( see fig .  [ density ] ) .",
    "we thus distinguish two different regions of the bec : ( i ) the core where the density is large and the interaction energy is dominant and ( ii ) the tails where the density is small and the kinetic energy dominates .",
    "the behavior of the bec turns out to be completely different in these two regions @xcite .",
    "-   [ center ] for the sake of clarity , we define the core of the bec as half the total size of the initial condensate : @xmath80 and call @xmath81 the average bec density in the center .",
    "in particular , at time @xmath64 , due to the parabolic envelope resulting from the harmonic trap , we find @xmath82 in the absence of disorder but also in the presence of a self - averaging disordered potential . ] .    during the initial expansion stage , the average density in the core , @xmath83 , slowly decreases and the parabolic envelope disappears .",
    "since the interaction energy significantly exceeds the kinetic energy , we expect the local density @xmath84 to follow almost adiabatically the instantaneous value of @xmath85 approximately in the thomas - fermi regime so that @xmath86 in order to check this prediction , we plot in fig .",
    "[ scaledensity]a the result of the numerical integration of the gpe  ( [ gpe ] ) for the density profile in the central region of the bec during the evolution in the disordered potential at two different times , together with a plot of the analytical expression  ( [ tfbis ] ) .",
    "in particular , two properties are of special interest here .",
    "first , we observe that the time - dependent fluctuations of the density profile are significantly smaller than the modulations of the disordered potential @xmath87 .",
    "second , the density profiles are in good agreement with eq .",
    "( [ tfbis ] ) .",
    "this observation supports the scenario of an adiabatic decrease of the density in the center of the bec .",
    "the value of @xmath83 at the end of the expansion turns out to be characteristic of this scenario . in the following ,",
    "we show that @xmath83 can indeed be computed from the statistical properties of the disordered potential .     in the core ( a ) and in the tails ( b ) of the bec .",
    "both are magnifications of the plots of fig .",
    "[ density ] .",
    "the solid ( red online ) and dashed ( blue online ) lines correspond respectively to the times @xmath88 and @xmath89 of the same evolution and the dotted ( purple online ) line corresponds to eq .",
    "( [ tfbis ] ) with @xmath83 as a fitting parameter .",
    "notice the different scales in the two figures.,width=321 ]    the expansion of the core of the bec in the disordered potential stops when the condensate _ fragments _ , _ i.e. _ when the effective chemical potential in the center of the bec ( @xmath90 ) decreases down to the value of typically two large modulations of the disordered potential .",
    "at this time , the energy per particle in the core of the bec becomes too small to over - pass the potential barriers and the core of the bec gets trapped between these large modulations .",
    "this scenario allows us to determine the final value of the average density @xmath83 in the core of the bec .",
    "let us call @xmath91 the number of maxima of the disordered potential in the central part of the bec ( @xmath92 ) with an amplitude larger than a given value @xmath93 and assume that it can be computed from the statistical properties of the disordered potential .",
    "the density in the center of the bec after the trapping has occurred thus corresponds to the maximum value of @xmath83 below which two modulations of @xmath61 in average are present in the center of the bec .",
    "this is simply computed by solving for @xmath94 .",
    "although , this scheme is general , it appears clearer when applied to a case where @xmath91 can be explicitly computed .",

    "if the bec is initially in the 3d thomas - fermi regime ( @xmath236 ) , the effective de broglie wavelength of the 1d expansion can be expected to be @xmath237 to be compared to @xmath6 in the pure 1d case studied here .",
