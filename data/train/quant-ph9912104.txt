    "quantum computation is of interest because algorithms have been discovered with a significant speed - up over any classical algorithm @xcite , although these may be unique cases @xcite .",
    "it is very likely that any physical implementation of a quantum computation will require some form of active quantum error correction .",
    "quantum error correcting codes ( qecc ) have been devised @xcite and experimentally demonstrated @xcite that can protect a set of states , the codewords , against a set of errors .",
    "qecc is similar in spirit to quantum erasure experiments @xcite , but with the twist that one is not allowed to manipulate the environment .",
    "the surprising fact is that one can still disentangle the codewords from the environment , by transferring the entanglement to another set of states , the ancilla .",
    "however , implementing qecc is a formidable task .",
    "there is a high premium placed on using as few qubits ( two - level systems ) as possible , because as quantum systems grow in size , the number of transitions to be manipulated , unwanted thermal effects @xcite , and decoherence rates @xcite all increase exponentially .",
    "but , to take a specific example , the fault - tolerant error detection and repair of even a single qubit can require 15 physical qubits , 5 to store the two codewords , and 10 of which must be in known states of zero entropy @xcite .",
    "in addition , depending upon how one counts a `` logic gate '' , as many as 28 coherent manipulations of pairs of qubits are required for each repair , because `` measuring the stabilizer '' means finding the eigenvalues of operators such as @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "( 2 ) of ref .",
    "such control over a 32,768-level system is a daunting task , even for a highly coherent spectroscopy such as nmr .",
    "although the efficiency of qecc improves for larger computations , a physical scale - up factor of 22 is still required to factorize a thousand - digit number @xcite .",
    "part of the difficulty stems from the need to know which error has struck , in order to repair it .",
    "this is because different errors rotate the codeword states about separate axes in hilbert space . by containing information about which error occurred",
    ", the ancilla also provide a conditional axis about which rotation can coherently repair an error .",
    "although this seems like an air - tight argument , there is another way to approach qecc , which we will explore here .    to begin with ,",
    "note how curious it is that qecc can assign a unique status to the codewords . while a classical probability space inherently contains a privileged basis ,",
    "hilbert space does not , and this difference has some striking consequences @xcite . in order to function",
    ", qecc requires access to ancilla in a state of zero entropy @xcite , which suggests that one could view qecc as a controlled cooling of the system .",
    "it is dissipative evolution that adds classical aspects back into hilbert space .",
    "a large body of work exists that model a diverse range of relaxation phenomena in magnetic @xcite and optical resonance @xcite .",
    "they use lindblad equations of motion @xcite .",
    "an earlier approach that did use a lindblad equation @xcite implemented qecc as a limit of very fast external manipulation .",
    "in contrast , we seek an approach that is distinct from the concepts of error detection and repair .",
    "we show here that dissipation can be used to implement an `` automatic quantum error correction '' ( aqec ) , so called because error correction results exclusively from the joint evolution of a system coupled to a cold , markovian bath .",
    "no intervention is required by the programmer , and in theory , no ancilla are required , although this would be unlikely in practice .",
    "clearly , dissipation can be used to stabilize two distinct states of a quantum system that could store a classical bit of information . what is not obvious , is whether such a system could also hold a qubit , since dissipation usually destroys coherence .",
    "the key ideas are to use codewords such that errors must add energy to the system , and to set up the evolution of the system such that excitation and environmental entanglements are expelled from distinct codewords in a symmetric way .",
    "this prevents the bath from gaining information on the codewords , and thus coherence can be maintained . in the last section , we outline a system that utilizes three magnetic spin 1/2 particles , and three photons , to implement an aqec that protects against spin - flip errors .",
    "it requires only well understood interactions from magnetic resonance spectroscopy , and is intended to show that aqec has potentially real - world applications .",
    "to begin , let us review the idea of quantum error correction by way of a simple method that protects a single quantum state against environmental entanglements @xcite .",
    "the idea is similar to that of a quantum eraser experiment @xcite , but with the twist that one is not allowed to interact the environment .",
    "three two - level systems , labeled as @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , are initially in the state latexmath:[$ ( a|1_s \\rangle + b |0_s \\rangle )    current state .",
    "an interaction between @xmath1 and @xmath3 creates the new state @xmath5 . the environment is scattered into two states , @xmath6 and @xmath7 . when @xmath8 , the final state of @xmath3 depends upon the initial state of @xmath1 , so they are entangled . if @xmath9 , the phase of @xmath1 has been flipped . to repair @xmath1 , first note that the entangled state can be written as : @xmath10",
    "suppose we can externally manipulate the qubits .",
    "conditionally flip @xmath2 , if the sign of the state @xmath1 is flipped from what we expect it to be . in the language of qecc , this is `` measuring the stabilizer '' , or `` detecting the error '' .",
    "@xmath2 serves as the memory .",
    "next , flip the sign of @xmath1 , conditional on if @xmath2 detected an error .",
    "this is `` repairing the state '' .",
    "both of these actions are unitary transforms on @xmath1 and @xmath2 only ; the environment is never directly manipulated .",
    "after measuring the error , the new state is : @xmath11 and then , after the repair , @xmath12 the original state of @xmath1 has re - emerged ! the entanglement between @xmath1 and @xmath3 was transferred to be between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , without ever touching @xmath3 . in order for this scheme to work , it is crucial that @xmath2 is initially in a single pure state , or in a state of zero entropy .",
    "we expect that we can achieve this by cooling @xmath2 down to 0 @xmath13k by the third law of thermodynamics . however , there are systems such as protons in ice or frustrated spin lattices @xcite that are postulated to violate the third law .",
    "since cooling these systems still leaves them in a state of non - zero entropy , one should avoid using them as ancilla .",
    "the next step is to transform the above error correcting method into the language of a quantum system , relaxing towards equilibrium .",
    "we will make use of the operator formalism of nmr @xcite .",
    "the qubit states are @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and the projection operators are @xmath16 and @xmath17 . the raising and lowering operators are @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the hermitian pauli operators are @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the vector formed by them .",
    "the subscript also indicates which spin is acted upon , so @xmath24 acts only on spin @xmath25 .",
    "this section is similar to that of ref .",
    "@xcite , but with the difference that the measurement of the syndrome and the repair process are treated more explicitly .",
    "the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : h1 ] ) . is designed to continuously implement the example of the last section . to keep @xmath1 in the state @xmath26 , first flip @xmath2 at the rate @xmath27 , if @xmath1 departs from @xmath26 .",
    "if @xmath2 has flipped , then @xmath1 is flipped at a rate @xmath28 . to complete the process , @xmath2",
    "is cooled at a rate @xmath29 by interaction with a bath of harmonic oscillators with a broad spectral response .",
    "if the bath temperature is low in comparison to the separation of the levels of @xmath2 , then the density matrix @xmath30 evolves as @xcite , @xmath31 - c ( i_{a,\\alpha } \\rho +   \\rho i_{a,\\alpha } - 2 i_{a,- } \\ , \\rho \\ , i_{a,+ } ) \\end{array } \\label{eqn : h1}\\ ] ] we suppose the errors occur rapidly in comparison to the system dyanmics , so they are modeled as instantaneous transforms .",
    "however , slower interactions can also be corrected @xcite .",
    "dissipative evolution is usually handled in liouville space , where @xmath30 is a vector , and transformations like @xmath32 $ ] are matrix - vector multiplications @xcite .",
    "these matrices are called superoperators , since they operate on operators . eq . ( [ eqn : h1 ] ) becomes a set of linear differential equations , @xmath33 = @xmath34 .",
    "the elements of @xmath35 are then indexed by how they transform the populations and coherences of an orthonormal set that spans the hilbert space : each element of @xmath35 transforms a @xmath36 to a @xmath37 .",
    "when @xmath38 , the evolution is unitary , and @xmath35 has two kinds of eigenvalues : @xmath39 = 0 , corresponding to populations of eigenstates of @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath39 = @xmath42 , corresponding to coherences @xmath37 and @xmath43 .",
    "unfortunately , liouville space also increases the problem size : @xmath44 qubits now require an evolution superoperator with @xmath45 eigenstates .    when evolution is dissipative , @xmath35 is not a symmetric matrix .",
    "it can still be written as the outer product of its right and left eigenvectors , @xmath35 = @xmath46 , but in general the @xmath47 are not orthogonal . however , @xmath48 = @xmath49 , which allows one to formally solve the equation of motion for an operator as @xmath50 = @xmath51 . the structure of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : h1 ] ) implies that @xmath35 conserves @xmath52 , but a pure state will not necessarily remain pure .",
    "does the system of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : h1 ] ) work ?",
    "( [ fig : graph ] ) plots the real parts of the eigenvalues of @xmath35 of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : h1 ] ) for various values of @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 . the only stable states of @xmath35 will be those with @xmath53 , and there is only one such state : @xmath54 .",
    "this is how dissipative evolution can confer a privileged status on a state .",
    "a numerical integration of the system dynamics also shows this .",
    "( [ fig : graph2 ] ) plots the linear entropy , defined as @xmath55 , of @xmath56 , starting from the corrupted state @xmath57 .",
    "the rate at which the error is repaired is dominated by the eigenvalue of @xmath35 with the least negative , but nonzero , real part .",
    "curiously , a larger @xmath29 is counterproductive , as it traps the state into a cycle : @xmath58 conditions for aqec .",
    "--------------------      we now show what conditions are necessary in order that dissipative evolution can automatically protect a subspace of codewords against a given set of errors .",
    "we first suppose that the system obeys a lindblad equation of motion . in general , this is not a trivial assumption @xcite .",
    "the most speculative condition in deriving a lindblad equation is that the system and the bath initially factorize .",
    "curiously , it can be justified here on the grounds that a properly working error correction should drive the system to this state .",
    "a more troublesome condition is that if degenerate transitions are coupled to the markov bath , they must couple to orthogonal bath modes @xcite .",
    "two conditions can be stated immediately .",
    "we are assuming that evolution for a sufficient time , @xmath59 , can repair any error .",
    "thus , @xmath60 must be a repair superoperator .",
    "necessary and sufficient conditions for its existence are known from qecc @xcite . under these conditions ,",
    "the original codeword populations and coherences might be transported elsewhere in hilbert space , but they are not destroyed .",
    "the second condition is that the codewords must be immune from the influence of the bath , or that they form a decoherence free subspace with respect to the system / bath coupling @xcite .",
    "an example is instructive .",
    "suppose that we are interested in protecting a two - codeword system against spin - flip errors .",
    "the system is split into two groups of qubits , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where the @xmath2 are continuously cooled .",
    "this is not necessary for the general argument , which can be formulated entirely in terms of the eigenvalues of @xmath35 .",
    "however , it simplifies the physical interpretation .",
    "the system evolution is given by @xcite @xmath61 -   \\sum_n^{\\mbox{ancilla } } c_n \\bigg ( i_{n,\\alpha }",
    "\\rho + \\rho i_{n,\\alpha } - 2 i_{n,- } \\rho i_{n,+ } \\ , \\bigg ) \\label{eqn : lindblad}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 acts on both the @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the second term irreversibly draws population from the @xmath15 states of the ancilla spins , and places it in the @xmath14 states .",
    "choosing codewords of the form @xmath62 , for which ( 1 ) the @xmath2 are in their ground states , and ( 2 ) the codewords are eigenstates of @xmath40 , will satisfy the criteria for the decoherence - free subspace .",
    "the need for the qecc conditions can be seen as follows .",
    "suppose we choose the two-@xmath1 states @xmath63 and @xmath64 as the codewords .",
    "but then the errors @xmath65 and @xmath66 both result in the same state , @xmath67 . under the markov approximation ,",
    "the system can not know which codeword was the original codeword , and so @xmath35 can not repair these errors .",
    "but the three-@xmath1 states @xmath68 and @xmath69 will work , since the spaces spanned by all the errors acting on each codeword are now disjoint .",
    "thus , errors should transfer separate codewords into disjoint subspaces .",
    "now consider how to repair the codeword populations .",
    "the set of errors acting on a codeword , and all the further states that the corrupted codeword evolves into under @xmath35 , form a subspace , as indicated in fig .",
    "( [ fig : example ] ) . call this subspace",
    "the `` funnel '' associated with the codeword , but excluding the codeword state itself .",
    "the name is suggestive of its role in aqec .",
    "the qecc conditions already require the initially excited states to be disjoint between separate codewords .",
    "thus , if we add the third condition that @xmath35 draws all population from each funnel state into its associated codeword , and transfers no amplitude between funnels , then the codeword populations are repaired .",
    "an important difference between the usual method by which qecc is implemented , and aqec , has emerged . by placing the burden of the repair on the system / bath coupling , aqec , in theory ,",
    "requires no ancilla .",
    "consider how to repair the error @xmath70 , acting on the three-@xmath1 and two-@xmath2 codewords @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "suppose that the unnormalized states @xmath73 and @xmath74 are eigenstates of @xmath40 .",
    "the corrupted state @xmath75 now periodically becomes the state @xmath76 , where cooling of the first ancilla returns it to the codeword @xmath71 . however , we can not choose @xmath77 and @xmath78 as eigenstates of @xmath40 in order to repair the error @xmath79 , because they are not orthogonal to the first set .",
    "it seems that we must choose @xmath80 and @xmath81 to repair @xmath79 , and @xmath82 and @xmath83 to repair @xmath84 . in this strategy",
    ", we must be able to distinguish between the different errors in order to be able to repair them , and counting @xmath85 different errors requires log@xmath86 binary digits ( or ancilla qubits ) .",
    "but the third condition for aqec only requires that @xmath40 mix the states @xmath75 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 with @xmath76 , even if only partially ! because cooling irreversibly draws probably away from the excited ancilla , any degree of mixing will do . in other words ,",
    "when the 4@xmath894 block of @xmath40 corresponding to the above states is diagonalized , each eigenstate should have a non - zero projection onto the state @xmath76 , and similarly for the other codeword .",
    "we still require at least one ancilla here , because the system was split into @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and only the @xmath2 are cooled . if a bath / system coupling is found that directly cools the funnel to codeword transitions as in fig .",
    "( [ fig : example ] ) , then no ancilla are necessary .",
    "however , not all the conditions for aqec have been stated yet . the rest of these come from the seemingly bizarre notion that we can use dissipation to restore a coherence .",
    "the qecc conditions ensure that the codeword coherences are transferred , but not `` measured '' , by the environment .",
    "aqec must transfer them back .",
    "what happens to coherences during dissipative evolution is a subtle point , which is best explored by way of a comprehensive example .",
    "codewords of the form @xmath90 , with two ancilla , will serve this purpose . the environment , @xmath91 , is initially unentangled with the computer .",
    "an interaction , @xmath92 , can entangle the system so that @xcite @xmath93 after the error , the amplitude originally in each codeword is spread throughout its funnel . while the funnel states @xmath94 can be chosen as an orthogonal set for each @xmath25 , this is not true in general for the @xmath95 .",
    "as yet , there is no constraint on either how separate codewords can excite the ancilla qubits , or how the dynamics of the repair should proceed .",
    "suppose @xmath40 uses the first ancilla to repair the codewords @xmath25 = 0 and 1 , the second ancilla to repair @xmath25=2 , and both ancilla to repair @xmath25=3 .",
    "that is , @xmath40 mixes each @xmath96 with @xmath97 , and so on .",
    "let us follow an argument analogous to the `` quantum jump '' approach @xcite .",
    "the relaxation process is divided up into small time steps , @xmath98 , during which the system and bath evolve separately . at the end of each interval , a fraction of the amplitude in each excited ancilla state jumps into a de - excited state .",
    "tagging on two more qubits to represent two modes of the cold bath , at the end of each time interval , a fraction of the amplitudes make the following jumps : @xmath99 the entire process is repeated until a time @xmath59 , when the relaxation process is complete .",
    "the heart of the argument relies on the idea that , in the limit of a large number of cold bath modes interacting with the ancilla , it is very likely that different ancilla that de - excite at different times , will transfer their excitation to orthogonal modes of the bath .",
    "once excited , these modes do not further influence the evolution of the computer , _",
    "i.e. _ there is no back - reaction from the bath . in this case , after equilibrium is reached , the final wavefunction is given by : @xmath100 for a funnel that uses a single ancilla , the @xmath101 are the amplitude to start in the state @xmath102 , and transfer an excitation to the bath at @xmath103 .",
    "formally , it can be constructed from the system propagator , @xmath104 , and matrix elements of the system / bath interaction . using more than one excited ancilla results in a two - time dependence for the @xmath29 .",
    "all these functions approach zero for @xmath105 , due to the irreversible loss of amplitude from the funnel states at earlier times .",
    "the important point is that the @xmath101 , for different @xmath25 and @xmath106 , uniquely label orthogonal modes of the bath . to see the consequences of this , form @xmath30 from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : jump ] ) by tracing out the bath and environment .",
    "the populations look like this : @xmath107 with similar expressions for the other codewords . because of the earlier conditions on @xmath35 , the populations must be repaired ( there is no where else for the populations to go ) .",
    "thus , the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : popprod ] ) is one .",
    "however , from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : jump ] ) , it is easy to see that the coherence @xmath108 is zero ! using orthogonal ancilla states between @xmath25=0 and 2 resulting in these codewords becoming entangled with orthogonal bath modes .",
    "what has happened , is that the pattern of excitation in the bath can be used to determine the probability to be in each codeword . using orthogonal ancilla leaves a separate pattern of excitation behind , which means the bath has gained information about the system , and coherence is irreversibly lost @xcite .",
    "thus , another condition for aqec is that excitation should be symmetrically removed from separate funnels .",
    "the final condition comes from examining the coherence @xmath109 @xmath110 the sum is the inner product of two vectors , indexed by @xmath106 , whose elements are environmental wavefunctions .",
    "each vector individually has a unit norm , so by the swartz inequality , the sum is one if the inner product of each element is maximum .",
    "thus , the final criteria for aqec is to have @xmath111 = @xmath112 , for each pair of codewords @xmath25 and @xmath113 , and at each time @xmath103 .",
    "physically , we are again preventing the bath from gaining information about the codewords . in this case , however , the information would be transferred by the pattern of environmental entanglements with the bath , instead of the excitation .",
    "this last requirement is similar to the phase - matching requirement for frequency mixing in non - linear optical materials @xcite . consider the following contrived example .",
    "a qubit suffers an error , @xmath114 @xmath115 @xmath116 . these four states have frequencies @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 , respectively . the original coherence between @xmath14 and @xmath15 has been transferred to a new set of states .",
    "there are no ancilla to this repair ; instead , relaxation symmetrically drives @xmath121 and @xmath122 at a steady rate .",
    "therefore , we can write @xmath123 and @xmath124 . the original coherence gains a factor of @xmath125 = @xmath126 .",
    "= @xmath128 , the dynamics between the separate funnels is indistinguishable as far as the bath can discern , and a full repair results .    to summarize , the following are sufficient conditions for aqec , although they may not all be necessary . in particular , it is likely that the markov assumption could be relaxed .",
    "( * 1 * ) the system obeys a lindblad equation of motion , with an evolution superoperator @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "if cooling occurs on degenerate transitions , they must be coupled to orthogonal modes of the bath @xcite .",
    "( * 2 * ) the eigenstates of @xmath40 consist of codewords , @xmath129 , the funnel subspaces associated with each codeword , @xmath130 , and the rest .",
    "the codewords obey the conditions of qecc @xcite , and errors transform codewords only into their associated funnels . if the errors are available as joint system / environmental transforms , @xmath92 , then check whether @xmath131 = @xmath132 for all @xmath133 , and for some labeling , @xmath134 , of the funnel states .",

    "the last conditions , which are the novel aspect of this approach , are necessary in order to repair the coherences of the codewords using dissipation .",
    "alternatively , one could replace the last three conditions with criteria on the eigenvalues and left and right eigenstates of @xmath35 .",
    "this section provides a better idea of how aqec works by examining the behavior of a few numerical simulations .",

    "in fact , if @xmath169 were set to zero for the second codeword , then there would be no element in @xmath35 to transfer @xmath170 to @xmath171 .",
    "the bath gains information about the system through excitation .",
    "the coherence asymptotically approaches @xmath172 , with correct phase but low magnitude .    the second possibility is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : twoa3 ] ) . here , the ancilla are excited symmetrically , but the dynamics between the funnels is not equivalent , and coherence is again lost .",
    "the parameter set is eq .",
    "( [ eqn : examples],c ) , but @xmath169=2 for the second funnel , so the mixing was more rapid .",
    "the cooling rates were @xmath168 = 1 , and the error was @xmath70 . again , the population is repaired , but some coherence is lost .",
    "we now give a physically realizable example of an aqec system that implements shor s three - qubit , majority code against spin - flip errors @xcite .",
    "it can not repair phase - flip errors , so it is not suitable for a quantum computer .",
    "it serves to illustrate a method by which to find systems suitable for aqec .",
    "it is also encouraging that a system can be found without making recourse to exotic interactions .",
    "our strategy is to find a system that obeys multiple conservation laws that the errors violate .",
    "consider a system with an observable @xmath2 such that @xmath173=0 $ ] , and an error @xmath3 where @xmath174=e$ ] .",
    "the simultaneous eigenstates of @xmath40 and @xmath2 , @xmath175 , have the property that @xmath176 = @xmath177 .",
    "thus , choosing codewords with @xmath178 = 0 and 2 gives rise to funnel states with @xmath178 = 1 and 3 . if , in addition , there is a unitary @xmath179 such that @xmath180 , then the funnel states can be mapped onto one another , and their dynamics are equivalent .",
    "let three spin 1/2 particles be lined up along the @xmath181 axis , in a zero static magnetic field .",
    "they interact by point dipolar @xmath182 and exchange @xmath183 terms @xcite .",
    "dipolar interactions decrease with distance as @xmath184 , so for equally spaced spins , @xmath185=@xmath186=@xmath187=@xmath188 , where @xmath188 can be as large as 0.1 @xmath189 @xcite .    assuming the dipolar interactions dominate , the level diagram of the spins is given in fig .",
    "( [ fig : spins],a ) . the spins attempt to mutually align , resulting in ground states of @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "these are the codewords .",
    "a spin - flip error , @xmath24 , is equivalent to rotating a spin by @xmath190 about the @xmath191 axis .",
    "since this requires work against the dipolar field , dissipation can repair these errors .",
    "the funnels come from the conservation of the spin angular momentum about the @xmath181 axis , @xmath192 , which has eigenvalues denoted as @xmath193 .",
    "an error changes @xmath194 .",
    "the codewords have @xmath195 .",
    "the funnel surrounding @xmath68 ( levels a - c of fig .",
    "( [ fig : spins],a ) ) has @xmath196 , and the funnel surrounding @xmath69 has @xmath197 ( levels d - f ) .",
    "spontaneous emission of a photon with an @xmath191 polarized @xmath179 field will symmetrically de - excite the degenerate funnels .",
    "thus , we could use photons as the ancilla for this system .",
    "there are several advantages to this approach .",
    "first , it is difficult to selectively cool a single spin , but it is easy to cool an electromagnetic resonator .",
    "second , the validity of the markov approximation for a damped resonator mode is better understood @xcite .",
    "a @xmath198-polarized @xmath179 field will anti - symmetrically de - excite the funnels , so an error @xmath199 will be `` repaired '' to the phase - flip error @xmath200 .",
    "this phase - flip error can not be repaired , because it requires no work to rotate a spin about the @xmath181 axis for this system .",
    "there are two last difficulties to overcome .",
    "the dashed lines of fig .",
    "( [ fig : spins],a ) show the dipole - allowed transitions for the @xmath196 states .",
    "their strengths are proportional to matrix elements of the operator @xmath201 .",
    "point dipolar interactions alone are not sufficient for aqec , because @xmath202 is always zero , no matter how the spins are positioned along the @xmath181 axis .",
    "this unwanted symmetry is broken by setting @xmath203 = @xmath204 = 0 and @xmath205 .",
    "actually , any @xmath206 will work . using the above parameters",
    "gives rise to the spectrum of fig .",
    "( [ fig : spins],b ) .",
    "the second difficulty is that , besides spontaneous emission of @xmath198-polarized @xmath179-field photons , there are also transitions between the funnels .",
    "we wish to cool only the starred transitions ( at @xmath207 , @xmath208 , and @xmath209 ) , but not the un - starred ones ( at @xmath210 , @xmath211 and @xmath212 ) .",
    "this can be achieved by placing the spins at the center of a resonator whose modes are only resonant with the starred transitions .",
    "consider a rectangular , conducting cavity of linear dimensions @xmath178 , @xmath213 , and @xmath27 .",
    "resonances are indexed as transverse electric ( te@xmath214 , where @xmath215 , @xmath216 ) and transverse magnetic ( tm@xmath214 , where @xmath217 , @xmath218 ) modes @xcite , with frequencies @xmath219 = @xmath220 in units of @xmath189 if the cavity lengths are in cm .",
    "each mode produces either a linearly polarized electric or magnetic field , or no field , at the center .",
    "one can invert the above to find that a resonator with dimensions @xmath178=2.32/@xmath188 , @xmath213=0.87/@xmath188 , and @xmath27=4.28/@xmath188 , has te@xmath221 , te@xmath222 , and te@xmath223 modes resonant with the starred transitions .",
    "each mode has an @xmath191 polarized @xmath179 field at the spins .",
    "another 29 modes exist with @xmath224 . of those that produce @xmath179 fields at the spins , the nearest to a funnel - funnel transition is te@xmath225 , which is offset by 0.018@xmath188 from the c - e transition .",
    "a resonator q @xmath226 is required to suppress emission of this transition . for @xmath227 @xmath189 , microwave resonators can achieve this goal .",
    "this larger @xmath188 is also desirable because the cold bath must satisfy @xmath228 0.1 k , a not outrageous requirement .",
    "aqec borrows the same structure for storing information as in qecc , but implements the error correction in a different way . in nmr terminology ,",
    "the qubit of the above system is hidden in the triple quantum coherence of the spins .",
    "the novel aspect is that dissipation can be used to directly repair not only the codeword populations , but also the coherences . the criteria for this",
    "is simply summed up by demanding that excitation , and environmental entanglements , be expelled from the codewords in a symmetric manner .",
    "especially interesting is the possibility that an aqec qubit exists that can protect against both spin- and phase - flip errors .",
    "exchange interactions may prove more useful in this regard .",
    "being isotropic interactions , they resist the rotation of a spin about any axis .",
    "one difficulty with using only exchange interactions , is that dipole - allowed transitions vanish , so a symmetric de - excitation of all the funnels by photons becomes problematic .",
    "another open question is how aqec behaves when it is scaled up to large numbers of codewords .",
    "it is , however , helpful to contemplate an error correction scheme that requires no additional burden to the programmer .",
    "conditions are given by which the dissipative evolution of a system , coupled to a cold markovian bath , can be used to implement automatic quantum error correction .",
    "the new condition , necessary to repair codeword coherences , requires a symmetric de - excitation of separate codewords , and an equivalent dynamics between the different codeword / funnel subspaces .",
    "they resemble the conditions of phase - matching in nonlinear optics . a test case , that of shor s majority - code against spin - flip errors @xcite , is proposed .",
    "it utilizes well known dipolar and exchange interactions between spins , and dipole - allowed transitions with the modes of a resonator .",
