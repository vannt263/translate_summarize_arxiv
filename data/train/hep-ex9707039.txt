    "the first two years after the commissionning of the first @xmath4 collider hera in may 1992 were devoted in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) to the observation of the new processes which would become the main subject of study nowadays in desy .",
    "the observation of the rise of the @xmath2 proton structure function at low @xmath1  @xcite was the first of this type of measurement which is still progressing in terms of precision and possibilities of qcd test , @xmath0 and gluon density determination .",
    "the rich phenomenology at low @xmath1 could also be studied in the measurement of hadronic final state properties .",
    "the clear observation of diffractive events  @xcite paved the way to a detailed and not yet finished study of one of the most obscure problem of the strong interaction .",
    "the observation of high @xmath3 charged and neutral current  @xcite with very low statistics at that time , but in a perfect experimental environment allowed a glimpse to what will be the future of the hera collider .",
    "the subsequent years ( 1994,1995,1996 ) are covered in this report .",
    "they allowed the first precise measurements of the phenomena mentioned above , besides many others . in 1995 ,",
    "the h1 collaboration upgraded the backward detectors of the experiment , introducing in particular a more precise drift chamber ( bdc ) to measure the polar angle of the scattered electron , and a new spacal calorimeter with better hadronic containment , better granularity and better angular acceptance .",
    "the results obtained have fullfilled the expectations and a new step in precision could thus be reached for the low @xmath3 physics .         in conclusion",
    "the accumulation of these events at @xmath5 gev is genuine , but is not confirmed by the distribution of the zeus events at high @xmath3 and high @xmath6 . however zeus has also an excess of a few events in nc at very high @xmath3 .",
    "the systematic effects being well under control , both on the expectation side as on the detection side , more data are needed to understand if the observed excess at high @xmath3 is due to a statistical fluctuations or to signs of new physics .      a selected sample of h1 results presented at this workshop in the different areas of dis has been summarized .",
    "the increase of the luminosity will bear significant improvements in all these fields , showing the potential of the hera collider .",
    "most awaited is an answer on the high @xmath3 puzzle which might reveal signs of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "i would like to thank the organizers for an exciting and enjoyable workshop .",
    "thanks also to the 15 h1 speakers of the parallel sessions who provided me with much of the material shown here and to john dainton for a careful reading of the manuscript .",
    "many thanks to ursula bassler for her great help both in the preparation of the talk and in the completion of the written report .",
