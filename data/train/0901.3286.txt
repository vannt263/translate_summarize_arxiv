    "the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) has been largely used to provide a simple single site description of disordered alloys@xcite .",
    "another application of cpa procedures is the description of _ pure _ metals in presence of electron - electron correlations@xcite . in this formulation",
    ", one describes the correlated electron by a spin and energy dependent effective self - energy which incorporates the effects of correlation .",
    "this self - energy is self - consistently determined by imposing the vanishing of the scattering @xmath0 matrix associated to a given site which exhibits the full coulomb interaction .    in our model , the metal has two non - degenerate bands , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the first is a hubbard - like narrow band with in - site interaction @xmath3 , hybridized with the second one , @xmath2 , a broader band .",
    "the hamiltonian we adopt to describe pure metals is then @xmath4 where @xmath5 ; @xmath6 denotes spin .",
    "@xmath7 denotes the tunneling amplitudes between neighboring sites @xmath8 and @xmath9 , in each band ; @xmath10 is the center of the @xmath1-band .",
    "we follow roth s approach@xcite to describe the electron - electron correlation through an effective hamiltonian @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the self - energy associated with electron - electron interaction .",
    "we recall that the main spirit of the method consists in replacing a tranlationally invariant problem , as defined by ( [ h ] ) , by the alloy problem , defined by ( [ heff ] ) , where only the origin incorporates the coulomb interaction .",
    "the effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) still includes the difficulty of dealing with the coulomb intra - atomic term at the origin and we have to resort to some approximation .    in the green s function method@xcite ,",
    "the equation of motion of a given green s function generates higher order functions and we thus need a decoupling procedure . after some algebra@xcite we end up with the following green s functions : @xmath13 the green s function of the bare @xmath2 band , @xmath14 and the green s function of the renormalized @xmath2 band @xmath15 in these equations @xmath16 is the recursion relation of the renormalized @xmath1 band ; @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the bare bands .",
    "the vanishing of the t - matrix gives a self - consistent equation for the self - energy :    @xmath19    with @xmath20 this is equivalent to an alloy analogy approximation , where the broadening correction@xcite has been neglected .",
    "our self - consistent numerical results can describe a transition metal of the iron group ( then @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) or some f electron compounds ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) .    in fig([dos ] ) we present the density of states ( dos ) of the @xmath1-band for @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in same units , the bare @xmath1 band width is @xmath27 .",
    "the fermi level is at @xmath28 .",
    "this gives @xmath29 and @xmath30 and thus a ferromagnetic moment of @xmath31 is developed .",
    "the dos here obtained exhibits a bimodal structure caracterizing a hubbard strongly correlated regime .    in fig ( [ sigma ] ) the real part of @xmath12 is displayed for @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
