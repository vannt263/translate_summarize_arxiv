    "the interplay of electronic degrees of freedom with phonons or photons is relevant for a wide range of condensed matter systems .",
    "this includes systems where electrons interact with local vibrational degrees of freedom such as , for example , in molecules , or with delocalized lattice vibrations ( phonons ) such as , for example , in solids .",
    "the interaction of electrons and photons can be understood on similar grounds , identifying the electric field strength with the displacement of a vibrational or a phonon degree of freedom .",
    "thus , for example , matter - light interaction is often described by hamiltonians @xcite that are very similar to the ones used to describe electron - phonon interactions @xcite .",
    "the coupling results in mutual excitation and deexcitation processes .",
    "for example , phonons or photons can be excited via a deexcitation of the electronic subsystem .",
    "such an excitation decays typically fast , if the phonon or photon field is delocalized and the excitation energy is transferred efficiently away from the place of interaction .",
    "this is the situation when the electrons are under the influence of an external electric field or interact with phonons in a solid .",
    "the situation is different for nanostructures where the bosonic degrees of freedom are localized .",
    "the simplest realization of such a scenario is a molecule .",
    "photons can be localized inside a cavity @xcite . in both cases",
    ", the bosonic degrees of freedom can be driven into highly excited nonequilibrium states @xcite .",
    "it is challenging to understand these states , because they can not be described via a bose - einstein distribution function .",
    "nevertheless , these states determine the functionality and efficiency of many devices that may be used for nanoelectronic applications @xcite , quantum information processing @xcite , solar energy conversion @xcite or the control of chemical processes @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we investigate the nonequilibrium properties of a vibrational mode in a single - molecule junction .",
    "thereby , the molecule is contacted by two electrodes which represent macroscopic electron reservoirs .",
    "this can be achieved , for example , using a scanning tunneling microscope , electromigration or break - junction techniques @xcite .",
    "a bias voltage can be applied such that electrons tunnel through the molecule . due to the small size and mass of a molecule ,",
    "the tunneling electrons are likely to interact with the molecules vibrational modes , leading to inelastic tunneling processes where vibrational motion is excited and deexcited @xcite .",
    "this behavior has been observed in a number of experiments @xcite .",
    "the observation , however , is often indirect , because a direct measurement of the level of vibrational excitation , for example via raman spectroscopy @xcite , is very involved .",
    "the level of vibrational excitation may be more easily and more reliably accessed in quantum dot systems which are coupled to a microwave cavity ( circuit quantum electrodynamics ) @xcite . here , the quantum dots take on a similar role as the molecule in a molecular junction , while the number of photons inside the cavity correspond to the excitation number of a local vibrational mode .",
    "infact , measurements of the photon number have been reported recently @xcite .",
    "identifying again the electric field strength with the displacement coordinate of a vibrational mode , the theoretical description of these systems is very similar @xcite ( cf .",
    "[ hagt ] ) .",
    "in contrast to single - molecule junctions , however , where the contact geometry and other ( _ e.g. _  internal ) coupling parameters are hard to control , experiments on quantum dot systems can be carried out with greater precision and more handles of control , including , for example , the wide tunability of the electron - photon coupling strength @xcite . given these remarkable analogies , vibrational dynamics in a molecular junction can be used to understand quantum impurity circuit - qed systems and vice versa .    in this contribution",
    ", we focus on the counterintuitive prediction that , in a molecular junction at sufficiently high bias voltages , the level of vibrational excitation increases with decreasing electronic - vibrational coupling strengths .",
    "this phenomenon has been reported in a number of theoretical studies @xcite and explained via the suppression of electron - hole pair creation processes @xcite .",
    "the latter study was based on born - markov theory and pointed out the connection between the limits of an infinite bias voltage and a vanishing electronic - vibrational coupling strength .",
    "thereby , the hybridization of the junctions levels with the electrodes , thermal broadening and the effect of a heat bath has been discarded .",
    "we take a big step forward and extend these considerations by broadening effects , verifying that the slope of the vibrational excitation level as function of electronic - vibrational coupling can be negative over a wide range of parameters . due to",
    "broadening , the level of vibrational excitation stays finite in the limit of a vanishing coupling and does not increase indefinitely as the coupling constant vanishes .",
    "moreover , we show that the non - analytic behavior is an artifact of the model itself . for non - zero coupling strengths and/or in presence of a heat bath ( analogous to the leakage of photons in the cavity context )",
    "we find an analytic behavior .",
    "while the electronic - vibrational coupling is hard to control in molecular junctions , quantum dot realizations may give a direct access to this phenomenon , that is a decrease of the level of vibrational excitation or photon number with an increasing coupling strength .",

    "in addition , we considered transition rates corresponding to higher - order processes corresponding to , for example , off - resonant pair creation or inelastic cotunneling .",

    ", a treatment of these processes in terms of virtual tunneling processes , where broadening effects are explicitly excluded , leads to the same result as the one that is obtained from born - markov theory .",
    "at this point , we emphasize that a similar behavior of the level of vibrational excitation is found in the presence of a second higher - lying electronic state @xcite .",
    "this is of particular interest in the present context , as the photon number in cqed systems has been measured in double quantum dot setups , using the spin - torque effect @xcite .",
    "future directions of research should therefore include the description of the level of vibrational excitation / photon number in the weak coupling limit of these more complex systems , including the effect of electron - electron interactions .",
