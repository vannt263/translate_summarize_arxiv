    "light flavor quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) with up , down and strange quarks is a fascinating theory , that features only a few parameters . variations of these parameters have been explored in great detail in the last decade .",
    "we mention in particular varying the quark masses to make contact with lattice simulations , but also variants of the theory with more light quark flavors or different numbers of colors have been studied .",
    "these studies mostly focused on the fate and exploration of the dynamical and explicit symmetry breaking that light flavor qcd exhibits a much less explored territory relates to the @xmath0-term of qcd , @xmath3 where @xmath4 are color indices and @xmath5 is the gluon field strength tensor .",
    "while the upper limit on the neutron electric dipole moment poses a stringent limit on the value on @xmath0 , where the latest determination gives @xmath6  @xcite , it has been argued that based on the string theory landscape , @xmath0 might take natural values and that it is difficult to achieve a tiny value for it , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite . independently of that , it is interesting to explore qcd at larger values of @xmath0 .",
    "qcd at @xmath7 was already investigated in refs .",
    "also , the pion and the nucleon mass were calculated at fixed topology in ref .",
    "@xcite to explore the connection between lattice qcd and physical observables .",
    "further , ubaldi   @xcite studied the effects that a non - zero strong - cp - violating parameter would have on the deuteron and di - proton binding energies and on the triple - alpha process using a somewhat simplified nuclear modeling .",
    "even so the relevant energy scales in these systems exhibit some fine - tuning , no dramatic effect of varying @xmath0 was found .",
    "we also note a recent study on the relation between confinement and the @xmath0-vacuum , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-dependence of the pion mass has been given at leading order ( lo ) in chiral perturbation theory ( chpt )  @xcite .",
    "here , we want to derive the pion mass in the @xmath0-vacuum up to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) as well as the corresponding pion - pion ( @xmath8 ) elastic scattering amplitude .",
    "furthermore , we will calculate the @xmath0-dependence of the lightest resonances in qcd , the scalar meson @xmath1 and the vector meson @xmath2 .",
    "these are not only interesting by themselves , but also are important components in precision modelings of the nuclear forces , as used e.g. in the work on extracting limits on variations of the higgs vacuum expectation value from the element abundances in big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite ( for related works using different frameworks , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in the following ,",
    "we assume that the @xmath9 and the @xmath10 are generated from a resummation of pion - pion interactions evaluated at nlo in chpt in the @xmath0-vacuum .",
    "having calculated the @xmath0-dependent pion - pion scattering amplitude , it is straightforward to implement it into a unitarization ( resummation ) scheme that can generate the light resonances and thus gives their @xmath0-dependent properties . to be specific ,",
    "we make use of the so - called ( modified ) inverse amplitude method , which is one , but not the only available , unitarization scheme that allows to perform this task .",
    "our work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : l ] we discuss the chiral effective lagrangian in the @xmath0-vacuum , with particular emphasis on the two - flavor formulation and also including strong isospin breaking .",

    "[ sec : pipi ] .",
    "armed with that , we then come to the central section  [ sec : rhosigma ] , where the mass and the width of the @xmath9 and the @xmath10 are calculated as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "we end with a short summary and outlook in sec .",
    "[ sec : sum ] .",
    "the appendix contains some discussion of the vacuum alignment at nlo .",
    "at the lowest order , @xmath11 , the su(@xmath12 ) chiral lagrangian in the @xmath0 vacuum is  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the pion decay constant in the chiral limit and @xmath15 . here , @xmath16 is the real and diagonal quark mass matrix , and the low - energy constant ( lec ) @xmath17 , with @xmath18 the absolute value of the flavor - averaged quark condensate in the chiral limit .",
    "the field @xmath19 su(@xmath12 ) collects the goldstone bosons of the theory .",
    "however , only for @xmath20 the vacuum expectation value of it , which is the solution of the equations of motion for the zero - momentum mode , is trivial , i.e. @xmath21 . in the general case ,",
    "the vacuum is shifted from the unit matrix , and the vacuum alignment can be determined by minimizing the potential energy .",
    "therefore , it is useful to separate the ground state @xmath22 from the quantum fluctuation @xmath23 containing the goldstone boson fields as @xmath24 . thus , the ground state of the theory is given by minimizing the potential energy @xmath25 because @xmath16 is diagonal , @xmath22 can be taken as diagonal as well without loss of generality .",
    "the special unitary matrix @xmath22 can be parametrized as @xmath26 this leads to @xmath27 with @xmath28 the quark mass of flavor @xmath29 .    for @xmath30 , because the theory is periodic in @xmath0 with a period @xmath31 , the lagrangian is invariant under cp and p transformations as they change @xmath0 to @xmath32 .",
    "however , it is well - known that at @xmath30 , there is a spontaneous cp breaking , called dashen s phenomenon , because the cp conserving stationary point of the action is in fact a maximum and there are two degenerate cp violating vacua which are obtained by minimizing the potential energy @xcite .      in the rest of the paper",
    ", we will consider the two - flavor case and use the following parametrization @xmath33 we see that the angle @xmath34 and the neutral pion field always appear in a linear combination @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , finding the stationary solution for @xmath22 by minimizing the potential energy with respect to @xmath34 is equivalent to removing the tree - level tadpole for the neutral pion  @xcite .",
    "the minimization of @xmath36 gives  @xcite @xmath37 where the average light quark mass @xmath38 and the parameter @xmath39 , that quantifies strong isospin breaking , are introduced .",
    "actually , at @xmath30 and @xmath40 the eqs .   do not depend on @xmath34 at all .",
    "this leads to a paradoxical situation of continuous vacuum degeneracy discussed in @xcite and resolved in @xcite taking into account terms of the nlo chiral lagrangian .    in the present work we also consider the nlo chiral lagrangian  @xcite . in the su(2)@xmath41su(2 )",
