    "several applications are proposed and already realized , such as single - photon transistors , two - photon gateways , parametric downconversion as well as the generation and detection of individual microwave photons @xcite .",
    "furthermore , several quantum gate proposals rely on a natural quantum interface between flying qubits ( photons ) and stationary qubits ( e.g. atoms ) . here , the photons allow for secure quantum communication over long distances , whereas atoms can be used for the manipulation and storage of quantum information @xcite . applying cqed techniques",

    "so , besides technological progress to increase the quality factor of the cavities , a promising alternative is to identify strategies to control and exploit potentially advantageous properties of the environment coupling , which go beyond the conventional effects of the environment like dissipation and undesired information loss .",
    "a possible mechanism to stabilize qubits and desired quantum states is quantum feedback based on the repeated action of a sensor - controller - actuator loop .",
    "in such a case , a quantum system is driven to a target state via the external control @xcite , such that continuous measurements allow to stabilize the target state , e.g. by a modification of the pumping strength .",
    "in addition to these extrinsic control set - ups , experiments start to explore a variety of intrinsic , delayed feedback control schemes , e.g. , by using an external mirror in front of a nanocavity @xcite .",
    "intrinsic quantum feedback is not based on a continuous measurement process , but controls the quantum state by shaping the environment appropriately @xcite . here",

    "the excellent agreement found between these two solutions confirms the validity of our calculations . for longer times , more terms from the series expansion ( [ eq : cg_analytical ] ) should be included , which is a straightforward procedure .",
    "as a next step , we derive the long time behaviour using the residuum method .",
    "the long time dynamics of the coupled system is directly related to the singularities in the contour integral of the laplace transformed function @xcite . to demonstrate this explicitly , we need to find the singularities of the photon - assisted ground state amplitude : @xmath61 the singularities are found by setting the denominator to zero . we assume a pure oscillation behavior in the long time limit , i.e. , where @xmath44 is purely imaginary .",
    "we set @xmath62 and get : @xmath63 from which immediately follows @xmath64     and @xmath33 .",
    "after several @xmath39 , the analytical long time solution and the numerics coincide . ]",
    "we now need to find a delay time @xmath39 in a way , that for @xmath65 , this equation is valid .",
    "as it turns out , the corresponding singularity condition can be matched for the following two cases : @xmath66 in order to satisfy these conditions we observe that we can freely choose the delay time with respect to the coupling strength by adjusting the length @xmath4 between cavity and mirror accordingly . for instance , if we choose @xmath67 and at the same time tune the resonance frequency such that @xmath68 , where @xmath69 are integer numbers , then the conditions @xmath70 and @xmath71 are satisfied .",

    "[ fig : long_time_solution ] , the numerical solution and the analytical long time solution is plotted for @xmath34 ( i.e. when @xmath76 ) up to several @xmath39 .",
    "the agreement is excellent with the long time solution accurately recovering the amplitude and the oscillation frequency of the numerical solution .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath77 , we recover the jaynes - cummings solution as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cavity_damped_jcm ] ) with @xmath77 .",
    "in contrast to eq .",
    "( [ eq : cavity_damped_jcm ] ) , we see , however , that the cavity loss does not modify the frequency of vacuum rabi oscillations , which is now equal to the coupling strength @xmath2 , and only damps the corresponding amplitude . in this context , we discover a maximum amplitude for the feedback effect via this proposed mechanism .",
    "it is seen that eq .",
    "yields the following amplitude of the quantum feedback induced rabi oscillations for @xmath34 : @xmath78 .",
    "therefore with @xmath79 , the maximum amplitude is approximately @xmath80 in correspondence with fig .",
    "[ fig : long_time_solution ] , which is 15% of the maximum photon amplitude in the first time interval @xmath35 $ ] . with these results at hand",
    "we can now also answer the questions raised above : ( i ) the effect of stabilized rabi oscillations in the long time limit depends strongly on the chosen time delay @xmath39 , which has to be chosen such to satisfy one of the conditions ( [ cond_i ] ) , ( [ cond_ii ] ) that lead to asymptotically undamped rabi oscillations .",
    "furthermore , the factor @xmath81 $ ] plays a crucial role to decide whether quantum feedback leads to a stabilized rabi oscillation or to a damped feedback situation .",
    "however , the effect depends only quantitatively ( rather than qualitatively ) on the cavity loss @xmath82 and coupling strength @xmath2 , besides the obvious restriction that both of them are unequal to zero .",
    "( ii ) for a given ratio between the coupling strength and the cavity loss , @xmath83 , there is a maximum amplitude which is given for the above case by @xmath84 .      to give an intuitive explanation for this effect of recovered rabi oscillations in the weak coupling limit",
    ", we visualize the resulting cavity dynamics in the framework of the photon - path representation @xcite . for this purpose",
    "we rewrite the system of equations of motion , in the laplace domain as : @xmath85   \\begin{pmatrix } c_e(s ) \\\\",
    "c_g(s )   \\end{pmatrix},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the scattering matrix : @xmath86 assuming that there is an inverse to that matrix and using the neumann expansion , we get for @xmath87 : @xmath88 \\begin{pmatrix } c_e(0 ) \\\\",
    "c_g(0 ) \\end{pmatrix}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , the dynamics is written in a very complicated manner but in a way that the photon path ( represented by scattering processes due to @xmath89 ) becomes visible . with this expansion",
    ", one can represent the dynamics as a series of single scattering events by multiple application of the matrix , which swap the excitation from @xmath90 to @xmath91 and includes the cavity loss and the gain from the feedback .",
    "this becomes especially apparent , when writing down the single terms of the laplace transform and then transforming them back into the time domain .",
    "in particular for the ground state probability such an expansion reads ( terms up to @xmath92 are kept only ) : @xmath93 from the structure of this expansion follows that undamped rabi oscillations can be viewed as a result of an interference between incoming and outgoing photonic paths provided that @xmath34 . in other words ,",
    "the strong coupling feature is produced by a destructive interference effect of the photon paths at the point within the waveguide , where the tunneling event between cavity and waveguide takes place .",
    "this expansion explains furthermore that it takes a minimum time for this effect to unfold , since at least two dissipatively interacting waves need to be in the waveguide .      to complete the picture",
    ", we investigate the proposed feedback mechanism via a quasi - continuum in the strong coupling limit .     after only one roundtrip @xmath39 , when the feedback from the waveguide is present ( orange curve ) .",
    "initially , the excitation is stored in the tls ( @xmath42 ) . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : strong_coupling ] , the dynamics with and without feedback is plotted for a a coupling strength @xmath94 .",
    "clearly , rabi oscillations are visible with and without feedback .",
    "if no feedback is present , however , the amplitude of the rabi oscillations are damped fast without changing the frequency . with a feedback and a chosen delay time of @xmath95 ,",
    "on the other hand , the amplitude loss is stopped at very early times already : already after one roundtrip the amplitude stays constant for all times , if no other loss mechanism inside or between mirror and cavity is present .",
    "we explain the acceleration of the stabilization feature by the fact , that for the strong coupling regime the in- and outgoing photons already interfere efficiently after one roundtrip .",
    "in contrast , in the weak coupling limit the in- and out tunneling does not overlap for the first three roundtrips and as a consequence inteference takes place at longer times only . if we choose a larger roundtrip time @xmath39 ,",
    "also in the strong coupling regime , a higher number of roundtrips @xmath96 is necessary to reach the point of stabilized rabi oscillations .",
    "we have discussed an approach to stabilize single - emitter cqed via a quantum feedback mechanism induced by an external mirror .",
    "our analytical solution shows that depending on the chosen parameters an intrinsic limit of the feedback effects exists . for a system initially in the weak coupling regime ( before the feedback modifies the system dynamics ) we demonstrate that the quantum feedback can at most recover approximately 15% of the maximum cavity occupancy in the first time interval .",
    "our analytic calculations demonstrate furthermore that the quantum feedback induced rabi oscillations are indeed coherent and follow a typical differential delay equation with an appropriate inhomogeneity to drive the system into the strong coupling regime .",
    "our results extend the set of exact analytical solutions in the field of coherent atom cqed and form a starting point to establish a framework for a theoretical description of coherent quantum feedback .",
