    "<S> we study the transverse expansion in central pb+pb collisions at the cern sps . </S>",
    "<S> strong collective motion of hadrons can be created . </S>",
    "<S> this flow is mainly due to meson baryon rescattering . </S>",
    "<S> it allows to study the angular distribution of intermediate mass meson baryon interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * , # 3 ( # 4 )    an important question raised in the recent year is : is there collective transverse expansion and flow at midrapidity in relativistic heavy ion collisions ? </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon has long been predicted@xcite as a result of strong stopping and compression wave or shock wave formation with subsequent hydrodynamical sideward momentum transfer . </S>",
    "<S> flow of baryons and mesons has been experimentally observed at the lbl / bevalac and at gsi / sis in the 1  agev regime@xcite , as well as at the bnl / ags@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the question now has been raised whether the strong blue shift of the inclusive hadron spectra for high multiplicity events observed last year at the sps pb(160  agev)+pb system@xcite can be theoretically explained by a microscopic calculation . here </S>",
    "<S> we report that the observed strong increase of @xmath0 with @xmath1 can be due to the large fraction of secondary meson baryon collisions .    </S>",
    "<S> a heavy ion collision can be divided into three phases : incoming nucleons interact with each other , they produce secondary particles and gain transverse momentum . in the course of the rescattering stage , the system may reach thermal ( or even chemical ) equilibrium , while collective transverse expansion develops . </S>",
    "<S> finally the system dilutes , strong interactions cease - the system freezes out .    </S>",
    "<S> the studies presented in this letter are performed within the urqmd model @xcite , a microscopic hadronic transport approach based on the covariant propagation of mesonic and baryonic degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> it allows for rescattering and the formation and decay of resonances and strings .    </S>",
    "<S> let us briefly discuss how meson baryon reactions are modeled within urqmd . in the low energy region , i.e. @xmath2  gev , the inelastic cross section is dominated by s - channel resonance formation . </S>",
    "<S> it is calculated from detailed balance according to the sum of the possible final state baryon resonances ( e.g. @xmath3 ) : @xmath4 which depends on the total decay width @xmath5 , the partial decay width @xmath6 , the spins of the particles @xmath7 and on the c.m . </S>",

    "<S> this resonance decays _ isotropically _ in its local restframe into ( one or more ) mesons and a baryon .    in the ultra high energy limit </S>",
    "<S> t - channel processes dominate the total cross section , which can be calculated from regge theory@xcite : _ total = xs^+ys^- . here </S>",
    "<S> the first term describes the pomeron exchange , while the second one is due to @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 meson exchange , while @xmath13 denotes the squared center of mass energy . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters are fixed by experimental data when available ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ,  ) . </S>",
    "<S> for completely unknown cross sections we employ additional rescaling factors from the additive quark model@xcite under the assumption of a 40% reduced s - quark cross section ( compared to u , d ) : @xmath16\\quad , \\\\ </S>",

    "<S> , the fragmentation of the strings leads to a strongly forward - backward peaked distribution of secondaries .    </S>",
    "<S> heavy ion collisions at the ags and , even more so , at the sps exhibit an intricate scenario : here , the typical mb collision energies are in the range of 2 - 10  gev , thus can not be assigned to one of the above discussed regimes . the necessity to bridge consistently from one picture of meson baryon interactions to </S>",
    "<S> the other becomes apparent if we look at the following reactions where a low momentum pion hits a nucleon @xmath20    to investigate the influence of the modelling of meson baryon scattering on the collective transverse flow , the urqmd model was used in two different modes :    1 .   a complete downward extrapolation of the high energy longitudinal color flux picture to @xmath21  gev ( refered to as forward - backward peaked ( f - b ) variant ) . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> an upward extrapolation of the resonance behaviour , i.e. an isotropic angular distribution of all outgoing particles in meson baryon reactions ( indicated as ( iso ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> these changes affect only mb collisions above the resonance region ( @xmath22  gev ) ; all other channels , i.e. meson meson and baryon baryon reactions , remain unchanged .    </S>",
    "<S> let us start by comparing both scenarios to recent preliminary experimental data . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ hminus ] the mean transverse momentum of negatively charged particles as a function of rapidity in pb+pb , @xmath23  fm at 160 agev is depicted . </S>",
    "<S> open circles are na49 data @xcite , open squares are calculated with the resonance extrapolation ( iso ) and full squares denote the high energy prescription ( f - b ) . </S>",
    "<S> overall good agreement for both ansatzes with the data on the 10% level is found from projectile to target rapidity .    </S>",
    "<S> let us turn now to the transverse momentum spectra of baryons . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ proton ] shows the  apparent temperature  of protons ,  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath24  , in pb(160agev)+pb for different rapidities in comparison with preliminary na49 data ( open circles ) @xcite . the inverse slope  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath24  is obtained from a fit to the transverse mass @xmath25 spectrum using ^-m_t / t . in both scenarios , </S>",
    "<S> the  temperature  of the protons increases towards midrapidity . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum  </S>",
    "<S> temperatures  are 270 mev ( f - b , full squares ) and 395 mev ( iso , open squares ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the isotropic meson baryon scattering prescription predicts a temperature at @xmath26 exceeding the preliminary data by 30% .    to gain further insight into the creation of transverse flow , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ mass ] discusses the mean transverse momenta of particles for different mass bins at @xmath27 in central pb+pb collisions at the sps . </S>",
    "<S> circles show the p(160 agev)+p events , open squares indicate the ( f - b ) pb+pb events and the full black squares show the mb-(iso)tropic model . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we fit the resulting mass spectra with a simplified 2 parameter fireball plus flow model . </S>",
    "<S> the full black line is the mean transverse momentum @xmath28 for different masses @xmath29 calculated from a thermal distribution with temperature @xmath30  mev ( to fit the @xmath31 ) without any additional flow ( @xmath32 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line shows the @xmath28 from an expanding thermal source ( @xmath33  mev ) with an additional transverse flow velocity of @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> this yields in the saddle point approximation a rough value for the  _ apparent _ temperature  @xmath24@xcite : tt_0+m_t^2 . </S>",
    "<S> the mean @xmath35 of all hadrons , from proton - proton reactions as well as from the high energy nucleus - nucleus ( f - b ) scenario show no significant difference to a non - expanding thermal source </S>",
    "<S> . however , additional _ baryon _ flow is visible due to further baryon baryon collisions . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a bump in the mean @xmath35 around @xmath36  gev . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the isotropic ( mb ) model produces a hadronic source which expands more strongly in the transverse direction . </S>",
    "<S> a significant transverse collective flow velocity of @xmath37 is observed in this calculation . due to its very small cross section in nuclear matter </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath38-meson aquires less transverse flow compared to other hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> note that the error bars are only statistical . </S>",
    "<S> these are given only for the ( f - b ) pb+pb reaction , in the ( mb iso ) and p+p case they are about the same .    </S>",
    "<S> the observed apparent  temperatures  </S>",
    "<S> ( inverse slopes ) at midrapidity ( @xmath27 ) depend strongly on the particle mass @xmath29 as depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ slope ] . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated proton - proton collisions ( crosses ) show about the same freeze - out  temperature  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath39 for all particles from @xmath40 to @xmath41  gev . in pb(160 agev)+pb , </S>",
    "<S> the  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath24-values increase -in contrast to the data- only weakly above the p+p values , if the forward backward scenario ( mb ) is applied . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , isotropic angular distributions for intermediate energy meson - baryon collisions ( in line with the resonance picture ) yield a linearly increasing apparent  temperature  with the particle mass for pb(160 agev)+pb , in agreement with the preliminary na49 data .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that strong transverse flow can occur in massive reactions at the sps . however , the hadron mass dependence of the apparent temperature is sensitive to the detailed modelling of the meson - baryon rescattering process above the resonance region ( @xmath42  gev ) and below the high energy domain . </S>",
    "<S> two distinct pictures of meson baryon scattering with @xmath43  gev have been confronted : the high energy limit of longitudinal fragmenting color strings was extrapolated downward in energy , versus the concept of resonance formation of meson baryon scattering with isotropic decay . </S>",
    "<S> both models describe the rapidity dependence of the transverse momentum of produced particles equally well , while the isotropic scattering prescription predict the apparent proton temperatures at midrapidity about 30% larger than preliminary data </S>",
    "<S> . however , strong increase of the transverse slope does _ only _ build up in the high energy resonance model. </S>"
