    "fueled primarily by the promise @xcite of optical imaging beyond the diffraction limit , metamaterials , @xcite artificial composites with the unit cell size well below the optical wavelength , now for more than a decade remain one of the primary foci of modern research .",
    "however , while metamaterial devices , from the originally promised superlens @xcite based on the negative index media , to its younger challenger the hyperlens @xcite that uses hyperbolic metamaterials , have been demonstrated in experiment @xcite in broad range of frequencies and even extended to other wave phenomena such as e.g. ultrasound imaging , @xcite they have yet to find their way to broad acceptance in real - world applications .",
    "the inherent curvature of the metamaterial device that is necessary for optical magnification ( either in the general formfactor of the device @xcite or in its unit cell topology @xcite ) , leading to the requirement on precise positioning of the object at subwavelength scale , remains a major practical obstacle to a wider acceptance of metamaterials - based imaging systems .",
    "more important , however , is the result of substantial loss in metamaterial structures , that is generally a direct and inevitable consequence of using metallic ( or other negative permittivity ) components that remain necessary for either the negative - index metamaterials or hyperbolic media . faced with an order of magnitude intensity loss @xcite as the cost of producing a magnified optical image of a subwavelength pattern",
    ", one must either accept a prohibitive cost in the signal - to - noise ratio , or substantially increase the intensity of the field that illuminates the target .",
    "the latter option however does not fit well with the constraints of biomedical imaging , where high optical fields may severely damage biological tissue .",
    "while directly related to the fundamental restrictions on optical metamaterials @xcite via the kramers - kronig relations , this problem however allows a natural and straightforward solution : the metamaterial component of a super - resolution imaging setup must be located `` in front '' , rather that `` after '' , the object  so that it s probed by the already attenuated field , thus avoiding damage .",
    "this is precisely the case in the structured illumination @xcite approach to optical imaging , where a grid pattern , usually generated through the interference of incident light , is superimposed on the specimen.@xcite the imaging resolution is then determined by the periodicity of the illuminating field , and for illumination from free space this limit reduces to one quarter of the wavelength , @xmath0 .",
    "however , as we demonstrate in the present paper , hyperbolic metamaterials that are free from the conventional diffraction limit and can support optical patterns with the periodicity that is orders of magnitude below the free - space wavelength @xmath1 , can dramatically improve the imaging resolution in structured illumination .",
    "the resulting _ hyper - structured illumination _ approach to super - resolution imaging is the main objective of this work .",
    "in a conventional transparent medium with the refractive index @xmath2 , the frequency @xmath3 generally limits the magnitude of the wavenumber @xmath4 to the value of @xmath5 . however , the situation is dramatically different in the world of hyperbolic metamaterials , @xcite where the opposite signs of the dielectric permittivity components in two orthogonal directions ( @xmath6  see the inset in fig .",
    "1(a ) ) lead to a hyperbolic dispersion of @xmath7-polarized propagating waves @xmath8 with the wave numbers unlimited by the frequency . for @xmath9 , the hyperbolic iso - frequency surface of ( [ eq : hyperbola ] ) asymptotically",
    "approaches a cone , with @xmath10    as the direction of the group velocity @xmath11 corresponding to a given wavevector @xmath12 coincides with the normal to the iso - frequency surface , at large wavenumbers in a uniaxial hyperbolic medium the angle between the group velocity and the material symmetry axis @xmath13 ( see the inset to fig .",
    "1(a ) ) approaches the value of @xmath14 . as a result , for a point source placed at the edge of such medium , the emission intensity diagram forms a conical pattern ( see fig . 1 ( b)-(d ) , calculated for a practical realization of hyperbolic media using silver - glass layered metamaterial ) , with the `` thickness '' of the expanding conical `` sheet '' of electromagnetic radiation well below the free - space wavelength .",
    "this phenomenon is now well - established , and has recently been successfully used for subwavelength optical lithography .",
    "@xcite    as strong material dispersion is inherent to hyperbolic materials , a change in the frequency @xmath3 will result in a substantial variation of the emission cone angle @xmath15 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "1(a ) for three different wavelengths . while generally considered detrimental to metamaterial applications ( since this would immediately push the system away from whatever resonant condition is was designed for ) , it is precisely this property that is essential to the concept of the hyper - structured illumination .",
    "while a single source ( or an opening ) at the bottom of the hyperbolic `` substrate '' only illuminates a small part of the object plane at its `` top '' , a change in the electromagnetic frequency would allow to sweep the entire object plane ( see fig . 1 ( b ) - ( d ) ) .",
    "as a result , a complete subwavelength image can be obtained in a single hyper - spectral measurement .",
    "this behavior is further illustrated in fig .",
    "2 , which shows the object formed by four silicon nanowires on top of the silver - glass metamaterial ( @xmath16 silver and @xmath17 glass layers , each @xmath18 nm thick  see fig .",
    "2 ( a ) ) , illuminated at the wavelengths of @xmath19 nm ( panel ( b ) ) and @xmath20 nm ( panel ( c ) ) . note the subwavelength localization of the electromagnentic field near the object , and a dramatic difference in the intensity distribution for different wavelengths that allows to clearly `` resolve '' distinct elements of the target despite their close spacing .",
    "a finite size of the unit cell of the metamaterfial , @xmath21 , introduces an upper limit on the ( bloch ) wavenumber @xmath22 , equal to @xmath23 , as well as quantitative corrections to the dispersion @xmath24 and to the geometry of the iso - frequency surface , leading to its deviations from the hyperbolic shape .",
    "however , the overall topology of the iso - frequency surface , together with its dependence on the wavelength , are generally preserved ",
    "1 ( a ) . as a result",
    ", one will still observe the general profile of the conical illumination pattern , as well as its evolution with the wavelength that are consistent with the predictions of the effective medium theory , as clearly seen in fig . 1 ( b)-(d )",
    "however , as the size of the unit cell limits the maximum wavenumber that can be supported by the propagating waves in the hyperbolic metamaterial , it defines the ultimate resolution limit @xmath25 of the hyper - structured illumination : @xmath26 with the scale of the unit cell in high - quality hyperbolic metamaterials that have already been demonstrated , on the order of a few nanometers , @xcite eqn .",
    "( [ eq : hsi_limit ] ) allows for optical imaging of deeply subwavelength objects , to the point of resolving large individual molecules .",
    "while a hyperbolic metamaterial supports propagating electromagnetic waves with the characteristic length scale up to its unit cell size , these waves will evanescently decay outsize this medium . as a result",

    "a 3d object structured at a deeply subwavelength scale , the proposed imaging system based on hyper - structures illumination , will resolve the motti projection @xcite @xmath30 of its tree - dimensional permittivity distribution @xmath31 : @xmath32 note that the integral transformation in eqn .",
