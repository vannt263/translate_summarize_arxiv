    "causality often appears as an axiom in the formulation of physical theories , typically as the assumption that effects can not precede their causes .",
    "however , what is often left unclear is which general principles should be used to _ define _ causal relations and relata .",
    "the recent technical developments of causal modelling provide a consistent mathematical formalism that relates causal influence to the possibility of signalling @xcite .",
    "this approach provides an explanation for why causation is not ` merely correlation ' and has shed light on contentious issues across a variety of scientific fields @xcite .",
    "causal models rest on essentially two concepts : the existence of autonomous _ mechanisms _ , responsible for producing the observed correlations , and the possibility of _ interventions _ , which modify part of the mechanism according to some factor external to the model .",
    "it is the latter notion that differentiates causal relations from simple correlations .",
    "together , mechanisms and interventions define what is known as the _ causal markov condition _ , a constraint imposed on the structure of a causal model .",
    "causal models have proved tremendously useful for understanding causal relations across a broad range of disciplines .",
    "they provide a powerful mathematical toolbox for efficiently extracting causal information from observed data , figs .",
    "[ blackbox ] , [ watermill ] .",
    "they enable scientists to predict , manipulate and explain .",
    "the application of such models to physics represents a promising direction for a deeper and unified understanding of causality @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , one can not straightforwardly apply these methods to quantum systems .",
    "causal models presume the existence of objective properties that can be observed and manipulated locally .",
    "such assumptions are incompatible with quantum mechanics , as most prominently demonstrated by bell s theorem @xcite .",
    "of course , one _ can _ apply the classical methodology , but only at the expense of introducing hidden , fine tuned @xcite mechanisms , such as action at a distance @xcite or retrocausality @xcite . although seemingly conservative , such approaches violate the very pillars of causal reasoning : they posit the existence of mechanisms that can not be discovered and variables that can not be controlled .",
    "an alternative approach is to reformulate causal models from the ground up , in a way that makes direct use of the quantum formalism .",
    "indeed , quantum theory can be seen as a theory of interventions @xcite and , from the perspective of quantum information , causal relations are identified with _ signalling _ , in direct agreement with the intuitions underlying classical models . additionally , quantum circuits @xcite are often interpreted as being representative of causal structure .",
    "this suggests that quantum causal models should be rather natural within quantum theory .",
    "however , despite much work in this direction @xcite , a general framework for quantum causal models has not been found . as identified in ref .",
    "@xcite , a key missing step is the formulation of a quantum version of the causal markov condition .",
    "in classical models , this condition enables one to use observational and interventionist inference to deduce causal structure from data .",
    "arguably , a formalism for quantum causal modelling would require a similar condition .          here",
    "a complete framework for quantum causal modelling is presented .",
    "the framework rests on quantum definitions of mechanisms and spatio - temporally localised interventions .",
    "a quantum version of the causal markov condition is defined , allowing for the possibility of _ causal discovery _ , namely , the identification of causal structure from empirical data .",
    "classical causal models are recovered as a limiting case of the formalism .",
    "furthermore , the formalism allows for natural quantum extensions of classical concepts , such as faithfulness and the distinction between direct and indirect causes .    in the present framework ,",
    "causal relations are identified with the possibility of signalling , that is , with the possibility of modifying the statistics of an event through intervention on a different event .",
    "the role of interventions was not clearly identified in previous works , which rather attempted to generalise various aspects of ` causally neutral ' bayesian networks  @xcite . without a definition of intervention",
    ", it is not clear in what sense such generalisations should be thought of as _",
    "causal_.    although some notion of interventions is present in ref .",
    "@xcite , in that formalism not all correlations have a causal explanation , as a new form of ` contemporaneous ' correlation is postulated to account for entanglement . by contrast , in the causal models introduced here all correlations arise from direct , indirect , or common causes .",
    "classical causal models use probability distributions and it is natural to ask whether quantum causal models can be defined by simply replacing such distributions with density matrices .",
    "however , a classical joint probability distribution can describe common - cause as well as direct - cause relations , whilst a joint density matrix can not describe direct - cause relations between quantum events @xcite .",
    "attempts have been made to generalise density matrices in order to solve this problem  @xcite . in such attempts",
    "each quantum event is associated with a single hilbert space , and it has been shown that such approaches face serious problems @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the present work identifies a quantum event with a local operation and thus is associated with a _",
    "pair _ of hilbert spaces , describing respectively the input and the output of the operation .",
    "this follows the quantum networks  @xcite and process matrix  @xcite formalisms . ultimately , `",
    "splitting ' the hilbert space of an event is what allows for a unified representation of arbitrary causal structures .",
    "this fact was also recognised in ref .",
    "@xcite , which presented a special case of the general framework introduced here .",
    "other recent works have focussed on the correlations between classical variables produced in experiments involving quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "these works adopt a _",
    "device independent _ perspective , where the observed data contain no information about the functioning of or the physical theory describing the instruments used .",
    "such frameworks can not distinguish direct from indirect causes , or more generally formulate a quantum version of the causal markov condition .",
    "such limitations are overcome here by adopting a device dependent quantum formalism , where the description of events contains all relevant information regarding the physical devices that produced them .",

    "an introduction to the framework presented here is also considered from a broader philosophical perspective in ref .",
    "the brief review of classical causal models presented here is based on the monograph by pearl  @xcite .",

    "the variables are depicted as circles and the mechanisms depicted via connecting arrows .",

    "noise variables are typically not drawn explicitly and the arrows are interpreted as generic stochastic processes , defined by a conditional probability @xmath6 . ]",
    "unknown noise affecting the mechanism can be modelled as an additional variable @xmath5 with an associated probability distribution @xmath7 .",
    "the functional relation is then @xmath8 , which defines a stochastic mechanism that transforms @xmath9 to @xmath10 according to the conditional probability @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the kronecker delta .",
    "what distinguishes a causal mechanism from a generic conditional probability is the possibility of changing it via _ intervention _ , fig .",
    "[ intervention ] .",
    "causal relations are indeed defined by the possibility of intervening on a variable in the model and forcing it to assume some chosen value , thereby overriding the natural process that generates it .",

    "it is of no particular significance whether the intervention is performed by a human agent , a pre - programmed device , or nature itself .",
    "intervention variables simply represent parameters that have to be fixed independently of the variables that are included in the model itself , in order to extract predictions from it .",
    "the possibility of separating internal variables from external parameters is the fundamental assumption that allows for a causal interpretation of the model .",
    "accordingly , a variable @xmath9 is interpreted as a _ cause _ of another variable @xmath10 if correlations exist between @xmath21 and @xmath10 .",
    "a causal model captures the causal relations between a set of variables in terms of mechanisms and interventions , fig .  5 .",
    "the qualitative structure of cause - effect relations in a model defines a _ causal structure _ , which is represented as a directed acyclic graph .    a _ directed graph _ is a pair @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the set of _ vertices _ and",

    "a functional causal model is defined by a set of functions that determine the observed variables given their direct causes and possibly some noise .",
    "the markov assumption states that all noise variables are uncorrelated , leading to the following definition :    [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     however , it is clear that only the third dag provides an appropriate representation of the causal relations in @xmath29 , as it describes two uncorrelated laboratories .",
    "the dags in figs .",
    "[ finetuned](c ) , [ finetuned](d ) , on the other hand , require a specially selected mechanism that is unable to carry causal influence .",
    "this leads to the following definition ( analogous to the definition for classical causal models @xcite ) :    an mqcm @xmath30 is _ * faithful * _ if @xmath29 contains non - vanishing hs terms of all types compatible with the factorisation .",

    "the relations between laboratories in a dag directly correspond to causal relations . in appendix",
    "[ faithfulproof ] , the following theorem is proved .",
    "[ faithfultheorem ] given a faithful causal model @xmath49 for a set of laboratories @xmath41 , a laboratory @xmath45 is a _ direct cause _ for a laboratory @xmath50 if and only if @xmath45 is a parent of @xmath50 in @xmath31 .",
    "the ` only if ' part of the theorem is also true for non - faithful models .",
    "this property can be phrased as _ children are able to screen off the causal influence of their parents to the rest of the world_. this means that there exist instruments for the child laboratories that break the causal connections from their common parents to any other laboratory .",
    "the task of causal discovery is to find a causal structure , i.e.  a dag @xmath31 , which can explain a set of empirical data .",
    "faithful quantum causal models have two important properties in this respect :    [ unambiguous ] the causal structure of a faithful mqcmcan be discovered unambiguously ;    almost all causal models are faithful , in an appropriate measure - theoretic sense .",
    "these points are formalised in the following theorems .",
    "if two mqcms @xmath49 , @xmath51 for the same process matrix @xmath29 are both faithful , then @xmath52 .    as @xmath31 and",
    "@xmath53 have the same set of vertices , the only thing to prove is that they have the same set of edges .",
    "this is equivalent to proving that each laboratory has the same set of parents for @xmath31 and @xmath53 .",
    "the latter is a direct consequence of the fact that @xmath29 contains a term of type @xmath48 if and only if @xmath45 is a parent of @xmath32 , eq .  .",
    "thus , the hs terms contained in a faithful process matrix uniquely identify a causal structure .",
    "the hs terms can be fully determined if in each laboratory an informationally complete instrument is available . if only a subset of the hs terms is measured , the observed data can be compatible with more than one faithful causal model .",
    "this is analogous to the classical case : if arbitrary interventions are not available , it is not possible to fully characterise causal structure .",
    "the next theorem shows that , given a sufficiently regular prior knowledge on the causal structure of a model , there is vanishing probability that the model is fine - tuned ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the classical analogue ) .    given a set of laboratories @xmath54 , a dag @xmath55 and a non - singular measure on the space of process matrices that factorise over @xmath31 , the set of fine - tuned process matrices have measure zero .",
    "the set of process matrices that factorise over @xmath31 can be parametrised by @xmath56 real parameters , where @xmath56 is the number of hs terms implied by @xmath31 ( excluding the term of type @xmath57 , which has a constant coefficient ) .",
    "a non - singular measure on this set is a measure on @xmath58 that is non - singular with respect to the lebesgue measure .",
    "the set of fine - tuned process matrices is defined by having exactly vanishing coefficients for some of the implied hs terms , which is a zero - measure set for every non - singular measure .",
    "note that there is only a finite number of dags with the same vertex set .",
    "thus , a nonsingular measure over the space of causal models for a given set of laboratories decomposes as a finite sum of nonsingular measures for the individual dags .",
    "this implies the following corollary :    given a non - singular measure on the space of mqcms for a given set of laboratories @xmath54 , the set fine - tuned causal models has measure zero .",
    "the above results indicate that , given a set of possible causal explanations , a faithful one should be preferred because , unless additional information is available , a vanishing probability is assigned to fine - tuned models . in the presence of latent laboratories , faithfulness might not be sufficient to single out a unique causal model . in this case ,",
    "further assumptions would be needed to decide among a set of faithful causal explanations .",
    "it is important that classical causal models can be recovered from quantum ones in an appropriate limit . to ensure we are recovering classical models that can be considered _ causal",
    "_ , it is necessary to show that these models support identification via classical interventions .",
    "recall , this is the hallmark of the classical causal modelling methodology . as it will be shown in this section , to recover classical causal models it is sufficient that all available local operations can be described as classical interventions .",
    "the particular case of classical models conditioned on ` idle ' interventions , or equivalently ` purely observational ' bayesian networks , is recovered by further restricting local operations to projective measurements in a fixed basis it is crucial that _ all _ classical causal structures can be recovered in this way .",
    "this was not possible , for example , in the framework of ref .",
    "@xcite , where only a subset of dags was recovered in the classical limit .",
    "quantum systems effectively behave as classical ones in the limit where it is only possible to access and manipulate states in a fixed basis that factorises over separated systems ( called _ pointer basis _ ) . whether this condition is enforced by decoherence @xcite , collapse models @xcite ,",
    "` fuzzy measurements ' @xcite , or in other ways , will not be discussed here .",
    "rather , it will be shown that , provided the transition to classicality takes place , markov quantum causal models reduce to classical ones .    for a local laboratory @xmath59 in an mqcm , with output space factorised according to the outgoing edges , @xmath60 , consider cp maps of the form @xmath61}^{i_j}\\otimes{[\\vec{o}_j]}^{o_j } , \\label{diagonal}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 label the possible measurement outcomes , @xmath63 label the possible choices of instruments , @xmath64 and @xmath65}^{o_j } : = \\bigotimes_{e\\in{\\textsc{\\footnotesize out}\\xspace}_j}{[s_e]}^{{s}_e}$ ] .",
    "for a fixed basis , cp maps of this form can be interpreted as follows : a classical system enters the laboratory in some state labelled by @xmath66 , a value @xmath62 is recorded as a measurement outcome and , for each outgoing edge @xmath43 , a system is sent out of the laboratory in the state @xmath67 .",

    "it is necessary to further restrict the possible local operations . in particular",
    ", the variables @xmath68 , responsible for transmitting causal influence out of the laboratory , should be influenced directly only by the observed variables @xmath62 ( and only indirectly by @xmath63 and @xmath66 ) : @xmath69    given the above conditions , the statistics generated by a markov quantum causal model are equivalent to those generated by a classical causal model _ with the same causal structure_. the proof of the following theorem is in appendix [ prooflimit ] .",

    "the result above not only shows that classical causal models can be subsumed by quantum ones , but also provides a direct way to apply classical tools to quantum models . indeed ,",
    "classical models are recovered under restrictions on the performed operations .",
    "such restrictions can arise because of uncontrolled factors , such as environmental decoherence , but it is also possible to simply _ choose _ to use only instruments compatible with a classical description .",
    "thus , all properties of classical causal models directly extend to quantum ones , conditioned on the choice of classical instruments .",
    "for example , in classical causal models , if @xmath81 is the only common cause of @xmath82 and @xmath83 , it follows from the causal markov condition that @xmath82 and @xmath83 are conditionally independent given @xmath81 : @xmath84 , where it is understood that such a property holds conditioned on the ` idle ' intervention .",
    "such a property still holds for quantum causal models , conditioned on the choice of appropriate instruments : if @xmath85 is a quantum common cause of @xmath86 and @xmath87 , then @xmath88 for all instruments @xmath89 satisfying conditions , .",
    "the results of the previous section show that the causal structure of a markov process , represented by a dag , remains unaltered in the quantum - to - classical transition .",
    "thus , the quantum causal models discussed above are ` quantum ' only by virtue of the physics describing the systems that convey causal influence . the _ causal structure _ itself is not different to that of classical models .    the formalism , however , can be naturally extended to more general structures . _",

    "a process of the form is still compatible with a definite , albeit unknown , causal structure , which can be understood as an objective property that exists independently of the operations performed .",
    "the natural next step is to look for causal structures that might be , in some sense , _ indefinite_. that space - time itself might have quantum properties in a theory of quantum gravity motivates this idea @xcite .",

    "if @xmath97 prepares a state @xmath98 , the laboratories in @xmath99 find themselves in the causal relations dictated by @xmath31 ( and the control system is transferred undisturbed to @xmath100 ) .",

    "this type of resource can be shown to be incompatible with any definite causal order @xcite and thus in particular with any dag .",
    "additionally , the quantum switch can provide an advantage for several tasks @xcite and an experimental proof - of - principle was recently demonstrated @xcite , showing the potential practical relevance of quantum causal structures .",
    "the process can be interpreted as the superposition of different amplitudes , each corresponding to a directed , acyclic causal structure .",
    "it is an interesting question whether more general causal models can also be understood in a similar way .",
    "an indication that this might not be the case is the fact that processes of the form can not violate _ causal inequalities _ @xcite whereas more general processes allowed by the formalism can @xcite .",

    "the possibility of closed time - like curves ( ctcs ) in general relativity @xcite motivates considering models that contain directed cycles .",
    "the process matrix formalism provides a natural framework for studying ctcs as cyclic causal structures , as the possibility of interventions , and thus the causal interpretation of the model , does not rely on the acyclicity property .",
