    "algebraic surfaces are classified by discrete and continuous invariants . fixing the discrete invariants",
    "gives a family of algebraic surfaces parameterized by algebraic variety called the moduli space .",
    "all surfaces in the same moduli space have the same homotopy type and therefore the same fundamental group .",
    "so , fundamental groups are discrete invariants of the surfaces and form a central tool in their classification .",
    "we have no algorithm to compute the fundamental group of a given projective algebraic surface @xmath14 but we can cover @xmath0 by a surface @xmath15 with a computable fundamental group .",
    "the surface @xmath15 is the galois cover of @xmath14 and its fundamental group is a crucial invariant of the surface @xmath4 it is connected with the fundamental group of the complement of the branch curve of a generic projection of the surface @xmath4    one common solution to this problem is to degenerate @xmath0 to a union of planes , whose branch curve is a line arrangement in the plane .",
    "the fundamental groups of line arrangements are easily computable and can be exploited to obtain information on the original branch curve and on the original surface .",
    "the idea of using degenerations for these purposes appears in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "degenerations of @xmath16 surfaces were constructed in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and are called _",
    "pillow degenerations_.    in recent years , braid groups have been becoming more and more popular in different branches of mathematics , such as the theory of jones polynomials ( which is a current interest of theoretical physicists ) .",
    "former studies show that some nontrivial properties of braid groups are intimately connected with the existence of nontrivial geometrical objects of complex geometry and algebraic surfaces .",
    "thus , our study of algebraic surfaces and their branch curves gives new insight in the field of braid groups and vice versa .",
    "the applications of the braid group technique to the study of algebraic curves in general and to the topology of complements of curves in particular , started with artin in @xcite and @xcite ; see also chisini @xcite and van kampen @xcite .",
    "the braid monodromy technique is due to ideas of chisini , enriques , zariski and van kampen in the 30 s ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it was revived by moishezon in the late 1970s , and was first presented in a complete form by moishezon in @xcite and @xcite , and moishezon - teicher in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "many examples of computations of braid monodromy have been executed , see for example in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "also , in @xcite one can find a description of computations of braid monodromy and the fundamental group @xmath17 of the complement of the branch curve of a surface .    in @xcite",
    ", the authors also considered the branch curve of a projection of a non - prime @xmath16 surface .",
    "but they considered quotients of @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the branch curve , by a subgroup of commutators ( commutators of geometric generators which are mapped to disjoint transpositions by the geometric monodromy representation , see definition 2.2 in that paper ) .",
    "their motivation came from the theory of symplectic manifolds and families of projections where the branch curves acquire and may lose pairs of transverse double points with opposite orientations ; creating a pair of double points adds a commutation relation .",
    "the quotient there is the largest possible quotient of @xmath17 .",
    "several other small cases have been considered individually : in @xcite , the authors compute the fundamental group of the complement of the branch curve of the cayley cubic surface , and in @xcite , they compute it for the @xmath20 embedding of the hirzebruch surface @xmath21 ( @xcite also computes the fundamental group of the galois cover of complete intersections . ) in @xcite and @xcite , the authors compute the fundamental group of the complement of the branch curve for the second hirzebruch surface and for the product of a projective line and a torus , respectively",
    ".    fundamental groups of galois covers were first considered in @xcite @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite , we encounter new types of singularities , namely @xmath22-points , local intersection points of three distinct lines , which had not been handled before , and whose analysis is necessary for the precise computations of the braid monodromy .",
    "moreover , since the monodromies related to @xmath23-points ( first discussed in @xcite and @xcite ) are quite hard to follow , @xcite presents them in a precise way algebraically , accompanied by figures illustrating the computations .",
    "@xcite deals with the hirzebruch surface @xmath24 @xcite and @xcite deal with covers of hirzebruch surfaces , while @xcite deals with the product of two tori , whose branch curve was first investigated in @xcite .",
    "robb @xcite computed the fundamental groups for complete intersection surfaces .",
    "the @xmath6-point appears first in a local computation in @xcite ; we show it here in the context of an explicit algebraic surface .",
    "the goals of this paper are twofold : first , to survey the fundamental groups of the complements of the branch curves and of the galois covers of all degenerations of surfaces of low degrees ( less than 5 ) , and second , to complete the classification of galois covers of @xmath25 which was begun in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .      in order to compute the possible fundamental group of the galois cover of a surface of small degree with at worst isolated singularities and with a nice degeneration , we degenerate the surface to a union of planes , and then apply the regeneration process .",
    "the algebra is independent of the specific choice of surface , as it is determined entirely combinatorially .",
    "therefore , to construct the set of all possible such fundamental groups of galois covers of surfaces of degrees @xmath26 @xmath22 and @xmath27 we construct combinatorial representations of each of the possible admissible arrangements of two , three or four planes , i.e. , those in which no two planes meet in a line , and we verify that each of them in fact corresponds to a degeneration of some algebraic surface .",
    "note that there are many possible plane arrangements corresponding to each diagram ; however , the fundamental groups of the complement of the branch curve and of the galois cover are determined combinatorially , and are thus independent of the specific arrangement .",
    "we then calculate the braid monodromy factorization and the fundamental groups using the method of moishezon - teicher .",
    "we present the computations in some detail for the convenience of the reader , and so as to make all the examples completely explicit .",

    "[ quadric ] , we consider the unique smooth quadric surface that degenerates to two planes . in subsection",
    "[ cubics ] , we consider the two possible cubics : in [ f1 ] , we analyze the ( 1,1 ) embedding of the hirzebruch surface @xmath8 as a smooth cubic . in [ cayley ] , we recall the degeneration of the cayley cubic , which is singular , but note that there are also smooth surfaces that share that degeneration , and analyze the fundamental group of its galois cover . in subsection",
    "[ quartics ] , we consider the five possible quartics : in [ f2 ] , we recall the ( 1,1 ) embedding of the hirzebruch surface @xmath21 in [ v4 ] , we recall the embedding of the veronese surface @xmath141 and provide a more explicit analysis of its fundamental groups , and in [ f0 - 12 ] we analyze the @xmath142 embedding of the hirzebruch surface @xmath143 or @xmath144 in [ cayley+ ] we analyze the new case of a quartic surface degenerating to the union of a plane and the cayley cubic degeneration , and in [ 4-pt ] we analyze the case of a quartic degenerating to a @xmath6-point .    in the appendix , section [ app ] , we analyze for completeness those cases of @xmath145 not covered by the moishezon - teicher theorem @xcite , namely the @xmath11 embedding and the @xmath13 embedding for all positive integers @xmath146",
    "throughout this paper , we use the standard triangulation representation in which triangles denote planes , internal edges denote lines of intersection ( we do not consider the boundary edges as they do not define well defined lines ) and points of intersection of the internal edges denote points of intersection of the corresponding planes , and every arrangement is assumed to be embedded in the smallest dimensional projective space .",
    "it is clear that every plane arrangement can be represented by a triangulation as long as no three planes meet in a line and no plane meets more than three other planes . in degrees",
    "less than @xmath147 the second condition is vacuous . for the triangulation to represent a meaningful planar degeneration ,",
    "it is necessary that if exactly two triangles meet at a point , they must meet along an edge , and if three or more triangles meet at a point , the dual graph of the triangulation must be connected .",
    "the reason is that the branch curve of an irreducible surface ( and hence of a smooth surface or a surface with only isolated non - removable singularities ) is connected .",
    "hence the branch curve of the degeneration must also be connected . moreover",
    ", the triangulation is planar since we can consider the edge graph of the triangulation , and by kuratowski s theorem , every non - planar graph contains a subgraph homeomorphic to the complete graph @xmath148 or the complete bipartite graph @xmath149 neither of which is possible for triangulations of degree less than @xmath150 conversely , any triangulation determines a plane arrangement in a projective space of sufficiently high degree .",

    "the plane arrangement is not unique , but its combinatorial invariants , and therefore , in particular , its braid monodromy factorization and the fundamental group of the complement of the branch curve , are well defined .",

    "the simplest connected arrangement is that shown in figure [ trap3 ] .",
