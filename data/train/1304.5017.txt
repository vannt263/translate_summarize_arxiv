    "however , before the embryo attains the critical core mass , collisional fragmentation induced by gravitational stirring stalls the growth of the embryo @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that fragment accretion enhanced by tenuous atmospheres allowed formation of massive cores .",
    "@xcite meanwhile pointed out that combination of gas drag and stirring by an embryo inhibits the accretion of fragments with radii larger than 30 m onto the embryo .",
    "however , the typical fragment radius is smaller than 30 m and hence the obstacle to fragment accretion is negligible ( see the discussion in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "since the removal of fragments due to radial drift is more effective than accretion , embryos can not reach the critical core mass starting from small initial planetesimals . although the core formation must be completed before gas depletion ,",
    "the formation timescale of a core is longer than @xmath150 for large planetesimals , for which initial runaway growth or cores is slow .",
    "therefore , jupiter s core is likely to have formed from accretion of intermediate size planetesimals in a massive disk @xcite .",
    "jupiter s gas accretion was truncated by its gap opening . at the edge of the gap ,",
    "a radial pressure maximum was created .",
    "small fragments accumulated at the pressure maximum , which might have lead to the formation of saturn s core in @xmath151yr @xcite .",
    "heat released by solid accretion stabilizes atmospheres of cores and delays the rapid gas accretion to form gas giant planets , and hence high solid accretion rates of cores result in large cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "saturn s core is estimated to be larger than jupiter s core @xcite , which is difficult to explain in classical core formation models .",
    "@xcite recently proposed a core formation scenario by accretion of sub - meter sized pebble , which also produces a higher accretion rate for jupiter unless the pebble surface density has a flat radial profile ( the radial slope @xmath152 ) .",
    "a promising model to explain saturn s large core relative to jupiter is if saturn s core was formed at the gap opened by jupiter @xcite .    in the context of the model of @xcite , which uses the same prescriptions as used in the present contribution ,",
    "jupiter and saturn can be formed in limited conditions for planetesimal sizes and disk masses .",
    "large planetesimals @xmath153200 km in a massive disk @xmath154 are required to form a massive core of @xmath155 at 5.2au for jupiter @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the larger core of saturn requires very rapid formation , which is realized by fragment accretion at the pressure maximum caused by jupiter s gap opening in the solar nebula .",
    "this yields an additional constraint described empirically by the relationship @xmath156 @xcite .",
    "both conditions for formation of the cores of jupiter and saturn are satisfied for @xmath157 and @xmath158100 km ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cont_mass_ew ] ) .    as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : cont_mass_ew][fig : ti ] , the conditions required to explain the accretion of the cores of jupiter and saturn are inconsistent with those inferred for mars .",
    "the condition required for jupiter and saturn formation produces earth - sized or larger embryos in the terrestrial planet region and the predicted @xmath159 adopting @xmath160 for earth s mantle is @xmath161 , which is much larger than @xmath162 in terrestrial rocks @xcite .",
    "one way to try to reconcile the apparently inconsistent conditions inferred for mars on the one hand and jupiter and saturn on the other hand is to modify the disk surface density . in the discussion above and in fig .",
    "[ fig : cont_mass_ew][fig : ti ] , we assumed @xmath163 .",
    "it is possible for instance that the disk surface density had a shallower radial slope of @xmath164 .",
    "the conditions for forming the cores of jupiter and saturn become @xmath165 and @xmath166 km . if we use a massive disk of 0.1 solar mass required by jupiter formation , the radius of initial planetesimals for mars formation becomes less than 5 km for @xmath167 .",
    "changing the disk density profile does not seem to solve the discrepancy that exists between mars and the giant planets .",
    "a way to reconcile the constraints derived from inner and outer solar system bodies is if planets formed in a relatively massive solar nebula ( @xmath168 ) but planetesimals sizes were different in the inner and outer regions . in this scenario , jupiter and saturn cores",
    "would have formed from planetesimals of 50 km radius while mars formed from smaller planetesimals of @xmath133 km radius .",
    "@xcite proposed that 100 km or larger planetesimals were necessary to explain the mass distribution of asteroids in the main belt , but @xcite concluded that planetesimals of 100 m size could also reproduce the asteroid mass distribution .",
    "the sizes of planetesimals are related to their formation mechanisms ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the heliocentric gradient in planetesimal sizes discussed here may be related to the inferred contrast in solid surface densities and material properties across the snow line .",

    "according to @xcite , contribution of large bodies to the @xmath103w evolution of the martian mantle is negligible .",

    "<S> two scenarios can explain the rapid formation of small mars : ( i ) it formed by accretion of small planetesimals in a massive disk or ( ii ) it formed from large planetesimals but its growth was arrested by the inward then outward migration of jupiter . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account all constraints , we conclude that mars is likely to have formed in a massive disk of about @xmath1 solar mass from planetesimals smaller than @xmath2 km in radius . </S>",
