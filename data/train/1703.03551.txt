    "a distinct method to explore the explosion dynamics of sne , therefore , would be to investigate the detailed chemical and kinematic properties of sn ejecta material in nearby young galactic supernova remnants ( snrs ) where the imprints of explosion remain .",
    "cassiopeia a ( hereafter cas a ) , at the age of @xmath3 years @xcite , is one of the best studied young galactic snrs .",
    "its sn explosion was classified as type iib based on the optical spectra of light echoes @xcite , which implies that the progenitor was probably a star of @xmath4@xmath5 that had lost a significant portion , but not all , of its h - rich envelope before the explosion .",
    "over the past several decades , cas  a has been extensively studied in almost all wavebands from radio to gamma - rays .",
    "the complex spatial distribution of _ shocked _ sn ejecta , such as the x - ray - emitting fe - rich ejecta plumes beyond the si - rich material and o / s - rich optical knots outlying the bright ejecta shell ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "furthermore , the inhomogeneous distribution of _ unshocked _ sn ejecta radiating si and ti emission lines @xcite implies that the explosion was turbulent near the progenitor core .    in the visible waveband ,",
    "many bright optical knots are presented in and around cas a. they have been classified into two major groups based on their proper motions and line - of - sight velocities : ( 1 ) fast - moving knots ( fmks ) and ( 2 ) quasi - stationary flocculi ( qsfs )",
    ". the fmks show large proper motions and high radial velocities , corresponding to expansion velocities of up to @xmath6 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they have spectral features strongly enhanced in o and other heavy elements ( e.g. , s and ar ) that are mostly synthesized from the nuclear burning process in a deep stellar layer , while showing no detectable h or he emission lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "based on their high expansion velocities and chemical composition , they have been regarded as dense material ejected from the disrupted layer of the progenitor after the sn explosion .",
    "the dynamical and chemical properties of the qsfs are very different from those of the fmks .",
    "the qsfs have considerably slower velocities ( @xmath7 ) , and so their typical expansion age is @xmath8 years @xcite , which is much larger than the age of the remnant .",
    "they are bright in [ ]  and h@xmath9  emission , with a handful of other h and he emission lines , in optical spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "considering these properties , qsfs are believed to be dense circumstellar medium ( csm ) blown out from the progenitor prior to the sn explosion .",
    "in addition , some intermediate optical knots , that is , the so called fast - moving flocculi ( fmfs ) or nitrogen knots ( nks ) , were reported by @xcite . while their spectra , which show strong [ ]  6548 , 6583  accompanied by weak h@xmath9  without any lines of o and s , are analogous to those of qsfs @xcite , their proper motions are larger than @xmath10 , corresponding to @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "most of them have been found outside of the bright main ejecta shell .",
    "therefore , these outlying n - rich knots have been interpreted as being fragments of the progenitor s photosphere expelled by the sn blast wave at the time of explosion .",
    "the dynamical and chemical properties of these different types of optical knots have provided important clues to unveiling the snr s origin and evolution .",
    "for example , the expansion center and age were determined from the proper motions of the fmks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and the three - dimensional ( 3d ) structure of the ejecta knots reconstructed from spectral mapping observations has shown that the sn ejecta is expanding spherically but is systematically receding at a speed of @xmath12 at a distance of 3.4 kpc @xcite .",
    "the dense , slow - moving qsfs indicate that the progenitor had undergone significant and inhomogeneous mass loss during the red supergiant phase @xcite .",
    "although this velocity - based classification is an efficient way to classify the knots as sn ejecta and csm , which have distinctive expansion velocities , i.e. , a few @xmath13 vs. a few @xmath14 , it encounters limitations when characterizing the sn ejecta material from the different nucleosynthetic layers .",
    "according to previous numerical simulations for core - collapse sn explosions , the radial velocity profiles of heavy elements in sn ejecta are almost identical @xcite .",
    "several models in @xcite predict the velocity separation of up to @xmath15 between different heavy elements .",
    "their velocity profiles , however , are very broad ( a few @xmath13 ) , so that their distributions largely overlap . these numerical simulations may imply that sn material from different nucleosynthetic layers is barely distinguishable in velocity space . in order to comprehend the explosion dynamics , therefore , a more systematic classification of sn ejecta based on their chemical composition is needed .    in this paper , we report the results of broad near - infrared ( nir ) spectroscopic observations toward the main ejecta shell of cas a , focusing on classification of the emission knots based on their _ spectrochemical _ properties . the nir study of cas a has been relatively limited in the literature , although there are many bright forbidden lines of various elements in the nir waveband , some of which may arise from the deep nucleosynthetic layers . as far as we are aware , the only nir spectroscopic study covering the entire _ jhk _ bandpass was conducted by @xcite , who obtained low - resolution ( @xmath16 ) spectra of five fmks and three qsfs that were previously known .",
    "they showed that the spectra of the fmks are dominated by [ ]  1.029 , 1.032 , 1.034 , 1.037 ( hereafter [ ]  1.03  multiplets ) and [ ]  1.188 , as well as two high - ionization si lines , [ ]  1.963  and [ ]  1.430 , while those of the qsfs show strong he i  1.083 accompanied by h emission lines .",

    "finally , the paper is summarized in section  [ sec - sum ] .",
    "we carried out nir spectroscopic observations of cas a using triplespec mounted on the palomar 5 m hale telescope .",
    "triplespec is a cross - dispersed nir spectrograph that provides simultaneous wavelength coverage from 0.94 to 2.46 at a spectral resolving power of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the spectrograph uses two adjacent quadrants , i.e. , @xmath18 pixels , of a rockwell scientific hawaii - ii array .",
    "the slit width and length are 1  and 30 , respectively . on 2008",
    "june 29 and august 8 , we obtained spectra at eight slit positions along the main ejecta shell ( figure  [ fig - slit ] ) .",
    "the orientations of slits 1 and 4 were set perpendicular to the shell , while those of the others were largely parallel to the shell .",
    "the nearby a0v star hd223386 was observed as a spectroscopic standard right before and/or after the target observations at similar airmasses .",
    "in addition to the target spectra , we also obtained spectra of sky background by dithering along the slit or taking spectra of nearby sky , depending on the complexity of the target fields .",
    "the total on - source exposure time at each slit position ranges from 300 to 1800 s. the detailed parameters of the spectroscopic observations are provided in table  [ tbl - log ] .",
    "we developed an idl - based data reduction pipeline to reduce the obtained triplespec data .",
    "the pipeline first performed subtraction of a dark frame and flat fielding , followed by subtraction of sky background emission .",
    "for the latter , we used sky background emission obtained in a dithered frame or in a frame from nearby empty sky , depending on the complexity of the source emission in a given slit . because of the non - uniform dispersion by the three cross - dispersing prisms in triplespec @xcite , some orders of the triplespec spectra are severely curved . by carefully tracing the spectra of standard stars and airglow emission lines",
    ", we obtained a 2d wavelength solution for each order that can correct this effect in a satisfactory manner .",
    "we conducted fifth - order order polynomial fits to the wavelengths of the oh airglow emission lines @xcite in the triplespec spectra to obtain the wavelength solutions at 0.5   @xmath19 uncertainty for each order .",
    "heliocentric velocity correction was also performed when calculating the velocity of the emission line detected in the triplespec spectra .",
    "we used an a0v - type standard star ( hd223386 ) in the photometric calibration and confirmed that the fluxes of the [ ]  1.644  emission line are consistent with those from the narrow - band imaging observations of the same areas ( see section  [ sec - obs - img ] ) .",

    "we used an [ ]  narrow - band filter that has a mean wavelength of 1.644  and a bandwidth of 252  .",
    "while the single exposure time per frame in 2005 and 2008 is 60 s and 200 s , the multiple dithering observations yield total integration times of 1200 s and 5400 s , respectively .",
    "we also obtained h - continuum narrow - band images ( mean wavelength of 1.570  and bandwidth of 236  ) in order to subtract the bright stars in the [ ]  narrow - band images .",
    "the average seeing throughout our observations was @xmath24 fwhm .",
    "we followed standard procedures for the reduction of nir imaging data .",
    "first , the dark and sky background were subtracted from each individual dithered frame .",
    "then , all of the frames were divided by the normalized flat image .",
    "the astrometric solution was derived on the basis of unsaturated stars around the remnant in the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) point - source catalog ( psc ; * ? ? ?",
    "we coadded all dithered frames which were astrometrically aligned . in terms of photometric calibration ,",
    "h_-band magnitude in the 2mass system was used by assuming that the [ ]  narrow - band magnitude is the same as the _ h_-band magnitude .",
    "the uncertainty in the zero - point magnitude we derived is less than 0.1 mag , corresponding to the 10% of the flux .",

    "the emission features are complex , often with multiple peaks , and so the identification of individual ` knots ' by visual inspection is not straightforward .",

    "the [ ]  1.1881  line was included in the list of identified lines in three qsfs in cas a and the kepler snr by @xcite , but we consider that this was a misidentification of the [ ]  1.1883  line . the expected flux of the [ ]  1.1881  line in typical conditions ( e.g. , @xmath28 k , @xmath29",
    "@xmath30 ) in snrs is almost negligible , i.e. , its flux relative to the [ ]  1.257  line is @xmath31 , whereas the [ ]  1.1883  line could be as strong as @xmath32 of the [ ]  1.257  line for cosmic abundance , or even higher if fe atoms are locked into dust grains @xcite .",
    "in order to systematically characterize the spectral properties of the 63 knots , which have 46 emission lines in total , we applied the pca method .",

    ", we apply an extinction correction using the line ratio of the [ ]  1.257 and 1.644  emission .",
    "these two lines originate from the same upper level ( @xmath33 ) and therefore their intrinsic flux ratio ( @xmath34_{\\rm int}$ ] ) depends on the einstein a - coefficients ( @xmath35 ) and their wavelengths , i.e. , @xmath34_{\\rm int}=(a_{ki,1.257}/1.257)/(a_{ki,1.644}/1.644)$ ] .",

    "the derived extinctions are listed in table  [ tbl - knot ] . in our previous work @xcite",
    ", we showed that the extinction toward the west is systematically larger than that toward the east , which is consistent with the previous optical / x - ray extinction estimates ( see figure  1 in * ? ? ?",
    "we further showed that the extinctions of red - shifted knots are systematically higher than those of the blue - shifted knots , implying the presence of a large amount of sn dust inside and around the main ejecta shell ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "the lines from the same upper level in the dereddened spectral data do not provide independent information any more , so that the number of attributes in the pca are now reduced from 46 to 23 . in order to prevent a few bright lines dominating the pca ,",
    "the line intensities are standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation .",
    "since we use the mean - subtracted data , the zero pcs represent the location of mean brightness , not the location of the zero fluxes of the lines ( hereafter convergent point ) , which is important for our classification ( see section  [ sec - pca - result - pc ] ) . in order to get the pc coefficients of a knot indicating the convergent point",
    "when all the emission lines of a knot get close to zero flux , we add one artificial knot into the data set that has emission lines with zero flux .",
    "table  [ tbl - pca ] contains the relative and cumulative fraction of variances contributed by the 10 most significant pcs . the first three pcs account for the majority , i.e. , @xmath3785% , of the spectral information ; thus , we use them in our classification of the knots .",

    "we see in figure  [ fig - atr ] that the attributes can be largely divided into three groups , each of which is composed of several strongly correlated spectral lines .",
    "( note that the cosine of the angle between the vectors on the plots measures the linear correlation between the emission lines ; see @xcite for example . ) the first group ( hereafter ` he group ' ) is composed of h i , he i , and [ ]  lines .",
    "these lines are almost perfectly correlated with each other .",
    "the lengths of their vectors are close to unity in the pc1-pc3 plane , which means that these spectral lines are properly accounted for by pc1 and pc3 . the second group ( ` s group ' ) is composed of [ ] , [ ] , and ionized s emission lines .",
    "these lines are also strongly correlated with each other and mostly contributed by pc2 and pc3 in the direction orthogonal to the he group lines . the last group ( ` fe group ' ) is composed of ionized fe emission lines , i.e. , [ ]  and [ ]  lines .",
    "these lines are rather loosely correlated but are still generally well separated from the lines in the other two groups .",
    "the [ ]  2.046 and 2.224  lines in particular appear somewhat distinct from the other [ ]  lines",
    ". this might be caused by the higher excitation energies of the two lines than those of the other lines , i.e. , @xmath38 k vs. @xmath39 k.    we plot the pc coefficients of the 63 knots on the pc planes in figure  [ fig - obj ] .",

    "they showed that the relative abundance of p ( a major product of the stellar ne - burning layer ) to fe ( in number ) for the he - rich knots is similar to the solar abundance , whereas that of the s - rich knots is 10100 times higher than the solar abundance .",
    "the characteristics of the two types of knots match well with those of qsfs and fmks known from previous optical studies ( see section  [ sec - int ] for a summary of their properties ) . similar to the optical qsfs ,",
    "the he - rich knots have bright he i  lines together with h i  and [ ]  lines ; all the he - rich knots have a he i  1.083  line , 6 out of the 7 show h i  pa@xmath56 , br@xmath57 lines , and the three brightest ones also have [ ]  1.040 , 1.041  lines .",
    "like the optical fmks dominated by lines of ionized heavy elements o , s , ar , the s - rich knots show strong s lines plus [ ]  and [ ]  lines ; all the s - rich knots have [ ]  1.03  multiplets , and 39 out of 45 s - rich knots also have [ ]  1.188  and/or [ ]  1.963  lines .",
    "indeed , the overall spectra of he - rich and s - rich knots are similar to the nir spectra of qsfs and fmks obtained by @xcite , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the radial velocities of the two nir knot groups are well consistent with those of the optical groups . for example , the radial velocity of the he - rich knots is @xmath58 , while the generally accepted radial velocity of qsfs is @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the median line - of - sight velocity of s - rich knots is @xmath60 , while the systematic velocity of the fmks is @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "rich emission lines of si , p , and s in the s - rich knots and fmks imply that they are the sn ejecta originated from the ne- and o - burning layers .",
    "the two bright emission lines , [ ]  1.188  and [ ]  1.644  , have comparable excitation energies and critical densities , and so their line ratios are strongly dependent on their abundance ratio , @xmath62(p / fe ) @xcite . as seen in figure  [ fig - fluxratio ]",
    ", there is a large scatter in this line ratio for s - rich knots , which implies that the abundance ratio @xmath62(p / fe ) varies almost two orders of magnitude for these knots .",
    "we also found that 13 out of 45 s - rich knots have clear but relatively weak emission lines of he i  and/or [ ] .",
    "the detection of the he , c , and fe lines in the s - rich ejecta , which are either lighter or heavier elements than the o - burning materials , might infer microscopic mixing during the sn explosion . in many s - rich knots , a highly ionized si line , [ ]  1.963 , is detected , while in a few s - rich knots , a [ ]  1.645  line is also detected .",
    "the detection of si in very different ionization stages indicates the broad range of temperatures in the s - rich knots .      in section  [ sec - pca - result ] , we found that the fe - rich knots exhibit intermediate characteristics between he - rich and s - rich knots ; they emit strong [ ]  lines without any si , p , and s lines , but have high line - of - sight speeds of up to @xmath63",
    "a few knots also emit an he i  1.083  line .",
    "the high velocities , however , suggest that they are not dense qsfs represented by the he - rich knots .",
    "their line widths are also considerably broader than those of he - rich knots , i.e. , 1035    vs. 510    ( figure  [ fig - hist ] ) . on the other hand , the missing si , p , and s lines",
    "indicate that the abundances of these ne- and o - burning elements are very low in these fe - rich knots .",
    "we can consider two possible explanations regarding the origin of the fe - rich knots : ( 1 ) swept - up csm around contact discontinuity ( cd ) or ( 2 ) shocked sn ejecta enriched with fe elements that had been synthesized in explosive si burning .",
    "the ambient medium that the cas a sn blast wave is propagating into is believed to be csm with an @xmath64 density distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in such a case , 1d similarity solutions show that the shocked csm accumulates at the cd with infinite density asymptotically @xcite .",
    "we thus expect `` dense '' csm expanding at a speed comparable to the shocked sn material . in the real situation ,",
    "however , this interacting region between the shocked sn ejecta and the shocked csm is hydrodynamically unstable and distorted , with the density of the shocked csm limited to @xmath65 times the density at the ambient shock @xcite . the temperature of the shocked csm near the cd , therefore , may be lower than the typical temperature ( @xmath66 kev ) of the shocked csm @xcite , but probably no more than a factor of 10 , and all of the fe in the shocked csm will be in high ionization stages . furthermore , h i  lines are not detected in all fe - rich knots with an upper limit of f(h i - pa@xmath56)/f([]-1.257 ) @xmath67 . note that the observed ratio of these line intensities ranges between 0.05 and 10 for snrs while it is @xmath68 for orion , which should be the typical ratios for shocked and photoionized gases of cosmic abundance , respectively @xcite .",
    "therefore , h must be depleted in fe - rich knots .",
    "the non - detection of he and n lines might also indicate that the abundances of these ` circumstellar ' elements are very low in fe - rich knots , although this needs to be confirmed from other waveband observations .",
    "( see the next paragraph for an explanation of the faint he lines detected in some fe - rich knots . )",
    "we may therefore conclude that the fe - rich knots are not likely the shocked csm .",
    "this leaves the second possibility , i.e. , the fe - rich knots are fe - enriched sn ejecta .",
    "the high velocities and large velocity widths are consistent with sn ejecta being swept up by the reverse shock .",
    "the low [ ]  and [ ]  fluxes compared to the [ ]  flux , however , implies that the abundances of p and s , which are ne- and o - burning materials , are very low , which is in sharp contrast to the s - rich knots .",
    "these characteristics strongly suggest that _ the fe - rich knots are most likely `` pure '' fe ejecta synthesized in the deepest stellar interior . _",
    "the weak he i  1.083  line detected in some fe - rich knots could be due to an @xmath9-rich freeze - out process during the explosive si burning ; just after the explosion , complete si burning with an @xmath9-rich freeze - out occurs under high temperatures and low density conditions in the stellar deep layer , and many alpha particles are `` frozen out '' without participating in further nucleosynthetic processes @xcite .",
    "similar dense , fe - predominant ejecta , likely from the @xmath9-rich freeze - out process , have been detected in another young core - collapse snr g11.2 - 0.3 @xcite .",
    "pure fe ejecta have been detected in x - rays ( see below ) but not in optical or nir wavebands .",
    "this is surprising considering the extensive optical / nir studies carried out for cas a since its discovery .",
    "figure  [ fig - knotpos ] partly gives an answer . in the right panel of figure  [ fig - knotpos ]",
    ", red is an [ ]  1.644  narrow - band image while green and blue are _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) acs / wfc f850lp and f775w images which are dominated by ionized s and o lines , respectively @xcite .",
    "previous optical observations had been mostly toward the northern ejecta shell bright in ionized o , s , and ar lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or toward fmks outside the main shell ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig - knotpos ] , however , shows that the southwestern ( sw ) main ejecta shell , which is bright in the [ ]  line but faint in the ionized o and s lines , is the region where fe - rich ejecta can be found .",
    "indeed , our result shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig - knotpos ] confirms this ; 9 out of 11 fe - rich knots are located in slits 46 .",
    "( note that the compact red knots in the interior and beyond the sw shell are mostly qsfs , and they are bright in [ ]  6548 , 6583   and h@xmath9 images too @xcite . )",
    "the slit positions are determined from an [ ]  1.644  image , so that some of them were placed toward the red portions of the main ejecta shell and , by decomposing the emission into individual velocity components , we were able to identify fe - rich ejecta .",
    "it is worth noting that @xcite also noted the bright [ ]  emission in the sw shell in their [ ]  1.644  image of cas a. meanwhile , we can see that the [ ]  17.9  emission is much brighter than the emission from o - burning elements such as ar and s in the sw shell in the _ spitzer _ mid - infrared maps of ionic lines @xcite .",
    "our result suggests that this [ ]  emission - predominant area , i.e. , the red area of the sw ejecta shell in figure  [ fig - knotpos ] , is probably mainly composed of fe ejecta .",
    "it is not easy to identify the counterpart of fe - rich knots in optical images because several velocity components are usually superposed along the line of sight toward the main ejecta shell .",
    "the brightest fe - rich knot ( knot 10 in slit 5 ; hereafter k10 ) , however , is somewhat isolated and we can identify its counterpart . in figure [ fig - k10 ] , the upper two images are [ ]  1.644  images at different epochs and they show that k10 is a clump of @xmath69 elongated along the slit .",
    "the two [ ]  images clearly show that the clump is moving fast tangentially . the proper motion is measured @xmath70 yr@xmath22 , implying a tangential velocity of @xmath71 . in the lower f775w and f850lp images",
    ", we see diffuse faint emission at the position of k10 ( see the red contour ) .",
    "its brightness distribution is different , with two small ( @xmath72 ) bright spots ( s1 and s2 in the figure ) in the lower part of the clump .",
    "one of these bright spots , s1 , is coincident with an s - rich knot ( knot 9 in slit 5 ) , which is spatially coincident with k10 but has a line - of - sight velocity ( @xmath47 ) that is very different from that of k10 ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "the other bright spot , s2 , must also be due to an s - rich knot not detected in our spectroscopy .",
    "so excluding these two bright knots , k10 appears faint in f775w and f850lp images .",
    "we suspect that most of the diffuse emission in the f775w and f850lp images is due to optical [ ]  lines .",
    "this can be confirmed by optical spectroscopy .",
    "recently , there have been optical spectral mapping observations of cas a @xcite and , in principle , a similar analysis can be done to detect fe - rich knots , although the optical [ ]  lines , e.g. , [ ]  7155 and 8617   lines , will be much fainter than the [ ]  1.644  line because of large interstellar extinction ( @xmath7410 mag ) toward cas a ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the distribution and amount of fe ejecta in cas a have been a subject of controversy .",
    "previous x - ray studies detected hot and diffuse `` pure '' fe ejecta with mass @xmath75 that might have formed by @xmath9-rich freeze - out during the complete si burning @xcite .",
    "these x - ray - emitting shocked fe ejecta are distributed mainly in the southeastern and northern regions of the remnant ( figure  [ fig - fedist ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the hard x - ray emission from the radioactive decay of @xmath2ti has been detected in the interior of the main ejecta shell ( figure  [ fig - fedist ] ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . since @xmath2ti is essentially synthesized in complete si burning with @xmath9-rich freeze - out in the innermost region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath2ti traces `` pure '' @xmath76ni or its stable nuclei @xmath76fe . the majority of the observed @xmath2ti is inside the reverse shock and therefore from unshocked fe ejecta . the inferred mass of the unshocked fe ejecta is @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "such unshocked fe ejecta , however , have not yet been detected , presumably because they are cool ( @xmath77 k ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . instead",
    ", the x - ray - emitting fe ejecta located just outside the @xmath2ti emission was attributed to the corresponding shocked ejecta ( figure  [ fig - fedist ] ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the missing x - ray - emitting fe ejecta toward the south and northeast directions from the explosion center have been puzzling .",
    "we note that the nir [ ] -bright , red portion of the sw shell appears to be in contact with the interior @xmath2ti - emitting region ( figure  [ fig - fedist ] )",
    ". this might be the case for the small red portion near slit 2 in the northeastern shell , too .",
    "therefore , if these [ ] -bright regions are composed of shocked , dense fe ejecta , as implied from our spectroscopic result , it explains why we do not see x - ray - emitting diffuse fe ejecta toward these directions ; the unshocked `` pure '' fe ejecta traced by the radioactive @xmath2ti emission in the interior of the main shell is composed of both dense and diffuse ejecta , and when these are swept up by a reverse shock , we observe either nir [ ]  emission or x - ray emission depending on their densities .",
    "we do not see nir emission associated with the central bright @xmath2ti emission but this could be because the shock is face - on , as suggested by the large red - shifted central velocity ( 11003000 @xmath78 ) of the @xmath2ti line @xcite , or because the reverse shock has not yet reached the dense , unshocked fe ejecta .",
    "recent multi - dimensional simulations show that such global asymmetry in fe ( or @xmath76ni ) density can arise from the low - mode convection of the innermost region just after the core bounce ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "future nir spectral mapping observations revealing the 3d distribution of the dense fe ejecta will be helpful for understanding the sn explosion dynamics of the innermost region .",
    "we have carried out nir spectroscopic observations toward the main ejecta shell of the young snr cas a. in total , 63 individual knots were identified from eight slit positions by using a clump - finding algorithm .",
    "each of these knots has distinct kinematical and spectral properties . within the _ jhk _ spectral range ( 0.942.46 )",
    ", we found 46 emission line features including a dozen bright [ ]  lines , forbidden lines of other metallic species , and h and he lines .",
    "we employed the pca method to classify the knots based on their relative line fluxes into three distinctive groups : he - rich knots of pre - supernova circumstellar wind material , plus s - rich and fe - rich knots of sn ejecta material .",
    "the he - rich and s - rich knots correspond to qsfs and fmks studied in the visible waveband , while fe - rich knots , showing in general only [ ]  emission lines , are likely ` pure ' dense fe ejecta from the innermost layer of the progenitor .",
    "we summarize our main results as follows .",
    "the pca showed that the nir spectral lines can be grouped into three groups : ( 1 ) group 1 , composed of h i  and he i  lines together with [ ]  lines , ( 2 ) group 2 , composed of forbidden lines of si , p , and s , and ( 3 ) group 3 , composed of forbidden fe lines .",
    "the lines in the first two pcs are strongly correlated with each other , while the correlation is rather weak among the forbidden fe lines in group 3 .",
    "these three spectral groups of the emission lines are almost independent in 3d pc space ( figure  [ fig - atr ] ) .",
    "the distribution of the knots in the pc planes matches well with the above spectral groups , and we classified the knots into three groups : ( 1 ) he - rich , ( 2 ) s - rich , and ( 3 ) fe - rich knots .",
    "the knots belonging to these three groups are well separated from each other in f([]-1.03)/f([]-1.644 ) vs. f(he i-1.083)/f([]-1.644 ) plane ( figure  [ fig - fluxratio ] ) , so that one may use these line ratios to classify the knots in cas a. it would be interesting to determine whether this classification methodology applies for other core - collapse snrs .    \\3 .",
    "the he - rich knots show bright emission lines of he i  1.083  and [ ] together with [ ]  and h i  lines .",
    "their line - of - sight speeds are small ( @xmath42 ) . from these chemical and kinematical characteristics ,",
    "we conclude that the he - rich knots are dense csm swept up by the sn blast wave .",
    "these knots correspond to the previously known qsfs .",
    "the s - rich knots show strong forbidden lines of s together with [ ]  and [ ] , and their line - of - sight speeds reach a few 1000 @xmath78 .",
    "these chemical and kinematical properties indicate that the s - rich knots are dense sn ejecta material mostly originating from the o - burning layers and swept up by a reverse shock .",
    "these knots correspond to the fmks detected in previous optical studies .",
    "the fe - rich knots only show strong [ ]  and [ ]  lines , and no or weak he i  1.083  lines . like the s - rich knots",
    ", they have large line - of - sight speeds ( up to @xmath63 ) and broad line widths ( 1035  ) , but they do not show the lines from si , p , and s. some fe - rich knots show he i  1.083   but their fluxes compared to the [ ]  lines are much weaker than those of the he - rich knots .",
    "these spectroscopic properties suggest that the fe - rich knots are most likely `` pure '' dense fe ejecta from the innermost layer of the sn . the comparison of [ ]  1.644  images with the _ hst _ acs / wfc f850lp and f775w and _ nustar _",
    "@xmath2ti images reveals that these fe ejecta are mainly distributed in the sw main ejecta shell , just outside the unshocked @xmath2ti in the interior .",
    "this supports that there could be a large amount of unshocked `` pure '' fe ejecta associated with @xmath2ti .",
    "together with the diffuse , x - ray - emitting `` pure '' fe ejecta detected by _ chandra _ , our result implies that the fe ejecta synthesized in the innermost region develop large - scale non - uniformity during the sn explosion and are expelled asymmetrically .",
