    "one of the outstanding problems in star formation concerns the influence of magnetic fields to the dynamics and timescales ( shu et  al .",
    "1999 ; mckee & ostriker 2007 ) . the relative importance between magnetic fields and turbulence affects cloud evolution and cluster formation ( mckee & ostriker 2007 ) .",
    "ambipolar diffusion has been proposed to regulate core collapse ( shu , adams , & lizano 1987 ) . in",
    "accretion flows , magnetic effects such as magnetic tension , braking , and reconnection , or non - ideal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) effects , can drive the evolution of the formation process ( shu , li , & allen 2004 ; li , mckee , & klein 2011 ) .",
    "the residual magnetic fields in the circumstellar environs further assist to collimate supersonic outflows ( shu et  al .",
    "2000 ; shang , li , & hirano 2007 ) .",
    "intringingly , radio emission with negative spectral index has been reported in a few protostellar jets , e.g. hh80 - 81 ( mart , rodriguez , & reipurth 1993 ; carrasco - gonzalez et  al .",
    "2010 ) , cepheus  a ( garay et  al . 1996 ) , @xmath5 ( reid et  al . 1995 ; wilner , reid , & menten 1999 ) .",
    "such non - thermal emission resembles jets driven by active galactic nuclei and suggests a connection with synchrotron jets .",
    "it has become increasingly clear that dust grains are aligned by magnetic fields not only in the diffuse interstellar medium but also in dense cloud cores or circumstellar disks ( myers & goodman 1991 ; ward - thompson et  al .",

    "; dotson et  al . 2000 , 2010 ) .",
    "although grain alignment mechanisms may be less assured , polarization remains one of the most informative techniques to trace magnetic fields ( lazarian 2007 ) .",
    "complimentary to polarization from selective extinction of background starlight , polarized emission arising from magnetically aligned dust grains in the millimeter or submillimeter wavebands is often used to map the two - dimensional morphology of the three - dimensional ( 3d ) magnetic fields projected on the plane of sky , @xmath6 .",
    "depending on the type of polarization , the observed orientation is supposed to be either parallel to @xmath6 if observed in dust absorption against background sources or perpendicular to @xmath6 if observed in dust thermal emission ( see the review by hildebrand 1988 ) .",
    "the bright ultracompact ( uc )  region , w3(oh ) , marks a nearby ( @xmath7 ; hachisuka et  al . 2006 ) , well - studied massive star - forming region in the course of developing an ob stellar group .",
    "at least seven  regions at different evolutionary stages were found within 30  of w3(oh ) ( harten 1976 ) .",
    "the most recent star formation takes place in a luminous ( @xmath8 ) hot core , @xmath5 ( a.k.a the turner - welch object ) , which is associated with water masers and appears as a warm , dense molecular clump about 6  east to w3(oh ) ( turner & welch 1984 ) . millimeter and submillimeter interferometric studies resolved the dust emission into two components , a and c , and suggest an accreting proto - binary system ( wyrowski et  al .",

    "we perform interferometric polarization observations toward the w3(oh ) massive star - forming region to map the morphology of the projected magnetic fields in this region .",
    "our study is enabled by the submillimeter array(sma ) with its polarimeter system ( marrone et  al .",
    "2006 ; marrone & rao 2008 ) .",
    "observations using quarter - wave plates installed on the sma were carried out with seven antennas in the extended configuration on 2007 august  10 and with six antennas in the compact configuration on 2008 september  20 .",
    "the phase tracking center is at @xmath10(j2000 ) = @xmath11 .",
    "the system temperature varied from 150 to 580  k during the extended array observation and from 110 to 400  k during the compact array observation .",
    "the correlator was set to have a spectral resolution of @xmath12 , corresponding to @xmath13 , and 2  ghz bandwidth in each sideband .",
    "the projected baselines have a range of @xmath14 , which is insensitive to structures larger than 11  ( wilner & welch 1994 ) . the full - width at half power ( fwhp ) of the primary beam is roughly 37",
    ".    data inspection , calibration , and imaging were performed with the miriad package .",
    "the instrumental polarization response , i.e. `` leakage , '' for each antenna was calibrated by observing strong quasars , 3c111 and 3c454.3 , over a wide hour angle range for a good parallactic angle coverage .",
    "the bandpass calibration was performed with 3c454.3 .",
    "ganymede and callisto were used to set the flux density scale , which is estimated to be accurate within 15% .",
    "regularly interleaved observations of the nearby quasar 3c84 were conducted to monitor the atmospheric variations .",
    "atmospheric complex gains were first solved with respect to 3c84 to make initial stokes @xmath15 images for individual tracks .",
    "the gain solutions were further improved by one iteration of phase - only self - calibration using the initial stokes @xmath15 images as models . to image continuum emission ,",
    "care has been taken to remove channels with line emission .",
    "both sidebands were used to generate line - free continuum maps in a multi - frequency synthesis with an effective central frequency of @xmath16 .    to obtain the best signal - to - noise ratio , maps of stokes @xmath15 ( total intensity ) , and stokes @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( linear polarization ) were made with visibilities weighted by the associated system temperature using natural weighting .",
    "this results in a synthesized beam of @xmath19 with position angle ( p.a . ) of @xmath20 . for easy comprehension and convenience of subsequent nyquist sampling ,",
    "we smooth all the maps with a circular gaussian beam of @xmath21 .",
    "the resultant maps have an rms noise level of @xmath22 for the stokes @xmath15 map and @xmath23 for maps of stokes @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    ". the dynamic range of the stokes @xmath15 map is limited at a maximum intensity value of @xmath24 due to the @xmath25-@xmath26 coverage and calibration accuracy .",
    "once stokes @xmath15 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are known , the polarization percentage , @xmath27 , and the polarization position angle , @xmath28 , can be deduced ( matthews & wilson 2000 ) . the raw polarized intensity , @xmath29 , is necessarily positive and biased by the rms noise of stokes @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath30 .",
    "hence , a debiased polarized intensity is used , @xmath31 ( leahy 1989 ; vaillancourt 2006 ) when computing the polarization percentage , @xmath32 .",
    "the polarization position angle is determined by @xmath33 , with an uncertainty of @xmath34 .",
    "note that in linear polarization measurements , values of @xmath35 different by @xmath36 are identical .",
    "after generating maps of stokes @xmath15 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , we image the distribution of polarization , including @xmath37 , @xmath27 , and @xmath35 , for regions where @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",

    "both the w3(h@xmath2o ) hot core and the w3(oh ) uc  region are clearly detected in the stokes @xmath15 map .",
    "polarization is detected in w3(h@xmath2o ) , w3(oh ) , and their vicinity , particularly in a faint , extended component in the north - west of w3(h@xmath2o ) . in the w3(oh ) uc  region , the total intensity is dominated by the free - free continuum , which is supposed to be unpolarized .",
    "additional care is needed to estimate the relative contributions from dust and free - free emission to the total intensity in w3(oh ) , and this will be discussed elsewhere .      in table",
    "[ tpol ] , we group the detected polarization values based on their apparent association with distinct polarization subregions : w3(h@xmath2o ) , w3(h@xmath2o)-nw referring to the extended structure in the north - west of w3(h@xmath2o ) , w3(h@xmath2o)-e and w3(h@xmath2o)-w referring to the two small regions in the east and west of w3(h@xmath2o ) , respectively . with the exception of w3(h@xmath2o)-nw , there is a general east - west orientation of @xmath6 across the whole region ( figure  [ fvla ] ) .    in w3(h@xmath2o ) , the polarization orientation is remarkably uniform , @xmath40 .",
    "the mean polarization angle weighted by observational uncertainty is @xmath41 .",
    "we compute the standard deviation , @xmath42 , with respect to @xmath43 and obtain a value of @xmath44 ( table  [ tb ] ) .",
    "this observed dispersion , @xmath42 , includes the measurement uncertainty , which is the root mean square ( rms ) , @xmath45 , of the observed uncertainties , @xmath46 .",
    "hence , the intrinsic dispersion of polarization angle is given by @xmath47 and will be used to estimate the magnetic field strength of @xmath6 ( sect .",
    "[ sec_jet ] ) .",
    "in addition , the distribution of polarization angle in w3(h@xmath2o)-nw ( figure  [ fpol ] ) also appears fairly uniform .",
    "we compute for w3(h@xmath2o)-nw a mean polarization angle of @xmath48 and an intrinsic polarization angle dispersion of @xmath49 .",
    "the synchrotron jet exhibits a double - sided morphology along the east - west direction centered at the millimeter continuum peak w3(h@xmath2o)a in the vla 3.6  cm map ( figure  [ fvla ] ; wilner et  al .",
    "our uncertainty weighted mean polarization angle of @xmath41 implies an east - west orientation of @xmath6 , in good agreement with the direction of the synchrotron jet . in early vla studies of the synchrotron jet ( reid et  al .",
    "1995 ; wilner et  al .",
    "1999 ) , an inhomogeneous model of a biconical geometry with opening angle of 0.1  rad successfully reproduced the observed properties .",
    "the model gave a total magnetic field strength of @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the angular distance from the center .",
    "the field strength of the projected magnetic field component , @xmath6 , can be estimated if the dispersion of the polarization angle , @xmath52 , the mass density , @xmath53 , and the velocity dispersion along line of sight , @xmath54 , are measured . considering a uniform magnetic field , chandrasekhar & fermi ( 1953",
    "; hereafter cf ) first proposed a `` polarization - dispersion '' method to estimate @xmath6 based on transverse motions of alfvn waves , which are observable as dispersion in polarization angles , @xmath52 , from the mean orientation of the projected fields .",
    "if the velocity dispersion is isotropic and the transverse velocity dispersion is equal to @xmath54 , one can obtain the plane - of - sky magnetic field strength @xmath55 where @xmath56 corresponds to the original cf formula , and @xmath57 is the mean molecular weight . in a later study , ostriker , stone , & gammie ( 2001 )",
    "performed 3d numerical mhd simulations with conditions in turbulent clouds and suggested a factor of @xmath58 applicable at varying observer orientations as long as @xmath59 .",
    "chen et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) have studied the physical conditions in @xmath5 by analyzing the 1.4  mm and 2.8  mm continuum and the @xmath60 lines . since our polarization observations",
    "do not resolve individual protostellar envelopes , we simply take their mean value of @xmath61 and @xmath62 based on the @xmath60 spectra . using equation  ( [ eqb ] ) , we estimate the magnetic field strength to be @xmath63 . since @xmath42 can be lowered by the finite angular resolution and averaging along line of sight , this estimate of @xmath6 should be considered as an upper limit .",
    "when zeeman measurements are available to provide the line - of - sight magnetic field strength , @xmath64 , it is possible to evaluate the total field strength with @xmath65 .",
    "this offers an independent method to estimate the total field strength in comparison with the synchrotron model .",
    "the zeeman measurements in @xmath66 @xmath67 masers in w3(h@xmath2o ) yield a postshock field strength of @xmath68 ( sarma et  al .",
    "2002 ) . depending on the degree of shock compression , the field could be amplified by a factor of about @xmath69 ( sarma et  al .",
    "2002 ) and renders an estimate for the preshock field strength of @xmath70 .",
    "hence , an estimate of the total field strength is about @xmath71 , with orientation close to the plane of sky .",
    "though slightly higher , this total field strength is comparable to the value given by the synchrotron model ( reid et  al . 1995 ; wilner et  al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "following crutcher ( 1999 ) , we estimate the observed - to - critical mass - to - magnetic flux ratio , @xmath72 , for w3(h@xmath2o ) with @xmath73 ( chen et  al .",
    "this implies the core is magnetically subcritical and can be supported by the static magnetic field against the gravitational collapse .",
    "however , ongoing collapse in this region has been suggested by infall asymmetry in spectral profiles ( wu & evans 2003 ; wu et  al .",
    "since interferometric observations tend to underestimate column density and @xmath6 is an upper limit , our estimate of @xmath74 should be treated as a lower limit . using the total field strength ,",
    "the alvn velocity is given by @xmath75 .",
    "the ratio of the turbulent to magnetic energy can be evaluated with @xmath76 , implying that the magnetic energy dominates over turbulence in this hot core ( girart et  al .",
    "unlike the hot core , there are very limited observations addressing the extended structure w3(h@xmath2o)-nw .",
    "we are not able to estimate the field strength for @xmath6 at the moment .",
    "the mean polarization angle of @xmath48 in this extended structure appears quite different from the general north - south polarization orientation and implies @xmath6 to be at @xmath77 .",
    "based on its morphology and relative position with w3(oh ) and the northern  region ( figure  [ fvla ] ) , we speculate that w3(h@xmath2o)-nw could be residual matter being pushed by the expansion of the northern  region and the champagne flow from w3(oh ) .",
    "our polarization measurements show a decrease of polarization percentage , @xmath27 , toward regions of higher intensity , @xmath15 , ( figure  [ fpolm]a , black dots ) .",
    "to avoid complication caused by the uc  region , we exclude polarization measurements in w3(oh ) . assuming a power - law dependence , we obtain a relationship of @xmath78 with a reduced chi - square of @xmath79 .",
    "this `` depolarization '' phenomenon has been reported in many regions , e.g. l1755 ( lazarian et  al . 1997 ) , orion - kl ( rao et  al . 1998 ) , omc-3 ( matthews , wilson , & fiege 2001 ) , w51 ( lai , girart , & crutcher 2003 ; tang et  al . 2009b ) , g5.89@xmath800.39 ( tang et  al .",
    "the reduction of polarization may be due to complexity of magnetic field geometry ( matthews et  al . 2001 ) , decreasing dust alignment efficiency ( lazarian et  al .",
    "1997 ) , beam smearing over small - scale structures ( rao et  al .",
    "1998 ) , and integration of varying magnetic domains along the line of sight .",
    "the sma polarization measurements nicely fill in the central polarization `` hole '' in the larger scale @xmath81 polarization map from the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) of matthews et  al .",
    "the three innermost jcmt measurements sit around the edge of the @xmath82 sma field of view .",
    "in addition , the jcmt measurements with an angular resolution of @xmath83 also show the depolarization effect ( figure  [ fpolm]a ; gray triangles ) . despite the great difference in angular resolutions and map extents between the sma and jcmt observations , the jcmt measurements yield a similar relationship of @xmath84 with @xmath85 . to understand this similarity",
    ", we convert the dust intensity to column density with assumptions of a gas - to - dust mass ratio of @xmath86 , a dust opacity of @xmath87 ( hildebrand 1983 ) , and a dust temperature of @xmath69 and @xmath88 for the jcmt and sma measurements , respectively ( wilson , gaume , & johnston 1993 ; wink et  al .",
    "for the central region , we derived @xmath89 by comparing the flux density between @xmath90 ( chen et  al .",
    "2006 ) and @xmath0 in maps made with visibilities of projected baselines within @xmath91 , the range that the two frequencies have in common .",
    "such small @xmath92 is often attributed to grain growth in high - density environment ( miyake & nakagawa 1993 ) and is not valid in the outer region . to convert the jcmt measurements , we adopt @xmath93 for active protostellar cores ( rathborne et  al .",
    "2010 ) . in figure  [ fpolm]b , the polarization percentage shows a similar dependence with the beam averaged column density between the two populations of polarization measurements ( figure  [ fpolm]b ) .",
    "a fit using all the data gives @xmath94 with @xmath95 .",
    "we suggest that the column density may be an important factor when interpreting the depolarization effects caused by decreasing alignment efficiency , beam smearing , and integration along line of sight .",
    "we present the first interferometric polarization map in the w3(oh ) massive star - forming region observed with the sma at @xmath0 with an angular resolution of 15 , corresponding to @xmath1 .",
    "the main findings are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the magnetic field orientation is well aligned with the synchrotron jet in w3(h@xmath2o ) and is close to the plane of sky with @xmath63 .",
    "the total field strength is estimated to be @xmath4 , slightly higher but comparable to the estimate of @xmath96 from the synchrotron model .",
    "the magnetic energy dominates over turbulence in the hot core .",
