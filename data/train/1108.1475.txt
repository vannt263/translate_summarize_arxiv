    "qubit is the basic information unit of quantum computer .",
    "hence , the generation of multi - qubit entangled states keeps as an essential task in quantum information processing and transmission @xcite .",
    "quantum entanglement , especially multipartite entanglement , has many important applications , such as measurement - based quantum computing @xcite , secure superdense coding @xcite , teleportation @xcite , entanglement purification @xcite and quantum cryptography @xcite .",
    "however , the experimental realization of multipartite entanglement is still a significant challenge .",
    "people realized that the manipulation of more than six photons without quantum storage turns out to be an insurmountable obstacle with present technology @xcite .",
    "however , the hyperentanglement(he ) , which in practice remains in many physical systems , tends to be an effective and practical way @xcite to manipulate more qubits effectively , namely making the quanta , e.g. photons , to be entangled simultaneously in multiple degrees of freedom ( dofs ) .",
    "furthermore , he states are much less affected by decoherence and are particular important in the realization of even more challenging objectives in comparison with the normal entangled states .",
    "recently , two - photon four - qubit states @xcite and two - photon six - qubit states @xcite were experimentally realized , and found to offer significant enhancement of the channel capacity in superdense coding @xcite , to construct efficiently the fourqubit two - photon cluster states @xcite , and to realize successfully the basic quantum computation algorithms in the one - way model @xcite .",
    "more recently , jian - wei pan _",
    "generated in experiment the hyperentangled ten - qubit photonic schrdinger cat state by exploiting polarization and momentum of five photons @xcite . in this article , we propose an experimentally practical scheme for generating a four - photon twelve - qubit hyperentangled state entangled in three dofs , i.e. in polarization , frequency and spatial mode .",
    "nonlocality is a unique feature of quantum mechanics(qm ) differing from the local realism(lr ) theory .",
    "people found that the he states can enhance the violation of lr @xcite .",
    "we find in this work that the twelve - qubit hyperentangled state exhibits extremely large violation of the lr constraint by evaluating a bell - type inequality .",
    "furthermore , we show generally that the more the entangled degrees of freedom are , the stronger the violation of bell - type inequality will be    the structure of the paper goes as follows : in section 2 , an experimentally feasible scheme for the production and measurement of a four - photon twelve - qubit hyperentangled state is proposed . in section 3 , we discuss the quantum characteristics of the hyperentangled state(mathematic details are presented in appendix ) . a brief summary and concluding remarks are given in section 4 .",
    "the hyperentangled state to be generated in our scheme takes the following form up to a normalization constant : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote horizontal and vertical polarization , @xmath3 and @xmath4 signify different frequency and @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 label eight different spatial modes .",
    "the state ( [ shi1 ] ) shows maximal entanglement among all photons degrees of freedom in polarization , frequency and spatial modes . this state is a schringer cat state , and",
    "can also be called as greenberger - horne - zeilinger state @xcite , which possesses peculiar interest in quantum information science .    to generate the state",
    ", the first step is to produce two pairs of two - dimensional hyperentangled photons , as shown in figure [ fig1]a , via two adjacent thin type - ii barium borate ( bbo ) crystals @xcite . the photon pairs can be generated by spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) @xcite and entangled in polarization and frequency dofs @xcite .",
    "if pump photon downconvert in first ( second ) crystal , the frequency of the signal photon will be @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , and hence the idler photon takes the opposite . in case a pump pulse coming from left ( right ) threads the first ( second ) set of crystal , a pair of photons will be produced in the spatial modes @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) .",
    "similarly , a pair of hyperentangled photons can be produced in spatial modes @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) @xcite while the pump pulse is reflected by the mirror behind the crystal and then threads the crystal second time .",
    "since one can simply adjust the relative phase between the first and second possibilities , two pairs of photons in the following form are readily obtained : @xmath21 @xmath22    next , we employ the two non - entangled photons @xmath23 and @xmath24 in above two pairs to make all photons entangled in polarization and spatial mode . obviously , photons @xmath23 and @xmath24 are in the state of the form @xmath25\\bigotimes [ ( |h\\rangle+|v\\rangle)\\bigotimes ( |c_{1}\\rangle+|c_{2}\\rangle)]\\ ; .\\label{shi4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as shown in figure [ fig1]b , photons in paths @xmath13 and @xmath15 ( @xmath17 and @xmath19 ) frontally enter polarizing beam splitters ( pbss ) .",
    "since the pbs transmits h and reflects v polarization photons , we can then come to a conclusion that if the two photons pass through paths @xmath5 and @xmath7 ( @xmath9 and @xmath11 ) simultaneously , it implies that both of the photons are h or v polarized .",
    "afterwards , photons in modes @xmath5 , @xmath7 , @xmath9 and @xmath11 are led to a cross - kerr nonlinear medium @xcite as shown in figure [ fig2 ] , which brings forth an adjustable phase shift to the coherent state @xmath26 through cross - phase modulation ( xpm ) , e.g. @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 for four modes , respectively .",
    "then we perform the @xmath31 homodyne detection on the coherent state @xmath26 @xcite . in case",
    "the measured phase shift is @xmath32 , the state will be kept . in the end , the reserved states of photons @xmath23 and @xmath24 can only come out from @xmath5 and @xmath7 or @xmath9 and @xmath11 .",
    "that means the states of photons @xmath23 and @xmath24 are in the following entangled form : @xmath33    similarly , we can use another pair of non - entangled photons @xmath34 and @xmath35 to make all photons entangled in spacial mode and frequency . as mentioned in above , the initial photons @xmath34 and @xmath35 are in the state : @xmath36\\bigotimes [ ( |\\omega_{1}\\rangle+|\\omega_{2}\\rangle)\\bigotimes ( |d_1\\rangle+|d_2\\rangle)]\\ ; .\\label{shi6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] connecting paths @xmath14 , @xmath18 , @xmath16 and @xmath20 with four optical demultiplexers ( od ) respectively , which are part of wavelength division multiplex ( wdm ) @xcite , we then separate each mode into two in terms of frequency as shown in figure [ fig1]c . the modes",
    "@xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 correspond to frequency @xmath3 , while the modes @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 correspond to @xmath4 .",
    "taking the same procedure as for modes a and c , we lead these eight paths to another cross - kerr nonlinear medium , as shown figure [ fig3 ] , which induces the coherent state @xmath45 phase shifts of @xmath29 , @xmath46 , @xmath30 , @xmath47 , @xmath27 , @xmath48 , @xmath28 and @xmath49 , respectively . after performing the @xmath50 homodyne detection on @xmath45 , we retain those states with phase shift @xmath32 .",
    "then , photons @xmath34 and @xmath35 should pass through in one pair of the four paths , i.e. @xmath37-@xmath39 , @xmath41-@xmath43 , @xmath38-@xmath40 , and @xmath42-@xmath44 . at",
    "last , let those two paths originated from the same path via od link to an optical multiplexer(om ) , which is other part of wdm and can merge them into one path .",
    "for instance , paths @xmath37-@xmath41 , which both come from @xmath14 by od , are merged into @xmath6 after passing through om . after taking above procedures ,",
    "photons @xmath34 and @xmath35 then lie in the state of the following entangled form : @xmath51    in all , from ( [ shi2 ] ) , ( [ shi3 ] ) , ( [ shi5 ] ) and ( [ shi7 ] ) , we find that a four - photon 12-qubit hyperentangled state ( [ shi1 ] ) is created .",
    "unfortunately , the setups shown in figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] are generally impossible to change the sign of the phase shift in single nonlinear medium .",
    "the signs of the phase shifts must be identical , since they are all proportional to the nonlinear susceptibility @xmath52 @xcite . to circumvent this difficulty , at least one can use either the cross - kerr with two materials of opposite nonlinearities instead of the single material , or use double xpm method @xcite without minus phase as shown in figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] . in figure [ fig4 ]",
    ", we use a 50:50 beam splitter ( bs ) to divide the coherent state into two beams @xmath26 @xmath26 , and then they are coupled to the photonic modes @xmath5 and @xmath9 , @xmath7 and @xmath11 through the xpm respectively . correspondingly , the phase shifts induced by the couplings are @xmath32 and @xmath29 in both beams . afterwards ,",
    "the two coherent states after the interaction are compared with a 50 - 50 bs .",
    "project the @xmath53@xmath54 onto the upper beam , in case @xmath55 , the state ( [ shi5 ] ) is obtained .",
    "analogously , we can obtain the state ( [ shi7 ] ) with the same procedure as presented in figure [ fig5 ] .    a setup for measuring the hyperentanglement in polarization , frequency and spatial mode",
    "simultaneously and independently is schematically shown in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "place eight of these setups in all eight output paths , the qubits in spatial mode can then be determined . of each spatial mode , the optical demultiplexer splits it into two paths according to frequency , which means one therefore obtains the qubits in frequency .",
    "subsequently , at both of these two paths the conventional polarization analysis @xcite is implemented , by which the qubits in polarization are read out .",
    "to characterize the hyperentangled state ( [ shi1 ] ) , we evaluate the bell - type inequality violation of it .",
    "note that the 12-qubit state ( [ shi1 ] ) is the eigenstate of @xmath56 stabilizing operators with unit eigenvalue @xcite .",
    "i.e. , @xmath57 where @xmath58 describe perfect correlations in the state . here ,",
    "@xmath59@xmath60\\{@xmath61 , @xmath62@xmath63 , @xmath62@xmath64 , @xmath62@xmath65 } represent the observables for each photon . @xmath61 and @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65",
    "denote the identity and pauli matrices , with subscript @xmath66 signifying photons @xmath67 and @xmath35 , and superscript @xmath68 signifying the three dof .",
    "the operators @xmath31 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 satisfy relationship @xmath71 .    according to ref.@xcite",
    "the bell operator can be expressed as @xmath72 the local hidden variable theory(lhvt ) sets the upper bound for the expectation value of @xmath73 , and hence satisfies the following inequality @xcite @xmath74 we notice that among all 4096 @xmath75 , there are 1854 of them with negative signs in front as shown in the appendix , like @xmath76    in lhvt , the observables are elements of reality , that means their values are precisely defined , i.e. either @xmath77 or @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the upper bound of the expectation value of @xmath73 in ( [ shi10 ] ) is @xmath79 . on the other hand , in quantum mechanics ,",
    "the expectation value of @xmath73 is @xmath80 .",
    "obviously , the qm result greatly violates the inequality ( [ shi11 ] ) , the bound set by the lhvt .",
    "following , we compare the degrees of violation of different ghz - type states with same amount of qubits but different numbers of photons . according to the appendix",
    ", one may conclude that the more the entangled degrees of freedom are , the stronger the violation of bell - type inequality will be . to give a concrete example , in table [ table1 ] we compare the violation degrees to the bell - type inequality of three different 12-qubit entangled states , that is ( [ shi1 ] ) , @xmath81 and @xmath82",
    "the results in the table indicate that the state ( [ shi1 ] ) entangled in three dofs violates the bell inequality ( [ shi11 ] ) most , the state ( [ shi-2 ] ) entangled in two dofs goes next , and the state ( [ shi-3 ] ) entangled in only one dof violates the bell inequality least .",
    "in summary , in this work we propose a novel scheme for the generation of simultaneous entanglement of four photons in three independent dofs , i.e. , a 12-qubit hyperentangled state , by virtue of the linear optical instrument and cross - kerr nonlinearity .",
    "we show that the proposed scheme is within the reach of nowadays technology .",
    "theoretically , our method can be simply expanded to the production of hyperentangled state with more photons , although practically the difficulties in the manipulation of six or more photons make the expansion non - realistic . to check the nonlocality nature of this 12-qubit hyperentangled state",
    ", we evaluate its violation degree to a bell - type inequality .",
    "the result agrees well with the qm prediction while extremely contradicts to the lr constraint , which indicates that the genuine multiparticle hyperentangled state possesses certain superiority in comparison with the normal entangled state in the verification of qm nonlocality , quantum computation , and quantum information processing .",
    "this work was supported in part by the national natural science foundation of china(nsfc ) , by the cas key projects kjcx2-yw - n29 and h92a0200s2 .",

    "according to the method in calculating the state ( [ shi1 ] ) in the text , we just need to calculate the number of @xmath75 with negative sign , labeled as @xmath95 .",
    "the larger @xmath95 means a bigger violation .",
