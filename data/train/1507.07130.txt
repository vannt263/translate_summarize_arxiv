    "one of the most important properties of vapor - liquid equilibria that can be determined by molecular simulation , is the surface tension @xcite .",
    "usually , the properties of interfaces are directly sampled in a simulation volume containing both the vapor and the liquid phase , separated by an interface . indirect methods like grand equilibrium @xcite , @xmath0 plus test particle @xcite or gibbs ensemble @xcite",
    "provide access to the bulk properties along the saturation curve in a numerically more efficient manner but do not consider interfaces .",
    "intermolecular interactions are usually evaluated explicitly up to a specified cutoff radius , beyond which the interactions are covered by a mean field approach , i.e. a long range correction ( lrc ) which compensates for the cutoff @xcite . in homogeneous simulations ,",
    "the lrc typically only considers the energy and the virial @xcite , while in inhomogeneous systems also the force has to be corrected appropriately @xcite .",
    "if a small cutoff radius is used without a lrc , the surface tension and other thermodynamic properties are known to deviate significantly from the correct values @xcite .    for homogeneous systems , typical correction strategies",
    "are straightforward , making the approximation that the pair correlation function is unity beyond the cutoff radius",
    ". they may rely on a site - site correction @xcite or on center - of - mass correction approaches , employing angle averaging @xcite or the reaction field method @xcite .",
    "for inhomogeneous configurations , fast multipole methods @xcite , slab based lrc @xcite or more complex ewald summation techniques are used @xcite .",
    "recent implementations of the slab based lrc and the ewald summation technique yield very similar results for planar interfaces @xcite .",
    "in addition to the lrc approach , the cutoff scheme plays an important role . for molecular models consisting of several interaction sites ,",
    "the computational effort is much smaller for a center - of - mass cutoff compared to a site - site cutoff .",
    "this advantage rises with the number of sites .",
    "however , the lrc has to be consistent with the chosen scheme @xcite .",
    "a site - site cutoff scheme consumes a much larger amount of computing time , because every site - site distance has to be evaluated and compared to the cutoff radius .",
    "e.g. , for a pair of carbon dioxide models consisting of three lennard - jones sites each , the site - site cutoff scheme requires the execution of nine distance calculations and @xmath1 statements for the lennard - jones interactions during the neighborhood search , while a center - of - mass cutoff requires only one .",
    "hence , a center - of - mass cutoff scheme should be preferred .    in the present work ,",
    "we combine the slab based lrc approach for inhomogeneous systems by janeek @xcite with the center - of - mass cutoff method by lustig @xcite , which is based on angle averaging , and apply it to molecular models containing several lennard - jones sites .",
    "this combined correction approach is validated for planar interfaces with a two - center lennard - jones model fluid and two fluid models representing carbon dioxide and cyclohexane .",
    "the intermolecular pair potential @xmath2 is usually evaluated in molecular simulation explicitly only up to a specified cutoff radius @xmath3 . to correct for the error made by this approximation",
    ", a lrc has to be applied .",
    "the potential energy of molecule @xmath4 is thus separated into the explicitly computed contribution and the lrc contribution @xmath5 for systems with planar symmetry , such as a planar liquid film surrounded by vapor , it is sufficient to compute the lrc in terms of the coordinate normal to the interface , employing a slab - based approach @xcite . in the present work , this corresponds to the @xmath6 direction .",
    "the correction term @xmath7 is then a sum over all @xmath8 slabs with respect to the interactions @xmath9 between the molecule @xmath4 and the molecules in slab @xmath10 @xmath11 according to janeek @xcite , the correction term @xmath12 is an integral over the slab volume @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the mean density in slab @xmath10 and @xmath15 is the slab thickness , cf .",
    "figure [ fig : lrc ] . as usual , it was assumed by janeek @xcite that for the radial distribution function within a single slab @xmath16 @xmath17 1 holds beyond the cutoff radius .",
    "according to siperstein , the lower bound of the integration @xmath18 has to be selected appropriately @xcite as shown in figure [ fig : lrc ] . if the distance @xmath19 between the molecule @xmath4 and the slab @xmath10 is smaller than the cutoff radius , the cutoff radius has to be used as the lower integration bound , otherwise it is @xmath20 @xcite , i.e. @xmath21 this definition of @xmath18 has to be employed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : janecek ] ) as well as the analogous expressions for the force and the virial .     between the molecule @xmath4 and the slab @xmath10 is smaller than the cutoff radius",
    ", the cutoff radius has to be used as the lower integration bound , cf .",
    "( [ eq : janecek ] ) and ( [ eq : rc ] ) . ]",
    "janeek s approach yields results that are hardly dependent on the cutoff radius for the single - site lennard - jones fluid down to @xmath22 @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "it is also suitable for multi - site models if the molecular simulation code is based on a site - site cutoff scheme .",
    "however , for molecules consisting of several lennard - jones sites , a center - of - mass cutoff scheme is more efficient because only the distances between the centers of mass have to be evaluated during the neighborhood search . in this case ,",
    "angle averaging as proposed by lustig @xcite is required for the lrc , because the orientation of the molecules can not be considered explicitly by the lrc .",
    "the present study introduces such an approach , applying it to the lennard - jones potential @xmath24 , \\label{eq : lj}\\ ] ] with the energy parameter @xmath25 and the size parameter @xmath23 , where @xmath26 represents the distance between the interaction sites , which may deviate from the distance between the centers of mass @xmath27 .",

    "figure [ fig : angleaveraging ] . for a given @xmath27 , the center - center ( cc ) , center - site ( cs ) and site - site ( ss ) distances depend on the mutual orientation of the molecules .",
    "the term @xmath26 thus has to be an average over all molecular orientations with the same center - of - mass distance @xmath27 @xcite .    .",
    "the dots indicate the center of mass , while the crosses denote the site positions . ]      in the cc case , i.e. , for the interaction between lennard - jones sites in the center of mass , the distance @xmath26 is equal to the center - of - mass distance @xmath27 and no angle averaging is required , because @xmath28 .",
    "for the cc case , the reader is referred to janeek @xcite , who derived correction terms for the potential energy , virial and force .",
    "the present work generalizes janeek s approach such that a center - of - mass cutoff scheme can be applied to cs and ss interactions with a similar accuracy .      in the cs case , a site is not in the center of mass of its molecule , i.e. it is situated at a distance @xmath29 from the center of mass .",
    "the cs case does not exist on its own , because cc and ss interactions are also always present in such a scenario .",
