    "plane electric current distributions and magnetic fields produced by them are of great interest in a number of applications , for instance , when investigating magnetic flux pinning and critical states in thin superconductor films .",
    "at given current , one can calculate its field anywhere by direct integration .",
    "but in practice the inverse problem arises : how one could extract the current from measuring orthogonal ( normal to plane ) component of its field in some film s neighborhood , e.g. at its surface ?",
    "although this is standard problem of the classical theory of potential , i did not find its solution in textbooks .",
    "therefore i ventured to derive it independently , for special case of axial symmetry .",
    "let a film with radius @xmath0 and small thickness @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) lies in the @xmath3-plane ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) and carries a circular current whose density integrated over the thickness is @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that in fact we know not @xmath6 itself but normal component of its magnetic field close to the film s surface , @xmath7 . in case of superconductor film ,",
    "this quantity represents density of vortices which pierce the film . from known @xmath8",
    "we want to obtain tangential radial component of same field , @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "if the latter is known , then the integral surface current density @xmath11 @xmath12 ( with @xmath13 being azimuth current density ) can be found with the help of relation @xmath14 @xmath15 which follows from the maxwell equation  * curl*@xmath16 ( written in the cgse units ) .    outside the film",
    ", the field has potential character , @xmath17 , with a potential @xmath18 satisfying the laplace equation @xmath19 .",
    "with reference to circular geometry , it is natural to consider the potential @xmath18 using the spheroidal coordinates",
    ". their definition and examples of there application can be found e.g. in @xcite .",
    "we use slightly modified version of spheroidal coordinates , in the form @xmath20 at that the horizontal angle stays the third coordinate : @xmath21 , @xmath22 . to write the laplace operator , @xmath23 , in these coordinates",
    ", it is convenient to introduce two operators @xmath24 then @xmath23 looks as @xmath25+\\,\\frac { 1}{\\rho^2}\\,\\frac { \\partial^2 } { \\partial \\phi^2}\\,\\ , , \\label{laplace}\\ ] ] the film occupies the region @xmath26 , @xmath27 , which corresponds to @xmath28 , while the rest of the plane @xmath29 to @xmath30 . of course",
    ", the potential must be anti - symmetric with respect to this plane , therefore , @xmath31 at film s surface the potential has discontinuity , but its normal derivative is continuous . by the terms of our task ,",

    "formally , the problem @xmath19 with boundary conditions ( [ zero ] ) and ( [ bc ] ) is equivalent to the problem about electric potential of a charge distributed , with density @xmath35 , in the circular hole @xmath36 cut out of ideally conducting plane @xmath37 .",
    "if the axial symmetry is assumed , then the laplace equation reduces to @xmath38",
    "the operator @xmath39 in ( [ le ] ) is nothing but generating operator for the complete set of orthogonal ( at interval @xmath40 ) legendre polynomials @xmath41 ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath42 therefore , particular solutions to eq.[le ] have the form @xmath43 , where functions @xmath44 satisfy the equation @xmath45 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath46 @xmath47 .",
    "consequently , @xmath48 , with @xmath49 also being solutions of eq.[lp ] : @xmath50 .",
    "that must be chosen be the second kind ( non - polynomial ) eigenfunctions which have zero asymptotic at infinity , because @xmath51 should tend to zero at @xmath52 . hence , according to general theory of classical special functions @xcite , @xmath44 can be represented by @xmath53    in view of the boundary condition ( [ zero ] ) , as well as ( [ bc ] ) , the odd polynomials with @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) only contribute to complete solution of eq.[le ] . by this reason , we can write @xmath56 with coefficients @xmath57 to be determined from condition ( [ bc ] ) . notice @xcite that @xmath58 form complete orthogonal set in the half - interval @xmath59 . under standard classical definition of legendre polynomials ,",
    "@xmath60 that is @xmath61 in ( [ exp ] ) serves as normalizing multiplier .",
    "the result of subsequent proper calculations ( detailed in appendix in sec.1 ) reads @xmath62 here the quantities @xmath63 are introduced . at upper side of film s surface , formulas ( [ exp ] ) and ( [ coefs ] ) , as combined with ( [ ss ] ) and ( [ sc ] ) , yield ( see appendix 2 ) @xmath64 where the green function @xmath65 is presented by    @xmath66    @xmath67\\,= \\label{sum}\\ ] ]    @xmath68\\,\\,\\ , , \\label{tr}\\ ] ]    where @xmath69 is the first - kind elliptic integral and @xmath70 the first - kind complete elliptic integral .",
    "the way of summation of the series ( [ series ] ) is described in sec.3 of appendix .",
    "provided the normal field at surface of ( infinitely ) thin film is known , the current can be restored by means of ( [ j ] ) and ( [ sp ] ) : @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "integration of ( [ curr ] ) yields the mean current : @xmath73 it is easy to calculate also the magnetic moment , @xmath74 , of the current  @xcite : @xmath75 thus both these characteristics eliminate contributions from the film s edge , i.e. @xmath76 .    the expansion ( [ sum ] ) , when substituted to ( [ curr ] ) , determines `` natural modes '' of the surface field : @xmath77 clearly , @xmath78 is @xmath79-order polynomial , and @xmath80 ( because @xmath81 ) , while @xmath82 is polynomial of the same order multiplied by factor @xmath83 and possesses square - root divergency at film s edge .",

    ", one can form linear combinations of these modes without current s divergency at the edge .",
    "for example , the two lowest modes ( @xmath89 ) give @xmath90 with @xmath91 .    the approach mentioned in appendix 3",

    "to resume , we found how to determine an electric current distribution in thin circular film from normal component of the current - induced field measured in the vicinity of film s surface ( very similar task about infinite strip film must be considered separately ) .",
