    "in the recent years , there has been a flurry of activity about the use of red clump stars as a distance indicator .",
    "several authors provided examples of distances determinations with the rc method to the magellanic clouds , the galactic center , the carina dwarf galaxy and m31 ( e.g. paczyski & stanek 1998 ; stanek et al . 1998 ; stanek & garnavich 1998 ; udalski 1998 , udalski 2000 ) .",
    "there are several strong arguments in favor of this method .",
    "first , the red clump is easy to recognize in the color - magnitude diagram and this feature is little affected by other structures in the cmd ( like the horizontal branch , the red giant branch or foreground contamination ) .",
    "second , there are many red clump stars in a typical galaxy or cluster , this renders the method statistically robust .",
    "third , it is one of very few distance indicators that can potentially be accurately calibrated , with several hundreds of stars having hipparcos parallaxes better than 10% @xcite .",
    "however , there are complications . several authors ( girardi et al .",
    "1998 ; girardi 1999 ; cole 1998 ) presented arguments , mostly theoretical , that the average magnitude of the red clump is sensitive to age and metallicity and thus , a detailed knowledge of the average age and metal content of a galaxy are needed before using the rc method to determine distances .",
    "the debate has been heated by the fact that the advocates of the rc method found very short distances to the magellanic clouds , e.g. @xmath1 in @xcite and @xmath2 in @xcite , later revised upwards to @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the reddening correction in the lmc may also be a source of disagreement since the average red clump magnitude measured by different groups  using different methods to correct for extinction  are markedly different [ @xmath4 in @xcite , @xmath5 in @xcite , @xmath6 in @xcite ] .",
    "most recently , @xcite and @xcite calibrated empirically the metallicity dependence of @xmath7 .",
    "their slopes and zero points are in agreement ( within @xmath8 of each other ) .",
    "for instance , @xcite obtained @xmath9 } - 0.23 \\ mag\\ ] ] while udalski obtained @xmath10 } - 0.23 \\ mag\\ ] ] accounting for this correction , these authors obtain a distance modulus to the lmc of @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively .",
    "the aim of this letter is twofold .",
    "first , to provide a test of the accuracy of the rc method , and more particularly of the metallicity correction .",
    "second , to explore the influence of reddening corrections , by working in very low reddening systems ( fornax and carina ) .",
    "i also compare red clump distances for four galaxies ( carina , fornax and the magellanic clouds ) with distances obtained via the tip of the red giant branch and discuss the consequences .",
    "about 30 epochs of photometry have been obtained on two telescopes with the aim of searching for short period variable stars in the fornax dwarf galaxy ( bersier & wood , 1999 , 2000 ) . here",
    "i use only @xmath13 half the dataset that has been calibrated .",
    "full details on the data reduction will appear elsewhere ( bersier & wood , in preparation ) , only a short summary is given here .",
    "four fields in fornax have been observed between october and december 1997 with the 40  telescope at siding spring observatory ( australia ) , using @xmath14 and @xmath15 filters .",
    "the detector was a site @xmath16 ccd that gave a field of view of @xmath17 .",
    "between 12 and 18 images in @xmath14 and @xmath18 have been obtained for each of the four fields .",
    "the photometry has been done with dophot @xcite and calibrated using observations of landolt standard stars @xcite . from observations of stars in overlapping fields , i estimate that the absolute photometric zero - point is good to @xmath19 for each passband .    since there is a large number of observations per field , i computed the average of all @xmath20 measurements for each star .",
    "this clearly improves the photometric accuracy ; the average error at the magnitude of the red clump ( @xmath21 ) is @xmath22 mag .",
    "i then used the maps of @xcite to correct for reddening .",
    "this yielded values of @xmath23 between 0.02 and 0.04 for the vast majority of the stars .",
    "one then has @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram for the @xmath26 field is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig_cmd ] .",
    "the red clump appears to be very compact and well limited in color between @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_cmd ] ) . to obtain a distance ,",
    "the first step is to fit a function of the type @xmath29 \\label{eq_rcfit}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] following @xcite .",
    "the gaussian represents the red clump itself and the parabola accounts for the `` background '' giants .",
    "usually , stars are selected in the color range @xmath30 .",
    "it seems that in fornax the red clump reaches slightly bluer colors than 0.8 , however this is also where the fainter part of the clump merges with the horizontal branch . from the fits performed for different color ranges ,",
    "it is clear that bluer than @xmath31 the red clump is significantly fainter than for @xmath32 .",
    "the fact that the width of the clump is larger for @xmath33 than for @xmath32 is also an indication that the clump is contaminated by the horizontal branch .",
    "fitting eq .",
    "[ eq_rcfit ] to the whole red clump sample ( @xmath34 ) , one obtains @xmath35 . restricting the color range to @xmath36 gives @xmath37 ( see fig .  [ fig_fit ] ) .    in order to obtain a distance ,",
    "a metallicity correction to @xmath7 needs to be applied .",
    "i took [ fe / h]@xmath38 for two reasons : _",
    "i ) _ the average color of fornax s red clump is intermediate between the [ fe / h ] @xmath39 and [ fe / h ] @xmath40 cases of @xcite ; _ ii ) _ @xcite recently argued that the average metallicity of fornax is @xmath41 . using popowski s relation @xcite yields @xmath42 , then @xmath43 . ; using udalski relation , one has @xmath44 .",
    "it has been shown that the tip of the red giant branch is a reliable and accurate distance indicator ( e.g. lee et al .",
    "1993 ; sakai et al . 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "comparisons between trgb distances and cepheid distances in a number of galaxies have shown that there is excellent agreement between these two distance indicators ( e.g. lee et al .",
    "1993 , kennicutt et al .",
    "1998 , ferrarese et al .",
    "the absolute magnitude of the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) is almost constant , @xmath45 for [ fe / h]@xmath46 @xcite .    the average age and metallicity of red giants in fornax are such that the trgb method can safely be used .",
    "the @xmath18-band luminosity function of fornax is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig_trgb ] .",
    "the tip of the rgb is identified as the sharp number increase at @xmath47 ; the error is estimated to 0.05 mag .",
    "this yields a distance modulus of @xmath48 mag .",
    "it agrees very well with the distance modulus derived above with the red clump .",
    "it is also in perfect agreement with the distance derived by @xcite with the same method .",
    "the red clump and trgb distances agree in fornax , it is thus puzzling that they do nt agree in the lmc ( romaniello et al .",
    "2000 ; sakai et al . 2000 ) .",
    "it might be worth looking at other galaxies with rc and trgb distances to see how these distances compare .",
    "the difference @xmath49 does not depend on a particular calibration of the distance scale , it is an observable quantity .",
    "moreover , it should not be sensitive to reddening correction , hence it can be used to compare the two methods .",
    "i collected data in the literature for carina , the small and large magellanic clouds .",
    "for carina i took the red clump magnitude @xmath50 from @xcite and the trgb magnitude from @xcite .",
    "these authors used different values for the reddening @xmath23 so i used the observed magnitudes @xmath50 and @xmath51 _ without _ reddening correction ; these magnitudes are given in table  [ table_mags ] . for the smc , i used the data made publicly available by the ogle team @xcite . for the lmc i used the data of @xcite .",
    "i also took the trgb and rc magnitudes ( corrected for reddening ) published in @xcite for the lmc .",
    "all these numbers as well as @xmath52 are given in table  [ table_mags ] .",
    "the trgb is calibrated with galactic globular clusters that are old and metal - poor systems @xcite .",
    "the tip of the rgb is thus calibrated for ages larger than @xmath53 gyr and [ fe / h]@xmath46 .",
    "we know that these conditions are met in carina and fornax since these galaxies contain old and metal - poor stars .",
    "it is also well known that the lmc has a population of old and metal - poor stars ( as attested by the many thousands of rr lyrae known in the lmc ) .",
    "however , stars of intermediate ages ( 2 - 3 gyr ) and/or more metal - rich than [ fe / h]@xmath54 do exist in the lmc and they could contaminate the trgb . in other words , it could be that the trgb detected by @xcite is that of a young population .",
    "this seems very unlikely in view of the @xmath18-band luminosity function they present .",
    "the only possible brighter discontinuity in their luminosity function could be at @xmath55 ( although it looks more like a noise spike ) .",
    "furthermore , metal - rich stars younger than @xmath56 gyr would be distributed over a fairly wide range in magnitude and they would smooth out the @xmath57band luminosity function , they would not create such a sharp discontinuity . hence the magnitude @xmath58 ( from sakai et al .",
    "2000 ) must correspond to the tip of the red giant branch of the old population , and it is not affected by intermediate age stars . only very young red supergiants are as bright or brighter than old red giants , however there are very few supergiants compared to the number of rgb stars .",
    "hence the trgb magnitude should be robust , even in a galaxy that contains young and intermediate age populations such as the magellanic clouds .",
    "the magnitude difference @xmath52 is plotted as a function of [ fe / h ] in fig .",
    "[ fig_deltami ] .",
    "the solid line in this figure is the magnitude difference obtained with @xmath59 mag and @xmath60 - 0.23 $ ] @xcite .",
    "note that in this figure all points except the lower lmc point have not been corrected for reddening .",
    "two facts deserve some comments .",
    "first , there is a disagreement between the two lmc measurements .",
    "both are based on the same data set @xcite but one has been corrected for extinction while the other has not . in his referee report , a. udalski used ogle2 data to determine @xmath52 _ after _ correcting for reddening , using the ogle reddening map @xcite .",
    "he finds @xmath61 , virtually identical to 3.60 found here without reddening correction .",
    "this shows that the source of the discrepancy between trgb and rc distance measurements probably lies in the extinction correction rather than in the intrinsic properties of one or the other of these distance indicators .",
    "second , the solid line seems to represent very well the behavior of the difference @xmath62 , provided that the same reddening correction is applied to both red clump stars and tip giants , assuming that udalski s relation correctly predicts the metallicity dependence of the red clump and that the trgb absolute magnitude is @xmath59 mag .",
    "note that using popowski s relation for the red clump @xcite would change @xmath52 by a few hundredths of a magnitude only .",
    "the trgb is calibrated using rr lyrae stars @xcite ; the recent revision of rr lyrae magnitudes advocated by @xcite would decrease the brightness of the trgb . if the above procedure is correct , these two distance indicators can be in much better agreement than previously thought .",
    "i thank kris stanek for helpful discussions and dennis zaritsky for putting his mcps data at my disposal .",
    "i also thank the referee , a. udalski , for his challenging comments that improved the presentation and content of this paper .",
