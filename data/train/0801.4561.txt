    "giant planets forming by core accretion need to have cores of 10 - 20 m@xmath0 to be massive enough to accrete a gaseous envelope @xcite .",
    "this predicts that sizeable planet embryos form before circumstellar gas disks dissipate .",
    "these disks are typically modeled as passive accretion disks , optically thick and gas - dominated .",
    "their temperature structure is strongly dependent on heating from stellar irradiation @xcite . in particular",
    ", the disk temperatures depend strongly on the angle of incidence of the stellar irradiation on the disk surface .    while a substantial amount of work on numerical hydrodynamic simulations of planets embedded in disks has been carried out , calculating the radiative transfer of stellar irradiation in conjunction with these simulations",
    "is prohibitively difficult .",
    "simulations by @xcite illustrate the effect of hydrodynamics on the disk structure around a small embedded planet , but use an isothermal equation of state .",
    "the effects of mhd turbulence have been studied by @xcite and @xcite , but again , assuming a simple and unrealistic equation of state .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have made an effort to include radiative transfer as well as hydrodynamics in their calculations , but do not include the effects of stellar irradiaton on their models .",
    "the work presented in this paper does not include hydrodynamics , but rather focuses on the effects of stellar irradiation , which is a particularly important source of heating in the photospheres of disks .",
    "since it is the photospheres of optically thick disks that are observed , the effects of stellar irradiation at the surface of disks are an important consideration in predicting observations of protoplanetary disks .",
    "a limitation of the hydrodynamic simulations described above is that in order to adequately model the densest regions of the gas they are necessarily limited in spatial range above the midplane .",
    "the photosphere and surface of a disk are often several scale heights above the midplane .",
    "the models presented here are complementary to detailed hydrodynamic simulations for this reason .",
    "we are particularly interested in determining if the growing cores of giant planets produce effects that are observable .",
    "if these effects are observed , they would affirm the core accretion model as the paradigm for giant planet formation .",
    "while a fully - formed jupiter - mass planet would produce a larger feature in a disk , it would reveal little about how it formed .",
    "previous work on small planets embedded in optically thick gas disks indicates that sub - jovian mass planet cores can perturb the disk enough to alter the temperature structure of the disk in the immediate vicinity of the planet , with consequences for further evolution of the planet @xcite . in @xcite ( henceforth paper i and paper ii , respectively ) , the planet",
    "is predicted to gravitationally compress the disk in the vertical direction , creating a shadow paired with a bright spot , leading to temperature variations .",
    "however , those models were limited by being plane - parallel , despite the sizes of the simulation boxes used .",
    "in addition , while the density perturbations were calculated under hydrostatic equilibrium , they were not calculated self - consistently with the temperature perturbations .    in this paper ,",
    "we improve upon the model presented in papers i and ii by iteratively calculating the density and temperature structure of the disk for self - consistency and eliminating the assumption of a locally plane parallel model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  [ model ] we describe the basic model and the improvements we have made , in  [ stellarheating ] we elaborate in detail on the method we use for modeling radiative transfer , in  [ results ] we describe our results for a different planet masses and distances , in  [ discussion ] we discuss our results in comparison to previous models , and in  [ conclusion ] we present our conclusions .",
    "we adopt the formalism developed in @xcite ( henceforth , paper i & ii , respectively ) for calculating the effects on temperature of shadowing and brightening of stellar illumination at the disk s surface .",
    "these methods are based on those of @xcite and @xcite in a 1-d plane - parallel disk .",
    "the improvements made on the previous model include iteratively calculating the temperature and density structure of the disk for self - consistency .",
    "the new model is not plane - parallel as the previous models were .",
    "it accounts for the variation of disk structure with radius and the curvature of the disk in azimuth .",
    "each iteration proceeds as follows .",
    "starting with the density structure of the disk , we calculate the temperature of the disk in radiative equilibrium with viscous heating and stellar irradiation as heating sources .",
    "we adapt methods developed in papers i and ii to calculate radiative transfer on the surface of a perturbed disk .",
    "then , given the new temperature structure , we recalculate the density structure assuming vertical hydrostatic equlibrium .",
    "each of these steps are described in detail below .",
    "the initial conditions , which assume azimuthal symmetry , are calculated iteratively until they reach stability .",
    "the computationally intensive nature of the calculations prohibits large numbers of iterations when a planet is added , so relatively few iterations are carried out for the planet in the disk .",
    "we use rotating cyclindrical coordinates @xmath1 throughout , with the star at the origin , the planet at @xmath2 , and the @xmath3-axis aligned with the orbital angular momentum vector .",
    "we adopt parameters for the stellar mass , radius , and effective temperature of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 k , corresponding to an age of 1 myr @xcite .",
    "the mass accretion rate is @xmath7 , and the viscosity parameter is @xmath8 , which are typical of t - tauri type stars .",
    "the simulation box is centered on the planet at @xmath9 .",
    "the size of the box is scaled relative to the hill radius , @xmath10 .",
    "the box spans from @xmath11 to @xmath12 in @xmath13 , and from @xmath14 to @xmath15 in @xmath16 .",
    "the height of the box is set to @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the height of the unperturbed disk surface at @xmath19 .",
    "we assume symmtery across the midplane , so @xmath20 .",
    "the box is decomposed onto a grid of @xmath21 points equally spaced in @xmath13 , @xmath16 , and @xmath3 , with the grid slice at @xmath22 used as a placeholder for structure of the unperturbed disk .",
    "we use the opacities from @xcite using a dust model with parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 k , and @xmath25 , assuming that the dust opacities are constant throughout the disk .",
    "the values for the opacities ( in @xmath26 ) are as follows : the rosseland mean opacity is @xmath27 , the planck mean opacity integrated over the disk spectrum ( 300 k ) is @xmath28 , and the planck mean opacities integrated over the stellar spectrum ( 4000 k ) are @xmath29 for absorption alone and @xmath30 for absorption plus scattering .",
    "the absorption fraction is then @xmath31 , while the scattered fraction is @xmath32 .",
    "the rosseland mean opacity is used to calculate the photosphere of the disk , and @xmath33 is used to calculate the surface of the disk .      the basic calculation for radiative heating",
    "is described in detail in @xcite . here , we summarize those methods .",
    "the two main heating sources are from viscous heating ( @xmath34 ) and stellar irradiation ( @xmath35 ) , offset by radiative cooling , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is density , @xmath38 is the stefan - boltzmann constant and @xmath39 is the local temperature of the gas . under equilibrium conditions , @xmath40 if @xmath41 and @xmath42 give the equilibrium temperature for solely viscous heating or stellar irradiation , respectively , then it follows that the equilibrium temperature given both sources of heating is @xmath43      we assume that viscous flux is generated at the midplane and transported radiatively in a grey atmosphere so that @xmath44^{1/4}.\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the optical depth perpendicular to the disk using the rosseland mean opacity , @xmath46 : @xmath47 .",

    "viscous heating above the surface is assumed to be negligible .",
    "the amount of heating from stellar irradiation is calculated using methods developed in papers i and ii for a plane - parallel disk and adapted for a fully three - dimensional system .",
    "the full details of this calculated are rather lengthy , so this has been set out into  [ stellarheating ] .",
    "the gas moves in streamlines past the planet at approximately the keplerian rate , resulting in the shearing out of the hot and cold spots as material moves into and out of shadows and brightenings .",
    "the calculation is done in steady state , meaning that the gas is treated as a steady flow so that temperatures as a function of spatial position is constant even though the gas itself is in motion .",
    "given the bulk velocity along a particular streamline , the movement of the gas from one grid cell to the next is equivalent to a time step equal to the length of the grid cell divided by the velocity .",
    "the equilibrium temperature calculated in equation ( [ totalheat ] ) represents the total amount of heating due to disk viscosity and stellar irradiation .",
    "we assume that the specific heat per unit surface area of the disk is @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath55 is the mean molecular weight of the gas , which we assume to be primarily molecular hydrogen .",
    "then we can approximate the rate at which a parcel of gas radiatively heats or cools as @xmath56 if @xmath57 , the parcel of gas cools , if @xmath58 the parcel of gas heats .      to calculate the density profile for the disk , we assume hydrostatic equilibrium , @xmath59 where @xmath37 is the density , @xmath60 is the pressure , and @xmath61 is the @xmath3-component of gravity .",
    "we assume the ideal gas law , @xmath62 . in the absence of the planet ,",
    "the sole contribution to the gravity is the star : @xmath63 we use this equation to calculate the initial conditions .",
    "when a planet is added , the gravity has an additional contribution from the planet , so equation ( [ grav_unpert ] ) becomes @xmath64    given a vertical temperature profile , we calculate the density profile by integrating equation ( [ hse ] ) from the top of the simulation box down the midplane . for the perturbed disk ,",
    "we require conservation of the total surface density . in a standard viscous accretion disk ,",
    "the surface density of the disk and temperature of the disk are coupled .",

    "we adopt a standard shakura - sunyaev viscosity @xcite with @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a dimensionless parameter , @xmath70 is the sound speed at the midplane , and @xmath71 is the thermal scale height , given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the keplerian angular velocity .",
    "in this section , we describe the details of radiative transfer of stellar irradiation on the surface of a disk perturbed by a planet .",
    "these methods are based on the work of @xcite and @xcite which calculated the vertical temperature structure of a locally plane - parallel disk model without perturbations . in papers",
    "i and ii , we developed a method for using their solutions to calculate radiative transfer on a perturbed locally plane - parallel disk .",
    "here , we extend the formalism to a fully three - dimensional disk .    for a plane - parallel medium , the optical depth at disk - temperature frequencies perpendicular to the surface ( @xmath45 ) is related to the line - of - sight optical depth to stellar radiation ( @xmath74 ) as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the angle of incidence of the stellar radiation at the surface . as shown in paper ii , @xmath42 for a locally plane - parallel disk",

    "the contribution to the flux at point @xmath86 in the disk is proportional to @xmath87 as given in equation [ irradflux ] , with the optical depth calculated as @xmath88 where the integral is carried out along the line segment @xmath89 and @xmath90 is the cosine of the angle between @xmath89 and the surface element . the @xmath91 term on the left hand side of the equation accounts for the optical depth from the star to the surface .",
    "the second term on the left hand side of the equation is what @xmath74 would be between @xmath60 and the infinite plane represented by the surface element . defining @xmath92 to be the solid angle subtended by the surface element , then the total heating from stellar irradiation at @xmath60 in the limit",
    "as @xmath93 is @xmath94 for a plane parallel disk , this equation reverts to equation [ irradflux ] . to calculate this numerically over an assemblage of finite surface elements , we assume that @xmath95 stays fairly constant over a given surface element , and equation [ b_integral ] becomes @xmath96 the expression for @xmath97 integrated over an arbitrary triangle with respect to @xmath60 can be determined analytically as follows .",
    "we define @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 , to be the vectors that point from @xmath60 to the vertices of the triangle .",

    "@xmath130 , and @xmath131 , respectively . the angles of incidence are calculated as @xmath132 , and the contributions to radiative heating are summed over each triangle individually , with @xmath133 calculated at @xmath134 for all of them .    in order to avoid a discontinuity of temperature above the surface of the disk , the temperature above the surface",
    "is taken to be @xmath135 where @xmath76 is now the angle of incidence to the surface of constant @xmath74 : @xmath136    surface elements outside the simulation box are assumed to follow the same structure as the initial conditions , i.e.  unperturbed by a planet .",
    "regions with @xmath137 are approximated as `` strips '' extending from @xmath138 to @xmath139 and @xmath140 to @xmath141 .",
    "the surfaces interior to @xmath142 and exterior to @xmath143 are approximated as power laws ( @xmath144 ) and integrated over as a series of infinite - length strips extending in the @xmath16 direction .",
    "since we will be calculating the perturbed disk iteratively to take into account feedback between temperature and density perturbations , the initial disk itself must be stable to iterative feedback .",
    "we calculate the initial conditions for a slice in the middle of a box twice the size in @xmath16-space .",
    "that is , the slice is at @xmath145 in a box ranging from @xmath140 to @xmath138 with twice the number of grid points in @xmath16 , and the same range of @xmath13 and @xmath3 .",
    "outside the range of @xmath16 , the surface of the disk is approximated as strips from @xmath138 to @xmath139 . outside the range of @xmath13 , the surface",
    "is approximated as strips with infinite length in the @xmath16 direction , with the height @xmath3 varying as a power law in @xmath13 , fitted to the 8 points at the ends of the box .",
    "the unperturbed ( i.e.  without planet ) structure of the disk is calculated iteratively as described above , but since azimuthal symmetry is assumed , this computation is significantly shorter than the computation of the perturbed disk structure .",
    "thus , we iterate until the rms change in disk height is less than @xmath146 , typically less than about 200 iterations .",
    "we examine planets at @xmath147 , 2 , 4 , and 8 au with masses of 10 , 20 , and 50 m@xmath0 . the sizes and positions of the simulation boxes for each of these parameters",
    "is indicated in figure [ initcond ] .",
    "the limits of the simulation boxes in the @xmath13 direction are indicated by straight vertical lines : dotted , dashed , and solid for 10 m@xmath0 , 20 m@xmath0 , and 50 m@xmath0 planets , respectively .",
    "the boxes span from @xmath11 to @xmath12 in @xmath13 , and from @xmath148 to @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the height of the unperturbed disk surface at @xmath19 .",
    "the left set of plots in figure [ initcond ] show the density contours of the initial conditions for each set of planet parameters , dotted , dashed , and solid curves for 10 m@xmath0 , 20 m@xmath0 , and 50 m@xmath0 planets , respectively .",
    "the lower plot is a blow - up of the grey - outlined box in the upper plot .",
    "the density contours show a good amount of overlap over the range of parameter space .",
    "the right set of plots in figure [ initcond ] is similar to the left set , except it shows temperature rather than density .",
    "the temperature contours do not overlap as well as the density contours , particularly at larger radii . at the planets positions ,",
    "the temperature contour converge fairly well , but tend to diverge at the boundaries of the simulations .",
    "this results from the sensitivity of the temperature structure to the density structure of the disk . at small distances",
    ", the temperatures are domniated by viscous heating , so the shape of the surface is less relevant .",
    "however , viscous heating drops off more rapidly than stellar irradiation heating , so at large distances , slight deviations in the calculation of the surface can lead to changes of several degrees in the vertical temperature structure of the disk .",
    "the discrepancies in temperature may be overcome by increasing the size of the simulation box .",
    "however , this leads to a corresponding increase in the computation time .",
    "since the difference in temperatures tends to be on the order of just a few degrees and since we are interested in the changes in disk structure due to the influence of a planet in the disk , at this time we will adopt the initial conditions as presented here .",
    "the planet is instantaneously inserted into the initial conditions and the resulting density and temperature perturbations are calculated .",
    "the density and temperature are then iteratively recalculated under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium for 10 iterations . because the planet is instantaneously inserted into the disk and the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium , there is no time scale associated with each iteration .",
    "rather , the goal is to iterate until steady state is achieved .",
    "when evolution is discussed in this paper in the context of our disk - planet models , we refer to the changes in disk structure over successive iterations rather than a time sequence .",
    "the iterative calculation was implemented to achieve self - consistency between the temperature and density profiles of the disk under hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "this self - consistency proves to be important to determining the structure of the disk . as an example",
    ", we examine the case of a 20 m@xmath0 planet at 4 au . in figure",
    "[ timeevol ] we show the evolution of the surface perturbation ( left ) and corresponding evolution of the temperature in the photosphere of the disk ( right ) .",
    "the sequence of plots goes from left to right , top to bottom .",
    "the grey shaded circle shows the projected size of the hill sphere , looked down on the disk along the @xmath3-axis .",
    "contours in the left panel show the fractional deviation of the surface at the given iteration number from the initial conditions , spaced at intervals of @xmath149 .",
    "contours in the right panel show temperatures in the photosphere of the disk , where the photosphere is defined to be where the optical depth using the rosseland mean opacity integrated along the @xmath3-axis from @xmath150 toward @xmath151 equals @xmath91 .",
    "although the perturbation is quite subtle , less than @xmath152 , the change in the temperature at the photosphere is dramatic by comparison , on the order of @xmath153 or more .    with successive iterations ,",
    "the perturbation to the surface grows in area and deepens .",
    "this is seen in both the surface contours and photospheric temperatures .",
    "this is because the region in shadow cools and compresses , deepening the shadow further still . beyond the shadow , where the disk rises above the shadow , material heats and expands , causing this material to rise still further .",
    "the growth of the perturbation is limited both because of the differential rotation of disk material and because of the intrinsic radial temperature variation of the disk . the differential rotation of the disk means that material more radially distant from the planet moves past the planet faster , so it has less time to heat or cool as it passes by the planet .",
    "the intrinsic temperature structure of the disk means that inwards ( outwards ) of the planet , the disk is hotter ( cooler ) , limiting the growth of the shadow ( brightened region ) in that direction .",
    "iterations @xmath154 show very little difference between each other , indicating that the density and temperatures have reached self - consistency .",
    "figure [ sliceevol ] shows another view of the effect of iteration on the temperature structure of the disk .",
    "here we plot the temperature cross - section of the disk at @xmath145 , the location of the planet .",
    "the size of the hill sphere is represented by the grey ellipse ( the @xmath13 and @xmath3-axes are not scaled to each other ) .",
    "the surface layers are relatively unaffected by the the changing density structure , largely because this region is optically thin , and the dependence of temperature on angle of incidence is small .",
    "the midplane layer is relatively unaffected as well .",
    "this is due to several effects : viscous heating is greatest at the midplane ; the angular sizes of the shadowed / brightened regions are small ; and the disk is optically thick .",
    "the intermediate layers , change in temperature structure quite a bit .",
    "the development of a cooled region directly above the planet and the heated region outward from the planet are quite clearly evident .    meanwhile , the density structure changes only subtly . in figure",
    "[ denevol ] , we plot the density contours for the @xmath145 slice of the simulation box after 1 ( dotted lines ) and 10 ( solid lines ) iterations . over the 10 iterations , the density contours do change , but not as dramatically as the temperature perturbations .",
    "this emphasizes the importance of the detailed density structure to the calculation of radiative transfer in the disk .",
    "we investigate the changes to the disk temperature structure as planet mass and distance vary .",
    "we examine planets with masses of 10 , 20 and 50 m@xmath0 at 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 au .",
    "figure [ photospheres ] summarizes the changes in photosphere tempeartures for this suite of planet parameters .",
    "the contours in each of these plots indicate the absolute temperatures , while the greyscale reflects the fractional temperature variation from the initial conditions , dark for cooling and lighter for heating . in general , the cooled region",
    "is centered at the planet s position , while the headed region is outside the planet s orbit .",
    "the asymmetry in the perturbations are a result of including the differential rotation of the disk and a finite time scale for cooling / heating as a parcel of gas passes through a shadow / brightening . the sizes of the perturbations roughly scale both with planet mass and distance .    in figs .",
    "[ tempslice_a1]-[tempslice_a8 ] , we show radial cross - sections of the temperature structure at ( from left to right ) 1 hill radius downstream from the planet , at the planet position , and 1 hill radius upstream of the planet , for the planet parameters examined in this study .",

    "we now compare our results to those of papers i and ii .",
    "the results presented there were for planets around a star of 0.5 m@xmath155 , while those presented here are for a 1 m@xmath155 star . in order to make a fair comparison , we have recomputed the model presented in papers i and ii for the stellar parameters used in this paper",

    "the disk is treated as locally plane - parallel , whereas in the new model it is not .",
    "this is reflected in the shape of the temperature structures of the two models .",
    "another difference is that the surface was calculated as the contour of constant density in j - cs .",

    "when this contour is shadowed , the surface is instead taken to be the line of sight to the star , indicated by the solid red line .",

    "[ compare_a4p20 ] and [ oldplot ] that the temperature perturbations are much greater in j - cs .",

    "since the j - cs calculation assumed a plane - parallel disk , the temperature contours trace the color variations . in the calculation presented in this paper , the temperatures are dominated by the radial variation of the unperturbed disk.,title=\"fig:\",width=163 ]    in the jc - s model , @xmath156 in the shadowed region , which means that zero flux was propagated from shadowed surface elements to disk material below them .",
    "when the density contour rose back above the shadow , the transition from shadow to the illuminated region was quite sharp , with relatively large values of @xmath76 yielding large amounts of heating . in the new model ,",
    "since the surface is calculated by integrating the optical depth along lines of sight to the star , the transitions are smoother and values of @xmath76 do not vary as greatly .",
    "also , as shown in equation ( [ mu ] ) , we set a minimum value for @xmath76 based on the finite size of the star , so shadowing can not result in as significant cooling as seen in j - cs .",
    "yet another effect is the radial variation in stellar flux , which was not taken into account in the plane - parallel j - cs model .",
    "the disk is hotter / cooler closer to / farther from the star , which offsets some of the effects of shadowing / illumination . although the j - cs model was not iterative",
    "while the new model is , the changes in the calculation of the surface and @xmath76 are sufficient to diminish the temperature perturbations near the planet .",
    "another difference between j - cs and this work is the locations of the heated and cooled regions . in j - cs ,",
    "these regions are nearly symmetric with respect to the planet position .",
    "the sizes and shapes of the heated and cooled regions are similar , with the cooled region inward of the planet and the heated region outward of it . in the current work , the cooled region in centered on the planet s position with the heated region outward of the planet .      in paper ii",
    ", we found a correlation between the maximum and minimum photosphere temperature variations and the hill radius of the planet .",
    "we now perform the same analysis on the new model .",
    "in figure [ temp_vs_rhill ] , we plot the maximum and minimum fractional temperature variations in the photospheres versus the ratio of the hill radius to thermal scale height of the disk ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "points above / below @xmath158 represent maxima / minima .",
    "the symbols denote at what distance the planet is : triangles for 1 au , diamonds for 2 au , squares for 4 au , and asterisks for 8 au .",
    "the results for j - cs are plotted connected by dashed lines . as noted in paper ii ,",
    "the maxima and minima lie nearly on the same curves .",
    "the upturn in minimum temperatures at smaller distances is due to the rise in viscous heating closer to the star , which sets the absolute temperature minimum .",
    "the points connected by dotted lines in figure [ temp_vs_rhill ] are temperature maxima / minima in the photospheres after one iteration , i.e.  without recalculating the density given the new temperature structure .",
    "these points similarly lie on nearly the same curves , except showing a much smaller temperature perturbation than jc - s .",
    "the reasons for the smaller temperature variation was detailed in  [ prevmod ] .",
    "the effect of including iterations can be seen by comparison to the points connected by solid lines in figure [ temp_vs_rhill ] . in all cases ,",
    "the fractional temperature variations increase .",
    "however , the amount of change is not consistent with planet mass or distance . at 1 au ( triangles ) , the change in temperature minima is nearly negligible .",
    "this can be explained by viscous heating , which halts the growth of the cooled , shadowed region .",
    "the temperature maxima do increase , but not as much as at larger distances .",
    "this is because the growth of the brightened region is coupled to the growth of the shadowed region : as the shadowed region grows , more disk material behind the shadow is exposed and illuminated . since shadow growth is limited at 1 au , so is the growth of the brightened region .",
    "going from 2 to 4 to 8 au , viscous heating ceases to be important .",
    "the temperature maxima all lie close to the same curve at those distances , and the temperature minima at 4 and 8 au lie nearly on the same curve in figure [ temp_vs_rhill ] .    for larger planets , those whose hill radii approach the disk thermal scale height , the amount of heating in the current model approaches that seen in j - cs . however , the temperature minima never drop that low .",
    "this can be attributed to the minimum value of @xmath76 that has been adopted for the new model .",
    "there is such upper limit that has been imposed however , hence the greater heating .",
    "although the variation in temperature appears to be less in the present model than that seen in j - cs , figs .",
    "[ compare_a4p20 ] and [ oldplot ] suggest that the spatial scale of the perturbations might be larger . to check this",
    ", we calculate the areas of the photosphere that are heated or cooled above or below a certain threshold .",
    "we call these regions hot or cold `` spots . ''",
    "note that this is different from the definition of a `` spot '' in paper ii , which considered regions heated or below 170 k , in the context of ice formation and the snow line . here",
    ", we consider the deviation in temperature from the unperturbed value , rather than above or below a fixed threshold .",
    "a separate paper addressing the effect of these temperature perturbations on the snow line is addressed by @xcite .",
    "we define the area of a spot to be the area of the photosphere that is heated or cooled to at least half the maximum temperature deviation , excluding the area just above the hill sphere .",
    "these spot areas are plotted as filled triangles ( hot ) or squares ( cold ) in figure [ hotcoldareas ] connected by dashed lines , black for the current models , grey for j - cs .",
    "the temperature deviations for the 10 m@xmath0 planet at 8 au are so small that the area of a cold spot is not well - defined .",
    "the spot masses are generally larger for our results than for the jc - s models .",
    "the sizes of cold spots tend to grow faster with increasing planet mass than the sizes of hot spots .",
    "let us also consider temperature perturbations above or below a threshold of 10% .",
    "the area of these spots versus the area of a circle with radius @xmath159 is plotted as open triangles ( hot ) or squares ( cold ) in figure [ hotcoldareas ] connected by dotted lines , black for the current models , grey for j - cs . lines connected to points below the edge of the graph indicate lack of a spot .",
    "note that at 1 au , there are no hot spots above a 10% temperature deviation , consistent with figure [ temp_vs_rhill ] .",
    "the j - cs models produce hot at cold spots for planet parameters . at all distances ,",
    "10 m@xmath0 planets are too small to create either hot or cold spots at the 10% level in the new models .",
    "where cold spots do exist , they are generally larger than those produced in j - cs",
    ". however , the hot spots are generally smaller .    while the temperature deviations predicted from the current models are not as great as those predicted in j - cs , they are larger in spatial extent .",
    "this may have consequences for observability of this phenomenon .",
    "this topic will be addressed in a companion paper .",
    "this paper presents a model for calculating the density and temperature perturbations imposed on a protoplanetary disk by an embedded protoplanet .",
    "the basic radiative transfer model is adopted from papers i and ii , but a number of improvements have been made on that work such as density - temperature self - consistency and eliminating the assumption of a plane - parallel system .",
    "we have shown that self - consistently calculating the temperature and density significantly increases the effect of planet perturbations by means of postive feedback , where shadowed regions cool and contract and brightened regions heat and expand .",
    "this demonstrates the importance of self - consistency when calculating disk structure with radiative transfer . while it has already been acknowledged that stellar irradiation heating is important in setting overall disk structure ( e.g.",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this work shows that it is important for considering local perturbations on the disk .",
    "another important result of this paper is that the temperature structure of the disk is extremely sensitive to the angle of incidence of stellar irradiation at the surface .",
    "the precise determination of the surface of the disk is critical to accurately calculating the temperature structure of the disk . in previous work",
    "we had assumed that the surface of constant density was a sufficiently good approximatation for the surface , but in this work we show that that overestimated the temperature perturbation to the disk .",
    "we have omitted some important physics in this calculation .",
    "we do not include heating from accretion onto the planet .",
    "we consider the embedded planet to act simply as a gravitational point mass , and focus only on the vertical component of gravity .",
    "we do not account for non - linearities such as spiral density waves .",
    "all these effects are more adequately addressed using a three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulation of a planet embedded in a disk of gas . however , since simulations of this sort focus on the bulk flow of gas at the midplane , they typically have insufficient resolution above the midplane to accurately calculate the surface of the disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "calculation of radiative transfer , even without iterating for self - consistency , is very computationally intensive . to do this iteratively and",
    "coupled with three - dimensional hydrodynamics is challenging , but is the next logical step to improving the accuracy of our results ."
