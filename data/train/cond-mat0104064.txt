    "equilibrium surface phase transitions have been a topic of research for several decades .",
    "various types of critical behaviors are well established both in theoretical models and actual experiments .",
    "this includes surface roughening  @xcite , surface melting  @xcite , and surface reconstruction  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the competition between these phenomena leads to additional phases and phase transitions , like disordered flat phases , preroughening transitions , and reconstructed rough phases  @xcite .",
    "roughening induced deconstruction in pt(110 ) @xcite and preroughening induced deconstruction in si(110 ) type geometries are other examples of this competition  @xcite .    the theory of dynamic non - equilibrium processes like surface growth has flourished during the last decade as well .",
    "several new types of dynamic universality classes have been identified .",
    "kpz type growth is one example  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in this area a gap seems to widen between theoretical and experimental interests .",
    "theoretical oriented research tends to focus on universal aspects of these processes , such as the large scale properties of growing surfaces in the stationary growing state and on how this state is approached in the asymptotic large time limit .",
    "experimental oriented research tends to focus on more microscopic short distance aspects of growing surfaces , e.g. , as encountered in actual epitaxial growth .",
    "one of the fundamental issues , relevant to both perspectives , is whether any of the above equilibrium surface phase transitions persist in the stationary state of growing interfaces . in this paper",
    "we address whether surface reconstruction order can exist during growth .",
    "this issue is related to the absence of surface roughening transitions in growing surfaces .",
    "below the equilibrium roughening transition temperature @xmath3 the growing surface is rough at large length scales , but remains flat and grows layer - by - layer at distances shorter than a crossover length scale @xmath1 , which varies with temperature and oversaturation .",
    "we review this briefly in section  [ nucleation ] in the context of elementary nucleation theory .",
    "consider a surface that is flat and reconstructed in equilibrium at low temperatures .",
    "below @xmath3 it appears to grow within @xmath4 as flat in a layer - by - layer mode .",
    "moreover , below @xmath5 ( if @xmath6 ) it appears as reconstructed if the new particles can find their proper reconstruction positions at times scales that are short compared to the rate at which a new layer is completed .",
    "presume that this is indeed the case .",
    "the next , more intriguing question is whether @xmath0 can be larger than @xmath1 ; i.e. , whether rough growing surfaces be reconstructed ?",
    "the compatibility of surface roughness with surface reconstruction was addressed in the context of equilibrium phase transitions several years ago .",
    "the answer depends on intricate details of the surface topology .",
    "for example , in missing row reconstructed ( mrr ) ( 110 ) facets in fcc crystals , like au and pt , roughness is incompatible with reconstruction order , and the surface roughening transition must destroy the reconstruction simultaneously  @xcite . in such geometries , the reconstruction order can not exist in growing surfaces beyond the roughness length scale either , and @xmath7 .    surface roughness and reconstruction are compatible with each other in other crystal structures .",
    "simple cubic ( sc ) mr reconstructed ( 110 ) facets are an example . in equilibrium",
    ", they can roughen before the reconstruction order deconstructs , @xmath8 .",
    "the intermediate phase is known as a reconstructed rough phase  @xcite . for those surfaces it might be possible to observe genuine deconstruction type phase transitions in growing surfaces . or , if not",
    ", the surface reconstruction can at least persist well beyond the roughness crossover length scale , @xmath9 , and will be limited by an independent mechanism .",
    "these issues are the topic of our research reported here .",
    "in section  [ nucleation ] we review rough versus layer - by - layer growth in surfaces , and in section  [ recrough ] the basic properties of equilibrium reconstructed rough phases .",
    "next , in section [ recroughgrowth ] , we start to focus on the reconstruction versus dynamic roughness issue , and then , in section  [ rsosmodel ] , we choose a specific type of reconstruction and a specific type of surface growth dynamics to study it quantitatively by means of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "the model must be as simple as possible , avoiding secondary effects that might obscure the central issue .",
    "our choice is the so - called restricted solid - on - solid ( rsos ) model with negative step energies , which describes a simple cubic checker board type reconstruction , and kpz type growth .",
    "the mc simulation results are presented in section  [ mcdata ] , and analyzed in section  [ trappedloops ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ conclude ] we summarize our results .",
    "the topic of this paper is whether surface reconstruction order can exist during growth , but as a start it is useful to review briefly the related issue of dynamic surface roughness from a long and short length scale perspective .",
    "elementary nucleation theory suffices for this purpose .",
    "equilibrium crystal surfaces undergo well defined roughening transitions from macroscopic flat to macroscopic rough . on the other hand ,",
    "growing surfaces are theoretically `` always rough ''  @xcite .",
    "this seems at odds with practical reality , where surfaces appear to grow quite differently below and above the equilibrium roughening temperature @xmath3 .",
    "above @xmath3 they are rough ( dynamic roughness ) while below @xmath3 they seem flat ( layer - by - layer step - flow growth ) .",
    "above @xmath3 the growth velocity @xmath10 is proportional to the oversaturation @xmath11 , while below @xmath3 it is inversely proportional to a nucleation time scale @xmath12 with @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "@xmath14 is the equilibrium step free energy . as a result ,",
    "crystal growth shapes have sharp angles , in which many facets , including all that are above their @xmath3 , are missing .",
    "this apparent difference in growth mechanism is one of the most useful experimental tools to locate equilibrium roughening transitions in crystal facets .",
    "the origin of the exponential factor in @xmath15 is the existence of a nucleation barrier for creating a terrace of height @xmath16 below @xmath3 .",
    "the edge ( step ) free energy loss term ( proportional to @xmath14 times the circumference ) competes with the surface energy gain term ( proportional to @xmath17 times the terrace area ) .",
    "the nucleation barrier vanishes when the step free energy @xmath14 vanishes , i.e. , at @xmath3 . after a new terrace larger",
    "than the nucleation thresholds is nucleated with an exponential small probability , it spreads out fast by particle adhesion at its edge into a macroscopic domain , until it merges with other spreading terraces that have nucleated in the mean time , and thus complete the new surface layer .",
    "however , new terraces are nucleated on top of spreading terraces as well .",
    "this nesting effect , together with the spatial fluctuations of nucleation events leads to a loss of a well defined ( length scale free ) global reference surface level .",
    "this means that although at small enough length scales the surface looks flat and seems to grow layer - by - layer , at large length scales it is rough .",
    "there is no phase transition between the layer - by - layer and rough growth regimes , only a characteristic crossover length scale .",
    "the latter is of order @xmath18 , with @xmath19 the step velocity ( determined by the particle deposition rate at the step edge ) and @xmath15 the above time scale at which terrace nuclei are being created .",
    "surface flatness can not be maintained during growth over large length scales , but at small oversaturations ( @xmath17 ) and sufficiently below @xmath3 ( large step free energies @xmath14 ) the growing surface can appear to be flat for all practical purposes , over any typical experimental length scale .    the same type of issues arise in our study concerning the compatibility of surface reconstruction order with growth dynamics .",
    "first we address whether surface reconstruction order can persist during growth at macroscopic length scales ( the thermodynamic limit ) ; and , if not , whether it might still exist in a practical sense within a characteristic length scale , @xmath0 below the equilibrium reconstruction temperature @xmath5 .",
    "surface reconstruction is conventionally associated with flat interfaces .",
    "however , surface roughness not necessarily destroys the reconstruction order .",
    "a rough but still reconstructed surface is in a so - called reconstructed rough ( rr ) phase .",
    "the equilibrium versions of rr phases were studied theoretically some years ago in the context of the competition between surface roughening and reconstruction in mr reconstructed fcc ( 110 ) facets  @xcite .",
    "the topological details of those fcc surface prevent the existence of rr phases , implying that in pt(110 ) the surface roughness and deconstructs simultaneously  @xcite as observed experimentally in pt(110 )  @xcite .",
    "this implies immediately that during growth reconstruction order is limited to the roughness crossover length scale , @xmath20 . the same theoretical studies also identified other surface geometries where rr phases do exist . for those @xmath0",
    "is not limited by @xmath1 . in this section",
    "we review the basic properties of rr phases , using as examples checkerboard and mr type reconstructed simple cubic stackings .    to avoid confusion , it is useful to distinguish between misplacement and displacement type reconstruction  @xcite . in misplacement reconstructions ,",
    "particles have moved to different solid - on - solid type stacking positions , or are removed altogether , compared to the unreconstructed flat surface structure . the checker board reconstruction in fig.[chkbrd ] and also",
    "the more realistic mr type reconstructions are examples of this",
    ". the average surface height has changed by half a unit , @xmath21 . in displacement reconstructions",
    "the atomic stacking does not change . instead , the atoms are merely elastically distorted at the surface with a commensurate or incommensurate period compared to the bulk .",
    "misplacement type reconstructions are more likely to disorder at temperatures near @xmath3 than displacement type reconstructions .",
    "for clarity we focuses here on misplacement reconstructions .",
    "the definition of the reconstruction order parameter is at the core of rr phases  @xcite . in checker board and mr reconstructed sc ( 110 ) facets , the reconstruction order can be formulated in two distinct ways .",
    "one formulation keeps track of whether the black or white fields ( even or odd rows ) are on top .",
    "the other measures it in terms of anti - ferromagnetic order in the parity type ising variables @xmath22 , with @xmath23 the surface height at site @xmath24 , see fig.[scmr ] .",
    "these two formulations might seem equivalent in flat surfaces , but they are not in the presence of roughness .",
    "the compatibility of surface reconstruction with surface roughness depends on topological properties of step and domain wall excitations ; on how they affect the two versions of the order parameter .",
    "fig.[scmr ] shows in cartoon style a cross section of the reconstructed surface , and also domain wall and step excitations .",
    "the domain wall in ( b ) does not change the surface height .",
    "notice that both order parameters change sign . across the step in ( c ) , from left to right , the even - odd order parameter changes sign , but the parity order is unaffected . at the step in ( d )",
    "the opposite happens .",
    "these two types of steps are the only topologically distinct ones that are possible ; ( c ) couples only to the even - odd row type order parameter and ( d ) only to to the parity version .",
    "it is possible to construct many more step and domain wall structures that look locally different from the ones in the figure , but those induce the same change in height and/or reconstruction order(s ) and therefore are from a topological point of view identical to the ones in the figure .",
    "notice also that the excitations in ( b)-(d ) are related to each other in the sense that any of the three can be interpreted as a bound state the two others .",
    "elastic surface deformations in the actual atomic positions near the surface and additional ones near the steps and domain walls , influence the local internal structure of steps and domain walls , but do not affect those topological features , and therefore need not explicitly be represented in the following discussion .",
    "( they certainly renormalize the step and domain wall energies and the interactions between such surface excitations . )",
    "the fate of reconstruction versus roughness depends on the energies of these steps and domain walls , including the kink energies .",
    "they set the scale of the meander type entropy and therefore the temperature dependence of the step free energies .",
    "if the domain wall free energy vanishes first , the surface remains flat but the reconstruction vanishes , @xmath6 . in case the free energy of one of the two types of steps vanishes first , the surface enters a reconstructed rough phase , @xmath8 . at the roughening transition one of the two reconstruction order parameters vanishes , but the other type of order remains .",
    "so there exist two topologically distinct types of rr phases .",
    "( notice that only the one with the parity type order is readily observable by , e.g. , conventional x - ray diffraction . )    in the rsos model below , the rr phase has parity order , i.e. , the step free energy of the ( c ) type steps is zero , but walls and ( d ) type steps still have non - zero free energy .",
    "we will refer to those excitations as  loops of zero s \" , because in the rough surface they show up as contours across which the height change is zero , @xmath25 .",
    "the deconstruction transition ( inside the rough phase ) takes place at the temperature where the surface tension of the loops vanishes . in equilibrium that turns out to be an ordinary ising transition",
    "this conclude our brief review . for more details",
    "we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "let s focus now on surface growth . only in surfaces where equilibrium rr phases are topologically possible , can the surface reconstruction length scale @xmath0 exceed the onset of dynamic roughness length scale @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , it is quite possible that the reconstruction order persists over all length scales ( @xmath26 ) , such that a genuine dynamic deconstruction phase transition takes place in the stationary state of the growing surface , just like in equilibrium .",
    "for comparison , imagine a two dimensional ( 2d ) lattice with on each site an height variable and an ising spin degree of freedom ( representing the reconstruction order ) .",
    "this leads to two coupled master equations , one for surface growth , e.g. , kpz type dynamics , and another for the reconstruction order , e.g. , glauber type ising dynamics . in equilibrium surfaces , the coupling between the two sectors is weak , to the extend that the reconstruction transition in the ising sector and the roughening transition in the height variable sector do not interfere with each other  @xcite .",
    "the central issue is whether and how this coupling changes during growth .",
    "the ising dynamics itself , is blind to the growth bias .",
    "if the coupling between the two sectors is remains weak , the ising spins can still reach the gibbs equilibrium state and undergo a conventional equilibrium reconstruction transition .",
    "coupled master equations of this type have been studied recently in the context of specific 1d growth models .",
    "those display strong coupling between the ising and roughness degrees of freedom , such as growth being pinned down by ising domain walls  @xcite . pinning favors to spontaneous facetting . in our 2d model ,",
    "we observe different effects , besides the obvious fact that in 1d equilibrium reconstruction order can not exist .",
    "the 2d restricted solid on solid ( rsos ) is one of the work horses of surface physics research .",
    "integer valued height variables @xmath27 are assigned to a square lattice and nearest neighbor heights are restricted to differ by at most one unit , @xmath28 .",
    "the energy @xmath29 depends only on nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "we use dimensionless units , @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath31 side of the phase diagram contains a conventional equilibrium surface roughening transition  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the non - equilibrium version has been studied extensively for @xmath31 as well , because it is a natural lattice realization of kpz growth  @xcite .    for @xmath32",
    ", the model contains one of the simplest examples of an equilibrium rr phase  @xcite , and is probably the most compact formulation of the coupling between ising and surface degrees of freedom .",
    "the @xmath33 steps are more favorable than flat @xmath25 segments . at zero temperature , @xmath34 ,",
    "the @xmath25 states are frozen out , and the model reduces to the so - called body centered solid on solid ( bcsos ) model , but in this version it lacks step energies , which means that the surface is rough even at zero temperature . the surface is rough , but since nearest neighbor heights must differ by one , all heights on one sublattice are even and odd at the other , or the other way around .",
    "this two - fold degeneracy represents the checker board type rr order .",
    "the staggered magnetization , defined in terms of the parity spin type variables @xmath35 , is non - zero .",
    "the @xmath25 excitations that appear at @xmath36 form closed loops and behave like ising type domain walls .",
    "the reconstruction order changes sign across such loops .",
    "their sizes diverge at the equilibrium deconstruction transition @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "( determined by transfer matrix finite size scaling techniques ) .",
    "the ising and roughness variables couple only weakly .",
    "numerically , all reconstruction aspects of the transition follow conventional ising critical exponents .",
    "moreover , the thermodynamic singularities in the ising sector affect only the temperature dependence of the surface roughness parameter @xmath38 , defined in terms of the height - height correlator , @xmath39 the continuum limit analysis confirms these numerical results .",
    "the point in the generalized phase diagram where the gaussian ( height ) and ising degrees of freedom decouple is a stable renormalization type fixed point  @xcite .",
    "we study this same rsos model in the presence of a kpz type growth bias . in the mc simulation",
    ", we first select an update column and next whether a particle deposition or evaporation event will be attempted .",
    "the move is rejected if it would result in a violation of the rsos condition , @xmath28 .",
    "if allowed , it will take place with probability @xmath40 in case of deposition , and with probability @xmath41 for evaporation . without loss of generality we can choose @xmath42 . at infinite temperature ( @xmath43 ) and deposition",
    "only ( @xmath44 ) the model reduces to the well known kim - kosterlitz  @xcite model for kpz type growth .",
    "we will present only our mc results far from equilibrium , i.e. , at @xmath44 with deposition only .",
    "we observe no qualitative differences closer to equilibrium , @xmath45 , but the interpretation of the data becomes increasingly obscured ( as expected ) by ( conventional ) crossover scaling from the equilibrium deconstruction phase transition .    at low temperatures , @xmath46 ,",
    "the metropolis dynamics slows down considerably .",
    "the rejection rate becomes high and the density of active sites becomes low .",
    "therefore we employ the following rejection free algorithm . during the mc simulation",
    "we keep a list of active sites , i.e. , sites where particles can deposit without violating the rsos condition .",
    "they are grouped in @xmath47 sets , according to the five distinct energy changes @xmath48 that can occur during deposition .",
    "first we preselect one of those 5 sets , with probability @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the number of sites of type @xmath52 .",
    "next , a particle is randomly deposited at one of the sites in that specific set @xmath52 .",
    "rejection free procedures like this upset the flow of time . to restore proper time",
    ", we increase the mc time during each update step by @xmath53 .",
    "we checked explicitly that this reproduces the correct value for the kpz dynamic exponent @xmath54  @xcite at @xmath55 ; we find @xmath56 .",
    "the above algorithm resolves the slowing down problem in the actual mc simulation , but does not address its origin . in the limit @xmath57 the rsos model reduces to the bcsos model , with @xmath33 at all bonds .",
    "the @xmath25 loops are frozen out completely . in bcsos",
    "type kpz growth dynamics , 2 particles are deposited at ones in the form of vertically oriented bricks , otherwise a `` forbidden '' configuration with @xmath25 would arise . in the @xmath32 rsos model at very low temperatures",
    "the same event is achieved as a 2-step two - particle process , by the deposition of a second particle at the same site soon after the first one .",
    "the probability for deposition of the first particle is equal to @xmath58 .",
    "the second particle deposition on top of it happens with probability @xmath59 ) .",
    "this implies that the time clock in the rsos model runs slower by a factor @xmath60 .    a final remark about surface roughness .",
    "in normal surfaces , the equilibrium roughness increases with temperature ; due to the fact that meander type entropy renormalizes the step energy into a reduced step free energy  @xcite . in our model",
    ", surface roughness evolves the opposite way ; it decreases with temperature .",
    "the surface is less rough at infinite temperature @xmath43 than in the zero temperature limit @xmath34 .",
    "a high temperature rsos surface , with @xmath28 is obviously less rough than a bcsos surface , with only @xmath33 .",
    "recall that this bcsos model lacks step energies , such that it is just as rough at @xmath61 as at @xmath62 . from the bcsos perspective",
    "the thermally excited @xmath25 loops stiffen the surface , and give rise to an inverted roughness versus temperature profile .",
    "on the one hand , this is an interesting phenomena in its own right .",
    "moreover we could fine tune it by introducing next - nearest neighbor interactions , since they represent bcsos type step energies . on the other hand ,",
    "this effect is unlikely to affect the central question we want to address ( how do roughness and reconstruction degrees couple during growth ) and therefore we choose not do so in this study .",
    "we search for reconstruction order as function of temperature , for @xmath63 .",
    "the susceptibility type parameter  @xcite , @xmath64 of the reconstruction order parameter , @xmath65 is shown in fig.[susclps ] for the stationary state of the growing surface , as function of @xmath66 for different system sizes @xmath67 .",
    "the sharp maxima seem to confirm the existence of a dynamic surface reconstruction transition into a rr phase . however , several features are very different from equilibrium .",
    "the peak height diverges as @xmath68 .",
    "i.e. , stronger than at the equilibrium transition point where it scales as @xmath69 .",
    "this could be a signal of a first order phase transition .",
    "however , the peak position does not converge to a specific critical point @xmath70 .",
    "instead it keeps shifting with lattice size .",
    "it scales logarithmically , as @xmath71 with @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "next , we monitor in detail the reconstruction order parameter @xmath74 near and below the equilibrium @xmath70 as function of time .",
    "it behaves similar as in conventional spontaneously ordered phases , but flip - flops more frequently than justifiable from finite size effects alone .",
    "moreover , the fluctuations in @xmath74 within each phase are too strong .",
    "fig.[mhstgm ] quantifies this in terms of a histogram of the number of times a specific value of @xmath74 appears in a typical time series .",
    "the distribution has two distinct peaks , suggesting the presence of spontaneously broken reconstruction order , but the tails have a power law shape instead of the exponential form mandatory for a spontaneous broken symmetry .",
    "power laws are the hallmark of critical fluctuations .",
    "so , quite surprisingly , it appears as if the rr order is critical at low temperatures for all @xmath75 . instead of an isolated critical point",
    ", we seem to be dealing with a critical phase .",
    "the surprising critical fluctuations in the reconstruction order parameter can be traced to the following loop dynamics .",
    "consider a typical configuration at very low temperatures .",
    "fig.[trappedloop ] shows an example  @xcite .",
    "the surface is in an almost pure bcsos type dynamic rough stationary state ( with @xmath76 ) , and contains only a few @xmath25 loops separating surface areas of opposite checker board type rr order .",
    "the typical life cycle of such a loop runs as follows .",
    "it is nucleated in a valley bottom .",
    "next it runs up hill , grows in diameter , encompassing the entire valley , until it becomes trapped on a ridge line .",
    "there it lingers until another loop annihilates it , or when the kpz surface fluctuations to which it is slaved shrink it back to zero .",
    "fig.[1d_dyn](a ) represents a cross - section of the 2d rough surface near a valley .",
    "it shows a domain of opposite reconstruction inside an otherwise perfectly reconstructed rough configuration .",
    "the two flat segments are the locations where the domain wall loop intersects the cross section . in equilibrium",
    ", the loop fluctuates with equal probability up and down the slope because depositions and evaporations are equally likely .",
    "a growth bias breaks this symmetry , the loops move more likely upwards than downwards , see fig.[1d_dyn](a ) . this upward drift is the driving force responsible for the trapping of loops at ridge lines , and thus creates a strong coupling between the roughness and reconstruction degrees of freedom , unlike equilibrium where they effectively decouple",
    ".    a few comments on the topology of ridge lines in rough surfaces might be useful .",
    "imagine a rolling ball in this landscape , like in the well known analogy with renormalization flow in statistical physics .",
    "presume strong friction such that the velocity is proportional to the force , i.e. , the gradient of the slope , at all times .",
    "the hill tops are the completely unstable `` fixed points '' .",
    "the valleys are the attractors .",
    "the ridge lines form the water sheds between valleys .",
    "every ridge line runs from an hill top to a saddle point . from each hill",
    "top an arbitrary number of ridge lines can emerge , but only two ridge lines can end at each saddle point ( at opposite sides of the single direction in which the saddle point attracts ) .",
    "so the ridge lines form a network , and since none of them can not stop in midair it is a closed network .",
    "the kpz rough surface is scale invariant , which means that this ridge line network has fractal properties .",
    "ignore for the time being the scale invariant aspects of the network .",
    "imagine a landscape consisting of deep smooth valleys surrounded by ridge lines ; unlike the real rough surface where every deep valley consists of collections of sub valleys .",
    "the life cycle of a macroscopic loop in this surface starts with the nucleation of a new seedling - loop at the floor of the valley and its rise along the slopes , during which it grows into a macroscopic object .",
    "the only loops of interest are those nucleated at the valley bottom and then run up - hill encompassing the entire valley . only those loops are topologically trapped and stable .",
    "loops nucleated on the slopes annihilate by stochastic fluctuations before becoming macroscopically large .",
    "the same is true for loops nucleated out of the valley bottom but running up - hill on one slope segment only .",
    "the rise of a seedling loop out of the valley bottom into a macroscopic object , is a very fast process .",
    "almost no mc moves that make the loop grow and rise are rejected ; energy barriers are rare , because the length of the loop ( its energy ) increases uniformly .",
    "compared to this , the nucleation frequency in the valley bottom is very small .",
    "this means that the time scale at which a macroscopic loop emerges out of the valley is limited by the nucleation time scale @xmath77 and independent of the valley size .    to measure @xmath77",
    "we prepared a surface in the bcsos kpz stationary state and measure ( at a very low temperature , @xmath78 ) the intervals between macroscopic loop events .",
    "numerically we find @xmath79 ( measured in bcsos time units ) with @xmath80 .",
    "this agrees qualitatively with the following estimate .",
    "the deposition of the first particle in the valley bottom occurs with probability @xmath81 .",
    "this creates a fledgling loop , but one that is indistinguishable from the intermediate state in an elementary bcsos type growth event ( where a second particle is dropped on top of it with probability @xmath59 ) .",
    "the loop grows when the next particle is dropped not on top but next to the previous one . that happens with probability @xmath82 .",
    "the nucleation threshold diameter @xmath83 is reached when the loop growth and bcsos growth become distinguishable , i.e. , when the annihilation of a loop requires the creation of a new well distinguishable loop inside it .",
    "that happens at about @xmath84 , see fig.[1d_dyn]b .",
    "the time scale at which that stage is reached is approximately @xmath85 ( in bcsos time units ) , which is of the same order of magnitude as the above numerical nucleation time scale .",
    "the loop rises out of the valley until it becomes trapped on the ridge line that borders this valley to adjacent ones . from there on the loop is slaved to the growth fluctuations of the surface .",
    "valleys grow and shrink ( without bias ) , open - up , fill - up and merge .",
    "the loop has to follow this dance of the ridge line until a new loop nucleates out of the valley and annihilates it , or when the encircled terrain happens to shrink to zero ( fills - up ) by surface growth fluctuations .",
    "we expect that the life time @xmath86 of a ridge line of size @xmath87 in a growing surface , scales as a power law , @xmath88 , with @xmath89 the dynamic exponent of the surface roughness degrees of freedom ( kpz like in our model ) . to test this , we measure the decay times of large macroscopic defect loops ( of about half the lattice size ) as function of @xmath87 , at low temperatures @xmath90 .",
    "the data in fig.[timehis ] collapse indeed onto one universal curve after a rescaling of time by @xmath91 .",
    "the collapse fits best at @xmath92 ( in bcsos time units ) , which is consistent with the known kpz dynamic exponent @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the ridge line fluctuations are responsible for the power law tails in the time distribution of rr order , fig.[mhstgm ] .",
    "those critical fluctuations only show up below a characteristic length scale @xmath93 , where the nucleation time scale @xmath94 is larger than the surface growth time scale , @xmath95 .",
    "a simple estimate for @xmath0 follows from equating the two time scales , @xmath96 .",
    "the peaks in the susceptibility , in fig.[susclps ] , reflect this crossover length @xmath0 .",
    "recall that the peak shifts logarithmically . by setting @xmath97",
    "we obtain the same logarithmic behavior , @xmath98 .",
    "the prefactor is too small by about 30% , but this is not a surprise because the estimate is rather simple minded .",
    "it ignores for example the self similarity of the rough surface .",
    "consider a sub valley adjacent to an already trapped loop .",
    "suppose a new loop nucleates out of this subvalley .",
    "the loop segments annihilate each other in pairs .",
    "the net effect of this nucelation event is therefore that the trapped loop jumps across the sub valley .",
    "it now follows the complementary segment of the ridge line that encircles the sub valley .",
    "such events renormalize @xmath99 , in particular near @xmath70 .",
    "in this paper we study the compatibility of surface reconstruction and surface roughness during growth .",
    "there are several possibilities .    in surfaces where reconstructed rough ( rr ) phases are topologically forbidden , like missing row reconstructed fcc(110 ) facets ,",
    "the reconstruction order can not exist on a global scale in the stationary growing state .",
    "it can appear only locally within the crossover roughness length scale @xmath1 within which the surface grows in a layer - by - layer fashion , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "the reconstruction length scale @xmath0 can exceed @xmath1 , only in surfaces where equilibrium reconstructed rough phases are topologically possible , and those surfaces could in principle even display genuine deconstruction type phase transitions in the stationary growing state .",
    "we address this issue in the context of kpz type dynamics , in the rsos model with negative coupling constant @xmath32 , which in equilibrium has a checker board type rr phase and a true deconstruction phase transition inside the rough phase .",
    "we find that the stationary growing rough state lacks true macroscopic rr order ; @xmath0 remains finite .",
    "moreover , we identify the mechanism that sets the temperature dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "the fundamental features are an upward drift of the reconstruction domain wall loops and their trapping at the ridge lines of the surface . there , the loops are slaved to fluctuations of the surface growth dynamics .",
    "@xmath0 is set by the competition between two life times : the nucleation time scale of a new loop out of the valleys ( annihilating existing trapped loops ) and the time scale @xmath100 at which a ridge line of radius @xmath87 vanishes due to surface growth fluctuations .    at length scales smaller than @xmath101",
    ", the surface appears as reconstructed rough , and the life time of the loops is determined by the kpz growth dynamic fluctuations .",
    "the latter follow power laws .",
    "this manifests itself in critical fluctuations in the reconstruction order at length scales smaller than @xmath0 . in x - ray diffraction from such a growing interface",
    ", one would observe not only power law shaped peaks associated with the surface roughness , but also at temperatures where @xmath0 is larger than the coherence length of the surface , power law shaped reconstruction diffraction peaks .    at length scales larger than @xmath0",
    ", the surface appears as unreconstructed rough .",
    "loops of that size die by nucleation of new loops instead of kpz surface fluctuations , and they are not trapped anymore , because loop segments can hop across sub valleys of size @xmath102 by means of nucleation of new loops in sub valleys .    in our study",
    "we chose to focus on kpz type surface growth dynamics , but we have good reasons to expect that the trapping of domain walls on ridge lines is a common phenomenon . in general , the quasi - critical fluctuations will reflect the dynamic exponent of whatever growth dynamics is applicable . in recent studies of 1d models with kpz and ising type coupled degrees of freedom the ising defects become trapped in valleys and canyons and thus pin - down the growth  @xcite .",
    "we expect that a tendency towards facetting instead of ridge line trapping can also be realized in our 2d model by varying the local growth rates .",
