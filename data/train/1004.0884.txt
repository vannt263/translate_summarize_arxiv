    "the `` @xmath1 from @xmath2 '' supersymmetric standard model ( @xmath3ssm ) was proposed in ref . as an alternative to the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . in particular",
    ", it provides a solution to the @xmath1-problem @xcite of the mssm and explains the origin of neutrino masses by simply using right - handed neutrino superfields . since it was proposed @xcite , the @xmath3ssm has been studied in ref . - ( for a summary see ref . ) .",
    "the superpotential of the @xmath3ssm is given by@xcite :    [ superpotential ] w & = &  _ ab ( y_u^ij h_u^b q^a_i u_j^c + y_d^ij h_d^a q^b_i d_j^c + y_e^ij h_d^a l^b_i e_j^c + y_^ij h_u^b l^a_i ^c_j ) + & -&_ab ^i ^c_ih_d^a h_u^b + ^ijk ^c_i^c_j^c_k .    a @xmath4 symmetry could be evoked to forbid parameters with dimensions in the superpotential .",
    "this symmetry may have a clear origin if the lagrangian describes massless modes of a fundamental object ( with very massive modes , as in string theory ) .",
    "non - renormalizable contributions could lift this @xmath4 symmetry avoiding a possible domain wall problem without introducing hierarchy problems , in a similar way as in the nmssm case @xcite .",
    "working in the framework of gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking , the following soft terms appear in the lagrangian  @xcite ,    - _ & = & ( m_^2)^ij ^ * + ( m_u^c^2)^ij ^ * u^c_j + ( m_d^c^2)^ij ^ * d^c_j + ( m_^2)^ij ^ * + ( m_e^c^2)^ij ^ * e^c_j + & + & m_h_d^2 h^a_d^*h^a_d + m_h_u^2 h^a_u^ * h^a_u + ( m_^c^2)^ij ^ * ^c_j + & + & _ ab + + & - & ( m_3 _ 3 _ 3+m_2 _ 2 _ 2 + m_1 _ 1 _ 1 + ) . [ 2:vsoft ] let us recall that the only scale in the model is the susy breaking scale present in the above soft terms  @xcite .    once the electroweak symmetry is spontaneously broken , the neutral scalars develop in general the following vevs , @xmath5 .",
    "an effective @xmath1 term , @xmath6 , is generated from @xmath7 in the superpotential . in a similar way terms of the type @xmath8",
    "are generating an effective mayorana mass @xmath9 of electroweak order .",
    "note that the presence at the same time of the yukawa term for the neutrino and the last two terms in ( [ superpotential ] ) are breaking r - parity explicitly .",
    "since in this model r - parity is explicitly broken , the neutralino is not a possible candidate for dark matter ( and neither is the sneutrino ) . in this respect",
    "the gravitino as a dark matter candidate was studied in ref . , where a possible detection was discussed .",
    "the breaking of r - parity can easily be understood if we realize that in the limit where yukawas for neutrinos are vanishing , the @xmath10 are just ordinary singlet superfields , without any connection with neutrinos , and this model would coincide ( although with three instead of one singlet ) with the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) where r - parity is conserved .",
    "once we switch on the neutrino yukawa couplings , the fields @xmath10 become right - handed neutrino superfields , and , as a consequence , r - parity is broken .",
    "indeed this breaking is small because we have an electroweak - scale seesaw , implying neutrino yukawa couplings no larger than @xmath11 ( like the electron yukawa ) @xcite",
    ".    note that in principle the number of right - handed neutrinos is a free parameter .",
    "to fix the number we have followed in this work the philosophy that three families for all leptons is natural . with respect to this , the characteristics of the @xmath0ssm with different number of neutrinos have been discusses in ref . , where the case of only one right - handed neutrino is specially discussed .",
    "regarding the case of two right - handed neutrinos , which is the minimal number to generate the experimental pattern at tree level , it was pointed out in ref . that two is also the minimal number to have the possibility of spontaneous cp violation ( scpv ) . in the following",
    "we describe the seesaw mechanism in the @xmath0ssm .",
    "in the @xmath0ssm the mssm neutralinos mix with the left- and right - handed neutrinos as a consequence of r - parity violation . therefore the right - handed neutrinos behave as singlino components of the neutralinos . in the basis",
    "@xmath12 the neutralino - neutrino mass matrix was given in refs . and",
    "for real vevs , and in ref .",
    "for complex ones . for simplicity we work in the real case ,",
    "and then we have , @xmath13 where the mass matrix , @xmath14 , is , @xmath15 with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 the above matrix ( [ mneutralinos10x10 ] ) is of the seesaw type where the entries of @xmath14 are of the order of the electroweak scale while the ones in @xmath19 are of the order of the dirac masses for the neutrinos @xcite .",
    "therefore in a first approximation the effective neutrino mixing mass matrix can be written as , @xmath20 and one can diagonalize it by a unitary transformation ( ortonormal in the real case ) @xmath21    let us write an approximate analytical expression for the effective neutrino mass matrix of the @xmath0ssm neglecting all the terms containing @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , due to the smallness of @xmath25 and @xmath2 @xcite , and taking couplings @xmath26 , the tensor @xmath27 with terms @xmath28 and vanishing otherwise , diagonal yukawa couplings @xmath29 , and vevs @xmath30 . from ref .",
    "( also this coincides with the results of ref . )",
    "we have ,    @xmath31\\ ,     \\nonumber\\\\    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath32\\ . \\ ] ] here @xmath33 has been used , since @xmath34 @xcite , and also we have defined @xmath35 .    to clarify how the seesaw works in this model",
    "let us make three limits , making special emphasis in the last one .",
    "the first limit @xcite is the one where gauginos are very heavy and decouple ( i.e. @xmath36 ) , and then ( [ formula analitica real reescrita ] ) reduces to @xmath37 the effective mixing of the right - handed neutrinos and higgsinos in this limit produces off - diagonal entries in the mass matrix . besides , when right - handed neutrinos are also decoupled ( i.e. @xmath38 ) , the neutrino masses are zero as corresponds to the case of a seesaw with only higgsinos .",
    "the second limit @xcite which is worth discussing is @xmath39 .",
    "then , ( [ formula analitica real reescrita ] ) reduces to the form ( m_eff)_ij - .",
    "we can also see that for @xmath40 ( i.e. @xmath41 ) one obtains @xmath42 note that this result can actually be obtained if @xmath43 , as was noticed in ref . .",
    "it means that decoupling right - handed neutrinos / singlinos and higgsinos , the seesaw mechanism is generated through the mixing of left - handed neutrinos with gauginos .",
    "this is a characteristic feature of the seesaw in the well - known bilinear r - parity violation model ( brpv ) @xcite .",
    "notice that the gauginos ( bino and wino ) are in the adjoint representation , so they have a vector character , and ( [ gaugino see - saw ] ) could be associated to a type iii seesaw ) to a type iii seesaw was pointed out in ref . .",
    "] as ( [ not ordinary see - saw ] ) is associated to a type i. nevertheless we recall that there is an intrinsically supersymmetric character of this seesaw , since gauginos are part of gauge supermultiplets .",
    "the last limit @xcite we want to discuss gives a clear idea of the seesaw mechanism in this model .",
    "the seesaw in the @xmath3ssm comes , in general , from the interplay of the above two limits .",
    "namely , the limit where we suppress only certain higgsino and gaugino mixing .",
    "hence , taking @xmath40 in ( [ formula analitica real reescrita ] ) , we obtain @xmath44 as above , we remark that actually this result can be obtained if @xmath45 . the effective mass @xmath46 represents the mixing between gauginos and higgsinos-@xmath47 that is not completely suppressed in this limit . expression ( [ limit quasi no mixing higgsinos gauginos ] ) is more general than the other two limits studied above .",
    "notice that for typical values of the parameters involved in the seesaw,@xmath48 , and therefore we get a simple formula that can be used to understand the seesaw mechanism in this model in an qualitative way , that is @xmath49 the simplicity of ( [ limit no mixing higgsinos gauginos ] ) , in contrast with the full formula given by ( [ formula analitica real reescrita ] ) , comes from the fact that the mixing between gauginos and higgsinos-@xmath47 is neglected .",
    "in this model the effective neutrino mass matrix is not diagonal even for diagonal yukawas .",
    "following ref .",
    ", in the next section we show how to obtain the normal and inverted hierarchy , reproducing experimental masses and mixing angles , in an easy way , using diagonal yukawas .",
    "to continue the discussion of the seesaw in the @xmath3ssm , let us remind that two mass differences and mixing angles have been measured experimentally in the neutrino sector .",
    "the allowed @xmath50 ranges for these parameters are shown in table [ synopsis ] ( as discussed in ref . ) .",
    "we also show the compositions of the mass eigenstates in fig .",
    "[ imagenjerarquias ] for the normal and inverted hierarchy cases ( as shown in ref . ) .    due to the fact that the mass eigenstates have , in a good approximation , the same composition of @xmath51 and @xmath52 we start considering diagonal and degenerate yukawas in @xmath1 and @xmath53 , @xmath54 , also with @xmath55 .",
    "therefore ( [ limit no mixing higgsinos gauginos ] ) takes the form @xmath56    where @xmath57 the eigenvalues of this matrix are the following : @xmath58 and the corresponding eigenvectors ( for simplicity are not normalised ) are @xmath59 we have ordered the eigenvalues in such a way that it is clear how to obtain the normal hierarchy for the @xmath51-@xmath52 degenerate case",
    ". then we see that @xmath60 and @xmath61 , as in the bimaximal mixing regime .",
    "also we have enough freedom to fix the parameters in such a way that the experimental values for the mass differences and the remaining angle @xmath62 can be reproduced .",
    "it is important to mention that the above two values of the angles are a consequence of considering the example with @xmath51-@xmath52 degeneration , and therefore valid even if we use the general formula ( [ formula analitica real reescrita ] ) instead of the simplified expression ( [ limit no mixing higgsinos gauginos ] ) .",
    "notice that ( [ meff toy model ] ) , ( [ eigenvalues toy model ] ) and ( [ eigenvectors toy model ] ) would be the same but with the corresponding values of @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "let us finally remark that we can get the tri - bimaximal mixing regime , i.e. , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , fixing in ( [ meff toy model ] ) @xmath68 .",
    "in this way we obtain the eigenvalues @xmath69 it is important to note that , in this case , we need @xmath70 for the normal hierarchy case , otherwise the @xmath62 angle is zero instead of @xmath71 . in the inverted hierarchy scenario",
    "@xmath70 leads the angle @xmath62 to zero which is not phenomenologically viable",
    ". then we impose @xmath72 . in this way",
    "we obtain the eigenvalues , @xmath73 where for the normal case @xmath74 is the heaviest one and for the inverted case is the lightest one , as in fig [ imagenjerarquias ] .    breaking the degeneracy between the @xmath25 and @xmath2 for the muon and tau neutrinos , it is possible to find more general solutions in the normal and inverted hierarchy cases .",
    "here we have shown an example to reproduce the experiment , but more possibilities can be found in refs . and .",
    "it is remarkable that one could assume diagonal yukawas for the leptons , reproducing all the neutrinos masses and mixing angle . in other words ,",
    "the leptonic sector of this model has the ability to give large mixing angles using a simple diagonal structure for the yukawas . in a sense",
    ", the model gives an explanation of why the mixing angles of the quark and lepton sector are so different .",
    "the characteristics of the seesaw in this model can easily be understood from the limit ( [ limit no mixing higgsinos gauginos ] ) : r - parity is broken ( neutralinos are part of the seesaw ) and the only scale is the susy one @xcite .    *",
