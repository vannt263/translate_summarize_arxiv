    "faddeev s three - body work of 1960 @xcite , combined with the earlier two - body work of bethe and salpeter , and gell - mann and low@xcite , produced significant interest within the nuclear and particle physics communities in solving the fully relativistic three - body problem @xcite .",
    "calculations based upon the full four - dimensional theory , however , have proved very difficult , and have only recently been performed by rupp and tjon using separable interactions @xcite .    in the meantime ,",
    "three - dimensional nonrelativistic calculations based upon the schrdinger equation have progressed significantly . using @xmath0 potentials which provide a good description of two - body data ,",
    "recent calculations have been performed to a precision of 10  kev @xcite .",
    "given the successes of these nonrelativistic calculations in obtaining excellent precision , discrepancies with experiment of order 10  kev or larger are due to inaccuracies in the theoretical input rather than uncertainties in the calculations .",
    "the main `` missing physics '' in these calculations are three - body forces and relativistic effects .",
    "a recent calculation found the triton to be underbound by roughly 480860  kev @xcite .",
    "a recent assessment of the triton potential energy suggested that a consistent relativistic calculation could account for as much as 300 kev of repulsion ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) ; however , recent relativistic calculations using the blankenbecler - sugar formalism and the cd - bonn potential showed an _ increased _ binding of 200 kev @xcite .",
    "the size of the relativistic effects determines the amount of three - body interaction that would therefore be required .",
    "a consistent relativistic three - nucleon calculation is needed in order to permit some understanding of the respective roles of relativistic effects and three - body forces in nuclear binding .    in view of the successes of the nonrelativistic calculations and",
    "the need for relativistic calculations , many three - dimensional reductions of the relativistic four - dimensional bethe - salpeter equation have been made following the two - body work of blankenbecler and sugar , and logunov and tavkhelidze @xcite .",
    "this approach , often called the quasipotential approach , consists of replacing the bethe - salpeter equation with a set of two coupled equations .",
    "these equations involve two new functions , the quasipotential @xmath1 and the quasipotential green s function @xmath2 .",
    "we may choose one of these functions arbitrarily .",
    "the requirement that these equations be equivalent to the bethe - salpeter equation then fixes the other function .",
    "traditionally , the quasipotential green s function @xmath2 is chosen to contain a dirac @xmath3  function constraint which reduces the dimensionality of one of the new equations .",
    "difficulties with this procedure arise when the equation for the quasipotential @xmath1 is truncated .",
    "what form these difficulties take is dependent upon the form of the constraint used in the quasipotential green s function .",
    "for example , in the gross equation @xcite this truncation introduces into the wave function unphysical singularities which must be removed by hand . in the instant formalism @xcite , singularities arise when attempting the dynamical boost of the wave function .",
    "although they take different forms , the root cause of these difficulties is the @xmath3  function constraint combined with the truncation of the quasipotential .",
    "given the difficulties with solving the full four - dimensional equation , the success of the nonrelativistic three - dimensional calculations , and the fundamental problems in the quasipotential approach , a different technique for dimensional reduction seems warranted .",
    "in this paper we develop an approach to the relativistic three - body problem , with an emphasis on three - body bound states .",
    "we start from the bethe - salpeter equation for the full three - body green s function in momentum space . for definiteness , we use scalar meson exchange as a model for the interaction ; extension to other forms of interactions is straightforward .",
    "negative energy states are omitted as the dominant physics is obtained from positive energy states .",
    "we perform a fourier transformation of the zeroth component of all internal momenta to relative - time variables , and carry out the relative - time integrations , which has the effect of transforming each feynman graph into several time - ordered graphs .",
    "these time - ordered graphs are three - dimensional in nature .",
    "rearranging and summing graphs produces an expression for the full , four - dimensional , three - body green s function in which all of the internal variables are three dimensional .",
    "it follows that the bound - state equation is three dimensional as well .",
    "we find that the propagator consists of a pre - factor in which the relative energies are fixed by the initial state of the particles , an intermediate part in which only global propagation of the particles occurs , and a post - factor in which relative energies are fixed by the final state of the particles .",
    "the pre- and post - factors are necessary in order to account for the transition from states where particles are off their mass shell to states described by the global propagator with all of the particle energies on shell .",
    "this formalism allows calculations of bound states in three - dimensions ( where much success has been shown ) and provides the formalism for embedding the result within a four - dimensional covariant scattering theory .    in sec .",

    "each contribution can be decomposed into a sequence of time intervals between consecutive meson emission and absorption events .",
    "the integral over the time duration of each such interval may be performed analytically to produce the time - ordered perturbation theory ( topt ) rules and corresponding graphs ( see appendix [ sec : topt ] ) .    in order to provide a few examples , consider subgraphs that contain no initial or final particle lines ,",
    "i.e. , that are embedded within other graphs such that interactions separate them from initial or final particle lines .",

    "there are six time - ordered diagrams corresponding to a single cross - box feynman graph , differing by the time ordering of vertices on one particle line with respect to those on the other particle line .",

    "consider the simple , iterative feynman ( four - dimensional ) diagram shown at the left of fig .  [ fig : reclassify ] .    the reduction from four to three dimensions produces 12 time - ordered diagrams , the sum of the first four being the iteration of the two - body force .",
    "the other eight , however , do not have the requisite time interval with only the three particles propagating , and are hence three - particle irreducible .",

    "this sum may then be separated and factored .",
    "first , we take cluster separability into account , and then we factor the connected three - body term into three pieces .",
    "cluster separability @xcite means that a green s function describing the propagation of clusters of particles , when there are no interactions between the clusters , consists of a product of independent factors , one for each cluster .",
    "each cluster s factor is the same as if the other clusters were not present . for three particles",
