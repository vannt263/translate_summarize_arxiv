    "the most massive globular clusters ( gcs ) ( mass @xmath10  @xmath7 ) in galaxies are found to be different from the rest of the gc population in their physical , chemical and dynamical properties @xcite .",
    "these massive clusters seem to be related to the higher mass compact systems such as nuclear clusters @xcite and ultra - compact dwarfs ( ucds ) @xcite rather than to the lower - mass classical gcs .",
    "thus , it seems unlikely that the massive gcs were formed _ in - situ _ in the halos of their present parent galaxies , like their lower mass counterparts . meanwhile , there is growing evidence in support of the idea proposed by @xcite , that was later tested using numerical simulations by @xcite , that some of the massive compact objects could be left - over nuclei of tidally stripped dwarf galaxies .",
    "well - known examples of these type of clusters are @xmath8  cen  in our galaxy @xcite , mayall ii ( g1 ) in m31 @xcite , and several massive gcs in ngc5128 @xcite",
    ".    the brightest gc in a galaxy would also be the most massive if it is old like most gcs .",
    "gcs in elliptical galaxies all seem to be older than 10  gyr @xcite , the exception being the gas - rich elliptical ngc1316 which contains intermediate - age ( 310  gyr ) gcs @xcite .",
    "however , there is clear evidence of gc - like objects forming at present epochs in gas - rich spirals that have experienced merging ( e.g. antennae : * ? ? ?",
    "even mild interactions are able to trigger the formation of massive compact objects such as the case of m82 , which has formed a population of compact clusters in its disk following its interaction with m81 around 500  myr ago @xcite .",
    "it is not yet established whether this interaction or a similar interaction in the past was able to form any massive compact clusters in m81 , that would have observational properties of old gcs .    in a systematic search for compact clusters in m81",
    "using the hst / acs images , @xcite identified r05r06584 ( gc1 henceforth ; ra=09:55:22.042 @xmath1169:06:37.84 ( j2000 ) ) as the brightest among the 172 gcs in this galaxy . it was noted in that work that the cluster is more luminous than the brightest gcs in the milky way ( @xmath8  cen ) and andromeda ( m31-g1 ) , the only two galaxies of comparable mass that are closer to us than m81 .",
    "gc1 is seen at a projected galactocentric distance of only 3.0  kpc , as compared to galactocentric distances of 6.3  kpc , and 40  kpc of @xmath8 cen and m31-g1 , respectively .",
    "the object had been previously identified as 50777 in @xcite and was the target of a spectroscopic study by @xcite ( their object 1029 ) , who reported a metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath12 .",
    "they calculated this metallicity using emperical relations between lick indices and metallicity @xcite .",
    "they also reported a radial velocity of @xmath13  kms@xmath14 , which is consistent with radial velocity obtained for disk objects at the observed galacto - centric distance of gc1 .    in spite of being the brightest gc in m81",
    ", the nature of gc1 is unknown .",
    "if it is an old gc like @xmath8  cen or m31-g1 , it would be the most massive gc not only in m81 , but also in the local universe ( distance @xmath15  mpc ) .",
    "on the other hand , if it was formed later on , its mass would be smaller .",
    "determination of its age is critical to distinguish these two possibilities .",
    "the cluster is not resolved into individual stars even on the hst / acs images , and hence age can not be obtained using the classical technique of colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) . in this paper , we determine the age using two independent methods : ( 1 ) by fitting the optical spectrum between 36007000    with a model spectrum that is constructed as a sum of several single stellar populations ( ssps ) using the code starlight , and ( 2 ) by fitting the uv to mir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) with ssps of fixed ages .",
    "the latter method is very powerful in inferring the presence of intermediate - age populations @xcite . in table",
    "[ tab : superclusters ] , we compare the absolute magnitude ( @xmath16 ) , metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) , @xmath17 colour at the cluster center , age , mass , central @xmath18-band surface brightness ( @xmath19 ) , and the structural parameters of gc1 to the corresponding parameters in @xmath8  cen and m31-g1 .",
    "the tabulated masses are photometric masses .",
    "two additional values of masses are given for m31-g1 inside parentheses , both obtained using dynamical methods by @xcite , the smaller one is the virial mass and the larger one is the king mass .    in  2 , we describe observational data used in this work .",
    "the method we adopted to obtain the structural properties is given in  3 . in  4 , we describe the analysis technique we have used to obtain the metallicity , age , extinction and mass of gc1 .",
    "the nature and the origin of gc1 are discussed in  5 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      +",
    "we used the iraf / stsdas software package _ ellipse _ to analyse the structural parameters of gc1 in the hst images .",
    "_ ellipse _ is an algorithm designed to fit isophotes of galaxies with ellipses , where the intensity profiles decrease monotonically with radius .",
    "the first requirement of the analysis is to establish the best photometric centroid for the cluster .",
    "we started with the reported position of gc1 in @xcite , which is the centroid defined by sextractor @xcite .",
    "we refined this centre by re - calculating the centre as the average centre of ellipses with semi - major axis @xmath20  pixels .",
    "the resulting centre differed from that reported by @xcite by less than 1 pixel .",
    "however , we obtained surface brightness profiles by fixing the centre at this newly obtained value .",
    "other quantities that affect the analysis of structural parameters are the choice of the background level and the range of radius used for fitting .",
    "we estimated the local background around gc1 in small ( @xmath21  pixel@xmath22 ) boxes , and defined the fitting radius as the semi - major axis where the azimuthally averaged intensity reaches the previously measured background level .",
    "the cluster is devoid of any major contaminating sources in its immediate vicinity within 3  radius that is considered in the analysis of the profiles  the nearest contaminating star is of @xmath23  mag ( vegamag ) at a radial distance of 326 ( 66 pixels ) from the cluster centre .",
    "finally , we subtracted the background value from the azimuthally averaged intensity profiles to obtain sky subtracted profiles in @xmath24 and @xmath25 bands .",
    "we also analysed the variation of ellipticity ( @xmath26 ) and the position angle of the major axis ( pa ) of the cluster for increasingly larger ellipses of fixed centres .",
    "the variation of @xmath27 and the pa as a function of semi - major axis length in @xmath24 and @xmath25 bands are shown in figure  [ fig : gc1pa ] .",
    "the pa and @xmath27 in the two filters remain almost constant between 520  pixels , at values of pa=@xmath28  and @xmath29 .",
    "the values in the inner - most two pixels are limited by resolution and hence the observed differences in the two bands are not significant .",
    "the cluster is elongated almost along the perpendicular direction to the semi - major axis of the parent galaxy .",
    "the dynamical history of star clusters can be investigated through the analysis of their surface brightness profiles .",
    "it is well known that surface brightness profiles of most gcs in the milky way , m31 and m33 are reasonably well represented by the king model profile @xcite .",
    "consequently , we fit the radial intensity profile of gc1 with an empirical king model @xcite after convolving it with the psf of the image in each filter .",
    "the characteristic psf was derived using the photometry routine iraf / daophot using selected isolated stars uniformly distributed over the entire hst images that contain the gc1 star cluster in @xmath24 and @xmath25 bands .",
    "the procedure we followed to realize the fits is identical to that in ishape @xcite , except that our procedure allows the determination of the tidal radius @xmath30 directly from the fits .    the observed surface brightness profiles of cg1 in @xmath24 and @xmath25 bands are shown in figure  [ fig : gc1prof ] . superposed on these observed profiles are the best fitting king model profiles ( after convolving with the image psfs ) .",
    "these models have core radius @xmath31  pix and tidal radius @xmath32  pix for the @xmath24 band , and @xmath33  pix and @xmath34  pix for the @xmath25 band .",
    "whereas the king profile fits very well the observed profile over the entire plotted range in the @xmath25 band , the observed @xmath24-band central surface brightness is @xmath35  mag brighter than that for the best - fit king profile .",
    "this apparent `` blue core '' is also seen in the colour profile ( top panel ) , which is most likely related to the presence of blue horizontal branch stars that also produces an uv excess as discussed in  4.3 .",
    "thus , it is advisable not to use the blue - band profiles for obtaining structural parameters .",
    "hence , we used the @xmath33  pix ( 1.2  pc ) and @xmath34  pix ( 93  pc ) for the @xmath25-band as typical values for gc1 .",
    "this results in a value of @xmath36 .",
    "the _ ellipse _ task also performs photometry in successive ellipses .",
    "we used these photometric data to determine @xmath37 , the radius where the aperture flux is half the total flux ( also known as half - light radius @xmath38 ) , in each of the two bands .",
    "the @xmath37 in the @xmath25 band is 5.6  pc .",
    "we also fitted a moffatt model profile in both the filters .",
    "the king model fits the profiles better , especially in the outer parts .",
    "@xcite derived a metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath12 for gc1 using empirical calibration of the indices defined by @xcite and @xcite for galactic gcs @xcite .",
    "their value is the weighted mean of [ fe / h ] values derived using indices mgh , mg2 , mgb , f25270 , fe5335 , fe5406 , g4300 , @xmath40 and cnr , with more weights given to indices with larger dynamic range , defined as the ratio of sensitivity of the index ( a change of 1 dex in [ fe / h ] ) to the observational error of the index .",
    "such a weighting scheme does nt foresee variations of [ @xmath41 in gcs and hence would give erroneous values of [ fe / h ] for systems that have [ @xmath41 values different from the mean value for the galactic sample .",
    "the relatively large error in their measured value is an indicator of dispersion in the measured abundances using different indices .",
    "low signal - to - noise ratio of their spectra may also be responsible for the large scatter .",
    "we used our gtc spectra of gc1 to improve the value of [ fe / h ] and also to newly determine the [ @xmath41 .",
    "we measured the indices fe5270 , fe5335 and fe5406 and determined the [ fe / h ] as the mean of metallicities obtained from each of these indices as is illustrated in figure  [ fig : metal ] .",
    "the [ fe / h ] vs index data for the galactic gcs of @xcite ( dots ) is fitted with a polynomial of second order ( solid line ) to obtain a new empirical calibration .",
    "note that the fits clearly illustrate the quadratic nature of the relation , though it is a common practice to fit these points with a straight line ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "observed values of indices for gc1 are plotted at the [ fe / h ] values inferred from our empirical calibration , with the shaded area denoting our mean value of [ fe / h]@xmath42 .",
    "the [ fe / h ] reported by @xcite is shown by the filled square along with their error on the left most panel .",
    "their large error bar is due to the use of non - iron indices to measure [ fe / h ] , and also the use of linear fits between indices and [ fe / h ] .",
    "if we use our calibration of the three iron indices with the index values reported by them ( table 4 & table 5 in their paper ) , we obtain [ fe / h]@xmath43 which is in agreement with values from our spectra .",
    "we also used the spectrum of gc1 to measure the lick indices ratio mgb/@xmath44fe@xmath45 @xcite , where @xmath44fe@xmath46 , and obtained the @xmath39 element enhancement using the relation of @xcite .",
    "this gives us a value of @xmath47=0.20\\pm0.05 $ ] .",
    "adopting the relation of @xcite between the indices and metallicity , our observed values of [ fe / h ] and @xmath47 $ ] correspond to @xmath48 for the commonly used value of @xmath49 .",
    "however , for the recently revised value of @xmath50 @xcite , we get @xmath51 .",
    "we analysed our gtc spectrum of gc1 to determine the age of the stellar population , using the    starlight    spectral synthesis code @xcite .",
    "as a first step , we corrected the observed spectrum for galactic extinction of @xmath52 ( maps of @xcite and the reddening curve of @xcite , using @xmath53 ) .",
    "the spectrum was then brought to the rest frame wavelength , and also was resampled to pixels of 1  between 3600 and 7000 .",
    "the    starlight    decomposes an observed spectrum in to a number of simple stellar populations ( ssps ) , each of which contributes a fraction @xmath54 to the flux at a chosen normalization wavelength ( in our case @xmath55 = 4020   ) .",
    "we used 24 ssps at a fixed metallicity of @xmath56 , the value closest to that observed in gc1 for which ssps are available in    starlight    ) .",
    "the ssps were extracted from the models of @xcite , computed for a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) , `` _",
    "padova-1994 _ ''",
    "evolutionary tracks @xcite , and stelib library of observed stellar spectra @xcite .",
    "the ages of these ssps range from 1  myr to 14 gyr , at approximately logarithmic steps .",
    "bad pixels and emission lines are masked and left out of the fits .",
    "the results of the    starlight    analysis are shown in figure  [ fig : starfit ] .",
    "all the characteristics of the observed spectrum are very well reproduced by the fit , with the residuals well below 10% in most parts of the spectrum . in spite of using ssps of 24 ages ,",
    "we find nearly 98% of the stellar mass corresponding to stars that formed at the very early epochs of galaxy formation ( age @xmath4  gyr ) with an age spread @xmath57  gyr .",
    "the best - fit model suggests that around 20% of the blue light comes from another population  1  gyr old population of @xmath58% of total mass . in the next section , using the fits to the entire sed , we will show that the source of this blue excess is most likely , the extreme blue horizontal branch stars , that are not taken into account in the base ssps in    starlight    , rather than a 1  gyr old population .",
    "thus , the optical spectrum of gc1 is consistent with an age of @xmath5913  gyr .",
    "the effects of the presence of dusty circumstellar envelopes around asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars appear at wavelengths longward of a few microns and leave a clear excess around @xmath60 @xmath61 m in the integrated mid - infrared ( mir ) spectrum of passively evolving systems @xcite . since agb stars are luminous tracers of intermediate - age stellar populations , the presence or not of their characteristic mir excess has been suggested as a powerful method to disentangle age and metallicity effects among these systems @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the analysis of ssp models accounting for the effects of dusty agb stars @xcite shows that a degeneracy between metallicity and age persists even in the mir , since both age and metallicity affect mass - loss and evolutionary lifetimes on the agb .",
    "while in the optical regime , age and metallicity need to be anti - correlated to maintain a feature unchanged ( either colour or narrow - band index ) , in the mir it is the opposite : the larger mass loss of a higher metallicity simple stellar population ( ssp ) must be balanced by its older age .",
    "therefore , the detailed comparison of the mir and optical data of passively evolving systems constitutes perhaps one of the cleanest ways to remove the degeneracy .",
    "the third parameter in the problem of the degeneracy is the extinction . in recent years , several studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that the analysis of photometric data from the uv to the nir spectral range help to disentangle the effects of reddening from those of evolution . however , they note that the derived metallicities do not reach the accuracies achievable by using spectroscopic data .",
    "in this section , we follow the approach of the analysis of the panchromatic sed , with the innovation of having a wider spectral range , from the uv to the mir , and by comparing these data with suitable ssp models accounting for the effects of dusty agb stars @xcite .",
    "notice that the photometric data reported in table  2 correspond to fluxes integrated over the entire cluster , which ensures reliable results from the analysis of sed .    as a first step",
    ", we corrected the observed sed for galactic extinction of @xmath52 , and the reddening curve of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the library of ssp model spectra were computed using the latest release of the parsec evolutionary tracks @xcite .",
    "the models cover an age range from 1 myr to several gigayears , and span a wide range of metallicities .",
    "the models use a salpeter s initial mass function between 0.15 and 120  m@xmath62 . in order to compare",
    "the galactic extinction corrected data with the models , we construct a grid of synthetic fluxes in all the bands listed in table  2 by integrating each model ssp spectrum over the corresponding filter responses , and then dividing by the area of the response curves . in order to obtain the internal extinction from the sed analysis",
    ", the synthetic broad band fluxes were then reddened using the cardelli law @xcite for a range of @xmath63 values .",
    "the best fit is obtained by minimizing the merit function @xmath64 , calculated as @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 are the reddened ssp flux values , the observed galactic extinction corrected fluxes and observational errors , respectively .",
    "n is the number of bands used in the calculation of @xmath64 .",
    "the upper - limit at the 24  @xmath61 m band is not used in our fits .    in figure",
    "[ fig : seddeg ] we show the results of this analysis .",
    "the points ( blue ) correspond to the galactic extinction - corrected data , while different lines represent different possible solutions that we have in our library .",
    "the first thing to note is that none of our ssp models can simultaneously fit the uv and the mir part of the spectrum .",
    "only very young ( age@xmath69  myr ) , high metallicity ( @xmath70 ) , and highly reddened ( @xmath71  mag ) models can reproduce the uv data ( dash - dotted line ) .",
    "however , the reddening corresponding to @xmath72 mag in these models produces an emission at ir wavelengths very much in excess of the mir data .",
    "notice that the ssp shown in figure [ fig : seddeg ] does nt include the reprocessed light corresponding to the absorption of @xmath71  mag , inclusion of which will further widen the gap between this model and the observed sed at mir wavelengths .",
    "if uv data are not considered in the analysis , the best fit corresponds to an old ( formal age@xmath73  gyr ) , relatively metal - poor ( @xmath74 ) and dust - free ( @xmath75  mag ) ssp model ( green solid line ) . for the sake of completeness ,",
    "if we restrict the sed to fit only the optical to nir bands , apart from the above solution , equally good fits are obtained for a younger ( age@xmath76  gyr ) , but slightly metal - rich ( @xmath56 ) ssp with no reddening required , clearly illustrating the effect of the degeneracy between age and metallicity ( blue dashed line ) . however , even in this case , the model produces an excess emission in the mir part of the spectrum due to the dusty circumstellar envelopes around agb stars , where the typical silicates emission feature clearly appears at @xmath77 m .",
    "the analysis of ssp models that account for dusty circumstellar envelopes show that this feature gets stronger at increasing metallicity ( and/or at intermediate ages ) , due to the correspondingly higher dust - mass - loss rate of the ssps . on the other hand",
    ", the feature vanishes at very low metallicity and/or at very old ages .",
    "therefore , the use of the mir data and , more importantly , the upper limit at 24@xmath61 m , rules out an age as young as 5  gyr , and favours old ages and close to zero internal extinction .",
    "it is the combined optical to mir analysis what ultimately breaks the age - metallicity degeneration and favours very old ( @xmath45 13 gyr ) and moderately metal - poor ( z@xmath78 0.004 ) ssp models .",
    "this result is further illustrated in the @xmath79 vs @xmath80 $ ] diagram ( figure  [ fig : optnircol ] ) , where the observed colours of gc1 ( shown by the asterisk ) indicate an age @xmath81  gyr and metallicity @xmath82 .",
    "however , none of the above models fit the galex ( and the sdss-@xmath83 ) fluxes .",
    "the ssp flux in the uv is more than an order of magnitude lower than the observed galex fluxes , establishing clearly the presence of uv excess .",
    "this uv excess is an already known issue in massive gcs(e.g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "blue horizontal branch stars ( bhbs ) are established to be the main reason for the uv excess in gcs . in canonical models of population synthesis for gcs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , bhbs naturally appear in old , very metal - poor systems , whereas metal - rich systems have only red clump stars .",
    "gc1 is not metal - poor , and hence we expect only the red clump , and no uv excess , especially using the recently downward revised calibration of the mass - loss rates during the red giant branch @xcite .",
    "however , this problem is not unique to gc1  many massive , relatively metal - rich galactic gcs are found to have hot bhbs @xcite .",
    "@xcite found these hot bhbs to contain an enhanced amount of helium . a second stellar generation with almost equal metallicity , but he - enriched , is nowadays the most likely explanation for the presence of the hot horizontal branch in galactic gcs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in order to check the possibility that the uv excess could be explained by accounting for the presence of a he - rich stellar population , we calculated a new set of ssp models for an enhanced value of initial he content . in more detail , we use parsec code to compute models for the same metallicity of the fit ( @xmath84 ) , ages between 9 to 14 gyr , and an initial he content equal to @xmath85 , a value that produces entire range of observed @xmath86  k for the hb stars @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that these models are fully consistent with the ones computed previously by adopting the canonical value of @xmath87 , as far as both the physical inputs and numerical assumptions are concerned .",
    "we re - did the fit , now accounting for data from fuv to irac4 bands , and where @xmath88 is a combination of the two sets of ssps ( one with the canonical y value , and the other with @xmath85 ) , using @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the fraction of the he - rich population needed to fit the total sed .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sedhestar ] , we show the comparison between the observational data ( blue points ) , the best fit ( red solid line , and red squares ) , and the previous best fit corresponding to the canonical he abundance ( green thin solid line ) . as already discussed , the models computed by assuming a canonical he content ( @xmath91 ) are not able to reproduce the uv excess . by contrast , the presence of two stellar populations with similar ages and metallicities , but markedly distinct initial he content , reproduce the entire sed of gc1 . the main population corresponding again to an age of @xmath9214.0 gyr , a metallicity of @xmath74 and the population with canonical he content contributes around 60% to the bolometric luminosity , while the he rich population corresponding to an ssp of 13.2 gyr and a metallicity of @xmath74 , contributes 40% ( @xmath93 ) to the total luminosity .",
    "this result is in agreement with the results by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they found that significant fractions , ranging between 3560% of a he - rich stellar population , are needed in order to explain the morphology and the observational features of the hbs of ngc  6441 and ngc  6388 .",
    "moreover , by comparing the best models with and without a he - rich population ( red vs. green lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : sedhestar ] ) , one can see that the impact of the inclusion of the he - rich population is almost negligible at wavelengths longer than the @xmath94-band ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the sed - inferred metallicity of @xmath74 is in good agreement with that inferred from our analysis of lick indices ( @xmath51 ; see  4.1 ) , putting gc1 clearly among the high metallicity gcs .",
    "the - sed inferred age ( @xmath95  gyr ) and the presence of second generation of bluer stars are also in good agreement with the star formation history inferred using starlight .",
    "our analysis indicates that the inferred initial mass of gc1 is about @xmath96 m@xmath97 , 40% of which are enriched in he content . the inferred number of he - rich bhb stars ( t@xmath98  k ) is @xmath99 which produce a bolometric luminosity of about @xmath100 . @xcite detected 1957 fuv bright sources in the massive galactic cluster @xmath8 centauri , of which over 30% are extreme hb stars or hot post - agb stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite , using the star counting technique , found 146 and 218 bhb stars in ngc 6441 and ngc 6388 , respectively , two massive ( @xmath101 m@xmath97 ) , old ( @xmath10213  gyr ) and metal - rich ( @xmath103\\thickapprox -0.5 $ ] ) bulge globular clusters .",
    "@xcite used the broad - band ( fuv to nir ) sed fitting technique in g1 in m31 , and found also a uv excess which would correspond to @xmath104 fuv - bright , hot , extreme hb stars , which is more than 3 order of magnitude lower than the results we got for gc1 , even though m31-g1 has a similar mass as gc1 .",
    "however , we note that m31-g1 is metal - poor by more than a factor of 2 as compared to gc1 .",
    "on the other hand , note that gc1 , ngc  6441 , ngc  6388 and even @xmath8 centauri are massive and metal - rich globular clusters ( @xmath105 ) , and only a he - rich old stellar population could give a significantly higher number of hot , evolved hb stars , as compared to the he - poor counterparts of the same age and lower metallicity ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the presence of he - rich stellar populations have also been proposed by @xcite to explain the uv emission of uv - bright clusters in m87 .",
    "as far as the authors know , gc1 could be the cluster with the largest number of he - rich bhb stars .",
    "we would like to point out , and it is easy to see in fig .",
    "[ fig : sedhestar ] , that the best fit ( red solid line ) model under - produces emission at the nuv with respect to the observed data , most likely indicating that the bhb stars in our models are too hot .",
    "it is well established that the bluest hb stars are cooler at lower he enhancement values ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , it is likely that the he enhancement in gc1 is not as high as @xmath85 , but @xmath106 . determining the exact value of @xmath107 is beyond the scope of this work , as it also depends on the mass - loss efficiency during the red giant evolution .",
    "the presence of he - enriched stellar population would imply that gc1 must have had at least two episodes of star formation with the second generation of stars polluted by material ejected from the first generation of stars .",
    "the stars responsible for the pollution could be type ii supernovae , rotating massive stars or massive - agb stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the nature of the progenitor and how the ejected material can remain inside the potential well will be discussed in  5 .    given that the presence of a small fraction of he - enriched stars can give rise to an uv excess ,",
    "it is not advisable to use uv fluxes while fitting seds to obtain age and metallicity of old simple populations .",
    "ignoring the he - enriched stars in clusters with intrinsic uv excess would lead to overestimates of ages such as found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the derived photometric mass of @xmath96  @xmath7  corresponds to the mass at birth of the cluster using the salpeter imf ( see  4.3 ) . at the present age of @xmath108  gyr ,",
    "the cluster still contains 65% of the initial mass ( 51% in living stars , and 14% in stellar remnants ) .",
    "thus , the present mass of the cluster with the salpeter imf is @xmath6  @xmath7 . with the @xcite imf ,",
    "the present mass would be @xmath109  @xmath7 .",
    "the derived mass is comparable to the photometric mass of m31-g1 ( see table  1 ) , whereas it is @xmath110 times more than that of @xmath8  cen , the brightest gc in the milky way . in this section ,",
    "we analyse whether this cluster shares properties that are established to be characteristics of massive gcs , and address the issue of its origin .",
    "the relatively high concentration index of @xmath111 suggests that the cluster is in a post - core collapse stage , where binaries at the centre of the cluster provide a source of energy to halt the collapse .",
    "the gc1 is expected to harbour a number of close low - mass binaries , which are expected to emit x - rays .",
    "the brightest gcs in galaxies are known to be x - ray emitters ( e.g. @xcite in ngc 4472 ; @xcite in ngc 4278 ) , where the low - mass x - ray binaries are responsible for the x - ray emission .",
    "the x - ray missions rosat and chandra , both have detected x - ray emission from gc1 @xcite , with the latter reporting an x - ray luminosity of @xmath112erg  s@xmath14 .",
    "the observed luminosity of gc1 corresponds to a system of a binary where the donor is an evolved giant star @xcite .",
    "the cluster is at a projected distance of only 3.0  kpc from the nucleus of the galaxy .",
    "we now calculate the expected tidal radius of gc1 , using the relation given by @xcite : + @xmath113 , + where @xmath114  kpc is the galactocentric radius of gc1 , @xmath115  @xmath7  is the mass of gc1 , and @xmath116 is the mass of the parent galaxy within the radius @xmath117 .",
    "@xcite estimate a mass of @xmath118  @xmath7  within a galactocentric radius of 3.82  kpc .",
    "substituting these values , we get a tidal radius of 116  pc .",
    "the observed @xmath119  pc in the @xmath120-band is 80% of this value .",
    "thus , the dynamical evolution of gc1 is not being affected by the tidal forces of the parent galaxy , unless the cluster is in a highly eccentric orbit and that it had a peri - centre radius as small as 2.0  kpc .",
    "the fact that the observed radial velocity of gc1 is consistent with that expected at the present radius , possibly rules out the object being in a highly eccentric orbit .    in a recent work ,",
    "@xcite divided the galactic gcs into two categories  the expansion - dominated and evaporation - dominated .",
    "gcs in the first category are massive ones that are evolving without the tidal effects of the parent galaxy , resulting in the increase of their half - mass radius with time .",
    "the gcs in the second category are tidally limited , resulting in evaporation , and subsequent contraction .",
    "the observed mass of gc1 clearly puts it in the first category .",
    "if we extrapolate the @xmath121-mass relation that @xcite obtained for the galactic gcs to the mass of gc1 , we obtain an @xmath122  pc , which is around 4 times smaller as compared to the observed value .",
    "thus , gc1 is in the expansion - dominated phase .",
    "colour distribution of gcs shows bimodality , which is principally due to a metallicity difference between two old populations @xcite , with the metal - poor ( @xmath103 < -1 $ ] ) gcs being relatively bluer than their metal - rich counterparts .",
    "gc1 is metal - rich @xmath103 = -0.60\\pm0.10 $ ] , and moderately @xmath39-enriched ( [ @xmath1\\sim0.2\\pm0.05 $ ] ) .",
    "star formation episodes extending for more than @xmath123  gyr are not expected to show @xmath39 enrichment , and hence the observed value of [ @xmath124 rules out extended period of star formation .",
    "thus , star formation and metal enrichment in this cluster should have happened over this short time - scale .",
    "this implies that the cluster was efficient in retaining all or most of metals ejected in the initial burst .",
    "metals are expelled from stars in the form of high velocity winds of high mass stars , through explosion of snii , and through the winds of agb stars . with the inferred photometric mass of @xmath6  @xmath7 , and a concentration parameter of @xmath125",
    ", we estimate an escape velocity at the tidal radius of 146  kms@xmath14 at present , using the expression given by @xcite . given that the initial cluster mass is expected to be higher , and the @xmath38 lower than the presently observed values",
    ", the escape velocities during the first gigayear of star formation would have been higher than this value .",
    "terminal velocity of winds in agbs of stars of metallicities",
    "@xmath103 = -0.60 $ ] is expected to be around 50  kms@xmath14 , whereas the velocity of winds from high - mass stars , and supernova ejecta would be much higher than the escape velocities . however , the cluster potential was deep enough to trap metals from agb winds , resulting in enrichment of the interstellar medium before the star formation ceased . the potential",
    "well , however , was not deep enough to trap all the metals generated in the cluster .",
    "trapping of metal - enriched gas also leads to the formation of helium enriched second generation of stars , that at present show up as blue hb stars .",
    "the sed of the cluster , especially the flux in the galex bands , clearly suggests an extended blue hb , consisting of @xmath5 stars .",
    "gc1 is clearly one of the most massive clusters in the local universe . ever since the success of the numerical simulations of @xcite in explaining the observed properties of @xmath8  cen , massive gcs are often considered as nuclei of stripped dwarf galaxies .",
    "we here discuss whether gc1 also fits into this picture .",
    "kormendy s classical work @xcite led to the use of observational planes formed from two or more of the following four quantities  central or mean surface brightness , core or half - light radius , total absolute magnitude and central velocity dispersions  to address the inter - relation between different spheroidal systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite used the @xmath121 vs @xmath126 diagram to address the origin of gcs that have hot bhbs .",
    "more recently , @xcite and @xcite have used this diagram to illustrate the continuity of properties of different spheroidal systems . in figure",
    "[ fig : sizelum ] , we show the @xmath121 vs @xmath126 diagram , where data for gc1 are plotted along with those for other spheroidal systems .",
    "data for galactic and extragalactic gcs , extended clusters ( ec ; also known as fuzzy clusters ) , ucds and cores of dwarf spheroidals ( dsph ) and dwarf ellipticals ( de ) are taken from @xcite .",
    "data for nucleated dwarf galaxies ( ngc ; also known as nuclear gcs ) , and galactic gcs that have hot bhbs from @xcite .",
    "data for m31-g1 and @xmath8  cen were taken from the sources listed in table  [ tab : superclusters ] .",
    "the diagonal lines show the locus of constant mean surface density of @xmath127 and 10  l / pc@xmath22 , within the half - light radius . during stripping of a dwarf galaxy",
    ", its nucleus is expected to experience expansion and also fade in intensity @xcite .",
    "this would reduce the surface brightness , moving the points roughly along a direction perpendicular to the constant surface brightness lines .    with a mean surface density of @xmath128  l / pc@xmath22",
    ", gc1 is among the highest surface density objects , especially among the luminous objects .",
    "the classes of objects that are more massive than gc1 are cores of des , ucds and ngcs .",
    "the progenitor candidate should have higher surface density than the presently observed value for gc1 to account for the expansion and fading associated with stripping .",
    "the high surface brightness nucleated dwarf galaxies are the only objects satisfying this criterion , and hence are the most likely progenitors of gc1 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the observed ellipticity of gc1 ( @xmath129 ) , is almost identical to the mean ellipticity of nuclei of dwarf galaxies ( @xmath130 ; @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "propose nuclei of dwarf galaxies as progenitors of gcs with hot bhbs , a property shared by gc1 .",
    "thus , all the observed evidence points towards a dwarf galaxy nuclear origin for gc1 .",
    "it is most likely that the nucleated dwarf galaxy that was once upon a time the progenitor of gc1 was intact for at least the first 1 gyr , helping in its metal - enrichment .",
    "subsequently , as the dwarf galaxy started accreting onto m81 , the tidal forces dissolved the galaxy , leaving behind the compact nucleus indistinguishable in appearance from a classical gc .",
    "we investigate the nature of the brightest gc in m81 by carrying out a detailed analysis of multi - band photometric and optical spectroscopic data .",
    "we establish that the cluster is old ( age@xmath131  gyr ) and metal - rich ( @xmath103=-0.60\\pm0.10 $ ] ) .",
    "the uv excess suggests the presence of @xmath5 hot blue horizontal branch stars , a characteristic common in many metal - rich gcs .",
    "the cluster is bluer in its core , suggesting that the hot bhb stars are concentrated at the centre of the cluster .",
    "the radial profile of the cluster can be fitted very well with a king profile of a core radius @xmath2  pc , and a logarithmic concentration index of 1.88 .",
    "the low @xmath9 and high concentration index suggest that the cluster is in a post core - collapse phase .",
    "all the observed properties of gc1 support the idea that it could be the left - over nucleus of a dwarf galaxy that has been dissolved during its accretion onto m81 in the early epoch of its formation .",
