    "in the cores of relaxed clusters and groups of galaxies the cooling time for the hot x  ray emitting intracluster medium ( icm ) can be substantially less than the hubble time ( e.g. , edge et al .",

    "2006 ) . in the absence of any substantial sources of heating ,",
    "the gas in these regions will cool and recombine , constituting a cooling flow ( fabian & nulsen 1977 ; cowie & binney 1977 ) .",
    "however , high resolution x  ray imaging and spectroscopy , using the _ chandra _ and _ xmm  newton _ observatories , reveal unusually low quantities of cooling gas compared to the expectations from the standard cooling flow model ( e.g. , fabian 1994 ) , showing that , even in the cores , the gas temperature does not fall below @xmath112 kev ( e.g. , peterson et al .",

    "the fate of the cooling gas , and the possible involvement of additional heating ( _ feedback _ ) to compensate for the observed radiative losses and regulate the cooling by ( re)heating the gas , remains the subject of an extensive debate .",
    "one of the most promising sources of feedback is the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) harbored in the central dominant galaxy in these systems ( e.g. , tabor & binney 1993 ; nusser et al .",

    "evidence of strong interactions between the radio and thermal plasma can be found in the detection of x  ray disturbances in the hot gas , such as cavities , edges and filaments , which appear correlated with the structure of the central radio galaxy ( see for instance the review by blanton 2004 ) . however , the mechanism of the energy transfer from the radio source to the surrounding thermal gas ( e.g. , shocks , gravity waves , turbulence ) is still unclear , as is the mechanism of the distribution of energy throughout the cooling region ( e.g. , mcnamara & nulsen 2007 ) . +   + the combination of high quality x ",
    "ray imaging and high sensitivity radio observations is a powerful tool to investigate the icm / agn connection in clusters and groups .",
    "in particular , the examination of radio images at multiple frequencies ( especially at frequencies @xmath21  ghz ) is important to study the cycle of radio activity and elucidate the timescales and physical mechanisms of the energy injection . with this aim in mind",

    "ray images from _ chandra _ and/or _ xmm  newton _ observations show that most of these systems have a structure in the x  ray suggestive of strong interaction between the central radio source and the intragroup gas ( giacintucci et al . in preparation ) .",

    "the enthalpy h of a rising adiabatic bubble is the sum of the @xmath144 work done to displace the x  ray emitting gas , and its thermal energy , and is given by @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the pressure of the surrounding icm , @xmath147 the volume of the bubble and @xmath57 the ratio of specific heats of the gas .",
    "for an ideal relativistic gas , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 . in case of a non - relativistic plasma filling the bubble , and also in the presence of significant magnetic fields in the lobes ,",
    "the value of enthalpy could be a factor of 2 lower .",
    "churazov et al .",
    "( 2002 ) argue that almost all of this enthalpy can be transferred as thermal energy to the icm",
    ".    to assemble the equivalent of @xmath138  erg of mechanical energy , which is needed to produce the isothermal profile in the core of awm4 , as estimated by os05 , with the lobe pressure being @xmath150 dyne  @xmath67 ( see table  6 ) , would require the entire enthalpy ( @xmath151 ) of a spherical bubble of radius of over @xmath180 kpc .",
    "inflating this bubble against a pressure as high as jet pressure , which is an order of magnitude higher , would require a bubble of half this size , whereas a value of enthalpy that is lower than @xmath152 would only require a larger bubble .",
    "such an extensive displacement of plasma in the icm would be easily apparent in the _ xmm  newton _ observation of awm4 , where no such features are seen within the inner 200  kpc , in the gas associated with the radio lobes of 4c+24.36 .",
    "even if the heating is due to an abundance of buoyant bubbles , the larger ones should have been evident in the deep x ",
    "ray image . a forthcoming deep x",
    " ray observation ( 80 ks ) at higher angular resolution , to be obtained by _ chandra _ during cycle  9 , will possibly yield a better insight into the presence or absence of cavities in this system .",
    "in this paper we presented a detailed morphological and spectral analysis , at radio wavelengths , of the wat radio galaxy 4c+24.36 , located at the core of the poor galaxy cluster awm4 , based on new high sensitivity observations at 235  mhz , 327  mhz and 610  mhz , using the gmrt , and literature and archival data at other frequencies .",
    "the large scale source structure appears bent in a very similar wat morphology at all frequencies , and all resolutions afforded by our gmrt images .",
    "we interpret this bending to be the result of the interplay of ram pressure ( driven by the motion of the host galaxy ngc6051 ) and buoyancy forces . in the framework of this model",
    ", we estimate that the velocity of the galaxy ngc6051 , with respect to the cluster , is @xmath21 120 km s@xmath3 , in the plane of the sky .",
    "combined with the upper limit on the radial velocity of ngc6051 , which is @xmath21 20 km s@xmath3 with respect to the mean radial velocity , out to @xmath124  mpc , of the cluster awm4 ( koranyi & geller 2002 ) , our result indicates that the galaxy is expected to be relatively at rest in the potential well of the cluster .    on the small scale ,",
    "the radio jets show prominent symmetric oscillations within the central @xmath125 kpc from the core .",
    "an appealing possibility to explain these features is the development of kelvin ",
    "helmholtz helical instabilities propagating along the jets .",
    "however the resolution of our images is not high enough to investigate the fine structure of the jets , and to determine the characteristics of a possible distortion wave .",
    "deep radio observations at higher resolution , combined with polarisation information , are necessary to carry out a more detailed analysis of the jet regions .    combining the new gmrt observations , with data from the literature at various other frequencies ( see tab .  4 )",
    ", we derived the broadband radio spectrum of 4c+24.36 , and found that it is well fitted by a power  law with @xmath153 between 74 mhz and 10.7  ghz . from the gmrt images at 235 and 610 mhz , evaluating the spectral index distribution at discrete intervals along each jet",
    ", we showed ( fig .",
    "7 ) how the spectral index gradually steepens along the jet to about @xmath154 where the jets merge into the lobes , and further steadily steepens within the lobes to @xmath155 .    assuming equipartition of energy between the relativistic particles and the ambient magnetic field , and adopting a lower energy cutoff equivalent to the minimum lorentz factor of the radiating electrons ( @xmath156=10 , @xmath157 mev ) , we find that the equipartition value of the magnetic field varies between 3 to 9@xmath59 g from the lobes to the jets . the radiative age for 4c+24.36",
    "was found to be around 160  myr from this estimate .",
    "we used the jet to counterjet brightness ratio to constrain the geometry and velocity of the jet . assuming a typical value for the inner jet velocity in wat radio galaxies",
    ", we found that the source is likely oriented at a large angle ( @xmath1 81@xmath888@xmath8 ) with respect to the line of sight .",
    "this result is consistent with the high level of symmetry found in the total flux density , extent , spectral index properties and physical parameters of the lobes and jets .",
    "even though the host cluster awm04 has a hot x  ray emitting icm of relaxed morphology and uniform temperature profile out to at least 160  kpc from the center , its cooling time in the core is about 2  gyr , indicating the presence of significant sources of energy injection that prevents the catastrophic cooling expected in the core of the cluster .",
    "based on the above values of the jet power and the estimated radiative age , the total energy output from the radio source falls short by almost two orders of magnitude of the energy required for the isothermal temperature profile obtained from the _ xmm  newton _ observation of the cluster .",
    "the latter observation enables us to measure the pressure of the hot gas as a function of radius within the cluster , which is found to be comparable to the pressure in the jets over most of their lengths , but higher than the pressure in the lobes by a factor @xmath1585 .",
    "several interpretations of this pressure imbalance are discussed .",
    "finally , it is found that for any reasonable value of gas pressure in the range between the value in the lobes and that in the jets , if the central source were to transfer mechanical energy to the icm , in terms of the enthalpy of buoyant bubbles of relativistic fluid , it would require bubbles of tens of kpc in radius , which would have been detected in the existing xmm - newton observations of osullivan et al .",
    "we look forward to a forthcoming deeper _ chandra _ observation of this system for further insight into morphological evidence of this energy transfer .",
