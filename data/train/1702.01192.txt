    "bifurcation theory is one of the most powerful tools in studying deformations of elastic beams , plates and shells .",
    "numerous works have been devoted to the study of bifurcation in elasticity theory ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "a familiar example from beam theory is the problem of stability of an isotropic elastic rod lying on a deformable foundation which is being compressed by forces at the ends ( see fig .",
    "[ rys1 ] ) . for small forces",
    "the rod maintains its shape , however , as the forces increase they reach a first critical value beyond which the rod may buckle .    in this work ,",
    "we consider mixed boundary conditions which are as follows .",
    "the beam is free at the left end , and so it may move as in figure [ rys2 ] below .",
    "however , we require the shear force at the left end to vanish . at the right end",
    ", we assume the beam to be simply supported .",
    "as we will show later , equilibrium forms of the rod under these boundary conditions satisfy the boundary value problem    @xmath0,\\\\        x^{'}(-r)=x^{'''}(-r)=0 , \\\\",
    "x(r)=x^{''}(r)=0 ,      \\end{cases}\\ ] ]    where @xmath1 is a parameter of the compressive force , @xmath2 is a parameter of the elastic foundation , and @xmath3 is a nonlinear term which we define in below .",
    "it follows from the definition of @xmath3 that for small forces the only solution of is the trivial one , i.e. @xmath4 , @xmath5 $ ] , which corresponds to the straight rod in our bifurcation model .        however",
    ", as the forces increase the rod may buckle and it is desirable to know for which positive parameter values @xmath6 this might happen .    in order to answer this question , we associate with the linear boundary value problem    @xmath7,\\\\        x^{'}(-r)=x^{'''}(-r)=0 , \\\\        x(r)=x^{''}(r)=0      \\end{cases}\\ ] ]    and we denote by @xmath8 its space of solutions .",
    "the main theorem of this paper shows that a necessary and sufficient condition for bifurcation , and so for the possibility of a buckling of the rod , is that @xmath9 .",
    "let us point out that a similar model was investigated by a.  borisovich , yu .",
    "morozov and cz .",
    "szymczak in @xcite , where the authors assumed that the rod is simply supported at both ends .",
    "they proved the existence of simple bifurcation points ( meaning that @xmath10 ) by applying a variational version of the crandall - rabinowitz theorem ( compare thm .",
    "[ crarab ] below ) .",
    "later , in @xcite , a.  borisovich and j.  dymkowska showed a corresponding result under our boundary conditions , however , to the best of our knowledge the existence of multiple bifurcation points in the solution set of is new .",
    "note that here we prove even more , namely the existence of multiple branching points .",
    "finally , let us mention that other models for buckling are described for example in @xcite .",
    "our paper is composed of three sections . in section [ mathmod ]",
    "we derive the equation of equilibrium forms of the rod and state our main theorem .",
    "section [ proof ] is devoted to the proof of this result .",

    "the authors wish to express their thanks to professor czesaw szymczak from the faculty of ocean engineering and ship technology of gdask university of technology for several helpful comments concerning the model .",
    "the authors are greatly indebted to professor jzef e.  sienkiewicz , the physicist from the faculty of applied physics and mathematics of gdask university of technology , for pointing out a mistake in the formula for @xmath11 in @xcite .",
    "our special thanks go to a student of mathematics at gdask university of technology , aleksander rogiski , for the preparation of pictures for the article .",
    "in this section we derive the equation of equilibrium forms of the rod by a variational approach along the lines of @xcite .",
    "the following formulas for @xmath12 and @xmath13 are as in @xcite , but as a result of conversations with j.e .",
    "sienkiewicz and cz .",
    "szymczak , the formula for @xmath11 has been improved .",
    "the authors of @xcite assumed that the rod under the action of the compressing force became longer , and so their assumption does not agree with experiments .",
    "our refinement leads to a different nonlinear term in the equation , however the system , obtained by linearizing , is not changed .    due to the fact that the work of a.  borisovich and j.  dymkowska contains a mistake , and moreover , it appeared only in polish and in a limited number of copies",
    ", we do not restrict the discussion to explain the improvement , but for the convenience of the reader we provide a detailed exposition of the mathematical model .",
    "the total potential energy @xmath14 of the system composed of the rod and the foundation is equal to :    @xmath15    where    * @xmath12 is the energy of the compressed rod , * @xmath11 is the work of the compressing force , * @xmath13 is the energy of the winkler foundation ( i.e. of the springs ) .",
    "the energy @xmath12 is given by    @xmath16    where    @xmath17    is the curvature of the rod at a point @xmath5 $ ] , @xmath18 is young s modulus and @xmath19 is the moment of inertia of the cross section of the rod .",
    "the second energy @xmath11 is defined as    @xmath20    where    @xmath21    is the horizontal displacement of the left end of the rod and @xmath22 is the value of the compressing force .",
    "finally , the energy @xmath13 is defined by    @xmath23    where    @xmath24    is determined experimentally , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are parameters of the elastic foundation .",
    "expanding @xmath27 and @xmath28 as maclaurin series , we get    @xmath29    and    @xmath30    respectively . if we omit the terms of order higher than @xmath31 , we obtain    @xmath32    and    @xmath33    hence the approximative formula for the total potential energy has the form    @xmath34    we now define    @xmath35\\colon x'(-r)=x'''(-r)=0,\\ \\ x(r)=x''(r)=0\\}\\ ] ]    which is a banach space with respect to the standard norm    @xmath36}{|x^{(k)}(s)|}}.\\ ] ]    note that the boundary conditions in the definition of @xmath37 describe the behaviour of the rod at its ends ( see fig .",
    "[ rys2 ] ) .",
    "setting    @xmath38    and dividing the formula by @xmath39 , we obtain a functional @xmath40 defined by    @xmath41    in what follows we refer to @xmath42 as _ the energy functional _ , and we note for later reference that its derivative with respect to the space variable @xmath43 is    @xmath44    for all @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "let us now denote by @xmath47 the space @xmath48 $ ] with the standard norm    @xmath49}{|y(s)|},\\ ] ]    and let us consider the map @xmath50 defined by    @xmath51    if we set    @xmath52    for each @xmath53 , then the operator equation    @xmath54    is equivalent to our previously introduced boundary value problem .",
    "clearly , the trivial function @xmath55 satisfies the equation for all values of parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath56 .",
    "we call the set @xmath57 given by    @xmath58    _ the trivial family _ of solutions of the equation .",
    "naturally , a solution of is said to be _ nontrivial _ if it does not belong to @xmath59 .",
    "an interesting phenomenon is when there is a  branching  of the equation in correspondence with some value of the multiparameter @xmath60 .",
    "this is the object of bifurcation theory .",
    "a point @xmath61 is called a bifurcation point of if in every neighbourhood of it in @xmath62 there is a nontrivial solution of , in other words , @xmath63 belongs to the closure in @xmath64 of the set of nontrivial solutions of the equation .",
    "+ in particular , a bifurcation point @xmath61 of the equation is said to be a branching point if there is a continuum ( namely a closed connected set ) of nontrivial solutions of which contains @xmath63 .    integrating by parts in",
    ", we have    @xmath65    if we denote by @xmath66 the standard inner product in @xmath67 , i.e.    @xmath68    then    @xmath69    for all @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , we call @xmath70 _ the variational gradient _ of @xmath42 , and we see from that solutions of are critical points of .    differentiating the map @xmath70 with respect to the space variable @xmath43 at @xmath55 we get    @xmath71    for every @xmath72 and @xmath46 , and so    @xmath73    we can now state the main result of this paper .    [ mainthm ] a point @xmath61 is a branching point of the equation if and only if @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath75    our theorem extends theorem 5.3.2 of @xcite , which states that @xmath74 is a necessary condition for bifurcation in the solution set of the equation at a point @xmath63 .    it is worth pointing out that the theorem shows that the parameter @xmath56 has no influence on the occurrence of bifurcation",
    "in order to prove theorem [ mainthm ] , we first discuss some properties of the nonlinear map @xmath70 .      the linear operator @xmath77\\rightarrow y$ ] , @xmath78 is surjective and its kernel consists of all polynomials of degree at most @xmath79 .",

    ", it follows that @xmath84 is a compact perturbation of the restriction of @xmath80 to @xmath37 and so a fredholm operator of index zero .                          1 .",
    "if the point @xmath6 does not belong to any ray @xmath90 , then @xmath94 and the linear boundary value problem possesses only the trivial solution .",
    "if the point @xmath6 belongs to one and only one ray @xmath90 , then @xmath95 and @xmath8 is generated by @xmath96 3 .",
    "if the point @xmath6 belongs to the intersection of two rays @xmath97 and @xmath98 then @xmath99 and the two linearly independent functions @xmath100 and @xmath101 are a basis of @xmath8 .",
    "it follows from the implicit function theorem and proposition [ fredholm ] that there is no bifurcation at points @xmath61 if @xmath102 .",
    "hence theorem [ kernel ] shows that bifurcation can only occur at multiparameters @xmath60 where @xmath103 for some @xmath104 .          for the convenience of the reader we present our own proof that is based on a variational version of the crandall - rabinowitz theorem on simple bifurcation points from @xcite , thus making our exposition self - contained .",
    "combining with proposition [ fredholm ] , the proof of theorem [ mainthm ] in the first case will be completed by showing that at least one of the partial derivatives @xmath132 or @xmath133 is not trivial , where @xmath134 is the function introduced in theorem [ kernel ] .            by theorem [ crarab ]",
