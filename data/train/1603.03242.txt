    "one can observe the rapid growth of @xmath54 ( in units of @xmath131 , fig .",
    "[ fig : aux]b ) simultaneously with considerable suppression of @xmath122-factor in metallic state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : aux]a ) , which can be interpreted as an enhancement of correlation effects for @xmath130 .",
    "a quantitative comparison with the real compounds ( see the introduction ) is hardly possible because of simplicity of our model which does not account for multiple bands , spin - orbit effects etc .",
    "however , a qualitative connection with some results for fullerides can be established .",
    "cs@xmath3c@xmath4 is af insulator at ambient conditions which becomes superconducting under pressure .",
    "the lowest unoccupied c@xmath4 molecular orbitals are threefold degenerate , but jahn  teller distortion lifts the degeneracy by pairing two electrons , only one electron remaining unpaired  @xcite .",
    "therefore the system can be roughly described by a single - band model , and we can state an agreement between the observed first - order transition from af insulator to pm superconductor  @xcite with the first - order transition from af insulator to pm metal at @xmath120 in fig .",
    "[ fig : mit ] . a qualitative analogy can be carried out with mno , where the nearest and next - nearest exchange integrals are of the same order  @xcite and a similar pressure induced first - order transition from type - ii af insulator to pm metal occurs  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the metal - insulator transition in mno is accompanied by a structural change which does not allow a direct comparison .",
    "while generally first - order transitions imply a possibility of magnetic phase separation , no evidences of this were found for cs@xmath3c@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "this result is confirmed by our calculations and is not surprising because the separation on underdoped and overdoped phases is practically impossible in the presence of the gap .",
    "to conclude , we found that the account of conduction electron degrees of freedom allows to catch some interesting physical features of magnetic states which are discarded within the localized - electron model .",
    "the electron transfer effects lift the degeneracy of magnetic states ( _ e .",
    "g. _ , of collinear and spiral af type - iii ordering ) which is present within the localized model . at large @xmath94 the anderson kinetic exchange mechanism establishes the equivalence of the heisenberg and half - filled hubbard models , and the transition from af - iii to af - ii occurs at @xmath136 ( fig .  [ fig : mit ] ) , which is in excellent agreement with the corresponding result of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath137 . however , at smaller @xmath94 the phase diagram turns out to be strongly asymmetric with respect to the sign of @xmath56 and demonstrates presence of antiferromagnetic and spiral metallic phases between paramagnetic metal and antiferromagnetic insulator regions .",
    "these metallic phases are influenced differently by correlations effects : at @xmath138 these states appears to be unstable due to bandwidth suppression and the magnetic order vanishes for most cases ; at @xmath139 these regions are stable at the cost of substantial reduction of magnetization amplitude .",

    "<S> the ground - state magnetic phase diagram ( including collinear and spiral states ) of the single - band hubbard model for the face - centered cubic lattice and related metal - insulator transition ( mit ) are investigated within the slave - boson approach by kotliar and ruckenstein . the correlation - induced electron spectrum narrowing and a comparison with a generalized hartree - fock approximation allow one to estimate the strength of correlation effects . </S>",
