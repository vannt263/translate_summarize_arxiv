    "<S> einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) highlighted the phenomenon of entanglement  @xcite : it is possible to see perfect correlations between measurement outcomes obtained by two observers , alice and bob , at distant locations , while for each observer his / her outcomes appear to be statistically random . </S>",

    "<S> this is very challenging to accomplish in the paradigm of bell - nonlocality testing : if specific observables with @xmath0 settings and @xmath1 possible outcomes are used , bipartite quantum states with local hilbert space dimension @xmath1 can violate a bell inequality by a factor of @xmath2  @xcite , later improved to @xmath3  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> in particular , the method enables constructing an inequality which is robust with respect to the degree of unbiasedness of bases and it employs generalized mubs , where unbiasedness may vary from one observable to another or even form one eigenvector element to another . </S>",

    "<S> quantum steering was originally introduced by schrdinger in 1935  @xcite and it was elaborated in the course of time  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , it gained a lot of attention because it has been shown to be a weaker test of quantumness of correlations than bell inequalities thus , less experimentally demanding  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is different from it in that it quantifies discrepancy between the full quantum - mechanical treatment and the situation where only one of the observers is performing classical measurements ( e.g.  alice ) . </S>",
    "<S> the latter amounts to the local hidden state model ( lhs ) , where the assumption of objective existence of measurement outcomes without taking any measurements bounds alice in the possibility of steering bob s state . </S>",

    "<S> _ let us consider a quantum steering scenario shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : scheme ] . </S>",
    "<S> alice and bob have locally access to subsystems of a bipartite system described by a quantum state @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> alice chooses one of her settings @xmath7 , measures a nondegenerate observable @xmath8 with eigenvectors @xmath9 and receives a result @xmath10 with probability @xmath11 . only after alice </S>",
    "<S> has collected the result @xmath12 , the following conditional state @xmath13 was `` created at a distance '' at bob s location . </S>",
    "<S> the set @xmath14 is steerable if for every @xmath12 bob can find a basis of @xmath15 states @xmath16 which is identical to @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> this is possible only if @xmath6 is maximally entangled . </S>",
    "<S> the degree of the match between @xmath16 and @xmath14 for a given @xmath6 is measured by a steering functional : @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the set of all bipartite quantum states . </S>",

    "<S> are considered to be untrusted , i.e.  they are treated as a black box that receives inputs ( ) and reports outcomes ( ) . </S>",
    "<S> the state @xmath6 is now of a hybrid classical - quantum nature and it determines the form of the bob s conditional state as an average over ensemble of local hidden states @xmath20 , which existence is independent of taking any measurements by the observers  @xcite : @xmath21 the steering functional equals @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the set of all bipartite states fitting to the lhs model . </S>",
    "<S> its maximal value depends on the choice of bob s bases @xmath16 and will be estimated below .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum violation of our steering inequality is observed if @xmath24 we say that it is unbounded if the ratio @xmath25 between the quantum and classical value of the steering functional is an increasing function of some experimental parameters , for example of the amount of entanglement in @xmath6 or of a number and characteristics of the measured observables . </S>",
    "<S> an unbounded violation of  ( [ vq ] ) has been shown for a sequence of maximally entangled states with an increasing local dimension @xmath1 ( e.g.  maximally entangled states of larger and larger spin )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it necessitates employing very complicated measurements at bob s side  the mutually unbiased bases ( mubs ) with linearly diverging number of settings @xmath26 . in general , for a large dimension their existence is known only in same special cases and precise verification of their defining feature that @xmath27 for @xmath28 is experimentally very challenging .    rather than trying to cure these problems our method </S>",
    "<S> shall simply overcome them . </S>",
    "<S> to this end , we will relax the mub condition by assuming near - uniform overlaps and will seek for the maximal overlap between the bases . in this way , our result is naturally linked to the deutsch  maassen  </S>",
    "<S> uffink uncertainty relations  @xcite saying that the shannon entropies of measurement outcomes of two nondegenerate observables obtained in two bases @xmath16 and @xmath29 for a quantum state @xmath30 satisfy @xmath31 where the maximal overlap @xmath32 is a quantitative measure of complementarity of the bases . </S>",
    "<S> the inequality is nontrivial if the two observables do not commute .    </S>",
    "<S> our main result is the following    _ theorem . given a quantum steering scenario involving @xmath33 settings , @xmath34 outcomes , and a set of @xmath15 orthonormal eingenbases @xmath35 defining the receiver s ( bob s ) measurements , the lhs steering functional is bounded from above @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 for @xmath39 is defined as in the deutsch  maassen  uffink uncertainty relations </S>",
    "<S> this implies : @xmath40 in particular , a weaker bound can be derived : @xmath41 with @xmath42 . </S>",

    "<S> let us observe that any state @xmath6 leading to @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is given by ( [ sq ] ) but without taking supremum over @xmath18 , violates the steering inequality  ( [ steeringineq ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence solely on the maximal overlap @xmath45 frees us from the necessity of a precise control of all mub conditions separately , as it was done in the approaches taken before ours  @xcite . while the physical interpretation of the parameter @xmath45 is very clear , that of @xmath46 is less comprehensible . @xmath45 </S>",
    "<S> simply quantifies the two most `` compatible '' eigenvectors of the measured observables and equals the maximal element of the @xmath47 @xmath48 matrix with columns and rows enumerated by the settings indexes @xmath49 and @xmath50 . </S>",

    "<S> interestingly , our mathematical techniques allow us finding the classical bound if we analyze this matrix along its `` diagonals '' consisting of the elements with indexes @xmath51 , and @xmath46 denotes the maximal element in such `` @xmath52th diagonal '' .    </S>",
    "<S> now we shall define the relaxed mub condition by introducing the maximal overlap equal @xmath53 with @xmath54 , where @xmath55 corresponds to the original mub measurements . </S>",
    "<S> any quantum bases satisfying this condition form a generalized mub . </S>",
    "<S> let us now examine violation of inequality ( @xmath56 ) for this @xmath57-generalized mub condition . </S>",
    "<S> unbounded violation is possible whenever the number of settings @xmath58 is an increasing function of @xmath1 but , now it can increase arbitrarily slowly </S>",

    "<S> @xmath61 reproduces the result reported in  @xcite but , without the need for the linear scaling @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> equivalently , considering the dependence on the number of settings by putting @xmath63 , we obtain at most @xmath64 in the limit of large @xmath15 . however , the best this steering inequality may offer is @xmath65 , which coincides with the maximal possible degree of bell inequality violation @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it follows immediately from the fact that @xmath67 which is easy to derive by considering alice s and bob s measurement statistics on a pure product state ( independently on the number of settings and outcomes ) . </S>",
    "<S> explanation of the discrepancy between the bounds @xmath68 and @xmath15 calls for further research , but it might hold true that the present @xmath68 scaling is optimal and addresses the issue of optimality of the mub settings .    </S>",
    "<S> we now would like to turn our abstract mathematical result into a form which could be tested in a laboratory . </S>",
    "<S> we first consider a source of independent pairs of photons entangled in their polarizations , i.e. many copies of singlet states @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume a single pair fidelity @xmath70 , efficiency of each detector at alice side @xmath71 , which is required for conclusive version of a steering experiment ( see @xcite ) , and the relaxed mub condition @xmath72 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the local dimension of the state equals @xmath73 ( allowing existence of @xmath5 original mubs with @xmath74 , see e.g.  @xcite ) and we take the number of settings growing slower than the dimension , @xmath75 for @xmath76 ( @xmath15 is assumed to be integer ) . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the ratio @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> exponential unbounded violation of order of @xmath78 is observed if @xmath79 ( similar analysis can be performed for @xmath80 leading however , to more complicated formulas ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable that for any fidelity and efficiency satisfying @xmath81 , there exist @xmath57 and @xmath30 such that violation grows exponentially with the number of the entangled pairs @xmath82 .    ) as a function of @xmath82 copies of a singlet state and the parameter @xmath57 setting the relaxed mub condition . </S>",
    "<S> the best violation is obtained for @xmath83 , i.e. the original mubs . </S>",

    "<S> we assumed exemplary non - perfect fidelity of the singlet @xmath84 , detection efficiency @xmath85 and @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> the best violation is obtained for the original mubs , @xmath55 . relaxing this condition results in monotonic decrease of violation for increasing @xmath57 but </S>",
    "<S> , its exponential character is preserved . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : violation_eta ] depicts dependence of violation on the efficiency @xmath71 for fidelity @xmath84 , @xmath87 and @xmath86 . the minimal required efficiency to observe the violation equals @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> both figures reveal an interesting property of quantum steering : exponential decay of the global fidelity @xmath89 and efficiency @xmath90 , observed for multi - pair sources of entangled qubits , is suppressed by exponential number of measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is still possible to handle for small number of qubits ( as it is done in tomographic experiments ) . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , this proposal has recently been demonstrated for the case of @xmath91 copies , and @xmath92 settings corresponding to two mub elements  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main challenge in these types of experiments is extending the number of settings and generation of more mubs . </S>",
    "<S> this seems to require a significant nonlinearity , a resource which is rare . </S>",
    "<S> hence , below we shall consider a system where an unbounded violation of a steering inequality is possible using solely linear optics .    </S>",
    "<S> we will now employ a quantum - optical scheme based on a parametric - down - conversion source but working in a regime where it generates polarization entangled squeezed vacuum states . </S>",
    "<S> their quantum correlations posses the same rotational invariance as a usual two - photon polarization singlet and can be seen as two copies of approximate original epr correlations . due to this property </S>",
    "<S> , these states have recently been successfully used to reveal a bell nonlocality which does not vanish in the limit of large population  @xcite . using the same key feature and implementing the generalized mubs by merely polarization rotations </S>",
    "<S> , we will show that entangled squeezed vacuum states lead to unbounded violation of our steering inequality .    </S>",
    "<S> entangled squeezed vacuum is a superposition of @xmath93-photon polarization bell - singlet states @xmath94 with a probability amplitude @xmath95 , @xmath96 , where @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) is creation operator for a spatial mode @xmath12 ( @xmath99 ) and @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) denotes horizontal ( vertical ) polarization . </S>",
    "<S> perfect correlations present in each multi - particle polarization singlet are manifested by equal photon numbers in orthogonal polarizations in the spatial modes : @xmath102 they are preserved with respect to the global rotations of polarization . </S>",
    "<S> each spatial mode in @xmath103 contains fixed number of particles equal @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> projections on fock states constitute a natural framework for bob s photon counting measurements . </S>",
    "<S> they reveal not only the correlations but lead to post - selective creation of @xmath103 from the squeezed vacuum state @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for simplicity , in our considerations we will now focus on a particular @xmath105 .    in order to show unbounded violation ( [ quantum - violation ] ) for ( [ psi - n ] ) </S>",
    "<S> we will adopt a strategy similar to the one used in  @xcite : we will examine the correlations after applying incremental rotations on the spatial modes . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , due to rotational symmetry of @xmath105 , it is enough to consider the relative rotation angle between the modes @xmath12 and @xmath99 , further denoted by @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> each mode represents a @xmath107-dimensional hilbert space spanned by one of the basis chosen from a collection of @xmath15 bases , enumerated by @xmath108 , generated by an appropriate polarization rotation : @xmath109 they correspond to bob s @xmath110 bases discussed in the theorem and represent generalized mubs ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : suppl_overlap ] in the supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> we then have the following    _ proposition . </S>",
    "<S> given a set of @xmath15 bob s measurement bases @xmath111 with @xmath112 and @xmath113 , defined by some set of angles @xmath114 , the maximal overlap @xmath115 equals the maximal overlap between @xmath116 and @xmath117 with @xmath118 : @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 denotes the floor function . </S>",

    "<S> _    including experimental imperfections in their simplest form , we assume equal efficiency @xmath71 for each of the two detectors at alice s . for the multi - particle bell - singlet states ( [ psi - n ] ) </S>",
    "<S> this modifies the quantum value of the steering functional to @xmath124 and condition ( [ quantum - violation ] ) to @xmath125 . </S>",
    "<S> non - unit detection efficiency prevents from observation of the unbounded violation , which is expected . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the losses are moderate it will be possible to witness quantum steering for multi - particle quantum states . </S>",
    "<S> the price to pay with respect to our abstract result presented in the theorem is that in presence of losses the number of settings grows with the local dimension quicker . </S>",
    "<S> large number of measurements requires in turn very high accuracy in the polarization rotations .    </S>",

    "<S> this is the first quantum steering inequality which is formulated in an error - tolerant way . </S>",
    "<S> its robustness with respect to non - perfect measurement settings stems from its link to the entropic deutsch  </S>",
    "<S> maassen  </S>",
    "<S> uffink uncertainty relation : the same parameter governs strength of both inequalities . </S>",
    "<S> violation of this inequality with multi - particle quantum correlations seems feasible . </S>",
    "<S> we have suggested two experimental proposals . </S>",
    "<S> the first one is a proof of concept , which may serve as an illustrative example of unbounded violation of steering inequality involving relaxed mub measurements . </S>",
    "<S> it can be performed with small number of two - photon singlet states and measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the second proposal seems particularly remarkable and stunning : this is a linear optics experiment which , also for the first time , can confirm that increasing arbitrarily slowly the local dimension of a maximally entangled state is sufficient to observe an unlimited discrepancy between the classical and quantum description of the experiment shown in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : scheme ] .    </S>",
    "<S> our result highlights very clear distinction between steering and bell - nonlocality correlations . </S>",
    "<S> violation of bell inequalities with small number of settings vanishes for singlet states build from macroscopic qubits  @xcite or is constant for multi - particle bell - singlet states  @xcite . in the case of quantum steering , </S>",
    "<S> unbounded violation is possible for multi - particle generalization of the original epr correlations and almost constant number of settings in the form of mubs , or their feasible counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> the latter applied to multiple copies of a singlet state may enable violation of order of @xmath135 observed experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , multi - particle bipartite steering based on polarization entangled squeezed vacuum allows violation of order of @xmath136{d})$ ] at its best . </S>",
    "<S> its realization necessitates linear optics equipped with photon - number - resolving detection and the generalized mubs are implemented merely by polarization rotations , equally easy for every value of the local dimension . in our considerations we took into account experimental imperfections in the form of losses . </S>",
    "<S> further analysis of the possibility of loophole - free violation and the role of fair sampling assumption similar to  @xcite remains to be addressed .    </S>",
    "<S> our approach is very likely to be developed and exploited in several quantum information tasks which are of great technological interest . </S>",
    "<S> for example , recently the idea of partial characterization of the devices has been developed and has been expressed in terms of semi - device - independent scenarios  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this approach lies between the two extremes of device - independent and tomographic strategies and quantum steering is its natural prototype . </S>",
    "<S> multi - particle bipartite steering can be used for randomness certification and may foster development of optimal strategies in quantum random access codes .    the above potential applications result also from the fact that our result is getting feasible although , technological requirements for an experimental setup are high . </S>",
    "<S> polarization entangled squeezed vacuum states produced in parametric down conversion process , with mean photon number of the order of ten , are available in laboratories  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the states ( [ psi - n ] ) are created postselectively : each time alice or bob takes a measurement , the number of photons in each mode is known . </S>",
    "<S> experiments could employ the techniques of  @xcite and integrated optics setups equipped with superconducting transition - edge sensors ( tess )  @xcite , which posses photon - counting efficiencies near @xmath137 and have well - resolved photon - number peaks , up to around ten photons  @xcite . for an alternative experimental implementation </S>",

    "<S> our findings indicate new directions in the future research on quantum steering , by posing several open questions . </S>",
    "<S> the most intriguing is : how far does the general scaling in the number of settings @xmath15 go for the best steering monogamy relations ? in this context the first results on that type of monogamy @xcite need further development . to address these issues </S>",
    "<S> it might be useful to analyze the possible cases of steering inequalities with unequal number of settings at alice s and bob s . </S>",
    "<S> existence of the monogamy relations here is conceivable if the number of settings for the state estimation at bob s was of the order of the local dimension @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> then the asymmetric steering functional might satisfy a no - go limit in the form of an upper bound which value is fixed by diverging number of settings . verifying this question is an important problem since it would determine what is the relation between bell correlations and steering inequalities from the perspective of monogamy relation on the ground of no - signaling theories . </S>",
    "<S> another interesting puzzle is : can an asymmetric steering functional reveal quantumness in a more adequate way than the original one ( cf .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) ? </S>",
    "<S> if yes , its potential applications in information processing may be worth examining . </S>",
    "<S> our result highlights this point and we are planning to consider it in our future work .    </S>",
    "<S> our findings open new conceptual and experimental perspective for steering inequalities and therefore , naturally stimulate questions in the context of quantum - information resources theory . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if and how the recent application of rigidity of quantum steering to device - independent one - sided computation  @xcite can be adopted and made useful in our case ? </S>",
    "<S> further , it would be interesting to examine our result on the ground of general probabilistic theories referred to the receiver s ( bob ) system ( cf .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and references therein ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we hope that the results and discussion presented in this paper will stimulate the future research on quantum correlations in a broader context , including their applications and demonstrations .    </S>",
    "<S> _ methods . _ </S>",
    "<S> the proof of our theorem involves a surprisingly powerful modification of the former analysis presented in  @xcite : it builds - in tolerance for possible errors in measurement settings . </S>",
    "<S> this was not possible in the framework of  @xcite . in  @xcite the steering functional @xmath138 </S>",
    "<S> is bounded by the operator norm of a gramm matrix @xmath139 with matrix elements equal @xmath140 . </S>",
    "<S> its estimation is very troublesome because the matrix involves probabilities of an unknown value , resulting from the local hidden state model . </S>",
    "<S> hence , any upper bound on the matrix norm @xmath141 must optimize over all probability values . </S>",
    "<S> our technique was to exploit the tensor structure appearing due to double indices in a new , much efficient way . </S>",
    "<S> this was done by means of specific decomposition of the @xmath142 part of the structure , which employs mutually orthogonal shift @xmath143 matrices . </S>",
    "<S> this key trick allows to go much farther beyond the rough estimates of hidden probabilities parameters used so far . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the latter allows to bound the maximal eigenvalue of the product @xmath144 thus , the singular value of @xmath139 as well , by factorizing out the probabilities due to their normalization rather then simply binding them all by unity . </S>",
    "<S> this allows to control the degree of mutual unbiasedness among all the bases individually i.e. from one pair to another in terms of deutsch  maassen  uffink parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> derivation of the proposition exploited the properties of rotational symmetry of multi - particle bell - singlet states and the fact that the overlaps between multi - particle polarization bases ( [ polarizationbases ] ) generate a probability distribution @xmath145 which corresponds to a two - dimensional continuous - time quantum walk  @xcite ( see the supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath146 does not follow the central limit theorem and its maximal values are taken at the boundaries of its domain . </S>",
    "<S> further , to obtain the formula ( [ c ] ) , some specific properties of binomial coefficients were used  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic value of the maximal overlap was computed using the stirling s formula . </S>",
    "<S> optimal number of settings @xmath128 and set of angles for given @xmath1 and @xmath147 were found by a numerical algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> technical details are presented in the supplementary information .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we would like to stress that the experimental implementation requires correct space - time arrangement  @xcite and any faster - than - light signaling due to apparatus correlations must be excluded ( in order to avoid controversies similar to the ones which arose in some tests of bell inequalities ) .    </S>",
