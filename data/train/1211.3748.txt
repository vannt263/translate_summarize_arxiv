    "nevertheless , significant progress has been made by different approaches , such as ( 1 ) analytical approximations : perturbative renormalization group method ( rg ) @xcite , hamiltonian flow equations@xcite , functional rg@xcite , strong - coupling expansions@xcite , master equations@xcite ; ( 2 ) exact analytical solutions : field theory techniques@xcite , the scattering bethe ansatz@xcite , mapping of a steady - state non - equilibrium problem onto an effective equilibrium system@xcite ; ( 3 ) numerical methods : time - dependent density matrix renormalization group ( rg)@xcite , time - dependent numerical rg@xcite , diagrammatic monte carlo@xcite , and imaginary - time nonequilibrium quantum monte carlo@xcite .    in this paper , we provide a comprehensive analysis of the non - equilibrium transport near a quantum phase transition in a dissipative resonant level model by employing the recently developed frequency - dependent rg@xcite and functional rg approaches@xcite , and extending our earlier work in ref .  .",
    "we aim to address several fundamental questions related to the non - equilibrium transport in quantum dot settings , such as : what is the distinct non - equilibrium conductance profile at zero temperature compared to that in equilibrium at finite temperatures near the transition ?",
    "is there any scaling behavior of the conductance at finite temperatures and finite bias voltage near the transition ?    for this purpose , we investigate three classes of typical nano - models comprising a spinless resonant level coupled to : ( i ) two non - interacting fermi - liquid leads subject to an ohmic dissipative environment , where an ohmic environment can be realized in a nanoscale resistor and has many applications in physics ranging from mesoscopic physics ( refs . ) to biological systems@xcite , ( ii ) two interacting fermion baths , in particular two fractional quantum hall edge ( fqhe)@xcite leads , or the `` chiral luttinger liquids '' where electrons on the edge of a 2d fractional quantum hall system show one - dimensional chiral luttinger liquid behaviors with only one species of electrons ( left or right movers ) , ( iii ) two interacting luttinger - liquid leads subject to an ohmic dissipative environment .    in the class ( i ) model ,",

    "we compute the current operator in section ii c for these three classes of models .",
    "we employ the nonequilibrium rg approach in section iii . our results on nonequilibrium transport near the quantum phase transition both at zero and finite temperatures are presented in section iv , followed by the results on the nonequilibrium finite - frequency current noise in section v.",

    "the conductance @xmath406 follows the equilibrium behavior ; by increasing @xmath0 , the frequency - dependence of the couplings begins to play an important role and therefore we systematically find scaling behavior of the non - equilibrium conductance very distinct from that of the equilibrium counterpart .",
    "we have also analyzed the finite temperature profile of @xmath284 at the transition as well as in the localized phase and found that the conductance shows different behaviors for @xmath3 and @xmath268 ; it exhibits @xmath407 scaling behavior for @xmath282 .",
    "+ regarding transport properties of our system near the transition , the role played by the bias voltage is very different from that played by the temperature .",
    "the key to these very different behaviors lies in the fact that the non - equilibrium charge ( or effective spin ) decoherence rate , which serves as a cutoff for the rg flows of the kondo couplings , is a highly non - linear function of the bias voltage .",
    "further investigations are needed to address the full crossover function in conductance as well as the scaling behaviors of the dynamical quantities near the transition in a search for the existence of the `` effective temperature '' that allows one to generalize the equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation theorem to the non - equilibrium regime .",
    "furthermore , we provide signatures of the localized - delocalized transition in the finite - frequency current noise spectrum and the ac conductance .",
