    "the formation and evolution of galaxies is one of the hottest topics in astronomy and astrophysics .",
    "great progress in the field has been had ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) , and two luminosity - weighted stellar - population parameters ( age and metallicity ) of galaxies are crucial . a lot of stellar population synthesis models such as @xcite(hereafter bc03 ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have been brought forward for stellar population studies and a great deal of observational data have been supplied by big surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the two - micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) . however , it is difficult to measure the stellar ages and metallicities of some distant galaxies ( e.g. , galaxies with redshifts greater than 0.3 ) via the spectra - like methods .",
    "the reason is that reliable spectra or line - strength indices ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) are usually available for some nearby galaxies .",
    "if we can use one of important observational results , i.e. , photometry , we will be able to explore the stellar populations of some distant galaxies . because colours are easier to be obtained than spectra and are independent of the distances of objects , they are good candidates for studying the stellar populations of such galaxies .",
    "many works have been tried in this way , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "it seems possible to break the stellar age ",
    "metallicity degeneracy @xcite by colours .",
    "many pairs of colours ( hereafter colour pairs ) are used in previous works , e.g. , @xmath20 and @xmath21 by @xcite , @xmath22 and @xmath21 by @xcite , @xmath23 and @xmath24 by @xcite , @xmath25 and @xmath26 by @xcite , @xmath27 and @xmath25 by @xcite , @xmath27 and @xmath24 by @xcite , and most colours used are only in @xmath18 bands .",
    "as advocated by , e.g. , @xcite , colours relating to both @xmath18 and @xmath19 bands , i.e. , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , can be used to select galaxies with various redshifts .",
    "similar colours can possibly be used to break the stellar age  metallicity degeneracy .",
    "we intend to give some investigations in this work , using the bc03 stellar population synthesis model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 , we briefly introduce the bc03 model and the calculation of colours . in sect .",
    "3 , we present the age and metallicity sensitivities of colours . in sect .",
    "4 , we try to search for colour pairs that can be used to constrain stellar age and metallicity . in sect . 5 , we give our discussions and conclusions .",
    "the bc03 model is a widely used model in stellar population synthesis study .",
    "its standard model takes the @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) and uses padova 1994 library tracks to calculate integrated colours .",
    "a few alternative stellar spectral libraries are considered to give the spectral predictions of simple stellar populations ( ssps ) .",
    "the model provides us magnitudes and colours on both johnson - cousins - glass ( @xmath30 bands ) and ab ( @xmath19 bands ) systems .",
    "more detailed information about the model please refer to @xcite . in this work ,",
    "@xmath31 magnitudes on ab system are recalculated from those given on johnson - cousins - glass system , by taking -0.1 , 0.0 , 0.2 , 0.45 , 0.9 , 1.4 , and 1.9 as the differences between the zero points of ab system and johnson - cousins - glass system magnitudes , in @xmath1 , @xmath3 , @xmath5 , @xmath7 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 bands , respectively.ikb/convert-units/node1.html ]",
    "we study the age and metallicity sensitivities by a relative metallicity sensitivity ( @xmath32 ) technique , which was used by @xcite and @xcite , and find age- and metallicity - sensitive colours based on the @xmath32 of colours .",
    "the @xmath32 method estimates the @xmath32 of each colour by the ratio of percentage change of age to that of metallicity when they lead to the same change in a colour respectively .",
    "colours with large @xmath32 ( @xmath331.0 ) are more sensitive to metallicity and those with small @xmath32 ( @xmath141.0 ) to stellar age . following @xcite , we calculated the @xmath32 of each colour in this work .",
    "the @xmath32 of 66 ab system colours are calculated in the work .",
    "the detailed data are listed in table 1 . as we see , @xmath25 , @xmath21 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath24 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 are more sensitive to stellar metallicity while @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath27 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 to stellar age .",
    "we select the former ten colours as age - sensitive colours while the latter ten as metallicity - sensitive colours .",
    ".relative metallicity sensitivities of 66 ab system colours . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in fact , even if we take lick indices for such work , the uncertainties in stellar ages and metallicities of these galaxies are very big because of the large observational uncertainties . for our sample galaxies , the uncertainties in h@xmath50 and [ mgfe ] indices",
    "are typically about 0.3 @xmath51 , which will lead to large uncertainties in stellar - population parameters .",
    "the lick indices and uncertainties of our sample galaxies are taken from the garching sdss catalogs ( http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/sdss/dr4/ ) .",
    "furthermore , we found that 24 galaxies are out of the theoretical grid of bc03 models .",
    "this possibly results from the effects of young stellar populations of galaxies , the limitation of theoretical models , and large observational uncertainties of colours . in special",
    ", we found that most galaxies can fall inside the theoretical colour - colour grid when taking their colour uncertainties into account .",
    "this means that most of the 24 galaxies could have physical ages , but as pointed out by @xcite , the presence of young populations in such early - type galaxies can also make metal - rich populations outside the theoretical colour - colour grids .    in the work",
    ", we fitted the stellar ages and metallicities of our sample galaxies via bc03 ssps with ages within 0.119.96 gyr and metallicities within 0.00010.05 . in fig .",
    "3 , we compare the parameters determined by colours with those by a few lick indices @xcite .",
    "the results of @xcite were obtained by comparing d4000 , h@xmath50 , h@xmath52+h@xmath53 , [ mg@xmath54fe ] , and [ mgfe]@xmath55 indices of galaxies to the values of theoretical stellar populations and have taken the effects of young populations ( ysps ) into account .",
    "the detailed data about the sample galaxies can be obtained on request to the authors or via the cds in the future . from panels ( a ) and ( c ) of fig .",
    "3 , we find that the stellar ages and metallicities determined by colours are respectively smaller and somewhat richer than those determined by lick indices .",
    "the reason is that there are composite stellar populations ( csps ) in galaxies and the ysps make the results derived from colours bias younger and richer in metal compared to those of the dominant populations ( dsps ) of galaxies @xcite . in detail , because the age of a ysp affects the colours of a star system more stronger than the mass fraction of the ysp , ysps with only a few percent stellar mass can make the colour - fitted stellar populations younger and metal - richer than dsps of galaxies if the ysps are not too old . then in panels ( b ) and ( d ) fig .",
    "3 , we compare the stellar - population parameters measured by colours and corrected for the effects of ysps to those determined by lick indices . the correction is accomplished using the possible distributions of the differences between the stellar - population parameters of the dsps of csps and the parameters derived from two colours of csps @xcite . the above distributions were obtained by a statistical method , in which the fractions of ysps were assumed to depend on the ages of the dsps and ysps , and the fraction of a ysp was assumed to decline exponentially with decreasing age of the ysp ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in special ,",
    "the distributions can be used to give a rough correction for the effects of ysps . here , we get the corrected stellar age of a galaxy by submitting from the colour - fitted result a random value that fits to the distribution of the difference between the stellar ages of dsps and those derived from two colours .",
    "a similar method is used to get the corrected stellar metallicities . for more clearly",
    ", we show the distributions of the uncorrected and corrected parameters in fig .",
    "we are shown that after the correction , the distributions of stellar ages obtained by two methods , especially the peaks , become more similar after the correction ( fig .",
    "however , it is also shown that the distributions of stellar metallicities obtained by various methods are similar .",
    "therefore , it seems that without any correction , we can get correct distributions of stellar metallicities of luminous early - type galaxies via colours .",
    "note that because we used a least - square fitting method similar to @xcite and @xcite , the effects of the uncertainties of colours were not taken into account here .",
    "the uncertainties may effect the above distributions slightly .",
    "furthermore , the dust may contribute to the difference between the two kinds of results .",
    "in fact , a small amount of dust can make @xmath48 colours of galaxies redder , and then lead to additional uncertainties in stellar ages . in detail , a dust of e(@xmath56 ) = 0.05 will change the @xmath48 and @xmath36 colours about 0.12 mag , and then lead to about 2.5 gyr age uncertainty and 0.015 metallicity uncertainty .",
    "in addition , the average stellar - population parameters obtained by photometry and spectroscopy are found to be similar ( about 7 gyr for age and 0.02 for metallicity ) .",
    "therefore , although it is difficult to get the accurate stellar - population parameters of each galaxy via colours , we can get reliable values for the average age and metallicity of a sample of galaxies , as can the distributions of the two parameters .      because some colours are shown to be sensitive to stellar age or metallicity",
    ", we can possibly use colours in conjunction with lick indices to study stellar - population parameters .",
    "for example , we can use a metallicity - sensitive colour together with an age - sensitive lick index to estimate the stellar ages and metallicities of galaxies .",
    "we have a try in this work .",
    "the above galaxy sample are used here .",
    "the stellar - population parameters are fitted via h@xmath50 and @xmath36 indices using the same method as sect 5.1 .",
    "the results are compared to those determined by @xcite in panels ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .",
    "5 . note that the results did not correct for the effects of young populations .",
    "we see that using h@xmath50 instead of @xmath48 , the stellar ages obtained are closer to those of @xcite .",
    "this means that line indices are affected by young populations of galaxies more slightly .",
    "however , the fitted stellar metallicities of some galaxies are poorer than those obtained by @xcite",
    ". it should mainly result from the effects of ysps in galaxies .",
    "in fact , ysps make the @xmath36 colour of galaxies obviously bluer than those of the dsps , but they affect the h@xmath50 index more slightly . when @xmath36 is used in conjunction with h@xmath50 to estimate the stellar - population parameters of galaxies , the two indices will lead to more poor metallicities compared those determined by a colour pair .",
    "one can see a h@xmath50 versus [ mgfe ] grid for comparison , as the shape of h@xmath50 versus @xmath48 grid is similar to that of h@xmath50 versus [ mgfe ] .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to use photometry in conjunction with spectroscopy to estimate the metallicities of galaxies",
    ". furthermore , we tried to give some final results for the stellar - population parameters of our sample galaxies using h@xmath50 , [ mgfe ] , @xmath48 and @xmath36 indices together . because the uncertainties of colours and lick indices are different , we use a @xmath57 fit ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) to estimate the stellar - population parameters .",
    "the stellar metallicities are shown to be different significantly from those determined by previous work .",
    "the comparison can be seen in panels ( c ) and ( d ) of fig .",
    "5 . the results did not correct for the effects of young populations , either .",
    "because the results of @xcite have taken the effects of ysps into account , the above results are certainly affected by the ysps in galaxies .",
    "the results may also effected by the large observational uncertainties .",
    "however , it seems that the ysps effect the results stronger , because when we tried to estimate the stellar - population parameters via h@xmath50 and [ mgfe ] , we got poorer metallicities than those of the previous work . as a whole , our results suggest that colour pairs can be used more conveniently for estimating the stellar - population parameters of distant galaxies , as colours can be obtained more easily than spectra and can constrain the stellar - population parameters with uncertainties similar to lick indices ( typically 4 gyr for age and 0.015 for metallicity ) .",
    "we investigated the relative metallicity sensitivities of ab system colours relating to @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 bands in the first place .",
    "then we studied the abilities of colour pairs for constraining luminosity - weighed stellar ages and metallicities .",
    "the results showed that [ @xmath58 and [ @xmath13 are the best colour pairs for breaking the stellar age ",
    "metallicity degeneracy while colour pairs such as @xmath59 , [ @xmath60 , [ @xmath61 , ( u - r)$ ] ] and [ @xmath62 can also be used .",
    "colour pairs [ @xmath12 and [ @xmath63 can measure two stellar - population parameters with small uncertainties ( @xmath64 3.89 gyr , @xmath65 } \\leq$ ] 0.34 dex for typical uncertainties in colours ) .",
    "however , the age uncertainties for old populations ( age @xmath16 4.6 gyrs ) and metal - poor populations ( @xmath15 @xmath14 0.001 ) are always significantly larger than for young populations ( age @xmath14 4.6 gyrs ) and metal - rich populations ( @xmath15 @xmath16 0.001 ) .",
    "the reason is that the colours of some old populations or metal - poor populations are largely indistinguishable within present typical errors .",
    "one can see fig . 3 for comparison .",
    "however , the metallicity uncertainty of metal - poor populations ( about 0.0024 ) is much less than that of other populations ( about 0.015 ) . in the work",
    ", we did not take the uncertainties in theoretical stellar population models into account . a detailed study about it",
    "please refer to the work of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , colours are usually affected by the dust of galaxies , even if early - type ones . a typical effect of dust in early - type galaxies , e(b - v)@xmath66 0.05 , will change the @xmath36 and @xmath48 colours of galaxies about 0.12 mag , and then lead to additional uncertainties in stellar - population parameters ( about 2.5 gyr for age and 0.015 for metallicity ) .",
    "thus it is more suitable to use colours to measure the stellar - population parameters of galaxies with poor dust and gas , e.g. , luminous early - type ones ( with small colour uncertainties ) .",
    "actually , to quantify the age and metallicity errors induced by a typical dust is in study .",
    "when we compare the results determined by photometry with those determined by lick indices , we found that the stellar ages determined by colours are less than those determined by lick indices .",
    "the difference mainly results from the effects of young populations in these galaxies .",
    "we also found that the average uncertainties of stellar - population parameters determined by colours and lick indices are similar ( typically 4 gyr for age and 0.015 for metallicity ) .",
    "therefore , it is actually difficult to get the absolute values of stellar ages and metallicities via colours , but we can get some relative values",
    ". this will be useful for some statistical studies of the stellar populations of galaxies .",
    "in addition , our results suggest that it is better to use colours relating to both @xmath18 and @xmath19 bands than to use those only relating to one of the two kinds of bands for estimating the two stellar - population parameters .",
    "according to the results , we can estimate the stellar - population parameters of some distant galaxies , via the photometry data supplied by , e.g. , sdss and 2mass .",
    "the possible uncertainties of using various colour pairs can be estimated .",
    "the results presented in the paper can also help us to choose suitable bands for the observation of stellar population studies .",
    "we also tried to find some colour pairs that are suitable for estimating the luminosity - weighted ages and metallicities of some special stellar populations .",
    "the results show that some colour pairs for estimating the two stellar - population parameters of young ( age @xmath14 4.6 gyr ) , old ( age @xmath16 4.6 gyr ) , metal - poor ( @xmath15 @xmath14 0.001 ) , and metal - rich ( @xmath15 @xmath16 0.001 ) populations are different .",
    "however , [ @xmath13 can be used to estimate the ages and metallicities of all stellar populations .",
    "although we took the bc03 model for our work , the results can be used for other models as most stellar population synthesis models predict similar colours for the same population .",
    "furthermore , we suggest to choose a colour pair for estimating the two stellar - population parameters of galaxies , although a few colours can give smaller range for the two parameters .",
    "the reason is that galaxies usually contain more than two populations , and via comparing observational colours with predictions of simple stellar populations , we can only measure less stellar ages and richer stellar metallicities for galaxies compared to the dominant stellar populations ( dsps ) of galaxies . for a sample of galaxies ,",
    "the effects of young populations on the ages and metallicities of dominant stellar populations can be roughly corrected and some reliable estimations for the averages and distributions of two stellar - population parameters can be obtained @xcite .    note that the bc03 model is a single stellar population model , which does not take the binary interactions into account .",
    "this is actually different from the real stellar populations of galaxies .",
    "if stars of a population evolve as binaries rather than single stars , the colours of the population will be different with those of a single stellar population .",
    "typically , the @xmath48 and @xmath36 colours predicted by binary stellar populations will be bluer about 0.05 mag than those predicted by single populations .",
    "using binary populations instead of single populations , the stellar ages and metallicities will be about 1.14 gyr older and 0.0093 richer , respectively . a detailed study about this",
    "will be given in the future .",
