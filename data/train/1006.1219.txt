    "the main objective of the lhc is to reveal the nature of the mechanism breaking the electroweak symmetry .",
    "this requires not only a determination of the higgs mass and couplings , but also a search for additional particles that may be related to new dynamics or symmetries present at the tev scale .",
    "the top - quark sector appears then as a promising place to start the search , as it is there where the ew symmetry is broken the most .",
    "generically , the large top - quark yukawa coupling with the higgs boson ( @xmath11 ) also implies large couplings with the extra physics .",
    "for example , in susy extensions @xmath11 comes together with neutral scalar ( @xmath3 ) and pseudoscalar ( @xmath4 ) fields@xcite . or in little higgs ( lh ) models , a global symmetry in the higgs and the top - quark sectors introduces a scalar singlet and an extra @xmath7 quark@xcite . in all cases these scalar fields have large yukawa couplings that could imply a sizeable production rate in hadron collisions and a dominant decay channel into @xmath12 .",
    "the potential to observe new physics in @xmath13 at hadron colliders has been discussed in previous literature@xcite . in general , any heavy @xmath14channel resonance with a significant branching ratio to @xmath12 will introduce distortions . in the diagram depicted in fig.[fig1 ] the intermediate scalar is produced at one loop , but the gauge and yukawa couplings are all strong .     production.__,title=\"fig : \" ]    in@xcite we give the expressions for the leading - order differential cross section for @xmath15 through a scalar and a pseudoscalar , @xmath16 . to have an observable effect it is essential that the width @xmath17 is small .",
    "this is precisely the reason why the effect on @xmath13 of a very heavy standard higgs @xmath11 would be irrelevant . a 500 gev higgs boson would couple strongly to the top quark , but even stronger to itself .",
    "its decay into would - be goldstone bosons would then dominate , implying a total decay width of around 60 gev .    to have a smaller width and a larger effect the mass of the resonance must _ not _ be ew .",
    "in particular , susy or lh models provide a new scale and massive higgses with no need for large scalar self - couplings .",
    "susy incorporates two higgs doublets , and after ewsb there are two neutral bosons ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) in addition to the light higgs .",
    "the mass of these two fields is not ew , so they are _ naturally _ heavy enough to decay in @xmath1 .",
    "their mass difference depends on the @xmath18 parameter and the stop masses and trilinears in addition to @xmath19@xcite .",
    "varying these parameters , for @xmath20 gev we obtain typical values of @xmath21 between @xmath22 and @xmath23 gev .     for @xmath24 and susy bosons of mass @xmath25 gev ( left ) or @xmath26 , @xmath27 gev ( right ) .",
    "dashes provide the narrow - width approximation and dots the standard model cross section.__,title=\"fig : \" ]   for @xmath24 and susy bosons of mass @xmath25 gev ( left ) or @xmath26 , @xmath27 gev ( right ) .",
    "dashes provide the narrow - width approximation and dots the standard model cross section.__,title=\"fig : \" ]    in fig.[fig2]-left we observe an average 5.5% excess and 8.1% deficit in the 5 gev intervals before and after @xmath28 gev , respectively . there",
    "the position of the peaks and dips caused by @xmath3 and @xmath4 overlap _ constructively_. in contrast , in fig.[fig2]-right their mass difference implies a partial cancellation between the dip caused by @xmath4 and the peak of @xmath3 .",
    "quarks from @xmath29 and @xmath30 collisions at @xmath28 gev .",
    "we include ( dashes ) the distribution from @xmath30 at the peak and the dip of fig.[fig2]-left.__,title=\"fig : \" ]    from fig.[fig3 ] we argue that different cuts could be applied to reduce the background for @xmath12 production at the lhc or even to optimize the contribution from @xmath31 versus @xmath29 , but not to enhance the relative effect of the scalars on @xmath32 .",
    "in lh models the higgs appears as a pseudo - goldstone boson of a global symmetry broken spontaneously at the scale @xmath33 gev .",
    "the global symmetry introduces an extra @xmath7 quark and a massive scalar singlet @xmath5 , the _ higgs _ of the symmetry broken at @xmath6 . once the electroweak vev is included the doublet and singlet higgses mix@xcite .",
    "the extra higgs @xmath5 is somehow similar to the heavier scalar in a doublet plus singlet model , with the doublet component growing with @xmath34 . if @xmath35 is sizeable so is its coupling to the top quark .",
    "the coupling to the extra @xmath7 quark is stronger , but if @xmath5 is lighter than @xmath36 then its main decay mode will be into @xmath12 . therefore , @xmath5 is a naturally heavy ( @xmath37 ) but narrow scalar resonance with large couplings to quarks and an order one braching ratio to @xmath1 .",
    "in@xcite we examine this case in detail .",
    "the results are similar to the ones obtained for susy bosons of the same mass .",
    "let us now estimate the invariant mass distribution of @xmath12 events ( @xmath13 ) in @xmath38 collisions at the lhc .",
    "we will take a center of mass energy of 7 tev and 1 fb@xmath8 luminosity and we will not apply any cuts . at these energies the cross section @xmath39 is dominated by @xmath31 fusion ( 90% ) .    in fig.[fig4 ]",
    "we observe a 5% excess followed by a 9% deficit , with smaller deviations as @xmath13 separates from the mass of the extra higgs bosons . in fig.[fig5 ] we find that changing the binning is important in order to optimize the effect .",
    "events in @xmath38 collisions at 7 tev and 1 fb@xmath8 for @xmath25 gev and @xmath24 distributed in 5 gev bins.__,title=\"fig : \" ]     in the number of events respect to the standard prediction for two different binning ( @xmath25 gev and @xmath24).__,title=\"fig : \" ]   in the number of events respect to the standard prediction for two different binning ( @xmath25 gev and @xmath24).__,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "in models with an extended higgs sector the extra bosons tend to have large couplings with the top quark that imply a sizeable one - loop production rate at hadron colliders .",
    "if the mass of these bosons is not ew but comes from a new scale ( _ e.g. _ , the susy or the global symmetry - breaking scales ) , then they may decay predominantly into @xmath12 .",
    "we have studied their effect on the @xmath12 invariant mass distribution at 7 tev and 1 fb@xmath8 .",
    "we have considered the deviations due to the neutral bosons @xmath4 and @xmath3 of the mssm , and to the scalar @xmath5 associated to the scale @xmath6 in lh models . in all cases the interference dominates , invalidating the narrow - width approximation .",
