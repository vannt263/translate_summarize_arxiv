    "while density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite in conjunction with the local density approximation ( lda ) is remarkably successful in predicting ground - state properties of a wide range of real materials , it has been found unable to provide the correct description of so - called strongly correlated materials ( transition metal oxides , many actinide and lanthanide - based materials , high t@xmath2 superconductors ) even on a qualitative level . in order to overcome these shortcomings of the traditional dft - lda scheme ,",
    "a combination of the dft - based band structure techniques with dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite has been proposed @xcite . in dmft one",
    "introduces a strong local coulomb interaction acting between electrons of a correlated band ( for example , the @xmath3band in transition- metal oxides or the @xmath4band in actinides ) .",
    "the self - energy is found by first mapping a full solid onto a quantum impurity model involving a single atom hybridized with an effective bath , and solving this effective model using many - body techniques .",
    "this self - energy is then promoted to all lattice sites , therefore restoring the translational invariance of the crystal . as a result",
    "one obtains the fully interacting green s function for the system , from which a wide range of properties can be extracted .",
    "starting from the end of the 90 s , this new lda+dmft approach to the electronic structure of strongly correlated materials has been rapidly developing , and a number of different implementations have been proposed and applied to calculations of the spectral and , in some cases , thermodynamic properties , of mott insulators , ferromagnetic 3-@xmath5 metals , ce , pu , and other actinide systems ( for reviews , see @xcite ) . up to date most lda+dmft calculations have been performed using a partially self - consistent scheme , where the local self - energy is obtained from a dmft calculation with the _ fixed _ lda charge density , and , hence , with a _ fixed",
    "_ lda hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , in this simplified scheme one neglects the impact of the strong on - site coulomb interaction on the charge distribution .    implementing full self - consistency over the charge density",
    "is a somewhat delicate task .",
    "several fully self - consistent lda+dmft schemes have been discussed in the literature @xcite , while only two actual implementations have appeared up to date .",
    "the first one , due to savrasov and kotliar  @xcite , is based on the full - potential lmto method . in order to compute the lda+dmft charge density one has to construct from the lda hamiltonian and the dmft local self - energy a local green s function of the interacting system . in ref .",
    "[ ] this task has been accomplished by first finding the ( right- and left- ) eigenfunctions and eigenvectors of the kohn - sham hamiltonian combined with the self - energy @xmath6 and then performing the brillouin zone integration by means of the tetrahedron method @xcite .",
    "as the self - energy is a complex function , this scheme requires the diagonalization of a non - hermitian matrix for each @xmath7point and matsubara frequency , which is a computationally demanding task .",
    "another scheme has been proposed by minar _",
    "@xcite on the basis of the kkr green s function method .",
    "their approach requires solving the radial dirac equation with the self - energy being added to the lda atomic potential .",
    "generally the self - energy is a non - diagonal matrix , therefore an additional coupling is generated between dirac equations for different magnetic quantum numbers @xmath8 , making the solution of the dirac equation a highly non - trivial task .",
    "_ applied their scheme to calculations of the feni binary alloy , which forms a cubic lattice . hence , in this case , both the green s function and self - energy are diagonal in the orbital indexes , and there is no additional coupling generated in the dirac equation .",
    "however , this problem will certainly arise for lower symmetry lattices or @xmath4electron compounds .",
    "in the present article , we propose and apply a relatively simple implementation of the fully self - consistent lda+dmft method .",
    "the charge density ( including correlation effects described by the many - body self - energy ) is expressed in terms of a @xmath9-dependent momentum - distribution matrix @xmath10 , which is obtained from the many - body green s function by summing over frequency .",
    "furthermore , using a linear muffin - tin orbital basis set , we reduce the calculation of the charge density to that of three moments , involving this matrix and the kohn - sham hamiltonian itself . in order to calculate the total energy , a functional of both the charge density and the on - site components of the green s function associated with local orbitals can be used  @xcite , as previously discussed by savrasov and kotliar . in all these calculations ,",
    "obtaining the charge density and total energy with sufficient accuracy requires a careful treatment of the high - frequency tails of the green s function and self - energy , and we derive here appropriate formulas to handle this issue .    in order to illustrate this approach , and to assess the importance of full self - consistency on the charge density , we perform in this article fully - selfconsistent lda+dmft calculations of the density of states , the band structure , and the volume - dependence of the total energy of two materials : @xmath1-cerium and cerium sesquioxide ce@xmath11o@xmath12 .",
    "the quasi - localized @xmath13-electrons are treated using dmft in conjunction with the hubbard - i approximation as a quantum impurity solver  @xcite .",
    "our theory reproduces the experimentally observed splitting of the rare - earth @xmath13-band into occupied lower and empty upper hubbard bands , while the conventional lda calculations incorrectly predict this band to be pinned at the fermi level @xcite .",
    "we show that the self - consistency over the charge density shifts significantly the positions of the hubbard bands ( in comparison to using a frozen lda charge density ) , in both @xmath1-ce and ce@xmath11o@xmath12 .",
    "it is therefore important for the correct description of spectral and optical properties of those materials .",

    "the lda+dmft approach to electronic structure is based on two key quantities : the charge density @xmath14 and the local green s function of the solid , or more precisely the projection @xmath15 of the full green s function onto a single atomic site and on the subspace of correlated orbitals .",
    "both quantities have to be determined self - consistently , following an iterative cycle which is summarized on fig .",

    "hence , the functional dependence of @xmath20 on @xmath14 is kept identical to that of conventional dft . in practice ,",

    "the electron creation operator at a point @xmath31 in the solid can be expanded on this basis as : ^ ( ) = _ , l ^*_l()c_l^and the ks hamiltonian reads : h_ks=_l h^ks_ll ( ) c^_lc_l [ eq : ks_lmto ]    in the lda+dmft approach , this hamiltonian is supplemented by many - body terms .",
    "these many - body terms act in the subspace generated by a set of orbitals corresponding in practice to the orbitals ( e.g @xmath5 or @xmath13-orbitals ) for which a description beyond dft - lda is needed ( note however that all other orbital components in the valence will also be modified indirectly by feedback effects of the self - energy associated with the correlated ones ) . for simplicity ,",
    "we restrict the discussion here to the case of one ` correlated ' atom per unit cell .",
    "the orbitals generating the correlated subset need not coincide with basis functions in general  @xcite .",
    "however in the present work , we do choose them as a specific subset @xmath32 of the lmtos .",
    "hence , @xmath30 runs over all orbitals retained in the valence , while @xmath33 runs only over the ` correlated ' subset ( denoted by @xmath34 in the following ) .",
    "the many - body hamiltonian considered in lda+dmft reads : h = h_ks - h_dc+h_u [ eq : mb_ham ] in this expression , @xmath35 ( corresponding to a one - body potential @xmath36 ) is a double - counting correction .",
    "indeed , some of the local coulomb interaction effects are already taken into account in the exchange - correlation energy , and hence in @xmath37 .",
    "the many - body terms @xmath38 act in the subset of correlated orbitals only .",
    "they correspond to matrix elements of the coulomb interaction , and will in general involve general 2-particle terms of the form @xmath39 .",

    "the key idea ( which can be viewed as a representability assumption ) is that @xmath16 can be represented by an effective local model , which is a multi - band generalization of an anderson impurity model described by the effective action :    @xmath42_{ab}(\\tau-\\tau')\\,c_{b}(\\tau ' ) + \\int d\\tau\\ , h_u % \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{ab}\\,u_{ab}\\,\\int^{\\beta}_{0}d\\tau\\ , % n_{a}(\\tau)n_{b}(\\tau ) \\label{smulti}\\ ] ]    in this expression , @xmath43 is the dynamical mean - field , analogous to the familiar weiss mean - field in classical mean - field theory , the key difference being that here it is a frequency - dependent ( i.e energy - scale dependent ) quantity .",

    "the dynamical mean - field @xmath43 ( or @xmath47 ) is determined from a self - consistency condition , which expresses that the impurity - model green s function faithfully represents the local green s function in the solid projected onto the correlated subset , and hence that the two quantities should coincide .",
    "furthermore , an approximation is made , namely that the many - body self - energy has components on the basis set which are ( i ) local and ( ii ) non - zero only in the correlated subspace , so that it also coincides with its impurity model counterpart and takes the form : ^_ll(z)=_, (    cc 0 & 0 + 0 & ^imp_ab(z ) +    ) [ eq : sigma_matrix ] the impurity model green s function and self - energy are defined as : g_ab^imp(- ) - tc^_a()c_b()_imp , ^imp_ab _ ab - [ g_imp^-1]_ab [ eq : imp_g_sigma ] in which the average indicated by @xmath48 is taken with respect to the effective action ( [ smulti ] ) . the self - consistency condition which determines @xmath43",

    "note that , even though the self - energy matrix has only components in the subspace of correlated orbitals , components of the green s function corresponding to all valence orbitals ( @xmath55 ) are modified due to the matrix inversion . hence there is a feedback of correlation effects onto these orbitals as well .    at the end of the dmft cycle ,",

    "width=10 ]      as discussed in detail in section [ lda+dmft - scheme ] , since dmft emphasizes local correlations , one needs to construct a localized basis set , i.e basis functions which are centered on the atomic positions @xmath28 in the crystal lattice . up to now , most implementations have used basis sets based on linear muffin - tin orbitals  @xcite ( lmtos ) @xmath65 .",
    "these basis sets offer the advantage to carry over the physical intuition of atomic orbitals from the isolated atom to the solid .",
    "the lmto method has been extensively used in electronic structure calculations and thoroughly described in review articles  @xcite .",
    "here we only outline the main features of the lmto basis set which are relevant to the selfconsistent implementation of the lda+dmft scheme .",
    "mt - methods suppose that the crystal potential is spherically symmetric near each atomic site and constant in the interstitial region between atoms .",
    "the conventional lmto method employs a further simplification , the atomic - sphere approximation ( asa ) , which assumes that the whole space of a crystal is filled with atomic spheres and neglects both the overlap and interstitial spaces .",
    "the lmto basis is constructed from the solution ( partial wave ) @xmath66 of the spherically symmetric ks potential inside the atomic sphere located at @xmath28 for a certain energy @xmath67 ( typically , the center of gravity of a band ) and its energy derivative @xmath68 .",
    "the angular dependence is provided by a spherical harmonic @xmath69 , corresponding to the orbital and magnetic quantum numbers l ) .",
    "the expression for a linearized mt - orbital is : @xmath70 where the first and second terms in the right - hand side of this equation are usually called the `` head '' and `` tail '' , respectively .",
    "the superscript @xmath71 designates a particular lmto representation ( the so - called `` screened '' non - orthogonal representation ) , which is defined by the choice of the envelope functions for the interstitial .",
    "we have actually employed here the so - called nearly - orthogonal @xmath1-representation  @xcite , where @xmath72 is chosen as : h^_llh^ks_ll - e___ll [ def_small_h ] using the orthogonality property of the partial wave and its energy derivative @xmath73 one may easily show @xcite that the head of the lmto in the @xmath1-representation is orthogonal to any lmto centered on any other site up to a second - order contribution due to the overlap of the energy derivatives of the partial waves .",
    "then the basis can be made completely orthogonal by means of an numerical orthogonalization , for example , the lwdin transformation @xcite .",
    "the use of an orthogonal basis is technically simpler when implementing lda+dmft ( although a non - orthogonal basis may be more advisable in principle since it is expected to reduce the range of interaction terms ) .",
    "a numerical orthogonalization usually introduces undesirable mixing between strongly and weakly correlated states . because the lmto basis in the @xmath1 representation is already nearly - orthogonal , the inter - orbital mixing are small however .",
    "one of the main advantages of the lmto technique is the small size of its basis .",
    "it can be made even smaller through use of the downfolding procedure @xcite , which allows to reduce the size of the hamiltonian by folding down those states which are located well above the valence band .",
    "this technique substantially reduces the computational effort , a gain which is especially important in the case of the time - consuming lda+dmft calculations .",
    "the down - folded lmto can be expressed as follows : @xmath74 where @xmath29 labels `` active '' orbitals , which are explicitly included in the hamiltonian , @xmath75 runs over the set of downfolded orbitals , the matrix @xmath76 can be expressed through the structure constants and potential parameters @xcite .",
    "following ref .",
    "[ ] we neglect the energy dependence of the downfolded orbitals @xmath77 . in the case of a periodic crystal ,",
    "one may rewrite expression ( [ hi_down ] ) at each @xmath9-point in the brillouin zone as : @xmath78      in this section , we describe the practical implementation of the calculation of the lda+dmft charge density in the lmto basis set .",

    "this expression can be further simplified if the atomic - sphere approximation ( asa ) is used , in which the potential is approximated as spherically symmetric within the mt - spheres . in accordance with this approximation ,",
    "crossed terms between different angular momentum channels can be neglected .",

    "[ ] evaluation of the matsubara sums over the high - frequency tails have been treated in details , however the approach proposed there is applicable only if the self - energy is calculated by means of an analytic technique . due to the wide spread of numerical dmft solvers ( for example , quantum monte carlo ) , it is highly desirable to have a `` solver - independent '' technique for accurate evaluations of matsubara sums , which we describe in this chapter .",
    "we shall isolate the first two terms in the high - frequency expansion of the self - energy matrix , which is thus decomposed as : [ sig_an ] ( ) = ( i)+ + _ num ( ) _ an ( ) + _ num ( ) in this expression , the numerically determined @xmath114 will be neglected for matsubara frequencies larger than a certain cutoff @xmath115 , while the high - frequency contribution @xmath116 will be treated analytically when performing frequency sums .",
    "one may extract the matrices @xmath117 and @xmath118 ( the latter being actually diagonal in the present case ) from the real and imaginary parts of the self - energy at the cutoff frequency @xmath119 , or use a more sophisticated way for fitting them .",
    "a similar decomposition can be applied to the green s function : @xmath120^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath121 is again zero for matsubara frequencies larger than the cutoff frequency . in the analytical part of the green s function it is sufficient to keep only the dominant term in the self - energy @xmath117 .",
    "then the matrix @xmath122 is hermitian , and we designate its eigenvectors and eigenvalues as @xmath123 and @xmath124 , respectively , so that : [ g_an ] ( , ) = _ num(,)+_m . in order to evaluate the frequency sum in ( [ occ_mat ] ) we carry out the summation of @xmath125 up to the cutoff frequency , while other frequency sums are performed analytically . by inserting ( [ sig_an ] ) and ( [ g_an ] ) in the formula for the migdal energy ( [ mig_enr ] ) one obtains the following expressions of practical use : @xmath126 , \\\\ & & \\nonumber \\langle h_{u}\\rangle ^{(2)}=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\vk}\\sum_{m } \\frac{\\bra x_m^\\vk\\vert\\hat{\\sigma}(i\\infty)\\vert x_m^\\vk\\ket}{1+e^{-\\beta\\lambda_m^\\vk } } , \\\\ & & \\nonumber \\langle h_{u}\\rangle ^{(3)}= \\frac{1}{4}\\sum_{\\vk}\\sum_{m}\\frac{\\bra x_m^\\vk\\vert\\hat{a}\\vert x_m^\\vk\\ket } { \\lambda_m^\\vk}\\frac{1-e^{\\beta\\lambda_m^\\vk}}{1+e^{\\beta\\lambda_m^\\vk}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the hubbard - i quantum impurity solver",
    "@xcite employed in the present work is not constrained to the matsubara frequencies , and it can in fact be equally well used for calculating the self - energy at any general complex energy .",
    "hence at zero temperature one may easily rewrite frequency sums in the expressions for the occupancy matrix ( [ occ_mat ] ) and migdal energy ( [ edmft ] ) in a form , which is suitable for a summation over the poles of the gf ( and the self - energy in the case of migdal energy ) on the real axis : n^_ll= g_ll(,z ) ,    h_u = tr dz , where integration is performed over the contour in the complex energy plane , which encloses valence - band energy poles .",
    "therefore , within the hubbard - i approach and at zero temperature one may completely avoid the problem of summation of the high - frequency tails .",
    "we have applied both the finite temperature matsubara temperature summation and contour integration techniques in the fully self - consistent lda+dmft calculations of @xmath1-ce and ce@xmath11o@xmath12 .      the last term in eq.([eq : mb_ham ] )",

    ". in the quasiatomic ( spherical ) approximation the slatter integrals can be expressed through only two parameters @xmath133 and @xmath134 ( see ref .  ) .",
    "in addition to the spherical approximation one often makes a further simplification and keeps only density - density interactions ( we employ this simplification in the current version of our hubbard - i impurity solver , though in general it is not necessary ) .",
    "we shall limit ourselves here to this case and use : h_u = _ _ mm u_mm^ _ m^_m^ [ eq : hu ] with the effective two - index matrix derived from a more general 4-index form as follows : u_mm^=u_mmmm , u_mm^=u_mm^=u_mmmm-u_mmmm [ eq : u_matrix ]    next , we discuss the impurity solver that we use in practice in this article . both materials that we shall consider for illustrative purposes ( 2o3 and @xmath1-ce ) have nominally an @xmath135 configuration , and the @xmath13-electron is actually localized .",
    "the practical solution of the dmft equation can be simplified considerably by choosing an approximate ` impurity solver ' appropriate to this localized character .",
    "the simplest of those is the ` hubbard - i ' approximation . in this approximation ,",
    "the self - energy is approximated by its ` atomic limit ' , in which the hybridization function @xmath136 is neglected .",
    "one should still correctly identify however the effective atomic levels entering the weiss dynamical mean - field @xmath137_{mm'}=z-\\epsilon_{mm'}-\\delta_{mm'}(z)$ ] ( with @xmath138 ) .",
    "for this purpose , we can perform a high - frequency expansion of the self - consistency equation ( [ eq : scc_esc_dmft],[eq : new_g0 ] ) and request that @xmath139 vanishes at high frequency , which leads to : _ mm=-_mm+_h^ks_mm ( ) - v^dc_mm [ eq : effective_level ] in the present case , this is actually a diagonal matrix of effective atomic levels @xmath140 . these levels must be recalculated iteratively , as they change upon updating the chemical potential .",
    "hence , the effective atomic hamiltonian reads : h_at^eff= _ , m_m _ m + h_u [ eq : hateff ] this hamiltonian can be diagonalized , yielding ( many - body ) energy levels @xmath141 s and eigenstates @xmath142 , from which the atomic green s function can be constructed as : @xmath143_{mm ' } = \\delta_{mm'}\\,\\frac{1}{{\\cal z}}\\sum_{ab } \\frac{|\\langle a|d_m^\\dagger|b\\rangle|^2}{z+e_b - e_a}(e^{-\\beta e_a}+e^{-\\beta e_b } ) \\,\\,\\,,\\,\\,\\ , { \\cal z } = \\sum_a e^{-\\beta e_a}\\ ] ] the atomic self - energy is obtained from @xmath144 .",

    ", the lda+dmft loop takes the following form .",
    "starting from @xmath150 at a given stage of the iteration , the effective atomic levels are calculated according to ( [ eq : effective_level ] ) and the local atomic green s function calculated by diagonalizing the effective atomic hamiltonian ( [ eq : hateff ] ) . the full green s function is then formed as ( [ eq : green_hubbard1 ] ) and the momentum distribution matrix @xmath151 calculated .",
    "the chemical potential is then updated so that @xmath152 yields the appropriate total number of electrons , and the updated charge density is obtained by calculating the moments as described in sec .  [ sec : density ] .",
    "the ks equations are then solved to yield a new @xmath150 and this process is iterated until convergence of both @xmath14 and of the effective atomic levels @xmath153 .",
    "finally , we discuss the `` double - counting '' correction @xmath35 .",
    "this correction must be introduced , since the contribution of interactions between the correlated orbitals to the total energy is already partially included in the exchange - correlation potential derived from @xmath154 .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to derive this term explicitly , since the energy within dft is a functional of the total electron density , which combines all orbitals in a non - linear manner . in practice ,",
    "the most commonly used form of the double - counting term is ( for other choices , see e.g  [ ] ) : @xmath155 , \\label{eq : dc_potential}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath156 is the total occupancy in the correlated shell @xmath157 ( i.e the @xmath13-shell in practice in this article ) .",
    "one issue arises here , which is which value of @xmath158 must actually be used in ( [ eq : dc_potential ] ) .",
    "when solving the dmft equations with a numerically exact solver , it would seem ( from the previous functional - based derivation ) that @xmath158 should be the occupancy of the @xmath13-shell obtained at self - consistency .",
    "however , we have found this to be inappropriate when using the hubbard - i approximation as a solver and leading to too small equilibrium volumes .",
    "instead , we note that the hubbard - i solver treats an effective isolated atom , which has this a frozen occupancy taking integer values at @xmath159 .",
    "hence , a natural choice within hubbard - i is to choose this frozen integer occupancy in the double - counting correction . for the @xmath135 materials in the paramagnetic phase treated in this article ( @xmath160 ) , so that the hund s coupling therefore drops out of @xmath35 which reads simply : @xmath161 this also implies that the @xmath133-dependent contribution of the double counting correction in the total energy actually vanishes for @xmath135 compounds within the hubbard - i approximation , and for this choice of double - counting potential .",
    "we have applied the lmto - based fully self - consistent lda+dmft technique in order to calculate the density of states and thermodynamical properties of the cerium sesquioxide ce@xmath11o@xmath12 and pure ce in its @xmath1-phase .",
    "the main aim of these calculations is to validate our implementation of the fully self - consistent lda+dmft technique , as well as to study the impact of the charge self - consistency on spectral and thermodynamic properties .",
    "hence , it is desirable to avoid additional complications due to the use of sophisticated and computationally expensive quantum impurity solvers .",
    "while the ce 4@xmath13 band can not be properly modeled by conventional lda techniques , due to its essentially atomic - like ( localized ) character , the electronic correlations on the 4@xmath13 shell can be treated by means of the simplest `` strong - coupling '' hubbard - i ( hi )  @xcite approximate impurity solver , described in the previous section .",
    "therefore for our purposes these two strongly correlated rare - earth compounds , with nominally one localized @xmath13-electron , appear to be a suitable choice .",
    "both pure cerium and the oxide ce@xmath11o@xmath12 are well studied theoretically and experimentally , because they raise questions of fundamental interest ( e.g. concerning the @xmath71-@xmath1 transition in ce @xcite ) as well as for technological reasons ( for example , ce - oxides are used for oxygen storage in solid - oxide fuel cells @xcite ) .",

    "antiferromagnetically , with a nel temperature ( 9 k ) which is several orders of magnitude smaller than the gap .",
    "it is thus clear that the antiferromagnetic order is not the driving force behind the insulating character of this material .",
    "rather , strong correlations open up a gap among the @xmath0 states , and this compound can therefore be viewed as an f - electron based mott insulator . as for all such materials , it is a challenge for conventional electronic structure calculations to describe the opening of the correlation - induced gap .",
