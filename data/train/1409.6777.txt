    "the dqc1 model is believed to be a very restricted , but still genuinely quantum , computing model  a _ sub - universal _ quantum computing model whose power is something between classical computation and universal quantum computation .",
    "it is a long - standing open problem whether efficient classical simulation is possible for the dqc1 model , posed already in the first paper of the dqc1 model by knill and laflamme  @xcite",
    ".    with the development of quantum algorithms , proving hardness of classical simulations of quantum computations , even in restricted quantum computing models , becomes a very fundamental methodology for clarifying the power of quantum computing .",
    "recently , a number of studies focused on the hardness of _ weak _ simulation of sub - universal quantum computing models under some reasonable assumptions  @xcite .",
    "namely , a plausible assumption in complexity theory leads to the impossibility of efficient sampling by a classical computer according to an output probability distribution generatable with a quantum computing model . among them",
    "are the iqp model  @xcite and the boson sampling  @xcite , both of which are proved hard for classical computers to weakly simulate , unless the polynomial - time hierarchy collapses to the third level .",
    "an interesting question to ask is whether a similar result holds even for the dqc1 model .",
    "very recently , morimae , fujii and fitzsimons  @xcite approached to answering the question .",
    "they focused on the dqc1@xmath6 model , the generalization of the dqc1 model that allows @xmath7 output qubits to be measured at the end of the computation , and showed that the dqc1@xmath6 model with @xmath8 can not be weakly simulated unless the polynomial - time hierarchy collapses to the third level .",
    "their proof is based on a postselection argument that fictitiously projects a state onto a specific branch of the superposition with unit probability . the complexity class  @xmath9 corresponding to bounded - error quantum polynomial - time computations with postselection is known equivalent to @xmath10  @xcite . a key technique in ref .",
    "@xcite was a dqc1@xmath6-type computation with postselection that simulates any given quantum circuit : by using a generalized toffoli gate and the postselection over a single clean qubit , one can retrieve from the completely mixed state the ideal state in which all the qubits are in state  @xmath11 . hence , the output of any quantum circuit with postselection can be simulated by the dqc1@xmath12-type computation by measuring three qubits in total : one qubit is measured for the postselection to pick up the ideal all - zero state , another qubit is measured for the postselection of the quantum circuit to be simulated , and yet another qubit is measured to read out the output of the simulated circuit .",
    "this means that the dqc@xmath13 model with postselection also has the computational power equivalent to @xmath14 . by an argument similar to that in ref .",

    "the simulation of @xmath21 proceeds as follows :    start from the initial state @xmath24 , and flip the first qubit ( the clean qubit ) if the last @xmath3 qubits ( the completely mixed states ) are in state @xmath25 .    conditioned on the first qubit being @xmath26 ,",
