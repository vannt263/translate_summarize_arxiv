    "achieving rapid development in integrated photonic circuits depends on the all - optical elements , which are essential for high - speed processing of light signals .",
    "nonreciprocal light propagation is an indispensable common trait for some optical elements , such as optical diodes , optical isolator , circulator , etc .",
    "for example , the optical diode permits the light transport in only one direction but not the opposite direction .",
    "the successful design of nonreciprocal light propagation devices relies on the breaking of the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "thus , nonreciprocal light propagation is inherently difficult , even in theory because of the time - reversal symmetry of light - matter interaction @xcite .",
    "motivated by the tremendous application of nonreciprocal electrical current propagation , an immense attention has been paid to the study of nonreciprocal light propagation . as a traditional method ,",
    "a material with strong magneto - optical effects ( faraday rotation ) is often used to break the time - reversal symmetry for some optical devices @xcite . however",
    ", unfortunately the requirement of the magneto - optical effect is the big size components and strong external magnetic fields , which are harmful for the on - chip optical nonreciprocal devices . beyond that",
    ", one can also break the time - reversal symmetry and design the nonreciprocal optical devices by time - dependent effects @xcite , unbalanced quantum coupling @xcite or optical nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "the ubiquitous optical nonlinearity in different optical systems has been extensively studied and further adopted in design of nonreciprocal light propagation devices .",
    "for example , many schemes have been reported through the nonlinearity of the waveguides , such as the second order nonlinearity @xmath0 @xcite , dispersion - engineered chalcogenide @xcite , raman amplification @xcite and so on .    on the other hand , duce to the high - quality factor @xmath1 and small mode volume @xmath2 of optical microcavities @xcite ,",
    "it has attracted considerable interest for implementing nonreciprocal light propagation devices @xcite .",
    "for instance , fan et al . achieved the experiment of nonreciprocal light propagation with the kerr and thermal nonlinearity in silicon microring resonators @xcite .",
    "based on a nonlinearity of an optomechanical system , some schemes of nonreciprocal behavior have also been reported @xcite .",
    "the above schemes , however , rely heavily on the strong nonlinearity , which is not easy to obtain , especially for few - photon situations .",
    "recently , some works show that the nonlinearity in the coupled resonators can be greatly enhanced by the introducing optical gain in one resonator of the -symmetric system @xcite . and",
    "an immense attention has been attracted to -symmetric system which has an interesting feature that non - hermitian hamiltonian can still have an entirely real spectrum with respect to the -symmetry @xcite .",
    "in addition , two coupled resonators can be processed as a -systemic system @xcite .",
    "more recently , a few of schemes of nonreciprocal light propagation have been proposed with -systemic coupled resonators system @xcite . for example , based on the inherent nonlinearity ( i.e. , gain - induced nonlinearity ) of the -systemic system , successful experiment has been carried out for nonreciprocal light propagation with two coupled whispering - gallery - mode ( wgm ) microresonators @xcite . note that through mechanical kerr nonlinearity , a theory scheme is also proposed for nonreciprocal phonon propagation with coupled mechanical resonators @xcite .",
    "the weak mechanical kerr nonlinearity is greatly improved by the gain in one mechanical resonator of the -symmetry and results in the non - lossy and high isolation ratio nonreciprocal phonon propagation .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the optical nonlinearity induced by a single quantum emitter coupled to a microcavity beyond weak - excitation approximation . based on the optical nonlinearity ,",
    "an alternative scheme is proposed for nonreciprocal light propagation in a system of two coupled cavities and a single quantum emitter coupled to one of the cavities .",
    "the scheme reported here has some important features .",
    "( i ) the optical nonlinearity of the hybrid system is greatly enhanced by the cavity gain .",
    "and the giant nonlinearity leads to the non - lossy nonreciprocal light propagation with extremely high isolation ratio .",
    "( ii ) nonreciprocal light propagation means allowing transport of light in one direction but not the opposite direction @xcite .",
    "however , through adjusting proper parameters , to switch between the blocking and allowing directions is allowed for the present scheme . for different nonreciprocal light propagation cases ,",
    "we can all obtain the non - lossy transmission with high isolation ratio in allowing directions .",
    "in addition , it is achievable to switch between unidirectional and bidirectional transport regime .",
    "( iii ) optical bistability or even optical multistability behavior is often induced by optical nonlinearity , and it will lead to unstable output . when the disturbance and perturbation of the system parameters are strong enough , the output field intensity will switch between the different metastable values of the optical bistability .",
    "obviously , it is harmful for the nonreciprocal light propagation .",
    "however , via choosing proper parameters range , we can avoid the interference of unstable output and obtain certain output intensity even for the strong disturbance of parameters .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii , the physical model considered and the corresponding hamiltonian of the system is introduced . by applying the heisenberg - langevin formalism ,",
    "we can obtain the evolution equations of the system . in sec.iii",
    ", we investigate carefully the evolution equations and get the numerical steady solution .",
    "then , we explore the spectra of the optical output fields and analyze the influence of parameters on nonreciprocal light propagation .",

    "<S> we propose an alternative scheme for nonreciprocal light propagation in two coupled cavities system , in which a two - level quantum emitter is coupled to one of the optical microcavities . </S>",
    "<S> for the case of parity - time ( ) symmetric system ( i.e. , active - passive coupled cavities system ) , the cavity gain can significantly enhance the optical nonlinearity induced by the interaction between a quantum emitter and cavity field beyond weak - excitation approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the giant optical nonlinearity results in the non - lossy nonreciprocal light propagation with high isolation ratio in proper parameters range . in addition , our calculations show that nonreciprocal light propagation will not be affected by the unstable output field intensity caused by optical bistability and we can even switch directions of nonreciprocal light propagation by appropriately adjusting the system parameters . </S>"
