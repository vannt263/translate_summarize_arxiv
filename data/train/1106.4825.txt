    "fits to the continuum @xmath80-data were used to calculate the continuum fluxes ( reported in table  [ tab.lines ] ) and source sizes . in the high angular resolution observations",
    "the emission was found to be slightly spatially resolved , with source sizes of approximately @xmath81 , in agreement with high resolution observations of the @xmath82 continuum @xcite , and co @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "integrated spectra of the four @xmath2 lines are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.spectra ] and parameters of the detected lines are presented in table  [ tab.lines ] .",
    "the most sensitive detection is that of the @xmath79 line , which displays a symmetric line profile with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath84 , excellently matching the fwhm values of @xmath85 of the co lines @xcite .",
    "recently , a low spectral resolution @xmath82 spectrum of @xmath86 obtained with z - spec has been released by @xcite . in the z - spec spectrum ,",
    "the @xmath87 line is the only @xmath2 line detected at the @xmath88 level , but our flux meaurement for this line is a factor 2 lower .",
    "this discrepancy is similar to that between the co line fluxes measured by z - spec and by the iram @xmath89 telescope , several of which have been independently confirmed by the iram plateau de bure interferometer @xcite .",
    "a similar discrepancy is found between our flux measurement of the @xmath90 line and that by @xcite , although the latter had a significance of only @xmath91 .",
    "the continuum flux densities match very well between the two data sets .",
    "finally , we note that the serendipitous detection of another @xmath2 line , the @xmath92 line , using the iram plateau de bure interferometer , was recently reported by @xcite .",
    "the distribution of the detected line flux as a function of the energy of the upper level of the transition is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.emission ] .",
    "the flux distribution shows considerable emission out to the @xmath90 line , implying that for purely collisional excitation the kinetic temperature must be of the order of at least @xmath94 .",
    "critical densities are approximately @xmath95 for the lowest lines ( @xmath13 and @xmath79 ) and higher than @xmath95 for the higher lines . therefore , any purely collisionally excited model that can account for the observed @xmath87 and @xmath90 fluxes would produce much stronger emission in the lower lines , including the @xmath24 level , for which a sensitive upper limit exists @xcite .",
    "we therefore rule out purely collisional excitation and consider in addition radiative excitation by an intense far - infrared ( far - ir ) radiation field from warm dust , with a temperature @xmath96 , as derived from the continuum spectral energy distribution @xcite .",
    "we model these coupled processes using a radiative transfer code @xcite which computes the statistical equilibrium populations of all relevant @xmath2 levels in the ground and first vibrationally excited state .",
    "line radiation is transfered in a non - local and three - dimensional manner through a multi - zone escape probability calculation .",
    "the model consists of dense clumps within a spherical region with a radius of @xmath97 . due to the high critical densities of the @xmath2 lines , only the clumps contribute to the @xmath2 emission , and we have run a model grid where we varied gas temperatures over the range @xmath98 , and @xmath2 column densities over @xmath99 .",
    "clump densities were varied only over the range @xmath100 , since higher densities ( @xmath101 ) would produce low rotational lines ( @xmath79 and @xmath13 ) much stronger than @xmath87 , contrary to what is observed .",
    "the @xmath2 ortho - to - para ratio was obtained from thermal equilibrium @xcite and found to be very close to the statistical equilibrium value of 3 .",
    "we fixed the gas - to - dust mass ratio at 100 , and the local turbulent velocity dispersion at @xmath102 , with a total velocity difference ( gradient times length ) across the model region of @xmath103 .",
    "in our best fit model , the clumps have a density of hydrogen nuclei @xmath104 , a gas temperature @xmath105 , and the average density of hydrogen nuclei over the @xmath97 radius model region is @xmath106 , yielding a @xmath5 continuum optical depth @xmath107 .",
    "the line fluxes predicted by the best fit model are listed in table  [ tab.lines ] and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.emission ] .",
    "the lowest lines ( up to @xmath79 ) are excited mostly by collisions .",
    "the clump density and temperature derived in our model are determined by these lines , and the required density is somewhat higher than that derived from the co lines @xcite , which is not surprising given the higher critical densities of the @xmath2 lines .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath108 and @xmath109 levels are populated exclusively by the absorption of far - ir photons . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.levels ] , the pumping occurs at @xmath110 and @xmath111 rest frame wavelengths .",
    "the intensity of the radiatively excited lines provides a measure of the intensity of the local far - ir radiation field and therefore of the optical depth in the spectral region of the pumping wavelengths , and this determines the @xmath5 optical depth in our model .",
    "the relative strengths of the @xmath90 and @xmath87 lines in principle provides information on the colour temperature of the far - ir radiation field , but for @xmath112 the pumping wavelengths are on the rayleigh - jeans tail of the warm dust continuum , making the line ratio insensitive to the dust temperature .",
    "since only collisionally excited lines contribute to the cooling ( i.e. , removal of kinetic energy ) of warm molecular gas , we find that cooling by the @xmath2 lines is unimportant compared to the cooling by co rotational lines , in contrast to the conclusion by @xcite and to earlier theoretical suggestions @xcite .",
    "we note that radiative excitation has also been suggested to drive the intensity of hcn lines in @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the upper levels of the [ @xmath113 @xmath114 line and the [ @xmath115 @xmath116 line are also affected by radiative pumping , as shown by rest frame uv absorption line measurements by @xcite , who conclude that the absorbing clouds must be located closer to the extended ( @xmath117 ) source of far - ir radiation than to the uv source .    in our best fit model ,",
    "the @xmath90 line is only moderately optically thick ( optical depth approximately 1.7 ) , and is thus sensitive to the total column density of warm ( @xmath118 ) water vapor in our model region ( unlike the other lines , which have line center optical depths from 30 to 300 ) .",
    "we find a total ( beam - averaged ) warm @xmath2 column density of @xmath119 , i.e. , a warm @xmath2/@xmath120 adundance of approximately @xmath121 , consistent with uv or x - ray irradiated chemical models @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 line ratios observed in @xmath77 are very different from those observed in prominent star forming regions in the milky way .",
    "water lines from uv irradiated gas ( photon - dominated regions or pdrs ) in the milky way show thermal level populations @xcite , dominated by low - lying lines .",
    "these lines are much fainter than co lines in the same frequency range .",
    "the best case in point is the prominent orion bar pdr where only a few low lying @xmath2 lines are detected @xcite , and the @xmath79/@xmath24 luminosity ratio is 0.6 ; in contrast , in @xmath77 , this ratio is @xmath122 .",
    "furthermore , in @xmath77 , the @xmath2 lines have luminosities comparable to co lines in the same frequency range , while they are two orders of magnitude fainter in the orion bar ( e.g. , the @xmath2  @xmath79  /  co(@xmath123 ) line luminosity ratio is 0.6 in @xmath77 , while it is 0.026 in the orion bar ) . the only object with properties comparable to @xmath77 is the nearby ulirg / qso @xmath124 @xcite , where high @xmath2 lines were also found to be radiatively excited @xcite , and the two objects show very similar @xmath87/@xmath13 luminosity ratios .    the fact that in the presence of an intense far - ir radiation field the most luminous @xmath2 emission is radiatively excited follows directly from the large einstein @xmath8-values of the @xmath2 rotational lines , which result in high critical densities as well as a strong coupling to the local far - ir radiation field .",
    "a key result of our analysis is therefore the presence of a sufficiently intense local far - ir radiation field , which requires the emitting clumps to be located in an obscured environment , with @xmath125 .",
    "the essential difference with the @xmath2 excitation in the orion bar pdr ( aside from less important differences in temperature and density ) is the fact that the latter has a low @xmath5 optical depth , while in @xmath77 @xmath126 over the entire region sampled .",
    "the minimum size of the this region follows from the blackbody limit , which is calculated by assigning the entire @xmath127 ( corrected for gravitational amplification ) to a blackbody with @xmath128 .",
    "the resulting radius is @xmath129 for a spherical model or a factor @xmath130 larger for a disk - like configuration , as preferred by @xcite .",
    "the most recent lensing model , which accurately reproduces the positions and luminosities of the gravitationally lensed images of the qso nucleus , assigns the co(1@xmath1310 ) emission to a disk of radius of @xmath132 , at an inclination of less than @xmath133  from face - on @xcite . because of the excellent match of the @xmath2 and co line widths , it is likely that the region of @xmath2 emission , with @xmath96 and @xmath134 , has the same radius as the co emission region .",
    "the co rotational line ladder of @xmath77 shows even higher excitation than that of @xmath124 and therefore most likely reveals the presence of an xdr @xcite .",
    "since high @xmath2 abundances can be generated in both pdrs and xdrs @xcite , our data do not distinguish directly between these models .",
    "however , while x - rays easily traverse and heat large column densities of gas , they are inefficient at heating the dust , and dust temperatures higher than @xmath135 are hard to achieve over extended regions @xcite .",
    "the high dust temperature of @xmath136 over a @xmath137 radius region is more easily achieved in pdrs , generated by widespread star formation in clumps of dense gas throughout the circumnuclear gas disk .",
    "regions of several @xmath97 radius , with high @xmath5 optical depths , are locally found only in the central regions of ulirgs @xcite .",
    "the fact that in this study we find such a region in a qso , provides support for the scenario where ulirgs form the birthplaces of qsos @xcite .",
    "if our suggestion that the extended warm dust continuum is generated by circumnuclear star formation in @xmath77 is correct , this star formation is taking place in the presence of the strong and penetrative x - ray radiation field generated by the agn @xcite .",
    "as shown by @xcite , in this situation fragmentation is inhibited and a top - heavy stellar initial mass function is expected to result .",
    "it is possible that this effect accounts for the extraordinary far - ir luminosity @xmath127 ( corrected for gravitational amplification ) of @xmath77 .",
    "we note also that in the clumps in our model , both turbulent pressure @xmath138 ( where @xmath139 is the mass density of the gas clump and @xmath140 its turbulent velocity dispersion ) and radiation pressure @xmath141 ( where @xmath39 is the stefan - boltzmann constant and @xmath142 the speed of light ) exceed the thermal pressure @xmath143 by a large factor . inserting numbers from our best - fit model , we find that @xmath144 , while @xmath145 . radiation pressure therefore plays an important role in the dynamics of the circumnuclear gas cloud .",
    "if the clumps are indeed forming stars , as we are suggesting , the star formation process is then close to eddington - limited , in agreement with the model developed by @xcite for starburst regions surrounding a supermassive black hole .",
    "our study demonstrates how radiatively exited @xmath2 lines can be used to reveal the presence of extended infrared - opaque regions in galactic nuclei ( even without spatially resolving these regions ) .",
    "furthermore , we can derive local conditions in the infrared - opaque nuclear gas disk , which in the present case indicates close to eddington - limited star formation . while for local galaxies observations from space will remain necessary to observe the @xmath2 lines , the atacama large millimeter array will make this diagnostic readily available in galaxies with sufficient redshift , without the aid of gravitational lensing .",
