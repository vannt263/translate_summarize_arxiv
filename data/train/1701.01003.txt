    "the possible roles of quantum stress tensor fluctuations of a conformal matter field in inflationary cosmology were explored in refs .",
    "the basic hypothesis is that vacuum fluctuations of the energy density , or other stress tensor components , during inflation can lead to additional density or tensor perturbations beyond those due to the nearly gaussian fluctuations of the inflaton or graviton fields , which are the dominant source of perturbations in inflationary models .",
    "one of the usual features of inflationary models is the relative lack of dependence upon initial conditions .",
    "this arises because adequate inflationary expansion will redshift and dilute pre - existing matter , so a generic quantum state tends eventually to become indistinguishable from the bunch - davies vacuum of de sitter spacetime .",
    "however , the effects of quantum stress tensor fluctuations exhibit a strong dependence upon the initial conditions , and tend to grow with increasing duration of the inflationary expansion .",
    "in particular , the contributions to the density perturbations  @xcite and the tensor perturbations  @xcite are proportional to the scale factor change between an initial time and the end of inflation . at first sight , this violates weinberg s theorem  @xcite , which states that loop corrections can grow at most logarithmically in the scale factor during inflation .",
    "however , a more careful analysis shows that there is in fact no contradiction .",
    "one picks a perturbation with a given wavelength at the present time , and then traces it back to the initial time , when it becomes a perturbations with very short wavelength , which is inversely proportional to the scale factor change during inflation .",
    "however , the magnitude of stress tensor fluctuation effects increases as the relevant length scale decreases .",
    "the stress tensor fluctuation contribution can typically be written as a double integral over conformal time of the stress tensor correlation function .",
    "thus , increasing the duration of inflation leads to increasing values of the integrals of the stress tensor correlation function , because shorter proper wavelength modes are giving the dominant contribution , not because anything is accumulating as inflation progresses .",
    "another way of saying this , is that the the dominant contribution is always large , but is not growing in time .",
    "thus , it is misleading to refer to these contributions as  secular terms \" .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to perform a more careful analysis of the tensor perturbations due to stress tensor fluctuations which was begun in ref .",
    "the analysis in this reference was criticized by frb , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who noted correctly that an important contribution was omitted .",
    "in addition to the passive fluctuations of the graviton field due to stress tensor fluctuations , there is also a correction to the active fluctuations of the graviton field which is of the same order .",
    "frb , _ et al .",
    "_ propose a method for calculating the combined effect of both contributions which leads to a result which does not depend upon the duration of inflation , and infer that the two contributions have cancelled one another . in the present paper , we propose a rather different approach in which each contribution is computed separately , with initial conditions imposed by a switching function .",
    "this function describes the switch - on of the coupling of the matter stress tensor with the graviton field .",
    "we do not find cancellation between the passive and active fluctuation effects , but rather a nonzero one loop correction to the graviton power spectrum .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : section  [ sec : switch ] will discuss averaging of quantum fields with switching functions of time .",
    "section  [ s : free - gravitons ] will review free gravitons in an expanding universe , and sec .",
    "[ sec : matter ] will introduce some formalism for describing the effects of a quantum matter field .",
    "section  [ s : p22 ] will compute the correction to the graviton power spectrum coming from matter stress tensor fluctuations .",
    "these are the passive fluctuations of gravity driven by the fluctuating stress tensor .",
    "the part of the power spectrum coming from loop corrections to the graviton field , the modified active fluctuations , is treated in sec .",
    "[ s : p13 ] .",
    "the combination of both effects is discussed in sec .  [",
    "s : combined ] , and shown in our approach to be nonzero , and dependent upon the details of the switching function . in general , it has the effect of slightly reducing the overall power spectrum .",
    "some numerical estimates , and the possibility of observing this reduction will be discussed .",

    "in interacting quantum field theory calculations of scattering amplitudes , it is common to appeal to adiabatic switching of the coupling constants of the theory .",
    "this allows the theory to be non - interacting in the past and in the future , and allows a well defined @xmath0-matrix to connect the asymptotic states . here",
    "the term  adiabatic \" means that the scale of any time dependence in the coupling constants is long compared to any other time scales in the theory .",
    "the details of the time dependence usually need not be specified .",
    "there is a different type of switching required in treatments of the fluctuations of quantum stress tensor operator .",
    "the fluctuations of a local field operator are not defined , as the moments of such an operator will diverge if they are not zero . however , the time average or spacetime average of a local stress tensor operator does have finite moments , and can have a meaningful probability distribution in a given quantum state , as discussed in refs .  @xcite . here",
    "we briefly review the basic ideas , and describe the role which they will play in the present paper .",
    "let @xmath1 be a stress tensor operator component , such as energy density , which has been renormalized to have finite expectation values . in minkowski spacetime",
    ", this means a normal ordered operator . in curved spacetime , it means an operator which has been regulated and renormalized , as will be reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec : matter ] . although the local operator @xmath1 may have finite expectation values in physically realizable states , its fluctuations are not well defined because its higher moments , @xmath2 for @xmath3 typically diverge .",
    "the physical implication of this divergence is that the fluctuations of a local operator , such as energy density at a single spacetime point are infinite and hence not meaningful . however , if we average @xmath1 over a finite time or spacetime interval , then the fluctuations do become well defined .",
    "let @xmath4 be the average of @xmath1 at a given spatial point with respect to a smooth ( @xmath5 ) switching function @xmath6 , which satisfies @xmath7 for @xmath8 .",
    "now the moments of @xmath9 become finite , and a meaningful probability distribution may be defined  @xcite .",
    "the effect of the time averaging described by @xmath6 , is to suppress the contribution of high frequency modes to the moments .",
    "averaging in space alone at a single time is not adequate to produce this suppression , but averaging in both space and time has qualitatively the same effect as does time averaging alone .",
    "one may view the averaging of a stress tensor operator as describing its measurement process in a given physical situation , where the details of the situation define the switching function .",
    "an example of this was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which treats the effects of vacuum radiation pressure fluctuations on quantum particles near a potential barrier . here",
    "the duration of the switching is taken to be determined by the time which the particle spends in the vicinity of the barrier , and the form of the switching function to be defined by the shapes of both the barrier and the wavepacket of the particle .",
    "similar ideas were applied in ref .",
    "@xcite to the fluctuations of the quantized electric field .",
    "most of the above discussion of averaged stress tensor operators , which are quadratic in the quantum field operator , applies to linear quantum fields , such as the electric field .",
    "the primary difference is that the stress tensor probability distribution is sensitive to the functional form of the switching function , whereas the probability distribution for the electric field is always a gaussian , and depends primarily upon the width of the switching interval . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that if this switching time is taken to be the time which a charged particle spends in the vicinity of a potential barrier , then the resulting electric field fluctuations produce a change in the scattering amplitude which approximately agrees with that given by the one loop vertex correction to the scattering amplitude .",
    "this agreement supports the hypothesis that the details of a given physical situation can define the appropriate switching function .    in the present paper",
    ", we are concerned with the coupling of a quantized matter field stress tensor with gravity , specifically with the tensor perturbation of an expanding universe .",
    "this coupling is mediated by newton s constant , which will be assumed to be time - dependent in the early universe .",
    "this time - dependence produces both of the types of switching discussed above , the switching of the coupling constant of the theory , and time - averaging of the quantum stress tensor operator .",
    "the functional form of the switching and its physical origin are not specified , but assumed to arise from some processes in the early universe which are not yet understood .",
    "several specific choices will be explored in sec .",

    "however , if @xmath0 becomes too large , then the perturbation in question will have a proper wavelength below the planck length at the beginning of inflation .",
    "this initial wavelength can be expressed as @xmath447 the status of transplanckian frequency modes is controversial .",
    "they play a crucial role in the hawking s derivation of black hole particle creation  @xcite , but it seems questionable that perturbation theory holds for such modes .",
    "if we impose the requirement of no transplanckian modes , so @xmath448 , then we find @xmath449 and @xmath450 in this case , the decrease in the graviton power due to the effects calculated in this paper will be fairly small .",
    "in this paper , we have examined @xmath451 quantum corrections to the tensor power spectrum in inflationary models .",
    "the corrections with which we are concerned come from the coupling of gravitons to a conformal matter field , which we take to be the electromagnetic field .",
    "there are two distinct corrections to the power spectrum .",
    "one is @xmath173 , which arises from vacuum stress tensor fluctuations of the matter field .",
    "one can view this contribution as being the gravity waves radiated by the fluctuating stress tensor , or equivalently , the passive fluctuations of the gravitational field driven by the quantum stress tensor fluctuations .",
    "the other contribution is @xmath213 , which arises from a modification of the graviton field in de sitter spacetime , produced by its coupling to the renormalized expectation value of the matter field .",
    "this can be viewed as a correction to the active fluctuations of the quantized tensor perturbations of de sitter spacetime .",
    "a key feature of our approach is the use of the switching function , @xmath147 .",
    "this function may be viewed as describing a switching of the coupling of gravity with the matter field through a time - dependent newton s constant .",
    "it may also be viewed as a form of time averaging of the quantum stress tensor operator , which is essential for a meaningful treatment of quantum stress tensor fluctuations .",
    "the viewpoint adopted in this paper is that this averaging is more than a formal device , and represents actual physical processes associated with the measurement of the stress tensor of a quantized field . in the case of cosmology",
    ", we postulate that it describes some physical effects in the early universe .",
    "these effects are presently not well understood and are associated with a choice of initial conditions .",
    "we find that combined correction , @xmath452 , depends upon the choice of switching function .",
    "this seems to be required in our approach , because @xmath173 and @xmath213 scale with different powers of @xmath147 , as discussed at the end of sec .",
    "[ s : p13 ] .",
    "for all of our explicit choices of @xmath147 , we find @xmath371 , so the effect is a slight reduction in the tensor power spectrum , compared to the result obtained from consideration of free gravitons in de sitter spacetime .",
    "we also find that the magnitude of @xmath370 is proportional to the scale factor change during inflation .",
    "this is not due to growth as inflation progresses , but rather is due to decreasing proper wavelength of the perturbation at the initial time , as this time is made earlier .",
    "recall that we consider a perturbation with given proper wavelength today , so its proper wavelength at the beginning of inflation depends upon the amount of subsequent expansion .",
    "furthermore , the dominant contributions to @xmath173 and @xmath213 come from the beginning of inflation , or the initial switch - on interval , as evidenced by their growth with increasing @xmath151 , the effective switch - on time in conformal time .",
    "the essential physical reason for this behavior is that quantum stress tensor fluctuations are greater on smaller length scales .",
    "this introduces a breaking of de sitter symmetry by the initial conditions .",
    "the situation described here is quite different from the usual behavior in inflationary models , where classical perturbations of a given proper wavelength at the beginning of inflation are more effectively redshifted away by an increasing duration of inflation .",
    "our conclusions clearly differ from those of frb , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who find no significant dependence of @xmath370 upon the initial conditions .",
    "this seems to be due to physical inequivalence of our approaches .",
    "frb , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite use a rather formal prescription , which they call an  @xmath453 prescription \" to select a de sitter invariant state for the coupled conformal field - gravity system .",
    "our view is that this prescription is not physically well motivated . in light of the discussion in the previous paragraph",
    ", we argue that one should expect to find the behavior found in this present paper , as well in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the quantum corrections to the power spectrum depend upon initial conditions .",
    "our main result is a small decrease in the power spectrum of tensor perturbations which has the linear dependence upon @xmath57 given in eq .  .",
    "note that this has a distinct functional form from the usual spectral tilt due to weak dependence of @xmath51 upon @xmath57 .",
    "the latter effect is due to the effective value of @xmath51 varying as different length scales leave the horizon during inflation , which will also be present in our model .",
    "this is usually modeled by a factor of the form @xmath454 , where @xmath455 is the tensor spectral index .",
    "the estimates given in sec .",
