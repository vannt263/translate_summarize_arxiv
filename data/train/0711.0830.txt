    "we study this question in the simplest case of @xmath2-operators with irreducible characteristic polynomial over rational numbers having one real and two complex roots .",
    "in particularly we obtain that perfect hessenberg matrices distinguish conjugacy classes asymptotically ( theorem  [ maintheorem ] below ) .    according to gauss reduction theory any conjugacy class of @xmath3-operators with two real eigenvalues defines a special periodic ordinary continued fraction whose period up to cyclic permutations is a complete invariant of the conjugacy class ( see in subsection  [ 2dcase ] )",
    ". moreover gauss reduction algorithm applied to any operator of the conjugacy class gives a certain _ reduced _ operator .",
    "the number of reduced operators in a conjugacy class equals to the length of the period of the mentioned above ordinary continued fraction .",
    "we expand to the multidimensional case ( @xmath4 ) the idea to use continued fractions and their periods as a main tool to construct complete invariants .",
    "we put together old constrictions of klein s polyhedron ( introduced in @xcite , @xcite ) and voronoi s continued fraction ( described in @xcite ) and the ideas of j.  a.  buchmann ( see in  @xcite ) to obtain a general definition of geometric klein - voronoi multidimensional continued fraction . in our study of @xmath2 conjugacy classes we work with periods of klein - voronoi continued fractions .",
    "we use _ upper hessenberg matrices _ as a multidimensional analog of reduced operators .",
