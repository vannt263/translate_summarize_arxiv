    "however , for heavy mass region , the be / a increases with injection of large number of hyperons and form a more bound system than their normal counter parts , for example , inclusion of one lambda increases the binding of @xmath103o , the binding of @xmath104v increases up to the addition of 8 lambdas and the number of injected lambdas for superheavy hypernuclei , @xmath105120 , goes to 51 .",

    "it is evident from figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] , [ fig8 ] and table  [ tab4 ] that the injection of lambdas affects the df partially or completely and as a result the amount of df becomes very small or zero . in the same time",
    ", the magnitude of nucleon density decreases because of decreasing number of neutrons .",
    "for example , for @xmath123ar , the df is 36 and this amount becomes zero by injection of 2 or more lambdas to the core nucleus .",
    "this happens because of lambda particle resides at the centre of the nucleus and attracts the surrounding nucleon towards the centre and as a result central density becomes high and the hollow part of the centre is filled by partially or completely .",
    "this is one of the most important implication of hyperon to nuclei for removing the bubble nature of nuclei .",
    "the other prospects of density profile is to analyze the halo nature of nucleon and lambda .",

    "the halo nuclei has slowly decaying exponential tails extending beyond the size of the nucleus . to examine the halo nature of nucleon and @xmath0 hyperon",

    "[ fig9 ] . in general , the addition of excessive lambdas corresponding to nuclei exhibit the neutron and lambda halo nature .",
    "the reason is simple , the majority of lambda hyperons push out the nucleon towards periphery and formed nucleon halo .",
    "the successive addition of hyperons by replacing the neutrons provide the deep binding of neutrons due to the symmetry energy . because of successive addition of @xmath0 to the nuclei the @xmath0 separation energy reduces and weak binding of hyperon levels leads to the halo nature of hyperon as discussed in ref .",
    "the @xmath0 density is found to be maximum near the center from where it pushes the nucleons towards the low density regions both at the periphery and at the center . and due to this , the bubble structure is disappeared partially or completely and also @xmath0 and nucleon halo structure is seen .",
    "any kinds of change in a system is directly reflected from the single particle energy levels .",
    "to analyze the impact of hyperon on single particle energy levels , we plot the first and some higher filled neutron , proton and hyperon ( @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) levels as a function of substituted hyperons for superheavy region . in case of lambda hypernuclei , the first filled neutron level goes deeper and first proton level also feels the attraction . by decreasing the number of neutrons ( injection of hyperons )",
    "the impact of coulomb repulsion becomes higher and the upper proton level goes to unbound .",
    "the deep binding of neutron level is because of decresing in symmetry energy due to substitution of neutron by @xmath0 as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . for @xmath2 case , the attraction is less and coulomb repulsion becomes high enough because of positive charge of @xmath2 hyperon . on the other hand , due to @xmath3 hyperons",

    "the addition of lambda obviously increase the stability of the system but further addition of sigma hyperons leads to more stable system with increasing binding .",
    "the combinations of hyperons with nucleons for a particular system are suggested which will form the bound system with high strangeness and might be produced in heavy - ion reactions .",
    "the investigation on hypernuclei with high strangeness is quite welcome because these type of system might be produced in high - energy heavy ion reactions near the future .",
    "these types of study of hypernuclei with multiple strangeness will provide us a basic input for neutron as well as hyperon star studies , which are the body of current interest .",
    "one of the author ( mi ) would like to acknowledge the hospitality provided by institute of physics , bhubaneswar during the work .",
