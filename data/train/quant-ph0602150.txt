    "the concept of entanglement , as first introduced by schrdinger @xcite and discussed by einstein , podolsky , and rosen @xcite in 1935 , has historically been associated with systems of two or more quanta .",
    "its counterintuitive consequences found a mathematical formulation in the work of bell @xcite of 1965 : pairs of quanta entangled in discrete variables ( i.e. , bohm - like entangled systems @xcite ) may give rise to purely quantum nonlocal correlations .",
    "unfortunately , no loophole - free test of bell s inequality has been realized so far @xcite . besides their relevance in fundamental physics ,",
    "these phenomena have attracted much attention due to their usefulness in quantum information technology .",
    "extravagant but promising protocols such as quantum teleportation , quantum cryptography , and quantum computation have been proposed and experimentally verified ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .    in the early nineties ,",
    "increasing attention has been given to a new perspective of quantum entanglement .",
    "the concept of entanglement has indeed been extended to any system containing a fixed number ( @xmath0 ) of photons , provided at least one pair of spatiotemporal modes is involved .",
    "then , even for @xmath1 , one may talk of  single - photon n - mode entanglement \" , provided @xmath2 .",
    "the first steps in this direction were taken by tan , walls , and collet @xcite ( twc ) : when a single photon impinges on a beam - splitter whose outputs are described by the spatial modes @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the emerging single photon is described by the state @xmath5 is a single - photon fock state , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are complex amplitudes such that @xmath8 .",
    "in this perspective , a single photon , with its presence or absence from a given spatiotemporal mode , may represent a tool for entangling two ( or more ) well - separated field modes . in this case",
    ", an experimental test of nonlocality would consist in performing simultaneous measurements on the separate field modes `` sharing '' the single photon and check if their mutual correlations violate a bell s inequality .",
    "intensive studies and debates have been dedicated to the meaningfulness of extending both the concepts of entanglement and nonlocality to twc - type single - photon two - mode systems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . quite recently ,",
    "babichev , et al.@xcite and zavatta , et al.@xcite have experimentally characterized a source of two - mode spatially and temporally delocalized single photons , respectively , by employing time - domain homodyne tomography @xcite and reconstructing both density matrix and wigner function of the measured system . in this respect ,",
    "it is worth reminding that the density matrix or wigner function of a given system represents its most complete characterization and enables predicting the result of any possible measurement one may perform on the system @xcite .",
    "the results indicate the existence of strong correlations between the two spatial / temporal modes carrying a coherently delocalized single photon .",
    "whether or not such correlations are nonlocal can not be asserted ; for instance , the bell s inequality test performed in ref.@xcite is based upon dichotomization of quadrature data and heavily relies upon data - rejection .",
    "of particular interest , in this respect , is the experiment by hessmo et al .",
    "@xcite , who have implemented the theoretical proposals by tan et al .",
    "@xcite and by hardy @xcite , demonstrating the nonclassical character of the correlations characterizing two spatial modes sharing a single photon .",
    "similar to the two - photon case , also ",
    "entangled \" single - photon sources may find immediate application in quantum information technology : single - photon ebits have indeed been proven to enable linear optics quantum teleportation @xcite and play a central role in linear optics quantum computation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the time - bin entanglement of the kind of ref.@xcite ( see also @xcite ) has been proven suitable for long distance applications @xcite , where the insensitivity to both depolarization and polarization fluctuations becomes a strong requirement . in this paper , we wish to make one step further in the direction of understanding and proving single photon n - mode entanglement . to this end",
    ", we employ the single - photon source presented in ref.@xcite ( see sect.[sec : setup ] ) , perform two - mode homodyne tomography ( sect.[sec : exp_res ] ) and employ the reconstructed two - mode density matrix and wigner function to quantify the degree of entanglement ( sect .",
    "[ ssec : entangl ] ) and implement a novel kind of tomographic bell s inequality test ( sects . [",
    "sec : ineq_th ] and [ sec : bell ] ) .",
    "in particular , we evaluate the degree of entanglement characterizing our single - photon system by employing vidal and werner s reformulation @xcite of peres separability criterion @xcite .",
    "then , we employ the experimentally reconstructed two - mode wigner function to perform an innovative continuous variable bell s inequality test , based on the theoretical proposal by banaszek and wodkiewicz @xcite , which we briefly introduce in the next section .",
    "let us start by briefly reviewing the theoretical proposal of ref.@xcite : the strict connection between the displaced parity operator ( a dichotomic observable ) and the wigner function @xcite , suggests that the wigner function of any two - mode / two - particle system ( whether positive or negative ) may play the role of a nonlocal correlation function .",
    "bell s inequality can thus be recast in the form : @xmath9 is the value of the two - mode wigner function at the phase - space point ( @xmath10 ) defined by the quadratures @xmath11 and @xmath12 of the @xmath13-th mode / particle ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "this inequality , which we shall name banaszek - bell s inequality , applies both to two - particle and to two - mode entangled systems , including spatially / temporally delocalized single photons .",
    "interestingly , compared to all bell s inequalities theoretically proposed for continuous variables and based upon a - posteriori dichotomization of the measured field quadratures @xcite , banaszek - bell s inequality may achieve higher levels of violation .",
    "for instance , based on the predictions of quantum mechanics , the time - bin encoded single - photon state @xcite : @xmath15 denotes a well - defined temporal mode ( or time bin ) , is expected to maximally violate the inequality of eq .",
    "( [ ineq ] ) , giving @xmath16 for @xmath17 .    the experimental test of banaszek - bell s inequality , in the form written in eq .",

    "( [ state_eq ] ) , and to use the experimental data to tomographically reconstruct the two - mode wigner function entering the inequality of eq .",
    "( [ ineq ] ) .",
    "our ultra - fast time - domain homodyne detection scheme has the potential to achieve this goal @xcite .",
    "it is certainly true that , different from standard bell s inequality tests , our tomographic test imposes an indirect approach to bell s inequality : rather than directly employing the results of correlation measurements , our scheme requires the manipulation of the experimental quadrature data in order to reconstruct the wigner function entering eq .",
    "( [ ineq ] ) .",
    "note , however , that the reconstruction procedure is rather transparent , does not imply additional hypotheses on the state under study , and can only introduce noise , without _ hiding _ or _ enhancing _ any information contained in the data . then , finding a violation of eq .",
    "( [ ineq ] ) through a tomographic approach indicates that also direct measurements would lead to a violation .",
    "let us now consider the experimental setup : a mode - locked ti : sapphire laser emitting @xmath20 ps pulses at @xmath21 nm at a repetition rate of @xmath22 mhz , is frequency doubled in a lbo crystal ; the resulting train of phase - locked pulses impinges on a nonlinear bbo crystal , cut for degenerate non - collinear type - i spdc @xcite .",

    "our setup is characterized by a single - photon preparation efficiency @xmath23 , which depends on both the dark counts of the trigger detector and on the purity of the prepared single photon @xcite .",
    "the conditionally - prepared signal beam impinges on a 50 - 50 beam splitter ( bs ) where it is mixed with a strong local oscillator ( lo ) made of an attenuated version of the train of laser pulses .",

    "this has been made possible by the ultrafast operation of the homodyne detector recently developed in our laboratory  @xcite .",
    "the measured field quadratures have been employed to reconstruct the density matrix of the measured system by means of quantum tomography . in particular , we employ the pattern function method ( pf ) proposed by dariano , et al .  @xcite to directly retrieve the elements of the two - mode density matrix in the number - state base from the measured quadrature data : @xmath33 is obtained from the statistical average of the corresponding pattern functions @xmath34 over all homodyne data , which is : @xmath35 where @xmath36 are the quadratures measured at phases @xmath37 on the two consecutive time bins .",

    "the only constraint we impose is that the density matrix @xmath46 is a positive - definite hermitian matrix with unitary trace . in order to limit the number of free parameters in the minimization procedure",

    "in other words , the trace norm accounts for the negative eigenvalues of @xmath55 , and is thus directly related to the amount by which the partial transpose fails to be positive definite .",

    "in particular , we find that the vacuum component remains exactly the same when no interferometer is inserted in the idler channel and a single signal photon is perfectly localized within a given temporal mode .",
    "this indicates that the non - unitary efficiency @xmath49 represents our inability of producing and detecting a pure single - photon state , but , once such imperfect single photon is coherently delocalized between separate time - bins , the coherence is not further affected by losses .",

    "( [ rho_eq ] ) and fig .  [ fig_dens ] a ) ) . correcting for our non - unitary efficiencies is thus similar to making the standard fair - sampling assumption @xcite .",
    "based on this reasoning , we have chosen to reconstruct the density matrix of the measured system by correcting for the non - unitary efficiency ; this is expected to remove the vacuum component from the reconstructed density matrix , which is , to make the @xmath50 element almost equal to zero and rescale the other elements accordingly .",
    "we will implement such vacuum removal by employing two different strategies .",
    "banaszek - bell s inequality will thus be tested under the fair - sampling assumption or , more precisely , on the resulting `` vacuum - cleaned '' wigner function .    in the first case , we account for losses by making an inverse bernoulli transformation ( ibt ) of the reconstructed density matrix ; the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_dens]b ) .",
    "the basic idea is to model the non - perfect experimental efficiency by a beam splitter with transmissivity @xmath49 followed by an ideal detector : the measured system @xmath78 can be seen as the attenuated version of the system incident on such fictitious beam splitter . since the output state of the beam splitter is related to the input state by a bernoulli transformation , inversion of this transformation gives the state @xmath48 of the  incident \" system , before its mixing with vacuum ( i.e. , before losses affect it ) @xcite . in the second case",

    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_dens]c ) @xcite .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_viola ] , the wigner functions reconstructed from both the `` vacuum - cleaned '' density matrices give rise to a good agreement between the experimental data and the theoretical prediction of eq .",

    "the horizontal line indicates the lower bound imposed by banaszek - bell s inequality.,width=321 ]    despite the observed violation of banaszek - bell s inequality , we can not claim nonlocality for our single - photon time - encoded two - mode system .",
    "in fact , even in the case of unitary efficiency , our measuring scheme would still not satisfy the locality hypothesis : quadrature measurements on the two modes are actually done in sequence , so that a physical signal can in principle be exchanged between the two co - propagating temporal modes while homodyne measurements are performed on them .",
    "the existence of this possibility makes our bell s inequality test subject to the so - called locality loophole , which automatically rules out the possibility of claiming non - locality @xcite .",
    "however , this loophole simply derives from our choice of a temporal delocalization of the single photon and can in principle be eliminated in future experiments by introducing a fast switch which converts the two co - propagating temporal modes into two spatially - separated modes ; simultaneous measurements could then be performed on each of the two time - bins by two distant homodyne detectors .",
    "our results demonstrate the feasibility of the tomographic approach to bell s inequality and may open the way toward new experiments for testing the foundations of quantum mechanics .",
    "most important , our experiment sheds some light on the hotly debated concepts of single - photon two - mode entanglement and nonlocality @xcite .",
    "on the one hand , single - photon two - mode states of the kind described by eq.([state_eq ] ) are known to give rise to interference upon recombination of the two spatiotemporal modes through an interferometric scheme ; in this perspective , the twc entanglement between two spatial modes sharing a single photon can be visualized in terms of wave - particle duality : the interference upon recombination supports the wave picture of light , while the lack of coincidence counts at the two exits of the entrance beam - splitter brings to evidence its particle nature . on the other hand , we have shown that our single - photon two - mode system manifests entanglement , both in terms of peres - like separability criteria and , under additional hypotheses , in the more restrictive terms of banaszek s version of bell s inequality .",
    "the description of single - photon coherence effects in terms of single - photon n - mode entanglement is thus certainly possible and meaningful , and could contribute to make the counterintuitive wave - particle duality more intuitively accessible . in summary , we have evaluated the degree of entanglement of a single photon coherently delocalized between two distinct temporal modes and have implemented an innovative test of bell s inequality based on quantum homodyne tomography .",
    "we have shown that , within some auxiliary assumptions , the correlations between two well - separated temporal modes sharing a single photon violate banaszek - bell s inequality . in this respect , it is worth emphasizing that none of our additional hypotheses is , in principle , indispensable .",
    "in fact , different from bell s tests relying on post - selection , an improvement in the experimental efficiencies would allow us to avoid the fair sampling assumption ; indeed , a setup with an almost perfect single - photon preparation efficiency is currently possible .",
    "furthermore a slight modification of the experimental setup would easily eliminate the locality loophole .",
    "thanks to the high efficiencies achievable by homodyne detectors , out tomographic approach may represent the first step in the direction of a loophole - free test of bell s inequality . in this perspective , also the debated issue concerning the possibility of extending both concepts of entanglement and non - locality to a coherently delocalized single photon , finds here an interesting preliminary answer .",
    "this work has been performed in the frame of the `` spettroscopia laser e ottica quantistica '' project of the physics department of the university of florence and partially supported by ente cassa di risparmio di firenze and miur , under the prin initiative and firb contract rbne01kz94 .",
    "the most common auxiliary assumptions involved in the experimental tests of bell s inequality are : 1 ) the fair - sampling assumption , namely , the hypothesis that undetected events coming from low detection efficiencies would follow the same statistics of the measured data set , 2 ) post - selection , which consists in disregarding part of the state of a physical system by not measuring it ( i.e. , imposing a selective , or state - dependent , loss mechanism ) 3 ) the locality - loophole , which arises whenever a physical signal could be exchanged between the two systems under investigation during the measurement process .",
