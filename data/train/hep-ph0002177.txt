    "a major theoretical challenge posed by the solutions to the atmospheric and solar neutrino anomalies @xcite is that the atmospheric neutrino data require a large @xmath1 mixing , whereas the corresponding quark mixing between the second and the third generation is very small .",
    "this is not easy to understand in the context of quark - lepton unified theories . while there are suggestions to understand a large mixing in the context of various kinds of unified theories @xcite including the so(10 ) , where there is a natural quark - lepton unification@xcite , no convincing natural model has yet emerged .",
    "it is therefore necessary to explore alternative possibilities .",
    "one way to proceed is not to concentrate on a particular model , but to look for the features that a model should have in order to be able to predict the observed large mixing naturally .    in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", we pointed out that for two majorana neutrinos with the same cp parity that are nearly degenerate in mass , a small neutrino mixing at the high scale can be magnified by the radiative corrections through the renormalization group running down to the weak scale . in such theories , there would be no need to put special constraints on the mixings in the theory at the high ( _ e.g. _ seesaw ) scale and indeed the quark and lepton mixings can be very similar ( as , say , would be predicted by the simple seesaw models ) .",
    "it is the goal of this paper to show that such a mixing pattern , which involves only small mixings at the high scale ( @xmath2 ) , can explain the neutrino anomalies at the low scale as long as the conditions outlined in @xcite are satisfied .",
    "it is then possible to explain the solar neutrino problem through the small angle msw solution and the atmospheric neutrino problem through the large mixing angle , which gets generated through the radiative magnification .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ mag ] , we introduce the @xmath3 parametrization for the mixing angles , and taking @xmath4 at the high scale , show that the radiative corrections can magnify @xmath5 while keeping @xmath6 and @xmath7 unaffected . in sec .",
    "[ fit ] , we show that the condition @xmath4 is consistent with the current data from the solar , atmospheric and reactor experiments . in sec .",
    "[ 4nuscheme ] , we consider the possible 4@xmath0 mixing schemes that can explain the lsnd results in addition , and identify the scenarios for which radiative magnification can provide a natural explanation through the quark - lepton unified theories . sec .",
    "[ concl ] concludes .",
    "in the absence of @xmath8 violation in the lepton sector , the mixing matrix @xmath9 at the scale @xmath2 can be parametrized as u _  =   u_12 ( ) u_13 ( ) u_23 ( )  , [ split - u ] where all the three rotation angles lie between 0 and @xmath10 .",
    "note that the order of multiplication of the rotation matrices is different from the conventional one @xcite , so the angles @xmath11 involved here should not be mistaken for the angles @xmath12 used conventionally .",
    "nevertheless , ( [ split - u ] ) is a perfectly valid way of parametrizing the mixing matrix , and is useful for addressing a certain class of problems ( _ e.g. _ see @xcite ) .    at the low scale @xmath13 , the mixing matrix @xmath14 can be written in general as u _",

    "since @xmath33 , for the condition ( [ cond ] ) to be satisfied , @xmath34 and @xmath35 need to have the same cp parity .",

    "thus , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the mixing angles at the low scale .    as we shall see in sec .",

    "also , if the @xmath8 parity of the neutrino @xmath43 is opposite to that of @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( which is required to ascertain the stability of a possible small nonzero @xmath7 ) , a small @xmath6 at the high scale will stay small even when the radiative corrections due to @xmath13 are taken into account .",
    "thus , the stability of a small @xmath6 is guaranteed , and the small angle msw scenario can be generated naturally within the unification models .",

    "[ param - space ] .",
    "our scheme thus supports the sma solution : if we start with a small @xmath6 at the high scale ( which is natural in the quark - lepton unified theories ) , it does not change much through radiative corrections ( as we have shown in sec .  [ mag ] ) , and a small @xmath41 is retained at the low scale .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the mechanism of radiative magnification does not need any fine - tuning , but is at work in a range of parameter space for any given model . as an example of the radiative magnification of @xmath5 ,",
    "let us consider mssm , where the parameter @xmath62 determines the magnitude of the radiative corrections .",
    "the value of @xmath62 required to obtain any given magnified value of @xmath46 is shown in fig .",

    "this indicates the phenomenologically interesting range of @xmath62 for radiative magnification .",
    "the features of radiative magnification noted here can be used in order to identify the 4@xmath0 mixing scenarios in which the large atmospheric mixing can be naturally generated . taking into account that the recent atmospheric neutrino results disfavor ( @xmath63 ) oscillations @xcite , the 4@xmath0 solution for all the anomalies ( atmospheric @xcite , solar @xcite and lsnd @xcite ) is essentially of the form @xcite  [ _ - _ ]  , [ 4nu ] where the @xmath64 $ ] pair ( @xmath65 ) and the @xmath66 $ ] pair ( @xmath67 ) are separated by @xmath68 .",
    "the solar neutrino puzzle is explained by the @xmath69 oscillations and the atmospheric data are explained by the @xmath70 oscillations .",
    "a small @xmath71 mixing then explains the lsnd @xcite observations .    in ( [ 4nu ] )",
    ", the neutrinos can be considered to be written in the increasing order of masses . with the current data ,",
    "it is still possible to change the order of neutrinos within a bracket , or the order of the brackets themselves .",
    "the order within a bracket will not have any influence on our conclusions , so we have only the two independent cases : ( a ) @xmath72 and ( b ) @xmath73 , where @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) denotes the average mass of the @xmath76 $ ] ( @xmath77 $ ] ) pair . in the case ( a ) , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are necessarily quasi - degenerate : taking @xmath80 ev@xmath81 and @xmath82 ev@xmath81 , we get the degree of degeneracy ( @xmath83 ) for the @xmath84 pair as @xmath85",
    ". then the @xmath86 mixing angle @xmath87 can be radiatively magnified , as we require for the atmospheric neutrino solution .    in the case",
    "( b ) , the neutrinos @xmath78 and @xmath79 need not be quasi - degenerate , so the magnitude of radiative corrections needed to magnify @xmath87 is large .",
    "accounting for the large @xmath87 through radiative magnification is then difficult .",
    "thus , if radiative magnification is the reason for the large @xmath87 , then the case ( a ) is favored , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath88 on the grounds of naturalness .",
    "we have shown that , with the parametrization @xmath89 of the lepton mixing matrix , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and a small @xmath92 at the low scale can satisfy all the constraints from the solar , atmospheric and chooz data .",
    "these mixing angles can be generated at the high scale with @xmath19 and small @xmath6 and @xmath5 ( which is natural in the quark - lepton unified theories ) , and magnifying @xmath5 through radiative corrections while keeping @xmath6 and @xmath7 unaffected .",
    "let us add a few words on the realization of this scenario of radiative magnification in the unified theories .",
    "we have not given any specific model realization , rather we have pointed out a class of models that would be successful in generating a large lepton mixing naturally , starting from a small mixing at the high scale .",
    "it is not hard to see that such small mixing angle patterns can emerge at the high scale @xmath2 in quark - lepton unified theories of type @xmath93 if the right - handed neutrino coupling is assumed to be an identity matrix since the dirac mass matrix for neutrinos that goes into the seesaw matrix is then identical to the up - quark mass matrix .",
    "thus even though our discussion in this paper is completely model independent , its realization in the context of unified theories is quite straightforward .",
    "our work thus demonstrates a way to have a natural solution for the neutrino anomalies in the quark - lepton unified theories .",
