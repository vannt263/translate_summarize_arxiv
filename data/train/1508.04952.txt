    "adaptive networks , where the dynamics of nodes is coupled to the dynamics of network links , have received considerable attention in the last decade  @xcite .",
    "this kind of networks represents not only a natural extension of models where either dynamics on complex networks or the origin of non - trivial topology of networks itself had been the focus of attention , but is in its own right a field of interest .",
    "indeed , in many natural systems node dynamics and network dynamics are intimately coupled , and their interplay captures important aspects that would be missed if both processes are not taken simultaneously into account .",
    "examples are , among many others  @xcite , neural networks , where neuron activity affects synaptic strength  @xcite , ecological networks , where population dynamics is coupled to food web structure  @xcite , catalytic networks , where the appearance of auto - catalytic sets formed by sufficiently abundant chemical species is essential for the maintenance of the system  @xcite , and where the explicit introduction of space leads to segregation of parasitic species that may otherwise disrupt network structure  @xcite , or generic models where distinct populations of nodes separate when connection strength is allowed to vary  @xcite .",
    "the coupling between node and link dynamics is especially relevant in social networks , where nodes are individuals , companies , human groups or countries , e.g. , and links represent social contacts of various kinds . in many of these networks",
    ", agents can actively change their interactions , thus causing a systematic modification of network topology .",
    "a well studied case is that of epidemics , where susceptible individuals may suppress their links with infected neighbors , leading to networks assortative in degree and to first - order transitions between healthy and endemic states  @xcite and even to infection suppression  @xcite .",
    "similar situations hold in socioeconomic contexts , where adaptive networks display an interesting phenomenology that includes phase transitions and hysteresis between dissimilar states of agents  @xcite and self - organization leading to broad wealth distributions  @xcite . in a broader scenario ,",
    "it has been shown that changes in the state of nodes coupled to rewiring of links systematically causes network fragmentation  @xcite .",
    "this fact seems to be enhanced by the spatial embedding of many social networks , which constraints interactions  @xcite and may induce the spatial separation of different socioeconomic classes  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we address the relationship between the demographic dynamics of human linguistic groups and the topology of their networks of spatial contacts .",
    "we present a model for an adaptive spatial network where neighboring relationships are determined by the growth of groups and their concomitant attempt to modify the total area they occupy .",
    "the model is based on two previous and independent observations regarding the organization of human groups . in  @xcite ,",
    "a mean - field model was introduced to reproduce the population - area relationship observed in human languages ; the spatial structure of groups did not play any essential role in explaining that observation , and thus was disregarded . as a consequence , that model can not describe the complex topology of the network of contacts that was later uncovered  @xcite",
    ". networks of contacts between linguistic groups reflect their spatial embedding and display a set of properties previously unseen in spatial networks . among others ,",
    "those networks have high intervality , a property shared with food webs  @xcite . inspired in this latter system , and in niche models which had successfully captured that property , a niche - like algorithm was proposed and shown to recover most topological features of language networks  @xcite .",
    "human demographic dynamics and the spread of populations on space , which determines their inter - group contacts , are two coupled processes . as we report in this contribution ,",
    "their mutual dependence is behind observed correlations between the population of a group and the number of spatial neighbors it has , and is needed to explain the appearance of assortative properties in empirical language networks .",
    "results from an adaptive network model that we here introduce are compared with several world regions and to the topology of the network of linguistic contacts in each of them .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the adaptive model for language networks .",
    "previous relevant results are summarized for the sake of completeness and clarity .",
    "section iii reviews data on human linguistic groups as used in this study , particularly emphasizing the meaning of model parameters . in section iv",
    ", we fit the model to empirical data and show how the adaptive model qualitatively and quantitatively , in most cases , reproduces the population - area relationship , the degree and shortest path distributions of empirical language networks ( in addition to other topological features ) , and non - trivial correlations between demography and topology .",
    "the paper finishes with an overall discussion and some proposals for model extensions and future research .",
    "the adaptive network model yields a dynamic network of interactions among groups arising from explicit demographic dynamics and competition for space . as the size of groups varies",
    ", their neighboring relationships are modified and possible conflicts with different groups sharing boundaries may ensue . the precise example used is the development of human linguistic groups in the last thousand years .",
    "first , we define demographic dynamics following current knowledge on the world population growth and suitable rules for inter - group contacts and conflicts .",
    "second , the network of contacts between groups is updated in the light of changes in the areas they occupy .",
    "the modeling of demographic dynamics is based on  @xcite .",
    "dynamics relies on a stochastic multiplicative process of the form @xmath0 for the size of each population @xmath1 , where the distribution of @xmath2 values is estimated from empirical data .",
    "this process describes the growth of linguistic groups  @xcite and reproduces the observation of a log - normal distribution of the number of speakers per language  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , demographic changes are coupled to variations in the area over which groups are spread .",
    "that model was devised with the goal of explaining the population ( @xmath3)-area ( @xmath4 ) relationship observed in human linguistic groups , which follows @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "relevant model parameters have been derived from world population estimations , as follows .",
    "there were about @xmath6 humans in year 1000  @xcite , while in year 2000 the world population reached @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "assuming an exponential growth in the last ten centuries , an average annual growth rate @xmath8 is obtained , and a dispersion @xmath9 can be associated to the process  @xcite .",
    "the simplest distribution for the stochastic growth rate @xmath2 is a uniform distribution of average @xmath10 and mean square dispersion @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "a constant number of languages in this time interval , equal to the current estimated linguistic diversity ( 6900 languages )  @xcite , is considered . though some languages may have appeared in the last millenium , and",
    "many others have disappeared , in this model we disregard language birth or extinction for the sake of simplicity . in a previous model that constitutes the basis for the demographic dynamics here implemented , it has been numerically shown that those two processes did not affect the statistical results  @xcite .",
    "as initial condition , we take uniform populations ( @xmath12 ) , and areas @xmath13 , in arbitrary units .",
    "numerical simulations show that changes in the initial condition do not affect in a significant way the final distribution of group sizes ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "dynamics are run for @xmath14 time steps to compare with current available data . in the scenario",
    "described , population dynamics are defined so as to agree with empirical observations .",
    "therefore , parameters @xmath10 and @xmath15 implicitly contain information on all processes that may have potentially affected demographic changes in the last millenium ( that is births and deaths , but also casualties due to wars or pandemic diseases , for example ) .",
    "this is also the reason to couple in a directed fashion population dynamics to areas .",
    "notice that the units of area remain undetermined to a multiplicative factor .",
    "the log - normal distributions of language sizes @xmath1  @xcite and areas @xmath16  @xcite imply that the log - transformed variables @xmath17 and @xmath18 for each linguistic group @xmath19 follow gaussian distributions . as a result , the stochastic multiplicative process in the original variables can be cast in the form of a stochastic additive process in @xmath20 and @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "the logarithmic number of individuals in a group therefore follows @xmath22 where @xmath23 is measured in years , and @xmath24 is randomly drawn at each time step from a uniform distribution @xmath25 in the interval @xmath26 , @xmath27 \\ , , \\ ] ] with mean value @xmath28 and half - width @xmath29 obtained when the original multiplicative process is mapped to an additive one  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the logarithmic area @xmath21 is assumed to obey @xmath30 the evolution of @xmath20 and @xmath21 is coupled following two rules :    1 .",
    "the area covered by a group shrinks when its population decreases : if @xmath31 , then @xmath32 is randomly drawn from a uniform interval @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "2 .   increases in the population size lead to conflict between group @xmath19 and one of its neighbors on the network of contacts between groups ( see below ) .",
    "a neighbor @xmath34 of node @xmath19 is chosen at random ; if its growth rate is smaller than that of @xmath19 , the area of @xmath19 grows , and _",
    "vice versa_. specifically , 1 .",

    "the _ spontaneous retreat _",
    "parameter @xmath39 measures to which extent log - areas spontaneously shrink when populations decrease .",
    "the _ outcome of conflicts _ is weighted through @xmath40 , which determines the associated benefit for the population with the faster growth and is , in general , different from @xmath39 .",
    "actually , mean - field fits to actual values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 at present have revealed a sub - linear relationship between population decrease and area reduction and a larger increase in areas as a result of conflicts , yielding @xmath41 for the six world regions analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "it remains to be seen whether this constraint remains in other world regions here analyzed , and whether the values of @xmath40 and @xmath39 in the current adaptive network model significantly deviate from mean - field results .",
    "space is effectively introduced in the form of a network of neighbors that coevolves with the demographic dynamics just described .",
    "the construction of the network is inspired in a static algorithm that used a given distribution of areas and contained the rules to construct a network of contacts between groups  @xcite .",
    "now , instead , the network is continuously updated taking into consideration the area associated to each node , as obtained in the previous step .",
    "neighboring relationships between nodes arise from an assumption on perimeter contact . based on geometric constraints",
    ", it can be assumed that the perimeter of node @xmath19 is comparable to the sum of perimeters of its potential neighbors up to a multiplicative factor , @xmath42 where the _ perimeter overlap _ @xmath43 measures the average fraction of perimeter of each neighbor that is shared with node @xmath19 . in general , @xmath44 as defined in eq .",
    " is a node - dependent quantity , but for simplicity we assume an effective value all across the network , such that @xmath44 will be substituted by its network average @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the number of nodes ( languages ) in the network .",
    "the network of contacts is generated in two steps :    1 .",
    "_ directed network generation . _",
    "given the ( arbitrarily ordered ) set of areas @xmath47 at time step @xmath23 , where @xmath48 , we draw _ directed _ links between each node @xmath19 and nodes at positions @xmath49 , until the upper bound of the rhs of eq .",
    "is first exceeded .",

    "_ transformation to an undirected network . _",
    "since spatial neighboring relationships are undirected , the previous network should be transformed to an undirected one .",
    "links may be added or removed so as to guarantee the symmetry of the adjacency matrix . for this purpose",
    "we introduce a _ symmetrization parameter _ @xmath58 .",
    "if a directed link @xmath59 does not have a reverse counterpart , @xmath60 , we draw a uniformly distributed random number @xmath61 in @xmath62 and add the missing link @xmath63 to the network if @xmath64 . if @xmath65 , the original link @xmath59 is removed . in any case",
    ", the relationship between @xmath19 and @xmath34 has been symmetrized after the process .",
    "note that this process affects neighboring relationships as defined in eq .",
    ", so it will be important to assess its eventual effect in the demographic and topological properties we aim at reproducing .     and the total area or population for the same ensemble .",

    "their local structure was shown to be equivalent to that of almost regular , one - dimensional networks , with the area playing the role of the niche variable  @xcite .",

    "summarizing , the dynamical niche model is characterized by four parameters : the spontaneous retreat @xmath39 , the outcome of conflicts @xmath40 , the average perimeter overlap @xmath76 , and the symmetrization parameter @xmath77 .",
    "data on linguistic groups stems from a collection by sil international ( http://www.ethnologue.com/ ) and a map developed by global mapping international ( world languagemapping system , http://www.gmi.org/wlms/index.htm ) . a detailed description of the database appears in the ethnologue  @xcite , from which information on 6900 extant languages , including their spatial distribution and number of speakers , can be found .",
    "each language is characterized by a centroid , which is a point in latitude - longitude coordinates that represents its average location .",
    "centroids are the nodes of linguistic groups .",
    "two nodes are linked if the groups they represent share spatial borders in any of the domains where a language is spoken ( note that the speakers of a language may occupy disconnected domains , a situation that is relatively frequent ) .",
    "the interested reader can find details on network construction in  @xcite .    in the present study",
    ", we are not taking into account languages which are widespread as a result of colonization .",
    "languages such as english , spanish or portuguese in the americas , or mandarin chinese in asia , are in several senses outsiders : they percolate across continental regions and act as hubs in networks of contacts between linguistic groups , enhancing the formation of large connected components in language networks  @xcite .",
    "the number of neighbors of widespread languages ( that is , their degree @xmath72 ) is several - fold higher than that of other languages in the same network , thus significantly deviating from the bulk degree distribution . in this sense",

    "these correlations can not be observed if demography and topology are uncoupled : demographic dynamics without an underlying network of contacts correspond to a mean - field model without spatial structure ; a static algorithm that reproduces network topology is unable to account for correlations in population sizes , a variable disregarded in the algorithm .",

    "we have shown that previous known properties of this system are robustly reproduced : population - area relationships and language network topology .",
    "besides , a number of features relating demography and topology , as well as certain assortative properties of those networks , are consistently obtained in the adaptive network approach here introduced .",
    "assortativity in node population , area and degree are by - products induced by subsequent cycles of population change and modification of topological neighborhoods which can not be obtained in scenarios where these two processes are decoupled .",
    "remarkably , the agreement between several empirical and simulated quantities is obtained through fits of just four model parameters .",
    "we believe this is due to the deep meaning of model rules , which are by themselves sufficient to explain the qualitative properties of linguistic groups and their associated spatial networks .",
    "there is an important exception that can not be recovered by the model , in particular the population - area relationship , which fails to be reproduced already by the mean field approach  @xcite : new guinea island .",
    "since this is an often studied example of a region with an extremely high linguistic diversity , it is worth mentioning that the demographic and conflict rules we implement do not suffice to yield the @xmath83 value empirically measured . in general",

    "the adaptive network model here presented admits a number of extensions .",
    "first , the introduction of additional factors may make it more realistic . in this study",
    ", we have not considered the appearance of new languages or the death of existing ones .",
    "the origination of new languages can be easily implemented by splitting an existing language .",
    "following our rules , a new set of neighbors and an independent evolution of either population appear in a straight way .",
    "death of languages can also be considered , for instance , by eliminating those groups whose population falls below a prescribed level ( one individual , for instance ) .",
    "quantities such as the average lifetime of languages could be studied in this scenario .",
    "second , model rules could be modified to consider ingredients such as language attractiveness or frequency of conflicts dependent on degree or population size  @xcite .",
    "language attractiveness is an important driver in the disappearance of minority languages  @xcite , and could be implemented through a migration of population from one language to any of its neighbors . in this way , population sizes would be modified through processes different from stochastic growth .",
    "extreme versions of migration mechanisms might account for the growth of widespread languages  @xcite , and perhaps explain the emergence of dragon kings in linguistic groups  @xcite . in the model here",
    "used , every group enters into conflict with a neighbor once per time step .",
    "this rule could be modified to a likely more realistic version where conflict frequency is proportional to the number of links , and not to the number of nodes , and the outcome of conflicts could also consider the relative population of the involved parties .",
    "also additional cultural markers , as political , linguistic or religious similarities , might modify the frequency and strength of conflicts .",
    "the results of these modifications are difficult to foresee .",
    "third , the formation of links is now homogeneous and does not consider the structure of human settlements in relation to the landscape .",
    "the introduction of preferential attachment depending on stylized landscape features might help explaining the appearance of a low dimensional niche space in language networks  @xcite .",
    "the competition for areas between neighbouring populations is a form of demographic conflict . in",
    "the scenario here devised , these conflicts do not affect population sizes and by definition occur at a characteristic time scale of the order of one year .",
    "there is a body of literature that has addressed the frequency and distribution of conflicts with the number of casualties in terrorist attacks  @xcite , wars  @xcite , or fatal quarrels in general  @xcite as main variable .",
    "those events might have frequencies measured in days and have been often modeled as processes of fragmentation and coalescence of groups  @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to integrate the dynamical network perspective of our study with the fast evolution of groups dynamics and its effect on population sizes of these other conflict analyses with the goal of devising more complete models for cultural and political clashes .    finally , we believe that the model could be applied to other model systems with analogous node and network dynamics .",
    "one such example is ecology , where an explicit competition for space of species occupying the same niche is known to occur .",
    "further , the applicability of the model to that system is supported by a relationship between population sizes and ranges of occupation functionally equivalent to the population - area law followed by human linguistic groups .",
    "demographic dynamics similar to those used here , perhaps with the addition of temporal biases to grow or decrease , might represent the dynamics of agents such as companies or religious groups , for example .",
    "suitable modifications of how links are established might shed light on the distribution of group sizes and on the relevance of competition and inter - group conflicts .",

    "it can be shown that the dispersion in the distribution of language sizes at the beginning of the stochastic process ( one thousand years ago ) has a negligible contribution to the value of @xmath15 ( at most 0.5% , obtained from the limit situation where each language had one single speaker ) .",
    "the figure here reported stems thus from a multiplicative stochastic process in population growth with arbitrary initial conditions , average value 1.0029 , and a mean square dispersion caused by that of the current distribution of extant languages .",
    "see [ 19 ] for a full derivation of parameters @xmath10 and @xmath15 .",
    "note that the distribution of @xmath24 is related to the distribution of the ( untransformed ) growth rate @xmath2 as @xmath106 , with @xmath107 .",
    "then @xmath108 and @xmath109 is derived from the relation between the two distributions .",

    "<S> the distribution of human linguistic groups presents a number of interesting and non - trivial patterns . </S>",
    "<S> the distributions of the number of speakers per language and the area each group covers follow log - normal distributions , while population and area fulfill an allometric relationship . </S>",
    "<S> the topology of networks of spatial contacts between different linguistic groups has been recently characterized , showing atypical properties of the degree distribution and clustering , among others . </S>",
    "<S> human demography , spatial conflicts , and the construction of networks of contacts between linguistic groups are mutually dependent processes . here </S>",
    "<S> we introduce an adaptive network model that takes all of them into account and successfully reproduces , using only four model parameters , not only those features of linguistic groups already described in the literature , but also correlations between demographic and topological properties uncovered in this work . besides their relevance when modeling and understanding processes related to human biogeography , our adaptive network model admits a number of generalizations that broaden its scope and make it suitable to represent interactions between agents based on population dynamics and competition for space </S>"
