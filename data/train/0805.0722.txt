    "<S> a new class of high temperature superconductors based on iron and arsenic was recently discovered @xcite , with superconducting transition temperature as high as 55@xmath0k @xcite . here we show , using microscopic theory , that the normal state of the iron pnictides at high temperatures is highly anomalous , displaying a very enhanced magnetic susceptibility and a linear temperature dependence of the resistivity . below a coherence scale @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> the resistivity sharply drops and susceptibility crosses over to pauli - like temperature dependence . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the coherence - incoherence crossover temperature is a very strong function of the strength of the hund s rule coupling @xmath2 . on the basis of the normal state properties , we estimate @xmath2 to be @xmath3ev . in the atomic limit </S>",
    "<S> , this value of @xmath2 leads to the critical ratio of the exchange constants @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> while normal state incoherence is in common to all strongly correlated superconductors , the mechanism for emergence of the incoherent state in iron - oxypnictides , is unique due to its multiorbital electronic structure .    </S>",
    "<S> the unusually high superconducting critical temperatures in iron - oxypnictides together with unusual normal state properties , which do not fit within the standard framework of the fermi liquid theory of solids , place the iron pnictides in the broad category of strongly correlated superconductors , such as @xmath5 organics , cerium and plutonium based heavy fermions , and cuprate high temperature superconductors . in all these materials , </S>",
    "<S> superconductivity emerges in close proximity to an incoherent state with unconventional spin dynamics , that can not be describe in terms of weakly interacting quasiparticles . describing the normal state of these materials , is one of the grand challenges in condensed matter theory and has resulted in numerous controversies in the context of the cuprates .    </S>",
    "<S> iron pnictides show very high resistivity and very large uniform susceptibility in the normal state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> superconductivity emerges from a state of matter with highly enhanced pauli like type of susceptibility @xcite . as a function of f@xmath6 doping , </S>",
    "<S> the susceptibility is peaked around 5% doping reaching a value 25 times bigger than pauli susceptibility given by lda @xcite . in the parent compound , </S>",
    "<S> the resistivity exhibits a peak at 150@xmath0k @xcite followed by a sharp drop , which is due to a structural transition from tetragonal ( space group p4/nmm ) to orthorhombic structure ( space group cmma ) @xcite followed by a spin density wave transition @xcite at lower temperature . </S>",
    "<S> only a 5% doping completely suppress the specific heat anomaly @xcite , while resistivity still shows a very steep drop below a characteristic temperature @xmath1 @xcite . while there are suggestions that the drop of resistivity is due to opening of a pseudogap and proximity to a quantum critical point in samarium compound @xcite , other measurements in lanthanum compound seem to suggest less exotic and more fermi liquid - like resistivity at 10% doping level@xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we will show that the steep drop of resistivity in doped compounds can be understood on the basis of incoherence - coherence crossover , which is naturally accompanied by gradual screening of the magnetic moments , leading to enhanced magnetic susceptibility , and crossover from currie - weiss to pauli type susceptibility .    </S>",
    "<S> theoretically , electron - phonon coupling is not sufficient to explain superconductivity in lao@xmath7f@xmath8feas @xcite and spin and orbital fluctuations need to be considered . </S>",
    "<S> the weak coupling approach based on rpa approximation has been carried out by several groups for a simplified two band model containing two orbitals , @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nature of the superconducting state and the pairing symmetry is apparently very sensitively to the parameters of the model , and therefore it is very desirable to reliably determine parameters of a microscopic hamiltonian , which is the purpose of this article .    </S>",
    "<S> the electronic structure of the lao@xmath7f@xmath8feas compound was studied by the density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite and the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> dft calculations show that this material has a well separated set of bands with mostly @xmath11 character in the interval between @xmath12ev and @xmath13ev around the fermi level @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the parent compound has five fermi surface sheets @xcite , two electron cylinders , centered around the zone edge ( m - a line ) , and three hole pockets around the zone center ( @xmath14-z line ) . upon doping with electrons , </S>",
    "<S> the hole - like pocket quickly disappear . </S>",
    "<S> the nesting wave vector between the hole and electron pocket promotes the spin density wave instability which was actually observed in experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> notice however that the bragg peak in neutron experiments remains commensurate and does not change with doping , pointing to the inadequacy of the weak coupling spin density wave scenario .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ probab ] sketches the crystal field levels , as obtained by the local density approximation ( lda ) , when the localized wannier orbitals are constructed for fe-@xmath15 states . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the tetragonal splittings are comparable to the t2g - eg splittings , leaving only two degenerate orbitals , i.e. , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> notice however , that the bandwidth of these orbitals , as shown in fig.3 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , is of the order of 3@xmath0ev , which is one order of magnitude larger than the crystal field splittings .    </S>",
    "<S> a naive atomic picture suggests a large magnetic moment on the fe atom ( @xmath18 ) , and consequently almost classical moments , which can not condense by copper pairing , but would rather order magnetically , just like they do in pure iron . due to degeneracy of @xmath16 and @xmath17 </S>",
    "<S> orbital , even an infinitesimal hund s rule coupling would therefore lead to a spin state of at least @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> dynamical mean field studies @xcite , showed that the correlations in the parent compound are strong enough to make this material a bad metal with a large electronic scattering rate at , and below room temperature , as seen in the momentum resolved photoemission spectra , and the absence of a drude peak in the optical conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> however , it was argued in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , that the correlations are _ not _ strong enough to open the mott gap in the parent compound , in contrast to the hole doped cuprates , which are known to be doped mott insulators . </S>",
    "<S> the dmft study determined laofeas , to be a strongly correlated metal , which is not well described by either atomic physics , nor band theory . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it was shown that all the five iron @xmath11 orbitals have appreciable one particle density of states within @xmath20ev of the fermi level , and therefore a realistic minimal model for these materials should contain all five @xmath11 iron orbitals .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we use the lda+dmft method @xcite in combination with the continuous time quantum monte carlo method @xcite , to investigate the transport and thermodynamic properties of the 10% doped lao@xmath7f@xmath21feas compound . </S>",
    "<S> more details of the method are given in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our goal is to understand why a material with high orbital degeneracy , which naively would have expected to be an excellent metal @xcite , exhibits strong correlation effects , and what determines the crossover from the incoherent regime to the coherent fermi liquid state . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the hund s rule coupling @xmath2 dramatically reduces the coherence scale @xmath1 in these compounds , and promotes the highly incoherent metallic state .    in physical terms , </S>",
    "<S> correlated quasiparticles are spin one half objects that have to be built from atomic states , which are dominantly @xmath18 and @xmath19 , in the presence of hund s rule coupling . as a result , the overlap of the quasiparticle and the bare electronic states is very small .    to understand the nature of the metallic incoherent state , it is useful to study the probability that an electron in this compound is found in any of the atomic states of iron @xmath15 orbital . </S>",
    "<S> this is plotted in the atomic histogram in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ probab ] introduced in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even the most probable atomic states have probability of only a few percent , hence a naive atomic limit is qualitatively wrong for this compound . </S>",
    "<S> the atomic histogram , characterizes the nature of the ground state of the material . to investigate the coherence incoherence crossover </S>",
    "<S> , we need to probe the excitation spectra , through the transport and the thermodynamic probes .    </S>",
    "<S> we first turn to the magnetic susceptibility which is the most direct probe of the spin response : @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the spin of the iron atom , @xmath24 is a magnetic moment of a free electron , @xmath25 is the avogadro number , and @xmath26 is the inverse temperature . in the absence of screening ( static @xmath23 ) , susceptibility should follow the curie - weiss law @xmath27 . in the opposite itinerant limit , </S>",
    "<S> the spin susceptibility exhibits pauli response @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the density of state at zero frequency . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ chirho]a , we show the local spin susceptibility for a few values of hund s coupling @xmath2 in 10% doped compound .    in the absence of @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> the susceptibility obeys the pauli law , and the mass enhancement due to correlations is negligible . on the other hand , at large @xmath30ev </S>",
    "<S> , the system remains in the local moment regime down to lowest temperature we reached ( 50@xmath0k ) . </S>",
    "<S> for some intermediate values of hund s coupling @xmath31ev , the system evolves from an incoherent metal at high temperature , to the coherent fermi liquid at low temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> the metallicity of the compound always leads to screening of the electron magnetic moments , which eventually disappear at sufficiently low temperature and frequencies , but are present at high temperature and high energies . </S>",
    "<S> the scale at which the screening of the local moment takes place , however , is a very sensitive function of of the strength of the hund s coupling , being very large for @xmath32 and unobservably small for @xmath33 in the temperature range considered . </S>",
    "<S> this is one of the main messages of this article .    to shed light into the coherence - incoherence crossover , we computed the resistivity due to electron - electron interactions , given by @xmath34\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 are velocities of electrons </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath36 is the spectral density of the electrons , and @xmath37 is the volume of the unit cell . the resistivity in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ chirho]b demonstrates the crossover even clearly . </S>",
    "<S> the resistivity is approximately linear with modest slope above the coherence crossover temperature , and it exhibits a steep drop around the coherence temperature . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to stress that the drop of resistivity here is not due to proximity to a quantum critical point @xcite , or due to proximity to spin density wave @xcite , but because the electrons , being rather localized at high temperature , start to form a coherent quasiparticle bands with the underlying fermi surface .    in most compounds , </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the correlations is controlled by the ratio of the diagonal on - site coulomb interaction @xmath38 to the bandwidth , while hund s coupling usually plays a sub - leading role . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in this compound , a crucial role is play by the hund s coupling . </S>",
    "<S> this point was first noticed in the context of a two band hubbard model calculation at half - filling @xcite , and it was shown that the coherence scale is exponentially suppressed when hund s coupling is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it was emphasized that the non - rotationally invariant hund s coupling , usually assumed in combination with traditional quantum monte carlo methods @xcite , can lead to a qualitatively and quantitatively wrong results . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we have found that the absence of the rotational invariant hund s coupling leads to a first order phase transition as a function of @xmath2 , between a fermi liquid and non - fermi liquid state at zero temperature . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the rotational invariance of the coulomb interaction recovers fermi liquid at zero temperature , although the coherence scale can become very small , as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ chirho]b for @xmath33 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that the atomic @xmath2 in iron is approximately @xmath39ev . in many materials with correlated @xmath40 orbitals , </S>",
    "<S> the screening of @xmath2 in solid is well accounted for by 20% reduction from its atomic value . in laofeas compound , only 30% of the atomic hund s coupling gives the best agreement with experiment for resistivity and susceptibility .    to elucidate the sensitivity of mass enhancement with varying hund s coupling </S>",
    "<S> , we show low temperature specific heat in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cvex ] . for small @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> we find specific heat value very close to the lda prediction @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath42ev , a value which gives resistivity in very favorable agreement with experiments , requires the enhancement of the specific heat for factor of 5 to @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> this is large enhancement and should be easy to measurable in future experiments , and is a key prediction of the theory . </S>",
    "<S> this would be a strong test that a local theory , as the one described in this paper , correctly predicts the physical properties of this material , since would allow to differentiate it from paramagnon or itinerant spin density wave theories , where the enhancement of the static susceptibility is much larger than the enhancement of the specific heat . at this point , </S>",
    "<S> reliable data for the normal state specific heat of the doped compound is not available down to sufficiently low temperature to reliably extract the coefficient @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> it would be interesting to measure it in the slightly doped compound ( @xmath45 ) , where the superconducting temperature is low enough , and susceptibility shows the strongest enhancement .    </S>",
    "<S> the full computation of the momentum dependent spin response within lda+dmft is still a formidable task . </S>",
    "<S> however one can gain insights into the momentum dependence of @xmath46 by making a simplifying assumptions , that near the mott transition @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the fourier transform of the exchange constants , and @xmath49 is a local but frequency dependent object .    </S>",
    "<S> we computed the first neighbor @xmath50 and next - nearest neighbor @xmath51 exchange constants as a function of hund s coupling . for this purpose , </S>",
    "<S> we first constructed wannier orbitals from iron @xmath15 bands ( see appendix [ appa ] ) , we exactly diagonalized the iron atom , and perform the second order perturbation theory , with respect to iron - iron hopping . </S>",
    "<S> this perturbation is carried out around the atomic ground state of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 sector .    </S>",
    "<S> fig  [ cvex]b shows the exchange constants as a function of the hund s rule coupling . </S>",
    "<S> this provides complementary information to the exchange constants computed around the band limit , which were recently determined by lda @xcite , and are typically larger in magnitude than those obtained here . </S>",
    "<S> the exchange constants are supportive of the actual ordering in the parent compound , determined recently by the neutron scattering experiment@xcite , if @xmath52 . for reasonable hund s coupling , both @xmath19 and @xmath18 ground states respect this inequality . </S>",
    "<S> if we select the @xmath19 state for the ground state , the next - nearest @xmath51 is much bigger than @xmath50 . for the actual ground state of the atom ( @xmath18 ) , and realistic </S>",
    "<S> @xmath53 , the value of @xmath51 is close to @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that according to a well known result @xcite , this particular choice of exchange constants results in large magnetic fluctuations due to frustration . at temperature above the spin density wave transition </S>",
    "<S> , there can also be a second order ising phase transition , at which the two sublattice magnetizations of the two interpenetrating neel sublattices , lock together . according to ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the ising transition would occur around @xmath55 .    </S>",
    "<S> the large value of the next nearest neighbor exchange constant demonstrates that even in the atomic limit , the system is highly frustrated , as pointed out in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which gives us more confidence that the single site dmft description , employed in this article , is adequate , and the momentum dependent self - energy , as obtained by the cluster extensions of dmft @xcite , will not qualitatively change the physics .    from the above provided evidence </S>",
    "<S> , lao@xmath7f@xmath8feas system fits nicely within the general rubric of strongly correlated superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> the hallmark of this phenomena , is the appearance of a incoherent normal state , above @xmath56 . in the classic bardeen - cooper - schrieffer theory of superconductivity , </S>",
    "<S> the effective fermi energy is much larger than the pairing interaction , resulting in small critical temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> strong correlations play the role of reducing the the kinetic energy , allowing the pairing interactions to lead to appreciable critical temperatures @xcite .    while these are common themes shared by all the high @xmath56 materials , the mechanisms by which different systems manage to renormalize down their kinetic energies , and the details of the competing states that appear as a result , are different in different classes of materials . </S>",
    "<S> hole doped cuprate superconductors can be modeled as a single - band materials , with coulomb correlation slightly above the mott transition ( in dmft terminology the effective @xmath38 , which arises from the charge transfer energy , is above @xmath57 ) , and indeed maximal @xmath56 is achieved when @xmath38 is in the vicinity of critical @xmath57 .    we have argued in our earlier publication @xcite , that the laofeas is an intrinsically multiorbital system , which is slightly _ below _ @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism which is responsible for the incoherence of the normal state and the renormalization of the kinetic energy is the hund s rule @xmath2 , which we estimate here to be @xmath58 ev . </S>",
    "<S> competing states in this material are magnetic states , that have been predicted in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and since observed by neutron scattering experiments @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the incoherent normal states , is then eliminated by either a magnetic or a superconducting state , and the study of the competition between these mechanism in the multiorbital framework , deserves further attention . </S>"
