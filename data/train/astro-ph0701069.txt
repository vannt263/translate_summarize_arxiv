    "recent observations with the high energy stereoscopic system ( hess ) and other modern very high energy ( vhe ) telescopes have revealed a rich population of tev @xmath9-ray sources ( aharonian et al .",
    "a significant fraction of these sources are associated with various types of known astrophysical phenomena ( see ong 2006 for a review ) .",
    "the list of galactic tev sources with firm associations includes high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , supernova remnants ( snrs ) , and pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) .",
    "extragalactic tev sources are so far represented only by agns ( mostly blazars ) .",
    "many of the newly discovered tev sources are extended and resolved in the hess images .",
    "most of the identified extended sources are pwne and snrs , although there is an indication that some hmxbs could also produce extended tev emission ( e.g. , hess  j1632478 ; aharonian et al .",
    "2006a , hereafter ah06 ) . among the known galactic tev sources , only hmxbs are variable in tev , some of them showing variations with the binary orbital period ( e.g. , the microquasar ls  5039 , aharonian et al .",
    "the extragalactic agn sources appear to be point - like at tev energies and can also be variable .",
    "a quarter of the @xmath10 vhe sources known to date do not have firm identifications , although possible counterparts / associations have been suggested for some of them .",
    "hess  j1804216 ( hereafter hess  j1804 ) , the brightest among such sources , has been recently discovered during the hess galactic plane scan in 2004 may  october ( aharonian et al .",
    "the `` best - fit position '' of the source ( which is close to , but may be different from , the peak in the tev brightness distribution ; see ah06 for definition ) is r.a.=@xmath11 , decl.=@xmath12 , with a 13 uncertainty in each of the coordinates .",
    "the distribution of the tev brightness shows an extended source with elongated morphology ( see the contours in fig .",
    "17 of ah06 ) .",
    "the size of the source , @xmath13 , substantially exceeds the size of the hess point spread function ( psf ) , @xmath14 for this observation ( ah06 ) .",
    "the large extent of the tev emission rules out its association with an agn , which means that hess j1804 is a galactic source .",
    "ah06 point out that the tev emission does not perfectly line up with any known sources in the field . among possible counterparts ,",
    "ah06 mention the young vela - like pulsar b180021 and the snr  g8.70.1 , both of which have been detected in x - rays ( kargaltsev , pavlov , & garmire  2006a and finley & gelman 1994 , respectively ) .",
    "ah06 also do not dismiss the possibility that hess  j1804 and other unidentified tev sources belong to a new class of objects sometimes dubbed `` dark particle accelerators '' ( aharonian et al .",
    "2005a ) because of the apparent lack of counterparts outside the tev band .",
    "following the discovery of hess  j1804 , the field was observed in x - rays by the _ swift _ x - ray telescope ( xrt ) instrument on 2005 november 3 ( landi et al .",
    "2006 ) and _ suzaku _ x - ray imaging spectrometers ( xis ) on 2006 april 6 ( bamba et al .  2006 ) .",
    "landi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) detected three x - ray sources in the @xmath15 _ swift _ xrt detector field - of - view ( fov ) , at distances of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 ( positional uncertainty @xmath19@xmath20 ) from the best - fit hess position ( we will call them sw1 , sw2 , and sw3 hereafter ) .",
    "sw1 and sw2 had been previously detected with _",
    "rosat_. sw1 (= 1rxs  j180404.6215325 ) , the brightest of the 3 sources , shows a very soft thermal - like spectrum ( @xmath21 kev for an optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung model ) , and it is positionally coincident with a bright star outside the extension of the tev source .",
    "the spectra of sw2 (= 1wga  j1804.0 - 2142 ) and sw3 could not be measured because of the small numbers of counts detected ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 counts , respectively , in the 11.6 ks exposure ) .",
    "sw2 could also be associated with a star close to the boundary of the xrt error circle , while sw3 , closest to the center of hess  j1804 , did not show obvious counterparts at other wavelengths .",
    "the subsequent deeper ( 40 ks ) _ suzaku _ xis observation revealed two distinct x - ray sources ( suzaku  j18042142 and suzaku  j18042140 ; su42 and su40 hereafter ) in the @xmath24 xis fov .",
    "su40 is positionally coincident with sw3 within the large ( @xmath25 ) positional uncertainty of _ suzaku _ xis .",
    "bamba et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found that su40 is extended ( or multiple ) while su42 is unresolved at the _ suzaku _ resolution ( half power psf diameter @xmath26 ) .",
    "spectral fits with a power - law ( pl ) model show markedly different spectral parameters for the two sources .",
    "su42 was found to be unusually hard ( photon index @xmath27 , the errors are at the 90% confidence for one interesting parameter ) with a moderate ( albeit rather uncertain ) hydrogen column density , @xmath28 .",
    "su40 showed a softer ( @xmath29 ) , strongly absorbed ( @xmath30 ) spectrum .",
    "the sources have comparable fluxes , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ergs @xmath3 s@xmath2 in 210 kev , for su42 and su40 , respectively . despite an appreciable probability of chance coincidence ( obvious from the _ chandra _ images in  2 ) , bamba et al .",
    "( 2006 ) conclude that both _ suzaku _",
    "sources are physically associated with hess  j1804 .",
    "they mention that the harder su42 could be an hmxb while the softer su40 could be either a pwn or , more likely , it could be associated with snr g8.70.1 .",
    "the authors also point out that the ratios of the @xmath9-ray flux of hess  j1804 to the x - ray fluxes of su42 and su40 are surprisingly high compared to those seen in tev sources with known associations , including snrs and pwne .",
    "thus , the _ swift _ and _ suzaku _ data do not provide a conclusive result on the nature of hess  j1804 , and its association with the found x - ray sources remains unclear .    in the course of our observation of psr b180021 and its pwn with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ , the most interesting part of the hess  j1804 field happened to be within the fov .",

    "we serendipitously observed the field of hess  j1804 with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) on board _ chandra _ on 2005 may 4 .",
    "the total useful scientific exposure time was 30,236 s. the observation was carried out in faint mode .",
    "the aim point was chosen on s3 chip , near the psr b180021 position ( see kargaltsev et al .",
    "in addition to s3 , the s0 , s1 , s2 , i2 , and i3 chips were turned on .",
    "the detector was operated in full frame mode which provided time resolution of 3.24 seconds .",

    "figure 1 shows the acis image of the hess  j1804 field with overlaid tev contours , extracted from figure 17 of ah06 .",
    "the brightest portion of hess  j1804 falls onto the i3 and i2 chips , its best - fit position is offset by @xmath33 from the aim point .",
    "we searched for possible x - ray counterparts within the hess  j1804 extension and found a relatively bright source , which we designate cxou  j180432.4@xmath0214009 ( hereafter ch1 ) , located at @xmath34 , @xmath35 ( the @xmath36 centroid uncertainty is 038 in r.a . and 032 in decl . ; the @xmath36 error in absolute _ chandra _ astrometry is @xmath37 for each of the coordinates ) , well within the brightest portion of hess  j1804 and just @xmath38 north of the best - fit position ( ah06 ) .",
    "although ch1 appears to be slightly extended in the acis image , a psf simulation shows that this is likely the result of the off - axis location ( off - axis angle @xmath39 ) , which is also responsible for the relatively large centroiding uncertainty quoted above .",
    "the position of ch1 is consistent ( within the uncertainties ) with that of sw3 and su40 ( see  1 ) .",

    "however , when we filter out photons with energies @xmath45 kev ( which effectively reduces the background by a factor of 2.7 ) and bin by a factor of 8 ( i.e. , the new pixel size is 39 ) , an extended ( or multiple ) source becomes visible , with a size of @xmath46 ( see fig .  2 ) .",

    "ch3 is consistent with being point - like , while ch4 is either extended or , more likely , multiple .",
    "we also attempted to search for signatures of diffuse emission ( e.g. , an snr ) on the i3 chip .",
    "a direct visual inspection of the acis image did not show clear signatures of large - scale diffuse emission .",
    "we applied the exposure map correction and smoothed the image with various scales , but failed to find statistically significant deviations from a uniform brightness distribution . to estimate an upper limit on the snr emission , we measured the count rate from the entire i3 chip ( with all identifiable point sources removed ) .",

    "the background was measured from a larger circular annulus ; it contributes about 15% to the total of 127 counts within the source extraction region .",
    "we group the spectra into 10 spectral bins between 0.3 and 7 kev . the spectrum of the source ( shown in fig .",
    "3 ) is strongly absorbed , with only five counts below 2 kev ( the lowest photon energy is 0.35 kev ) .",

    ") reveal a large - scale diffuse emission with complex morphology .",
    "however , the ir brightness distribution does not correlate with the tev brightness ( shown by the contours in the same figure ) , nor with the large - scale x - ray brightness distribution seen in the archival _ rosat _ pspc image ( fig .  8 , _ top _ ) .",
    "the recently discovered radio source g8.310.09 ( see the nvss image in fig .  8 , _ bottom _ ) , classified as a possible snr ( brogan et al .  2006 ) , coincides well with the shell - like structure seen in the irac images ( fig .  7 , _ top _ ) , thus confirming that the source is indeed a new snr with an interesting ir morphology .",
    "we see from the _ chandra _ acis image ( fig .",
    "1 ) that the x - ray sky in the region of hess  j1804 is rich with point sources with fluxes of @xmath176 erg @xmath3 s@xmath2 , most of which are possibly stars . therefore , it is not surprising to find a few sources located relatively close to each other in this region of the sky .",
    "however , ch1 does not have a known ir / optical counterpart while ch2 appears to be extended , and both of them are located within the brightest part of hess  j1804 ( 19 and 25 from the best - fit tev position ) .",
    "this raises a possibility that at least one them is associated with the tev source .",
    "below we discuss whether ch1 or ch2 could be x - ray counterparts of hess 1804 , for several possible interpretations of the tev source . since the large extent of the tev emission rules out association with extragalactic sources , we limit our consideration to the galactic sources only .",
    "as there are several hmxbs among the identified tev sources ( see examples in table 2 ) , we can consider the possibility that hess j1804 is an hmxb and therefore may have a compact x - ray counterpart , such as ch1 or ch2 .",
    "it is believed that in hmxbs particles can be accelerated up to @xmath8 tev or even higher energies either in jets produced as the result of accretion onto a compact object ( e.g. , bosch - ramon 2006 and references therein ) or in the pulsar wind , if the compact object is an active pulsar ( e.g. , dubus 2006 ) .",
    "examples of such systems are the famous hmxb with the young psr b1259@xmath063 and the microquasars ls 5039 and lsi@xmath177 , for which the nature of the central engine ( ns or bh ) is still under debate .",
    "so far these are the only hmxb firmly detected in both the tev and gev bands .",
    "the ultra - relativistic particles can produce tev emission via the inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of the optical - uv photons emitted by the non - degenerate companion or through the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) process .",
    "hmxbs produce x - rays either in the course of accretion of the matter from the secondary companion onto the compact object or via the synchrotron radiation in the shocked pulsar wind .",
    "we see from table 2 that the tev - to - x - ray ( 110 tev to 110 kev ) flux ratio , @xmath178 , is @xmath179 for all the four hmxbs with more or less secure tev associations , much smaller than @xmath180 and @xmath181 for ch1 and ch2 , respectively .",
    "however , given the small size of the hmxb sample in table 2 and the fact that @xmath178 varies by at least a factor of 10 within the sample , it is possible that some hmxbs have a higher @xmath178 .",
    "indeed , most of accreting binaries are strongly variable x - ray sources , some of them being x - ray transients .",
    "for instance , igr  j163584726 , which is likely associated with hess  1634472 ( ah06 ) , is a strongly variable x - ray source , with the 2@xmath010 kev flux varying by a factor of @xmath182 ( patel et al .",
    "2004 ; mereghetti et al .",
    "this example demonstrates that the @xmath178 ratio in hmxbs may vary dramatically , especially in the cases when the tev and x - ray fluxes are not measured simultaneously .",
    "thus , the rather modest x - ray luminosities of ch1 and ch2 could be explained assuming that either of them is an hmxb in the low / hard state",
    ".    the hard ( @xmath183 ) x - ray spectrum of ch1 is strongly absorbed ; the hydrogen column density , @xmath184 , is a factor of 23 larger than the total galactic hi column ( @xmath185 @xmath3 ; dickey & lockman 1990 ) and a factor of 24 larger than the @xmath186 inferred from the x - ray spectrum of psr b180021 ( and its pwn ) located at the distance of @xmath187 kpc ( kargaltsev et al .",
    "taking into account that the @xmath188 value deduced from an x - ray spectrum under the assumption of standard element abundances generally exceeds the @xmath189 measured from 21 cm observations by a factor of 1.53 ( e.g. , baumgartner & mushotzky 2005 ) , the large @xmath188 ( consistent with @xmath190 ; e.g. , predehl & schmitt 1995 ) suggests that ch1 is either located within ( or even beyond ) the galactic buldge or it shows intrinsic absorption , often seen in x - ray spectra of hmxbs ( e.g. , walter et al .",
    "2006 ) .    as the spin periods of nss in hmxbs range from a fraction of second to thousands of seconds , the hmxb interpretation provides a plausible explanation for the putative 106 s periodicity in ch1 , which would be difficult to interpret otherwise . on the other hand ,",
    "the lack of an ir / nir counterpart is somewhat surprising , although the upper limits on the unabsorbed ir / nir fluxes ( see  2.4 and fig .",

    "however , only three hmxbs ( psr b125963 , ls 5039 and lsi@xmath177 ) have been identified with egret sources so far . the upper limit on gev flux , obtained from the egret upper limits map ( fig .  3 from hartman et al .",
    "1999 ) , is not deep enough to test the connection between the x - ray spectrum of ch1 and the tev spectrum of hess  j1804 ( see fig .",
    "the _ intergal _",
    "isgri upper limit ( a.  bykov 2006 , priv .",

    "is somewhat lower than that measured with _ suzaku _",
    "a year later ( see  2.2 ) , the difference is only marginal because of the large uncertainties of the measurements .",
    "however , if confirmed , the variability would be an argument supporting an hmxb interpretation of ch2 . on the contrary ,",
    "the rather large x - ray extent of ch2 [ @xmath193 pc ] argues against the x - ray binary interpretation to @xmath55 corresponding to physical lengths of 0.1 to 0.8 pc at the nominal distances to these systems . no tev emission has been reported from these hmxbs yet . ] .",
    "although possible x - ray emission from a nearby m - dwarf (  2.4 ) may contribute to ch2 , it can not account for the entire emission from this extended or multiple source .    even if either of the x - ray sources is an hmxb ,",
    "a major problem with its association with hessj1804 is the extended morphology of the latter .",
    "although , there is no an _ a priori _ reason to believe that hmxbs can not produce extended tev emission , the observational evidence for that is currently rather weak .",
    "so far , among the tev sources possibly associated with hmxbs , only two , hess  j1632478 and hess  j1634472 , might show extended tev emission ( ah06 ) , and the evidence for the extension is marginal in both cases .",
    ", h , and j bands ( see  2.4 ) . , width=259 ]    thus , although an hmxb at a distance of @xmath19415 kpc remains a plausible interpretation for ch1 and somewhat less plausible for ch2 , the association between them and the tev source is very questionable .",
    "an hmxb origin of ch1 or ch2 would be firmly established if the periodic ( and/or non - periodic ) variability is confirmed for ch1 ( or found for ch2 ) in a deeper x - ray observation , or a companion star is detected in the ir - optical . at the same time , a deeper on - axis observation with _",
    "chandra _ can measure the true extent and spatial structure of ch2 .      among other types of galactic x - ray sources , only snr shocks and pwne",
    "are believed to be able to produce extended tev emission .",
    "in fact , the second highest ( persistent ) tev - to - x - ray flux ratio , @xmath195 , in table 2 belongs to the pwn g18.00.7 around the vela - like pulsar b182313 ( @xmath196 erg s@xmath2 ; @xmath197 kpc ) , likely associated with hess  j1825137 ( ah06 ) .",

    "is observed around the vela pulsar ( @xmath202 erg s@xmath2 ; @xmath203 pc ) .",
    "an x - ray bright , compact ( @xmath204 in diameter ) pwn centered on the pulsar is accompanied by a much larger ( @xmath205 ) but dimmer asymmetric diffuse x - ray component ( sometimes referred to as `` vela x '' ) , which also has a tev counterpart ( aharonian et al .",
    "2006d ) .",
    "the asymmetry in the extended pwn components can be caused by the reverse snr shock that had propagated through the inhomogeneous snr interior towards the snr center and reached one side of the pwn sooner than the other side ( e.g. , blondin , chevalier , & frierson 2001 ) .",
    "the wind , produced by the pulsar over a substantial period of time ( up to a few kyrs ) and therefore occupying a substantial volume , could be swept up by the reverse shock wave into a smaller volume on one side of the pwn .",
    "the swept - up wind confined within the formed `` sack '' emits synchrotron radiation in x - rays . at the same time",
    ", the wind can produce tev radiation via the ics of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and synchrotron photons off the relativistic electrons decay , with @xmath206 being produced when the relativistic protons of the pulsar wind interact with the ambient matter ( horns 2006 ) .",
    "although the presence of the hadronic component in the pulsar wind has not yet been established observationally , it is expected to be present according to some pulsar wind acceleration models ( e.g. , arons 2005 ) . ] .",
    "the lorentz factor of the electron that upscatters the cmb photon to the energy @xmath207 is @xmath208",
    ". electrons with such lorentz factors emit synchrotron photons with energies @xmath209 kev .",
    "therefore , the observed tev spectrum of hess  j1804 , spanning from 0.2 to 10 tev ( ah06 ) , would correspond to the @xmath2100.6 kev range of the synchrotron photon energies in @xmath211 g .",
    "these euv and soft x - ray synchrotron photons are heavily absorbed at @xmath212 @xmath3 and hence are difficult to detect .",
    "thus , if the swept - up wind is cold enough [ e.g. , @xmath213 , the sack may be bright in tev but faint in the _ chandra _ band .",
    "furthermore , the magnetic field inside the sack is lower than that in the compact pwn , leading to a lower synchrotron brightness since the latter depends on the magnetic field strengths as @xmath214 for the pl distribution of electrons , @xmath215 .",
    "this could explain why the tev emitting region is dimmer in x - rays than the compact pwn populated with more energetic electrons , but it does not explain why the compact pwn shows lower surface brightness in tev than the extended asymmetric pwn .",
    "the brightness of the tev emission produced via the ics on cmb photons does not depend on the magnetic field ; therefore , the simplest explanation could be that the sack contains a larger number ( and perhaps a higher column density ) of the swept - up tev - emitting electrons compared to those within the compact pwn .",
    "one could try to apply the above interpretation to hess  j1804 , assuming that ch1 ( or ch2 ) is a pulsar with a pwn .",

    "the faintness of a possible extended pwn component could be at least partly attributed to the strong x - ray absorption in this direction . on the other hand ,",
    "ch2 is resolved by _ chandra _ into an extended x - ray source , which might be a pwn . however , the low s / n and the off - axis location hamper the assessment of the spatial structure and the spectrum of ch2 .",
    "the 3.24 s time resolution of the acis observation also precludes a search for sub - second pulsations expected from a young pulsar ( the putative 106 s period of ch1 is certainly too long for a young isolated pulsar and hence should be attributed to a statistical fluctuation in this interpretation ) . keeping in mind the above examples of vela x and g18.00.7 ,",
    "the large extent of hess  j1804 should not be alarming .",
    "a lack of strong asymmetry with respect to the pulsar , which is the distinctive feature of all the other extended tev pwne ( table 2 ; de jager 2006 ) , could be attributed to the low sensitivity of the _ chandra _ observation to extended emission of low surface brightness or to the projection effect ( i.e. , the tev pwn could be displaced from the pulsar along the line of sight ) .",
    "the large @xmath178 values cast additional doubts on the pwn interpretation ; however , even a luminous extended x - ray component of low surface brightness could remain undetected in the relatively shallow off - axis acis exposure . a deeper on - axis observation with _ chandra _ would test the nature of ch1 and ch2 and the pwn interpretation .",
    "overall , although not excluded , the possibility that ch1 or ch2 are the pulsars powering the tev pwn does not look very compelling at this point .    on the other hand , the association of hess  j1804 with the vela - like pulsar b180021 remains a plausible option . to date",
    ", young vela - like pulsars have been found in the vicinity of @xmath216 extended tev sources ( e.g. , de jager 2006 ; gallant 2006 ) .",
    "since both pulsars and tev sources are concentrated in the galactic plane , and the extended tev sources have typical sizes of @xmath217 , one could attempt to explain this by a chance coincidence",
    ". however , the probability of chance coincidence is low .",
    "for instance , within the @xmath218 square degrees area of the galactic plane , surveyed by hess ( ah06 ) the surface density of young ( @xmath219 kyrs ) pulsars is @xmath220 deg@xmath52 ( based on the atnf pulsar catalog data ; manchester et al .",
    "on the other hand , the same area includes four extended tev sources ( hess  j1825137 , hess  j1809193 , hess  j1804216 , and hess j1616508 ) located within @xmath221 from one of the young pulsars .",
    "since the probability of finding a young pulsar within an arbitrary placed r@xmath222 circle is only @xmath223% , the probability of accidentally having all the four tev sources within the @xmath221 distances from the young pulsars is negligible , @xmath224 .",
    "this strongly suggests a physical connection between the two phenomena ( e.g. , de jager 2006 ) .",
    "furthermore , there are several pairs , such as psrb083345/hessj0835455 , psrb150958/hessj1514591 , and psrb182313/hessj1825137 , for which the connection is supported by the correlation between the tev and x - ray brightness distributions .",
    "note , that in these pairs the pulsars are offset by @xmath225@xmath221 from the peaks of the tev brightness .    from the theoretical perspective , the `` crushed pwn '' hypothesis ( blondin et al .",
    "2001 ) , briefly discussed above , provides a possible explanation for the observed offsets . from the observational point of view , the associations are supported by the detection of large , asymmetric x - ray structures correlated with the tev brightness distributions and apparently connected to the pulsars . however , in several possible associations the existing x - ray images are not deep enough to reveal an extended pwn component . in particular , the x - ray images of the pwn around b180021 ( kargaltsev et al .",
    "2006a ) show a hint of a dim , asymmetric pwn component extended toward hess  j1804 , but the sensitivity of the _ chandra _ observation was possibly insufficient to detect the pwn beyond @xmath43@xmath226 from the pulsar .",
    "this is similar to psr  b182313 , where the arcminute - scale pwn was well seen only in a long _ xmm - newton _ observation , and only _ a posteriori _ a hint of it was found in the _ chandra _ data ( kargaltsev et al .",
    "hence , there is a good chance that psr  b180021 also has a dim , asymmetric pwn .",
    "it could be detected in a deep _ xmm - newton _ exposure , thereby establishing the association between hess  j1804 and psr  b180021 .",
    "while discussing the su40  ( = ch1 ) and su42  ( = ch2 ) association with hess  j1804 , bamba et al .",
    "( 2006 ) suggest that the x - ray and tev emission could come from an snr shock ( possibly in g8.7@xmath00.1 ) . in our opinion ,",
    "the fact that the angular extent of the two x - ray sources is much smaller than the extent of the tev emission ( see fig .",
    "1 ) is a strong argument against such an interpretation . nevertheless , a possibility that an snr ( so far undetected in x - rays ) could produce the observed tev emission in hessj1804 ( see fatuzzo , melia , & crocker 2006 ) can not be ruled out if the tev source is not associated with ch1 , ch2 , or psr b180021 .",
    "indeed , contrary to the conclusion by bamba et al .",
    "first , one should not use the uncertainty of the best - fit tev position for such an estimate when the tev source is clearly extended and asymmetric .",
    "second , as we see from fig .  1",
    ", the probability of finding an x - ray source with a flux of @xmath227@xmath228 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath3 within an arbitrary placed @xmath229 circle is quite high . ] , the close match in the sky positions of ch1 ( or ch2 ) and hess  j1804 can merely be a chance coincidence , and hess  j1804 may have no point - like x - ray counterparts down to the @xmath230 limiting flux of @xmath231 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath3 within the tev bright region .",
    "however , one can not exclude the presence of faint diffuse x - ray emission , e.g. from an snr whose image size exceeds the chip size .",
    "since it is difficult to estimate which fraction of the observed diffuse count rate ( 1.3 counts ks@xmath2 arcmin@xmath52 in the i3 chip ; see  2.1 ) comes from the background and what is the nature of the remaining flux ( e.g. , thermal emission from an snr or nonthermal emission from an extended pwn ) , we can only put an upper limit of @xmath232 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath3 on the 210 kev flux in the i3 chip area , corresponding to @xmath233 ( this estimate assumes @xmath234 and a pl model with @xmath235 ) .",
    "however , we do not see any significant large - scale ( in comparison with the off - axis psf size ) x - ray brightness variations in the acis image .",
    "( see figs .  1 and 2 ) .",
    "although such uniformity is somewhat unusual for an snr , we note that the interior of the shell - type snr rx  j1713.73946 ( resolved into a @xmath236 shell in tev ; aharonian et al .",
    "2004 ) is relatively faint and homogeneous in x - rays ( hiraga et al .",
    "furthermore , following kargaltsev et al .",
    "( 2006a ) , we conclude that if the x - ray spectrum and luminosity of the undetected snr are similar to those of the vela snr , the expected off - axis acis - i3 surface brightness is @xmath237 counts ks@xmath2 arcmin@xmath52 in the 0.57 kev band ( for the raymond - smith thermal plasma emission models with @xmath238 mk and @xmath234 ) , i.e.  at least a factor of 4 below the observed upper limit ( see  2.1.1 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the tev brightness distribution in hessj1804 poorly correlates with the radio brightness distribution .",
    "although located within the boundaries of g8.7@xmath00.1 , the region around hess  j1804 in the radio image is much dimmer than the northeast part of g8.7@xmath00.1 that also emits x - rays observed with _ rosat _ ( see fig .  8) .",
    "this , in our view , argues against the hess  j1804 and g8.7@xmath00.1 association ( see , however , fatuzzo et al.2006 , who argue that the tev emission can be produces by a shock in the g8.70.1 interacting with a molecular cloud ) .    a possibility that hess  j1804 is associated with the recently discovered faint radio ( and ir ) source g8.310.09 , likely an snr ( brogan et al .",

    "we serendipitously detected several x - ray sources , whose positions are close to the maximum of the tev brightness distribution of the extended vhe source hessj1804 . among these sources , only ch1 and ch2 might be related to hessj1804 .",

    "there also remains a possibility that ch1 is a new obscured pulsar / pwn couple , possibly associated with g8.7@xmath00.1 . in this case no variability is expected on time scales @xmath239 s , but one could expect to see an x - ray pwn , which has not been detected in the _ chandra _ observation possibly because of the off - axis placement on the acis detector",

    "<S> the second brightest source , cxou j180441.9@xmath0214224 , which has been detected with _ suzaku _ , is either extended or multiple , with the flux @xmath6 ergs @xmath3 s@xmath2 . </S>",
