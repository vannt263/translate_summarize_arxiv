    "this paper deals with the motion of a particle in a correlated random potential under the influence of a driving force .",
    "the correlations of the disorder are characterized by a short distance cutoff and a power law decay at larger distances with exponent @xmath0 .",
    "this problem has been solved in one dimension @xcite and , depending on @xmath0 , drift with finite mobility , creep or pinning was found .",
    "creep means that the particle moves with a mean velocity less than proportional to the driving force and in case of pinning the mean velocity is zero , unless the force exceeds some critical value .    in @xmath1 dimensions",
    "a mean field treatment becomes exact for @xmath2 and there is a close formal similarity to spin glass problems with long range interactions .",
    "the situation without external driving force has been treated within replica theory @xcite and also using a stochastic dynamics approach @xcite . actually",
    "the more general case of the motion of a @xmath3-dimensional manifold in an @xmath2 dimensional space was investigated . for finite @xmath1",
    "the mean field treatment is only an approximation .",
    "nevertheless it might give some clue about a great variety of systems with disorder , for instance flux lines in superconductors or interfaces in random field systems .    the close formal relation to spin glass problems",
    "raises another set of questions .",
    "there has been a continuous interest in the dynamics of spin glasses and related systems .",
    "the pioneering work of sompolinsky and zippelius @xcite concentrated in part on an understanding of the replica theory and the hierarchical replica symmetry breaking scheme proposed by parisi @xcite .",
    "the basic assumption was about the existence of a hierarchy of diverging time scales with ultrametric properties .",
    "this point has been investigated further @xcite introducing a long time scale @xmath4 associated with slow changes of the random interactions in this model .",
    "it could be shown that the above assumption meant that the long time contributions to the correlation and response functions have to be smooth functions of @xmath5 with @xmath6 .",
    "it was later shown @xcite that this led to inconsistencies which could not be resolved at that time .",
    "there exists a variety of models with disorder where a replica treatment requires only single step replica symmetry breaking instead of the hierarchical scheme mentioned above .",
    "the resulting phase transition can be considered as discontinuous in contrast to the continuous transition observed in the sk - model and other cases requiring hierarchical replica symmetry breaking . a treatment via dynamics @xcite revealed a dynamic freezing temperature above the transition temperature obtained in replica theory .",
    "this is in contrast to the continuous transitions where the same transition temperature is found .",
    "furthermore it could be shown @xcite that the states which contribute to dynamics have a higher energy than the states relevant for the replica calculation .",
    "numerical simulations of a learning process in a perceptron with binary bonds @xcite , another system with discontinuous transition , indicated that the replica result applies if the limit @xmath6 is performed first and then the limit @xmath2 , whereas the results obtained via dynamics hold for the opposite order .",
    "this observation suggests that in the thermodynamic limit the particular states most relevant for the replica calculation can not be reached within any finite time .",
    "this picture is consistent with the fact that finding the best groundstate in a spin glass or perfect learning in a perceptron with binary bonds is a combinatorial hard problem which can not be solved in polynomial time . the replica treatment , on the other hand ,",
    "is purely static and does not refer to any kind of dynamics . for a given physical situation the appropriate order of limits has of course to be found , keeping in mind that the longest equilibration times are likely to diverge exponentially with some power of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this raises the question whether similar discrepancies also show up in systems with continuous transition .",
    "the problem of the motion of a particle in a random potential under the influence of a driving force is in several aspects an appropriate model system to address this question . prescribing the drift velocity @xmath7 and calculating the force necessary to drive the particle , a long external time scale is defined by @xmath8 . for times exceeding @xmath9 the system",
    "is supposed to reach a stationary non - equilibrium state , a so - called flow state , where correlation and response functions depend on differences of time only .",
    "this is of great advantage regarding numerical as well as analytic work .",
    "depending on the exponent @xmath0 and on temperature , a continuous as well as a discontinuous transition can be found and therefore both cases can be studied on a single model .",
    "the results presented in the following are based on numerical integrations of the dynamic mean field equations of this model , extending over more than thirty orders of magnitude in time and velocity .",
    "such a wide range is actually necessary in order to understand the different scaling and crossover regimes emerging in this problem .",
    "such a wide range of time scales is not unrealistic keeping in mind that phenomena might be observed on a scale of days or more with an intrinsic time scale of @xmath10 to @xmath11 seconds typical for vibrational or electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "the numerical results are supplemented by exhaustive analytic work characterizing the different scaling regimes and focusing on their asymptotic properties and associated exponents .",
    "the characteristic time scales are obtained by matching between adjacent scaling regimes and are again governed by characteristic exponents .",
    "the key result of the present investigation is the observation that the dynamics with a long but finite external time scale @xmath9 is ruled by three regimes :    i ) : :    the fdt - regime describing local equilibrium at short times .",
    "ii ) : :    the intermediate plateau regime for times    @xmath12 with @xmath13 .",
    "iii ) : :    the asymptotic regime for @xmath14 .",
    "these regimes have additional substructures and associated additional internal time scales .",
    "the plateau regime is the crucial link between short times and long times of the order of the external time scale .",
    "its properties determine for instance whether creep or pinning is found or whether the longest internal time scale is proportional to @xmath9 or @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "this question is of relevance for instance in the context of aging phenomena @xcite .",
    "depending on @xmath0 and temperature , different phases are found .",
    "the phase diagram resulting from the present investigations is shown in fig.[phase - fig ] .",
    "there is a phase with finite mobility ( @xmath17 ) , another one with creep behavior ( @xmath18 ) and two more where pinning is observed ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the findings for the one - dimensional model @xcite , which indicates that the transitions are not an artifact of the mean field treatment . in all phases , except the high temperature phase @xmath17 ,",
    "additional intermediate time scales exist , which diverge for @xmath21 .",
    "there is , however , no ultrametric organization of time scales .",
    "this is in contrast to the common proposal @xcite .",
    "moreover , the phase diagram suggested by replica theory @xcite or dynamics within the hypothesis of ultrametric time scales @xcite differs from the one obtained in the present investigation . for instance , @xmath22 has been predicted for the @xmath23-@xmath19 phase boundary in contrast to @xmath24 found at present .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that the states dominating the replica theory with broken symmetry are again not the same as those relevant for dynamics on long but finite time scales .    as a consequence of the assumption of ultrametricity in the organization of diverging time scales , the resulting correlation and response functions were not unique @xcite . the present investigation yields on the other hand unique results and this problem is therefore removed .",
    "the inconsistencies @xcite mentioned above are also resolved in the sense that the proposed reparametrization of time @xmath5 is not appropriate .",
    "there has recently been a growing interest in the dynamics of glassy systems evolving from a non - equilibrium initial state @xcite .",
    "the situation there is more complicated because the problem is no longer homogeneous in time and response and correlation functions depend on two time arguments @xmath25 and @xmath26 . if , however , @xmath27 , one expects a behavior similar to the one investigated at present with @xmath26 taking over the role of @xmath9 .",
    "especially if both @xmath28 and @xmath26 diverge with @xmath29 , one should also expect the appearance of intermediate time scales and associated scaling regimes .",
    "this possibility has not been considered at full depth in the above work .    for short time @xmath28 correlation and response functions",
    "are related by fluctuation - dissipation theorems ( fdt ) .",
    "this is also the case in the present investigation .",
    "the different phases have , however , different scenarios of how fdt s are violated at longer time scales .",
    "since this happens for times @xmath30 , similar phases are expected for the above mentioned relaxation processes . in this context",
    "the non - equilibrium dynamics of the spherical sk - model investigated recently by cugliandolo and dean @xcite is of great interest , because this model does not require replica symmetry breaking in its low temperature phase .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : section 2 contains the definition of the model and the dynamic mean field equations , which have the form of coupled nonlinear integro - differential equations .",
    "it also contains the definition of effective time dependent exponents , which are widely used in the following .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the numerical integration of the dynamic mean field equations , to the presentation of results and to a preliminary identification of different time scales and scaling regimes .",
    "section 4 contains analytic results and estimates regarding time scales and scaling properties .",
    "it starts with the fdt - solution valid for short time and continues with a discussion of various convolution type integrals entering the self - energies . in bypassing the qfdt - solution @xcite and the hierarchical solution @xcite",
    "are brought up .",
    "it is then shown how to evaluate the above integrals using the time dependent effective exponents .",
    "this leads to a reformulation of the original mean field equations in terms of a set of 15 coupled ordinary and first order differential equations .",
    "this appears complicated but it allows a discussion of different scaling regimes in which only closed subsets of these equations are relevant .",
    "these regimes are in the order of increasing time the fdt - regime , the plateau regime , where the correlation function @xmath31 stays close to the asymptotic value @xmath32 of the fdt - solution , and finally the asymptotic regime for times of the order of the external time scale @xmath33 . a concluding discussion follows in section 5 and a brief derivation of the dynamic mean field equations is given in an appendix .",
    "a particle is investigated which moves under the influence of an external force @xmath34 in a random potential @xmath35 .",
    "the coordinates of the particle are written as @xmath36 assuming a mean velocity @xmath37 .",
    "this means that the components @xmath38 are measured in a frame moving with velocity @xmath39 along the @xmath40-direction .",
    "the scaling with @xmath41 ensures a nontrivial limit @xmath2 .",
    "the system is at a temperature @xmath42 and its hamiltonian is @xmath43 where a confining potential @xmath44 might be added to the random potential and the potential of the driving force .",
    "the following investigation is , however , restricted primarily to @xmath45 .",
    "the motion of the particle is governed by a langevin equation @xmath46 with gaussian white noise @xmath47 the quenched disorder is also assumed to be gaussian with @xmath48 and @xmath49 the strength and the short range cutoff of the disorder as well as the diffusion constant are set to one .",

    "they are also used in the evaluation of the convolution type integrals in the self - energies of the mean field equations ( [ r- ] ) and ( [ n- ] ) .",
    "the first two exponents are @xmath64 and @xmath65 with @xmath66 the third exponent @xmath67 is defined .",
    "the dynamic mean field equations to be solved consist of two integro - differential equations ( [ r-])and ( [ n- ] ) , a first order differential equation ( [ n - def ] ) , the definition of @xmath68 , ( [ w - def ] ) and ( [ f - def ] ) , and the integral ( [ mu - def ] ) determining @xmath69 .",
    "the second integral in ( [ n- ] ) and the integral ( [ mu - def ] ) extend overall times and therefore , evaluating the solution at some @xmath25 requires the knowledge of the solution at all times , not only at @xmath70 .",
    "this means that the equations have to be iterated .",
    "this is the price one has to pay for investigating a steady state situation .",
    "a study of the relaxation from a non - equilibrium initial state on the other hand is free of this problem , but it requires to deal with functions depending on two time arguments .",
    "the wide span of time arguments ranging from @xmath71 to @xmath72 requires a nonuniform discretization .",
    "the present calculation uses a homogeneous discretization of @xmath73 .",
    "the convolution type integrals in ( [ r- ] ) and ( [ n- ] ) can be evaluated by numerical integration using the values stored at the points of the above grid for one of the functions of the integrand and an interpolation for the other function .",
    "alternatively , an approximative evaluation of the integrals using effective exponents , described in section 4.4 is possible . for the actual calculation",
    "both methods have been combined .",
    "the mean field equations in the form written in section 4 consist of several coupled nonlinear differential equations of first order . they can be integrated forward or backward in time . in addition",
    "they have to be iterated .",
    "the situation resembles in some sense the problem of solving @xmath74 integrating forward in @xmath25 the solution typically approaches a fixed point @xmath75 with @xmath76 , whereas a fixed point with @xmath77 is reached integrating backward in @xmath25 . selecting an appropriate initial value @xmath78 somewhere between a fixed point with @xmath77 and an adjacent one with @xmath76 , the solution can easily be found by integration in both directions . for the complete set of equations such fixed point situations show up at the crossover between the various scaling regimes discussed below .",
