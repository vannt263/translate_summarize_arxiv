    "in late 19th century , due to the outstanding contribution of its founding fathers , boltzmann , maxwell and gibbs , statistical thermodynamics has been successfully introduced as the general conceptual framework for understanding equilibrium thermodynamic phenomena by means of statistical mechanics  @xcite .",
    "the early success of the kinetic theory of gases and the discovery of the mean field approach for the derivation of the classical van der waals equation  @xcite nurtured the hope that an equally neat and clear description of critical phenomena would be as effective as it was away from the critical region . although second order phase transitions , as for example the ergodicity breakdown of real gases at the triple point , have nowadays been completely framed into a rigorous scaffold  @xcite - also partially guided by techniques from the near field theory  @xcite - first order phase transitions , such as gas - liquid phase transitions , turned out to be more elusive .",
    "indeed , in spite of the accuracy of the celebrated van der waals equation for the description of real gases , the behavior predicted within the critical region , where a real gas turns into a liquid , significantly departs from the experimental observations .",
    "fig.[fig : g1a ] shows the typical isothermal curves of a real gas : above the critical temperature ( for @xmath2 ) the pressure decreases as a strictly monotonic function of the volume ; the critical point corresponds to the temperature @xmath3 where the critical isotherm develops an inflection point ; below the critical temperature ( at @xmath4 ) real isotherms are constant within a certain volume interval in spite of the oscillating behavior predicted by the classical van der waals equation .",
    "interestingly , the behavior of real isothermal curves within the critical region turns out to be intimately connected to the theoretical one via the celebrated maxwell rule stating that the constant pressure plateau is placed in such a way it cuts lobes of equal areas on the associated van der waals isotherm .",
    "as it is well known , the maxwell rule corresponds to the condition of thermodynamic equilibrium such that , below the critical temperature , the gibbs free energy develops two minima of equal value  @xcite .",
    "+ the remarkable validity , although heuristic , of maxwell s approach stimulated countless studies aimed at a rigorous statistical mechanical description of first order phase transitions as for instance in the works of lebowitz and penrose  @xcite and van kampen  @xcite , where large classes of pairwise interaction potentials for particles ( continuous and hard - sphere - like respectively ) are considered or the work by griffiths  @xcite that focusses on the study of analyticity properties of thermodynamic functions .",
    "alternative methods to analyze phase transitions have also been developed based on macroscopic approaches to thermodynamics .",
    "for instance , the landau theory allows to construct suitable asymptotic expansions of the free energy in the order parameters to obtain information of the critical exponents in the vicinity of the critical point ( see e.g.  @xcite ) ; the widom approach relies on the construction of effective free energy functions based on the analysis of their scaling properties  @xcite .",
    "further recent developments in this direction led to the formulation of the thermodynamic limit as the semiclassical limit of nonlinear conservation laws where phase transitions are associated to shock solutions of a hyperbolic nonlinear pde in the class of conservation laws  @xcite .",
    "such nonlinear pdes can be also derived in mean field theories from the analysis of differential identities of the free energy as showed in  @xcite for the curie - weiss and the sherrington - kirkpatrick models , or from the analysis of thermodynamic maxwell relations as showed in  @xcite for the van der waals model .",
    "both the microscopic statistical mechanical approach , via the study of correlation functions asymptotics , and the macroscopic thermodynamic approach , based on the expansion of the free energy in the vicinity of the critical point , show the intimate connection with the singularity and catastrophe theory - since the very first pioneering contributions by arnold - and the hopf bifurcation theory ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .     and",
    "@xmath5 the behavior predicted by the van der waals equation ( dashed line ) departs from the experimentally observed ( solid line ) .",
    "the actual critical isotherms are constructed starting from the theoretical ones via the maxwell equal areas rule . ]    despite the numerous progresses made in understanding phase transitions in a variety of contexts , from thermodynamics to classical and quantum field theory @xcite , or complex and biological systems @xcite , and the discovery of their intrinsic universality , a global analytical description of phase transitions for the van der waals gas is still missing . in this work , inspired by the theory of nonlinear pdes , in the class of nonlinear conservation laws , we propose a novel method such that given an equation of state assumed to be accurate outside the critical region allows to construct a partition function for a finite number of particles @xmath0 that is valid in the whole space of thermodynamic variables including the critical region .",
    "this partition function automatically encodes the maxwell equal areas rule .",
    "based on the mean field assumption that configurations of equal volume are equally weighted , we obtain the general functional form of the partition function . for finite @xmath0 ,",
    "the partition function is , as expected , analytic in the space of thermodynamic variables but it develops a singularity in the thermodynamic limit @xmath1 .",
    "we use the laplace method for the asymptotic evaluation of the partition function for large @xmath0 with the constraint that above the critical point , where the laplace integral admits one single critical point , the leading asymptotics of the volume expectation value satisfies the classical van der waals equation .",
    "remarkably , this condition allows to fix uniquely the functional form of the partition function in such a way that the logarithm of the probability density gives the correct gibbs free energy of the van der waals model above the critical point .",
    "finally , we prove that in the critical region , defined as the region in the space of thermodynamic variables where the laplace integral admits multiple critical points , the leading asymptotics for the volume develops a discontinuous behavior , providing the exact analytical description of the first order phase transition .",
    "let us consider a fluid of @xmath0 identical particles of mass @xmath6 , whose centre of mass is fixed at the origin of the reference frame , described by the hamiltonian of the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the momentum of the particles @xmath9 is a two - body interaction potential , and the last term models the interaction with an external field where @xmath10 is a real positive mean field coupling constant and the volume @xmath11 is defined as the minimum convex hull associated to the configuration @xmath12 .",
    "the partition function is given by the standard formula for a canonical ensemble @xmath13 where @xmath14 with @xmath15 the boltzmann constant and @xmath16 the temperature .",
    "let us observe that fixing the centre of mass breaks the translational invariance of the hamiltonian  ( [ hamilt_gen ] ) that otherwise would lead to a divergent partition function @xmath17 .",
    "integration over the moment variables @xmath8 returns @xmath18 where @xmath19.\\ ] ] the rescaled variables @xmath20 and @xmath21 introduced above will allow us to define the thermodynamic limit and the choice of the notation emphasizes the formal analogy between the gibbs free energy and the hamilton - jacobi function of the associated mechanical problem ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "let us introduce the density of free energy @xmath22 this quantity is sometimes also referred to as _ mathematical pressure _",
    ", see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the expectation value of a given observable @xmath23 is defined in the usual manner , i.e. @xmath24 in particular , let us observe that @xmath25 .",
    "the thermodynamic regime is defined as the large particles limit @xmath26 where @xmath27 is avogadro s number . in particular , for @xmath28 moles of a gas of molecules of hard core volume @xmath29 we have @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the gas constant and @xmath32 is the molar hard core volume .",
    "hence , the gas constant @xmath33 defines the typical scale for the variables @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we now assume that for fixed values of the variables @xmath34 and @xmath35 , configurations of equal volume occur with the same probability density , so that there exists a probability measure @xmath36 such that the partition function  ( [ partition ] ) is of the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the total hard core volume .",
    "this assumption gives a nonlinear generalization of the standard mean field approximation introduced for the statistical mechanical derivation of the van der waals equation of state ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "we also note that , from a formal perspective , this ansatz is equivalent to the request that the moments @xmath39 for the model  ( [ hamilt_gen ] ) are such that the measure @xmath36 is the solution to the _ stieltjes moments problem _",
    "@xcite , that is @xmath40 expressing the differential as @xmath41 , the function @xmath42 gives the weight associated to a given volume configuration that , for fixed values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , is the same for all configurations of equal volume .",
    "as for the canonical ensemble the logarithm of the probability density in  ( [ partition ] ) is linear in the variables @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( this ensures entropy maximization at equilibrium ) , we have that the probability density @xmath42 is such that @xmath43 for certain functions @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "hence , the partition function takes the form @xmath46 in the following we will prove that the functions @xmath44 and @xmath45 can be uniquely determined by the request that the expectation value @xmath47 evaluated , away from the critical region , according to the partition function  ( [ part_mom ] ) satisfies , in the thermodynamic limit , the celebrated van der waals equation @xmath48 we should stress that , as discussed in details below , the assumption about the existence of the measure in  ( [ zmeasure ] ) is a strong enough information to fix uniquely the functional form of @xmath49 and @xmath45 with no further specifications on the two - body potential @xmath50 .",
    "however , we find instructive to present an heuristic phenomenological construction for a class of two - body nearest neighbourhood potential depending on the distance of the form @xmath51 , where @xmath52 . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", we can assume that for a given equilibrium configuration particles are on average approximately equidistant , i.e. @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the mean distance , then @xmath55 we used the fact that the number of nearest neighbourhood pairs is of order @xmath0 .",
    "let us consider for example an effective electric potential energy @xmath56 where we observed that the mean distance for a given volume configuration is related to the volume per particle by the relation @xmath57 and the exponent @xmath58 is chosen to ensure the linear extensivity of the potential term in  ( [ hamilt_gen ] ) .",
    "more in general we assume that in the thermodynamic limit we can write @xmath59 that is the potential energy can be expressed as a function of the volume . under this assumption , we observe that the partition function  ( [ partition ] ) can be equivalently written as @xmath60 where @xmath61 gives the number of configurations of the prescribed volume @xmath62 .",
    "a direct comparison with the formula  ( [ part_mom ] ) leads us to the natural interpretation , for large @xmath0 , of the function @xmath45 as the _ configurational entropy _ of the system i.e. @xmath63 let us now proceed by evaluating the leading order asymptotics , for @xmath1 , of the partition function  ( [ part_mom ] ) in the region of thermodynamic variables @xmath34 and @xmath35 where @xmath64 admits one single critical point .",
    "laplace s formula gives @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 is a stationary point for the potential @xmath68 such that @xmath69 , i.e. @xmath70 in particular , formula  ( [ part_laplace ] ) implies that @xmath71 . identifying the external field constant @xmath72 in the hamiltonian  ( [ hamilt_gen ] ) with the physical pressure in eq .",
    "( [ classical_vdw ] ) and choosing    [ matching ] @xmath73    eq .  ( [ g_stat ] ) coincides with the van der waals equation  ( [ classical_vdw ] ) .",
    "we also note that the asymptotic matching condition  ( [ matching2 ] ) allows us to evaluate the function @xmath74 for large @xmath0 that as expected is @xmath75 the prescriptions  ( [ matching ] ) are , according our procedure , the necessary matching conditions that uniquely fix the partition function  ( [ part_mom ] ) consistently with the van der waals equation of state , which is assumed to be accurate above the critical region .",
    "we note that @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the gibbs free energy density of the van der waals model .",
    "a direct calculation shows that the partition function so obtained @xmath78 satisfies the klein - gordon equation in the light - cone variables @xmath79 let us also observe that the integral expression  ( [ partkg ] ) can be explicitly evaluated at finite @xmath0 for @xmath80 and gives @xmath81 that coincides with the equation of state  ( [ classical_vdw ] ) in the limit @xmath82 .    using the self - consistency equation",
    "@xmath83 the klein - gordon equation  ( [ kg ] ) implies that the volume density satisfies the nonlinear viscous conservation law @xmath84 of the type studied in  @xcite and that is related to the viscous analog of the camassa - holm equation . in the thermodynamic limit , above the critical temperature where the gradient of @xmath47 is bounded ,",
    "the term of order @xmath85 in  ( [ vfulleq ] ) is negligible and the volume density satisfies the riemann - hopf type equation @xmath86 whose solution develops a gradient catastrophe in finite `` time '' @xmath35 . as illustrated in fig .  [ fig : g1].a , the volume @xmath47 evolves in the space of thermodynamic parameters just like a nonlinear hyperbolic wave and the gradient catastrophe is associated to the critical point @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 . beyond the critical time @xmath90 ,",
    "the physical solution develops a shock discontinuity , corresponding to a first order phase transition , whose position at fixed @xmath91 is determined by the equal area rule and its speed @xmath92 is given the rankine - hugoniot condition @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the limiting values of @xmath47 respectively to the left and to the right of the jump .",
    "it was observed in  @xcite that the rankine - hugonoit condition is equivalent to the clausius - clapeyron equation implying that the shock speed is proportional to the latent heat associated to the first order phase transition and the trajectory of the shock is interpreted as the coexistence curve of the gas - liquid phase as shown in fig.[fig : g1].b .",
    "such connection between phase transitions and scalar shock waves was first observed in the context of magnetic models ( see e.g.  @xcite and reference therein ) , and in the classical thermodynamic setting in  @xcite where the notion of universality has been also discussed .",
    "it is interesting to compare the mean field partition function  ( [ partkg ] ) associated to the model hamiltonian  ( [ hamilt_gen ] ) and the equation of state obtained according to the standard canonical ensemble formalism . for",
    "the sake of simplicity let us consider an ideal gas of non - interacting particles of hard core volume @xmath96 . in this case",
    "the @xmath97 and the coupling constant @xmath72 models the interaction with the external environment .",
    "we should stress that in the present formalism the gas does not occupy a prescribed volume , but the mean field partition function  ( [ partkg ] ) accounts for all possible gas configurations over the whole space .",
    "evaluating explicitly the formula  ( [ partkg ] ) we obtain @xmath98 the equation of state for the gas of @xmath0 particles is given , in full analogy with the case of mean field spin systems ( see e.g.  @xcite ) via the self - consistency equation @xmath99 or equivalently @xmath100 in the thermodynamic regime @xmath101 we obtain the well known ideal gas equation of state @xmath102 which allows us to identify the coupling constant @xmath72 with the physical pressure that plays the role of the external magnetic field in spin systems . + within the canonical formalism the ideal gas constituted by a fixed number of particles @xmath0 of hamiltonian @xmath103 is assumed to be in equilibrium with an external reservoir and occupy a prescribed volume , say @xmath104 .",
    "the partition function is given by @xmath105 the pressure @xmath106 is then defined in terms of the helmholtz free energy @xmath107 gives the equation of state in the form  ( [ idealeq ] ) .",
    "unlike the canonical formalism the mean field hamiltonian  ( [ hamilt_gen ] ) encodes the boundary condition weighing different volume configurations that are intrinsically defined via the minimum convex hull . as a consequence",
    "the number @xmath0 associated to the spatial scale of the system takes into account of finite size effects , which are important near the criticality , in a consistent manner with the maxwell rule .",
