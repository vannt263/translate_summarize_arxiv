    "deposition of thin films from the vapor phase may lead to amorphous structures . a group of materials which often exhibit non - crystalline structure is various transition metal - metalloid films such as cr - c , zr - si , and fe - b.@xcite interestingly , they are also important components in metallic glasses formed during rapid quenching from a melt , suggesting that the tendency to form amorphous structure is related to inherent properties of the elements and interactions between these elements . to obtain a more detailed understanding of the formation of amorphous structures and glasses we need to develop theoretical methods to model the structure and bonding in these non - crystalline environments .",
    "this can be achieved by e.g. molecular dynamics ( md ) @xcite , monte carlo simulation @xcite , and reverse monte carlo simulation.@xcite unfortunately , these methods suffer from being computationally expensive or to rely on interatomic potentials with sometimes questionable accuracy . in this study",
    "we investigate another approach , namely the stochastic quenching ( sq ) method,@xcite which combines computational efficiency and accuracy in describing the chemical interaction . in this method",
    "the atoms are placed randomly in the calculation cell , and then they are relaxed using first - principles density functional ( dft ) calculations until the force on every atom is negligible .",
    "it has been shown that this way of generating amorphous structures is possible.@xcite however , the present investigation is the first in which a detailed comparison between experiment and the sq theory is made in terms of structural properties , such as bond length and nearest neighbor coordination , in particular for a material with complex chemical interactions .    in this study",
    ", we have selected the zr - si - c system as an amorphous model system , since transition metal carbides and silicides are known to have complex chemistry , with competing metallic and covalent bonds.@xcite we deposit amorphous films using magnetron sputtering from elemental targets and confirm the structure experimentally with several techniques .",
    "the choice of elements is based on several facts .",
    "first , zr is a well - known base element in many metallic glasses .",
    "the atom has a large radius ( 1.59  ) , favorable for amorphous structure formation when combined with several other elements with smaller radii.@xcite second , the zr - si system is well - known to produce amorphous thin films with magnetron sputtering for potential use as e.g. diffusion barriers.@xcite the addition of carbon to a ternary zr - si - c film will create a multicomponent system with different atomic radii favorable for glass formation.@xcite also , in a ternary zr - si - c film a wide variety of bond types are formed ( metallic zr - zr , and covalent zr - c , zr - si and si - c bonds ) , which makes it possible to create a network structure which should further favor an amorphous structure . the potential for applications in zr - si - c",
    "has recently been discussed.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ theo ] , we describe the theoretical methods used in this study , and summarize the most important details of the calculations .",
    "the experimental methods are described in section [ exp ] .",
    "the theoretical and experimental results are presented in section [ res ] .",
    "the amorphous structures were generated in the theory by the stochastic quenching ( sq ) method .",
    "this method is designed to describe amorphous structures in general , although there is less experience with it for complex materials with competing natures of the chemical binding .",
    "the amorphous structures are obtained by means of the following two steps of the sq method : firstly , the atoms are placed randomly in the calculation cell under the constraint that no pair of atoms are closer than a small value ( typically 0.4  ) .",
    "this constraint is required in order to avoid numerical problems in the first few steps in the calculation .",
    "secondly , the positions are relaxed by means of a conjugate gradient method until the force on every atom is negligible .",
    "we found that the self averaging of 150 - 200 atoms usually properly describes the electronic properties at the thermodynamic limit .",
    "@xcite in the present study we used 200 atoms for most of the calculations , and made a few calculations with 400 atoms , for comparison .",
    "the first - principles calculations were performed by means of the projector augmented wave @xcite method as implemented in the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp ) .",
    "this method is based on dft .",
    "@xcite the exchange - correlation energy was calculated using the generalized gradient approximation with the perdew , burke , and ernzerhof functional.@xcite the calculations were considered converged when the potential energy difference between atomic iterations was less than 10@xmath6 ev / atom , and the forces on each atom were typically less than 0.005 ev /  . a plane - wave energy cutoff of 400 ev was employed .",
    "the calculations were performed using only the @xmath7 k - point .",
    "the zr - si - c film was deposited by non - reactive , unbalanced , dc magnetron sputtering in an ultra - high vacuum chamber ( base pressure of 1 * 10@xmath8 pa ) .",
    "separate 2 inch elemental targets ( kurt j. lesker ltd ) with a purity of 99.999% for si and c and 99.2 - 99.7% ( grade 702 ) for zr were used .",
    "the ar plasma was generated at a constant pressure of 0.4 pa with a deposition temperature of approximately 350 @xmath9c and bias of -50 v. all depositions were made using a rotating substrate holder to ensure a homogenous composition .",
    "prior to deposition the si and sio@xmath10 substrates were cleaned using ultrasonic bath in 2-propanol and ethanol for 5 minutes each and dried with nitrogen gas .",
    "the deposition rate was 40 - 70  / min depending on composition and the films for xrd , xps and resistivity analysis was deposited with a thickness of @xmath110.3 @xmath12 m .",
    "the chemical composition was analyzed by xps using a physical systems quantum 2000 spectrometer with monochromatic al @xmath13 radiation and using sensitivity factors determined from binary reference samples of known composition .",
    "the crystallinity of the film was studied using xrd and tem .",
    "the xrd analysis was made using a siemens d5000 diffractometer and cu @xmath13 radiation .",
    "a gracing incidence ( gi ) scan with an incidence angle of 1@xmath9 was used to increase the signal from the thin film in relation to the substrate . for top view",
    "tem the sample was prepared by depositing 40 nm thin film on a nacl substrate .",
    "the nacl was then dissolved in distilled water after deposition releasing the deposited film , which then was put on a carbon - coated copper grid and analyzed using a jeol jem-2100 operated at 200 kv . for the resistivity measurements each sample",
    "was measured six times and mean value and 95% confidence interval was calculated .",
    "the xas measurements were performed at bm26a ( dutch - belgian beamline `` dubble '' ) @xcite of the european synchrotron radiation facility ( esrf ) in grenoble , france .",
    "the incident energy was selected using the @xmath14111@xmath15 reflection from a double si crystal monochromator with bendable 2nd crystal for sagital ( horizontal ) focusing .",
    "vertical focusing and rejection of higher harmonics was achieved with si mirror with pt layer at an angle of 1.8 mrad relative to the incident beam .",
    "the incident x - ray beam had a flux of approximately 1 x 10@xmath16 photons / s on the sample position .",
    "the xas data were measured in fluorescence mode by 9-element monolithic ge detector @xcite at zr k edge ( 17988 ev ) at room temperature .",
    "the zr - si - c thin films on sio@xmath10 substrates were conventionally mounted on a thin tape .",
    "the energy calibration was performed on zr foil .",
    "the data were recorded with a constant 0.05 @xmath17 step in @xmath18-space , in the energy range 17.75 - 18.85 kev .",
    "the intensity was normalised to the incident flux .",
    "the total energy resolution was estimated to be @xmath113.5 ev .",
    "spectra were analysed using the ixafs implementation of ifeffit , athena , and artemis .",
    "@xcite model data were obtained from averages of many calculations of exafs data obtained from local structures present in the description of the amorphous material , using the feff software .",
    "on the experimental side , amorphous structures are typically generated by fast cooling from melts or with quenching of atoms during growth directly from the gas phase .",
    "two films with composition zr@xmath3si@xmath4c@xmath5 and zr@xmath0si@xmath1c@xmath2 ( according to our xps analysis ) were here deposited using magnetron sputtering . in our xrd measurements both films exhibited identical types of structure .",

    "two broad features , one at 36@xmath9 and the other one at 60@xmath9 is observed in the diffractogram .",
    "another small peak is observed at 61@xmath9 for the zr@xmath3si@xmath4c@xmath5 film , which is only a contribution from the si(111 ) substrate .",
    "this type of diffractograms with only broad features is characteristic for an x - ray amorphous material , where these features are a consequence of the close - range order in the material .",
    "[ fig_tem ] shows the tem image of the zr@xmath3si@xmath4c@xmath5 film .",
    "no indication of crystallinity is visible and the film shows a completely amorphous structure . also , the energy filtered electron diffraction ( inset ) shows only broad , featureless rings without indication of any crystalline contribution .",
    "tem and xrd together confirm that both films are amorphous .",
    "the amorphous structures were generated in the theory by the sq method .",

    "@xmath21 in zr@xmath3si@xmath4c@xmath5 is about the same as that in crystalline zrsi@xmath10 ( @xmath27=114.8 gpa @xcite ) , @xmath21 in zr@xmath0si@xmath1c@xmath2 , however , is noticeably lower than that .",
    "@xmath21 of both amorphous materials is smaller than that of crystalline zr@xmath25si@xmath26 ( @xmath28=152 gpa @xcite ) .",
    "as expected , the theoretical @xmath29 of amorphous zr - si - c is significantly smaller than that of the crystalline carbides ( @xmath30=223 gpa , @xmath31=211 gpa ) .",
    "we note that in amorphous materials , in contrast to crystalline materials , not only bond lengths can change upon compression , but also bond angles may vary , even to the extent that atoms may rearrange under compression .",
    "this invariably reduces the curvature of the energy versus volume relationship , when compared to a crystalline material with a reduced bulk modulus as the result .",
    "it is possible that this explains the much lower bulk modulus for amorphous zr@xmath0si@xmath1c@xmath2 ( @xmath21=86 gpa ) when compared to zrc .",
    "the presence of si also changes the bonding situation which may contribute to the relatively low bulk modulus of zr@xmath0si@xmath1c@xmath2 .",
    "it should also be mentioned here that the larger bulk modulus of zr@xmath3si@xmath4c@xmath5 ( @xmath21=116 gpa ) compared to that of zr@xmath0si@xmath1c@xmath2 is somewhat surprising . the compound with more",
    "carbon has a higher density , and is expected to have more of strong si - c bonds , which is expected to increase the bulk modulus , compared to a material with lower c content .",
    "our calculations give the opposite trend . as we show in our study",
    ", the structures generated by the sq method agree very well with observations .",
    "hence it remains to be seen if the calculated trend in bulk modulus is a true effect , or possibly the result of the numerical treatment of the 50 configurations considered at each volume .    in order to compare the structural properties of the theoretical and experimental amorphous phases , in fig .",
    "[ fig_feff31 ] and [ fig_feff60 ] we compare the simulated x - ray absorption fine structure ( exafs at the zr k - edge ) signals of zr@xmath0si@xmath1c@xmath2 and zr@xmath3si@xmath4c@xmath5 to the experimental results .",
    "the simulations of the exafs spectra were performed by means of real space multiple - scattering theory as implemented in the feff code @xcite .",
    "the size of our cells prohibited the use of self - consistent potentials for the multiple scattering calculation of the x - ray absorption coefficients so we distributed overlapping atomic potentials on the sites in our amorphous 200 and 400 atom cells .",
    "the multiple scattering path expansion was used as the full multiple scattering approach loses accuracy at high k - values . in order to simulate periodic boundary conditions , we constructed a 3x3x3 supercell and calculated the normalized exafs signal @xmath32 from each zr atom in the center cell .",
    "the index @xmath33 denotes individual zr atoms , and the index @xmath34 denotes individual 200 atom or 400 atom cells obtained by means of the sq technique .    for each cell @xmath34 , the calculated normalized exafs spectra from each individual zr atom @xmath32 were averaged to form the final @xmath35 .",
    "the theoretical spectra were calculated at 0 k and at room temperature by means of the correlated debye model .",
    "the debye temperature for the amorphous material is unknown , so we estimated a value of 600 k for the calculations that was close to the debye temperatures of zrc ( 614 k - 680 k @xcite ) , zrsi@xmath10 ( 495 k @xcite ) , and zr@xmath25si@xmath26 ( 480 k @xcite )",

    "we find that the overall agreement between the averages of the 50 individual structures ( red lines ) and the experimental signals ( dashed black line ) is good .",

    "the average of the individual structures practically does not change compared to the 200 atom results , which clearly shows that a 200 atom unit cell is sufficient to describe amorphous zr - si - c .    returning to the disagreement between theory and experiment in the region of 6.5 - 7 @xmath17 , for the sample with low zr concentration",
    ", it can be analyzed further by making a fourier transformation of the data in fig .",
    "[ fig_feff31 ] .",
    "this transform ( data not shown ) shows that two bond lengths at distance just above 2.5   are located at 0.2   shorter distances in the theoretical data compared to the experiment .",
    "although this may be viewed as a smaller error to an overall rather satisfactory agreement between experiment and theory , it can most likely be traced back to the very fast quenching of atomic coordinates in the sq method , which is a somewhat slower process in the experimental samples .",
    "this may be realized by noting that for the low zr concentration case , the two peaks for which the sq method makes a 10 % error are associated to the average zr - zr and zr - si bond lengths . in this sample",
    "we expect few nearest neighbor zr - zr coordination , and a reduced amount of zr - si bonds , due to a preferred zr - c bonding in combination with a rather large amount of c in the sample .",
    "however , an inspection of the simulated geometries gives that the sq method does find a finite amount of zr - zr nearest neighbor coordination , due to the rapid quenching .",
    "for the sample with larger zr concentration the amount of c is very low , and hence neither simulations nor experiment can exclude a nearest neighbor zr - zr coordination , resulting in a better agreement between theory and experiment for the exafs data .    to demonstrate that the agreement between theory and experiment is really due to an amorphous structure , we also calculated the exafs spectra of some known crystalline compounds of zr , si , and c ( fig . [ fig_feffcryst ] ) . in this exafs calculation",
    "we used the experimental crystal structures .",
