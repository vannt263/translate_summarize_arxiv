    "form factors ( ffs ) characterize the internal structure of composite particles . since the first measurements @xcite , electromagnetic probes are traditionally preferred to the hadronic beams , because the electromagnetic leptonic interaction is exactly calculable in qed , and one can safely extract the dynamical information about the hadronic vertex . unfortunately , it is not a direct procedure , because , one has to introduce radiative corrections , which may become very large for the unpolarized cross section at large momentum transfer .",
    "radiative corrections for elastic electron - hadron scattering were firstly calculated by schwinger @xcite and are important for any discussion of the experimental determination of the differential cross section .",
    "they are also calculable in qed , within some assumptions concerning the hadronic interaction .",
    "there are standard procedures applied to elastic @xmath0 scattering data , but question may arise if the necessary accuracy has been reached @xcite .",
    "the largest value of momentum transfer squared , @xmath1 , where the electric and magnetic proton ffs @xmath2 and @xmath3 have been extracted from the unpolarized cross section by the rosenbluth method @xcite is @xmath4 gev@xmath5 @xcite and further extraction up to @xmath6 gev@xmath5 @xcite assumes @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the magnetic moment of the proton ) . in order to show the sensitivity of the measurements with respect to @xmath1 , ffs are often normalized to a dipole function : @xmath9/0.71)^{-2}. \\label{eq : dipole}\\ ] ] recently , new developments , due to",
    "the very precise and surprising data obtained at the jefferson laboratory ( jlab ) , in @xmath10 elastic scattering @xcite , based on the polarization transfer method show that the electric and magnetic distributions in the proton are different .",
    "the application of the polarization transfer method , proposed about 30 years ago @xcite , has been possible only recently , as it needs high intensity polarized beams , large solid angle spectrometers and advanced techniques of polarimetry in the gev range .",
    "experiments have been performed at jlab up to @xmath11 gev@xmath5 and an extension up to 9 gev@xmath5 is in preparation @xcite .",
    "the following parametrization for the ratio @xmath12 of the electric and magnetic form factors well describes these experimental data @xcite : @xmath13 - 0.04 ) \\label{eq : brash}\\ ] ] which implies that the ratio monotonically decreases and deviates from unity , as @xmath1 increasing , reaching a value of @xmath14 0.3 at @xmath15 gev@xmath5 .",
    "therefore , a clear discrepancy appears between the @xmath1-dependence of the ratio @xmath12 of the electric to the magnetic proton form factors , whether derived with the standard rosenbluth separation or with the polarization transfer method .",
    "this statement is confirmed by a reanalysis of the existing data @xcite and by recent measurements @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy is very puzzling , as no evident experimental bias has been found in the data or in the method used , and it has been sources of different speculations .",
    "one has to stress , at this point , that the observables are , on one side the differential cross section and on the other side , the polarization transferred to the scattered proton .",
    "the discrepancy is not at the level of the observables : ffs extracted with the polarization method , are not incompatible with the measured cross section : it has been shown that , calcualting @xmath3 from the measured cross section with the constraint on the ratio @xmath12 from polarization measurements , leads to a renormalization of @xmath3 of the order of 2 - 3% only , with respect to the rosenbluth data @xcite , well inside the error bars .    instead , the data are not consistent , if one refers to the slope of the @xmath16 dependence of the reduced cross section , ( @xmath17 is the polarization of the virtual photon , @xmath18^{-1}$],@xmath19 ) which is directly related to @xmath2 .",
    "the difference of such slope especially appears with respect to the last , precise data @xcite .",
    "a possible question arises on the validity of the one - photon mechanism at large @xmath1 , and , generally , on the radiative corrections to the differential cross section and to polarization observables in elastic @xmath0-scattering .",
    "if these corrections are large ( in absolute value ) for the differential cross section @xcite , a simplified estimation of the radiative corrections to polarization phenomena @xcite shows that they are small for the ratio @xmath20 of longitudinal to transverse polarization of the proton emitted in the elastic collision of longitudinally polarized electrons with an unpolarized proton target .    in the standard calculations of the radiative corrections @xcite ,",
    "the two - photon exchange mechanism is only partially taken into account considering the special part of the complicated loop integral , where one virtual photon carries all the momentum transfer and the second virtual photon is almost real .",
    "this contribution allows to overcome the problem of the infrared divergence .",
    "but it has been pointed out @xcite that , at large momentum transfer , the role of another part of the integral , where the momentum transfer is shared between the two photons , can be relatively increased , due to the steep decreasing of the electromagnetic form factors with @xmath1 .",
    "this effect can eventually become so large ( especially at large @xmath1 ) that the traditional description of the electron - hadron interaction in terms of electromagnetic currents ( and electromagnetic form factors ) can become incorrect .",
    "numerous tests of the possible @xmath21 contribution for elastic @xmath22 scattering have been done in the past , using different methods : test of the linearity of the rosenbluth formula for the differential cross section , comparison of the @xmath23 and @xmath24-cross sections , attempts to measure various t - odd polarization observables , but no effect was visible beyond the precision of the experimental data . only recently",
    "the non - zero t - odd asymmetry in the scattering of transversally polarized electrons , @xmath25 has been detected @xcite .",
    "following the arguments of ref .",
    "@xcite , the relative contribution of two - photon exchange , compared to the main ( i.e. , one - photon ) contribution should be visible at smaller @xmath1 for heavier targets : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , because the corresponding form factors decrease faster in comparison with protons as @xmath1 increases",
    ". one would expect to observe the two - photon contribution in @xmath29-scattering at @xmath30 gev@xmath5 , and for @xmath0-scattering at larger momentum transfer , @xmath31 gev@xmath5 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the possible effects of @xmath21-exchange have been estimated from the precise data on the structure function @xmath32 , obtained at jlab in electron deuteron elastic scattering , up to @xmath33 gev@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the possibility of a @xmath21-contribution has not been excluded by this analysis , starting from @xmath34 gev@xmath5 , and the necessity of dedicated experiments was pointed out .",
    "the complete calculation of the @xmath21-contribution to the amplitude of the @xmath35-process requires the knowledge of the matrix element for the double virtual compton scattering , @xmath36 , in a large kinematical region of colliding energy and virtuality of both photons , and can not be done in a model independent form .",
    "however , one can partially reconcile the data , assuming that the radiative corrections contribute to the cross section linearly in @xmath16 @xcite , or in framework of other model - dependent assumptions @xcite .",
    "these attemps give quantitatively different results , but have an effect in decreasing the slope of the differential cross section as a function of @xmath16 .",
    "we previuosly showed @xcite , in a model independent way , that the presence of two - photon exchange destroys the linearity of the rosenbluth fit , inducing a specific dependence of the differential cross section on the variable @xmath16 , which is especially large for @xmath37 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to re - analyse the data about the differential @xmath22 scattering , with respect to the deviation of linearity of the rosenbluth fit .",
    "the two - photon contribution is parametrized according to a simple one parameter form , which satisfies the necessary symmetry properties of the @xmath16 dependence",
    ". a factorisation is assumed for the @xmath1 and @xmath16 dependent terms .",
    "the traditional way to measure electromagnetic proton form factors consists in the measurement of the @xmath16 dependence of the reduced elastic differential cross section @xmath38 , at fixed @xmath1 . assuming that the interaction occurs through the exchange of one photon",
    ", one can write : @xmath39 \\displaystyle\\frac { 1}{\\sigma_{mott}}\\displaystyle\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\omega}=\\tau g_{mp}^2(q^2)+\\epsilon g_{ep}^2(q^2 ) , \\label{eq : sred}\\ ] ] with @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the proton mass , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the incident electron energy and the scattering angle of the outgoing electron , respectively .",
    "the rosenbluth separation @xcite allows to extract the electric and the magnetic form factors , from a linear fit to the reduced cross section , as a function of @xmath16 , at a fixed @xmath1 . the slope is directly related to @xmath2 and the intercept to @xmath3",
    "however , due to the coefficient @xmath44 , the weight of the magnetic contribution becomes larger , as the momentum transfer increases , reducing the sensitivity of the elastic cross section to the electric contribution . as an example",
    ", at @xmath45 gev@xmath5 , the term related to the electric ff contributes for less than 10% to the reduced cross section , assuming the dipole scaling , whereas it would be as low as 2% , if one assumes the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath12 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : brash ] ) .",
    "one can estimate the level of precision required to extract the electric ffs from the experimental cross section at large @xmath1 .    in presence of @xmath21 exchange ,",
    "( [ eq : sred ] ) can be rewritten in the following general form : @xmath46 where @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is a real function ( of both independent variables @xmath1 and @xmath16 ) , describing the effects of the @xmath49 interference .",
    "note that , in the general case , @xmath48 contains two different contributions , one due to the effect of the two - photon contribution on the form factors @xmath50 , and another one due to the third spin structure in the matrix element of @xmath0 scattering , induced by @xmath21 exchange .",
    "both contributions can be calculated only in framework of some model , considering different intermediate states for the @xmath21 box diagrams .",
    "in such situation , any model independent statement concerning the function @xmath48 is important , in particular concerning its @xmath16 dependence , due to the large sensitivity of the extraction of @xmath51 to the additional contribution @xmath48 , at large @xmath1 .",
    "we proved earlier @xcite , that the c - invariance and the crossing symmetry of hadron electromagnetic interaction , result in the following symmetry properties of @xmath48 with respect to the variable @xmath52 : @xmath53 this means that the @xmath54 contribution @xmath48 has an essential non linear @xmath16 dependence , at any @xmath1 .",
    "for example , the additional ( third ) spin structure is generating the following @xmath16-dependence : @xmath55 where the upper index , @xmath56 or @xmath57 , corresponds to the tensor @xcite or axial @xcite parametrization for the third amplitude .    in order to estimate the upper limit for a possible @xmath21 contribution to the differential cross section and the corresponding changing to @xmath58",
