    "therefore @xmath97    let us discuss some consequences of this theorem .",
    "we recall that the model @xmath26 was first introduced in @xcite , as a simplified version ( ` reduced model ' ) of the so - called _ copolymer near a selective interface model _ , cf .",
    "@xcite ( see also  @xcite for a recent overview ) .",
    "it is known that the copolymer model undergoes a localization / delocalization phase transition .",
    "an interesting object is the _",
    "critical line _ separating the two phases , in particular in the limit of weak coupling constants , where it becomes a straight line with positive slope @xmath98 .    a lot of effort has been put in finding the exact value of @xmath98 .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that @xmath98 appears to be a _",
    "universal _ quantity : it is independent of the law of the environment ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  3 ) and it determines the phase transition of a continuous copolymer model , arising as the scaling limit of the discrete one @xcite .",
    "what is known up to now is that @xmath99 .",
    "notice that @xmath100 and @xmath101 are exactly the bounds that were previously known for @xmath102 , and this is not by chance : indeed the definition of the model @xmath26 is inspired by the strategy behind the proof of @xmath103 , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the reason for introducing a reduced model is to have a more tractable model , which would possibly have the same behavior as the full copolymer model in the limit of weak coupling constants , i.e. for which possibly @xmath104 .",
    "however , the numerical results obtained in @xcite provide strong indications for the fact that @xmath105 .",
    "if this is indeed the case , our result shows that the reduced model does not catch the full complexity of the copolymer model , i.e. the ` missing free energy ' should come from a different strategy than the one which is at the basis of the lower bound @xmath103 .    by theorem",
    "[ th : main ] , our model provides also a non - trivial example of a linear chain pinning model where , for large @xmath13 , the quenched critical point @xmath51 is different from the annealed one @xmath106 ( see the proof of lemma  [ lem : ub ] ) .",
    "what we actually prove in this paper is a stronger version of theorem  [ th : main ] , i.e. theorem  [ th : main2 ] , stated in the next section .",
    "the proof relies on _ quenched _",
    "arguments , based on a rigorous _ renormalization procedure _ ( somewhat in the spirit of  @xcite ) .",
    "the idea is to remove from the environment sequence @xmath19 the positive charges that are well - spaced ( that therefore give no sensible contribution to the partition function ) and to cluster together the positive charges that are very close .",
    "this procedure produces a new environment sequence @xmath107 , which has fewer charges but of stronger intensity .",
    "the key point is that replacing @xmath19 by @xmath107 in the partition function yields an upper bound on the free energy .",
    "then , by iterating this transformation , we obtain environment sequences for which the free energy can be estimated and shown to be arbitrarily small .",
    "a detailed description of this approach , together with the organization of the paper , is given in section  [ sec : strategy ] .",
    "we point out that theorem  [ th : main ] has recently been obtained by fabio toninelli @xcite with a simpler ( though more indirect ) argument , avoiding the renormalization procedure we apply .",
    "we however believe that our direct procedure , eliminating ` bad ' regions in a recursive way , is also of value for other problems , e.g. for proving that @xmath108 .",
    "theorem  [ th : main ] can actually be extended to a broader class of models .",
    "namely , let @xmath109 be a renewal process , i.e. @xmath110 and @xmath111 under @xmath112 are i.i.d .",
    "random variables taking positive values ( including @xmath113 ) .",
    "it is convenient to look at @xmath114 also as the ( random ) subset @xmath115 of @xmath116 , so that expressions like @xmath117 make sense .",
    "we assume that @xmath114 is _ terminating _ ,",
    "i.e. @xmath118 that it is _ aperiodic _ , i.e. @xmath119 , and that for some positive constant @xmath120 we have : @xmath121 we introduce @xmath122 , that gives the number of renewal epochs up to  @xmath8 , and the renewal function @xmath123 associated to @xmath114 , defined for @xmath124 by @xmath125 by and , the asymptotic behavior of @xmath126 is ( * ? ? ? * th .",
    "a.4 ) @xmath127 so that in particular there exists a positive constant @xmath128 such that @xmath129 we stress that @xmath126 has the same polynomial behavior as @xmath130 : this is a consequence of equation and is a crucial fact for us .",
    "keeping the same environment @xmath131 as in , we define the new partition function @xmath132 and we call @xmath133 the corresponding free energy : @xmath134 then we have the following extension of theorem  [ th : main ] .",
    "[ th : main2 ] for every @xmath92 there exists @xmath93 such that @xmath135    let us show that theorem  [ th : main ] can easily be deduced from theorem  [ th : main2 ] . to this purpose , we choose @xmath136 to be the renewal process with inter - arrival law @xmath137 defined in .",
    "notice that @xmath114 is not aperiodic , but this is a minor point ( it suffices to focus on the even sites to recover aperiodicity ) , and that @xmath137 satisfies and ( restricted to even sites ) .",
    "then we can write the original partition function as @xmath138 this formula looks slightly different from .",
    "first , there is a pre - factor , due to the fact that @xmath137 is defined under the _ restricted law _ @xmath139 while @xmath27 is defined as an average with respect to the _ conditioned law _",
    "@xmath10 . we have already noted that @xmath40 , therefore this pre - factor is irrelevant for the purpose of computing the free energy .",
    "the second difference is the presence in of the indicator function @xmath140 , but again this _ boundary condition _ does not change the laplace asymptotic behavior , as is shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "therefore @xmath133 defined by coincides with @xmath141 defined by , and theorem  [ th : main ] follows from theorem  [ th : main2 ] .",
    "another natural extension is to let the renewal process @xmath136 have inter - arrival distribution @xmath142 such that @xmath143 with @xmath144 and @xmath145 a _ slowly varying function _",

    "we stick to the case @xmath149 and @xmath150 , for ease of notations , but we stress that our proof of theorem  [ th : main2 ] goes through for the general case with easy modifications , provided one replaces @xmath100 by @xmath151 in the statement of theorem  [ th : main2 ] .",
    "lemma  [ lem : lb ] also generalizes immediately , again with @xmath100 replaced by @xmath151 , hence we have @xmath152 with @xmath153 . in particular , for large @xmath13",

    "in this section , we explain the strategy behind the proof of theorem  [ th : main2 ] in details , and describe the organization of the paper . before doing that , we introduce some notations , and make some preliminary transformations of the partition function @xmath155 .",
    "let us first introduce some notations to be used throughout the paper .",
    "given an arbitrary sequence @xmath156 , the sequence @xmath157 , is defined as follows : @xmath158 in our case , @xmath19 is the sequence of charges , and @xmath159 are the locations of the positive charges .",

    ". therefore we look at @xmath19 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 as equivalent ways of describing the sequence of charges .",
    "we also mention an elementary fact that will be used in the next section : the sequence @xmath170 is i.i.d . if and only if the variables @xmath171 are all independent , the @xmath172 are i.i.d .",
