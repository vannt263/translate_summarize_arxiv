    "+ our results are important for future space missions to jupiter system that carry a dust detector onboard .",
    "this study can be further applied to estimate the dust counts into a dust detector in orbit around europa and/or ganymede .",
    "a dust detector has been proposed as part of a payload for a space mission to europa and ganymede .",

    "if a dust detector is included in the payload , an in - situ analysis of the dust that surrounds europa and ganymede will be possible , which could provide information about the surface , as its composition should be `` written '' in the detected dust @xcite .",

    "the galileo nims ( near infra - red mapping spectrometer ) spectra identified these impurities as hydrated minerals , sulphates and possibly hydrocarbons @xcite . as the surface material is ejected by micrometeoroid bombardment , it can be expected that the dust particles around europa will be composed of water ice , sulphur salts and their decomposition products , including any potential organic compounds @xcite .",

    "we primarily focus on the short - lived , bound ejecta at a distance from the surface at which a spacecraft may orbit .",
    "therefore , any asymmetry effects in the spatial density of ejected fragments caused by europa s orbital motion can be excluded ( such were considered by @xcite ) as well as the charging of dust fragments .",

    "+ in our models the largest ejecta fragment was taken to be 1% of the total ejecta mass , @xmath110 , in an impact event . if that value was 0.01% @xmath110 or 10% @xmath110 , the dust density would increase or decrease , respectively , by a factor of 5 .",
    "if the ejecta fragmentation slope @xmath72 changes for @xmath11120% , the dust density would also change by a factor of 5 , moving the distribution more towards larger or smaller fragments , depending upon the slope value .",
    "+ the input parameter that has the greatest effect on the model outcome is the strength of the surface material , which is mainly ice . the strength of ice can vary significantly ( it depends on temperature , grain size and porosity ) from less than 0.3 mpa ( corresponding to snow , which is the value used in our model ) , to 3 mpa for non - porous crystalline ice @xcite and up to 10 mpa if the ice contains a fraction of non - ice , silica - like , material @xcite . if the strength is varied between 0.01 and 10 mpa , this would create an order of magnitude ( 10 times ) lower or higher dust density in the dust cloud , respectively .",
    "the strength of the surface material on europa and ganymede could also vary locally , which is another reason why it is important to emphasize the strength as the most dominant input parameter .",
    "the actual density measurements and chemical analysis of dust in the clouds around europa and ganymede by a dust detector in orbit would also help narrow down the surface material strength .",
    "in this paper , we present an update model for determining the size and spatial density of dust around europa and ganymede at any altitude within the moons hill sphere , with particular emphasis on the role of micrometeoroid impacts ejecting surface material .",
    "the model computes influx distributions from different sources and addresses each ejected fragment individually according to its size and corresponding speed , allowing the complete profile of the dust around europa and ganymede to be defined through calculation of the size , velocity and spatial distribution of the complete outflux .",
    "+ an important feature of this dust model is the ability to predict the dust around europa for distances closer to the surface than any of the spacecraft flybys made so far as well as for the dust populations below the galileo dds detection threshold . we have verified these results by comparing our results with data collected by the galileo dds .",
    "it is found that the dust spatial densities close to the surface of europa and ganymede should be much higher than a simple extrapolation from the actual galileo data .",
    "there should also be much more dust at sizes below the galileo dds detection threshold .",
    "+ this model can be applied to any other atmosphereless body in the solar system , but above all , it is of great importance for future orbiter missions around europa and ganymede , such as recently selected juice mission , esa s next large space mission , to jupiter system .",
    "this study provides scientific support for a dust detector / analyser payload for juice or any other future space mission to europa and/or ganymede .",
    "it also complements surface studies traditionally performed using remote sensing instruments .",
    "km thanks astrium ( eads / uk ) for co - funding her doctoral studies , and we thank the anonymous referees for useful comments that helped improve this manuscript .",
