    "solitons scattering from obstructions have been studied numerically ( _ eg _ @xcite ) and have shown interesting dynamics . as we have seen in our previous study of soliton scattering that each model has its on dynamical features .",
    "however , all models have as observed numerically mutual dynamics . in all models investigated",
    "so far solitons have elastic scattering on barriers and inelastic scattering on holes .",
    "furthermore , the scattering on barriers have revealed that the core of solitons is not important and the dynamics in this case resembles the scattering of a featureless point particle .",
    "therefore , results obtained from the dynamics on barriers can be worked out analytically . on the contrary ,",
    "the scattering on holes have shown some challenging dynamics .",
    "solitons in all models investigated loses some their energy which makes the analytical description of such behaviour more complicated .",
    "mo , solitons have shown quantum -like behaviour as observed in many studies and this makes the behaviour quite hard to be understood within a classical theory .    in this paper",
    ", we will try to shed some light on the dynamics of various soliton - obstruction systems from analytical perspective and compare the analytical results with the ones observed in numerical simulations . to approach the dynamics of the soliton - obstruction systems we will use collective coordinates , _ ie _ the parameters of the field solution .",
    "we will , for simplicity , approximate the solitonic solution by only one parameter which represents the position of soliton .",
    "hence , the soliton solution can be approximated as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the position of soliton .",
    "soliton field has an infinite degrees of freedom and so a more reliable approximation would be if we allow the kink of the soilton to vary at the obstruction , _ ie _ @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the parameter that describes the variation of the kink at the obstruction .",
    "so , far away from the obstruction at @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "but , the resulting dynamics is more complicated to handle .",
    "thus , we will consider only an approximated field with one parameter that describes the position of the soliton .    in following sections we will study three different soliton - obstruction systems in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions and show how much our approximations are valid .",
    "we will consider lagrangian densities for which a soliton solution can be obtained . a lagrangian density that describes soliton - obstruction systems is given by    @xmath7    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the kinetic and the potential terms respectively .",
    "the obstruction is introduced to the lagrangian density via a coupling in the potential term .",
    "the obstruction is confined in a certain region of space and it is seen by a soliton as an external potential hole or a barrier .    where @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the obstruction is localised in a finite region of space and are either square wells or square barriers .",
    "so , in what follows , we will write @xmath12 .",
    "thus we can describe them using heaviside functions which are defined by :    @xmath13    therefore the potential can be written as :    @xmath14,\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 is the position of the obstruction and @xmath16 is the parameter that describes the magnitude ( _ ie _ height or depth ) of the obstruction . a study that has been conducted in this",
    "regard for sine - gordon model in @xcite , has considered the obstruction as a one point perturbation . in our study",
    "we will over look the dynamics that span the space for which the obstruction is localised .",
    "the sign of @xmath16 determines whether the potential obstruction is a hole or a barrier . when @xmath17 , the obstruction is a barrier and a hole when @xmath18 . in the following sections we will analyse various soliton - obstruction systems that would shed a light on the dynamics of such systems .",
    "so , we need to calculate the lagrangian which is given by    @xmath19\\right)\\,v\\left(x\\right)\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ % & & = \\int^{\\infty}_{-\\infty}dx\\left(t - v\\right)-\\lambda_{0}\\int^{\\infty}_{-\\infty}\\,d\\,x\\left[h\\left(x+x_{0}\\right)-\\,h\\left(x - x_{0}\\right)\\right]v\\left(x\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & & = \\int^{\\infty}_{-\\infty}dx\\left(t - v\\right)-\\lambda_{0}\\int^{x_{0}}_{-x_{0}}dxv\\left(x\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the following sections we will build an approximate field solutions for various soliton - obstruction systems and give analytical description for the dynamics of these models and compare our analytical description with the numerical simulation work that have been explained in the previous papers @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian density for the @xmath0 model is given by    @xmath20    we use the ansatz    @xmath21,\\ ] ]    where @xmath22 is the position of soliton as a function of time .",

    "4 show the force exerted by the obstruction on a soliton for @xmath26 when the obstruction is inserted in the space region , @xmath27 .",
    "this is in agreement with the observed behaviour . in case of a barrier",
    "the force for the first half of the barrier is repulsive but it becomes attractive for the second half . in the hole it is the other way around .    ,",

    "4 decays out exponentially as we move away from the obstruction and increases , in magnitude , exponentially at the edges of the obstruction .",
    "then it dies out exponentially when the soliton is inside the hole or at the top of the barrier .",
    "thus , when the soliton is far away from obstruction , _ @xmath36 _ , @xmath37 , the force is zero and so    @xmath38    the solution is    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the initial position of soliton .    we have solved the equation of motion ( [ eommod1 ] ) with initial conditions that specify the values of the position @xmath41 of the soliton and its speed using fourth order runge kutta method .",
    "fig . 5 and fig . 6",
    "show the trajectories of the soliton starting from an initial position , @xmath42 .",
    "these trajectories describe a soliton moving with a speed of 0.5 and interacting with a barrier of height @xmath16=0.25 and a hole of depth -0.25 .",
    "the figures demonstrate the validity of our approximation .",
    "we have found such agreement between our analytical approach and the numerical simulations in many occasions .",
    "we can calculate the total energy of soliton .",

    "@xmath45 , the total energy is the mass of soliton :    @xmath46    this is , in fact , the minimum energy of the soliton _ i.e _ @xmath47 .    therefore ,    @xmath48    in order to find mass of soliton at the top of a barrier or inside a hole with @xmath45 we need to position the soliton where the force of the barrier or a hole on the soliton is minimum .",
    "the best position is when @xmath49 since the force is zero .",
    "however , one needs to keep in mind that a soliton is not a point particle but an extended structure where there will be always an interaction between the tail of the soliton and the tail of the force on both ends . at @xmath49 ,",
    "the total energy which is the mass of a soliton at the obstruction is given by    @xmath50    table 1 and table 2 show the numerically and calculated masses of soliton at various @xmath16 when @xmath51 for various barrier heights and hole depths .",
    ".the calculated and observed masses of a soliton at the top of barriers , @xmath52 [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the critical velocity can be calculated using ( 114 ) @xmath53    for a barrier height of @xmath54 , the critical velocity , according to the above equation , for the q - ball solution with @xmath55 is @xmath56 which is the same as the numerical value @xcite .",
    "we analysed the dynamics of some the soliton - obstruction systems that we have studied via numerical simulations .",
    "we were able to demonstrate that our approximated models were successfully able to explain most of the observed behaviour of solitons scattering off potential obstructions .",
    "we have approached the dynamics of such systems in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions by using collective coordinates , _ ie _ parameters of the theory . in the case of topological solitons , @xmath0 model and deformed sine - gordon model of class i potentials ,",
    "the position of soliton is the only parameter that has been used to approximate their models .",
    "more than one parameter can be used to approximate such models but this will result in further analytical complications . in the case of q - ball in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions",
    "two parameters were at least needed to explain the dynamics namely : the position of the q - ball and the phase which is latter identified as the angular frequency of the q - ball . our analytical work was able to explain the observed rest masses in barriers and holes and to produce trajectories that matches the ones produced by simulations to a great extent and to find out the forces between the solitons and potential obstructions .",
    "the forces and the potentials exerted on the solitons due to the obstructions were plotted for each model .",
    "further work can be done on building better approximated models which we will leave it for the future .",
