    "the recent extension @xcite of the theory of monotone dynamical systems to monotone input - output ( i / o ) systems has proven to be very useful in analyzing the global behavior of many important dynamics ; see for example @xcite , and see section [ sec2 ] below for the relevant definitions .",
    "( see also @xcite for a detailed account of monotone dynamical systems . ) of particular interest in this literature are feedback interconnections of subsystems  or `` modules''that are monotone and that possess a unique globally asymptotically stable equilibrium , obviously depending on the particular ( constant ) input applied .",
    "this has lead to the introduction of the notion of _ input - state ( i / s ) characteristics _ , which are maps assigning to each constant input value the particular equilibrium point to which solutions converge . in many applications ,",
    "this assignment is exactly the type of quantitative information that is available from experiments ( such as gene expression levels , for instance ) .",
    "monotonicity , on the other hand , may be considered as a qualitative or structural property of an i / o system ; see the graphical tests for monotonicity in @xcite for example .",
    "these two ingredients , monotonicity of the subsystems and existence of characteristics , are key to proving the small - gain theorems in @xcite .",
    "( for small - gain theorems for nonlinear but not necessarily monotone systems , see @xcite . )    in practice however , many monotone i / o systems subject to constant inputs possess _",
    "several _ equilibria and all solutions converge to one of them , although distinct solutions may converge to distinct equilibria .",
    "such systems are sometimes called _ multi - stable_. in fact , since monotone i / o systems subject to constant inputs are monotone dynamical systems , this type of global behavior is to be expected ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the notion of an i / s characteristic ought to be generalized to a _ multi - valued _ map which assigns to each constant input value the set of all possible equilibria to which solutions converge .",
    "this naturally leads to the question of whether the known small - gain theorem for monotone systems in @xcite remains valid if instead of the original notion of i / s characteristics , one assumes the existence of multi - valued characteristics for the subsystems .",
    "the purpose of our paper is to show that such an extension is indeed possible . in our main result",
    ", we prove that a negative feedback interconnection of monotone i / o subsystems with multi - valued characteristics is itself multi - stable , provided that all the solutions of a particular discrete - time inclusion ( which is typically of much lower dimension than the subsystems ) converge .",
    "our work provides a significant extension of the angeli - sontag monotone control systems theory @xcite because @xcite requires singleton - valued characteristics and therefore globally asymptotically stable equilibria . for other approaches to proving multi - stability ,",
    "see @xcite ( where _ positive _ feedback interconnections of monotone i / o subsystems are considered and the trajectories converge for _ almost all _ initial values ) and @xcite ( which is based on density functions and also concludes convergence for almost all initial values ) .",
    "this earlier work does not include ours because for example ( a ) our results provide global stabilization from all initial values , ( b ) we do not require any regularity such as singleton - valuedness , differentiability , or non - degeneracy for the i / s characteristics , and ( c ) our results are intrinsic in the sense that we make no use of lyapunov or density functions .",
    "this note is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we provide the necessary definitions and background for monotone control systems , multi - valued characteristics , weakly non - decreasing set - valued maps , and asymptotically autonomous systems . in section [ sec3 ]",
    ", we state our small - gain theorem and discuss its relationship to the small - gain theorems in @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec4 ] , we prove our theorem and we illustrate our theorem in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "we close in section [ sec6 ] with some suggestions for future research .",
    "we next provide the relevant definitions for monotone control systems and input - state characteristics . while our monotonicity definitions follow @xcite , our treatment of characteristics is novel because we allow discontinuous multi - valued characteristics and unstable equilibria .",
    "our general setting is that of an input - output ( i / o ) system @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the closure of its interior and partially ordered , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are subsets of partially ordered euclidean spaces @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are locally lipschitz on some open set @xmath8 containing @xmath9 .",
    "we refer to @xmath9 as the _ state space _ of ( [ dyn ] ) , @xmath2 as its _ input space _ , and @xmath3 as its _",
    "output space_. in general , @xmath9 will not be a linear space , since for example we often take @xmath10 .",
    "we use @xmath11 to denote the partial orders on all our spaces , bearing in mind that the partial orders on our various spaces could differ .",
    "the set of _ control functions _ ( also called _ inputs _ ) for ( [ dyn ] ) , which we denote by @xmath12 , consists of all locally essentially bounded lebesgue measurable functions @xmath13 , and we let @xmath14 denote the trajectory of ( [ dyn ] ) for any given initial value @xmath15 and @xmath16 . we always assume our dynamics @xmath6 are _ forward complete _ and _ @xmath17-invariant _ , which means that @xmath18 is defined on @xmath19 and valued in @xmath9 for all @xmath15 and @xmath16 . since we will be considering more than one dynamic , we often use sub- or superscripts to emphasize the state space variable or dynamic , so for example @xmath20 is the flow map for the dynamic @xmath6 and @xmath21 is the output space for an i / o system with state variable @xmath22 .",
    "we always assume that our partial orders @xmath11 are induced by distinguished closed nonempty sets @xmath23 ( called _ ordering cones _ ) and we sometimes write @xmath24 to indicate the cone inducing the partial order on the input space @xmath2 and similarly for the other partial orders .",

    "we will not use the static lyapunov stability property in the proof of our small - gain theorem _ per se _ , but we still include it to make our definition of i / s characteristics include the singleton - valued characteristic definition in @xcite .",

    "_ remark :  _ condition @xmath100 , and in particular the `` no cycles '' part , may be hard to check in practice , at least if the system dimension is higher than @xmath101 , but can often be checked using monotonicity arguments .",

    "it is therefore natural to inquire about whether set - valued i / s characteristics posses some analogous ( but more general ) order - preserving property .",

    "these periodic sequences are caused by the fact that the slope of the middle line segment of the graph of @xmath88 is @xmath170 .",
    "any slight decrease of this slope will destroy the periodic points and leads to solutions that converge to one of the fixed points .",
    "for example , for arbitrary @xmath180 we can define @xmath181 as the map whose graph consists of three straight line segments connecting @xmath182 to @xmath168 , @xmath168 to @xmath183 ( so the slope of this line segment is @xmath184 ) , and @xmath185 to @xmath186 .",
    "then every solution of the inclusion @xmath187 will converge to one of the three fixed points of @xmath88 .",
    "in fact , each solution sequence of this inclusion converges to either @xmath165 or @xmath163 , except for the constant sequence at the middle fixed point @xmath188 . to see why , notice that if @xmath189 , then @xmath190 remains on the segment @xmath191 , so @xmath192 by the argument for the singleton - valued case .",
    "similarly , if @xmath193 , then @xmath190 remains on @xmath194 so @xmath195 again by the singleton - valued case ; while if @xmath196 stays in @xmath197 $ ] , then @xmath198 for all @xmath199 . then either @xmath200 , or else @xmath201 as @xmath202 which is impossible",

    "we will then obtain information about the trajectories for not - necessarily constant inputs using the theory of asymptotically autonomous systems . before turning to this theory , first recall the following `` converging - input converging - state '' ( cics ) property .",
    "this property was shown in @xcite and was used in @xcite to study the stability of interconnected monotone systems .",

    "the proof of the cics property in @xcite uses the fact that @xmath42 is open , which follows from the assumption that @xmath44 is a _",
    "stable _ equilibrium .",
    "however , in our more general setting where the i / s characteristics are multi - valued , the domains of attraction will not necessarily be open , so the cics property does not apply . instead",
    ", we prove our result using the theory of asymptotically autonomous systems developed by thieme in @xcite . to this end",

    "setting @xmath310 and @xmath311 and recalling that @xmath239 reverses order gives @xmath312 since we are assuming @xmath131 is singleton - valued , the proof of ( * ? ? ?",

    "letting @xmath333 in ( [ odd ] ) gives @xmath335 .",
    "thus , @xmath336 applying lemma [ t92lemma ] to the @xmath22-subsystem @xmath337 and the input @xmath338 shows that @xmath339 for some @xmath340 .",
    "since @xmath304 is continuous , @xmath341 converges as well ; i.e. , @xmath342 .",
    "therefore , @xmath343 and ( [ key2 ] ) gives @xmath344 .",
    "it follows that @xmath345 , so @xmath346 .",
    "therefore , our theorem will follow once we show that @xmath264 converges to some point in @xmath347 as @xmath152 . to this end ,",
    "first note that @xmath348 as @xmath47 as a consequence of the cics property[cicsuse ] ( namely lemma [ cics ] above ) applied to the @xmath220-subsystem @xmath349 and the input @xmath350 , because we are assuming that @xmath131 is singleton - valued .",
    "since @xmath351 , this completes the proof of the theorem .",
    "[ svis ] one can extend our theorem to cases where @xmath131 and @xmath240 are _ both _ multi - valued .",
    "for example , our theorem remains true if we replace its assumption 3 by :    * _ the respective i / s characteristics @xmath131 and @xmath240 exist and are locally bounded_.    in this case the conclusion of the theorem is that our interconnection ( [ intercon ] ) has the pointwise globally attractive set @xmath352 .",
    "the proof of this alternative formulation is similar to the proof we gave above and proceeds by a repeated application of @xmath353 condition ( [ antimon2 ] ) follows because @xmath354 is monotone and @xmath131 is weakly non - decreasing .",
    "we leave the details of the proof of this more general version of our theorem to the reader .",
    "we next illustrate our theorem using the interconnection @xmath355 evolving on @xmath356 , where @xmath357 .",
    "we order @xmath220 and @xmath22 by the usual cone @xmath19 .",
    "this dynamic satisfies conditions 1 - 2 from theorem [ sgt ] . replacing @xmath239 with @xmath358 in ( [ interconex ] ) gives the planar positive feedback system @xmath359 if we use superscripts o to label the characteristics of our original interconnection ( [ interconex ] ) , and if we use @xmath131 and so on to denote the characteristics of ( [ ex ] ) , then @xmath360 and @xmath361 .",
    "also , if @xmath362 with @xmath363 for all @xmath199 , then @xmath250 for all @xmath199 when the @xmath153 s are chosen to satisfy @xmath364 for all @xmath155 .",
    "moreover , since the output @xmath239 in ( [ interconex ] ) is always positive , @xmath365 , so @xmath363 for all @xmath366 along all solution sequences @xmath367 of @xmath368 . therefore , if each solution sequence @xmath249 for @xmath250 converges , then each solution sequence @xmath367 for @xmath362 converges as well , which implies the required convergence of solutions of @xmath369 by remark [ assum4 ] .",
    "the fact that condition 3 will also hold for the original interconnection ( [ interconex ] ) will then follow because ( [ interconex ] ) has the same trajectories as ( [ ex ] ) .",
    "it therefore remains to show that ( [ ex ] ) satisfies condition 3 from our theorem , that all its trajectories are bounded , and that each solution of @xmath250 converges . to this end , first note that since the outputs of both subsystems in ( [ ex ] ) are also their states , i / s and i / o characteristics coincide for ( [ ex])-if they exist ",
    "so we can define @xmath370 wherever the characteristics exist .",
    "the characteristic of the first subsystem in ( [ ex ] ) is the singleton - valued function @xmath371 while the characteristic for the second subsystem is multi - valued and only determined implicitly as follows : @xmath372 for @xmath373 .",
    "a bifurcation analysis of the scalar system @xmath374 , treating @xmath373 as a bifurcation parameter , shows that @xmath375 is a characteristic which is    1 .",

    "double - valued if @xmath379 or @xmath380 : @xmath381    there are two saddle - node bifurcations , one at @xmath379 and the other at @xmath382 .",
    "the four defining properties of a characteristic ( see definition @xmath229 ) can indeed be readily verified : for each @xmath373 , the system @xmath374 has a finite number of isolated compact equilibria and no cycles ( since the system is scalar ) , and every solution converges to one of the equilibria .",
    "it is also not hard to see that @xmath383 is locally bounded . in order to apply theorem [ sgt",
    "] , we only need to verify that ( [ ex ] ) satisfies condition @xmath100 of our theorem .    to check",
    "that the trajectories of ( [ ex ] ) ( or equivalently of ( [ interconex ] ) ) are bounded , it suffices to verify the following : _ claim ( g ) : if @xmath264 is any trajectory of ( [ interconex ] ) defined on some interval @xmath384 $ ] , then there is a compact set @xmath186 depending only on @xmath385 ( and not on @xmath386 ) such that @xmath387 for all @xmath388 $ ] .",
    "_ boundedness will follow from @xmath389 by standard results for extendability of solutions of ode s . to prove @xmath389 , first note that the boundedness of @xmath239 on @xmath384 $ ] and the variations of parameters formula gives @xmath390 for all @xmath391 $ ] .",
    "pick @xmath392 such that @xmath393 which exists because @xmath394 is one - to - one above @xmath395 .",
    "it follows that if @xmath396 is such that @xmath397 , then @xmath398 so @xmath399 .",
    "therefore , @xmath273 stays below @xmath400 on @xmath384 $ ] .",
    "since @xmath400 depends only on @xmath401 , claim ( g ) follows .",
    "next consider the discrete inclusion @xmath402 and notice that it reduces to a discrete equation @xmath403 because @xmath404 and @xmath375 is single - valued when @xmath405 .",
    "notice also that for all @xmath406 , the discrete equation gives @xmath407 for all @xmath408 . in particular , the interval",
    "@xmath409 is forward invariant for the discrete equation .",
    "finally , since @xmath410 is decreasing for @xmath411 , elementary calculus shows that @xmath412 so @xmath413 is a contraction mapping on @xmath414 , hence the discrete equation has a unique globally attractive fixed point @xmath415 .",
    "therefore , we know from remark [ assum4 ] that ( [ ex ] ) satisfies conditions 3 - 4 of our theorem , as claimed .",
    "since @xmath416 we conclude that our original interconnection ( [ interconex ] ) has the unique globally attractive equilibrium @xmath417 figure [ graph ] below illustrates this .    , @xmath375 and @xmath418 from section [ sec5].,width=364,height=336 ]    [ multiequil ] in the preceding example , the inclusion @xmath250 had a unique equilibrium , but our theory applies to examples where @xmath419 has more than one element as well .",
    "one such example is constructed by modifying the interconnection ( [ ex ] ) in the following way : replace the @xmath220-subsystem with @xmath420 where @xmath421 consists of the line segments in the @xmath422-plane joining @xmath423 to @xmath424 , @xmath425 to @xmath426 , and @xmath426 to @xmath427 . with this change",
    "we get @xmath428 , and the conclusion of our theorem remains true because @xmath248 converges for each solution sequence @xmath249 of @xmath250 ; see remark [ assum4 ] .",

    "the detailed analysis of this more complicated example is similar to the analysis of ( [ ex ] ) and is left to the reader .",
    "note that the convergence of the iterations in the preceding remark follows because @xmath418 is a horizontal line , at least locally where it meets the other characteristic .",
    "we presented a new small - gain theorem for interconnections of monotone i / o systems with set - valued i / s characteristics .",
    "this corresponds to situations where the trajectory for a given constant input can converge to several possible equilibria , depending on the initial value for the trajectory .",
