    "@xmath1 scuti stars ( hereinafter , @xmath1 sct stars ) are pulsating variables inside the classical instability strip and on or close to the main - sequence",
    ". they are typically placed at the lower on the instability strip than rr lyrae stars or cepheids and thus they are fainter than rr lyrae stars or cepheids .",
    "their spectral types are between a and late f. their periods are between @xmath20.02 days and @xmath20.25 days , which is relatively shorter than other types of variables ( e.g. @xmath3 dor ; @xcite ) . based on these characteristics , @xmath1 sct stars can be separated from other types of variable stars such as rr lyrae , @xmath4 cepheid , @xmath3 dor etc @xcite .",
    "the majority of the @xmath1 sct stars are low - amplitude @xmath1 sct stars ( lads ) with amplitudes from a milli - magnitude to a few tens of milli - magnitude .",
    "lads are mainly non - radial p - mode pulsators @xcite .",
    "another subgroup of @xmath1 sct stars is the high - amplitude @xmath1 sct stars ( hads ) , whose amplitudes are bigger than @xmath20.3 magnitude . hads are radial pulsators @xcite .",
    "in addition to lads and hads , there is another interesting type pulsation star called sx phe variable stars , which exhibit a type of pulsation similar to the @xmath1 sct stars .",
    "they are relatively old and evolved population ii stars , whereas most of the @xmath1 sct stars are population i stars .",
    "stellar evolutionary theory is not yet successful at explaining these sx phe variable stars @xcite .",
    "most of the sx phe show similar properties with hads such as high amplitude and short period .",
    "more detailed review of @xmath1 sct stars is presented in @xcite @xcite and references therein .",
    "because of their great number of radial and non - radial modes , it is known that @xmath1 sct stars are suitable for asteroseismology research , which enables study of stellar interior structures @xcite . for a better understanding of pulsating @xmath1 sct stars and",
    "thus stellar structure , several authors studied @xmath1 sct stars and detected their multiple frequencies of pulsation using either ground - based observations or space - based observations @xcite . due to",
    "the better photometric precision , space - based observations data show better results on the analysis of multiple frequencies than ground - based observation data @xcite . however , some authors have pointed out that ground - based observations using multiple - site telescopes are still valuable because , with a baseline longer than space - based observations , they are useful for detecting long - period pulsation ( for more details , see @xcite and references therein ) . moreover , by parameterizing the amplitude ratio and the phase differences in different filters ( e.g. @xmath5 ) , it is possible to derive the spherical harmonic degree , @xmath6 @xcite , which is an important parameter for the asteroseismology studies .",
    "therefore ground - based telescopes that are more feasible for multiple - site and multiple - filter observations ( e.g. delta scuti network , @xcite ) are nonetheless useful for the identification of pulsation modes and thus for the study of interior structures .",
    "another interesting feature of @xmath1 sct stars is that some of them show period and amplitude variations @xcite .",
    "the period variation ( 1/p ) dp / dt , based on observations , is about 10@xmath7 per year for both period increases and decreases with equal distribution . on the other hand ,",
    "theoretical models give ten times smaller period variation than observed ; they also predict that period increases should be dominant over period decreases @xcite .",
    "amplitude variations and time scales of the variations are different from star to star , ranging from a few milli - magnitudes to several tens of milli - magintudes and from a few tens of days to a few hundreds of days @xcite . these period and amplitude variations",
    "are thought to be caused not by evolutionary effects but by some other mechanism ( e.g. light - time effect because of the orbital motion in binaries or nonlinear mode interactions ) .",
    "however , the true origin of the variations is still unknown . for more details , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "@xcite investigated hads in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and their period - luminosity (",
    "p - l ) relation to test if they can be used as the standard distance candles .",
    "they found that the distance modulus for lmc derived using @xmath1 sct stars is consistent with the distance moduli for lmc derived using rr lyrae and cepheids , which implies the p - l relation of @xmath1 sct stars can help to determine distances of _ long - distance _ objects such as objects in the lmc .    in this paper , we present the detection of 41 @xmath1 sct candidate stars from the taiwan - american occultation survey ( taos ) data accumulated during 2005 and 2006 observation ( hereinafter , taos @xmath1 sct stars ) . among the 41 detections ,",
    "there is one previously known ` suspected variable ' star , nsv 3816 , from the suspected variable stars and supplement @xcite ( no period or type is provided in that catalog ) .",
    "the rest of the 40 taos @xmath1 sct stars are newly detected by this study .",
    "only 14 of the detected taos @xmath1 sct stars have spectral types .",
    "twelve of those have spectral types from a to f , which are typical for @xmath1 sct stars .",
    "the remaining two have b8 and g5 spectral types , which are peculiar spectral types .",
    "using spectroscopic instruments -boes @xcite and fast @xcite- , we obtained spectra for those two stars . as a result we found that the b8 star is an a5 star and",
    "the g5 star is an f0 star .",
    "even though the rest of the detected stars do not have spectral type information , their low amplitudes , short periods and morphologies of light - curves strongly suggest that they are lads .    in section [ sec : taos_delta_scuti ] , we present a taos overview , data reduction processes and the detection algorithm we used to detect @xmath1 sct stars in taos 2-year data .",
    "we provide a list of the detected taos @xmath1 sct stars and their physical parameters ( e.g. magnitude , period , amplitude , spectral type , etc ) in section [ sec : detectionresults ] . in section [ sec : conclusion ] , we present summaries .",
    "taos aims to detect stellar occultations caused by small - sized kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) at a distance of neptune s orbit or beyond @xcite . because of the short duration ( @xmath8 sec ) and the rareness of occultation events , taos monitors several hundreds of stars in a wide field of view ( 3 deg@xmath9 ) with a high sampling rate . to reduce false positives , taos uses four @xmath10 cm telescopes which simultaneously monitor the same patch of the sky . due to the high sampling rate ,",
    "taos data is also useful for detecting short - period variable stars such as @xmath1 sct stars .",
    "moreover , taos telescopes keep monitoring the same field up to 1.5 hours and can thus obtain full - phase light - curves of variable stars whose periods are shorter than 1.5 hours .",
    "to detect such short - period variable stars , we analyzed taos data accumulated during 2005 and 2006 .",
    "the dataset consists of 117 taos observation fields , which cover 351 @xmath11 of the sky .",
    "it consists of @xmath2200 _ runs _ , where a run is a set of multiple ( two or three ) telescope observations for a given field and a given date .",
    "note that the taos telescopes occasionally visit the same observation field multiple times according to the telescopes observation schedules , which enables detecting the same variable stars multiple times . in such case",
    ", we are able to derive multiple frequencies of the stars as explained in section [ sec : listdeltascuti ] .      to detect periodic signals , we analyzed the light - curves generated by the taos photometry pipeline @xcite .",
    "the pipeline was developed by the collaboration to extract light - curves of each star from _",
    "zipper images_. the _ zipper images _ are generated by the unique telescope operation mode called _ zipper mode _ which was developed in order to achieve high - speed photometry @xcite .    after obtaining the light - curves using the taos photometry pipeline , we applied further cuts to the light - curves .",
    "some of the individual measurements are flagged as invalid .",
    "this happens when the star moves out of the field of view because of temporary telescope vibrations or tracking error , thus yielding no photometrical measurements .",
    "we therefore applied a b - spline @xcite and replaced the flagged measurements with values interpolated from the spline fit .",
    "after the interpolation process , in order to increase the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , we binned each light - curve using a 50 point window ( 10 sec ) . during the binning process",
    ", we used the average time of the 50 data points as the time of the binned data .",
    "we then removed the systematic variations that are common across light - curves of the same run .",
    "such systematic variations , which we call _ trends _ , could be caused by airmass , temporary telescope vibrations , noise in ccd images , etc .",
    "to remove such trends , we applied the photometric detrending algorithm ( pdt , @xcite ) to each individual run .",
    "pdt first calculates the correlation between whole light - curves as a measure of similarity between light - curves .",
    "pdt then uses the hierarchical clustering algorithm @xcite to group similar light - curves together and determines one _ master - trend _ per group by summing weighted light - curves in the group . using the determined master - trends",
    ", pdt finally removes trends from each individual light - curve by minimizing the residual between the master - trends and the light - curve . for more details about pdt ,",
    "see @xcite .    figure [ fig : lc_example ] shows an example of a taos @xmath1 sct star s light - curve before and after detrending process .",
    "x - axis is time in minutes and y - axis is flux . as the figure shows , periodic signals are clearly recovered after detrending .",
    "we show the errors for each photometric measurement before detrending , propagated from the errors estimated by the taos photometry pipeline @xcite .",
    "x - axis is time in minutes and y - axis is flux .",
    "the top panel is the light - curve before detrending and the bottom panel is the light - curve after detrending .",
    "the periodic signals contaminated by unstable weather ( e.g. moving clouds ) are successfully recovered after detrending .",
    "we show the errors for each photometric measurement of the raw light - curve.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]      after we finished the preprocessing , explained in the previous section , we applied the fast fourier transform algorithm ( fft ; @xcite ) to each light - curve in order to detect periodic signals .",
    "note that the individual measurements of taos light - curves are evenly spaced with a 5hz sampling rate .",
    "thus fft is appropriate for the detection of periodic signals .",
    "we focused on the detection of short - period variable stars whose periods are @xmath12 hour because taos monitors a given field for a maximum of 1.5 hours .",
    "we describe the basic steps of the detection process below :    * we apply fft to each detrended light - curve and derive the power spectrum of the light - curve .",
    "[ item : fft1 ] we then examine if there exists a frequency ( or frequencies ) whose power is bigger than five times the standard deviation of powers of the background frequencies .",
    "the standard deviation of powers is calculated after removing outliers using 3-sigma clipping .",
    "we identify the star as a variable candidate if there is a frequency higher than five times the standard deviation .",
    "[ item : fft2 ] * for each candidate variable we check if the periodic signal is detected on the other telescopes light - curves of the same run .",
    "if it is not detected by the other telescopes , we remove the star from the candidate list .",
    "[ item : fft5 ] * we visually inspect all raw zipper images for the candidates and remove false positives caused by moving asteroids , photometry defects or other contamination due to various noise sources . for instance",
    ", the flux of stars in the neighborhood of fast moving objects could be increased and decreased within an hour , which resembles periodic signals .",
    "[ item : fft6 ] * we cross - match all of the candidates with simbad @xcite and remove the false positives that are confirmed to be other types of variable stars ( e.g. eclipsing binary stars ) . *",
    "finally we remove the variable stars whose periods are longer than 1.5 hours .",
    "with the detection algorithm described in the previous section , we found 41 @xmath1 sct candidate stars whose periods are shorter than 1.5 hours and whose amplitudes are within a few hundredth of a magnitude ( hereinafter , taos @xmath1 sct stars ) . among those 41 taos @xmath1 sct stars ,",
    "one of them is a previously _ suspected _ variable star , nsv 3816 , from the suspected variable stars and supplement @xcite .",
    "however , the period and amplitude of nsv 3816 have never been published before .",
    "the remaining 40 taos @xmath1 sct stars are newly detected by this study .",
    "after the taos @xmath1 sct stars were identified , we extracted the physical parameters of each star by cross - matching them with various astronomical catalogs .",
    "we show catalogs we used in table [ tab : catalogs_parameters ] .",
    "we found that 12 of the detected 41 taos @xmath1 sct stars have spectral types from a0 to f5 , which are typical spectral types for @xmath1 sct stars .",
    "unfortunately the rest of them , except for two peculiar @xmath1 sct stars -discuss in section [ sec : spectroscopy]- , do not have spectral information .",

    "moreover , the taos telescopes occasionally visit same fields multiple times . in such cases ,",
    "we merge all corresponding normalized light - curves of each identified @xmath1 sct star into a single but longer light - curve . having longer light - curves we were able to extract multiple frequencies using period04 . among the extracted frequencies",

    "the snr of each frequency was calculated using period04 as well .",
    "@xcite , we empirically found that a threshold of snr @xmath18 4 produces false positives and thus we set the snr threshold to five . ] as a result we found 16 taos @xmath1 sct stars having multiple frequencies ( see table [ tab : delta_scuti ] ) .",
    "note that we did not attempt to extract multiple frequencies if the star is detected only once ( i.e. detected in only single zipper run ) .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that we lose detectability on relatively long period pulsations because we normalized the light - curves while merging them .",
    "all detected @xmath1 sct stars are relatively bright as shown in the table ( the faintest star s @xmath19 is around 12 ) .",
    "this is because the limiting magnitude of taos _ zipper mode _ is relatively bright at @xmath213.5 @xcite and also because high snr is needed to detect low - amplitude variations of a few milli - magnitude . to find @xmath19 , @xmath20 and spectral types , we used centre de donnees astronomiques de strasbourg ( cds ) web service @xcite .    in table",
    "[ tab : delta_scuti ] , we also provide the number of the total observations ( i.e. the number of the total zipper runs ) and the number of identifications by the fft analysis for each taos @xmath1 sct star .",

    "note that we applied the fft algorithm to each light - curve to detect periodic signals .",
    "nevertheless , as the table shows , not every light - curve of the taos @xmath1 sct stars were confirmed to have periodic signals .",
    "this is mainly because of the poor quality of some of the light - curves caused by trends and noise ( i.e. unstable weather , telescope vibration , etc ) .",
    "although we removed most of the trends using pdt , it is nearly impossible to recover the intrinsic periodic signal of a few milli - magnitude in the presence of large systematic errors .      in figure",
    "[ fig : nyquist_sw ] we show an example of a spectral window of a single zipper run . since the observational times are almost equally spaced , peaks with regular intervals ( two times the nyquist frequency ) are present in the spectral window @xcite .",
    "the nyquist frequency is 4320hz since the gap between each consecutive binned data is 10 sec .",
    "figure [ fig : worst_ps ] , [ fig : inter_ps ] and [ fig : best_ps ] show the spectral windows along with the power spectra of three taos @xmath1 sct stars .",
    "stars included in the figures are 020.00141 ( figure [ fig : worst_ps ] ) , 121.00043 ( figure [ fig : inter_ps ] ) and 054.00014 ( figure [ fig : best_ps ] ) .",
    "the top panels in each figure show the spectral windows and the bottom panels ( and the middle panel in figure [ fig : best_ps ] ) show the power spectra of the stars .",
    "dashed lines indicate the detected frequencies .",
    "note that we improved the detected frequencies by fitting a combination of sine waves using period04 .",
    "thus the improved frequencies could be slightly shifted from the original peaks in the power spectra ( e.g. see the bottom left panel in figure [ fig : worst_ps ] ) after the fitting .    as table [ tab : delta_scuti ] shows , the star with i d 020.00141 was identified only once and is relatively fainter ( @xmath21 11.40 ) than other taos @xmath1 sct stars .",
    "its amplitude is one of the smallest amplitudes and its detected frequency snr is the lowest among taos @xmath1 sct stars .",

    "the spectrum also shows weak metallic lines ( e.g. ca and mg line ) which are usually presented in a type stars . based on the strength of ca k line , hydrogen lines and metallic lines ,",
    "the star is likely an a5 type star although the classification of sub - class is rather uncertain due to the low snr of the spectrum .",
