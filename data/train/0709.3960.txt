    "ngc  4945 is a nearby , almost edge - on ( @xmath10 ) , disk galaxy ( type sb(s)cd or sab(s)cd ) that is a member of the centaurus group of galaxies @xcite .",
    "its distance , determined most accurately from the luminosity of stars at the tip of the red giant branch , is 3.82@xmath110.31  mpc @xcite .",
    "this value is consistent with previous more cruder estimates of the distance to ngc  4945 ( see the discussion in bergman et al .",
    "1992 ) , and so henceforth we shall assume that 1  corresponds to 19  pc in ngc  4945 .",
    "the central region of ngc  4945 contains an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) revealed most unambiguously by its strong and variable hard x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "megamaser emission has been detected from the nucleus , likely distributed in a disk with radius of @xmath515  mas ( @xmath50.3  pc ) around the agn ( greenhill et al .",
    "the agn is classified as a seyfert 2 @xcite , consistent with findings that seyfert  2 but not seyfert  1 galaxies exhibit water megamasers ( e.g. , review by * ? ? ?",
    "surrounding the agn , there is an inclined circumnuclear starburst ring with a radius of @xmath525 ( @xmath550 pc ) seen most clearly in pa@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the central region of ngc  4945 is among the strongest and most prolific extragalactic sources of molecular lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for these reasons , ngc  4945 is a particularly attractive candidate for studying the nature of molecular gas at the center of an active galaxy , and the role this gas plays in fueling and perhaps also determining in part the observed properties of both the circumnuclear starburst and agn .    because of its southerly declination ( @xmath14 )",
    ", studies of the molecular gas in ngc  4945 have been largely restricted to single - dish telescopes , in particular the 15-m swedish - eso submillimeter telescope ( sest ) .",
    "@xcite made the first map of the central region of this galaxy in the @xmath15 transition of @xmath1co at angular resolution of 43  ( measured at full - width to half - maximum , fwhm , henceforth used throughout when quoting sizes ) .",
    "they attributed the observed strong central concentration of molecular gas to a disk with a radius of @xmath518  ( 340  pc ) . with just a single pointing at the nucleus",
    ", @xcite obtained high - quality spectra of both @xmath1co and @xmath2co in the @xmath15 transition .",
    "they found that the observed line ratio as a function of velocity can be modeled as a homogenous ring in rigid - body rotation with an inner radius of @xmath58  ( @xmath5150  pc ) and an outer radius of @xmath515  ( @xmath5280  pc ) .",
    "@xcite mapped the central region of ngc  4945 in both the @xmath15 and @xmath0 transitions of @xmath1co at an angular resolution of 43  and 24  respectively .",
    "based on the measured position - velocity diagram along the major axis of ngc  4945 in both transitions , they inferred the presence of a ring with a radius of 8@xmath113  ( @xmath5150  pc ) in the @xmath0 and 15@xmath113  ( @xmath5280  pc ) in the @xmath15 transitions .",
    "they noted that this did not necessarily suggest the presence of two rings , but rather a radial variation in the excitation conditions and/or optical depth in a single ring with a given radial thickness .",
    "@xcite mapped the central region of ngc  4945 in the @xmath16 transition of @xmath1co at an angular resolution of 15 . in this transition",
    ", they found an intrinsic size for the central concentration of radius @xmath17 ( @xmath5100  pc ) along its major axis .",
    "although the position - velocity diagram is once again consistent with a ring but with an even smaller radius than in lower @xmath1co transitions , @xcite were careful to point out that other structures ( e.g. , disk , bar , spiral , or even two independent molecular concentrations ) are possible .",
    "all the abovementioned single - dish observations infer the presence of a molecular ring with size smaller than the respective angular resolutions of these observations .",
    "it is not clear how this molecular ring is related to the starburst ring , whether it comprises the reservoir for fueling the active nucleus , and whether it is related to the hypothetical circumnuclear molecular torus required by agn unification models @xcite .",
    "observations at higher angular resolutions are needed to spatially resolve and hence clarify the spatial - kinematic distribution of the molecular gas at the center of ngc  4945 .",
    "the first such observations were made quite recently by @xcite , who used the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) to map a central region of radius 17  ( 323  pc ) in the @xmath15 transitions of hcn , hco@xmath18 , and hnc at an angular resolution of @xmath19 ( @xmath20  pc ) .",
    "these lines trace molecular gas at about an order of magnitude higher density ( @xmath5@xmath21 ) than the abovementioned @xmath1co lines ( @xmath5@xmath22 ) .",
    "the hnc map , which best traces the overall spatial - kinematic distribution of the molecular gas , reveals an inclined rotating disk - like feature with a radius of @xmath23 ( @xmath580  pc ) along the major axis and position angle of @xmath24 , somewhat misaligned from the major axis of both the starburst ring and large - scale galactic disk at a position angle of @xmath5@xmath25 . based on the measured position - velocity diagram , @xcite argue that the hnc line traces a ring with an inner radius of 3  ( 57  pc ) .",
    "their maps , however , are affected by a lack of short baselines that result in an inability to detect structures larger than @xmath515  ( @xmath5285  pc ) .",
    "furthermore , line absorption against the strong central continuum source at their observing wavelength of 3.3  mm ( 90  ghz ) may compromise the detectability of the innermost features .",
    "here , we present the first interferometric observations of the central region of ngc  4945 in @xmath1co , as well as in @xmath2co and c@xmath3o , at their @xmath26 transitions .",
    "the angular resolution attained is much higher than previous single - dish co observations , and we properly resolve for the first time the central molecular gas concentration in co lines .",
    "our maps recover virtually all the emission detected in single - dish observations , and are not affected by line absorption against the central continuum source .",
    "we show that the co gas is distributed in an inclined disk exhibiting rigid - body rotation out to a radius of @xmath55  ( @xmath595  pc ) ; i.e. , the molecular disk extends beyond the circumnuclear starburst ring seen in pa@xmath13 .",
    "the rotation curve flattens beyond this radius , and the isovelocity contours exhibit an s - shaped asymmetry suggestive of a highly inclined bar as has been invoked to produce a similar asymmetry in both molecular and atomic hydrogen gas extending to much larger radii .",
    "we do not detect any central hole in the disk , placing an upper limit of 22 ( 42  pc ) on the radius of any such hole .",
    "instead , we detect for the first time a spatially - unresolved component at the center of the disk that is kinematically decoupled from the surrounding disk .",
    "this inner component exhibits a broad velocity width comparable with the overall range in velocities exhibited by the surrounding disk , and is a good candidate for the hypothesized circumnuclear molecular torus invoked by agn unification models @xcite .",
    "we observed ngc  4945 with the submillimeter array ( sma ; * ? ? ? * ) , located on mauna kea in hawaii , on 2004 may 22 and 24 .",
    "to achieve the most circular beam possible , we used the compact configuration of the array that is elongated in the north - south direction tailored for southern hemisphere sources .",
    "over the course of the observations , this array configuration provided projected baselines ranging from about 6  m to 74  m. seven of the eight antennas of the array were in operation at the time of our observations .",
    "each of the sma antennas has a diameter of 6  m , and at our observing wavelength of 1.3  mm ( frequency of 230  ghz ) a corresponding fwhm primary beam of 52  ( i.e. , field of view of nearly 1  kpc ) .",
    "the array was pointed toward the center of ngc  4945 as defined by the position of h@xmath12o megamasers at right ascension @xmath27 and declination @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "we observed the @xmath1co , @xmath2co , and c@xmath3o lines in their @xmath0 transitions simultaneously by placing the @xmath1co line in the upper sideband ( usb ) and the @xmath2co and c@xmath3o lines in the lower sideband ( lsb ) of the double - sideband receivers .",
    "the correlator was configured to provide a total bandwidth of 2  ghz in each sideband using twenty - four independent spectral windows ( `` chunks '' ) .",
    "each window is divided into 128 channels with a channel width of 0.8125 mhz ( i.e. , @xmath51.1 km / s ) , giving a total frequency coverage in each sideband ( with a small overlap between windows at their edges ) of 1.9 ghz ( i.e. , @xmath52570  km / s ) .",
    "because of its low declination , ngc  4945 is visible for only @xmath52  hrs each day from the sma , and never exceeds an elevation of @xmath5@xmath29 . although the weather was good ( zenith opacity @xmath30 ) on both days of our observations , because of its low elevation the sky opacity towards the source was relatively high resulting in system temperatures of 400  k to 600  k ( single sideband ) . on each day , we observed ngc  4945 for a total on - source integration time of 53  mins .",
    "we used two quasars for complex gain ( i.e. , amplitude and phase ) calibration .",
    "the stronger quasar @xmath31 , which lies at a larger angular separation of @xmath5@xmath32 from ngc  4945 , was used for amplitude calibration .",
    "the weaker quasar @xmath33 , which lies at a smaller angular separation of @xmath5@xmath34 from ngc  4945 , was used for phase calibration .",
    "the flux density of the amplitude calibrator @xmath31 was scaled from observations of callisto .",
    "the quasar 3c279 was observed for bandpass calibration .",
    "we calibrated the data in the standard fashion using the software package mir - idl , and made images using aips .",
    "the results shown in this paper correspond to the data taken on may 24 only .",
    "data taken on may 22 , at a different sidereal time , have a different @xmath35-coverage ( greater number of longer projected baselines ) and deep negative sidelobes that made imaging of the line emission difficult . to make a map of the continuum emission",
    ", we used the line - free channels ( total bandwidth of 3  ghz ) in both the lsb and usb . to make maps in line emission , we first used the line - free channels in the visibility plane to derive the continuum emission , which was then subtracted from all the channels .",
    "the synthesized beam achieved with natural weighting of the visibilities is @xmath36 ( @xmath5@xmath37  pc ) at a position angle of @xmath38 .",
    "in figure  [ continuum ] , we show a map of the 1.3-mm continuum emission superposed on a pa@xmath13 image of the central region of ngc  4945 taken from @xcite . the continuum source has a total flux density of @xmath39  jy , and is clearly resolved .",
    "gaussian fitting yields a deconvolved size ( at fwhm ) of @xmath40 @xmath41 ( @xmath42  pc ) with the major axis at a position angle ( pa ) of @xmath43 .",
    "the centroid of this source is located at @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which is 18 to the south - east of the nominal centroid of the h@xmath12o megamasers @xcite .",
    "the latter coincides within measurement uncertainties with the centroid of the central radio continuum source detected at cm - wavelengths @xcite , and presumably marks the location of the agn .",
    "the major axis of the 1.3-mm continuum source is not aligned with the major axis of either the starburst ring or larger - scale galactic disk , both of which have a @xmath46 . along the major axis of the pa@xmath13 starburst ring",
    ", the 1.3-mm continuum extends beyond the inner bright rim of the starburst ring at a radius of @xmath525 ( @xmath550  pc ) , and also beyond the detectable outer radius of this ring at @xmath55  ( @xmath5100  pc ) . on the south - eastern side of the ring",
    ", the 1.3-mm continuum clearly extends beyond the measured extent of the pa@xmath13 emission .",
    "the central region of ngc  4945 has been imaged in the continuum at centimeter wavelengths at angular resolutions comparable with that attained here . at 21  cm ( 1.4  ghz )",
    ", the source has a deconvolved size of @xmath47 @xmath48 with major axis at @xmath49 , and a total flux density of @xmath50  jy @xcite . at 5  cm ( 6  ghz )",
    ", the source has a smaller deconvolved size of @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) at @xmath53 , and a total flux density of @xmath54  jy @xcite .",
    "the size of the continuum source at centimeter wavelengths is therefore much smaller than that measured at 1.3  mm .",
    "instead , the centimeter continuum source has a size comparable with the starburst ring , and its major axis is aligned with that of the starburst ring .",
    "the steep negative spectral index of this source indicates that nonthermal ( synchrotron ) emission dominates at centimeter wavelengths , and presumably arises from star - formation - related activity ( e.g. , supernovae ) in the starburst ring ( in addition to any unresolved emission from the agn ) .",
    "@xcite have imaged the central continuum source at 3.3  mm ( 90  ghz ) at an angular resolution comparable with that attained here . like us",
    ", they find an elongated source whose centroid is offset to the south - east of the h@xmath12o megamasers , and whose major axis is at @xmath55 . with a reported deconvolved source size of @xmath56 and peak flux density of 0.13  jy ,",
    "the corresponding total flux density for a gaussian source is @xmath51.0  jy . extrapolating from 21  cm and 5  cm , the expected flux density at 3.5  mm is @xmath50.5  jy , only half that actually measured . extrapolating to 1.3  mm , the estimated contribution from nonthermal emission is @xmath50.3  jy , less than one quarter the flux density measured at this wavelength .",
    "even if we assume that nonthermal emission dominates at 3.3  mm , this emission would only contribute at most about half the total flux density measured at 1.3  mm .",
    "thus , we conclude that dust emission dominates at 1.3  mm ( and also contributes significantly at 3.3  mm ) , and that this explains the different dimensions and position angles of the source at millimeter and centimeter wavelengths . in @xmath57 , we discuss the implications of these results for the origin of the central far - ir emission from ngc  4945 .      to estimate the mass of molecular gas from the inferred dust emission at 1.3  mm ( assuming a gas to dust ratio of 100 ) , we first subtract the estimated cotribution from nonthermal emission ( @xmath50.3  jy ) from the total continuum emission ( @xmath51.3  jy ) .",
    "the gas mass is then given by + @xmath58 d[{\\rm mpc}]^2 \\lambda[{\\rm mm}]^2 } { t_d[{\\rm k } ] \\kappa_d(\\nu)[{\\rm \\ g^{-1 } \\",

    "assuming a dust temperature @xmath63 as inferred from far - infrared measurements @xcite , we find that @xmath64  m@xmath65 .",
    "if we adopt a dust temperature corresponding to the peak brightness temperature measured in @xmath1co(2 - 1 ) of @xmath530  k (  [ subsec : lineemission ] ) , the gas mass is then @xmath66  m@xmath65 . as we shall show in @xmath67[co - mass ] , the gas mass inferred from dust is comparable with values inferred from the three observed co lines .        like the continuum emission , the @xmath1co(2 - 1 ) , @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) , and c@xmath3o(2 - 1 )",
    "lines are strongly concentrated towards the center of ngc  4945 .",
    "figures  [ 12channel ] and [ 13channel ] show channel maps of the @xmath1co(2 - 1 ) and @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) emission smoothed to a velocity resolution of @xmath5@xmath68 , with the circumnuclear starburst ring seen in pa@xmath13 plotted as an ellipse . in figure  [ mom0 + 1-maps ] , we show the corresponding total intensity ( moment 0 ) as well as intensity - weighted mean - velocity ( moment 1 ) maps .",
    "an inspection of these maps reveals that the molecular emission originates ( primarily ) from a highly - inclined rotating disk extending beyond the pa@xmath13 starburst ring .",
    "gaussian fitting to the moment maps yields a deconvolved size ( at fwhm ) for the disk of @xmath69 ( @xmath52 ) ( @xmath5@xmath70  pc ) and major axis at pa@xmath71 in @xmath1co(2 - 1 ) , a size of @xmath72 ( @xmath52 ) ( @xmath5@xmath73  pc ) and pa@xmath74 in @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) , and a size of @xmath75 ( @xmath52 ) ( @xmath5@xmath76  pc ) and pa@xmath77 in c@xmath3o(2 - 1 ) .",
    "the derived position angle of the major axis in the more optically thin @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) and c@xmath3o(2 - 1 ) lines is in good agreement with the position angle along which the velocity gradient of the disk reaches a maximum in these lines .",
    "the major axis of the disk ( mean @xmath78 ) is therefore well aligned with that of the starburst ring as well as the larger - scale galactic disk at a position angle of @xmath5@xmath25 .",
    "we see no evidence for the central hole in our data , suggesting that any central hole in this disk has a size smaller than the synthesized beam , which measures 44 along the major axis of the disk .    in all three molecular lines ,",
    "the inner region of the disk within a radius of @xmath55  ( @xmath595  pc ) appears to exhibit simple circular rotation with the isovelocity contours perpendicular to major axis of the disk as can be seen in figure  [ mom0 + 1-maps ] . beyond this radius ,",
    "however , the disk exhibits significant deviations from circular rotation as can be best seen in @xmath1co(2 - 1 ) . here , the isovelocity contours on the north - eastern side of the disk twist to the north , and on the south - western side twist to the south , producing a s - shaped asymmetry . in this outer region ,",
    "the spatial structure of the disk closely resembles the distribution of the 1.3-mm continuum emission ( e.g. , the south - east extension ) , reinforcing our earlier argument that the continuum emission at 1.3  mm is likely dominated by dust .    the position - velocity ( pv- )",
    "diagrams of all three molecular lines along the inferred major axis of the disk are shown in figure  [ pv - diagrams ] .",
    "the pv - diagrams along the major axis in @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) and c@xmath3o(2 - 1 ) indicate ( primarily ) rigid - body rotation , while in @xmath1co(2 - 1 ) it shows additional complex emission with a broad velocity width at or near disk center .",
    "cuts along different position angles reveal that this `` excess '' emission is always present as a ( vertical ) strip in velocity at the origin of the pv - diagram , not just in @xmath1co(2 - 1 ) but also in @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) and c@xmath3o(2 - 1 ) .",
    "for example , in figure  [ pv - diagrams ] we also show the pv - diagrams along the minor axis of the disk ( @xmath79 ) , as well as halfway between the major and minor axes of the disk ( @xmath80 ) , in all three molecular lines .",
    "armed with this knowledge , a closer inspection reveals that this feature can just be seen in the pv - diagrams along the minor axis of the disk in @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) and c@xmath3o(2 - 1 ) .",
    "this feature therefore corresponds to a kinematically - decoupled component with a size smaller than the synthesized beam ( i.e. , projected radius as small as 14 or 27  pc ) located at the center of the disk . in the channel maps",
    ", this kinematically - decoupled feature appears as the ever - present emission towards the center of the disk even at the most blueshifted and redshifted velocities detectable .",
    "by contrast , in an inclined disk exhibiting only rigid - body rotation , the most blueshifted and redshifted velocities should originate from just the outermost regions of the disk along its major axis .",
    "we infer from both the channel maps and pv - diagrams a systemic velocity of @xmath5@xmath6 measured with respect to the local standard of rest .",
    "( all velocities quoted here are relative to the local standard of rest , which is @xmath81 lower than the heliocentric velocity . ) by contrast , single - dish observations in @xmath1co(1 - 0 ) and @xmath1co(2 - 1 ) infer a significantly lower systemic velocity of @xmath5@xmath82 @xcite .",
    "the hnc observation of @xcite indicate a systemic velocity , as measured at the midpoint between the two strongest hnc peaks in the pv - diagram ( their fig .",
    "11 ) , of @xmath5@xmath83 , about halfway between single - dish and our interferometric co measurements .",
    "the systemic velocity inferred from interferometric observations in atomic hydrogen ( hi ) gas @xcite , averaged over the entire galaxy , is @xmath84 , in agreement with the abovementioned value derived from single - dish co measurements . on the other hand ,",
    "hi detected in absorption towards the centroid of the central continuum source has a velocity of @xmath5@xmath6 ( see fig .  5 of * ?",
    "* ) , similar to the systemic velocity inferred here .",
    "arcsecond imaging of hydrogen recombination lines near 8.6  ghz @xcite shows that the emission peaks at the location of the central radio continuum source ; these recombination lines have a systemic velocity of @xmath5@xmath85 , again close to that inferred here .",
    "we therefore conclude , based on observations that better trace gas closer to the center of the galaxy , that the systemic velocity of ngc  4945 is more likely about @xmath6 .      the @xmath1co(2 - 1 ) emission towards the center of ngc  4945 has been observed a number of times with the sest @xcite .",
    "these observations often give different line profiles and intensities , caused most likely by inaccuracies in telescope pointing .",

    "<S> we have mapped the central region of ngc  4945 in the @xmath0 transition of @xmath1co , @xmath2co , and c@xmath3o , as well as the continuum at 1.3  mm , at an angular resolution of @xmath4 with the submillimeter array . </S>",
    "<S> the relative proximity of ngc  4945 ( distance of only 3.8  mpc ) permits a detailed study of the circumnuclear molecular gas and dust in a galaxy exhibiting both an agn ( classified as a seyfert  2 ) and a circumnuclear starburst in an inclined ring with radius @xmath525 ( @xmath550  pc ) . </S>",
    "<S> we infer the systemic velocity @xmath5@xmath6 from channel maps and pv - diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> we find that all three molecular lines trace an inclined rotating disk with major axis aligned with that of the starburst ring and large - scale galactic disk , and which exhibits solid - body rotation within a radius of @xmath55  ( @xmath595  pc ) . </S>",
    "<S> the rotation curve flattens beyond this radius , and the isovelocity contours exhibit an s - shaped asymmetry suggestive of a highly inclined bar as has been invoked to produce a similar asymmetry observed on larger scales . </S>",
    "<S> we infer an inclination for the nuclear disk of @xmath7 , somewhat smaller than the inclination of the large - scale galactic disk of @xmath5@xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the continuum emission at 1.3  mm also extends beyond the starburst ring , and is dominated by thermal emission from dust . </S>",
    "<S> if it traces the same dust emitting in the far - infrared , then the bulk of this dust must be heated by star - formation activity rather than the agn . </S>",
    "<S> we discover a kinematically - decoupled component at the center of the disk with a radius smaller than @xmath9 ( 27  pc ) , but which spans approximately the same range of velocities as the surrounding disk . </S>",
    "<S> this component has a higher density than its surroundings , and is a promising candidate for the circumnuclear molecular torus invoked by agn unification models . </S>"
