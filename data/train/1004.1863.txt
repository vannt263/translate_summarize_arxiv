    "devices based on josephson junctions are not only the key elements for the realization of superconducting qubits @xcite but also testbeds for the study of macroscopic quantum phenomena and nonlinear dynamics . in these studies ,",
    "response of the device to resonant or near - resonant microwave fields provides insights to understand their behavior .",
    "numerous works have been reported in the literature , such as the demonstration of energy level quantization in current biased junctions @xcite and rabi oscillations in phase qubits .",
    "@xcite these experiments are usually performed at low temperatures ( @xmath6 20 mk ) in relatively weak microwave field . under such conditions ,",
    "the junctions behave quantum - mechanically and the phase particle may escape from the potential well by macroscopic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) from ground state and/or via photon - assisted tunneling ( pat ) from excited states , depending on the bias current @xmath4 and the microwave frequency @xmath7 .",
    "when the switching current distribution @xmath8 of a current biased junction is measured , mqt from ground state manifests as a peak , which we call the primary peak , centered slightly below the critical current @xmath9 of the junction . in the case of the pat process , a resonant peak at a slightly lower current @xmath10",
    "could be observed in addition to the primary peak in @xmath8 .",
    "the phase escape of a josephson junction at low temperatures exhibits a number of interesting phenomena as the microwave power @xmath2 increases , which can be described as follows .",
    "( 1 ) as mentioned above , when the frequency @xmath7 matches the bias current dependent energy level spacing between the ground and the first excited states at @xmath10 that is close to @xmath11 and @xmath2 is low , the excited state population @xmath12 will be enhanced but remains @xmath13 1 .",
    "this results in a higher escape rate @xmath14 at @xmath10 since @xmath15 .",
    "consequently , a resonant peak at @xmath10 appears in @xmath8 .",
    "because @xmath2 is low , the system s potential and level spacing are essentially unperturbed by microwave field , as reflected in the unchanged position of the primary peak .",
    "( 2 ) when @xmath3 corresponds to the level spacing at a resonance current @xmath10 that is well below @xmath11 and the microwave field is weak , there will be no resonant peak since @xmath16 is still too low to observe at @xmath10 . in this case , as @xmath2 is increased , the position of the primary peak will move continuously to lower bias currents due to the suppression of the effective potential barrier .",
    "@xcite this suppression is particularly strong at resonance , leading to a significant increase of @xmath16 and thus a visible resonant peak .",
    "( 3 ) if @xmath3 matches a fraction of the level spacing and satisfies @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the level spacing between the ground state and the @xmath19th excited state and @xmath20 is a small positive integer , the multiphoton pat process occurs and the corresponding resonant peak appears . ( 4 ) when @xmath2 further increases , the system s nonlinear characteristics such as nonlinear resonance , bifurcation , and chaotic dynamics may emerge .",
    "the resonant peak has also been observed at higher temperatures ( _ e.g. _ 4.2 k ) in the classical regime where thermal activation over the top of the barrier dominates .",
    "@xcite in this regime , when the driving frequency @xmath7 matches the junction s bias current dependent plasma frequency @xmath21 , the classical resonance occurs .",
    "the oscillation amplitude of the phase particle in the potential well and thus the escape rate can be greatly enhanced .",
    "recently , such process and their classical interpretation have been studied in extended temperature range and have received much attention due to a series of works by gronbech - jensen and coworkers . @xcite these authors demonstrated that previously quantum - mechanically explained single- or multi - photon resonance , the effective barrier suppression , and the rabi oscillation",
    "can also be understood from the classical point of view .",
    "interpretations on both the classical and quantum bases are also reported @xcite for the results involving multiphoton , multilevel rabi oscillation , and ac stark shift at high @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite it is found that at high @xmath2 , the predictions of the classical and quantum pictures may converge .",
    "@xcite these results indicate that the josephson junction system can have a _ dual _ character , classical and quantum - mechanical , when a microwave field is applied .    in this paper , we investigate the switching current distribution and the escape rate of a dc squid as a function of microwave field strength at low temperatures .",
    "the squid contains two nb / al - alo@xmath22/nb junctions with josephson inductance much greater than the loop inductance so it behaves as a single junction with a tunable critical current .",
    "we found that as microwave power @xmath2 is increased while frequency @xmath3 is kept constant , the primary peak of @xmath8 first shifts toward lower bias current and then a resonant peak develops .",
    "this result may find a classical explanation , @xcite but here we will show instead that it is also in accordance with the situation ( 2 ) discussed above .",
    "we further found that the effect of two - photon process on escape rate can be observed in this situation .",
    "moreover , as @xmath2 further increases , the primary peak will gradually disappear and the resonant peak grows into a single one while shifting continuously to the lower bias current . at even higher @xmath2",
    ", a second resonant peak appears , which could locate at a very low bias current depending on the value of @xmath3 .",
    "analysis based on the classical equation of motion indicates that such double - resonant - peak structure with a large separation between the two peaks at high @xmath2 can originate from the resonant escape of the phase particle having a very large oscillation amplitude resulting from bifurcation of the nonlinear system driven by a strong microwave field .",

    "@xcite each junction had a diameter of @xmath24 @xmath25 m ( corresponding to an area of @xmath24 @xmath26m@xmath27 ) and the squid loop had an area of @xmath28 @xmath25m@xmath27 . the device s",

    "it is clear that a barrier suppression resulting in a reduction of one or two energy levels in the well is necessary to account for the experimental data in fig .",
    "the calculated level spacing @xmath84 between the ground and first excited states at @xmath10 = 1.79 @xmath25a , which can also be estimated from @xmath85 , is @xmath6 9.6 ghz , which exactly matches the frequency of the applied microwave .",
    "this result demonstrates that the quantum explanation of the resonant phase escape process is applicable . in figs .",

    "the data taken at @xmath87 ghz are plotted in fig .",
    "the most interesting feature of the data in this figure is that a second resonant peak develops when @xmath2 is further increased .",
    "@xcite compared with the previous case of weak microwave field , the separation between the second resonant peak and the first resonant peak is much larger than that between the first resonant peak and the primary peak .",

    "therefore , resonant peak originated from pat ( _ e.g. _ the peaks just below the primary peak in figs .",

    "such distinct results could originate from josephson bifurcation , @xcite a phenomenon common to strongly - driven nonlinear dynamic systems , as discussed below .",
    "it should be pointed out that the number of levels in the potential well at the second resonant peak ( at @xmath6 @xmath91 @xmath25a ) in fig .  4 and the corresponding peak at @xmath6 @xmath90 @xmath25a in fig .  5 would be about @xmath92 and over @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "the presence of so many energy levels during resonant escape , provided a dramatic barrier suppression did not occur , necessitates a many - photon process from the quantum mechanical point of view or motion with extremely large amplitude oscillations from the perspectives of classical dynamics . since it is not clear whether the treatment of fistul _ et al . _",

    "3(c ) and ( d ) where escape rate changes continuously , the bifurcation related escape rate versus dc bias current makes a sudden jump ( dashed parts of the curves in the figure ) when @xmath119 appears . while the rate of escape from the smaller @xmath121 amplitude oscillation is negligible , it increases rapidly when the @xmath119 oscillation appears , which results in switching to occur in a very small range of bias current and therefore a much narrower resonant peak .",
