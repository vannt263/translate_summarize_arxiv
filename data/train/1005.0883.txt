    "a detection of the level of primordial non - gaussianity in the cmb data is crucial to discriminate inflationary models and also to test alternative scenarios for the physics of the early universe . clearly",
    "the study of detectable non - gaussianities in the wmap data ought to take into account that they may have non - cosmological origins as , for example , unsubtracted foreground contamination , unconsidered point sources emission and systematic errors .",
    "deviation from gaussianity may also have a cosmic topology origin ( see , e.g. , the review refs .   and related refs .  ) .",
    "if , on the one hand , different statistical tools can in principle provide information about distinct forms of non - gaussianity , on the other hand one does not expect that a single statistical estimator can be sensitive to all possible forms of non - gaussianity in cmb data . in view of this ,",
    "a great deal of effort has recently gone into verifying the existence of non - gaussianity by employing several statistical estimators ( an incomplete list of references is given , e.g. , in refs .   and references therein ) .",
    "recently we have proposed@xcite two new large - angle non - gaussianity indicators , based on skewness and kurtosis of large - angle patches of cmb maps , which provide measures of the departure from gaussianity on large angular scales .",
    "we used these indicators to search for the large - angle deviation from gaussianity in both band and foreground - reduced maps@xcite with and without a _ kq75 _ mask ( see also the related refs .  ) . here",
    "we briefly summarize the main results of refs .   and  .",
    "a constructive way of formulating our non - gaussianity indicators @xmath0 and @xmath1 from cmb data is through the following steps :    take a finite set of points @xmath2 homogeneously distributed on the cmb celestial sphere @xmath3 as the centers of spherical caps of a given aperture @xmath4 ; and calculate for each cap @xmath5 the skewness ( @xmath6 ) and kurtosis ( @xmath7 ) by using that @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number of pixels in the @xmath10 cap , @xmath11 is the temperature at the @xmath12 pixel , @xmath13 is the cmb mean temperature of the @xmath10 cap , and @xmath14 is the standard deviation . the numbers @xmath6 and @xmath7 obtained in this way for each cap can be seen as a measure of non - gaussianity in the direction of the center @xmath15 of the @xmath10 cap .",
    "patching together the @xmath6 and @xmath7 values for each spherical cap , one obtains two discrete functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 defined on the sphere @xmath3 , which can be used as statistical indicators to measure the deviation from gaussianity as a function of the angular coordinates @xmath18 .",
    "the mollweide projection of skewness and kurtosis functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 are nothing but skewness and kurtosis maps ( hereafter @xmath19map and @xmath20map ) .    clearly , the discrete functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be expanded into their spherical harmonics in order to determine their power spectra @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "thus , for example , for the skewness one has @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "similar expressions obviously hold for the kurtosis @xmath17 .    in the remainder of this work",
    "we shall report the results of our gaussianity analysis performed with @xmath16 and @xmath17 indicators calculated from single frequency and foreground reduced maps with and without a _ kq75 _ mask . to minimize the statistical noise , in the calculations of @xmath19map and @xmath20map from the input maps ,",
    "we have scanned the celestial sphere with spherical caps of aperture @xmath25 , centered at @xmath26 points homogeneously distributed on the two - sphere .",
    "for the sake of brevity we do note show examples of @xmath0 and @xmath1 maps , which provide only _ qualitative _ information on large - angle deviation from gaussianity ( see figures in refs .   for examples )",
    "to obtain _ quantitative _ information about the large angular scale ( low @xmath27 ) distributions for the non - gaussianity @xmath0 and @xmath1 maps obtained from the cmb input maps used , we have calculated the ( low @xmath27 ) power spectra @xmath21 and @xmath22 for @xmath0 and @xmath1 maps .",
    "the deviation from gaussianity and the statistical significance were estimated by comparing these power spectra with the corresponding averaged power spectra @xmath28 and @xmath29 calculated from @xmath0 and @xmath1 maps obtained by averaging over @xmath30 monte - carlo - generated statistically gaussian cmb maps . to have an overall assessment of low @xmath27 power spectra @xmath31 and @xmath32 calculated from each cmb input , we have performed a @xmath33 test to find out the goodness of fit for @xmath21 and @xmath22 multipole values as compared to the expected multipole values from the mc gaussian maps . in this way",
    ", we obtained one number for each map that collectively ( globally ) quantifies the deviation from gaussianity .",
    "for the power spectra @xmath31 calculated from @xmath19maps obtained from the five - years maps with a _",
    "kq75 _ mask we found that the ratio @xmath34 ( dof stands for degree of freedom ) from the k , ka , q , v , and w maps are given , respectively , by @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , while for the kurtosis power spectra @xmath22 of these maps the values of @xmath40 are , respectively , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "clearly a good fit occurs when @xmath46 .",
    "moreover , the greater are the @xmath47 values the smaller are the @xmath33 probabilities , that is the probability that the multipole values @xmath21 and @xmath22 and the expected mc multipole values agree . for @xmath21 and @xmath22 obtained from the full - sky foreground - reduced five years ilc input maps we found that @xmath47 are , respectively , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "these results reduce to @xmath50 and @xmath51 when the _",
    "kq75 _ mask is employed . in brief , our analyses show that the unmasked band maps are significantly non - gaussian but the deviation from gaussianity is substantially reduced to a level compatible with gaussianity for q and v maps , whereas the full - sky foreground reduced five years ilc mask is again significantly non - gaussian but the level of non - gaussianity drops to a level that is consistent with gaussianity when the _ kq75 _ mask is used .",
