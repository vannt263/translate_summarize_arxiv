    "surface plasmons , which are optical modes supported by metal nanoparticles , have been thoroughly investigated for few decades due to their fascinating abilities to confine and enhance electromagnetic field in very sub - wavelength volumes @xcite , at specific wavelengths ruled by the shape of the particle and its nearby environment . for those reasons ,",
    "nanoscale - engineered systems have a large number of applications in domains like biosensing @xcite , enhanced - raman spectroscopy @xcite , metamaterials @xcite , photo - thermal therapy @xcite , and plasmomechanics @xcite .",
    "particularly interesting are systems composed of a small ensemble of closely - coupled metal particles , or of metal films interacting with one or several metal particles placed a few nanometers away @xcite . in those regimes ,",
    "the localized plasmons modes become very sensitive to a variation in length well below the nanometer . in case of extended contact area between a metal film and a metal particle ( nanocubes , nanocylinders ... ) , particular modes form where light is concentrated in between the two flat metal surfaces , with complex field distribution resulting from the interference of propagating plasmons constrained to move in between the particle and the film @xcite . the characteristic of the obtained modes",
    "will strongly depend on the thickness of the spacer layer and the shape of the cavity where the light is trapped .",
    "besides , surface plasmons have been investigated since the middle of the 90s for their sensitivity to mechanical oscillations sustained by metal nanoparticles . the acousto - plasmonic interaction is generally investigated by pump - probe experiments @xcite , where a wealth of phenomena are involved from the excitation of the metal particle by a laser pulse until it is back to equilibrium @xcite , or by raman spectroscopy @xcite . beside their fundamental interest for the understanding of electronic and mechanical properties of metal nanosytems",
    ", these studies may have possible applications to mass sensing @xcite . if the coupling between surface plasmon modes and the mechanical oscillations sustained by metal nanosytems have been studied for a wide range of particle s shapes ( spheres @xcite , cubes @xcite , rods @xcite , columns @xcite , antenna @xcite , crosses @xcite ) , investigations of system composed of interacting metal particle and metal film are still lacking , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the acousto - plasmonic properties of a system made of an array of nanocylinders deposited on a substrate consisting in a thin ( few nanometers thick ) dielectric layer overcoating a gold film .",
    "it has been previously shown by us that such a coupled particle - substrate system supports so - called metal - insulator - metal localized - surface - plasmon modes where the light is essentially enhanced in between the cylinder and the metal film @xcite .",
    "we will see that the confinement of those modes in that portion of the spacer makes them very sensitive to deformation of that volume specifically . in the next section ,",
    "we summarize the plasmonic properties of the system by presenting numerical extinction spectra together with electric field distributions . in the following section ,",
    "we introduce a simple analytical model which allows to derive a closed - form expression giving the wavelengths of the plasmon modes as a function of the shape parameters of the portion of the spacer directly lying under the nanocylinder , and use that model to investigate the wavelength shift of plasmonic modes under different kind of deformation . in the final section , we present the full numerical simulations of the phononic properties of the same system and of the acousto - plasmonic interaction .",
    "we focus particularly on five elastic modes for which the elastic energy is essentially confined in or close to the nanocylinder .",
    "we show that a significant modulation of the transmission spectrum around the resonance wavelengths of the plasmons modes can be obtained , attributed to the particular sensitivity of the mim - plasmon modes to the geometry of the cavity ; an application to pump - probe experiment is finally discussed .",
    "the investigated system is presented in fig .",
    "[ fgr : fig1 ] , and consists in a square array of gold nanocylinders ( auncs ) deposited on a multilayered membrane composed of gold and silica . in the whole paper ,",
    "the auncs have a radius @xmath0 nm and a height @xmath1 nm , the silica spacer is @xmath2 nm thick and has a refractive index of 1.5 , the gold film is @xmath3 nm thick , and lies on a @xmath4 nm - thick membrane of silica .",
    "the period is @xmath5 nm . the refractive index data for gold are from johnson and christy @xcite .",
    "the grating is illuminated in normal incidence from the @xmath6 half space , the electric field being taken parallel to the @xmath7-axis .",
    "the point o is the center of the bottom face of the aunc.,width=321 ]    figure [ fgr : fig2 ] shows the extinction spectrum @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the transmission through the grating ( membrane+auncs ) while @xmath10 is the transmission through the membrane alone ( without the auncs ) , and the absorbance spectrum computed using @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the power losses inside the nanocylinder and @xmath13 the amplitude of the incident electric field .",
    "for that simulation , a commercial finite element program has been used ( comsol ) .",
    "three resonances appear , whose electric field distributions in the polarization @xmath14 plane and in a @xmath15-plane just under the bottom of the auncs are indicated on the right side of fig.2 .",
    "the short wavelength mode ( labeled ( 1 ) , @xmath16 nm ) corresponds to a dipolar mode localized on the top - edge of the nanocylinder , which has been observed both experimentally and theoretically in several systems made of flatten nanoparticles coupled to substrates @xcite .",
    "let us notice that very little light is confined in the spacer directly under the nanoparticle .    .",
    "the absorbance is computed inside the nanocylinder using @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the power losses inside the nanocylinder and @xmath13 the amplitude of the incident electric field .",

    ". the two other modes ( ( 2 ) , @xmath17 nm , and ( 3 ) , @xmath18 nm ) are of very different nature : they correspond indeed to two so - called metal - insulator - metal localized - surface - plasmon ( mim - lsp ) modes localized in the cavity in between the bottom of the nanoparticle and the top of the gold film . that cavity plays an important role in the formation of those modes , and will be called mim - cavity in the following . as we will see in the following",

    "the mim - lsp modes supported by the investigated structure essentially result from the formation of resonant patterns within the circular mim - cavity located in between the particle and the gold film , and limited transversally by the external circular edge of the bottom of the nanocylinder .",

    "it supports mim propagative - surface - plasmon modes ( mim - psp ) whose wavevector @xmath22 depends both on the spacer thickness @xmath23 and the angular frequency @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the speed of light in the vacuum .",
    "the corresponding dispersion curve is plotted in fig .",
    "3(a ) for @xmath2 nm . notice that only the dispersion curve of the mim - psp has been plotted , but the system supports several other modes ( guided modes inside the spacer and propagative plasmons on the top and bottom metal surface of the membrane ) . for that geometry ,",
    "the effective index is @xmath26 for a wavelength in vacuum of @xmath27 nm , which corresponds to a mode wavelength of about @xmath28 nm along the interface .",
    "hence the mim - psp mode has a typical length scale comparable to the nanocylinder diameter , which explains why those propagative waves can form resonant patterns on a surface with very sub - wavelength size . as indicated on fig .",
    "3(b ) , the effective index is strongly dependent of the spacer layer thickness , and increases , for a given wavelength , when the spacer is thinner .    from the numerical evaluation of @xmath29 as a function of the frequency for a given thickness @xmath23 ,",
    "the wavelengths and the shapes of the mim - lsp modes can be simply explained by describing them as a linear superposition of mim - psp propagating in different directions ( given by the direction of @xmath30 ) under the nanoparticle .",
    "such a superposition necessarily obeys the wave equation @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "let us notice that the wavevector @xmath29 still depends both on the angular frequency of light @xmath34 and on the spacer thickness @xmath23 , but those variables have been hidden for clarity .",
    "the solutions of that equation in polar coordinates @xmath35 are of the form @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is an amplitude factor , and @xmath38 the bessel function of first kind and of integer order @xmath39 . rigorously speaking",
    ", @xmath37 depends on @xmath40 , but this dependency is very weak in the spacer layer ( see profile of the mode in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fgr : fig3](a ) ) and will be neglected in the following . in order to find the values taken by @xmath29 , and then the wavelengths @xmath41 , for each mim - lsp mode , a proper boundary condition must be applied at the edge of the cavity , in @xmath42 . as a simple rule",
    ", we notice that plasmonic modes generally lead to large intensity enhancement at sharp edges of metallic structures , which happens in particular in our case at the bottom circular edge of the auncs .",
    "hence , the electric field being mostly vertical in the mim - cavity as shown on the field distributions of fig .",
    "[ fgr : fig2 ] for modes ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , we choose values of @xmath29 such that the @xmath40 component of the electric field reaches a maximum at @xmath42 .",
    "this leads to @xmath43 , where the prime denotes the derivative of the bessel function with respect to its argument .",
    "we finally obtain the following expression for the @xmath40-component of the electric field : @xmath44 with the dispersion equation : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is an integer larger than 1 and @xmath47 are the zeros of the bessel function s derivative . that relation is exactly the same as the one giving the cutoff wavelengths of the first te modes in a circular metal waveguide .",
    "the first twelve values of the coefficients @xmath47 are : @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",

    "[ fgr : fig3](c ) .",
    "we can immediately notice on fig .",
    "[ fgr : fig2 ] that the two mim - lsp modes labeled ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) correspond , owing to their field distribution , to the modes @xmath60 and @xmath61 in the analytical model .",
    "we compare in fig .",
    "[ fgr : fig3](d ) the position of the mim - lsp modes predicted by the analytical model with the one resulting from the full numerical simulations of the absorption spectra as a function of the nanocylinder radius , for an incident plane wave at a tilted angle of 60@xmath62 , measured from the @xmath63 axis .",
    "it is necessary to use a tilted illumination in order to excite more mim - lsp modes , as the normal incidence imposes a selection rule on the excited modes which must be symmetric with respect to the @xmath64 plane and antisymmetric with respect to the @xmath14 plane . in particular ,",
    "the modes with even @xmath39 can not be excited in normal incidence .",
    "the agreement between the simulation and the model is pretty good , slight red - shifts occur in the simulation compared to the model , more particularly for the @xmath65 mode . however , the variations of the wavelength with the radius of the particle match very well in both approaches",
    "we will now assess the effect of a modification of the shape of the mim - cavity under an elastic deformation . that deformation is physically induced by the movement of the aunc above the spacer when a particular elastic mode is excited .",
    "computer simulations of those modes are presented in the next section , however we show here that most of the physics is captured by considering the shape of the mim - cavity independently of the aunc .",
    "we are interested here in two types of cavity deformations . in the first ,",
    "called `` radial breathing deformation '' , the cavity undergoes an isotropic oscillation of its radius at the elastic frequency , while the thickness of the cavity oscillates accordingly in phase opposition compared to the radius : when the cavity expands , it becomes thinner , and thicker when it contracts . in the second type of mode ,",
    "called `` multipolar deformation '' , the radius oscillates with a harmonic angle variation : @xmath66 , @xmath67 . in that case",
    ", we suppose that the top and bottom surfaces of the cavity keep the same area to the lowest order in @xmath68 , and that the thickness of the cavity stays mostly unchanged during the acoustic period .    _",
    "radial breathing deformation . _ that deformation changes both @xmath69 and @xmath23 .",
    "it is convenient to examine first a change of the radius of the mim - cavity while keeping its thickness constant , and second a change of the thickness of the mim - cavity while its radius is kept constant . starting from @xmath70 ( eq . [ eq1 ] ) , we obtain : @xmath71\\ ] ] we introduce @xmath72 , which represents the sensitivity of the mim - lsp mode wavelength to a modification of the particle radius , keeping the thickness of the spacer layer constant .",
    "writing @xmath73 in the previous expression , we find : @xmath74 in a similar way , we obtain the sensitivity @xmath75 of the mim - lsp mode wavelength to a modification of the spacer layer thickness : @xmath76 the factor @xmath77 allows to scale @xmath78 to values comparable to @xmath79 , by taking similar deformation in thickness ( @xmath80 ) and radius ( @xmath81 ) in both situations .",
    "next , we need to introduce the ratio @xmath82 of the radius deformation @xmath81 compared to the thickness deformation @xmath80 : @xmath83 the minus sign accounts for the phase opposition between the deformation in radius and the deformation in thickness . in case of a cylinder in vacuum , submitted to a force applied symmetrically on its top and bottom faces ,",
    "this coefficient identifies with the poisson s ratio @xmath84 .",
    "however , in that situation @xmath82 can not be predicted _ a priori _ but will be estimated later from the numerical simulations of the corresponding elastic eigenmode .",
    "as the resonance wavelength is a function of @xmath23 and @xmath69 : @xmath85 by combining equations [ eq2 ] and [ eq3 ] , we finally obtain the sensitivity @xmath86 of the mim - lsp wavelength @xmath41 under a breathing deformation : @xmath87    _ multipolar deformation .",
    "_ we suppose here that the thickness of the mim - cavity does not change during the deformation , but that the radius of the mim cavity is of the form @xmath66 at the considered time of the acoustic deformation , @xmath88 being the radius of the particle at rest.we need to evaluate how much a mim - lsp mode of order @xmath89 is modified under that deformation . for that purpose",
    ", we expand that mode on the basis of functions solution of the wave equation in cylindrical coordinates ( see above ) : @xmath90 with @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the new boundary condition reads : @xmath93'\\left(r(\\phi),\\phi\\right)=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\alpha_{n}\\cos(n\\phi)j_n\\left[q_{pl}(r_0+\\delta r \\cos(m\\phi))\\right]\\ ] ] as the deformation is weak , the value of @xmath94 stays close to @xmath95 , and we write it @xmath96 .",
    "to the first order in @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , with @xmath100 : @xmath101\\right\\rbrace j''_n(x'_{np})\\\\ & + \\sum_{n\\ne n}\\alpha_{n}\\cos(n\\phi)j'_n(x'_{np})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can verify that @xmath102 corresponds to the radial breathing deformation , and then @xmath103 if @xmath104 : the shape of the mim - lsp mode is unchanged as the mim - cavity is still exactly cylindrical .",
    "the only effect is a shift of the resonance wavelength . however , when @xmath67 , @xmath105 only if @xmath106 , which happens only if @xmath107 is even . in that case , the only mode affected by the deformation is @xmath108 , and : @xmath109 @xmath110 @xmath111 @xmath112 the wavelength of the deformed mode @xmath108 is then given by : @xmath113r_0=x'_{np}\\left[1-\\frac{\\delta r}{2r_0}\\right]\\approx x'_{np}+r_0\\left.\\frac{\\partial   q_{pl}}{\\partial \\lambda}\\right|_e \\delta\\lambda\\ ] ] finally ,",
    "the sensitivity of the mim - lsp mode wavelength under a multipolar deformation is independent on @xmath107 and reads : @xmath114 figure 4(a ) shows the evolution of @xmath115 and @xmath79 with the resonance wavelength @xmath41 of the mim - lsp mode , for @xmath2 nm . the sensitivity to the spacer thickness @xmath78 is negative , because when the spacer thickness increases ( @xmath116 ) , the effective index @xmath117 decreases : in order to satisfy the mim - lsp excitation condition , the wavelength must then be shorter ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "however , @xmath79 is positive : an increase in diameter obviously does not change the effective index , and the wavelength must increase to compensate @xmath119 .",
    "we can additionally see that in the whole range of investigated wavelengths , @xmath120 by a factor of about 0.8 around @xmath41=600 nm to about 0.5 around @xmath121 @xmath122 m .",

    "[ fgr : fig4](b ) , which , similarly as fig .",
    "[ fgr : fig4](a ) , shows the evolution of @xmath86 and @xmath123 with the wavelength .",
    "in particular , @xmath86 has been evaluated for several values of @xmath82 between 0.3 and 0.9 .",
    "it appears clearly that @xmath86 is always larger that @xmath123 , because the wavelength shifts @xmath78 and @xmath79 cumulate when the cavity undergoes a radial breathing deformation , as an increase in radius generally induces a decrease in thickness . for example , @xmath86 and @xmath123 , which are both positive , differ for @xmath124 by a factor of about 5.5 to 4.5 from 600 nm to 1 @xmath122 m , the change in wavelength induced by a radial breathing deformation being then significantly larger that the one induced by a multipolar deformation which does not change the mim - cavity thickness .",
    "for the numerical simulations , a commercial finite element method has been used ( comsol ) in order to be able to simultaneously investigate the plasmonic , phononic , and coupled acousto - plasmonic aspects .",
    "the radio - frequency module is employed for the photonic simulations , while the structural - mechanics module is used for the phononic simulations .",
    "first , we investigate the elastic properties of the structure described in fig .",
    "[ fgr : fig1 ] ( @xmath0 nm , @xmath1 nm , @xmath2 nm , @xmath3 nm , @xmath4 nm , @xmath5 nm ) by computing the elastic eigenmodes and eigenfrequencies of a unit cell of the grating .",
    "free interfaces boundary conditions are applied on the topmost surfaces of the aunc and the silica spacer , and on the bottom surface of the 144nm - thick silica layer , while periodic boundary conditions are applied on the lateral boundary of the unit cell .",
    "the elastic parameters for silica and gold have been taken in royer and dieulesaint @xcite .",

    "overall , the structure supports a lot of modes , most of which are strongly dispersive and have elastic energy spread all around the auncs .",
    "however , for five modes at the @xmath126 point most of the energy is localized in or close to the aunc , as indicated by their displacement distribution .",
    "their respective frequencies are 3.7 ghz ( two degenerated modes along the @xmath7 and @xmath135 directions ) , 4.0 ghz , 4.2 ghz , and 5.6 ghz , their displacement maps are indicated in fig .",
    "the color map shows the amplitude of the displacement vector @xmath127 ( real at the @xmath126 point ) , while the green arrows indicate the displacement itself .",
    "the deformation is obviously exaggerated in order to more clearly show the shape of the mode . on the right side of each displacement maps",
    "is represented the deformed 6-nm - thick spacer layer .",
    "the deformation is again amplified for clarity , and the colorscale represents either the @xmath40 component of @xmath130 ( @xmath131 , top ) or @xmath132 ( @xmath133 , bottom ) .",
    "the first quantity indicates the rotation experienced by the mim - cavity around the vertical ( @xmath40 ) axis , while the second shows its relative change in thickness .",
    "these maps emphasize the differences between the three excited modes and their potential effect on the mim - lsp modes .",
    "the two lowest frequency modes at 3.7 ghz are degenerated , and correspond to flexural deformations along the @xmath136 or the @xmath137 axis of the square grating . as a result ,",
    "the nanocylinder and the mim - cavity oscillate together around either the @xmath136 or the @xmath137 axis , and very small deformation occurs in the mim - cavity : its shape is mostly unchanged and the coupling between that elastic mode and the mim - lsp is expected to be weak . yet , we will have to differentiate the @xmath7 and @xmath135 flexural modes in the plasmon - phonon coupling as the incident electric field is polarized along the @xmath7-axis .",
    "the next mode at 4.0ghz is an azimuthal shear deformation mode where the displacement is essentially orthoradial , enhanced close to the circular top edge of the nanocylinder but much lower at its bottom . under that deformation ,",
    "the mim - cavity undergoes no compression ( constant thickness and radius ) but a clear rotation around the vertical axis . that displacement is coupled to a very weak radial breathing movement which corresponds to a small increase of the volume of the particle , which reaches a maximum every half an acoustic period .",
    "again , this mode is not expected to strongly couple with the mim - lsps .",
    "the mode at 4.2 ghz is a quadrupolar mode , enhanced on the top part of the nanoparticle , with displacement maxima along the main directions of the grating .",
    "that mode is symmetric compared to both @xmath138 and @xmath139 planes , and does not strongly affect the volume of the nanoparticle , as the expansion / contraction along the @xmath7 direction is balanced by the opposite displacement in the @xmath135 direction .",
    "the mim - cavity undergoes a quadrupolar deformation , which results in a slight vertical compression / dilatation at its circular edge : the thickness of the mim - cavity is hardly modified except close to its border .",
    "hence , the radius of the cavity follows at that frequency an azimuthal - angle dependency of the form @xmath66 with @xmath140 .",
    "finally , the high - frequency mode at 5.6 ghz clearly shows a vertical compression / dilatation of the nanocylinder , while its average radius correspondingly increases and decreases during an acoustic period .",
    "the displacement map is mostly symmetric compared to any plane perpendicular to the substrate containing the particle revolution axis ( despite slightly deformed by the closest neighboring particles along the @xmath141 and @xmath142 axes ) .",
    "similarly , the mim - cavity keeps its circular shape during the deformation , its radius alternately increases and decreases while its thickness decreases and increases .",
    "however , contrary to the 4.0ghz mode , the rotation of that mode around the perpendicular axis is very small .",
    "finally , the mim - cavity at that frequency clearly undergoes a radial breathing deformation as presented in the analytical model .      in that section",
    ", we investigate the influence of the five previous elastic modes on the optical properties of the system . for that purpose ,",
    "the deformed geometry corresponding to each mode is computed for different phases @xmath143 during half an acoustic period , where @xmath144 is the eigenfrequency of the considered elastic mode .",
    "the origin of phase is chosen such as @xmath145 corresponds to the structure at rest .",
    "the amplitude of the deformation is chosen such as the maximum of the elastic displacement in the nanocylinder is taken equal to 2% of its radius , which gives here @xmath146 nm . then , that deformed structure is used to compute the extinction spectrum under the same illumination conditions as in section 2 , at the given phase @xmath147 .",
    "let us mention that , at the scale of the crystalline network , the corresponding deformation is of about @xmath148% , which is huge and not physically meaningful .",
    "for instance , in reference @xcite , authors estimate that the length increase of their 150-nm - long nanorods is on the order of 5 pm for the considered acoustic modes , which gives a deformation of about 3.3 10@xmath149 . for numerical purpose",
    "it is necessary to use larger values , however the obtained quantities can then be scaled to smaller deformation in order to obtain realistic figures . in the following",
    ", the modulated spectra will be analyzed to assess the strength of the coupling , using two methods . in the first ,",
    "the shift in wavelength of the different plasmon modes is evaluated as a function of the acoustic phase @xmath150 , and in the second , the relative variation of the transmission is computed for realistic deformations , similarly to what can be realized in a typical pump - probe experiment .     for different values of the elastic phase for the five modes of fig .",

    "the differences between the five modes are very obvious .",
    "first , the two flexural modes at 3.7ghz and the azimuthal shear deformation mode at 4.0ghz produce no changes neither in the extinction nor in the absorption spectra .",
    "that result is obvious for the 4.0ghz mode as the displacement is essentially orthoradial and then does barely move or deform any interfaces in the system . for the flexural modes , despite the fact that interfaces move , neither the shape of the particle nor the shape of the mim - cavity is modified , as they both rotate undeformed around the @xmath7- or the @xmath135- axis .",
    "the second mode at 4.2ghz however induces noticeable modifications which are more easily observable on the absorption spectrum around the main resonance at 750 nm ( mim - lsp mode @xmath61 ) .",
    "finally , the high frequency mode at 5.6ghz produces the largest modifications , easily observable both in the extinction and the absorption spectra , and mostly in the range of wavelengths where the mim - lsp modes are excited . in the following , we focus only on the quadrupolar mode at 4.2ghz and the vertical breathing mode at 5.6ghz .",

    "the shortest - wavelength mode at 525 nm is less sensitive with @xmath153=-0.3 nm .",
    "the wavelength shifts obtained with the @xmath144=5.6 ghz elastic mode are much larger for the two mim - lsp modes with @xmath153=2.9 nm for the 615 nm mode and @xmath153=6.4 nm for the 750 nm mode .",
    "however , the 525 nm mode shows almost no wavelength dependency with a @xmath153=-0.02 nm .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tb1 ]    the agreement is overall qualitatively correct in the four cases , with the largest discrepancy for the 615 nm lsp/5.6ghz elastic mode , and the best agreement for the 615 nm mim - lsp/4.2ghz elastic mode .",
    "the sensitivity is underestimated by the analytical model for the 4.2ghz mode but overestimated for the 5.6ghz mode .",
    "differences might partly be attributed to the fact that the analytical model is very simplified as it does not take into account the precise shape of the cavity , nor the fact that the mim - psp wave vector is complex . however , the strong increase in sensitivity with the radial breathing elastic mode compared to the quadrupolar mode is correctly obtained in both cases , which makes us think that the physics of the coupling is correctly captured even with that simplified description . in particular , the enhanced wavelength shift with the high frequency acoustic deformation is clearly due to the cumulative effect of the expansion of the mim - cavity ( radius ) and the contraction of the spacer layer ( thickness )",
    ".    finally , we estimate in that section the time - modulation of the transmission spectra for more realistic deformations of the structure under coupling with the quadrupolar and radial breathing acoustic deformations .     for the different phases @xmath147 of the two elastic modes at f=4.2ghz , ( a ) , and f=5.6ghz , ( b ) , where @xmath160 is the transmission through the deformed structure at phase @xmath147 and @xmath161 the transmission through the structure at rest.,width=321 ]    for that , we start from the fact that in the limit of weak deformation , the evolution of the transmission spectrum @xmath160 is a harmonic function of time for every fixed wavelength .",
    "this is relied here to the fact that the displacement vector @xmath162 is real : at a certain time @xmath163 of the acoustic period , the displacement will then be at every point @xmath164 : changing the amplitude of the displacement is completely equivalent to changing the sine of the phase @xmath150 of the acoustic mode .",
    "despite the fact that the transmission might oscillate with @xmath165 in some situations @xcite , this is not the case here .",
    "figure [ fgr : fig8](a ) shows , for the two acoustic modes , the relative difference @xmath166 between the modulated @xmath160 and the unmodulated transmission @xmath161 as a function of the acoustic phase @xmath147 : @xmath167 is a mostly symmetric function of the phase , and whatever the wavelength , the modulation of the optical transmission has the same period than the elastic mode .",
    "following that idea , we compute for every wavelength the slope @xmath168 of the tangent to the modulated transmission @xmath160 in @xmath145 , from which we can evaluate the relative variation of transmission @xmath166 for any arbitrarily small deformation of the structure using : @xmath169 where @xmath170 is a coefficient corresponding to the chosen `` realistic '' deformation @xmath171 , and @xmath172 is the reference deformation used in the simulation .",
    "figure 9 shows the relative variation in transmission of the modulated system under the two elastic deformations as a function of time . in case of a pump - probe experiment ,",
    "the amplitude of the modulation should be damped due to the losses , which are not taken into account here @xcite .",
    "the two diagrams have been plotted using a typical deformation of the structure of @xmath173 , which correspond to a maximum displacement of about 3 pm inside the aunc . for both acoustic modes ,",
    "the obtained numbers are comparable to the values obtained experimentally in @xcite , of about 10@xmath174 , and reaches 8.9 10@xmath174 close to the 750 nm mim - lsp mode when the structure is deformed by the radial breathing elastic mode : this corresponds to an increase of 4.6 in the oscillation amplitude of @xmath175 compared to the amplitude obtained with the quadrupolar elastic mode .    .",
    "the blue curve is the unmodulated transmission @xmath161.,width=321 ]",
    "using a combination of finite elements numerical simulations and a simplified analytical model , we have provided physical insight in both the origin of the mim - lsp modes supported by auncs on a thin silica film coating a metal interface , and their coupling with elastic modes supported by the same system , for which the movement of the auncs induces a deformation of the cavity formed by the portion of the silica spacer underneath . due to the nature of the mim - lsp , the three lowest - frequency elastic modes ( flexural and azimuthal shear deformation modes ) , which do not modify the shape of that cavity , do not change significantly the optical response of the system .",
    "however , stronger effect is obtained when the aunc , and then the mim - cavity , experiences a quadrupolar deformation or even better a radial breathing movement .",
    "the latter clearly results in an enhanced wavelength shift and transmission modulation , due to the cumulative effect of the increase / decrease of the cavity s radius and the corresponding contraction / dilatation of its thickness . compared to the quadrupolar deformation which only affects the radius ,",
    "both the wavelength shifts and the transmission modulation are increased by a factor of about 4.6 .",
    "that structure could give interesting results in a typical pump - probe experiment , despite the fact that efficiency of the coupling between the probe and the vibration of the particle is not precisely known , but only estimated from other publications .",
