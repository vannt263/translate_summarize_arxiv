    "exfoliated thin - layer black phosphorus has been realized recently@xcite .",
    "phosphorene , a mono - layer of black phosphorus with a finite direct gap , is expected to be a new candidate of the family of pure two - dimensional materials .",
    "phosphorene has attracted widespread interest due to its excellent electronic , optical and mechanical properties .",
    "compared to graphene , phosphorene field - effect transistors have a higher on - off current ratio at room temperature@xcite , which gives phosphorene a great potential for switching device fabrication . moreover , unlike graphene , which is sensitive to the substrates@xcite , phosphorene is expected to be more reliable .",
    "in contrast with transition metal dichalcogenides , phosphorene exhibits a higher carrier mobility.@xcite phosphorene has a strongly anisotropic band structure , which allows phosphorene to act as optical polarized - sensitive device@xcite . due to the puckering lattice structure , phosphorene possesses a superior flexibility and sustains a tensile strain up to about 30@xmath0 in either the zigzag or the armchair direction and shows a great power in practical strain engineering.@xcite by applying in - plane or vertical strain , the energy gap can be tuned gradually,@xcite and the semiconductor - to - metal transition can be induced.@xcite a considerable increase of effective mass induced by the strain suggests a great potential for switching devices.@xcite furthermore , strain is regarded as an efficient method to enhance the thermoelectric performance of phosphorene.@xcite    most literatures about the strain effects on phosphorene are based on first - principle calculations .",
    "numerical methods can handle the complexity of real materials while lack of clear understanding in physics .",
    "recently , tight - banding parameters were obtained from _ ab initio _ calculations , and the dispersion of it fits well with the numerical one.@xcite the tight - binding model allows one to get simple solutions to predict various properties of phosphorene under strain and shed more insight on the strain - induced physics .    in this paper , we studied the electronic structure and optic absorption of phosphorene under strain .",
    "the band gap depends positively on the in - plane strain and negatively on the vertical strain . by adjusting uniaxial strains in three principle directions ,",
    "the band gap can be reduced to zero and for this situation , the dispersion is linear in the armchair direction and is quadratic in the zigzag direction . in other words ,",
    "the semi - dirac band structure turns up when band gap is closed by strain .",
    "a tensile strain along armchair direction increases the effective mass components in both directions , the strain in zigzag direction changes them in two directions in opposite way , and the vertical strain only has significant effect on the effective mass along armchair direction .",
    "the band - edge optic absorption is completely polarized along the armchair direction , and the polarization rate decreases when the photon energy increases .",
    "strain changes the absorption polarization as well as absorption edge .",
    "the in - plane geometry parameters ( in units of @xmath1 ) of the phosphorene lattice are @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and the thickness ( the distance between sublayers ) is @xmath4.@xcite the hopping energies @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively,@xcite all in units of ev .",
    "the former two hopping energies play the most significant role in constructing the electronic structure , other smaller ones only modulate the band structure slightly .",
    "when a strain is applied , the lattice mesh is deformed .",
    "the deformed coordinates @xmath15 are related with the undeformed coordinates @xmath16 by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the strain in @xmath19-direction . in the equation and from here on",
    ", we use the subscript @xmath20 to denote quantities of undeformed phosphorene , and those without the subscript 0 means they are for strained phosphorene .",
    "the deformed bond length @xmath21 can be expressed as @xmath22 where the coefficients @xmath23 are calculated as @xmath24    the change of the bond length leads to the corresponding modulation of the hopping energy . in phosphorene",
    ", the hopping energy is determined by the coupling between @xmath25 and @xmath26 orbitals of different phosphorus atoms .",
