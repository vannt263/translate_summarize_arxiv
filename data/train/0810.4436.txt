    "the question of vortex - antivortex ( vav ) states in mesoscopic samples is one of the most intriguing ones in superconductivity studies of the last decade . being stabilized in a homogeneous magnetic field , vav states are counterintuitive and rather difficult to explain in usual terms . nevertheless , by analyzing the solutions of the linearized ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory , chibotaru _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite predicted their stability in flat superconducting squares as a consequence of the symmetry of the sample .",
    "namely , in linear theory , the geometry of the sample boundaries directly translates on the vortex states . as a consequence , for three fluxons captured by the sample ( i.e. vorticity @xmath1 ) ,",
    "the vortex state with four vortices and one antivortex can be energetically more favorable than the triangular configuration of single vortices .",
    "still , one should bear in mind that the linear approach of ref .",
    "@xcite is only valid at the superconducting / normal ( s / n ) boundary , where @xmath2 is extremely small and the non - linear term in the gl theory becomes negligible . in a further step @xcite , by taking into account the non - linearity of the first gl equation , the existence of vav states was predicted to persist even away from the s / n phase boundary .",
    "the antivortex for @xmath1 in a square of size @xmath3 was shown to be stable in a temperature range of about @xmath4 ( with @xmath5 being the coherence length at @xmath6 , and @xmath7 the critical temperature ) . up to now",
    ", such vav configurations have not been realized in experiment . from a theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "there are several reasons why these novel vortex states escaped experimental observation : first , even a tiny defect at the boundary ( @xmath8 ) destroys the vortex - antivortex state @xcite .",
    "second , the vortices and the antivortex are all confined in a small area of typical size less than the coherence length @xmath9 . as a consequence , this proximity results in a strong local suppression of the order parameter @xmath2 which makes the separate minima experimentally undistinguishable - the vortex configuration as a whole is very similar to a single giant - vortex . and third",
    ", imaging of the magnetic field profile is also shortcoming : the field generated by the sample is proportional to the supercurrent which is rather weak in the vav region ( being directly related to @xmath2 ) .",
    "therefore , for future experimental verification of the vav states , it is essential : i ) to increase the vortex - antivortex distance , allowing for measurements with realistic spatial resolution ; ii ) to obtain a larger contrast in the order parameter , and iii ) the magnetic field , required for e.g. scanning tunnelling and hall - probe microscopy measurements .",
    "however , to observe the pure vav nucleation , we should realize this in a _ homogeneous _ magnetic field , contrary to the suggestion of ref .",

    "the pinning force is supposed to pull the vortices further from the sample center and thus create a larger separation between the vortices and the central antivortex . in what follows",
    ", we will elaborate further on this concept , and demonstrate a number of its advantages .",
    "contrary to ref .",
    "@xcite where we considered only the square geometry , here we expand the study to different polygonal shapes of the sample and geometry of the pinning .",
    "in addition , while previous studies @xcite only studied vav configurations in extremely thin samples , we consider samples of finite ( though relatively small ) thickness , by incorporating magnetic screening effects in the calculation .",

    "iii we present our results , and determine the optimal pinning parameters to enhance the stability range of the vortex - antivortex configuration .",
    "the influence of imperfections and defects on the superconducting state is discussed in sec .",
    "iv , the competition of different symmetries in the sample is treated ( sec .",
    "v ) , e.g. a disk with a number of holes .",
    "next we describe the influence of the non - linear term in gl theory and gl parameter @xmath10 , i.e. screening ( sec .",
    "vi ) and some guidelines for a possible experimental observation ( sec .",
    "finally , we summarize our findings in sec . viii .",
    "it is already well established that the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) formalism gives an accurate description of the superconducting state of low-@xmath7 superconductors , and is well suited to incorporate boundary effects in the treatment of the mesoscopic superconductors .",
    "the gl theory postulates the following expression for the free energy of the system ( in dimensionless form ) :    @xmath11 . \\label{glfreeen}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here all distances are measured in units of the coherence length @xmath12 .",

    "two coupled non - linear differential equations , one for the order parameter and one for the vector potential , can be derived using variation analysis .",
    "we are interested in thin , but finite - thickness , samples in a perpendicular applied field , where we may neglect the variation of the magnetic field and order parameter over the thickness of the sample .",
    "accordingly , we average the gl equations over the sample thickness @xcite , and write them as    @xmath24    where @xmath25 denotes the supercurrent density , and @xmath26 is the effective ginzburg - landau parameter , the consequence of averaging over sample thickness @xmath27 .",
    "it s worth emphasizing that @xmath0 is temperature dependent ( e.g. through @xmath9 in the denominator ) .",
    "all considered samples in this paper , treated with the full non - linear gl theory , have the same thickness @xmath28 .",

    "@xcite solved only the first gl equation , and restricted themselves to the limit of @xmath34 , or extreme type ii superconductors , we solve numerically _ both _ equations .",
    "the strength of the influence of the second gl equation is governed by @xmath35 . when @xmath36 ( thus for @xmath37 and/or @xmath38 ) , eq .",
    "( [ gleq2 ] ) can indeed be neglected .",

    "the winding number of a vortex is defined as the integer number of @xmath41 phase changes of the order parameter when circling around the vortex core .",
    "consequently , the vorticity of a vortex is defined as 1 , and the vorticity of an antivortex as -1",
    ". the total vorticity of a particular vortex configuration can also be determined at the sample boundary @xmath42 by the formula    @xmath43    the vortex state of small mesoscopic superconductors is strongly influenced by the imposed topological confinement .",
    "the shape of the sample boundaries is introduced in our calculation through the neumann boundary condition , which sets the supercurrent perpendicular to the boundary equal to zero :    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the normal unit vector on the surface . in refs .",
    "@xcite a unitary transformation was used in combination with a certain gauge for the vector potential such that for the linear gl equation @xmath46 on the sample boundary .",
    "this approach is restricted to simple geometries ( i.e. polygons ) and can not be applied to our multiple connected samples that contain holes .",
    "our numerical approach is based on a finite difference gauss - seidel relaxation for the time dependent gl equations .",
    "the numerical technique we applied is the one introduced in ref .",

    "@xcite , to speed up convergence .",
    "we solve the gl equations on a uniform cartesian grid typically with @xmath47 points .",
    "since the vav state is a consequence of the symmetry of the sample boundary and because of the most efficient reflection of this symmetry into the solutions of the linearized ginzburg - landau ( lgl ) theory , the lgl formalism is the ideal instrument to study the influence of the geometry on the vav state . from a numerical point of view ,",
    "the lgl approach is far less demanding , and can still provide us with the minimal requirements for the realization of the vav states .    the linear theory is _ exactly valid only on the s / n boundary _",
    ", i.e. when the @xmath48 term can be neglected . due to the weak superconducting order parameter , the magnetic field equals the applied one and the second gl equation can be discarded . at the same time , eq .",
    "( [ gleq1 ] ) becomes    @xmath49    where @xmath50 now is equivalent to an eigenvalue .",
    "an important property of eq .",
    "( [ lgleq ] ) is that its solution is independent of the size of the sample , as long as the applied flux is held constant , i.e. the lgl method is a scalable theory .    to be able to compare the solutions of the lgl obtained for different geometries",
    ", one has to make sure that they have the same normalization .",
    "we use the following normalization of the wave function , @xmath51 = 1 , or equivalently @xmath52 , where the integration is performed over the sample volume @xmath53 .",
    "this matches the uniform solution of @xmath17 in the whole sample in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "our aim is to use the lgl model deeper inside the superconducting state , even though it is strictly not valid , simply as a limiting case of the full gl theory . for that purpose",
    "we still derive the generated magnetic field profile using eq .",
    "( [ gleq2 ] ) .",
    "although the lgl theory is not able to determine an absolute order of magnitude of the field ( because @xmath54 ) , it gives the correct magnetic field up to a multiplication constant , and thus allows for comparison of field profiles for different sample geometries .",
    "we compute the vector potential @xmath13 from the calculated distribution of supercurrents , for taken @xmath55 . for this purpose , we solve two independent poisson equations ( for @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) using the fast fourier transform .",
    "magnetic field is then obtained as @xmath58 .",
    "the relative magnetic field profile found in this way turns out to be rather accurate , even when going deeper in the superconducting state ( e.g. by decreasing temperature ) .",
    "when compared with a calculation based on the full non - linear gl theory , the main effect of the second equation is to enhance the magnetic field generated by the sample .    as an advantage , to solve eq .",
    "( [ lgleq ] ) is computationally not very demanding , and we use the numerical package comsol ( formerly known as femlab ) for this purpose .",
    "this software package uses the finite element method to solve differential equations .",
    "its profound precision ( in solving linear equations ) allows us to significantly increase the grid resolution , for instance , in the neighborhood of the vav complex .",
    "the use of triangular finite elements proved as a more accurate treatment of the sample s geometry than we could achieve with a rectangular grid , for an arbitrary sample geometry .",
    "therefore , our linear approach is well suited for comparison of the vav state in different samples .",
    "we will use it to determine the optimal hole parameters and to study the influence of imperfections and defects .",
    "we will also treat the competition of different pinning symmetries and samples with different geometries , like e.g. perforated disks , in search for novel vav states .",

    "our aim is to enhance the parameters that characterize the vav state .",

    "the influence of the holes on the vortices is determined by their position and their size .",
    "how can we enhance e.g. the vortex - antivortex separation by manipulating these parameters ?",
    "holes are known to be pinning sites , i.e. they attract vortices . by placing four holes",
    ", we can pull the vortices , which surround the antivortex , away from the antivortex .",
    "the larger the hole , the stronger the attraction .",
    "the forces on the antivortex are exactly cancelled because of the symmetric position of the holes .",
    "however , the vortices also experience inward forces , i.e. they are attracted by the antivortex and additionally the meissner current also compresses the vortices to the inside of the sample .",
    "the vortices eventually will find an equilibrium position , in which the inward and outward forces cancel exactly .",
    "this position depends of the distance of the hole to the center and of the size of this hole .    to understand the influence of the hole parameters ( size and position ) we introduce a criterium which we can use as a guide to determine the optimal hole parameters .",
    "this criterium is : what is the minimum hole size for a given hole position , such that the vortex is still captured by the hole ?",
    "it seems that when holes are made larger , they attract the vortices more strongly and eventually the vortex will be captured by the hole , when the holes are placed not too close to the boundary of the sample .",

    "[ optholessizepossquare ] and [ optholessizepostriangle ] .",
    "we note that the curves of @xmath72 and @xmath61 are isomorphous .",
    "we expect this , because latexmath:[$|\\psi|_{max}^{2 } \\propto    maximum @xmath72 and , as a consequence , @xmath61 in a triangle appear to be 40 % less than for the square .    from these figures",
    ", we can conclude that , for both the square and the triangle shaped samples , moving the holes farther from the center implies enlarging them , in order to keep the vortices trapped by the holes . from a certain distance @xmath60 ,",
    "the needed hole size @xmath76 diverges , i.e. from a certain distance of the holes , they can never be made large enough to trap the vortices that surround the antivortex .",
    "for both the square and the triangle , this distance @xmath77 is about 30% .",
    "while for the square increasing the distance always implies an increase of @xmath72 and @xmath61 , this is not true for the triangle : from a distance @xmath78 these observables start degrading",
    ".    however these results apply to a specific shape of the holes , and in principle it is not fair to compare the perforated square with the perforated triangle , since the holes have different shape . for the square , the trapped vortex is located in the corner of the square hole ; for the triangle this vortex is located in the middle of a side .",
    "thus , as an alternative approach we reinvestigated both samples , now with circular holes , and noticed that qualitatively these results do not differ from the ones with the other shaped holes .",

    "we propose how to engineer the superconducting sample but without taking away the conceptual novelty of the nucleation of the vortex - antivortex pair in a _ homogeneous _ magnetic field , as opposed to the idea of placing e.g. a magnetic dot on top of the sample .",
    "we pursued the idea to introduce holes which will act as pinning centers , and in doing so , pull the vortices away from the anti - vortex and additionally to provide a strong immunity against imperfections and defects .",

    "we determined optimal parameters for the square and triangle geometry .",

    "we investigated the influence of several kinds of geometrical defects on the vav state .",
    "for all the imperfections we studied , we found that the holes cause a substantial increase of the stability of the vav configuration with respect to defects . with the technology which is nowadays available it is possible to manufacture samples with the desired precision to proof the existence of vav states .",
    "the geometry induced antivortices are known to be a consequence of the symmetry of the sample .",
    "therefore , we focussed on the competition of different sources of symmetry in the mesoscopic superconductor .",
    "we concluded that the pinning centers are by far the most efficient in imposing their symmetry , while the role of the outer boundary of the sample has a less determining role .",
    "thinking further on this line , we studied circular disks , perforated by a number of symmetrically placed holes , and found giant antivortices up to a vorticity of -7 .",
    "however , we found that this spectacular configuration , is highly sensitive to imperfections .",
    "the effect of the non - linearity of the first gl equations and the magnetic screening represented by the second gl equation was critically examined , allowing us to investigate the influence of temperature and non - zero thickness of the sample on the vav state .",
    "we constructed phase diagrams for different values of @xmath10 for the perforated and the plain square system showing the stability region of the vav state in the @xmath119 plane .",
    "for low value of @xmath10 the introduction of holes enlarges the stability region .",
    "we also found the remarkable appearance of asymmetric vav states , stable in a wide region of the phase diagram .",
