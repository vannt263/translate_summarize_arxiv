    "despite being studied for many years and in all wavebands , the @xmath0 carinae system ( @xmath0  car ) , best known for its spectacular nebula @xcite that can be tracked back to the great eruption of 1840 @xcite is still much of a mystery .",
    "it is now believed to be a stellar binary system with a period of 5.54 years @xcite .",
    "the primary star is one of the brightest and most massive ( @xmath2 120  @xmath3 ) stars in our galaxy .",
    "the system is currently in a phase of immense mass ejection .",
    "the x - rays detected from @xmath0  car  can be explained by the collision of the two stellar winds @xcite , not so the 70 day x - ray minimum observed periodically around periastron @xcite .",
    "currently , the mass loss rate of the primary exceeds @xmath4@xmath3  yr@xmath1  @xcite and that of the secondary is an order of magnitude lower @xcite , but still unusually high .",
    "the wind of the secondary is much faster ( few 1,000 km  s@xmath1 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than that of the primary ( @xmath2  600 km  s@xmath1  and depending on latitude , * ? ? ?",
    "the x - ray  flux between 2 and 10  kev during the past 12 years is normally at a level of 5@xmath5 erg  s@xmath1  @xmath6 , as expected from the collision of the two stellar winds @xcite .",
    "the x - ray  light curve is roughly constant throughout most of the 5.54 year orbital period , but rises gradually by a factor of 34 upon approach to periastron at which time short flares appear @xcite , before it drops sharply and stays in an x - ray  low state ( @xmath7  20% of normal brightness ) for approximately 70  days .",
    "the full x - ray light curve can be found in @xcite .",
    "although absorption by the dense primary wind may play a certain role in attenuating the x - ray emission from @xmath0  car , both spectral and temporal arguments have been put forward to reject absorption or an eclipse as the prime reason for this persisting low state @xcite , which is unique to @xmath0  car .",
    "recently , it has been proposed that if the binary separation during periastron is small enough , the massive primary wind could smother the secondary wind and thus shut down the x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "however , so far there has been no direct evidence for accretion .    in this work ,",
    "we wish to add to the temporal aspects of the @xmath0  cartale a high - resolution x - ray  spectroscopic dimension .",
    "this is achieved by using five deep exposures of @xmath0  car  with the high energy grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) on board the _ chandra _  x - rayobservatory ( cxo ) , only the first of which has been published @xcite .",
    "theoretical variations of spectral line profiles in binary colliding wind systems have been modeled by @xcite .",
    "the varying line profiles presented here for @xmath0  car , however , do not follow these models , at least not in a straightforward way , as we explain in  3 .",
    "the log of the _ chandra _  observations is given in table  1 .",
    "two observations ( 3745 and 3748 ) coincide with the short intense flares just before periastron .",
    "the exact time of periastron is not well determined and depends on the uncertain orbital parameters of the system .",
    "nonetheless , for the sake of presentation , we assume throughout this paper a period of 5.54  years ( 2024  days ) and set phase zero to be at 2003 - 06 - 29 . the x - ray low state , thus , occurs during phase 0  0.035 .",
    "the data were retrieved from the cxo archive and processed using standard software ( ciao version 3.2.2 . ) .",
    "_ chandra _ s heg and meg ( high and medium energy gratings ) spectrometers operate simultaneously in the 3.5  7.5   band of interest here and their spectra are consistent with each other . aiming at the highest possible kinematic resolution , however , the higher spectral resolving power of the heg in this band ( factor of @xmath2 2 )",
    "is favored over the slightly higher effective area of the meg ( factor of @xmath2 2 ) , especially since the co - added plus and minus 1st order heg data are already of sufficiently high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "to reveal the dynamics of the x - ray  gas , we transferred each spectral line profile to line - of - sight velocity space ( @xmath8 in km  s@xmath1 ) using the simple non - relativistic doppler shift @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent the observed and rest - frame wavelengths of the line , respectively , and @xmath12 is the speed of light .",
    "negative and positive velocities represent approaching and receding gas , respectively .",
    "1 shows the broad and variable x - ray  line profiles observed in @xmath0  car  as demonstrated on the si@xmath13 ly@xmath14 unresolved doublet at 6.18   .",
    "as expected , the meg profile represents a smoothed version of the higher - resolution heg profile . the observed line is much broader than the instrumental line spread function (",
    "also shown ) .",
    "fig .  1 also demonstrates how the line profile varies dramatically from assumed phase @xmath15=  0.470 ( obs .",
    "632 ) to @xmath15=  0.028 ( obs .",
    "the early - phase ( @xmath15=  0.470 ) line is centered around zero velocity with no significant emission beyond 700  km  s@xmath1  ( fwhm  = 1000 @xmath16  100  km  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "the line closer to periastron ( @xmath15=  0.028 ) features high velocity gas up to @xmath22000  km  s@xmath1 . a gaussian fit yields a centroid shift of 550 @xmath16  90  km  s@xmath1 , although the profile is clearly asymmetric .    in each observation ,",
    "the kinematic profiles of all lines are fairly similar .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .  2 , where we present four bright spectral lines from obs .",
    "3745 ( @xmath15= 0.028 ) .",
    "the profiles are unambiguously broad and asymmetric with approaching velocities reaching 2,000  km  s@xmath1 , but with no significant receding emission beyond @xmath2  700  km  s@xmath1 . in order to understand how the line profiles vary between observations and as a function of phase we co - added the profiles of nine bright lines in each observation , namely the ly@xmath14 ( 1s-2p ) , he@xmath14 resonance ( 1s@xmath17 - 1s2p ) and he@xmath14 forbidden ( 1s@xmath17 - 1s2s ) lines of the si , s , and ar ions . since the profiles of all these lines in a given observation are roughly similar ( e.g. , fig .",
    "2 ) , co - adding gives an average profile with improved s / n .",
    "individual fe lines below 2    could not be included in this analysis , despite their high intensity , since the hetgs  resolving power decreases strongly at these low wavelengths to the extent that the he - like fe line complex is unresolved .",
    "the blue wing of the he@xmath14 fe resonance line is consistent with , though not resolved as well as , the other line profiles presented here .",
    "the resulting mean profiles have been normalized ( except for obs .",
    "3747 ) to facilitate the comparison and are presented in fig .",
    "the observed , mean , unnormalized peak intensities for the assumed phases : 0.470 , 0.130 , 0.028 , 0.006 , and + 0.044 are , respectively , 2.0 , 3.9 , 3.9 , 1.9 , and 0.3 , @xmath18  10@xmath19  ph  s@xmath1  @xmath6  @xmath1 .",
    "however , any interpretation of the _ absolute _ line fluxes in terms of the orbital parameters would be risky , as the observed variability is a result of both abrupt flaring and varying absorption",
    ".    a clear trend can be seen in fig .",
    "far from periastron , the line profile is relatively symmetrical and narrow .",
    "closer to periastron , bright components of gas moving towards us at velocities as high as 2,000  km  s@xmath1  start to develop .",
    "as the system further approaches periastron , the outflow dominates the line profile to the point where the bulk of the emission is clearly blue - shifted .",
    "after periastron absorption considerably attenuates the emission lines to the low level seen in fig .  3 .",
    "naive gaussian fits to the first two profiles yield centroids at 25 @xmath16  25  km  s@xmath1  ( for @xmath15=  0.470 ) and at 50 @xmath16  20  km  s@xmath1",
    "( @xmath15=  0.130 ) both with fwhm  = 700 @xmath16  50  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the late - phase asymmetric profiles are non - gaussian . for the mere purpose of quantifying the centroid shift , we performed two - gaussian fits , which yield peaks at 120 @xmath16  50  km  s@xmath1  and 800 @xmath16  100  km  s@xmath1  for @xmath15=  0.028 and at 170 @xmath16  50  km  s@xmath1  and 1000 @xmath16  100  km  s@xmath1  for @xmath15=  0.006 .",
    "it is hard to rule out high - velocity _ receding _ gas before the x - ray  minimum , since in agreement with @xcite , we find that the column density toward the x - ray  source rises from 5@xmath1810@xmath20  @xmath6  long before periastron to 3@xmath1810@xmath21  @xmath6  just after it .",
    "emission from the far side of the system , thus , could be strongly absorbed .",
    "the colliding wind binary model , which is generally accepted for explaining the x - ray  emission of @xmath0  car , has several clear predictions regarding the spectral line profiles expected at different orbital phases .",
    "the doppler shifts are the result of shocked gas flowing along the contact discontinuity ( cd ) surface and away from the stagnation point ( sp ) .",
    "if the shock opening angle is between @xmath22 @xcite , the broadest line profiles are expected when the system is observed perpendicular to the line connecting the two stars , as the hottest gas formed around the sp flows directly towards and away from the observer . in this case , the lines are centered at zero velocity and are intrinsically symmetrical , but could be skewed by absorption of the far ( red ) emission . on the other hand , when the system is observed from behind one of the stars , shifted centroids are expected . if the system is observed from behind the weaker ( stronger ) wind , downstream shocked gas is flowing along the cd surface in the general direction of ( opposite ) the observer , producing blue- ( red- ) shifted centroids .",
    "the maximum velocities in this case would be less than those in the first ( orthogonal ) orientation . for a complete and detailed calculation of line profiles from colliding winds see henley et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . in the following , however , we argue that the current line profiles observed at the different phases of the @xmath0  car  orbit are in contradiction , even qualitatively , with the simple colliding wind scenario .",
    "if the major axis of the @xmath0  car  binary is perpendicular to our line of sight @xcite , the broadest profiles are expected at apastron ( see above ) , but that is when the observed profiles are narrowest ( @xmath23 ) . also , with this geometry , the secondary would have to pass in front of the primary before periastron ( in contrary to the picture of @xcite ) to explain the blue - shifted centroids at @xmath24 , but that would produce symmetrical ( blue - shifted ) profiles as absorption through the secondary wind is weak , while strongly asymmetrical profiles are observed . in any case , the lower velocities observed near apastron appear to rule out this orientation if the colliding wind geometry is to produce the observed x - ray  line profiles .",
    "if alternatively , the projection of the line of sight on the orbital plane is more or less along the major axis and the viewing angle at apastron is from behind the secondary @xcite , the observed blue - shifts at @xmath24 could be ascribed to gas flowing from the sp towards the observer and the unobserved red wing of the line to absorption by the primary wind . however , according to this scenario , at apastron one would expect blue - shifted centroids of at least a few 100  km  s@xmath1  due to downstream gas ( see above ) , which is not observed ( @xmath25 ) . for an observer above the binary plane ( @xmath26 ) , as seems to be the case in @xmath0  car  @xcite , the problem becomes more severe ( higher blue - shift is expected , but not observed ) .    in short ,",
    "the observed behavior of the x - ray  line profiles of @xmath0  carappear qualitatively inconsistent with a naive wind - collision scenario , since the interpretation of the high blue - shifts from a post - shock stream can not be made consistent with all phases .",
    "@xcite , comparing with line profiles calculated from hydrodynamical simulations , also reached the conclusion that the observed profiles are not as expected from simple models of the geometry of the wind - wind collision .",
    "he suggested that including the coriolis effect may bring the models to better agreement with observations .",
    "@xcite suggest the effect of orbital motion , which can account for small centroid shifts , but can not explain the currently observed x - ray  profiles . here , we wish to propose an alternative explanation .",
    "in particular , we note that the asymmetric line profiles are observed during strong peaks in the x - ray light curve .",
    "these peaks too can not be accounted for by the simple colliding wind model @xcite , or by the coriolis force .",
    "we therefore prefer to interpret the observed high - velocity gas up to 2000  km  s@xmath1  in terms of a transient , collimated fast wind , or a jet , ejected from the immediate vicinity of the binary system through the interaction of the two stars .",
    "the peaks in the light curve hint that the outflow may be in the form of blobs .",
    "the unresolved _ chandra _  images and the rapid variations both indicate that the outflow is restricted to within approximately 2@xmath1810@xmath27  cm from the center ( assuming 0.5  at @xmath0  car s distance of 2.3  kpc ) .",
    "the appearance of the same charge states in the spectra attained during all phases implies that the temperatures of the x - ray gas and line - emitting outflow remain in the range of @xmath28  = 2",
    " 5  kev . consequently , we speculate that the fast component of the outflow consists of gas shocked by the collision of the winds ( as observed throughout the orbit ) that is launched and collimated near periastron .",
    "the widths of the major peaks seen in figs .  2 and 3 suggest that the outflow is only moderately collimated to within @xmath29 .",
    "the condensation of shocked gas provides a natural explanation for the rise in x - ray intensity during the short intermittent flares observed in the x - ray light curve .",
    "a collimated outflow from the secondary has also been suggested to explain the enhanced he  ii @xmath30 emission before periastron @xcite .",
    "interestingly , both proper motion and doppler shifts have been measured for high - velocity visible - light knots much further out from the center @xcite .",
    "the optical knots were ejected more than a hundred years ago along the minor axis of the nebula @xcite .",
    "we would expect the present outflow to be launched along the major axis of the nebula although we have no pertinent information on its present direction with respect to the system s geometry .",
    "if indeed that is the case and if the inclination angle of the binary plane to our line of sight is @xmath31 @xcite , the actual outflow velocity would be as high as @xmath22,700  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "as the massive @xmath0  car  primary is a short - lived star shedding considerable mass and as it is now understood that core collapse supernovae can not expel more than a few solar masses , implying that higher mass stars must shed most of their mass prior to the explosion , the winds and fast outflow of @xmath0  car  may be a supernova in the making . at the very least",
    ", it highlights the next periastron passage on 2009 , january 12 as a faithfully scheduled experiment for the astrophysically common , but poorly understood phenomenon of jet launching .",
