    "wave motion in real media differs in many aspects from motion in an idealized elastic medium .",
    "the dispersion and attenuation induced , for instance , by grain - to - grain friction can greatly affect the amplitude of the waves and their arrival times . in the case of small perturbations , linear models of viscoelasticity",
    "provide reasonably accurate means of describing these effects .",
    "viscoelastic constitutive laws give the stress in terms of the past strain rate history .",
    "the aim of this paper is to simulate the propagation and the diffraction of transient viscoelastic waves .",
    "we propose a new approach in three steps :    ( i ) : :    the generalized zener model is used @xcite .",
    "the convolution products    are then replaced by a set of local - in - time differential equations    coupled with the evolution equations of velocity and stress . moreover",
    ",    usual attenuation laws can be approximated closely .",
    "( ii ) : :    the evolution equations are splitted into two parts : a propagative    part , which is solved using a fourth - order finite - difference ader    scheme on a cartesian grid @xcite ; and a diffusive part , which is    solved analytically .",
    "doing so ensures an optimal condition of    stability .",
    "( iii ) : :    the jump conditions along the interfaces are discretized by an    immersed interface method , which introduces a subcell resolution of    the geometry and maintains the convergence rate of the scheme despite    the non - smoothness of the solution .",
    "see @xcite for an overview of    these methods .    the generalized zener model ( i ) has been addressed by various means , such as finite difference methods @xcite , spectral methods @xcite , spectral - element methods @xcite , finite element methods @xcite , to cite only a few . the steps ( ii ) and ( iii ) combine the computational efficiency of cartesian grid methods and an accurate description of the interfaces , as stated in the case of non - dissipative media @xcite and applied to computationally challenging configurations @xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section [ secpb ] ,",
    "the generalized zener model is presented ; the method used to determine its parameters to simulate a given quality factor is also described . in section [ secibvp ] ,",
    "the evolution equations are written in the form of a first - order hyperbolic system with a source term ; the jump conditions along the interfaces are also stated .",
    "the numerical methods used are introduced in section [ secmethods ] , including the numerical scheme and the splitting for the integration of the evolution equations , and the immersed interface method for the discretization of the jump conditions .",
    "numerical experiments are presented in section [ secnum ] in the case of a viscoelastic / fluid interface .",
    "comparisons with analytical solutions are proposed .",
    "a numerical experiment involving multiple scattering in a random medium also confirms the efficiency of the approach .",
    "lastly , the perspectives are discussed in section [ secperspective ] .",
    "in a viscoelastic solid undergoing small perturbations , the stress depends linearly on the history of the past strain rates . in 1d , one writes @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the stress , @xmath2 is the strain , @xmath3 is the displacement , @xmath4 is the relaxation function , and @xmath5 denotes the time convolution .",
    "various models of viscoelasticity can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "the _ maxwell model _ predicts a vanishing asymptotic residual stress .",
    "it therefore appears more appropriate for representing viscoelastic fluids .",
    "the _ kelvin - voigt model _ is computationally advantageous @xcite , but it predicts an unbounded phase velocity as frequency increases . here , we choose the _ generalized zener model _ , which accurately mimics the mechanical behavior of classical viscoelastic media during relaxation experiments : @xmath6 where @xmath7 refers to the heaviside distribution , @xmath8 is the number of relaxation mechanisms , @xmath9 are relaxation frequencies , and the coefficients @xmath10 are strictly positive .",
    "the instantaneous unrelaxed state is denoted by @xmath11 , and at the end of the process , the relaxation function has returned completely to the positive relaxed modulus @xmath12 , where @xmath13 .",
    "the phase velocity increases with the frequency , from @xmath14 at null frequency to @xmath15 at infinite frequency , where @xmath16 is the density @xcite .",
    "let @xmath17 be the fourier transform of a function @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the angular frequency . from ( [ psi ] ) ,",
    "the modulus of viscoelasticity @xmath21 is : @xmath22 and the ratio between the imaginary and real parts of @xmath23 is : @xmath24 the quality factor @xmath25 characterizes the attenuation of the viscoelastic waves .    to determine the @xmath26 coefficients @xmath10 and @xmath9 in ( [ psi ] )",
    ", we choose to minimize the distance between @xmath27 and a given @xmath28 in a band of angular frequencies @xmath29 $ ] . here",
    "we have implemented a classical linear least - squares minimization procedure in the @xmath30 norm @xcite .",
    "relaxation frequencies are distributed linearly on a logarithmic scale of @xmath8 points , ranging from @xmath31 to @xmath32 @xcite @xmath33 the angular frequencies @xmath34 and @xmath35 obviously depend on the spectra of the source .",
    "the coefficients @xmath10 are then obtained by solving the over - determined linear system deduced from ( [ qm1 ] ) @xmath36 where @xmath37 are distributed linearly on a logarithmic scale of @xmath38 points @xmath39 in our numerical experiments , calculations based on ( [ emmerich ] ) have never yielded non - physical negative values of @xmath10 , even with highly attenuating media ( typically @xmath40 ) . if necessary , more sophisticated methods can be applied .",
    "for instance , a nonlinear least - squares constraint optimization was used in @xcite to ensure that the coefficients @xmath10 were positive .",
    "an alternative method of optimization in the norm @xmath41 was presented in @xcite , but this latter method is restricted to materials with constant @xmath42 .    to determine the number of relaxation mechanisms @xmath8 , one can compare @xmath42 and the quality factor @xmath25 deduced from ( [ qm1 ] ) after optimization .",
    "however , the modeling error in the time domain is not easily deduced . a second idea",
    "consists in comparing the transient 1-d analytical solutions associated with @xmath42 and @xmath25 .",
    "these solutions are calculated using classical fourier techniques , which are not described here .      [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the immersed interface method depends on the curvature of the interface and its successive derivatives @xcite . to test the method with a non - null curvature , we now examine a circular interface with a radius of 60 m. the fluid and the viscoelastic medium are outside and inside the circle , respectively .",
    "the incident field is a plane acoustic wave with a horizontal wave vector .",
    "figure [ figtest2 ] shows the field at the initial instant ( a - b ) , after 220 time steps ( c - d ) and after 440 time steps ( e - f ) .",
    "classical conversions and scattering phenomena are observed .",
    "excellent agreement is observed between the numerical and the exact values .",
    "the latter are computed using fourier techniques and decomposing the plane waves on the basis of bessel functions .      in the previous tests ,",
    "the validity of the numerical scheme and the immersed interface method was confirmed in the case of academic configurations .",
    "we now take a complex medium composed of 60 viscoelastic cylinders randomly embedded in water .",
    "the computations are performed on @xmath43 grid nodes .",
    "figure [ figtest3 ] shows the initial field ( a ) and the scattered fields after 2200 time steps ( b ) , when the incident wave has propagated over a distance corresponding to 12 wavelengths .",
    "the propagation of mechanical waves in dissipative solids was addressed numerically in the time domain . to avoid dealing with convolution products ,",
    "memory variables were introduced .",
    "evolution equations were splitted into two parts : the propagative part was solved numerically using a fourth - order scheme for hyperbolic systems ; and the diffusive part was solved exactly .",
    "the jump conditions were discretized by means of an immersed interface method , which introduced a subcell resolution on a cartesian grid . in numerical experiments ,",
    "focus was put on the fluid / viscoelastic interface , but the algorithms have been implemented and tested in many other cases , such as viscoelastic / vacuum and viscoelastic / viscoelastic interfaces .",
    "the numerical methods presented here make it possible to simulate physically relevant numerical experiments , for instance multiple scattering in random media as performed in section [ secnumscatt ] . by applying signal processing tools on the simulated data ,",
    "it is possible to determine the properties of the _ effective medium _ which is equivalent to the disordered medium investigated @xcite .",
    "this numerical approach can be used advantageously instead of the methods usually adopted by physicists so far : real experiments are expensive , and analytical methods can be used only with very small concentrations of scatterers .",
    "the latter limitation is particularly penalizing in the case of concrete , where the concentration of aggregates lies typically around 40% .",
