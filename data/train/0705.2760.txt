    "the products of cascade development do not participate directly , therefore it is safe to assume that the target distribution is mono - energetic , as in the following brief discussion . later the thermal photon spectra is presented along with the kinetic solution .",

    "the total input power spectrum is reprocessed leading to a @xmath0-ray pile up at @xmath10 .",
    "this output spectrum gives total integrated limits on injection energy .",
    "observations of present day fluxes suffer important restrictions from both energy and redshift scales .",
    "cosmological processes that contribute to the egret diffuse flux observations must be significant at @xmath17 .",
    "the significance of any observation of present day cascade radiation processes is highly suppressed by a factor of 1000 .",
    "there are energy loss processes which i have not considered in these calculations . first the synchrotron losses may have unit order corrections on these calculations where large magnetic fields are present .",
