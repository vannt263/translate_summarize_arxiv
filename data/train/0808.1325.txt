    "second , the dominant backgrounds are mis - identifications of either the photon or the @xmath1-quark candidates and mismeasurements of the jet energy which induce @xmath7 not associated with unobserved neutral particles ( fake @xmath7 ) .",

    "the number of events with mis - identified photons is estimated by the `` _ _ ces / cpr method _ _ ''  @xcite , where we use cluster - shape variables from the central electromagnetic strip and wire chamber system ( ces )  @xcite and hit rates in the central preshower detector ( cpr )  @xcite .",

    "a single photon has an average probability of @xmath38 to satisfy a @xmath37 cut , while the background has an average probability of @xmath39 , since the shower profile of the two near - by photons from a meson decay is measurably wider on average . above @xmath40 gev , however , the two photons from @xmath41 decay coalesce and the discrimination power of the shower profile measurement is lost . in this @xmath42 range ,",

    "the weight is a function of the energy of the photon candidate , the angle of incidence , the number of primary interactions found in the event , the shower profile @xmath37 , and whether or not the photon candidate leaves a hit in the preshower detector .",
    "the number of background photons , @xmath45 , is a sum of these weights : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is one or zero depending on if photon candidate @xmath48 satisfies the ces / cpr requirement or not for @xmath49  gev and cpr adc counts above threshold for @xmath50  gev . ] .",
