    "<S> collective excitations in few - atom systems shown initially by kummel et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have been the subject of many theoretical investigations following recent scanning tunneling microscope observations showing development of 1d band structure when the number of atoms in au chains on nial(110 ) exceeds 10 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> many subsequent theoretical calculation@xcite confirmed the presence of the collective plasmon mode in the confined one - dimensional electronic systems of a few atoms . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical studies of plasmon excitations are mostly done via calculating the dipole response @xcite and other characteristic responses @xcite under applying an external field , and the excitations are indicated by the corresponding response resonances . </S>",
    "<S> one may wonder whether the modes predicted in this way are dependent on the applied external fields . </S>",
    "<S> the answer is clearly yes . </S>",
    "<S> it has been demonstrated in ref@xcite that a longitudinal field induces longitudinal - mode plasmon resonance , and a transverse field induces a transverse resonance . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , finding a proper theoretical approach to calculate plasmon spectra is essential for further studies of plasmons in confined electronic systems . in this letter , we attempt to present an eigen equation of electronic collective - oscillation in confined systems , and use the eigen equation to find all plasmon excitations of the systems by solving the equation , and then compare the eigen plasmon excitations with the ones obtained by the way mentioned above to check whether any new collective excitation exists in the systems . consequently , we got a new mode of electronic collective excitations , quadrupole plasmons , in the confined 1d electronic systems . in the 1d systems , the dipole plasmon mode corresponds to the antisymmetric charge oscillation and can be displayed as a resonance of the dipole response@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> distinct from the dipole plasmons , the quadrupole plasmon corresponds to the symmetric charge oscillation and the dipole response vanishing , but can be shown as a resonance of the quadrupole response . </S>",
    "<S> the motion of the electrons in the quadrupole modes is similar to the vibration of atoms in the breathing mode of phonons . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations are done based on the two models : the one - dimensional electron gas and one - dimensional tight - binding models . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown in ref@xcite and present work that the longitudinal dipole - plasmon resonances in linear atomic chains predicted by using a confined 1d electron gas model are qualitatively in agreement with the calculations made for atomic chains by _ </S>",
    "<S> ab initio _ time - dependent density functional theory . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the new mode of collective excitations will exist in the atomic chain systems in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus we expect that this result will prompt theoretical and experimental investigations for finding new modes of plasmon excitations in confined low - dimensional systems , and further affect the future of nanoplasmonic device engineering and nanoscale photochemistry </S>",
    "<S> .    we will start with deducing the plasmon eigen equation , based on the time - dependent density - functional theory ( tddft ) . according to tddft , the induced charge density@xcite@xmath0 where the kohn - sham response function , i.e. , the density - density response function of non - interacting electrons with unperturbed density @xmath1defined by@xmath2(\\mathbf{r},\\omega)}{\\delta v(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime},\\omega)}|_{v[\\rho_{0}]}. \\label{1 - 1}\\ ] ] here we have transformed the time - domain into the frequency - domain . in eq.([1 ] ) , the perturbation potential is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is external potential , and @xmath5 is the induced potential . the time - dependent xc kernel is defined by@xmath6(\\mathbf{r},\\omega)/\\delta\\rho(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime},\\omega).$ ] in fact , the density - density response function defined in eq.([1 - 1 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> is the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) lindhard function@xmath7 where @xmath8 is the fermi - function , @xmath9 is the energy eigen - function of  electrons in the unperturbed system , and @xmath10 is the eigen - energy . </S>",
    "<S> the unperturbed eigenstates can be obtained using local density functional theory . substituting eq.([2 ] ) in eq.([1 ] ) , we have @xmath11   , \\label{8}\\ ] ] where @xmath12combining eq.([8 ] ) with eqs.([4 ] ) , we can obtain the self - consistent equation for @xmath13 @xmath14   , \\label{6}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 multiplying eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 6 ] ) by @xmath16 and integrating over the space yields @xmath17   v_{nm}^{in}(\\omega)=\\sum_{mn}m_{m^{\\prime}n^{\\prime},mn}(\\omega)v_{n , m}^{ex}(\\omega ) , \\label{7}\\ ] ] with@xmath18 now one can calculate the collective charge - oscillation ( eq.([8 ] ) ) by solving eq.([7 ] ) . setting @xmath19 eq.([7 ] ) becomes@xmath17   v_{nm}^{in}(\\omega)=0 . \\label{10}\\ ] ] this is the plasmon eigen - equation we want , and with the equation all the plasmon excitations of a system may be found and are not dependent on the applied external fields . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth to point that using the symmetry of @xmath20 and @xmath21the number of equations in eqs.([7 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) may be reduced . </S>",
    "<S> usually , the eigen states of a confined system may be expressed by real wave - functions , and in this case eqs.([7 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) would be consumedly reduced . according to eigen - equation ( [ 10 ] ) , the plasmon excitation energy @xmath22 can be determined by @xmath23   = 0 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> however , there would be not real solutions due to the finite small imaginary part @xmath24 in the practical calculation a small imaginary part @xmath25  is necessary , and the eigen plasmon excitation energy @xmath22 is obtained by @xmath26=0,$]with @xmath27   \\sim0 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that spectrum function @xmath28   $ ] will show a peak at the plasmon energy @xmath29 here we want to point that the eigen resolution should be exactly real when @xmath30 , and @xmath31 will give an infinite peak at plasmon frequency . </S>",
    "<S> this eigen - equation method not only let us find out all the plasmon modes of a system , but also greatly reduces the amount of computation in comparison with the original tddft .    </S>",
    "<S> firt we study the plasmon excitation in a quasi - one - dimensional electron gas ( q1deg ) confined within a quantum well with length of @xmath32 and width of @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is virtual lattice constant and taken as @xmath35 nm in our calculation . for this model , </S>",
    "<S> the unperturbed wave - function is @xmath36 . with this model </S>",
    "<S> an atomic chain of @xmath37 atoms may be mimicked . </S>",
    "<S> the similar model was employed by gao and yuan@xcite to study the plasmon excitation of a atomic chains . </S>",
    "<S> their calculations indicate that in comparison with the pure rpa the exchange term @xmath38 gives rise to only very slight shift in plasmon frequency . in present work , we are only interested in the qualitative investigation of the plasmon excitation , in particularly finding out all of the collective excitation in the confined systems . therefore </S>",
    "<S> , we will ignore exchange term @xmath38 to simplify our calculation .    </S>",
    "<S> our calculation shows that some plasmon eigen - modes corresponding to the peaks of dipole absorption spectra induced by a local uniform field such as @xmath39@xcite , but for others of the eigen - modes there is not appearance of the absorption - peak . in fig . </S>",

    "<S> in addition , taking @xmath39 as in ref.@xcite , we calculate the dipole strength ( absorption spectrum ) @xmath46dxdy$ ] by using eq.([8 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) , one can find that in the dipole strength functions a peak appears at the same frequency as in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) and ( b ) we show another eigen plasmon excitation around frequency @xmath47 . however , in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) one can find that there is no peak in the dipole response function . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the eigen mode of plasmon shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 can not be excited by this applied external field , or this eigen - mode is not a dipolar plasmon . in addition , we also calculate the induced electric field energy@xcite and the charges @xmath48 as the function of external - field frequency , and find no any resonance to appear at the eigen frequency of 0.5393 . </S>",
    "<S> so , we believe that this excitation mode can not excited with such the applied field .    in order to understand properties of these eigen plasmon excitations and find out why some modes of them can not be excited by the applied field </S>",
    "<S> , we now study the charge distribution in the eigenstates of collective oscillation . by setting @xmath49 </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the charge density @xmath50 of the eigen - states at the eigen - oscillation frequency @xmath51 and @xmath52 and show the results in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) and fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) respectively . </S>",
    "<S> one can find that the charge - distribution of the two plasmon modes are very different . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) , as shown in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , both the real and imaginary profiles of the charge - density distribution are antisymmetric and exhibit likely friedel oscillations across the systems . </S>",
    "<S> however , in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) the charge - density distribution is symmetric , so in this mode of collective excitation the motion of the electrons is similar to the vibration of atoms in the breathing mode of phonons . </S>",
    "<S> it is the symmetric charge - density distribution to cause this mode unable to be excited by a uniform external field , because in this case the electric dipole moment vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetric distribution of charge - density would give rise to a quadrupole moment , corresponding to the quadrupole plasmon mode . </S>",
    "<S> the quadrupole plasmon resonance modes in nanostructures have widely reported@xcite . to the best of our knowledge , however , this type of plasmon excitation has not been reported in the one - dimensional cluster systems . here </S>",
    "<S> , we want to point out that both the asymmetry and symmetry of the charge densities originate from the intrinsic property of the eigenstates , unlike the argument in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that the antisymmetric charge - density results from the antisymmetric external field . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , our calculations show that the plasmon excitations of antisymmetric charge - density can be excited by both external fields @xmath53  and @xmath54 </S>",
    "<S> . however the plasmon excitations of symmetric charge - density can not be excited by @xmath53 , but can be excited by @xmath54 .    for the plasmon excitations of symmetric charge - density , the dipolar moment vanishes , and the interaction energy of the system in uniform applied - field vanishes , so such the mode of plasmons </S>",
    "<S> can not be excited by the uniform field . </S>",
    "<S> however , the symmetric distribution of charge - density gives the quadrupole moment @xmath55 , and the interaction energy of the quadrupole is @xmath55:@xmath56 , therefore we predict that the quadrupole mode of plasmon should be excited by the nonuniform external field . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(a ) and ( b ) we plot the dipole and quadrupole strength as functions of external - field frequency , where the external potentials are @xmath57 and @xmath58 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(a ) and 4(b ) respectively . here </S>",
    "<S> , quadrupole strength is defined as @xmath59dx.$]in the dipole response function , one can find the similar results in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and @xcite , it is that redshifts in energy and its intensity increases with the system length . as was pointed in ref @xcite and @xcite , the increase in intensity results from the accumulation of collectivity in the dipole oscillation . </S>",
    "<S> the redshift of the resonance frequency at increased system length can be understood by the reduction of the energy gaps involved in the dipole excitation . </S>",
    "<S> similar behaviors are also found in the quadrupole functions , and compared with the dipole response function , the main plasmon resonance peaks show general blueshifts for all chain lengths . </S>",
    "<S> however , this does not indicate that the quadrupole plasmon excitations are higher than the dipole plasmons . due to the large difference of strength between the different plasmon resonance peaks , in the plots of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 only the contribution of main plasmon peaks can be shown , and those minor plasmon peaks are invisible . if taking in consideration the minor plasmon peaks , the lowest is quadrupole plasmon excitation . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in the system @xmath60 and @xmath61 the lowest plasmon excitation energy is @xmath62 , which gives a quadrupole plasmon .    </S>",
    "<S> the above investigation is performed based on the model of q1deg . in order to illustrate the generality of the results , we consider the opposite limit case , </S>",
    "<S> namely , we assume that electrons in the atomic chains can be effectively described using a tight - binding model : the extended hubbard model,@xmath63 after a dynamic mean - field approximation , the frequency - dependent charge response is obtained based on the standard linear response theory , @xmath64   \\delta q_{l^{\\prime}}(\\omega)=\\sum_{l^{\\prime}}e^{2}\\pi(l , l^{\\prime},\\omega)\\left [ v_{l}^{ex}(\\omega)\\right ]   , \\label{13}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is charge response on site @xmath66 @xmath67 is the lindhard function , and @xmath68 for  @xmath69 and @xmath70 for  @xmath71 here , @xmath72and @xmath73 following from eq . [ 13 ] , both the eigen plasmon excitations and external field induced resonances can be obtain . qualitatively , the eigen excitations show the same behavior as in the q1deg model , and can be divided into two types of plasmons , i. e. , dipole and quadrupole plasmon . </S>",
    "<S> we show the dipole and quadrupole response functions for different chain - length in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(a ) and 4(b ) respectively , where the energy ( frequency ) is taken the hopping @xmath74 as unit , and @xmath75 .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have presented an eigen - equation method for studying plasmon excitations , which is based on tddft . using the method , we have studied the plasmon excitations in the confined q1deg systems , and predicted a new type of plasmon excitations , i. e. , the quadrupole plasmons , which has not been reported in the one - dimensional systems . </S>",
    "<S> different from the dipole plasmon excitations that correspond to the antisymmetric distribution of induced charge , the new type of plasmons correspond to the symmetric charge distribution , indicating that the motion of charges in this mode of plasmon oscillation is similar to the atomic vibration in the breathing mode of phonons . </S>",
    "<S> since the dipole moment vanishes in the quadrupole mode of plasmons , their excitation only can be achieved  by applying a nonuniform external field , and the quadrupole plasmons may display as the resonance peaks of quadrupole response function . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have shown that the quadrupole plasmon excitations can be predicted in the extended hubbard models . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that this result will prompt theoretical and experimental investigations for finding new modes of plasmon excitations in confined systems , and affect nanoplasmonic device engineering and nanoscale photochemistry .    </S>",
