    "in this paper we bring together two fields , finite type knot theory and goodwillie s calculus of functors , both of which have received considerable attention during the past ten years .",
    "goodwillie and his collaborators have known for some time , through their study of the embedding functor , that there should be a strong connection between the two @xcite .",
    "this is indeed the case , and we will show that a certain tower of spaces in the calculus of embeddings serves as a classifying object for finite type knot invariants .",
    "let @xmath0 be the space of _ framed long knots _ ,",
    "i.e. embeddings of @xmath1 into @xmath2 which agree with some fixed linear inclusion of @xmath1 into @xmath2 outside a compact set , and come equipped with a choice of a nowhere - vanishing section of the normal bundle .",
    "alternatively , we may think of @xmath0 as the space of framed _ based _ knots in @xmath3 , namely framed maps of the unit interval @xmath4 to @xmath3 which are embeddings except at the endpoints .",
    "the endpoints are mapped to some basepoint in @xmath3 with the same derivative .",
    "it is not hard to see that these two versions of @xmath0 are homotopy equivalent .",
    "now consider ( framed ) _ singular _ long knots which are ( framed ) long knots with a finite number of transverse double points .",
    "we can extend any knot invariant @xmath5 to such knots by applying it to all knots obtained by resolving the double points of a singular knot in two possible ways , with appropriate signs .",
    "if @xmath5 vanishes on knots with more than @xmath6 double points , then it is of _ type @xmath6_.    as will be explained in more detail in ",
    "[ s : fintypeinv s ] , it turns out that @xmath7 , the set of all type @xmath6 invariants , is closely related to the space generated by chord diagrams with @xmath6 chords modulo a certain relation .",
    "in fact , if @xmath8 denotes the dual of this space , then kontsevich @xcite proves    [ t : kontsevich ] @xmath9    an alternative proof of this theorem uses bott - taubes configuration space integrals which play a crucial role in the proofs of our results .",
    "these are briefly described in  [ s : b - tintegrals ] , but more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the other ingredient we need is the _ taylor tower for @xmath0 _ defined in some detail in ",
    "[ s : taylortower ] .",
    "following work of weiss @xcite , one can construct spaces @xmath10 for each @xmath11 , defined as homotopy limits of certain diagrams of `` punctured knots , '' namely embeddings of @xmath4 in @xmath3 as before but with some number of subintervals removed .",
    "there are canonical maps @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and these combine to yield the taylor tower .    to study the tower , we introduce in ",
    "[ s : cosimplicialmodel ] a cosimplicial space @xmath14 whose @xmath15th partial totalization is precisely the stage @xmath10 ( theorem  [ t : tot = holim ] ) .",
    "this equivalence was shown by sinha @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the cosimplicial point of view is that @xmath14 comes equipped with a ( second quadrant ) cohomology spectral sequence .",
    "this spectral sequence computes the cohomology of the total complex @xmath16 of the double complex obtained by applying cochains to the truncated cosimplicial space .",
    "alternatively , one can pass to real linear combinations generated by the spaces in the cosimplicial space and take the @xmath15th partial totalization to get @xmath16 again .",
    "it is the latter description of this algebraic analog of the taylor tower that we use for our proofs ( see  [ s : totmapstofintype ] for exact description of the stages @xmath16 ) , because sums of resolutions of singular knots can be mapped into such a tower .",
    "we can now state the main result :    [ t : intromaintheorem1 ] @xmath17    moreover , all finite type invariants factor through the algebraic taylor tower for @xmath0 , as the above isomorphism is induced by a map which is essentially a collection of evaluation maps ( see proposition  [ p : evmapstotot ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , it is not known that the algebraic stages and ordinary stages of the taylor tower have the same homology , although this is believed to be the case ( sinha @xcite has shown this for any space of embeddings of one manifold in another , as long as the codimension is at least 3 ) .",
    "the starting point in the proof of the above theorem is proposition  [ p : cd ] , which states that the groups on the diagonal of the @xmath18 term of the spectral sequence can be associated to chord diagrams .",
    "we then show    * @xmath19  (  [ s : isos&surjsintower ] ) , * @xmath20  ( proposition  [ p : e2 ] ) , * there is a commutative diagram @xmath21 \\ar@{^{(}->}[d ] & { { \\mathcal{v}}}_{n}/{{\\mathcal{v}}}_{n-1 } \\ar@{^{(}->}[d ]   \\\\",
    "e^{-2n , 2n}_{2 } \\ar[r]^{\\cong } & { { \\mathcal{w}}}_{n}}\\ ] ] ( proposition  [ p : totmapstofintype ] ) .",
    "the proof of the first statement is a direct computation of the first differential in the spectral sequence .",
    "the other parts follow from considering how a singular knot maps into the algebraic taylor tower .",
    "we then use theorem  [ t : b - tmaintheorem ] to finish the proofs in  [ s : universality ] .",
    "this theorem essentially states that bott - taubes integration fits as a diagonal map from @xmath8 to @xmath22 in the above square and makes the top resulting triangle commute .",
    "it follows that all the maps in the diagram are isomorphisms over the rationals ( bott - taubes integrals are the only reason we can not state our results over the integers ) .",
    "in addition to deducing theorem  [ t : intromaintheorem1 ] , we also have an alternative proof of theorem  [ t : kontsevich ] , as well as    [ t : collapse ] the spectral sequence collapses on the diagonal at @xmath23 .",
    "thus calculus of the embedding functor provides a new point of view on finite type knot theory .",
    "some further questions as well as a brief discussion of the potential importance of this point of view can be found in  [ s : future ] .",
    "i am deeply endebted to my thesis advisor , tom goodwillie , whose knowledge is only matched by his desire to share it .",
    "dev sinha s help over the years has also been invaluable .",
    "i am thankful to pascal lambrechts and greg arone for many comments and suggestions .",
    "here we recall some basic features of finite type knot theory .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .    as mentioned earlier , a _ singular long knot _ is a long knot except for a finite number of double points .",
    "the tangent vectors at the double points are required to be independent . a knot with @xmath6 such self - intersections",
    "is called _ @xmath6-singular_.    one can now use the _ vassiliev skein relation _ , pictured in figure [ f : vassilievskein ] , to extend any knot invariant @xmath5 to singular knots .",
    "the drawings mean that the three knots only differ locally in one crossing .",
    "a @xmath6-singular knot thus produces @xmath24 resolutions .",
    "the sign convention ensures that the order in which we resolve the singularities does not matter .",
    "[ d : finitetypeinvariant ] @xmath5 is a _ ( finite , or vassiliev ) type @xmath6 invariant _ if it vanishes identically on singular knots with @xmath25 self - intersections .",
    "let @xmath26 be the collection of all finite type invariants and let @xmath7 be the set of type @xmath6 invariants .",
    "it is easy to see , for example , that @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( for unframed knots ) both contain only the constant functions on @xmath0 .",
    "also immediate is that @xmath7 contains @xmath29 .",
    "another quick consequence of the definition is that the value of a type @xmath6 invariant on an @xmath6-singular knot only depends on the placement of its singularities .",
    "this is because if two @xmath6-singular knots differ only in the embedding , the difference of @xmath30 evaluated on one and the other is the value of @xmath5 on some @xmath31-singular knots ( since one can get from one knot to the other by a sequence of crossing changes ) . but",
    "@xmath5 by definition vanishes on such knots .",
    "it thus follows that the value of @xmath5 on @xmath6-singular knots is closely related to the following objects :    a _ chord diagram of degree @xmath6 _ is an oriented interval with @xmath32 paired - off points on it , regarded up to orientation - preserving diffeomorphisms of the interval .",
    "the pairs of points can be thought of as prescriptions for where the singularities on the knot should occur , while how the rest of the interval is embedded is immaterial .",
    "let @xmath33 be the set of all chord diagrams with @xmath6 chords . if @xmath34 is an element of @xmath33 , and if @xmath35 is any @xmath6-singular knot with singularities as prescribed by @xmath34 , by observations above we have a map @xmath36\\to{{\\mathbb r}}\\}\\ ] ] given by @xmath37 and extending linearly .",
    "the kernel is by definition @xmath29 .",
    "now let @xmath38/4t$ ] , where @xmath39 ( or _ four - term _ ) relation is given in figure [ f:4 t ] .",
    "the diagrams differ only in chords indicated ; there may be more chords with their endpoints on the dotted segments , but they are the same for all four diagrams .",
    "this is a natural relation to impose since it simply reflects the fact that moving a strand of an @xmath40-singular knot around one of the singularities gets us back to the original position while introducing four @xmath6-singular knots on its circular route .    in most literature on finite type theory ,",
    "one more relation besides the @xmath39 is imposed .",
    "this @xmath41 ( _ one - term ) relation _ sets the value of any weight system on a chord diagram with an _ isolated chord _ ,",
    "i.e. a chord not intersected by any other chords , to be zero",
    ". however , since we will be considering framed knots , the @xmath41 relation can not be imposed .",
    "this is because the two resolutions of a singularity coming from an isolated chord are _ not framed isotopic_. the consequence of having to consider framed knots is simply that the number of finite type invariants is somewhat larger .",
    "one now gets a genuine type 1 invariant , the framing number .",
    "the @xmath6th power of the framing number as well as its product with any type @xmath42 invariant give additional type @xmath6 invariants .",
    "let @xmath8 , the space of _ weight systems of degree @xmath6 _ , be the dual of @xmath43 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath8 is all there is to the image of the map in .",
    "as stated in introduction , we have the following important theorem due to kontsevich @xcite :    @xmath9    the inverse of the map in ( [ e : easymap ] ) is given by the famous _ kontsevich integral _",
    ", so it is an example of a _ universal finite type invariant_. alternatively , one can use bott - taubes configuration space integrals which we describe in the next section .",
    "what follows is a brief outline of how configuration space integrals can be used to produce a universal finite type invariant .",
    "the integration techniques mentioned here first arose in chern - simons perturbation theory ( see @xcite for the history of the theory ) , but bott and taubes @xcite were first to present and develop the configuration space integrals in a physics - free way .    generalizing the computation of the linking number , they consider configurations of @xmath32 points on a knot and use a labeled chord diagram @xmath34 as a prescription for constructing @xmath6 maps to the product of 2-spheres .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath44 denote the configuration space of @xmath45 ordered points in a manifold @xmath46 : @xmath47 let @xmath48 be a knot . given a configuration in @xmath49 , @xmath48 can be evaluated on the @xmath32 points to yield a configuration in @xmath50 .",
    "we denote this map by @xmath51 .",
    "now let @xmath52 and @xmath53 be two points in the image of @xmath51 whose counterparts , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , are two vertices connected by a chord in @xmath34 .",
    "the composition of interest is then @xmath56^(0.55){ev_k } & f(2n,{{\\mathbb r}}^{3 } ) \\ar[rr]^(0.55){\\frac{p_{j}-p_{i}}{|p_{j}-p_{i}| } } & & s^{2}. } \\ ] ] there are as many maps to @xmath57 as there are chords in @xmath34 . their product can be used for pulling back @xmath6 standard unit volume forms from the product of spheres to @xmath58 .",
    "if one started with two disjoint knots and a configuration space of one point on each of them , the pushforward of the resulting form to the space of disjoint embeddings of two circles would then yield an invariant of 2-component links , the linking number .",
    "however , the situation for one knot is not as simple .",
    "the configuration space @xmath49 is not compact , so that the pushforward to @xmath0 may not converge .",
    "what is required , as it turns out , is a useful compactification of the configuration spaces appearing in .",
    "the first construction of the correct compactification is due to fulton and macpherson @xcite ( bott and taubes use a modification by axelrod and singer @xcite ) . at the heart of this compactification is the blowup along each diagonal of the ordered product of @xmath45 copies of @xmath46 .",
    "however , we give here an alternative definition due to sinha @xcite which does not involve blowups and is thus perhaps more accessible .",
    "assuming @xmath46 is embedded in a euclidean space of dimension @xmath59 , let @xmath54 be the inclusion of @xmath44 in @xmath60 , @xmath61 the map to @xmath62 given by the normalized difference of points @xmath53 and @xmath52 , and @xmath63 the map to @xmath64 $ ] given by @xmath65 .",
    "[ d : devcompactification ] let @xmath66}$ ] be the closure of the image of @xmath44 in @xmath67^{k\\choose 3}$ ] under the map @xmath68 .",
    "this compactification is a stratified manifold ( manifold with corners ) , whose stratification is determined by the rates at which configuration points are approaching each other .",
    "in particular , a point in a codimension one stratum is determined by some number of configuration points colliding at the same time .",
    "the most useful feature of this construction is that the directions of approach of the colliding points are kept track of .",
    "this allows bott and taubes to rewrite as @xmath69}\\times{{\\mathcal{k}}}\\longrightarrow { f[2n , { { \\mathbb r}}^{3}]}\\longrightarrow s^{2}\\ ] ] and they show that the product of the 2-forms which are pulled back from the spheres extends smoothly to the boundary of @xmath70}$ ] ( for details , also see @xcite ) .",
    "the advantage is that now one can produce a function on the space of knots @xmath0 by integrating the resulting @xmath32-form along the compact fiber @xmath70}$ ] of the projection @xmath71}\\times { { \\mathcal{k}}}\\longrightarrow{{\\mathcal{k}}}.\\ ] ] more precisely , let @xmath72 be the product of the volume forms on @xmath73 and let @xmath74 be the product of the compositions in .",
    "what has just been described is a function on @xmath0 , which we denote by @xmath75 , given by @xmath76 the question now is whether @xmath75 is a closed 0-form , or a knot invariant . to check this",
    ", it suffices by stokes theorem to examine the pushforward @xmath77 along the codimension one faces of @xmath70}$ ] .",
    "if the integrals vanish on every such face , yields a knot invariant .",
    "this , however , turns out to be too much to hope for .",
    "the boundary integrals along some of the faces are nonzero , and one is next lead to consider other terms to counter their contribution .",
    "the correct setting for doing so is provided by first extending the chord diagrams to _",
    "trivalent diagrams_. in addition to chords on the circle , such diagrams have some number of edges ending in triples at vertices off the circle .",
    "the diagrams are oriented by one of the two cyclic orientations of the edges emanating from the trivalent vertices ( see definition 1.8 in @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath78 be the set of trivalent diagrams with @xmath32 vertices . also consider the @xmath79 relation in figure [ f : stu ] .",
    "bar - natan uses the fact that the @xmath39 relation looks like a difference of two such relations to prove    the real vector space generated by trivalent diagrams with @xmath32 vertices modulo the @xmath79 relation is isomorphic to @xmath43 .",
    "the weight systems now extend uniquely to trivalent diagrams modulo @xmath79 .    given a trivalent diagram with @xmath32 vertices , @xmath45",
    "of which are on the circle and @xmath80 are trivalent , bott and taubes now construct a @xmath81-dimensional space @xmath82 $ ] which fibers over @xmath0 with fiber a configuration space of @xmath32 points in @xmath2 with the condition that @xmath45 of these points are constrained to lie on a given knot @xmath48 .",
    "fulton - macpherson compactification may be carried out for these spaces as well .",
    "since trivalent diagrams are generalizations of chord diagrams , @xmath83 $ ] reduces to @xmath84}\\times { { \\mathcal{k}}}$ ] when @xmath85 .",
    "so now trivalent diagrams @xmath34 become prescriptions for pulling back 2-forms from products of spheres .",
    "each chord and edge of @xmath34 again determines a map to @xmath86 via the normalized difference of the appropriate two points in @xmath83 $ ] , and each map is used to pull back a volume form from a sphere . as described in @xcite , the resulting form pulled back by the product of all the maps extends smoothly to the codimension one strata of @xmath83 $ ] . since @xmath34 has @xmath87 chords and edges , the resulting form on @xmath83 $ ] is @xmath81-dimensional .",
    "its pushforward thus again yields a function on @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath75 denote the pullback followed by pushforward as before , only now @xmath34 could also be a trivalent diagram .",
    "the following theorem was proved by altschuler and freidel @xcite , while a different partial proof was given by d. thurston @xcite following the work of bar - natan and bott - taubes ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "[ t : universalinvariant ] let @xmath88 be a weight system in @xmath8 .",
    "the sum of @xmath75 with coefficients @xmath89 , taken over all trivalent diagrams @xmath34 with @xmath32 vertices and with a certain correction term for each @xmath34 , is a knot invariant .",
    "further , when @xmath75 is extended to sums of resolutions of singular knots , it gives a universal type @xmath6 invariant .",
    "the proof is a combination of arguments showing that the integrals along the various faces of @xmath83 $ ] either vanish , cancel due to the relations imposed on trivalent diagrams , or can be compensated for by other integrals .",
    "next we will see how this theorem extends to the stages of the taylor tower for @xmath0 .",
    "building on general theory of calculus of functors developed by goodwillie @xcite , weiss develops in @xcite ( also see @xcite ) a certain tower for studying the space of embeddings of one manifold in another .",
    "the stages of the tower in some sense approximate the original space of embeddings as long as the codimension of one manifold in the other is at least three .",
    "this is of course not true in our situation , but the tower for @xmath0 can still be constructed as outlined below .",
    "more on this construction for the particular case of spaces of knots can be found in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath90 , @xmath91 , be a collection of disjoint closed subintervals of @xmath4 not containing the endpoints , and define spaces of `` punctured knots '' @xmath92 for each nonempty subset @xmath93 of @xmath94 . here",
    "we as usual mean that the endpoints of the interval are sent to some basepoint in @xmath3 with the same derivative while the other pieces of @xmath4 are embedded .",
    "these spaces can be arranged in a subcubical diagram ( like a cubical diagram , but missing a space which maps to all others ) , which we will call @xmath95 , since every punctured knot restricts to a knot with more punctures .",
    "thus , for example , if @xmath96 , we have a 3-subcubical diagram @xmath97 @xmath98[dd ]            \\ar[dr ]   &                   \\\\            &   e_{\\{2\\ } } \\ar[rr ] \\ar[dd ]   &            & e_{\\{1,2\\ } }            \\ar[dd ] \\\\",

    ".    now let @xmath99 be the face of @xmath100 for which those barycentric coordinates indexed by elements of @xmath101 which are not in the subset @xmath93 are 0 .",
    "recall that the _ homotopy limit _ of @xmath95 , which we will denote by @xmath102 , can then be defined as the subspace of @xmath103 consisting of collections of maps @xmath104 such that , for every map @xmath105 in the diagram , the square @xmath106^{\\alpha_{s } } \\ar@{^{(}->}[d ] & e_{s } \\ar[d ] \\\\",
    "\\delta^{s\\cup\\{i\\ } } \\ar[r]^{\\alpha_{s\\cup \\{i\\ } } }    &    e_{s\\cup \\{i\\ } } } \\ ] ] commutes .",
    "( more on homotopy limits of diagrams of spaces can be found in @xcite . )",
    "two observations are immediate : any knot can be restricted to a knot with punctures , so that @xmath0 maps to the subcubical diagram ( in fact , @xmath0 is also the actual limit of the subcubical diagram , as long as @xmath107 )",
    ". consequently , there are canonical maps @xmath108 also , the subcubical diagram for knots with up to @xmath15 punctures is contained in the diagram for knots with up to @xmath109 punctures , so that there are also projections @xmath110    the _ taylor tower for @xmath0 _ is the collection of maps @xmath111 &   { { \\mathcal{h}}}_{r-1}\\ar[l ] & { { \\mathcal{h}}}_{r}\\ar[l ] & \\cdots\\ar[l ] } .\\ ] ] spaces @xmath10 will be called the _ stages _ of the tower .    in the most general setting , the taylor tower is constructed from embeddings of codimension zero submanifolds of one manifold in another . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "if the codimension is at least three , goodwillie , klein , and weiss @xcite show that the maps from the original space of embeddings to stages of the tower induce more isomorphisms on homotopy and homology groups the higher one goes in the tower .",
    "consequently , the inverse limit of the tower is weakly equivalent to the original space of embeddings . in particular ,",
    "this fact has been used for studying the homology and homotopy of spaces of knots in @xmath112 , @xmath113 @xcite .    in @xcite",

    "we integrate over certain spaces which generalize @xmath83 $ ] .",

    "the important feature is that @xmath325 has the same cohomology as @xmath317 .",

    "but this is not an element in the basis of @xmath402 , and it can be rewritten as @xmath415 , where @xmath416 contains @xmath404 .",
    "note that the four forms @xmath417 only differ in the two factors as indicated .",
    "similarly , in the second case of a possible repeated index in @xmath342 , we again get four basis elements @xmath417 with @xmath412 and @xmath413 the same as above , and with @xmath418 giving @xmath342 via @xmath419 .",
    "let @xmath420 be dual to the elements @xmath421 .",
    "we have thus shown that there are exactly four elements @xmath422 whose @xmath378 , evaluated on @xmath362 is nonzero .",
    "more precisely , @xmath423 the signs depend on which index in @xmath362 is repeated ( as @xmath378 is an alternating sum ) , as well as indices @xmath424 and @xmath120 ( the number of transpositions needed to get from one labeling to another has to be taken into account ) .",

    "thus we get that , if @xmath280 is thought of as a function on @xmath33 , then @xmath433        an immediate consequence is that we can construct an algebraic analog of @xmath298 , called @xmath16 , as follows : we truncate @xmath14 at the @xmath15th space for any @xmath15 , and then construct the double cochain complex ( now finite in the horizontal direction ) and the associated spectral sequence .",
    "letting @xmath16 be the total complex of this double complex , the spectral sequence would now be computing the cohomology of @xmath16 .",

    ", there would be no new differentials coming into the diagonal of the spectral sequence in passing from the truncation of @xmath14 at @xmath15 to @xmath109 .",
    "since every odd entry on the diagonal at the @xmath23 term is 0 , we conclude @xmath441 we can put together the above isomorphisms ( the second giving an injection from @xmath442 to @xmath443 ) into a tower of invariants of partial totalizations which we call a _ taylor cotower _ :        going from partial totalizations @xmath447 to total complexes @xmath448 is also possible directly from the subcubical diagrams of configuration spaces .",
    "we have bypassed this by working with @xmath14 instead , but we could have also considered cochains on all spaces of punctured embeddings in the subcubical diagram ( all arrows would now get reversed ) and then formed the homotopy colimit @xmath449 ( dual to the homotopy limit , but now in an algebraic sense ) . a double complex @xmath16 could then be formed by collecting all cochains on embeddings with the same number of punctures .",

    "but we also know that there is an equivalence @xmath492 in particular , putting , , and together on @xmath233 , we have @xmath493 since the tower had @xmath494 as its stages , we can now replace them by @xmath495 .",
    "the idea will be that an @xmath6-singular knot maps to @xmath496 via the evaluation map , but the map is homotopic to 0 .",
    "however , the homotopy can not be extended to @xmath497 and the obstruction to doing so is precisely the chord diagram associated to the singular knot .",

    "the fact that there are always fewer @xmath504 than @xmath432 and @xmath505 is crucial in what follows .",
    "now pick closed intervals @xmath506 , @xmath507 around the points @xmath508 , @xmath509",
    "so that the @xmath24 resolutions of @xmath48 differ only in the @xmath510 . let the resolutions be indexed by the subsets @xmath93 of @xmath511 in the sense that if @xmath512 , then @xmath510 was changed into an overstrand ( in the vassiliev skein relation ) .",
    "it is clear how to extend @xmath513 to linear combinations of knots and get a map @xmath514 in particular , we can map sums of resolutions @xmath515 ( taken with appropriate signs ) of an @xmath6-singular knot .",
    "let @xmath516 and define a homotopy ( parametrized by @xmath517 ) @xmath518 note that this homotopy is only defined on @xmath506 and has the effect of changing an overcrossing to an undercrossing .",
    "the problem is that , for some time @xmath517 , this homotopy reintroduces the original singularity on the resolved knot .",
    "this means that @xmath513 will yield a degenerate configuration if any two of the @xmath504 equal @xmath508 and @xmath509 .    to avoid this",
    ", it suffices to modify the homotopy so that no movement takes place when there is some @xmath519 which equals @xmath509 . to do this ,",
    "define a map @xmath520\\ ] ] by @xmath521 then @xmath522 is a continuous map which is 0 if , for any @xmath54 , @xmath523 and 1 if , for all @xmath54 , @xmath524 .",
    "thus @xmath526 changes overcrossing @xmath527 to undercrossing @xmath528 if no @xmath504 is in @xmath507 .",
    "if some @xmath504 enters @xmath507 , the homotopy happens only part of the way . if any @xmath504 comes to the center of @xmath507 and thus equals @xmath509 , the homotopy is just constant .",
    "this setup then prevents the collision of configuration points in @xmath529 so that it makes sense to use @xmath513 to define a homotopy @xmath530 by @xmath531 adding over all @xmath532 with appropriate signs , we get a homotopy @xmath533 we wish for this homotopy to be 0 when @xmath534 .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that , for every @xmath515 and every @xmath45 , there exists a @xmath535 such that @xmath536 and @xmath537 differ only in those @xmath504 which are in @xmath506 , and these two configurations have opposite signs .",
    "then @xmath542 is the same configuration for all @xmath93 and for all @xmath517 , and these cancel out in @xmath543 .",
    "note that this happens regardless of whether @xmath507 contains any of the @xmath504 or not .",
    "since @xmath507 is free of the @xmath548 , @xmath549 moves the overstrand @xmath527 to the understrand @xmath527 without introducing a singularity .",
    "so now the two resolutions are the same and they cancel because of the difference in signs .",
    "since all the resolutions can be combined in pairs which only differ in one crossing , everything adds up to 0 .      in this case , the homotopy @xmath549 does not change the overcrossing to the undercrossing ( it might perform a part of the movement , depending on where exactly @xmath548 is in @xmath507it is important here that this partial movement happens on half the resolutions which will pair up and cancel , as will the other half ) .",
    "but since @xmath503 , there must be an interval , either @xmath552 or @xmath553 , which is free of all the @xmath554 .",
    "this puts us back into one of the previous cases , with @xmath555 .",
    "everything cancels in pairs again .",
    "we still need this to be a homotopy in @xmath496 , so that we need to check the compatibility with coface and codegeneracy maps in @xmath14 .",
    "this , however , is immediate from the definition of @xmath522 and we omit the details .",
    "therefore @xmath559 is 0 on @xmath6-singular knots .",
    "if we try to apply the same construction to @xmath497 , we will get 0 at @xmath534 if @xmath503 , but case 2b now breaks down when @xmath560 .",
    "this is because the @xmath504 could land in _ all _ @xmath506 and @xmath507 .",
    "part of the homotopy might still take place ( depending on exactly where the @xmath504 are in those intervals ) , but there will be no cancelations among the configurations .",
    "we distinguish an extreme case which will be needed later , namely let @xmath561 however , since @xmath549 still produces 0 outside of @xmath562 we have , at @xmath534 , a map @xmath563 which takes everything outside of @xmath564 to 0 .",
    "in particular , the boundary of @xmath565 goes to 0 , so we in fact have a map @xmath566 or an element of @xmath567 to see which element this is , we turn to cohomology :    since @xmath568 is the configuration space @xmath569 , we in fact have a map @xmath570 and various maps @xmath571 given by the normalized difference of two points in the configuration .",
    "since we are looking for an element of @xmath572 , we take @xmath6 such maps to pull back a @xmath32-form from a product of @xmath6 spheres .",
    "now remember that @xmath564 is a product of @xmath32 disjoint intervals , so that the composition @xmath573 breaks up as @xmath6 maps @xmath574 but the boundary of each of these squares maps to 0 , so we actually have @xmath6 maps from @xmath86 to @xmath575 every such map is determined up to homotopy by its degree .",
    "we will therefore first pick a point @xmath576 in @xmath73 which is a regular value for the composition @xmath577 but since the linear combination of knots is here given by the resolutions of an @xmath6-singular knot , we may pick a point which is a regular value for @xmath578 for all resolutions @xmath93 .",
    "then we will count the number of preimages of this regular value over all @xmath93 and all possible vectors between points in the configuration lying in the images of intervals @xmath506 and @xmath507 .",
    "this will give an element of @xmath579 whose dual is precisely the element which prevents the extension of the homotopy to @xmath497 .",
    "let @xmath580 and choose @xmath581 such that @xmath582 is the ( normalized ) vector which points from @xmath583 to @xmath584 .",
    "then the only time the map @xmath585 produces this value is when @xmath586 .",
    "also , this value occurs only once over all the resolutions , and that is when the singular knot is resolved positively at all the singularities ( so @xmath510 is always the overstrand ) .",
    "other simple geometric considerations show that this is the only preimage .",
    "we may thus think of the cohomology class we obtain as represented by @xmath6 vectors pointing from the images of the @xmath432 to the images of the @xmath505 .",
    "but then the dual class may be represented by a chord diagram which is precisely the diagram associated to the @xmath6-singular knot we started with .",
    "finally note that @xmath587 is 0 for any singular knot with @xmath6 or more singularities , but it is not 0 on knots with @xmath42 singularities ( repeat the arguments with a shift  the key is that we now would not have @xmath588 for all @xmath55 ) .",
    "we can now collect all the information and prove the proposition as stated : let @xmath589 & = \\{\\text{homotopy classes of combinations of elements of $ \\overline{{{\\mathcal{k}}}}_{n}$}\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that there is a filtration @xmath590\\supset \\cdots \\supset [ { { \\mathbb r}}\\overline{{{\\mathcal{k}}}}_{n } ] \\supset [ { { \\mathbb r}}\\overline{{{\\mathcal{k}}}}_{n+1 } ] \\supset \\cdots\\ ] ] since every @xmath31-singular knot resolves into two @xmath6-singular ones .",
