    "subsequent high - resolution @xmath9co(j=1 - 0 ) observations near the center of the cloud have shown that the infrared point source iras04325 - 1419 corresponding to one of the binaries is associated with a red and blue - shifted bipolar outflow ( liljestrm et al .",

    "the distances are also consistent with previous distance estimates ( see sect .  [ previous ] ) .    since mbm12 and mbm20 are both star forming clouds which are probably located within or at the edge of the local bubble , determining an accurate distance to these clouds is important for studies of stars and of the interstellar medium .",
    "in addition , observations of mbm12 are already scheduled for _ xmm _ ( 50 ks ) and _ chandra _ ( 100 ks ) to investigate the diffuse x - ray emission of the local bubble .",

    "was known via its _ spectroscopic _ parallax , the distance to the cloud could be determined .",
    "the stars with interstellar absorption features were presumed to be behind the cloud and those without interstellar features were presumed to be in front of the cloud or not located behind a sufficient column density to detect the interstellar line . since the _ hipparcos _ satellite measured the _ trigonometric _ parallax for most of the stars used to determine the distance to mbm12 and mbm20 , it is no longer necessary to assume a spectral type or intrinsic luminosity ( as is necessary for a spectroscopic parallax ) to measure their distance .",

    "( 1986 ) found that the star hd18404 ( distance @xmath0  60  pc ) showed no interstellar absorption features and is therefore presumably in front of the cloud and the star hd18519/20 ( distance @xmath0  70  pc ) did show interstellar absorption features and is therefore behind the cloud . according to _ hipparcos",
    "_ , the distance to hd18404 is @xmath0  32@xmath31  pc and the distance to hd18519/20 is @xmath0  90@xmath312  pc .",

    "hobbs et al .  ( 1986 ) note that it remains possible , although unlikely , that a cloud is located in the foreground of a more distant co cloud at virtually the same radial velocity .",
    "therefore it is important to note that there are at least two stars located behind the cloud which show a large extinction ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "however , both of these stars are too faint to have been observed with _",

    "in addition , hearty et al .  ( 2000 ) showed that the optical spectrum of another star , dc48 ( duerr & craine 1982 ) , corresponds to a g9 star .",
    "comparing the magnitude and color measured by duerr & craine ( 1982 ) for this star ( @xmath21 = 18.7 and v - i = 5.6  mag ) to the intrinsic values of a g9 star , it could be a main sequence star with @xmath20 @xmath0 8.9 mag at a distance of @xmath0 63  pc or a giant star with @xmath20 @xmath0 8.4 mag at a distance of @xmath0 950  pc .",
    "future observations to better constrain the distance , the luminosity class , and the spectral type of this star may prove that the co and the clouds along this line of sight are one and the same and provide a new upper limit on the distance to mbm12 .",
    "the cloud mbm20 is located southwest of several cometary globules probably associated with the orion star forming region . however , previous photometric and spectroscopic observations of mbm20 and the morphology of the cometary globules suggest that mbm20 is much closer to the sun than the cometary globules in the region",
    ". studies of star formation in bok globules in the gum nebula have identified bok globules with comet - like tails pointed away from the central ob association ( e.g. , reipurth 1983 ) .",
    "this type of large scale morphology which bally et al .",
    "( 1991 ) argue is caused by the energy injected from massive stars can also be seen in the cometary clouds surrounding the orion ob association where many clouds have dense heads with tails pointing away from the center of the orion ob association .",
    "whatever the mechanisms are that generate the cometary clouds , there are no signs that mbm20 is interacting with the bright stars in orion ( i.e. , there is no cometary tail pointed away from the ob association ) .",
    "magnani & de vries ( 1986 ) used star counts to estimate an upper limit for the distance to this cloud to be @xmath0  125  pc .",
    "more recently , penprase ( 1992 ) derived a photometric distance , @xmath13 , to mbm20 of @xmath22 pc .    using the same technique we use in this paper , penprase ( 1993 ) arrived at an upper limit for the distance to mbm20 ( @xmath0  110  pc ) by observing d interstellar absorption features is stars for which a spectroscopic parallax could be determined ( cf .",
    "hobbs et al . 1986 ) .",
    "the nearest star which showed interstellar absorption , hd29851 , is at a distance of 110  pc based on its spectroscopic parallax .",
    "since none of the stars observed by penprase ( 1993 ) were superimposed on the cloud contours , a lower limit for the distance to the cloud could not be determined . however , even without a lower limit on the distance , these observations showed that mbm20 is among the nearest star forming molecular clouds to the sun .",
    "the _ hipparcos _",
