    "using the ctio 0.9-m telescope , we have made astrometric observations of more than 700 nearby stars since 1999 during our cerro tololo inter - american observatory parallax investigation ( ctiopi ) .",
    "we have presented nearby subdwarf , red dwarf , and white dwarf discoveries in _ the solar neighborhood _ series @xcite , as part of the recons ( research consortium on nearby stars ) effort to explore the solar neighborhood . to date , we have reported astrometric perturbations with amplitudes of tens of milli - arcseconds ( hereafter , mas ) @xcite and continue to observe @xmath150 objects exhibiting perturbations in an effort to determine accurate masses for low mass stars and brown dwarfs . here",
    "we report an extraordinary perturbation of the m5.0v star scr 1848 - 6855 ( hereafter scr 1848 ) with an amplitude of more than 200 mas .",
    "this star was discovered during our supercosmos - recons ( scr ) search for high proper motion objects in the southern sky and found to have @xmath31287 yr@xmath4 @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we present a detailed analysis of this unusual system , including results from the 0.9-m program and several other ground - based and space - based efforts , to understand the physical properties of the mysterious companion .",
    "we used the ctio 0.9-m to measure the astrometric properties ( proper motion , parallax , perturbation of the photocenter ) and @xmath5 photometry of scr 1848 , and provide the results in table  [ tbl : basic ] .",
    "the telescope has a 2048@xmath62048 tektronix ccd camera with 0401 pixel@xmath4 plate scale @xcite . for both astrometric and photometric observations",
    ", we used the central quarter of the chip , yielding a 68 square field of view .",
    "we used the kron - cousins @xmath7 filter for parallax measurements to maximize the number of suitable reference stars in the field , and obtained @xmath5 photometry of scr 1848 and similar stars through johnson ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) and kron - cousins ( @xmath11 and @xmath7 ) filters .",
    "bias and dome flat frames were taken nightly for basic image reduction .",
    "we have one epoch of @xmath8 and @xmath9 photometry and four epochs of @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath7 , for which results are given in table  [ tbl : basic ] .",
    "additional details of parallax and photometry observations and data analysis can be found in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .    with more than 8 years of astrometric observations",
    ", the red dwarf exhibits an extraordinary perturbation with peak - to - peak amplitudes of @xmath1200 mas in ra and @xmath160 mas in dec . shown in figure  [ fig:1a ]",
    "is a map of the red dwarf s photocentric position relative to the barycenter , split into ra and dec directions , after shifts due to proper motion and parallax have been removed .",
    "we suspect that the epoch of periastron occurred around 2004.6 .",
    "this is the largest photocentric perturbation we have detected among more than 700 targets observed astrometrically at the 0.9-m since 1999 . to eliminate any doubt that the perturbation is real , for comparison we also present residuals from a reference star in the field in figure  [ fig:1b ] ,",
    "in which the vertical scale is one - fifth that for scr 1848 .    because the scale of the perturbation exceeds the size of the parallactic ellipse by a factor of five ( so far ) , the parallactic motion is overwhelmed by the perturbation , and the yearly cadence of the parallax remains in figure  [ fig:1a ] , particularly in the ra axis . to derive an accurate trigonometric parallax for the system , we therefore solve for proper motion , parallax , and orbital motion iteratively .",
    "we first carry out a standard reduction for proper motion and parallax .",
    "a reduction using all of the data without compensating for the perturbation results in a parallax of 24.26@xmath122.30 mas ( 41 pc ) , which is inconsistent with the more carefully treated results discussed below .",
    "we then fit an photocentric orbit to the residuals shown in figure  [ fig:1a ] .",
    "this orbit is then removed , and we derive the results for proper motion ( 1280.9@xmath120.3 mas / yr ) and parallax ( 40.63@xmath120.72 mas ) , placing the system at a distance of 24.6 pc .",
    "after the first iteration of removing the large perturbation , the residuals in ra were reduced by a factor of 4.5 and the parallax error was reduced by a factor of 3 .",
    "these new residuals are comparable to the night - to - night variations in the photocenter positions , and the parallax error is less than our median parallax errors ( @xmath11.4 mas ) for stars with coverage of at least six years , so no further iterations were appropriate for the current dataset",
    ". we will continue to follow the system to improve our understanding of the overall path of the photocenter .",
    "further discussion is based upon the parallax of 40.63 mas as given in table  [ tbl : basic ] .",
    "we checked this result by evaluating only those images taken since 2007 to ensure that the perturbation persists , i.e. ,   selecting frames after the presumed periastron , with results shown in figure  [ fig:1c ] .",
    "a comparison of the reference star s motion in figure  [ fig:1b ] to the residual effect of the perturbation in scr 1848 s position in figure  [ fig:1c ] ( same scale in both panels ) reveals that the perturbation s effects are seen on both axes and that the science star is not single .",
    "the parallax ( 46.26@xmath120.70 mas ) derived for the 2007 - 2012 data is roughly in agreement with the results for all data with the perturbation removed , although we note that in this unusual case the parallax errors may be underestimated and the distance from 2007 - 2012 data should be treated with caution is significantly reduced compared to that in figure  [ fig:1a ] , we did not perform an orbital fit to revise the parallax .",
    "we merely use this reduction as additional assurance that the system is at a distance of roughly 24.6 pc . ] .",
    "details pertaining to the perturbation fit as well as the analysis of the photocentric orbit are discussed in section  [ sec : companion ] .",

    ", scr 1848 coincidentally shows its largest parallax residual in ra , as shown in figure  [ fig:1a ] . in order to understand how this faint background star affects the centroids by sextractor , we performed the following simulations to confirm that the perturbation is _ not _ due to this faint background star .",
    "first , we used the last few epochs of images , in which scr 1848 and the background source were widely separated ( e.g.  117 at position angle 18@xmath21 on ut 2011 september 26 ) , to measure the flux ratio of the two sources to be 400:1 in the @xmath7 filter used for the parallax series .",
    "no proper motion was detected for the background source during the last two years of images , so we then created simulated images of scr 1848 and the background source by using psfs of reference stars in the scr 1848 field utilizing the first image taken in each of the 28 epochs , and adding in the background source at its position measured at the last epoch .",
    "we then created fits images containing the two sources at epochs corresponding to our parallax frames by tracing scr 1848 s position from 2011 back to 2003 using scr 1848 s presumably uncorrupted proper motion and position angle values from @xcite .    using sextractor to determine the centroids of scr 1848 in the simulated images and in the original parallax frames , we find mean differences of 4.7 and 12.9 mas in ra and dec , respectively , in the 28 epochs of images .",
    "since 2005 , the differences are less than 1 mas .",
    "these results illustrate that the early epoch images have centroids that are slightly skewed by the background star and that the offsets are larger in dec than in ra , which is contradictory to what we see in the parallax residuals .",
    "in fact , the offsets in ra are @xmath140 times smaller than what is measured for the perturbation shown in figure  [ fig:1a ] .",
    "we therefore conclude that the faint background source is _ not _ the cause of the perturbation .",
    "the photometric distance estimated from @xmath22 colors using the suite of relations in @xcite is 37.0@xmath129.4 pc , which is 1.3@xmath23 further than the adopted trigonometric parallax distance of 24.6 pc , but is not terribly useful as a distance constraint .",
    "the large error in the photometric estimate is caused by photometric colors for the system that differ from similar stars .",
    "@xmath5 photometry for scr 1848 and six similar red dwarfs was obtained at the ctio 0.9-m on 2010 march 13 , and is given in table  [ tbl : ubvri ] .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : colorcolor ] , in a @xmath24 color plot scr 1848 is noticeably bluer than stars of comparable spectral types spanning similar @xmath25 , and does not follow the trend of similar red dwarfs in the @xmath26 vs. @xmath27 color - color plot . as discussed in section  [ sec : redblue ] , scr 1848 s red spectrum is a good match to the spectroscopic standards proxima and gj1061 at type m5.0v , but the @xmath8 and @xmath9 photometry indicates that the companion is contributing blue light to the system . if scr 1848 had @xmath2818.5 , consistent with other m5.0v , it would be only @xmath19.3 pc away , which is inconsistent with the trigonometric parallax .",

    "the long - term variability of scr 1848 in the @xmath7 band is only 9 millmags over 8.5 years , although this lower level might be expected because red dwarfs generally vary more in the @xmath10 band than in the @xmath7 band .",

    "from the various observations of scr 1848 outlined above , we have ( 1 ) detected a large perturbation on an m5.0v star at 24.6 pc caused by an unseen companion , ( 2 ) detected the excess @xmath8 band and nuv flux from the companion , ( 3 ) measured excess flux spectroscopically blueward of @xmath16500 , and ( 4 ) resolved the binary system .",
    "the next step is to determine the nature of the companion .",
    "we simulated @xmath41 photometry for systems composed of the m5.0v red dwarf proxima and various white dwarfs with @xmath41 from @xcite .",
    "basically , we move proxima and white dwarfs to scr 1848 s distance at @xmath124.6 pc but keep the same absolute magnitudes .",
    "we calculate their combined flux and photometry in different filters to simulate unresolved m5.0v@xmath2wd binaries .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : hruv ] .",
    "we found that to reproduce the combined @xmath41 photometry for scr 1848 , a white dwarf companion would need to have t@xmath42@xmath15000k to have enough flux for the combined u photometry , but t@xmath42@xmath14600k to match the flux indicated by the combined @xmath10 photometry .",
    "these results indicate that the blue companion could be a white dwarf with t@xmath42@xmath146005000k band photometry , which is from the white dwarf catalog @xcite . ] .        given the resolution of the system via hst - stis",
    ", we can estimate the temperature of the companion by generating a grid of model nuv colors ( @xmath43 ) under the assumption that the secondary emits as a blackbody . to find the colors ( observed@xmath0modeled ) for given @xmath10 magnitudes",
    ", we used the _ calcphot _ task in the iraf stsdas / synphot package to generate synthetic photometry for the secondary .",
    "based on the results shown in figure  [ fig : hruv ] , we explore temperatures of 4000k5000k , and target @xmath10 magnitudes of 1619 that correspond to the brightness anticipated at the distance of the scr 1848 system .",
    "our results indicate that the best match between the observed and modeled nuv colors ( @xmath44nuv@xmath450.03 mag ) are for a blackbody with @xmath46k , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 at the distance of scr 1848",
    ". however , a known da white dwarf with @xmath49k , wd 1345@xmath2238 , would have @xmath5017.2 and @xmath5118.8 , if it were moved to the distance of scr 1848 .",
    "it appears that the modeled white dwarf @xmath8 and @xmath10 magnitudes for scr 1848 b are fainter than a typical field white dwarf with @xmath52@xmath14600k . to complicate matters further , as shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : scr1848spectra ] , the residual flux peaks at @xmath15300 , corresponding to the peak of a 5500k blackbody curve , nearly 1000k hotter",
    "so , the exact temperature and nature of the companion remains elusive and a blackbody curve may not be ideal to represent its spectrum , but its temperature is likely 46005500k .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : scr1848spectra ] also shows that the companion s spectrum appears to be featureless .",
    "according to @xcite , a dc white dwarf is defined to have a continuous spectrum with no lines deeper than 5% in any part of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "this definition appears to be consistent with the spectroscopic information we have for the companion .",
    "it implies a spectral type of dc if it is in fact a white dwarf . in the inferred temperature range ( i.e. , t@xmath42 @xmath53 5500 k )",
    ", the white dwarf will show different continuum features in the optical depending on atmospheric composition .",
    "the possible atmospheric compositions are 1 ) pure hydrogen , where collision induced absorption ( cia ) occurs , 2 ) pure helium , where cia is unimportant , or 3 ) mixed hydrogen and helium , where cia occurs at hotter temperatures because of collisions with neutral helium @xcite . without knowing which model to apply , and how much the cia affects its spectral energy distribution , the effective temperature remains uncertain , but is likely in the temperature range discussed above .",
    "good s / n resolved photometry covering most of the sed of the companion is needed to best constrain the effective temperature @xcite . for",
    "now , we estimate that the companion may be a dc type white dwarf .",
    "the perturbation curve shown in figure  [ fig:1a ] maps the shift in position of the binary system s photocenter and reveals information about the masses of the components .",
    "however , because our data do not yet cover a full orbital period for the system , we find that the perturbation curve is not stable , with a slope in the curve after 2006 that varies as more images are acquired . an additional _ caveat _ is available from the hst - stis image , in which the b component is observed at a position angle of 277@xmath306 in mid-2011 , where the position angle of the photocenter from our perturbation curve lies at 63@xmath303 .",
    "the position angle of the secondary should be 180@xmath21 from the position of the photocenter offset , corresponding to 243@xmath303 rather than 277@xmath306 , or a 34@xmath303 difference .",
    "we could shift residuals or the photocenter to match the position angle from stis images , but we would not be significantly more confident in the orbit .",
    "we expect this mismatch is because of the incomplete photocentric orbit from our astrometric observations .",
    "ccccccc 15.17 & 0.2082 & 90.32 & 0.84 & 2004.58 & 280.74 & 248.08 + @xmath123.25 & @xmath120.0255 & @xmath120.37 & @xmath120.03 & @xmath120.02 & @xmath124.85 & @xmath122.25    with these reservations in mind , we fit a photocentric orbit given in table  [ tbl : element ] using the methodology outlined in @xcite . given the derived inclination is close to 90@xmath21 or edge - on , these orbital elements are suspect .",
    "however , one thing is certain  the orbital period is longer than our observing sequence of 8.5 years , and is otherwise poorly constrained . from the preliminary fit to the data , we find that the semi - major axis of the photocentric orbit is at least @xmath54 @xmath55 208 mas .",
    "we consider this a minimum semi - major axis given that the perturbation amplitude continues to grow as more frames are taken .",
    "we can use this value to constrain the mass of the companion by modeling @xmath54 using @xmath56 , where @xmath9 is the fractional mass ( @xmath57 ) , @xmath58 is the relative luminosity ( @xmath59 ) , and @xmath60 is the semi - major axis of the relative orbit of the two components @xcite .",
    "@xmath61 is the magnitude difference in the @xmath7 band in this case , because we used the @xmath7 filter for the astrometric series .",
    "the modeled results are shown in figure  [ fig : model.alpha ] , in which possible secondaries have masses 0.11.5@xmath62 , are fainter by 04 mag at @xmath7 , and are in orbits with periods of 1524 years . when constrained by @xmath54 @xmath63 208 mas from our preliminary fit",
    ", we see that the secondary has @xmath64 and @xmath65 1 .",
    "this implies that the secondary is too massive to be brown dwarf , which is also consistent with our discovery that the secondary is bluer than the m5.0v primary at optical / uv wavelengths .",
    "the period , as expected , is poorly constrained , and of course limits our ability to measure the companion mass . for example , if the secondary has a period of 15 years and @xmath662 ( top solid line in the top panel of figure  [ fig : model.alpha ] ) , its mass is @xmath10.7@xmath62 .",
    "if the secondary has a period of 24 years and @xmath662 ( bottom solid line in top panel of figure  [ fig : model.alpha ] ) , its mass is @xmath11.3@xmath62 . as a final consideration of the companion s mass",
    ", we compare 15 known cool white dwarfs with @xmath67 44905000 k from @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : model.alpha ] shows most of these cool white dwarfs have masses of 0.40.9@xmath62 , and that their i magnitudes would be 23 magnitudes fainter than scr 1848 after being placed at scr 1848 s distance .",
    "thus , we can not constrain the mass at this time , so it is important that we continue to follow the system to determine an accurate mass for the companion , which would provide a rare mass measurement of a low - temperature white dwarf .",
