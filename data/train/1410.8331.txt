    "double - mode cepheids are a powerful tool to test the stellar models of supergiants , since the simultaneous excitation of two pulsation modes tightly constrains the physical parameters . in the 1990",

    "@xcite obtained observational evidence of the relation between the period ratios and the metal abundances by means of high - resolution spectroscopy of galactic double - mode cepheids .",
    "the metallicity of the large ( lmc ) and small ( smc ) magellanic clouds has been investigated by using the period ratios of hundreds of double - mode cepheids in the framework of large - scale surveys : macho ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , eros-2 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ogle - iii ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )    the involved radial modes are the fundamental ( @xmath3 ) and the first ( @xmath4 ) , second ( @xmath5 ) , and third ( @xmath6 ) overtones .",
    "typical period ratios are @xmath7=0.71 , @xmath8=0.80 , @xmath9=0.68 . however , the large - scale surveys revealed other particular subclasses : stars with a nonradial mode in close proximity to the dominant @xmath4 mode and double - mode pulsators with a period ratio of 0.60 - 0.64 .    on the other hand ,",
    "triple - mode cepheids are extremely rare .",
    "the current statistics @xcite report six cases of @xmath10 stars ( three in the lmc , one in the smc , and two in the galactic bulge ) and four cases of @xmath11 stars ( two in the lmc , two in the smc ) .",
    "the two triple - mode cepheids in the galactic bulge have extremely short periods : the @xmath4 periods are 0.295  d and 0.230  d , corresponding to @xmath3 periods shorter than 0.4  d. the variability of gsc  0746 - 01186 was discovered in the asas survey ( asas  064135 + 0756.6 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the star was classified as a cepheid with @xmath12=1.28859  d , with an amplitude of 0.41  mag and @xmath13=12.48 .",
    "later , @xcite identified it as a double - mode cepheid with periods @xmath0=1.28861  d and @xmath1=1.03153  d. these periods were confirmed by the analysis of the nsvs data @xcite .",
    "the ratio of 0.8005 suggested a pulsation in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 modes .",
    "gsc  0746 - 01186 @xmath14 asas  064135 + 0756.6 @xmath14 sra01b.16229 was re - observed during the best  ii survey ( berliner exoplanet search telescope ; * ? ? ?",
    "the double - mode pulsation and the period ratio were both confirmed .",
    "the space mission corot @xcite monitored the star in a serendipitous mode since it is located in a field contiguous to that of the open cluster ngc  2264 , the main target of the first short run in the anticenter direction ( sra01 ) .",

    ", in preparation ) .",
    "corot 0223989566 was observed continuously for 23.4  d from 2008 march 7 to march 31 .",
    "the exodat catalog @xcite reports a spectral type of a5  iii , an e@xmath15=1.1  mag ( both from sed analysis ) , and a very low contamination level due to close stars , i.e. , 0.004 in a range from 0 to 1 .",
    "the  corot variability classifier \" ( cvc ) automated supervised method @xcite correctly suggests a classical or a double - mode cepheid .",
    "the measurements of corot 0223989566 were performed in the 512-s mode from jd 2454533.4120 to 2454536.008 and then in the 32-s mode until the end of the observations , at jd 2454556.795 .",
    "all the corot measurements were taken into account for the initial frequency analysis .",
    "the final time series is composed of 52,148 measurements : they were obtained in the chromatic mode , but here we discuss the white measurements only since we are interested in a detailed frequency analysis requiring a high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) . the high - precision , high duty - cycle corot photometry provides us with an excellent representation of the beating between two commensurable periods ( fig .",
    "[ curves ] , top panel ) .",
    "the four maxima span the short beating period of 5.16  d=4@xmath0=5@xmath1 .",
    "the frequency analysis was performed by means of the iterative sine - wave , least - squares fitting method @xcite .",
    "it was applied to the original corot time series composed of 32-s and 512-s exposures and to a new data set obtained by grouping 16 consecutive 32-s measurements into a single 512-s point .",
    "the frequency values were refined by the mtrap algorithm @xcite , allowing us to search for the best fit by keeping the values of the harmonics and the combination terms locked to the independent frequencies .",
    "the analysis of the corot data identified the two frequencies corresponding to the periods already known .",
    "the peak at @xmath16=0.776  d@xmath17 is by far the highest in the power spectrum , but 2@xmath16 and @xmath18=0.970  d@xmath17 are also immediately noticeable ( panel _ a _ ) .",
    "the @xmath18 peak and the combination terms @xmath16+@xmath18 and @xmath18@xmath19@xmath16 were detected after prewhitening the data with @xmath16 and its harmonics ( panel _ b _ ) .",
    "the four terms @xmath16 , @xmath18 , @xmath16+@xmath18 , and @xmath18@xmath19@xmath16  are the most common in the solutions of the light curves of double - mode cepheids obtained from ground - based data @xcite .",
    "we expected that the subsequent analysis of the corot time series would disclose the rich ensemble of combination terms between the harmonics of @xmath16 and @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , it was a great surprise to detect a new independent term @xmath20=0.529  d@xmath17 , at the next step ( panel _ c _ ) .",
    "the presence of the @xmath16+@xmath20 peak was particularly important since it immediately ruled out that @xmath20 was due to the variability of a close , unresolved star in the corot mask or to a binary companion .",
    "after this , the combination terms between the harmonics of @xmath16 , @xmath18 , and @xmath20 were detected step - by - step , as shown in panel _",
    "d _ for a subset of nine of them .",
    "the final solution of the corot light curve was provided by the independent terms @xmath16=0.776006 @xmath21 0.000002  d@xmath17 , @xmath18=0.969787 @xmath21 0.000016  d@xmath17 , and @xmath20=0.529632 @xmath21 0.000143  d@xmath17 , their harmonics ( up to 7@xmath16 , 2@xmath18 , and 2@xmath20 ) and a set of 23 other combination terms , for a total of 34  components .",
    "the error bars on the amplitudes @xmath22  mag and on the phases @xmath23 can be immediately derived following @xcite .",
    "the discovery of @xmath20 opened the possibility that other modes were excited and we performed an additional analysis to find them .",
    "the power spectra of the entire data set show some peaks close to @xmath16  and , much less relevant , to @xmath18 .",
    "the highest one was at @xmath24=0.728  d@xmath17 with an amplitude 0.008  times that of @xmath16 .",
    "the nature of these peaks is ambiguous .",
    "they could have a stellar origin and be due to a long - term modulation of the main oscillations , observed in some @xmath25 cepheids @xcite .",
    "however , we can not rule out the possibility that this long - term effect is actually due to satellite drift and/or detector aging . the analysis of the light curve of the residuals helped us to clarify this point .",
    "therefore , we calculated a new set of residuals by subdividing the 23.4-d time baseline into six contiguous subsets spanning 3.9  d each .",
    "the frequency values were kept fixed , but the amplitudes and phases were recalculated for each subset .",
    "then , the residuals obtained from these subsets were merged .",
    "the residual light curve thus obtained is almost flat and the erratic oscillations have completely disappeared ( fig .",
    "[ curves ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "we can infer that the erratic oscillations are due to instrumental effects that are affecting the corot photometry in such a way that the usual technique of prewhitening was not able to clean ( see also the case of corot 101155310 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    therefore , we can conclude that after @xmath20 no other independent mode is detectable in the light curve of corot 0223989566 .",
    "the analysis of the data of corot 0223989566 returned three independent periods : @xmath0=1.2886  d , @xmath1=1.031140  d , and @xmath2=1.888538  d. this triplet is completely new among galactic cepheids .",
    "the period ratios are @xmath26=0.8002 , @xmath27=0.546 , and @xmath28=0.682 .",
    "figure  [ dm ] shows the petersen diagram of the galactic double - mode cepheids . there is little doubt on the fact that @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be typified with the @xmath4 and @xmath5 modes , as is done in the galactic , lmc , and smc double - mode cepheids .",
    "@xmath2 is giving us more trouble .",
    "the ratio 0.68 has been observed in two double - mode lmc cepheids @xcite and in six triple - mode cepheids ( @xmath10 ) in both the magellanic clouds @xcite .",
    "the related periods were identified with those of the @xmath6 and @xmath4 modes . however , this is not the case for corot 0223989566 : since @xmath2 is longer than @xmath0 , it should be the @xmath4 mode and @xmath0 the @xmath6 one , contradicting the previous robust identification of @xmath0 as the @xmath4 mode .    the fact that @xmath2 is much longer than @xmath0 and",
    "@xmath1 naturally suggests its identification with the @xmath3 radial mode .",
    "however , the corresponding ratio @xmath7=0.682 is lower than the usual one ( 0.694 - 0.746 ; * ? ? ?",
    ". moreover , fig .",
    "[ dm ] shows how the @xmath7 ratio is expected to increase toward short @xmath3-periods , thus making the 0.682 ratio of corot 0223989566 still more peculiar .",
    "there is only one example of a ratio of 0.68 typified as a @xmath7 one , i.e. , j045917 - 691418 ( @xmath29=3.08  d and @xmath0=2.10  d ) in the lmc ( it is the apparently lowest outlier in fig .  3 of * ?",
    "the unusual ratio is explained in terms of an high - metallicity of @xmath30 ( see also fig .  3 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the mean metallicity of lmc double - mode cepheids is 0.004 .",
    "pulsator since the period ratio agrees very well with those of the double - mode and triple - mode cepheids recalled above .",
    "we verified that a @xmath3-period of 3.08/0.715=4.31  d matches the @xmath31 relation as well as 3.08  d. ] the fundamental period of corot 0223989566 is shorter than that of j045917 - 691418 and a still higher metallicity is necessary to include the @xmath32 location of corot 0223989566 between the limits where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are both unstable @xcite .    therefore ,",
    "if @xmath2 is actually the @xmath3 mode , corot 0223989566 is a very particular star : not only the unique @xmath11 cepheid in the galaxy but also one with an unusual @xmath7 ratio . in any case , corot 0223989566 is the triple - mode cepheid showing the longest periods , both in the galaxy and in the magellanic clouds . in the context of the galactic cepheids",
    ", it should be noted that @xmath12=1.8  d seems to be the shortest @xmath3 period among the @xmath7 double - mode stars and the longest @xmath4 period among the @xmath8 ones ( fig .",
    "[ dm ] ) .      the fourier decomposition could be used to disentangle the matter , since the first harmonics were found for the three periods of corot 0223989566 .",
    "we calculated the fourier parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 from the amplitude ( @xmath35 ) and phase ( @xmath36 ) coefficients of the @xmath37 and @xmath38 harmonics of the three independent frequencies @xmath16 , @xmath18 , and @xmath20 .",
    "v371  per is another double - mode cepheid where the @xmath39=0.15 of the @xmath3-mode is below the 0.20 limit and smaller than the @xmath39=0.22 of the @xmath4-mode @xcite .",
    "we can suppose that the small amplitude of the @xmath3-mode oscillation reduces the @xmath39 value .",
    "it is also noteworthy that v371  per shows an unusual high @xmath7 period - ratio ( 0.731 ) , explained in terms of a metal deficiency ( @xmath40[fe / h]@xmath41 ) .",
    "therefore , it seems that given stars could deviate from the most common ratios .",
    "another possibility is to identify @xmath20 as a nonradial mode .",
    "nonradial modes have been detected in @xmath4 lmc cepheids and @xmath42 double - mode lmc cepheids , always closely to the @xmath4 mode ( @xmath43  d@xmath17 ; * ? ? ?",
    "if we suppose a canonical @xmath42 frequency ratio of 0.72 , we have @xmath44=0.559  d@xmath17 . the difference @xmath45",
    "d@xmath17 is still in the range where we can think of a resonance .",
    "however , also under these assumptions corot 0223989566 remains an unique and challenging case since we have to model the excitation of a nonradial mode close to the expected   but not observed  ",
    "@xmath3 radial mode .",
    "the @xmath31 relation for galactic cepheids @xmath46 @xcite supplies similar @xmath47 values if we consider @xmath20=0.529  d@xmath17 or @xmath48  d@xmath17 as the frequency of the @xmath3 radial mode , i.e. , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively . the color excess @xmath51=1.1 ( exodat ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) yields @xmath52=3.5 , the distance modulus @xmath53 and the galactic coordinates ( @xmath54=204@xmath557407 , @xmath56=+01@xmath554386 ) put corot 0223989566 at 1.4kpc from the sun , behind and farther than ngc  2264 ( 9.3 ; 202@xmath55936 + 02@xmath55196 ) .",
    "the large color excess seems confirmed by available photometry : @xmath57=12.50 @xcite and @xmath58=13.6 ( gsc  2.2 catalog ) .",
    "smaller values close to @xmath51=0.4 have been measured in that direction @xcite .",
    "such a value would push corot 0223989566 at 4.0kpc from the sun .",
    "place corot 0223989566 on the extreme  outer arm \" , not far from the b0ii star hd  43818 , i.e. , in an environment known to be metal rich @xcite .",
    "therefore , the very high metallicity could cause the @xmath7 period ratio to decrease in the opposite sense of what the low metallicity probably does for v371  per @xcite .",
    "the fact that the @xmath8 ratio is normal is not surprising , since the metallicity affects mainly the @xmath7 ratio @xcite .",
    "other evolutionary effects linked with the particular galactic location , as the first crossing of the instability strip of a young object or an anomalous mass with respect to other double - mode cepheids , can contribute to the unusual period ratio .",
    "the intensive corot monitoring of corot 0223989566 discovered a unique case among triple - mode galactic cepheids .",
    "the 0.682 ratio between the two longest periods is quite unusual .",
    "if interpreted as a @xmath7 ratio , the fact that corot 0223989566 belongs to a metal - rich environment like the  outer arm \" of the milky way could explain the value .",
    "we also note that the periods of corot 0223989566 are much longer than those of the triple - mode cepheids detected in the galactic bulge . if not a radial mode , the excitation of an isolated nonradial mode with a period much longer than that of the @xmath4 mode is also unusual for high - amplitude pulsators .    the corot space mission has been developed and operated by cnes , with contributions from austria , belgium , brazil , esa ( rssd and science program ) , germany , and spain .",

    "<S> the two modes with the largest amplitudes and period ratio of 0.80 are identified with the first ( @xmath0=1.29  d ) and second ( @xmath1=1.03  d ) radial overtones . the third period , which has the smallest amplitude but able to produce combination terms with the other two , is the longest one ( @xmath2=1.89  d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of 0.68 between the first - overtone period and the third period is the unusual feature . </S>",
    "<S> its identification with the fundamental radial or a nonradial mode is discussed with respect to similar cases in the magellanic clouds . in both cases the period triplet and the respective ratios make the star unique in our galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the distance derived from the period  luminosity relation and the galactic coordinates put corot  0223989566 in the metal - rich environment of the  outer arm \" of the milky way . </S>"
