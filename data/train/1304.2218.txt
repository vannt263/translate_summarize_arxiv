    "the value of @xmath116 is rather flat and takes on precisely the value expected for graphene without the degeneracy factor @xmath117 , which counts spin and valley degrees of freedom . for a topological insulator",
    "there is only one dirac cone and spin is no longer degenerate .",
    "we also note that the background value is independent of material parameters such as the fermi velocity .",
    "but this is no longer the case for a topological insulator . as @xmath118",
    "is increased whatever the value of @xmath113 the conductivity increases rather rapidly above its universal background value and shows concave upward behavior .",
    "this is traced to the changes in fermi velocity of eq .",

    "the case @xmath29 given as the solid black curve , corresponds precisely to graphene except for value of the degeneracy factor @xmath125 . in this case the universal background , well known in the graphene literature , is recovered .",
    "as @xmath126 is increased the optical spectral weight lost in the background is transferred to the intraband contribution not shown above .",
    "increasing @xmath121 changes the band structure and no optical sum rule applies . as @xmath121",
    "is increased at fixed value of chemical potential @xmath113 the magnitude of the interband onset ( @xmath127 ) ( which remains at @xmath128 ) increases as shown in the inset .",
    "in addition its increase at @xmath129 becomes even more rapid . while in the black",
    "dashed curve it is reasonably linear , the dotted curve for @xmath130 has acquired a significant upward curvature .",
    "these deviations from the universal background of graphene is the signature in optics of the hexagonal warping term in our hamiltonian [ eq .  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) ] .",
    "we have checked and found that these curves do not scale onto each other .",
    "the increase in @xmath131 with @xmath44 above the universal background value is to be contrasted with the behavior of the quasiparticle density of states @xmath88 given by eq .",
    "as in graphene , the case @xmath29 gives @xmath88 proportional to @xmath132 .",
    "as @xmath121 is increased however @xmath88 starts to deviate from linearity and , as we see in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , is progressively reduced below the solid black curve .",
    "this is easily understood with the help of the right inset where we plot the constant energy contours for @xmath133 for the three value of @xmath121 considered .",
    "for @xmath29 we get the black circle of graphene theory .",
    "as @xmath121 increases this contour distorts into a snowflake pattern ( blue curve ) which is however completely contained inside the black circle . of course , to keep the number of charge carriers the same we need to increase the chemical potential with increasing value of the warping parameter @xmath121 as we show in the left inset .",
    "what is plotted is the value of @xmath121 at fixed value of the number of charge carriers , which is around @xmath134 .",
    "helical dirac fermions exist at the surface of a topological insulator ( ti ) .",
    "these charge carriers have some similarity and also differences with the well known chiral dirac fermions in graphene .",
    "an important difference is a degeneracy factor @xmath125 of four which comes from the valley and spin degrees of freedom of graphene not applicable in ti .",
    "another important difference , well investigated in the case of @xmath6 doped with @xmath1 , is the hexagonal distortion seen in arpes . here",
    "we have studied how such a term changes optical properties . for realistic values of the warping parameter we found large changes in the interband transitions .",
    "a third difference is that , graphene involves pseudospin related to the sublattice degeneracy in its two atoms per unit cell crystal structure rather than real spin .",
    "furthermore in graphene the bands are spin degenerate , while in a topological insulator momentum and spin are locked with x - y component of real spin oriented perpendicular to its 2-d momentum k , with clockwise and anticlockwise orientation in conduction and valence band respectively .",
    "the universal flat background observed in graphene@xcite remains at small photon energies although modified by a factor of 4 because the valley spin degeneracy no longer applies . as @xmath44 increases large modifications in the effect of the interband transitions on the conductivity are noted , and these encode the information on the hexagonal warping of the dirac cone cross - section leading to a snowflake pattern .",
    "instead of being flat @xmath120 increases in a quasilinear fashion with a concave upward bent . the magnitude of this linear increase becomes larger with the magnitude of the hexagonal warping term as does the value of the jump in the conductivity at the threshold of twice the chemical potential ( @xmath135 ) . at the same time , we find that the density of state remains linear only at small @xmath44 and starts to fall below this linear behavior at the energy where the conductivity also starts to show its deviation from a constant background value .",
    "while the conductivity curves are bent upward due to fermi velocity features , the density of state bends downward a prediction that could be verified in combined optics and scanning tunneling spectroscopy(sts ) experiment .",
