    "the fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) effect @xcite was historically the first known realization of topologically ordered phases of matter @xcite .",
    "similar to the much simpler integer quantum hall ( iqh ) states , these remarkable states generally exhibit gapless edge modes , topologically protected by the gapped bulk .",
    "however , as opposed to iqh states , the bulk excitations generally carry fractional charges and anyonic statistics .    of particular interest",
    "are non - abelian fqh states , whose bulk excitations are anyons characterized by non - abelian braiding statistics .",
    "the non - local nature of operations generated by braiding the non - abelian anyons makes these states promising candidates as platforms for quantum information processing .",
    "indeed , it has long been suspected that the plateaus observed at filling factors @xmath1 and @xmath2 are described by the non - abelian moore - read @xcite and @xmath3 read - rezayi @xcite states , respectively .",
    "however , a conclusive experimental confirmation has yet to be reported @xcite .",
    "the difficulty of finding inherently non - abelian states has recently spurred interest in artificial realizations of non - abelian anyons using well established components , such as quantum wires , superconductors , topological insulators , and abelian quantum hall states as platforms .",
    "in particular , a tremendous amount of interest was invested in the construction of majorana zero - modes from the interplay between spin - orbit coupling , superconductivity , and a magnetic field in one - dimensional systems or on the edges of two - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "recently , realizations of zero - energy bound states with a richer non - abelian braiding statistics were proposed by coupling the edges of various abelian fqh states via different mechanisms @xcite .",
    "alternatively , closely related states were proposed in clean one - dimensional systems in the presence of strong interactions @xcite .",
    "various different experiments capable of detecting signatures of these defects were proposed @xcite . in particular ,",
    "josephson effect experiments naturally possess such imprints in the form of unusual periodicities , reminiscent of the non - local nature of the non - abelian anyons .",
    "for example , if the edges of two @xmath4 iqh states are gapped using a superconductor - backscattering - superconductor ( sbs ) heterostructure , the josephson current is known to be @xmath5-periodic as a function of the phase difference between the two superconductors due to the majorana zero modes residing on the interfaces .",
    "similarly , replacing the iqh states by laughlin fqh states , the josephson current is now @xmath6-periodic , where @xmath7 is the minimal fractional charge in the system@xcite .",
    "this fact can be seen as a consequence of the parafermion zero - modes residing on the domain walls .    in this paper",
    ", we study the non - abelian zero modes resulting from the interplay between multi - layer abelian fqh states and superconductivity . specifically , we focus on multi - layer systems with strong intra- and inter - layer interactions , in the absence of inter layer tunneling .",
    "such a situation is realized , for example , in experiments with two twisted graphene layers forming a moir pattern , where the mismatch induced between the layers suppresses tunneling @xcite .",
    "as we will demonstrate , by coupling the edges of two such @xmath0-component fqh states in an sbs heterostructure , one ends up with @xmath0 zero modes satisfying a generalized parafermion algebra presented in eq .",

    "we note that in more general situations , where an array of @xmath10 sbs junctions are considered , the ground state degeneracy is given by @xmath11 .    in a specific set of symmetric multi - layer systems , we show that the generalized parafermion bound states can be decomposed into multiplications of @xmath0 conventional parafermion modes , each of which is non - local and does not generate zero - energy states individually .",
    "we show that only one of these will be associated with the charge mode of the underlying fqh state , while the rest result from neutral modes .",
    "we then turn to study the josephson effect in our system .",
    "similar to single - layer fqh states , we find that a standard josephson effect experiment produces a @xmath6-periodicity , where @xmath7 is now the minimal charge in the multi - layer system",
    ". however , the possibility of realizing more elaborate configurations in the multi - layer system allows us to propose a novel josephson effect experiment which is capable of probing additional quantum numbers , related to the neutral degrees of freedom in our system .",
    "we do so by placing different superconducting contacts on different layers .",
    "this configuration is richer than the standard sbs heterostructure , as we now have control over the various relative phases between any pair of superconducting contacts . by studying the energy as a function of the various relative phases ,",
    "we show that all the quantum numbers associated with the underlying fqh state , including those related to the neutral modes , can be probed .",
    "in particular , we propose two relatively simple configurations : the first is the standard configuration which probes the charge sector ( see fig . [ super](a ) ) , while the second isolates the signal associated with the neutral modes ( see fig .",
    "[ super](b ) ) .    additionally , we find that inter - layer interactions induce a non - local josephson effect . in particular , by changing the superconducting phase between the two superconducting contacts within a single layer , a josephson current flows through the superconductors in the other layers .",

    "( [ eq3 ] ) , where @xmath9 is now an @xmath96 integer - valued @xmath9-matrix . following the arguments presented in the previous sections , we get @xmath0 zero - mode operators @xmath62 at the interfaces between the superconducting and backscattering regions .",
    "as expected , we obtain the same algebra as eq .",
    "( [ pf ] ) , where now the indices @xmath22 take the values @xmath157 and @xmath158 . furthermore , following the geometric arguments presented for the double - layer case , we find that the ground state degeneracy generated by the generalized parafermionic algebra is generally given by @xmath95|$ ] . to be exact , working in a physical sector in which the parity in each layer is conserved , the degeneracy is given by @xmath98|\\right)^{m-1}$ ] , where @xmath10 is the number of sbs junctions .",
    "as in the double - layer case , one can also study the imprints of the above generalized parafermions through the periodicity of the josephson effect .",
    "as before , we consider a situation in which different superconducting contacts are placed on different layers , and the relative superconducting phases on the various layers are controlled independently .",
    "similar to the previous section , the terms coupling different zero - modes across the junction now take the form @xmath159+h.c.,\\label{cp}\\ ] ] where @xmath160 is now an @xmath0-dimensional vector containing the phase differences on the various layers , and the vectors @xmath161 , whose elements are @xmath162 , form an orthonormal basis in @xmath0-dimensional space .",
    "in what follows , we focus on symmetric multi - layer systems , i.e. , systems in which the @xmath9-matrix is unaffected by the exchange of any two layers . to be more specific , we take a @xmath9-matrix of the symmetric form @xmath163    if we first set @xmath164 , eq .",

    "similar to the bilayer case , to detect imprints of the neutral modes , we choose the simple configuration @xmath172 . by varying @xmath132",
    ", we can find that the periodicity of josephson effect is now given by @xmath145 ( see appendix [ ap3 ] ) .    to better understand the connection between the above periodicities and the underlying charge and neutral modes",
    ", one can decompose the generalized parafermion operators into a multiplication of conventional ones ( see appendix [ ap3 ] ) .",
    "each conventional parafermion acts on the charge or one of the neutral sectors .",
    "we show in appendix [ ap3 ] that the phase @xmath148 affects only the parafermion associated with the charge sector , while if @xmath173 , only the parafermions associated with the neutral modes are affected by the superconducting phases .",
    "in this work we study the emergence of generalized parafermions in multi - layer fqh states . we did so using the well - known sbs configuration , previously used to generate majorana fermions or conventional parafermions in single layer systems .",
    "we further examined the situation in which distinct superconducting contacts are placed on different layers . in this case",
    ", one can control the various relative phases , and independently measure the corresponding josephson currents .",
    "this opens the door to novel josephson effect experiments , through which various distinct properties of the generalized parafermions and the underlying multi - layer fqh states can be measured .",
    "in particular , we demonstrated that the existence of off - diagonal @xmath9-matrix elements leads to a non - local josephson effect in which the phase difference on one layer induces a josephson current on the other layers .",
    "furthermore , in symmetric multi - layer systems , we propose specific configurations in which the periodicity of the josephson effect provides imprints of the neutral modes of the underlying fqh state , which are commonly inaccessible in josephson effect experiments .",

    "in this appendix , we present a coupled - wires construction of the multi - layer fqh states studied in main text . using this microscopic model",
    ", we make a connection between the physical superconducting phases , defined in terms of the microscopic degrees of freedom , and those entering the low energy hamiltonian studied in the main text .",
    "we will start by briefly reviewing the coupled - wire approach for single component fqh states .",
    "we will then generalize the approach to symmetric multi - layer fqh states .",
    "finally , we will use the resulting model to show that the phases applied between the superconducting contacts coincide with those appearing in the low energy hamiltonian studied in the main text .      in the coupled - wires approach ,",
    "we decompose the 2d quantum hall system into an array of @xmath10 coupled wires .",
    "we work in a convention in which the wires are pointing in the @xmath174 direction and the magnetic field is pointing in the @xmath175 direction .",

    "the simplest case is @xmath4 , which corresponds to the case where adjacent parabolas cross at the chemical potential ( i.e. , @xmath191 ) .",
    "we see that simple tunneling operators between the wires conserve momentum , and can therefore gap out the spectrum , leaving a single free chiral mode on each edge . to be specific , the terms we consider are @xmath192 we see that the two modes @xmath193 and @xmath194 remain free .",
