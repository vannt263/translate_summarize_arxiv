    "plastic flow of disordered solids subjected to external loading is known to occur via localized rearrangements of small sets of particles , coined shear - transformations  @xcite .",
    "such rearrangements have been identified in experiments on bubble rafts @xcite , foams @xcite , emulsions @xcite , and colloidal glasses @xcite , as well as in atomistic computer simulations of model glasses @xcite .",
    "an example of such a shear - transformation , observed in a model glass in two dimensions deformed under athermal , quasi - static ( aqs ) shear @xcite , is displayed in fig .",
    "shear - transformations are known to self - organize in spatially correlated patterns @xcite in solids subjected to large stresses and low deformation rates .",
    "their densities and other statistical properties , and mechanical consequences , are a subject of much recent debate  @xcite .",
    "two questions , central to theoretical descriptions of elasto - plasticity , that we address in this work , are : can shear - transformations be predicted a - priori , and , if so , how ?",
    "the micro - mechanical process in which an athermal disordered solid destabilizes under quasi - static deformation is understood , asymptotically close to an instability strain @xmath5 , as a saddle - node bifurcation of the potential energy @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the immediate precursors to shear - transformations at strains @xmath7 are identified as destabilized eigenfunctions @xmath8 ( i.e.  their associated eigenvalues vanish at @xmath5 ) of the dynamical matrix @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the coordinate vector of the @xmath11 particle . such an eigenfunction is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we refer to such eigenfunctions as _ destabilized modes _ , to distinguish them from the post - instability displacements of particles  agglomerations of shear - transformations  which can be spatially extended . in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b we demonstrate that , when the post - instability displacements are not spatially extended , but rather form an isolated elementary shear transformation , their spatial structure is very similar to that of the destabilized mode .",
    "in contrast with the post - instability displacements that depend in general on a specific choice of dynamics  @xcite , and on external control parameters such as temperature  @xcite , strain  @xcite , and strain rate @xcite , the spatial stucture of destabilized modes is an * intrinsic characteristic * of the multi - dimensional potential energy function , and is therefore the focus of the present study .",
    "a robust _ mechanical _ definition of the precursors of plastic instabilities away from instability strains has not yet been put forward .",
    "much effort has been dedicated recently to studying the role played by low - frequency normal modes in determining these precursors @xcite .",
    "one key difficulty encountered in such studies is that low - frequency plane - waves , which have no appreciable effect on plasticity @xcite , dominate the lower parts of the spectra of conventional model glasses , thus hindering attempts to use low - frequency modes to define flow - defect densities and correlate them with rates of plastic flow .",
    "another difficulty , which has been largely overlooked in the context of elasto - plasticity , is that mere frequencies of normal modes are not indicative of their relevance to plastic processes .",
    "in fact , modes which lead to mechanical instabilities ( i.e.  take the system over energy barriers and into neighboring inherent states ) appear as eigenfunctions of the dynamical matrix only very close to plastic instabilities , giving rise to difficulties in their detection and statistical quantification . here",
    "we show that the effective detection of such modes away from plastic instabilities necessitates the consideration of the degree of _ asymmetry _ associated to the variation @xmath12 of the potential energy upon displacing the particles along those modes .",
    "we provide a theoretical framework that naturally embeds a mechanical definition of the precursors to plastic instabilities , and which effectively accounts for the said asymmetry .",
    "we begin the discussion by considering an athermal elastic solid , of @xmath13 particles in @xmath14 dimensions , and let @xmath0 denote a @xmath15 dimensional unit vector , i.e.  @xmath16 . here and in what follows , repeated indices , labeling particles , are understood to be summed over , unless indicated otherwise .",
    "the coordinates @xmath17 are displaced in the direction defined by @xmath0 according to @xmath18 , and we expand the potential energy @xmath6 as : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the energy of the minimum in which the system resides , @xmath21 is the stiffness associated to @xmath0 , and @xmath22 is referred to in the following as the _ asymmetry _ associated to @xmath0 . within this cubic expansion ,",
    "stationary points occur at @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; @xmath23 corresponds to the minimum in which the system resides , while @xmath25 represents the saddle point ( energy barrier ) that separates this minimum and a neighboring inherent state .",
    "we thus define the energy difference between these stationary points , within the cubic expansion , as our _ barrier function _ : @xmath26    we emphasize that @xmath1 is defined for a particular configuration of an elastic solid in mechanical equilibrium , and is a function of the direction @xmath0 .",
    "it has a rough landscape @xcite ; in this work we focus on directions @xmath27 that correspond to local minima of @xmath1 .",
    "we refer to these directions in what follows as _",
    "plastic modes_. from the definition of @xmath1 it is clear that plastic modes @xmath27 are associated with small stiffnesses @xmath28 and large asymmetries @xmath29 ; they can be found numerically by minimizing @xmath1 over directions @xmath0 , starting from some initial direction @xmath30 , as demonstrated in panels * c)*-*f ) * of fig .",
    "small @xmath1 s should appropriately describe low saddle points ( barriers ) that separate the system from neighboring inherent states .",
    "we therefore expect modes @xmath27 that correspond to low - lying minima of @xmath1 ( which are found by chosing an appropriate @xmath30 for the minimization ) , to encode information about imminent plastic instabilities .",
    "the approach described above is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ; in panel * a ) * we display a destabilized mode @xmath8 calculated at the firstly - encountered plastic instability in an athermally sheared model glass , here at a strain @xmath31 . prior to this instability , at strains @xmath32 , the nonaffine displacement field @xmath33",
    "is calculated @xcite .",
    "an example of @xmath34 , calculated at @xmath35 , is shown in panel * c)*. at this distance ( in strain ) from the instability , the nonaffine displacements @xmath34 are largely delocalized .",
    "we use the normalized @xmath36 as the initial conditions @xmath30 for the minimization of @xmath1 ; snapshots along the minimization are displayed in panels * d ) * and * e)*. upon convergence , we find a local minimum in the direction @xmath27 , which is displayed in panel * f)*. the resemblance between @xmath27 and the destabilized mode @xmath8 is striking : both the geometry and the core location appear to agree perfectly .    this protocol is carried out over a broad range of intervals @xmath37 , as specified in the caption of fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] . for each @xmath37 , after finding @xmath27 as described above , we calculated its associated energy variation @xmath38 and stiffness @xmath28 , which are displayed in panels * a ) * and * b ) * of fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] , respectively . in this example , already at a distance of the order @xmath39 to the instability strain , following the plastic mode @xmath40 would carry the system above an energy barrier and into a neighboring minimum .",
    "we also plot in fig .",
    "[ fig1b]b the stiffness @xmath41 associated to the destabilizing mode @xmath8 .",
    "we find that only very close to the instability ( @xmath42 ) , the scaling @xmath43 holds @xcite , whereas the stiffness associated to @xmath27 follows @xmath44 up to strains of order 1% away from the instability .",
    "this finding supports the robustness of our definition of plastic modes , and the usefulness of our framework .",
    "it also supports the picture proposed by a number of recent studies @xcite , that assumes the ( reversible ) destabilization process of a ` soft spot ' in a deformed glass is predominantly coupled to the external load , and not to other coexisting ( reversible ) destabilization processes .",
    "the scaling @xmath45 can be derived as follows ; modes @xmath40 pertain to local minima of @xmath1 and therefore satisfy @xmath46 , which implies that ( see appendix ) : @xmath47 using this relation , we calculate the leading order variation of the stiffness @xmath28 with strain as @xmath48 as @xmath7 , @xmath49 , but @xmath50 goes to a constant , yielding the differential scaling relation @xmath51 , and thus the observed scaling @xmath52 .    the resolution of the plastic mode as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] uses the nonaffine displacements @xmath34 as the heuristic guess for @xmath30 ; this choice is made to demonstrate the usefulness of the framework  despite the extended character of @xmath34 , it has a large overlap with the plastic mode @xmath27 , and thus resides in the basin of @xmath27 on the landscape of @xmath1 . obtaining the full field of plastic modes",
    ", however , requires using other heuristic @xmath30 s , that reside in basins that belong to other plastic modes .",
    "we leave the investigation of the optimal heuristics for the detection of the full field of plastic modes for future work .",
    "how indicative are normal modes of imminent plastic instabilities , compared to plastic modes ? in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a we present a scatter - plot of the barrier function evaluated at normal modes @xmath53 , _ vs_.  the square of their associated frequencies @xmath54 , calculated for a few tens of undeformed ( isotropic ) solid realizations .",
    "a clear trend appears : smaller values of @xmath55 are found for lower - frequency modes .",
    "the circled data point represents the mode @xmath56 associated to the lowest value of @xmath55 amongst all modes calculated ; it is displayed in panel * d)*. remarkably , this normal mode displays the same spatial features as observed for destabilized modes , reinforcing that @xmath1 is indeed sensitive to ` plastic - like ' modes .",
    "the variation @xmath57 is plotted in panel * b ) * ( continuous line ) . despite possessing the smallest @xmath58 amongst our entire ensemble of modes",
    ", @xmath57 displays only a slight asymmetry between positive and negative displacements @xmath3 , and the energy monotonically increases with @xmath59 . using @xmath56 as the initial condition @xmath30 for the minimization of @xmath1 , we find the plastic mode @xmath27 displayed in panel * e)*. on the face of it , @xmath56 and @xmath27 appear to be very similar in their spatial structure and geometry . however , examining the corresponding variation @xmath38 , represented by the dashed line in panel * b ) * , reveals a dramatic difference between them : following  @xmath27  takes the system over a energy barrier , to a neighboring minimum .",
    "we further utilize our ensemble of normal modes to study the relation between the degree of localization of modes and their associated asymmetries @xmath60 .",
    "a similar analysis was carried out in @xcite in the context  of the unjamming point @xcite .",
    "we quantify the degree of localization of a mode @xmath61 via its participation ratio @xmath62^{-1}$ ] ; localized modes have @xmath63 , whereas maximally delocalized modes have @xmath64 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2]c we plot the means @xmath65 @xcite , averaged over modes @xmath61 with similar participation ratios , for systems of @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "we find that for participation ratios @xmath68 , the asymmetries follow @xmath69 .",
    "this can be explained with the following simple model : if there are effectively @xmath70 non - zero components in a normal mode ( @xmath71 ) , normalization then requires that a characteristic non - zero component is of magnitude @xmath72 .",
    "the participation ratio is then expected to follow @xmath73 ( due to summing over positive terms ) . since the pairwise potential is short ranged , and the tensor elements @xmath74 are of either sign , then @xmath60 consist of a sum over @xmath70 terms , each of order @xmath75 , of random signs , and we therefore expect @xmath76 , in consistency with our measurement . for participation ratios @xmath77 , this relation breaks down , and asymmetries are much _ smaller _ than what is predicted by this simple model , which assumes that normal modes are random objects .",
    "nevertheless , the same trend remains unchanged : delocalized modes are associated , on average , with more symmetric variations of the energy .",
    "these observations explain the localized nature of plastic instabilities found in deformed glasses , as can be seen , e.g. , in fig .",
    "to characterize the spatial structure of plastic modes , we define @xmath78 as the median of the squared magnitude of the components @xmath79 ( no summation implied ) , taken over a shell of thickness on the order of the nearest - neighbor distance , and of radius @xmath80 away from the core of the plastic mode ( detecting the locus of the core is explained in the appendix ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a we compare the spatial decay of two plastic modes , one obtained by setting @xmath30 to be the direction of the nonaffine displacements ( see definition above and fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , and the other by setting @xmath30 to be a random direction .",
    "these decay profiles are also compared to that of a destabilized mode @xmath8 .",
    "we also show the decay profile of a plastic mode calculate in a 3d solid .",
    "we find that at distances @xmath80 away from the core , plastic modes decay as @xmath81 .",
    "remarkably , this is the same decay law found for the linear responses of displacements to dipolar point forces @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b we present a plastic mode obtained with a random @xmath30 .",
    "we find that this mode shares the same geometric features as the destabilized modes @xmath8 upon shear - induced plastic instabilities  a disordered core , and a long - ranged affine quadrupolar shear - like displacement field away from the core @xcite .",
    "we thus conclude that plastic modes @xmath27 associated to different local minima of @xmath1 share similar structrural features , that do not depend on the particular minima to which they correspond .      we finally examine how the geometry of plastic modes depends on the loading conditions imposed on the solid . in panels * c ) * and * d ) * of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , two additional examples of plastic modes @xmath27 obtained from a random @xmath30 are displayed ; @xmath27 of panel * c ) * was calculated in a disordered network of relaxed hookian springs ( all springs are neither stretched nor compressed ) with an average of 4.1 springs connected to each node .",
    "it displays a similar spatial structure as that of plastic modes found in model glasses that are prestressed , i.e.  in which finite forces are exerted between the constituent particles @xcite .",
    "our findings indicate that proximity to prestress - induced micro - mechanical buckling instabilities @xcite is not the origin of the generic structure of plastic modes .    the plastic mode @xmath27 of panel * d ) * of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] was calculated in a lennard - jones glass ( with a pairwise potential that includes an attractive term , see appendix for details ) under isotropic tension , just before macroscopic failure ( here @xmath82 is at least @xmath83 of the yield strain , where @xmath84 is the pressure and @xmath85 is the bulk modulus ) .",
    "we find in this case that in addition to the clear shear - like displacements that are typically seen in plastic modes found in glasses under compressive stresses , the dilatant part of the displacements due to the tensile loading conditions is apparent .",
    "we conclude that the loading conditions imposed on a solid can be reflected in the geometric features of its plastic modes ; we leave the systematic study of this dependence for future work .",
    "in this work we demonstrated that modes @xmath27 corresponding to local minima of the barrier function @xmath1 , coined _ plastic modes _ , are indicative of directions in configuration space that lead to plastic instabilities , and more so compared to the most localized low - frequency normal modes . as such , our approach can serve as a solid basis for instability - detection algorithms",
    ". such algorithms are highly desirable , as they can put to test theoretical frameworks of elasto - plasticity that involve the dynamics of a population of ` soft - spots ' .",
    "these algorithms need not be restricted to the investigation of plastic flow in disordered solids ; the generality of our framework would render them suitable for studying a diverse set of systems , including dislocated crystalline solids , deeply supercooled liquids and proteins .",
    "furthermore , our theoretical framework explains the origin of the localized nature of plastic instabilities .",
    "building on our framework , we predict that the stiffness associated to plastic modes follows @xmath86 , and show numerically that this scaling holds over a large range of strains away from an instability strain @xmath5 .",
    "this adds relevance to recently proposed models that assume reversible destabilization processes of soft spots are decoupled from each other .",
    "finally , we have investigated the spatial features of plastic modes , and provide evidence that the detailed geometry of plastic modes is sensitive to the loading conditions imposed on the solid .",
    "we thank eran bouchbinder , smarajit karmakar , gustavo dring , itamar procaccia and matthieu wyart for fruitful discussions .",
    "we begin with describing our approach to calculating plastic modes ; starting from an initial guess @xmath30 , we minimize the barrier function : @xmath87 over directions @xmath0 in the @xmath15-dimensional configuration space . here",
    "@xmath88 is the potential energy , @xmath10 denotes the cartesian coordinate vector of the @xmath11 particle , and repeated indices are understood to be summed over .",
    "minimizations are carried out using a standard nonlinear conjugate gradient minimization algorithm , which was modified such that the norm @xmath89 remains of order unity , to maintain numerical stability .",
    "notice the invariance @xmath90 for any finite length @xmath3 , which allows us to control the norm without effecting the minimization process .",

    "first , we find the center of the core @xmath92 , which we determine following @xmath93 where @xmath94 denotes the set of the @xmath95 particles with the highest @xmath96 .",
    "the choice @xmath97 was found to be the optimal choice for most of the plastic modes we analyzed , and we never used @xmath98 .",
    "we then divided the area of the system into rings ( or shells in the 3d case ) of radius @xmath80 away from the center .",
    "the thickness of the rings was set such that there were at least 10 particles in each ring .",
    "for each ring , we found @xmath78 defined as the * median * value over all @xmath96 in that ring .",
    "we continue with describing the models used in this work , starting with the model glass for which most data are presented : a 50:50 binary mixture of ` large ' and ` small ' particles of equal mass @xmath99 , interacting via radially - symmetric purely repulsive inverse power - law pairwise potentials , that follow @xmath100&,&{{\\textstyle\\frac{r_{ij}}{\\lambda_{ij}}}}\\le x_c\\\\0&,&{{\\textstyle\\frac{r_{ij}}{\\lambda_{ij } } } } > x_c\\end{array } \\right.,\\ ] ] where @xmath101 is the distance between the @xmath11 and @xmath102 particles , @xmath103 is an energy scale , and @xmath104 is the dimensionless distance for which @xmath105 vanishes continuously up to @xmath106 derivatives .",
    "distances are measured in terms of the interaction lengthscale @xmath107 between two ` small ' particles , and the rest are chosen to be @xmath108 for one ` small ' and one ` large ' particle , and @xmath109 for two ` large ' particles .",

    "we note that with these densities two coordination shells fall within the interaction range .",
    "both the 2d and 3d systems undergo a computer - glass - transition at temperatures of about @xmath116 .",
    "solids were created by a fast quench from the melt to a target temperature @xmath117 , followed by an energy minimization using a standard nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithm .",
    "we employed two - dimensional systems of @xmath118 for producing the data presented in figures 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4b of the main text .",
