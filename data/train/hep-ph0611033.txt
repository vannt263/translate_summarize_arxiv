    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 beams of a mean energy of 125 gev were scattered off a target detector and the ratios @xmath7 and @xmath8 were measured .",
    "the nutev collaboration also provided a determination of the on - shell weak mixing angle  @xcite , @xmath9 this value is about @xmath10 below the value derived from the residual set of precision observables  @xcite .",
    "the fixed - collision - energy ratios @xmath11 and @xmath12 were not directly accessible at nutev .",
    "more precisely , ratios of counting rates , i.e. number of nc - like neutrino events over number of cc - like neutrino events and likewise for anti - neutrino events , @xmath13 , were measured and compared to sm predictions , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , obtained by a detailed monte carlo ( mc ) simulation .",
    "these predictions differ from the measured values by @xcite @xmath16 basically , there are three types of explanations of the observed anomaly .",
    "+ ( a ) _ there is no signal .",
    "_ the result might be a statistical fluctuation or theoretical errors may have been underestimated .",

    "nucleon deep - inelastic scattering ( dis)@xcite , which have been originally calculated almost 20 years ago @xcite .",
    "+ ( b ) _ the apparent signal is due to neglected but relevant sm effects . _",
    "an asymmetry between the distribution of the strange quark and its corresponding anti - quark in the nucleon ( @xmath17 ) could account for part of the deviation .",
    "the result of the measurement of the weak mixing angle could also be influenced by a violation of the usually assumed isospin symmetry ( @xmath18 ) , or nuclear effects which have not been taken into account . for a list of other sources",

    "+ ( c ) _ the signal is due to new physics . _",
    "many suggestions have been made , like effects from modified gauge boson interactions ( e.g. in extra dimensions ) , non - renormalizable operators , leptoquarks ( e.g. @xmath19-parity violating supersymmetry ) and supersymmetric loop effects ( e.g. in the mssm ) , just to name a few of them ( see @xcite and references therein for an overview ) .",
    "here we consider the effects of the radiative corrections to neutrino ",
    "nucleon dis in the mssm .",
    "although the nutev anomaly is not settled as yet , it is interesting to check how far the mssm could account for such a deviation .",
    "two earlier studies  @xcite treat the loop effects in the limit of zero - momentum transfer of the neutrino to the hadron , neglecting kinematical cuts and potential effects from the parton distribution functions .",
    "they conclude that the radiative corrections in the mssm can not be made responsible for the nutev anomaly , owing to the wrong sign .",
    "our calculation @xcite includes various kinematical effects . in particular",
    ", we include the full @xmath1 dependence of the one - loop amplitudes , evaluate hadronic cross sections using parton distribution functions and cuts on the hadronic energy in the final state ( @xmath20 ) at the nutev mean neutrino beam energy of 125 gev .",
