    "see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein .",
    "additionally , see @xcite and references therein for a more observationally - focused discussion . from a simulation standpoint , however , the two most common ways to obtain halo mass are through either spherical overdensity or friends - of - friends ( fof ) techniques .",
    "the spherical overdensity method identifies regions above a certain density threshold , either with respect to the critical density @xmath9 or the background density @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the matter density of the universe .",

    "the subtle @xmath27 density perturbations in place at the cmb epoch are vulnerable to numerical noise and intractable to simulate directly .",

    "it is thought that 2lpt  allows initial dm overdensities to get a `` head start '' compared with za , allowing earlier structure formation , more rapid evolution , and larger possible high - mass halos for a given redshift .",
    "we explore this possibility by evolving a suite of simulations from @xmath0 to @xmath1 and comparing the resulting differences in halo properties arising from initialization with za  and 2lpt  in these these otherwise identical simulations .",

    "as 2lpt  more accurately displaces initial particle positions and velocities , initialization with 2lpt  allows for a later starting redshift compared with an equivalent za - initialized simulation .",
    "however , many za  simulations do not take this into account , starting from too late an initial redshift and not allowing enough e - foldings to adequately dampen away numerical transients .",

    "the choice of @xmath87 for normalization allows us to be unbiased in our assumption of which halo better represents the truth , but can mask large differences between individual halos .",

    "as our fitting distributions are symmetrical , in order to derive uncertainties for skew , we measure the skew of the distributions for each of our three simulation boxes individually as well as for the single stacked data set . uncertainty in skew",
    "is then simply the standard deviation of the mean of the skew of the three individual boxes .    determining the uncertainty in the kurtosis is slightly more involved , as kurtosis is determined by a transformation of the generalized normal distribution s shape parameter @xmath91 according to equation  [ eq : kurtosis ] . following the standard procedure for propagation of uncertainty , we calculate the standard deviation of the kurtosis : @xmath100.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the derivative of the gamma function is @xmath101 where the digamma function @xmath102 is the derivative of the logarithm of the gamma function and is given by @xmath103 if the real part of @xmath104 is positive .",

    "this is better suited to track the fractional differences between the halo populations and allows us to pose questions like : how many 2lpt  halos are more massive than their za  counterparts by at least a given amount ?",
    "however , this function is inherently non - symmetrical , and is only defined for @xmath108 for positive quantities like mass and concentration .",
    "therefore , in order to count halo pairs that differ by a certain amount , regardless of whether @xmath36 is larger for the 2lpt  or za  halo , we define @xmath109 the value for which a halo pair with a larger @xmath36 in za  would differ by the same factor as a halo pair with a larger @xmath36 in 2lpt .",
    "with our catalog of matched dark matter halos , we directly compare differences in halo properties arising from initialization with 2lpt  vs za .",

    "morphologies appear similar for most halos , indicating good halo matches between simulations . however , many pairs display differences in central morphology , such as the number and separation of central density peaks . we interpret these cases to be examples of differences in merger epochs , in which case one halo may still be undergoing a major merger , while its companion is in a more relaxed post - merger state .",

    "larger early halos may also increase clustering , speed up large scale structure formation , and influence studies of the high-@xmath3 halo mass function , abundance matching , gas dynamics , and galaxy formation .    in these discussions , it is important to note that it is wrong to assume that the za  halo properties are the `` correct '' halo properties , even in a statistical sense .",
    "while halo mass suggests the most obvious shortcoming of za  simulations , even properties such as concentration  that show little difference on average between 2lpt  and za  can have large discrepancies on an individual halo basis .",
    "failure to consider uncertainties in halo properties for high @xmath3 halos in za  simulations can lead to catastrophic errors .",
    "we note a few caveats with our simulations and analysis .",
    "we did not exclude substructure when determining the properties of a halo , and although this would not change the broad conclusions herein , care must be taken when comparing to works which remove subhalo particles in determining halo mass and concentration .",
    "halo matching is not perfect , as it is based on one snapshot at a time , and may miss - count halos due to merger activity and differences in merger epochs .",
    "however , we believe this effect to be minor . while we compared rockstar s output with our own fitting routines and found them to broadly agree , rockstar  does not provide goodness of fit parameters for its nfw profile fitting and @xmath138 measurements .",
    "it also may be debated whether it makes sense to even consider concentration of halos at high redshift which are not necessarily fully virialized .    as rockstar",
    "does not provide goodness - of - fit parameters for its internal density profile measurements used to derive concentration , error estimates for concentration values of individual halos are unknown .",
    "additionally , proper density profile fitting is non - trivial , as the non - linear interactions of numerical simulations rarely result in simple spherical halos that can be well described using spherical bins .",
    "halo centering issues may also come into play , although rockstar  does claim to perform well in this regard .",
    "we use a simulation box size of only ( 10 mpc)@xmath139 .",
    "this is too small to effectively capture very large outlier density peaks .",
    "we would , however , expect these large uncaptured peaks to be most affected by 2lpt  initialization , so the effects presented here may even be dramatically underestimated .",
    "additionally , a larger particle number would allow us to consider smaller mass halos than we were able to here , and to better resolve all existing structure .",
    "a higher starting redshift could probe the regime where 2lpt  initialization contributes the most .",
    "it would also be of interest to evolve our halo population all the way to @xmath137 .",
    "the addition of baryons in a fully hydrodynamical simulation could also affect halo properties .",
    "these points may be addressed in future studies .",
    "we analyzed three 2lpt  and za  simulation pairs and tracked the spherical overdensity dark matter halos therein with the 6-d phase space halo finder code rockstar  to compare the effect of initialization technique on properties of particle  matched dark matter halos from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "this approach allowed us to directly compare matching halos between simulations and isolate the effect of using 2lpt  over za . in summary , we found the following :    * 2lpt  halos get a head start in the formation process and grow faster than their za  counterparts .",
    "companion halos in 2lpt  and za  simulations may have offset merger epochs and differing nuclear morphologies . *",
    "2lpt  halos are , on average , more massive than za  halos . at @xmath115 ,",
    "the mean of the @xmath113 distribution is @xmath116 , and 50% of 2lpt  halos are at least 10% more massive than their za  companions .",
    "by @xmath1 , the mean @xmath113 is @xmath136 , and 10% of 2lpt  halos are at least 10% more massive .",
    "* this preference for more massive 2lpt  halos is dependent on redshift , with the effect most pronounced at high @xmath3 .",
    "this trend is best fit by @xmath140 . *",
    "earlier collapse of the largest initial density peaks causes the tendency for more massive 2lpt  halos to be most pronounced for the most massive halos , a trend that increases with redshift .",
    "we find a trend of @xmath141 for @xmath142 .",
    "by @xmath1 , this has flattened to @xmath143 . as a function of redshift , the slopes of these equations are fit by @xmath144 . *",
    "halo concentration , on average , is similar for 2lpt  and za  halos .",
    "however , even by the end of the dark ages , the width of the @xmath114 distribution@xmath145 at @xmath1is large and indicative of a significant percentage of halos with drastically mismatched concentrations , despite the symmetrical distribution of @xmath114 . at @xmath115 , 25% of halo pairs",
    "have at least a factor of 2 concentration difference , with this falling to 15% by @xmath1 .",
    "* there is a trend for za  halos to be more concentrated than 2lpt  halos at high mass .",
    "however , this trend seems to reverse above @xmath146 .",
    "we find @xmath147 at @xmath115 and @xmath148 at @xmath1 .",
    "the slopes of these equations , as a function of redshift , are fit by @xmath149 .",
    "this is not visible in the symmetrical @xmath114 distributions , as the trends are roughly centered about zero and are washed away when integrated across the entire mass range .",
    "we have found that choice of initialization technique can play a significant role in the properties of halo populations during the pre - reionization dark ages .",
    "the early halo growth displayed 2lpt  simulations , or conversely the delayed halo growth arising from the approximations made in za - initialized simulations , makes careful attention to simulation initialization imperative , especially for studies of halos at high redshift .",
    "it is recommended that future _",
    "n_-body  simulations be initialized with 2lpt , and that previous high-@xmath3 or high - mass halo studies involving za - initialized simulations be viewed with the potential offsets in halo mass and concentration in mind .",
    "this work was conducted using the resources of the advanced computing center for research and education ( accre ) at vanderbilt university , nashville , tn .",
    "we also acknowledge the support of the nsf career award ast-0847696 .",
    "we would like to thank the referee for helpful comments , as well as the first author s graduate committee , who provided guidance throughout this work ."
