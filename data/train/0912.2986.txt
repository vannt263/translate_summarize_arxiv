    "the secant map has two basepoints on @xmath132 , corresponding to the two singularities .",
    "the quartic curve has nodes at these basepoints .",
    "this explains the degree @xmath6 of the third component .",
    "these examples illustrate the general fact that the dual variety of the edge surface is a curve in the dual @xmath25 .",
    "this is well known , but for lack of reference we include a short proof .",
    "as above , cuspidal points on the curve @xmath26 play a particular role .",
    "here we take a cusp to mean any point @xmath277 such that the normalization @xmath278 is ramified over @xmath279 , i.e. there is some point @xmath280 at which the normalization is not an immersion .",
    "[ comp ] the variety dual to the edge surface of any space curve is a curve .",
    "in particular , each component of the edge surface is either a cone or the tangent developable of a curve .",
    "a cone is a component of the edge surface if and only if it is a cone of secants with vertex at a cusp , or the general ruling intersects the curve twice outside the vertex .",
    "let @xmath281 be a component of the curve of stationary bisecants and let @xmath282 be a minimal desingularization of the corresponding component @xmath283 of the edge surface .",
    "then @xmath284 is a @xmath119-bundle over the normalization @xmath285 of @xmath281 with a birational morphism onto the scroll @xmath283 that contains @xmath26 in @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath48 be a general line in the ruling of this scroll , and assume first that @xmath48 does not pass through a cusp on @xmath26 .",
    "then @xmath48 is a secant between distinct points on @xmath26 whose tangents span a plane @xmath279 .",
    "the pullback of this plane on @xmath284 is a curve @xmath39 that decomposes into @xmath286 for some positive integer @xmath287 and is singular at the two points of tangency on the pullback @xmath288 of the line @xmath48 .",
    "now , the curve @xmath39 is singular at a point of @xmath288 only if this is a point of intersection between the component @xmath289 and @xmath288 or @xmath290 . but @xmath39 will intersect the general ruling in only one point , so @xmath289 can not intersect @xmath288 in more than one point . therefore @xmath291 is singular along the whole ruling , i.e. @xmath290 and the plane @xmath279 is tangent to the scroll along @xmath48 . if @xmath48 is a secant line through a cusp , the component of the edge surface is a cone of secants with vertex at a cusp , and the plane @xmath279 is tangent to the scroll along @xmath48 .",
    "thus the tangent plane is constant along each ruling , and the dual variety is a curve . to complete the proof , we consider biduality : our scroll is the dual variety of a curve , so it is a cone if the curve is planar , and it is the tangent developable of the curve of osculating planes if the curve is not planar .",
    "since any cone has constant tangent planes along the rulings , a cone is a component of the edge surface for any curve that meet the general ruling in at least two distinct points outside the vertex .",
    "the only other way a cone could be a component of the edge surface is when the vertex is on the curve and the general ruling intersect the curve in one more point . to see this",
    ", we assume the vertex point is not a cusp on the curve . by assumption",
    ", each secant line from the vertex point is a stationary bisecant line , so there is a plane for each tangent to the curve that contains a tangent line at the vertex .",
    "therefore the projection of the curve from a tangent line at the vertex is ramified everywhere on the curve .",
    "this is impossible over @xmath292 , and the proof is complete .",
    "even when the curve @xmath26 is generic and smooth , the edge surface is always highly singular @xcite .",
    "first of all , the edge surface has multiplicity @xmath293 along @xmath26 itself .",

    "the edge surface is in general the tangent developable of a curve .",
    "a plane section of the edge surface have cusps at this curve , so the edge surface has a cuspidal edge along this curve .",
    "finally the edge surface has in general an additional double curve , where two sheets of the surface intersect transversally .",
    "we compute the degrees of the cuspidal edge and of the double curve .",
    "let @xmath26 be a general smooth curve of degree @xmath18 and genus @xmath19 .",
    "the edge surface , which is reduced and irreducible , has multiplicity @xmath293 along @xmath26 and the 1-dimensional singular locus contains in addition a cuspidal edge of degree @xmath294 and a double curve of degree @xmath295 .",
    "the dual variety of the edge surface is a curve .",
    "the strict dual to this curve , the curve of osculating planes , is the cuspidal edge of the edge surface .",
