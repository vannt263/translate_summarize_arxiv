    "the pseudocubic perovskite kcuf@xmath0 is a magnetic insulator that has attracted significant interest since the sixties , as a prototype material for orbital ordering , cooperative jahn - teller distortion , and low - dimensional magnetism.@xcite kcuf@xmath0 is also structurally related to high - t@xmath3 superconducting cuprates and colossal - magnetoresistance manganites . in recent years , renewed attention has been given to the problem of orbital ordering and to the study of the interactions between orbital , magnetic , and structural ordering in strongly correlated @xmath1-transition - metal compounds , stimulated in large part by the interest in colossal - magnetoresistance manganites.@xcite in the latter systems , the interplay between orbital , charge , spin , and lattice degrees of freedom is known to play an essential role in establishing the observed physical properties .",
    "contrary to the case of charge , spin , and lattice ordering , however , which can be investigated by conventional x - ray , neutron , and electron diffraction techniques , direct experimental observation of orbital ordering has been  and remains in most cases  a challenge .",
    "recently , resonant elastic x - ray scattering ( rxs ) techniques have been developed to probe orbital ordering .",
    "rxs has been applied to a number of orbitally - ordered compounds , including various manganites@xcite and kcuf@xmath0.@xcite except for very recent measurements carried out on layered / doped manganites at the mn @xmath4 edges,@xcite most of the experiments performed to date have used excitations from the transition - metal 1@xmath5 core level , i.e. , k - edge excitations . in the case of kcuf@xmath0 and for related perovskite manganites such as lamno@xmath0 , the k edge excitation is the only possible core - level excitation for which resonant photons have a sufficiently large wavevector to access a bragg vector of the targetted orbitally ordered structure .",
    "the k - edge scattering process in manganites and kcuf@xmath0 , however , derives from virtual electric dipole excitations to empty transition - metal 4@xmath6 states .",
    "the resulting rxs amplitude is thus not directly related to the @xmath1 states that exhibit orbital ordering , but to the anisotropy induced in the surrounding 4@xmath6 states .",
    "although the latter is due , in principle , to the orbital ordering and/or associated jahn - teller distortion , this indirect dependence complicates the interpretation of k - edge rxs data .",
    "in fact , it has been first proposed that the measured anisotropy is determined by the 3@xmath7 orbital polarization via onsite 3@xmath74@xmath6 coulomb interaction.@xcite however , subsequent local - density - approximation ( lda ) calculations and lda plus onsite - coulomb interaction ( lda+u ) calculations , performed for a number of manganites@xcite and also for kcuf@xmath0,@xcite have provided rather strong evidence that the k - edge scattering amplitude in these systems is mostly sensitive to the jahn - teller distortion that accompanies the orbital ordering , rather than to the orbital ordering itself .    in kcuf@xmath0 , an interesting feature has been observed concerning the temperature dependence of the k - edge rxs intensity for orbital bragg peaks.@xcite the measured scattering intensity shows a substantial and sudden increase ( within 4 - 5 k ) , with decreasing temperature , when approaching the nel temperature .",
    "a somewhat similar phenomenon has been observed also in lamno@xmath0 at the k edge@xcite and in la@xmath8sr@xmath9mno@xmath10 at the @xmath4 edges,@xcite for temperatures approaching the nel temperature , but in these systems the changes in the orbital scattering intensity take place over a much wider temperature range , i.e. , one to two orders of magnitude wider .",
    "these phenomena are therefore not necessarily related , but they are all very puzzling , because they take place in a temperature region where both the orbital - order parameter and the jahn - teller distortion are expected to be saturated . in all of these systems ,",
    "the origin of the changes in the scattering intensity is an unresolved issue .    for kcuf@xmath0 ,",
    "two different interpretations have been proposed .",
    "on one hand , the change in rxs intensity has been ascribed to a change in the orbital order parameter , and interpreted as indicative of a strong coupling between spin and orbital degrees of freedom.@xcite on the other hand , based on the results of lda + u calculations showing a dominant influence of the jahn - teller distortion on the rxs spectra , the jump in intensity has been attributed to an increase of the jahn - teller distortion in the low - temperature magnetic phase.@xcite these interpretations are also not necessarily mutually exclusive ; a change in the magnetic structure may induce a change in the orbital - order parameter , which in turn may modify the jahn - teller distortion . in principle , first - principle calculations could help discriminating between these various possibilities by providing quantitative information on the influence of the magnetic structure on both , the jahn - teller distortion and the orbital - order parameter . as",
    "yet , however , to our knowledge these issues have not been addressed by such calculations for kcuf@xmath0 .    in the present work ,",
    "we use state - of - the - art lda+u calculations , based on _ ab initio _ pseudopotentials , to investigate the electronic , structural , and magnetic properties of kcuf@xmath0 .",
    "our main targets are the orbital ordering and jahn - teller distortion , and we address the influence of the magnetic structure on these properties .",
    "we also evaluate the cu k - edge rxs spectrum , and investigate the influence of the magnetic structure and jahn - teller distortion on the simulated spectrum . unlike other density - functional - related approaches , the lda+u method has not been extensively used to examine structural properties . in this study",
    "we therefore also first demonstrate the ability of lda + u pseudopotential calculations to provide a realistic description of the ground - state properties of kcuf@xmath0 , when full structural optimization is performed .",
    "kcuf@xmath0 crystallizes in a perovskite structure which is tetragonally distorted by a collective jahn - teller distortion of the cuf@xmath11 octahedra .",
    "two different polytypes have been identified experimentally at room temperature , which differ in their atomic - plane stacking along the @xmath12 axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cell]).@xcite the cu ions in kcuf@xmath0 are nominally in a cu@xmath13 ( d@xmath14 ) configuration , with completely filled @xmath1-@xmath15 orbitals and one hole in one of the cubic degenerate @xmath1-@xmath16 orbitals ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) .",
    "the cubic degeneracy of the @xmath16 states is lifted in the paramagnetic phase , well above room temperature , by an orbital polarization and jahn - teller instability .",

    "we note that the fact that @xmath106 ( and @xmath107 ) are very similar with and without the quadrupolar distortion indicates that , already at vanishing @xmath97 , the orbital ordering has essentially reached its saturation value , given the hybridization present in the system .    concerning the effect of the jahn - teller distortion , we observe that increasing @xmath97 by 50% increases noticeably the splitting between the two mean features in the rxs spectrum of the a - af structure , but does not change significantly the intensity of the dominant peak .",

    "<S> the orbital , lattice , and spin ordering phenomena in kcuf@xmath0 are investigated by means of lda+u calculations , based on _ ab initio _ pseudopotentials . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the cu-@xmath1 orbital ordering and the associated jahn - teller distortion in several different spin - ordered structures of kcuf@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state is correctly predicted to be an a - type antiferromagnetic structure , and the calculated jahn - teller distortion agrees also well with experiment . concerning the orbital ordering , we find that even for a highly ionic compound such as kcuf@xmath0 , the orbital - order parameter is significantly reduced with respect to its nominal value due to cu(@xmath1)f(@xmath2 ) hybridization . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate the cu k - edge resonant x - ray scattering spectra for bragg reflections associated with orbital order . </S>",
    "<S> consistent with previous studies , we find that the resonant signal is dominated by the structural anisotropy in the distribution of the f neighbors of the resonant cu atom , and that the cu-@xmath1 orbital ordering has only a minor influence on the spectra . our lda+u results , however , also indicate that a change in the magnetic structure has a small influence on the jahn - teller distortion , and hence on the resonant spectrum , in the conventional ( room - temperature ) crystallographic structure of kcuf@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this may indicate that the large change observed experimentally in the resonant signal near the nel temperature is related to a low - temperature structural transformation in kcuf@xmath0 . </S>"
