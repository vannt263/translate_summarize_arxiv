    "all qubit manipulations are achieved solely by the @xmath0-control pulse sequences of individual qubits .",
    "this removes the requirement of microwave @xmath5-control lines necessary in conventional transmon or similar qubit devices , simplifying classical control circuitry significantly .",
    "in addition , the encoded approach may allow lower requirements for available bandwidth per line , the potential for less crosstalk , and a reduction in needed timing accuracy as the encoded qubit states are nearly degenerate . removing the need for microwave control frees the choice of qubit frequency from the cost and availability of microwave electronics .",
    "one is then able to design physical qubits with higher ( or much lower ) frequency that might enable higher temperature qubit operation ( which may benefit from work already underway to enable high magnetic field compatible circuits for majorana experiments @xcite in higher-@xmath134 materials ) or qubits made from degenerate quantum circuits as in symmetry protected approaches @xcite , of which there is a natural connection to how spin qubits are inherently protected .",
    "encoding a qubit in a two - dimensional subspace in a larger hilbert space introduces leakage error . for our encoded qubits ,",
    "the relaxation process of individual transmons will lead to leakage out of the encoded qubit space . for a single gate operation such as cnot of duration @xmath125 , the leakage error due to the @xmath132 process would be @xmath135 0.04% for @xmath125=40ns and @xmath132=100@xmath136s , which would slightly reduce the error threshold for quantum error correction @xcite . while a single gate operation of a few tens of ns does not lead to significant leakage errors ,",
    "a long sequence of gate operations in a large system can be a problem .",
    "particularly , a single logical qubit for fault - tolerant quantum computing such as the surface code will consist of many encoded qubits and a logical operation will be a sequence of operations on those encoded qubits .",
    "therefore , leakage reduction units ( lru ) @xcite will likely be essential .",
    "for example , a full - lru based on one - bit teleportation @xcite would require an ancilla qubit for each encoded qubit and additional cnot operations and measurements after each logical cnot operation .",
    "qubits especially designed for large relaxation times , such as variants of fluxonium @xcite , may be particularly promising for our approach ( e.g. , a @xmath132 time of 1 ms would lead to a leakage error per cnot of 4@xmath137 ) and would reduce the overhead for leakage mitigation dramatically .",
    "the recently demonstrated capacitively - shunted flux qubits @xcite ( or  fluxmon \" ) may also provide a promising alternative .",
    "they have comparable coherence times and a larger anharmonicity than transmons .",
    "qubit - qubit coupling through mutual inductance would also provide transversal @xmath23 coupling like the capacitive coupling between transmon qubits , so the formalism used in this work should be applicable as well .",
    "they also offer benefits for initialization as they can be tuned to the flux qubit regime down to very small qubit splitting while being protected to @xmath132 processes that flux qubits offer , and readout can also be done by using a dc squid @xcite without a transmission line .    in the next phase of this design philosophy",
    "one can consider how to mimic other beneficial properties of spin qubits : very weak coupling between qubit states to charge noise and phonons , a fast and selective two - qubit gate via a pauli exclusion like mechanism or an interaction that mimics it , very large on / off ratios , and fast initialization via some as yet unknown method .",

    "<S> superconducting circuits offer tremendous design flexibility in the quantum regime culminating most recently in the demonstration of few qubit systems supposedly approaching the threshold for fault - tolerant quantum information processing . </S>",
    "<S> competition in the solid - state comes from semiconductor qubits , where nature has bestowed some very useful properties which can be utilized for spin qubit based quantum computing . here </S>",
    "<S> we begin to explore how selective design principles deduced from spin - based systems could be used to advance superconducting qubit science . </S>",
    "<S> we take an initial step along this path proposing an encoded qubit approach realizable with state - of - the - art tunable josephson junction qubits . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that this design philosophy holds promise , enables microwave - free control , and offers a pathway to future qubit designs with new capabilities such as with higher fidelity or , perhaps , operation at higher temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the approach is also especially suited to qubits based on variable super - semi junctions .    </S>",
    "<S> spin qubits @xcite are based on the fundamental and intrinsic properties of semiconductor systems , such as electron spins trapped in the potential of a quantum dot @xcite or a chemical impurity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> spins can be naturally protected from charge noise due to weak spin - orbit coupling . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the tiny matrix element between spin qubit states can allow spin qubits to operate at temperatures above the zeeman splitting @xcite . while a benefit to qubit coherence , this property of spins also leads to relatively slow single qubit gates via , for example , a microwave pulse . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that nature provides a solution : a very fast and robust two - qubit gate via the exchange interaction . </S>",
    "<S> this has led to `` encoded '' qubit schemes where the qubit is embedded logically in two to four physical spin qubits @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that electrons are real particles can be used for fast initialization and readout techniques . </S>",
    "<S> exchange - only qubits @xcite allow all electrical implementation of qubit gate operations and enable universal quantum computation ( qc ) while providing some immunity to global field and timing fluctuations via a decoherence free subsystem , at the cost of more physical qubits and extra operations per encoded gate .    </S>",
    "<S> this work investigates how superconducting ( sc ) josephson junction quantum circuits @xcite , whose properties can be engineered , can be improved by mimicking some of best properties of spin qubit systems . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a first step : an encoded superconducting qubit approach which does not require microwave control , and thus divorces qubit frequency from control electronics . in analogy to the exchange only qubit in semiconductor spin qubit systems , encoded qubits enable microwave - free control of the qubit states via fast dc - like voltage or flux pulses . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the exchange only qubits , logical gate operations of this encoded sc qubit can be done with minimal overhead ( zero overhead in physical 2-qubit gates ) in terms of control operations , a surprising result . </S>",
    "<S> we describe how to initialize the encoded qubit and implement single- and two - qubit logical gates using only @xmath0-control pulse sequences ( via tunable frequency qubits ) . in the process we also lay out possible opportunities for future research based on other insights from spin - based qc . to encourage implementation </S>",
    "<S> we give an explicit protocol based on qubits in operation today .    </S>",
    "<S> small systems of superconducting qubits based on variations of the transmon qubit @xcite have already demonstrated gates with fidelities approaching 99.99% along with rudimentary quantum algorithms including error correction cycles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that because these architectures rely on single qubit gates via microwaves , the future design space is constrained by the availability and convenience of microwave generators .    </S>",
    "<S> an alternative approach to combining the best properties of semiconductor and superconducting quantum systems is to take advantage of true superconducting - semiconductor systems . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of superconductivity in conventional semiconductors @xcite such as silicon @xcite or germanium @xcite could potentially allow for a new type of fully epitaxial super - semi devices @xcite . and </S>",
    "<S> epitaxial super - semi josephson juction devices based on the proximity effect have already led to new superconducting circuits @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> epitaxial super - semi systems may improve noise properties , but perhaps more importantly they enable gate - tunable josephson junctions , which we can also take advantage of in our proposal introduced below . </S>"
