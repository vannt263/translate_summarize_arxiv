    "detectors are used since a long time to detect ionizing radiation . among these , germanium detectors are extensively used for gamma spectroscopy , which requires full absorption of incoming radiation and high energy resolution .",
    "other semiconductor materials exist which can be used for the same purpose . as well known ,",
    "such detectors are generally readout with charge amplifiers , which convert the charge signals from the detector to voltage signals whose amplitude depends on the value of a known feedback capacitor @xcite . a charge amplifier for the readout of semiconductor detectors is generally made of an input jfet ( or mosfet ) selected for low noise , a second amplification stage , and the parallel combination of a capacitor and a large value resistor as the feedback elements . for the best noise performance",
    "the capacitance at the input node must be minimized , and thus the input jfet and the feedback components should ideally be placed very close to the detector .",
    "for some applications the classic configuration may present some drawbacks .",
    "if the detector is operated in a cryogenic environment ( as happens with germanium detectors ) and the circuit is placed close to the detector , then the circuit must operate at low temperature . while this is not generally a problem for the input jfet and the feedback components , provided that they are selected accordingly , it can complicate the design of the second stage , possibly preventing the use of some operational amplifiers .",
    "if several detectors are placed close to each other and the readout circuits have wide bandwidth , the power dissipation in the cryostat may be large .",
    "moreover , large power supply bypass capacitors may be required at cold to prevent disturbances or crosstalk from being injected through the supply voltages , especially in the case where the connecting cables are long and have a non negligible series resistance .",
    "high levels of radiation near the detectors may also require the electronic components to be radiation tolerant , and may prevent the operators from accessing the circuits for optimization or maintenance . in some cases",
    "it can thus be beneficial to separate the first stage , made of the jfet and the feedback components , from the second stage , with the aim of placing it in a less hostile environment . in the case of the classic charge",
    "sensitive amplifier this results in a bandwidth upper limit , since the cables connecting the first and second stage add capacitance to the feedback loop .",
    "even if the effect of cable capacitance is minimized by connecting the first and second stage with properly terminated transmission lines , the rise time of the signals can not be shorter than a few times the propagation delay along the cables , as will be discussed in the following .",
    "if the first and second stage of the charge amplifier are separated by a large distance but the high frequency signal components must be retained , a dual readout approach can be used .",
    "the `` slow '' output of a classic charge amplifier ( anyway optimized for the maximum achievable closed - loop bandwidth ) can be used to measure the total deposited charge , while a `` fast '' open loop output provides the complementary information at high frequency .",
    "the core ideas behind the `` fast '' output were already described in previous publications @xcite . in this paper",
    "several circuit improvements were introduced to overcome open issues related to small variations of the capacitance at the input node , which could be caused by variations in the counting rate or by mechanical vibrations .",
    "the improved circuit design is explained in this paper in thorough detail , and the results obtained with a prototype coupled to a small anode germanium detector , a canberra bege , are presented .",
    "the field which may benefit most from this circuit solution is that of rare event searches with germanium detectors , and particularly neutrinoless double beta decay search experiments such as gerda @xcite and majorana @xcite .",
    "the readout approach described in this paper was in fact developed in the framework of the r&d for the phase ii of the gerda experiment , and is then particularly tailored for such application .",
    "these experiments need extremely low background coming from the environment , including the detectors themselves and their readout electronics , in order to achieve the necessary sensitivity to the rare nuclear decays of interest .",
    "particular care must be taken in realizing a radiopure readout chain , and a means to this is to minimize the number of components close to the detectors by placing the second stage outside the cryostat , several meters away , while keeping the input jfet and the feedback components close to the detectors to satisfy the low noise requirements . at the same time , the small anode germanium detectors which these experiments plan to deploy allow to discriminate between different types of particle interactions by pulse shape analysis on the rise time of the signals , reducing the background in the energy region of interest @xcite .",
    "the readout circuit should then provide the necessary bandwidth of a few tens of mhz in order to preserve the charge collection profile in the detectors . anyway , as already mentioned , the design approach described in this paper can be applied in other fields , whenever a no - compromise solution with a minimal number of front - end components close to the detector may be of interest .",
    "the schematic of the proposed circuit solution is shown in figure [ fig : gefroschematic ] .",
    "it consists of a small front - end stage located close to the detector and a remote second stage located several meters away and connected to the first stage through terminated transmission lines .",
    "as already mentioned , the circuit was proposed for the phase ii of gerda , which employs germanium detectors operated in a cryogenic environment with low radioactive background , to which the readout electronics must comply . due to the dimensions of the cryostat , the distance between the detectors and the room where the second stage electronics could be placed is about ten meters .",
    "the front - end stage is composed of a jfet @xmath0 and the feedback elements @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the input jfet is operated in common source configuration and is located close to the detector to minimize the stray input capacitance , so it should be chosen to have low noise at cryogenic temperature .",
    "several devices are commercially available for such purpose from many manufacturers . due to the radiopurity constraints of our application ,",
    "our choice was narrowed to the devices which could be purchased in bare silicon die . at a few ma of bias current , most of the jfets tested at low temperature have a transconductance of about per pf of input capacitance . in order to have a transconductance larger than , necessary to drive the signal on a terminated transmission line without significant gain loss ,",
    "the resulting input capacitance from @xmath0 is at least . in the case where the detector capacitance is much smaller",
    ", it would then be convenient to work in mismatch conditions , with the input capacitance dominated by @xmath0 . in the measurements presented in the following sections a sf291 jfet from semefab",
    "was used as @xmath0 , featuring a transconductance at and , measured at with a keithley 4200 semiconductor analyzer .",
    "its gate capacitance of was instead evaluated from the amplitude of the `` fast '' gefro signal , as will be described in section [ sec : sigosc ] . in the measurements with the bege detector presented in this paper ,",
    "the total input capacitance @xmath3 was close to , mainly contributed by the input jfet and parasitics . at dc , assuming @xmath4 , the drain of @xmath0 is held at @xmath5 by the feedback loop through @xmath6 , and its bias current is given by @xmath7 . in our case , , then gives for @xmath0 a bias current of .",
    "notably , the bias voltage and current of the input transistor can be tuned by acting on the second stage , without direct access to the front - end .",
    "the dc voltage on the feedback line is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the gate voltage of the polarized jfet and @xmath10 is the total current flowing through @xmath1 , given by the sum of the leakage currents from the detector and from the jfet . in our measurements @xmath10",
    "was contributed by the current in the detector , a few pa at low event rates , and by the gate current of the jfet at , much less than .    concerning the feedback components , the values chosen for our prototype are , ( @xmath2 already includes the parasitic contributions due to @xmath1 and layout ) .",
    "in the first version of the gefro , as reported in @xcite , only a schottky diode was used as the feedback element , which served at the same time as the ( non linear ) large value resistor and capacitor .",
    "it was then found difficult to find a schottky diode with a high degree of radiopurity , while on the contrary silicon resistors in bare die of high radiopurity were found to be commercially available , with values ranging up to ( mstf 6ss-15005 j - e from mini - systems , inc . ) .",
    "three of such resistors can be used in series to obtain a feedback resistor of the required value .",
    "if a resistor is used for @xmath1 then the schottky diode is no longer necessary .",
    "a normal silicon diode of low capacitance , which can be easily found in bare die , can be used at the input to protect the jfet against negative overvoltages which may occur if the high voltage bias of the detector is decreased too fast . if the diode needs a negative reference voltage , which would require an additional cable to the front - end stage . as an alternative",
    ", the protection diode can be connected in parallel with @xmath1 ( and biased with in this case ) , but in that case the capacitance of the diode should be considered in parallel with @xmath2 in the following evaluations . anyway ,",
    "if the capacitance of the detector is negligible with respect to the input capacitance due to the jfet and parasitics , as happens with small anode detectors such as the canberra bege , then accidental negative overvoltages at the input are strongly attenuated , and the diode can be omitted .",
    "for this reason it will not be considered in the rest of this paper .",
    "the schematic of figure [ fig : gefroschematic ] also shows the line used to inject a test signal through the test capacitance @xmath11 located close to the input node , whose value was .",
    "if the test signal is a voltage step of amplitude @xmath12 , a current pulse carrying a known charge @xmath13 is generated .",
    "a signal from the detector is a current pulse carrying a given amount of charge @xmath14 .",
    "the feedback loop has a finite bandwidth , and has no effect on the first part of the signals . on the fast transient ,",
    "the current signal is integrated on the input capacitance @xmath3 and becomes a voltage step at the input of @xmath0 .",
    "the jfet converts this voltage step at the input to a current step at its output , which is driven into a terminated signal line of characteristic impedance @xmath15 to avoid reflections .",
    "if the drain of the jfet can be approximated as an ideal current source ( which is true if its drain - source resistance and gate - drain capacitance can be neglected ) then the output signal is insensitive to the series resistance of the output line , which can be as high as a few @xmath16/m if coaxial cables of small section are used .",
    "the line termination @xmath15 is ac coupled through @xmath17 .",
    "its value is expected to be , depending on the choice of cables . in the rest of the paper a characteristic impedance of",
    "will be considered .",
    "the signal across @xmath15 is amplified by the fast voltage amplifier @xmath18 and constitutes the `` fast '' signal , expressed by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the gain of @xmath18 , @xmath21 is the transconductance of @xmath0 , and @xmath22 is the time constant related to the discharge of the input node after each event , which gives the fall time constant of the `` fast '' signal .",
    "the value of @xmath23 is determined by the bandwidth of the feedback loop , while the value of @xmath24 is determined by the length of the cables connecting the first and second stage , as will be calculated in the following sections .",
    "for stability constraints it will be shown that @xmath23 must always be a few times larger than @xmath24 .",
    "the rise time of the `` fast '' signal is determined by the bandwidth of the signal cables and of @xmath18 . in our prototype @xmath18",
    "was based on a lt6230 - 10 operational amplifier from linear , chosen for low voltage noise and large bandwidth , operated at a gain of ( , ) and externally compensated with to obtain a bandwidth of about .",
    "the output of the lt6230 - 10 was amplified by a ad811 operational amplifier from analog devices with a gain of ( , ) , so that the `` fast '' signal at the output of the second stage could be driven over a terminated transmission line ( ) with an overall gain .    on a longer time scale",
    "the feedback loop becomes effective , forcing the discharge of the input node through the feedback components @xmath2 and @xmath1 . to do this",
    "the feedback amplifier @xmath6 injects a charge through @xmath2 which counterbalances the input charge @xmath14 .",
    "when the input node is discharged , a voltage @xmath25 is found across @xmath2 , which then discharges through @xmath1 with time constant @xmath26 .",
    "the gain and bandwidth of @xmath6 are determined by @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "acting on their values allows to tune @xmath23 to assure the stability of the feedback loop .",
    "the fall time of the `` fast '' signal @xmath30 coincides with the rise time of the feedback signal @xmath31 , which constitutes the `` slow '' signal .",
    "the feedback amplifier in our prototype was a ad797 operational amplifier from analog devices , chosen for low voltage noise , low dc offset and relatively large bandwidth .",
    "the resistor @xmath32 is used to terminate the feedback line on its characteristic impedance at one end , avoiding reflections which may impact stability .",
    "if the signal and feedback cables have the same characteristic impedance , then @xmath33 . neglecting the dc voltage on the feedback line , the `` slow '' signal in response to a charge @xmath14 is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 , that is the signal of a classic charge amplifier with bandwidth limited to @xmath36 .",
    "it should be noted that the gain of the `` slow '' signal depends mainly on the value of @xmath2 .",
    "the input capacitance @xmath3 affects the value of @xmath23 , as will be shown , but the effect on the signal amplitude is a second order contribution if and the shaping is slow enough with respect to @xmath23 .",
    "so , even if its bandwidth is smaller with respect to the `` fast '' signal , the `` slow '' signal can give a more precise and reliable estimate of the input charge @xmath14 in the case where the capacitance @xmath3 fluctuates .",
    "the `` fast '' and `` slow '' signals are schematically depicted in figure [ fig : gefroexpectedsignals ] for input pulses carrying a positive charge @xmath14 . in a general application",
    ", both waveforms can be acquired at the same time .",
    "the `` fast '' signal can be used to resolve the charge collection profile in the detector , while the `` slow '' signal can be used for energy measurement . in the following sections the conditions for the stability of the loop gain will be considered and the validity of equations ( [ eq : v1(t)1 ] ) and ( [ eq : v2(t)1 ] ) will be demonstrated .",
    "let us first consider the transfer function of the amplifier @xmath6 with its feedback components @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in the domain of the complex frequency @xmath37 the transfer function of the open loop operational amplifier with a dominant pole can be modeled as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the open loop gain at dc and @xmath40 is the frequency of the dominant pole . as well known , the gain - bandwidth product of the amplifier is @xmath41 , where . the closed loop transfer function is then @xmath42 equation ( [ eq : g2(s)1 ] ) was obtained by approximating for @xmath4 and is valid in the range of frequencies @xmath43 where @xmath44 since the dominant pole of the operational amplifier is at very low frequency , the second inequality in ( [ eq:1/cprqgg ] ) is easily satisfied . the first inequality in ( [ eq:1/cprqgg ] ) will instead be verified once the values for @xmath27 and @xmath29 will be chosen .",
    "let us now consider the entire feedback loop between the first and second stage .",
    "the loop gain @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 the first term is due to @xmath1 , which forms a pole with the total input capacitance to ground @xmath3 and a zero with the feedback capacitance @xmath2 .",
    "the expression was approximated for @xmath47 , which is certainly true with the values given in the previous section .",
    "the second term is due to the gain of the jfet on the total impedance it sees at its output .",
    "this term contributes with a pole at @xmath48 and a zero at @xmath49 .",
    "this term was approximated for @xmath50 , which is allowed if and as in our case .",
    "the third term is due to the feedback amplifier @xmath6 , as calculated above .",
    "the last exponential term represents the phase shift introduced by the propagation delay @xmath24 along the signal and feedback lines . assuming both lines to have length @xmath51 , the propagation delay is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the propagation delay per unit length . if and then .",
    "the components whose values at this point are not fixed by other constraints are @xmath17 , @xmath28 , @xmath27 and @xmath29 .",
    "let us choose @xmath17 to be very large , say . with the values given above , , , .",
    "above a few hundred hz the loop gain can then be approximated as @xmath54 we can now choose @xmath28 so that @xmath55 with such choice equation ( [ eq : t(s)2 ] ) simplifies to @xmath56 if we now define @xmath57 the loop gain ( [ eq : t(s)3 ] ) can then be written as @xmath58 the loop gain clearly shows a dominant pole at low frequency , and a phase shift term related to the propagation delay along the transmission lines which connect the first and the second stage .",
    "this simplified expression is valid in the range of frequencies shown in figure [ fig : gefropolesandzeroes ] .    as an alternative condition ,",
    "the loop gain expressed by ( [ eq : t(s)2 ] ) can be approximated by letting @xmath59 . in this case , at frequencies larger than @xmath60 ( that is , above a few khz ) the loop gain can still be written as ( [ eq : t(s)4 ] ) where @xmath23 is now defined as @xmath61 in most of the measurements presented in this paper the first case will be preferred , that is @xmath28 satisfying ( [ eq : cfrf ] ) , but the following evaluations on the stability of the loop gain apply also to the case where @xmath59 . as can be clearly seen , in both cases @xmath23",
    "can be tuned by changing the values of @xmath27 and @xmath29 .",
    "let us now consider the stability of the loop gain . at dc",
    "the loop gain as given by ( [ eq : t(s)2 ] ) is a negative real number , or in other words the phase of @xmath62 is 0@xmath63 . the critical frequency to determine the stability of the feedback loop is that",
    "for which , that is @xmath64 the closed loop transfer function is proportional to @xmath65 .",
    "if the phase of @xmath62 at @xmath66 becomes too close to 180@xmath63 , the overall loop gain turns positive and instability occurs .",
    "the difference between @xmath67 and the phase of @xmath62 at @xmath66 gives the phase margin , that is @xmath68 in case of short signal and feedback lines the last term in ( [ eq : phit1 ] ) is negligible .",
    "the phase margin is close to 90@xmath63 and stability is assured .",
    "if the signal and feedback lines are long , then the additional phase shift due to the propagation delay on both lines can affect stability .",
    "assuming the distance @xmath51 between the first and second stage to be fixed , the condition for a phase margin @xmath69 larger than 60@xmath63 leads to a lower value for @xmath23 , that is @xmath70 the loop gain is then stable provided that the condition ( [ eq : taul3 ] ) is satisfied . this can be achieved by properly choosing the value of @xmath23 by tuning the values of @xmath27 and @xmath29 according to equation ( [ eq : taul1 ] ) or ( [ eq : taul2 ] ) . the evaluation of the phase shift introduced by the propagation delay along the cables is correct as long as both the signal and feedback lines are terminated at least at one end , in order to avoid multiple reflections . in the schematic of figure [ fig : gefroschematic ]",
    "both lines are terminated at the second stage , which seems the most convenient thing to do .",
    "if either one of the lines were not terminated , the reflections back and forth would bear a larger phase shift than that given by the exponential term in @xmath45 , and the phase margin would be reduced , resulting in a more stringent lower limit for @xmath23 .",
    "let us now derive the `` fast '' signal shape , as expressed by equation ( [ eq : v1(t)1 ] ) . neglecting the feedback , and by approximating for frequencies above @xmath71 , the open loop signal at the `` fast '' output in response to an instantaneous current pulse carrying a charge @xmath14 in the complex frequency domain is given by @xmath72 where , as already discussed",
    ", @xmath3 is the total input capacitance and @xmath21 is the transconductance of @xmath0 . equation ( [ eq : v1ol(s)1 ] ) was obtained by approximating for @xmath50 , and by considering the drain of the jfet as an ideal current source . in the real case the output impedance of the jfet , contributed by its drain - source resistance and gate - drain capacitance , should be included in the calculations .",
    "its effect on the overall gain is a second order contribution and will not be considered here .",
    "equation ( [ eq : v1ol(s)1 ] ) also neglects the propagation delay due to the signal line length , which is a simple time shift of @xmath73 .",
    "as well known from feedback theory , the open loop signal @xmath74 expressed by equation ( [ eq : v1ol(s)1 ] ) is modified by the presence of the feedback loop according to the relation @xmath75 since the feedback loop is ineffective for frequencies above @xmath76 , and @xmath77 for stability , the denominator of ( [ eq : v1(s)2 ] ) can be approximated as @xmath78 the first term derives from a first order expansion of the exponential at frequencies smaller than @xmath79 .",
    "the second term was introduced in order to satisfy the condition @xmath80 that is required since the feedback loop is ineffective at frequencies larger than @xmath81 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : v1(s)2 ] ) then becomes @xmath82 by taking the inverse laplace transform of the above , one obtains the `` fast '' output signal expressed by equation ( [ eq : v1(t)1 ] ) .",
    "this first order approximation loses accuracy when @xmath23 is small and comparable to @xmath24 . in this case",
    "a second order expansion improves the accuracy , as shown in the appendix .",
    "let us now derive equation ( [ eq : v2(t)1 ] ) , which gives the shape of the feedback signal or `` slow '' output .",
    "if we consider the loop gain to be infinite , the input node is held at virtual ground and all the charge flows into @xmath2 .",
    "the signal in this case would then be given by @xmath83 again , the time shift due to the propagation delay along the cable was neglected .",
    "its effect on bandwidth is considered through the feedback loop gain @xmath45 . since the feedback loop has a finite gain and bandwidth , the actual closed loop signal differs from ( [ eq : v2il(s ) ] ) .",
    "as well known from feedback theory it can be calculated as @xmath84 by using equation ( [ eq : t(s)4 ] ) for @xmath45 we have that @xmath85 where again the exponential was approximated at first order for frequencies below @xmath79 , but a term @xmath86 at the numerator was dropped in order to satisfy the condition @xmath87 that is required since the `` slow '' signal does not contain high frequencies above the bandwidth of the feedback loop .",
    "equation ( [ eq : v2(s)1 ] ) then becomes @xmath88 where @xmath35 . by taking the inverse laplace",
    "transform we obtain the `` slow '' output signal as expressed by equation ( [ eq : v2(t)1 ] ) .",
    "again , a second order approximation can be considered to improve the accuracy for @xmath23 close to @xmath24 , and is presented in the appendix .",
    "as a first test of the validity of the above evaluations , the circuit was operated with the smallest possible value for @xmath23 .",
    "the input capacitance was due mainly to the input jfet .",

    "the values , , were chosen .",
    "the gain - bandwidth product of the ad797 chosen for @xmath6 is . with such choices , which makes its contribution negligible with respect to @xmath27 in ( [ eq : taul2 ] ) .",

    "a more detailed discussion of noise and energy resolution will be given in the following sections .",

    "after substracting the latter we are left with about , that is compatible with a value for the 1/f noise coefficient of .",
    "when the gain of the first stage is brought back to the original value with @xmath99 50 @xmath16 , the noise from the second stage must be considered . in our case , so the noise from the termination resistor @xmath15 , of the resistor @xmath29 and of the second stage amplifier should be considered at the input divided by and summed in quadrature to the noise contribution of the jfet in the evaluation of the overall series noise .",
    "the resistor @xmath29 contributes with at the input , while @xmath15 contributes with .",
    "the white voltage noise from @xmath6 referred to the input of @xmath0 is about .",
    "the current noise of @xmath18 and @xmath6 , about in both cases , would also add to the series noise , but their contribution is negligible since the impedance @xmath15 seen at their inputs is small .",
    "the total white voltage noise at the input is then close to , which at with an input capacitance of gives about . with a proper choice of the amplifier @xmath6",
    ", its 1/f voltage and current noise can be neglected .",
    "the same is true for the current noise contribution from @xmath18 .",
    "even if the gain of the first stage is only 1.7 , the contribution of the second stage is then small compared to that of the first stage , as can be clearly seen from the green curve of figure [ fig : gefronoisevstau ] , which is only slightly above the blue curve .",
    "finally , a capacitor was added at the input to simulate the detector , obtaining the red curve in figure [ fig : gefronoisevstau ] . from the comparison of this curve with the others in the same figure ,",
    "it is clearly evident that with a total input capacitance of at shaping time the equivalent noise charge of the shaped `` slow '' signal is dominated by the 1/f series noise of the input jfet , and is close to .",
    "the equivalent noise charge of , as results from the previous section , corresponds in germanium to a fwhm resolution of about .",
    "this can be verified in the spectrum shown in figure [ fig : gefrospectrum ] , taken by facing the bege detector with a @xmath89th gamma source .",
    "the resolution of the pulser line set at is , higher than expected , most likely due to some small disturbance injected through the high voltage power supply for the detector .",
    "the result is anyway remarkable .",
    "the resolution of the and lines is and respectively , as expected from the poisson statistics compensated by the fano factor in germanium , summed in quadrature with the electronic noise .",
    "the spectrum was taken over an hour with an overall event rate of about 800 counts per second .",
    "the drift in the position of the and lines versus time is shown in figure [ fig : gefrodrift ] .",
    "the figure shows a continuous drift for both lines close to , likely related with the evaporation of liquid nitrogen in the dewar housing the detector , which was not refilled in 44 hours , and a daily periodic trend , related with small temperature and humidity variations at the second stage .",
    "curiously the daily variations for the two lines are not in phase . in any case , the measurement shows a very good overall stability in the position of the peaks , better than about over 44 hours of measurement .",
    "the readout chain for semiconductor detectors presented in this paper provides a novel way to solve the trade - off between wide bandwidth , high energy resolution and the requirement of a minimal number of front - end components close to the detector . by acquiring both",
    "the `` fast '' and the `` slow '' outputs of the gefro all the relevant information from the detector signals can be retrieved .",
    "the design approach of the gefro circuit was described in detail , together with the criteria for component selection and the trade - offs involved .",
    "the circuit was tested with a canberra bege detector demonstrating a high timing resolution at the `` fast '' output , enough to clearly resolve the charge collection profiles in the detector for single - site and multi - site events . at the same time",
    "the spectra measured from the shaped `` slow '' output provided high resolution and very reliable operation , with a negligible drift in peak position over several hours .",
    "these features make the gefro circuit particularly suitable for rare event searches with semiconductor detectors , and in particular for the neutrinoless double beta decay search experiments gerda and majorana .    here",
    "the calculations for the shape of the `` fast '' output will be carried out to a second order approximation in @xmath100 . by approximating the loop gain ( [ eq : t(s)4 ] ) at the second order in @xmath100 , and without introducing normalization factors , we obtain @xmath101 by plugging this into ( [ eq : v1(s)2 ] ) , the `` fast '' signal takes the form @xmath102 let us now consider the limit case which satisfies ( [ eq : taul3 ] ) , that is @xmath103 .",
    "the above equation becomes @xmath104 the inverse laplace transform gives @xmath105 the signal expressed by ( [ eq : v1(t)2 ] ) reaches its maximum value at @xmath106 , that is about if .",
    "its amplitude at @xmath107 is @xmath108 its 10% to 90% rise time is , its 90% to 10% fall time is . the signal in ( [ eq : v1(t)2 ] ) has a small undershoot below ground , less than 5% of the total amplitude . concerning the `` slow '' signal , from ( [ eq : v2(s)1 ] ) and",
