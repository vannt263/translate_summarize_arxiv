    "we will write @xmath1600 for the affine dg scheme associated to @xmath597 , to match this situation with that of usual schemes .",
    "philosophically , the approach of definition [ def : dg scheme ] can be summarized by saying that we ignore topological subtleties of dg schemes , and simply endow them with the topology coming from @xmath1598 .",
    "the natural definition of quasi - coherent sheaves is : @xmath1601 all of the dg schemes in this paper will be of finite type , meaning that @xmath597 is finitely generated over @xmath1599 .",
    "since this is the case , it is natural to define coherent - sheaves as the full subcategory : @xmath1602 consisting of dg modules whose cohomology groups are coherent sheaves over @xmath1599 .",
    "suppose that @xmath1603 $ ] is the koszul complex associated to a coherent sheaf @xmath1604 and a co - section @xmath40 .",
    "explicitly , we have : @xmath1605\\ ] ] the structure sheaf @xmath1598 situated in degree 0 , as in example [ ex : important ] , upgraded to the situation of modules .",
    "if the co - section @xmath40 is regular , then it is well - known that the koszul complex is acyclic , and the dg algebra @xmath597 becomes isomorphic to the usual commutative algebra @xmath1606 . in this case",
    ", the dg scheme is simply the subscheme of @xmath132 cut out by the section @xmath40 .",
    "however , in general it may be that the section @xmath40 is not regular ( for example , @xmath40 could be 0 ) . in this case",
    ", the dg algebra @xmath1607 has 0 differential but non - trivial grading .",
    "explicitly : @xmath1608 in particular , if @xmath1609 is a free module , the choice of the datum @xmath158 corresponds to @xmath7 commuting degree @xmath365 endomorphisms of @xmath1610 .",
    "in general , the affine dg schemes we will encounter will combine the previous example with the case of polynomial rings over ordinary algebras .",
    "specifically , we will have : @xmath1611 = \\left [ ... \\stackrel{d_s}\\longrightarrow \\wedge^2 { \\mathcal{m}}\\otimes s_x{\\mathcal{n}}\\stackrel{d_s}\\longrightarrow { \\mathcal{m}}\\otimes s_x{\\mathcal{n}}\\stackrel{d_s}\\longrightarrow s_x{\\mathcal{n}}\\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath1612 is a map of coherent sheaves of @xmath132 .",
    "the differential @xmath1613 is given by , and the grading has @xmath1614 sitting in degree @xmath1615 . but note that there is an extra grading on the algebra @xmath597 , given by placing @xmath1616 in degree @xmath1617 .",
    "we will write this as : @xmath1618",
    "since the @xmath1619 grading is preserved by the differential @xmath1613 , it descends to a grading on the cohomology groups .",
    "for example , when the morphism @xmath40 is regular ( i.e. when the koszul complex @xmath597 is acyclic in negative degrees ) , the @xmath908 grading collapses , and the @xmath1266 grading matches the usual polynomial grading on the symmetric power @xmath1620 .",
    "let us make two remarks : first of all , an object in @xmath1623 has two gradings .",
    "the first comes from the power @xmath1266 of the symmetric power , and the second comes from the dg grading on @xmath1621 .",
    "secondly , the difference between a projectivization and the affine cone @xmath1624 is the same as in the classical case : there is , in the derived category of the former , an additional quasi - isomorphism between the structure sheaf of the zero section and the zero module .      as in example",
    "[ ex : proj dg ] , let us study the case when @xmath1625 $ ] is a two step complex of vector bundles , concentrated in degrees @xmath365 and @xmath366 . in this case",
    ", we have a map : @xmath1626 where the map @xmath318 is an actual projective bundle since @xmath1604 is a vector bundle on @xmath132 .",
    "the symbol @xmath1627 emulates closed embeddings of schemes , because we tautologically have : @xmath1628 \\right ) \\cong\\ ] ] @xmath1629 \\big\\}\\ ] ] with this in mind , we think of @xmath1630 $ ] as the dg subscheme of @xmath1631 cut out by the cosection @xmath40 of the vector bundle @xmath1632 .",
    "our main example [ ex : proj dg ] should be interpreted as a dg version of the familiar notion of projective bundles @xmath1633 , where @xmath819 is a rank @xmath7 locally free sheaf of @xmath132 . in this case , recall the following formulas : @xmath1634 @xmath1635 for all @xmath1636 , where @xmath395 denotes the derived pull - back .",
    "the second equality follows from the first one , together with * relative serre duality * : @xmath1637 for all @xmath1638 .",
    "we now prove a similar formula in the dg setting        implicitly in equation , one has the equation : @xmath1643 \\right)\\ ] ] applying to the right hand side , we obtain @xmath1644^\\vee \\otimes \\wedge^\\text{top } { \\mathcal{n}}^\\vee(-n ) \\right)^\\vee\\ ] ] it is easy to see that @xmath1645^\\vee = \\wedge^{\\bullet+m } \\left[\\pi^*{\\mathcal{m}}(-1 ) \\stackrel{s}\\rightarrow { \\mathcal{o}}\\right ] \\otimes \\wedge^{\\text{top}}{\\mathcal{m}}^\\vee(m)$ ] , hence : @xmath1646 \\otimes \\frac { \\wedge^{\\text{top}}{\\mathcal{n}}(-n)}{\\wedge^{\\text{top}}{\\mathcal{m}}(-m ) } \\right)^\\vee\\ ] ] which equals @xmath1647 by another application of ."
