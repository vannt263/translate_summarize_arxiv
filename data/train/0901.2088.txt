    "the phenomenon of mutual coupling of magnetic layers separated by a nonmagnetic medium has been of great interest since its discovery in fe / cr structure,@xcite both due to its immense application potential and the highly nontrivial physical background.@xcite . in parallel to studies of metallic systems , the progress in the field of thin films made of diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) , such as the most representative ( ga , mn)as , offers some new possibilities to study the diluted magnetic systems with confined geometry .",
    "such materials are promising from the future spintronics point of view ,  @xcite since they can assure integrability of novel spin - current devices with conventional structures of semiconductor - based electronics.@xcite in dms an indirect coupling between localized spins mediated by charge carriers is of paramount importance for the possibility of magnetic ordering .",
    "the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction mechanism was suggested to describe the properties of quantum - well based dms systems a decade ago .",
    "@xcite    the problem of interlayer coupling in multilayers and superlattices of dms has been subject to various theoretical studies .",
    "_ et al.__@xcite performed some calculations within a single parabolic band approximation for @xmath0 method and local density approximation to study the possibility of the appearence of antiferromagnetic ( af ) interlayer coupling in the superlattices of ( ga , mn)as . they concluded that the minimization of spacer thickness accompanied with relatively short superlattice period is advantageous for a strong coupling .",
    "this problem has also been investigated by sankowski and kacman ,  @xcite who found in their tight binding - based study a relative insensitivity of the coupling energy to the magnetic layer thickness . a noticeable range of parameters favourizing the af interlayer interaction has been identified .",
    "the self - consistent mean - field calculations for multilayers were also performed by jungwirth _ _ et al.__@xcite    numerous experimental works evidenced the fact that two magnetically doped layers can be indirectly coupled for some interlayer distances .",
    "for example , such a coupling has been observed in ( ga , mn)as / gaas trilayers by means of magnetotransport and magnetization process studies by akiba _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite , where the quantitative analysis was performed yielding the ferromagnetic ( f ) interlayer couplings close to 0.1 mj / m@xmath1 for the nonmagnetic spacer up to 10 ml thick .",
    "the superlattice structures of the same dms have been investigated by mathieu _ _ et al.__@xcite , where the critical temperature was found to oscillate with the spacer thickness ( up to 9 ml ) and thus the presence of interlayer coupling was deduced .",
    "short - period superlattices formed the basis of neutron reflectivity studies of szuszkiewicz _ _ et al.__@xcite , who confirmed the ferromagnetic - only interlayer coupling ( mainly for 6 ml spacer ) . in the work of kirby _",
    "et al_.@xcite neutron reflectometry and magnetization curve studies of trilayer structures were performed , in which the magnetization of top and bottom layer has been resolved .",
    "this indicated distinct ferromagnetic coupling through a spacer of large thickness ( about 20 ml ) .",
    "it was also excluded that the spacer has been plagued by diffusion of the magnetic impurities leading to direct coupling mechanism . on the other hand , the results of ge _ _ et al.__@xcite show the difference of critical temperatures for top and bottom layer in a trilayer system , a difference which had a tendency to vanish when the nonmagnetic spacer thickness was reduced ( and a single common transition temperature has been observed for the spacer of about 10 ml thick ) .",
    "let us note that in that paper it has been stated that the sign of coupling energy might be spatially inhomogenous - either f or af for various areas on the surface of the sample , which was deduced from the observation of planar hall effect .",
    "however , it was not until last year that the af coupling between layers in ( ga , mn)as / gaas : be was clearly observed by means of dc magnetometry as well as neutron reflectivity studies performed by chung _",
    "et al_.@xcite the critical temperature of the system was about 50 k. all the discussed interlayer coupling signatures have been assigned to the carrier - mediated interaction mechanism .",
    "the above results encourage for further search for the possibility of obtaining af interlayer carrier - mediated coupling .",
    "therefore , it seems purposeful to devote a theoretical study to the trilayer structure , which can be formed by two magnetic layers immersed in the thin film and separated by a nonmagnetic spacer , with the aim to discover some unique properties of rkky interaction in the ultrathin film . from the practical point of view",
    "it is interesting to find a range of carrier concentrations and geometric characteristics with af coupling . in particular",
    ", the influence of the magnetic layer thickness on the coupling energy and the critical temperature of the system poses an important question . in order to have a deeper insight , also",
    "the spatial distribution of magnetization within the magnetic layers appears worth - while to examine .    for the above reasons , in this paper our purpose is to study a model trilayer system with the rkky interaction .",

    "the contact potential frequently used in derivation of rkky indirect exchange integral is reproduced in the limit @xmath21 .",
    "such a form of the formula ( [ eq : contactpotential ] ) is further substantiated by the fact that the localized magnetic moments originate from the @xmath11-type electronic orbitals which possess some spatial extension .",

    "in general , for non - zero temperature , the magnetizations @xmath76 per one magnetic impurity in each magnetically doped plane are not equal for all @xmath51 , so that some spatial magnetization profile is present in the magnetic layers . in the molecular field approximation ( mfa )",

    "since the existence and characteristic of rkky interaction essentially depend on the electronic structure of the system under consideration , we make it a point of a brief discussion for the ultrathin film .",
    "confining the charge carriers in a quantum well results in discretization of the fermi surface , which for such a system is composed of a finite number of circular slices , each of them corresponding to one 2d energy subband .",
    "the detailed description of the electronic structure of an ultrathin film is presented in ref .  .",
    "in the fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2 ] , the crucial quantity for studies of electronic properties , namely the density of states ( dos ) at fermi level is plotted against the number of monolayers which make up the whole film .",
    "the method of calculating dos for an ultrathin film has been presented in details in ref .  .",
    "in further studies we make use of a normalized charge carriers concentration @xmath98 . in the main plot , it is assumed that the number of charge carriers in the film is fixed and their normalized concentration equals @xmath99 , thus carrier concentration decreases when the film is made thicker .",
    "this assumption corresponds to the situation in which only two out of @xmath4 atomic planes contain impurities which serve as charge donors , and the concentration of impurities within each doped plane is equal to @xmath50 .",
    "three impurity concentrations were selected , namely @xmath1000.025 , 0.050 and 0.075 all belonging to the physically relevant range in dms .",
    "for the inset we chose constant @xmath101 , which is valid when all the atomic planes are doped with concentration @xmath50 . for convenience ,",
    "the values of dos were normalized to the corresponding values for the bulk case ( for the appropriate value of @xmath102 ) .",
    "+ it is visible that dos undergoes discontinuous jumps at some values of @xmath4 .",
    "this is clear manifestation of quantum size effects ( qse ) as each of the jumps occurs for the charge carrier concentration at which the next energy subband becomes occupied by the carriers , starting from a single 2d - like subband for the lowest concentrations .",
    "although @xmath102 is inversely proportional to the film thickness , the number of occupied energy subbands increases while increasing @xmath4 .",
    "the distance between subsequent jumps becomes shorter by increasing the concentration @xmath50 of charge carrier donors . between the jumps ,",
    "normalized dos decreases as @xmath103 , which reflects the fact that for a thin film the total dos is a sum of ( equal ) contributions from each occupied 2d - like subband .",
    "this 2d - like dos per one charge carrier is energy - independent , so that dividing by the 3d dos per one charge carrier ( proportional to @xmath104 ) yields this behaviour . the dependence presented in the main plot in fig .",

    ", we can expect similar discontinuous bahaviour of other physical properties which depend crucially on the dos at the fermi level .",

    "having a special case of the formula ( [ eq : interlayer2 ] ) for @xmath75 ( as in ref . ) , we can study the interplanar coupling energies @xmath107 . in the formula ( [ eq : sum ] ) , the summation of exchange integrals over the in - plane coordination zones has to be performed .",
    "some cut - off radius must be assumed , large enough to assure satisfactory convergency of @xmath108 .",
    "it should also be emphasized that calculating each value of exchange integral @xmath109 constitutes a remarkable numerical task itself .",
    "therefore , a noticeable computational effort is required to study the inter- and intralayer interaction energies so that we performed our calculations on the multi - cpu cluster .",
    "we performed the summation up to @xmath1101000 coordination zones ( which corresponds to the cut - off radius @xmath111=82.0 for even interplanar distances and @xmath111=86.8 for odd interplanar distances ) .",
    "in addition , we applied some averaging intended to remove the component oscillatory in cut - off radius .",
    "such a procedure provides sufficient convergency of the resulting energies .",
    "let us emphasize that accepting a finite spatial extension of an interaction potential ( [ eq : exchange ] ) is necessary to obtain finite interplanar coupling since the formulas contain the exchange integral @xmath112 which would be divergent otherwise .",
    "in further calculations we assumed @xmath113=0.35 , which could correspond to 1 @xmath114 for ( ga , mn)as ( which we assume to be a realistic estimate of the spatial extension of @xmath11 orbital carrying the localized spin ) .    it is interesting to follow the evolution of the energy dependence on interplanar distance when the film thickness @xmath4 increases .",
    "we make an assumption that the charge carrier concentration is @xmath99 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] we present @xmath115 as dependent on interplanar distance for various @xmath4 and for @xmath105 .",
    "it is remarkable that all the curves are symmetric with respect to the centre of the film , i.e. @xmath116 .",
    "it is a result of the similar symmetry of the rkky coupling integral in ultrathin film ( note that the symmetry properties of a rkky coupling for a thin film have been mentioned first in the work of wojtczak@xcite ) .",
    "let us remember that the summation over coordination zones within the atomic plane can be performed using the two sets of coordination radii and coordination numbers different for odd and even values of @xmath63 .",
    "however , for low values of charge carrier concentration the inverse of the fermi wavevector is quite large and we are in the quasi - continuous regime so that the detailed lattice structure in the atomic plane is not of great importance .",
    "thus , the symmetry @xmath116 is exact for every value of @xmath102 only for @xmath4 even , while it is approximate for low @xmath102 for @xmath4 odd .    in view of the experimental data",
    ", it might be instructive to mention that the constant @xmath117 approximately amounts to 1.6 mj / m@xmath1 for ( ga , mn)as .    it is visible that for @xmath118 to 9 , the interplanar couplings are ferromagnetic ( f ) for the whole range of distances ( with an exclusion of wery weak antiferromagnetic ( af ) values for @xmath119 , near the centre of the film ) .",
    "when @xmath4 increases from 5 to 9 , the coupling values are reduced continuously but the shape of the curve remains essentially unmodified .",
    "when @xmath4 is changed from 9 to 10 , a qse is visible ( compare fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "thus , the curve shape changes discontinuously with two minimas , separated by a central maximum .",
    "the coupling values are at the same time shifted towards stronger ferromagnetic values .",
    "then , further increase of @xmath4 causes the gradual lowering of couplings and for @xmath120 the two minima become af in character .",
    "they reach the maximum depth for @xmath121 . switching to @xmath122 ,",
    "the next manifestation of qse is visible as the curve develops an additional central minimum between two maximas .",
    "once more , the coupling values became shifted towards f , and the two af minimas become shallower .",
    "when increasing @xmath4 up to @xmath123 , we notice the same tendency as before , namely the couplings are lowered , the central minimum becomes af in character and the af couplings near the two other minimas tend to rise .",
    "it is instructive to compare the values of interplanar energy obtained by performing the summation in the formula ( [ eq : interlayer2 ] ) for the thin - film rkky coupling integral ( given by ( [ eq : rkky_tf ] ) ) with the some summation for the ordinary 3d rkky coupling ( with the same nonzero width of contact potential).@xcite the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] for @xmath99 , @xmath121 and @xmath105 .",
    "the full circles correspond to the results derived from thin - film rkky coupling , while the empty circles depict the interplanar coupling for 3d rkky integral .",
    "it is visible that for the distances smaller that a half of film thickness , the 3d coupling values are shifted towards f coupling , and also some phase shift is present .",
    "the curve for 3d rkky does not possess the symmetry with respect to the centre of the film so that it vanishes quite fast for @xmath124 , unlike the proper thin - film rkky coupling . in the inset of fig .",

    "the interlayer coupling energy for @xmath75 , calculated on the basis of formulas ( [ eq : interlayer],[eq : interlayer2 ] ) is a key point in our study .",
    "knowing the interplanar coupling energies as a function of concentration of carriers and geometry of the ultrathin film , it is possible to search for the sets of parameters which result in the most robust antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling .",
    "as can be seen from the formula ( [ eq : interlayer2 ] ) , the interlayer energy is calculated by summing the interplanar coupling energies for @xmath125 interplanar distances , ranging from @xmath126 up to @xmath127 , with appropriate weights .",
    "therefore , if the maximum number of @xmath128 values , starting from @xmath129 is antiferromagnetic , the strongest antiferromagnetism can be expected . on the other hand , since the coupling for @xmath129 enters the sum in ( [ eq : interlayer2 ] ) with the largest weight @xmath2 , it is also advisable to select @xmath3 in order to have this af coupling considerably strong .",
    "for example , from the analysis of the fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , prepared for @xmath105 , we can expect to obtain the af interplanar coupling for the first minimum when we select @xmath130 for @xmath121 . for thicker films , @xmath123",

    "this thickness is of importance for two reasons . for one thing , with a diluted system in mind ,",
    "the larger @xmath2 means larger value of total magnetization ; for another , maximizing the critical temperature is also advantageous . on the other hand",
    ", it appears that the increase of the concentration of charge carriers in the system would cause the antiferromagnetic behaviour to diminish .",
    "this is due to the fact that the distance between the subsequent zeros of the function @xmath128 decreases when @xmath102 increases , so that the function oscillates more rapidly and the chance of having af couplings for a few subsequent interplanar distances @xmath13 decreases .",
    "let us note that the last observation seems to stand in apparent contradiction to the general idea that for small concentration of charge carriers ferromagnetism is favoured ( because the first zero of the exchange integral is shifted towards larger distances and more coordination zones belong to this ferromagnetic range ) .",
    "this effect is illustrated in the fig .",

    "it is clearly visible that for the lowest concentration of charge carriers , the antiferromagnetic minima are quite remarkable .",

    "[ fig : fig6 ] illustrates the magnetic layer thickness dependence of the interlayer coupling energy for the already mentioned case of @xmath105 , @xmath121 and @xmath130 .",

    "the circles correspond to the constant carrier concentration of @xmath99 , independent on the thickness of the magnetic layers @xmath2 .",
    "the second result , marked by squares , is for the carrier concentration @xmath139 proportional to the number of magnetically doped atomic planes .",

    "the values have been calculated from the formula ( [ eq : bcr ] ) for the parameters predicting the strongest antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling . in order to provide some reference point , we calculated the value of a normalization constant @xmath143 ( [ eq : b0 ] ) for a representative dms , ( ga , mn)as , which equals @xmath144 t , so that the critical fields would lie in the range of hundreds of milliteslas .",
    "it is visible that the critical field for each case considered is largest for the magnetic layer thickness @xmath2=2 or 3 .",
    "if the lowest value of critical field is needed , together with the highest nel temperature , then the best choice seems to be the maximum thickness of the magnetic layer which still provides af interlayer coupling .    in connection with the predictions of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] , we would like to mention that an attempt to swith the magnetization direction in antiferromagnetically - coupled multilayer of gaas/(ga , mn)as has been made by chung _",
    "et al_.@xcite in their experiment , the field necessary to reverse the magnetization has been estimated at about 10 mt ( judging from the magnetization curve and neutron reflectivity data ) ; however , the full ferromagnetic alignment has not been achieved until 100 mt .",
    "it is worth noticing that in the experiment of chung _",

    "the behaviour of critical temperature of the system for the parameters leading to af interlayer coupling is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8](a ) .",
    "there , we plot the values of the critical temperatures for @xmath105 , @xmath123 and @xmath132 . like in the fig .  [",
    "fig : fig5 ] , the circles correspond to constant charge carriers density @xmath99 , while the squares are for @xmath139 .",
    "the empty symbols indicate the nel temperatures ( what corresponds to af interlayer coupling ) , while the full symbols are for curie temperature ( f coupling ) .",
    "it is visible that for fixed @xmath102 , the critical temperature tends to saturate when increasing @xmath2 and reaches approximately constant value for the magnetic layer consisting of several ml .",
    "it is seen that the nel temperature for @xmath140 is very close to that saturated value . for @xmath139 ,",
    "the critical temperatures are mostly curie temperatures and rise relatively fast when the magnetic layer thickness increases .    in order to investigate more carefully the critical temperatures for the regime of fixed charge carriers concentration @xmath99 , we perform the calculations for some other sets of parameters advantageous to af coupling .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8](b ) .",
    "the same tendency for the critical temperature to saturate for thick magnetic layers is observed , and the maximum values of nel temperature lie close to that limit of saturation .",
    "let us mention that a similar behaviour of curie temperature for thin films with rkky interaction has been found in the monte - carlo based studies of boselli _",
    "et al._,@xcite for fixed charge carriers concentration .",
    "however , they considered a thin film with magnetic impurities distributed randomly in all the atomic planes and their study was focused mainly on non - collinear magnetic phases , resembling canted ferromagnetism .",
    "[ fig : fig8](c ) compares of the critical temperature calculated from the `` exact '' mfa formula ( [ eq : tc ] ) and from the approximate formula ( [ eq : tcapproximate ] ) , as dependent on magnetic layer thickness , for the set of parameters @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "it can be concluded that the assumption of uniform magnetization distribution inside each magnetic layer does not lead to a noticeable change in the critical temperature for the layers up to 4 ml thick .",
    "however , for thicker layers , the critical temperature is underestimated by an approximate formula in the order of 5 % , which conclusion holds also for other sets of parameters .",
    "it follows from the numerical calculations that the intralayer energy is much larger than the absolute value of the interlayer coupling . as a consequence ,",
    "it is clearly visible from eq.([eq : tcapproximate ] ) that the main contribution to the critical temperature originates from @xmath150 .",
    "as mentioned previously , in the ordered state , each atomic plane of the magnetic layer has its own magnetization value and some non - uniform magnetization distribution exists across the layer thickness . to illustrate this behaviour , we calculated such magnetization profiles for various thicknesses of the magnetic layers @xmath2 for the cases of @xmath105 , @xmath123 and @xmath132 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9](a ) ) as well as for @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9](b ) ) .",
    "the plots present a magnetization distribution in a single magnetic layer .",
    "each profile is calculated for the temperature of @xmath151 for the given value of @xmath2 , versus the number of the atomic plane counted starting from the plane situated closest to the undoped spacer .",
    "for the second magnetic layer , the values of @xmath152 are either the same ( for f interlayer coupling ) or they are of opposite sign ( for af coupling ) , so that the profile is either symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to the centre of the undoped spacer .",
    "it is noticeable that for small thicknesses , @xmath153 , the distribution is almost uniform , while the increasing thickness of the magnetic layer causes the profile to reshape .",
    "the maximum of magnetization occurs for the atomic plane in the middle of the magnetic layer , while the smallest values are reached for the planes which are the most distant or the closest to the nonmagnetic spacer . for @xmath154 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9](a ) or @xmath155 fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9](b ) , the distribution is approximately symmetric with respect to the middle atomic plane in the layer .",
    "it is noticeable that the differences in magnetizations for various atomic planes are strongly evident , since the magnetization at the boundaries of the magnetic layer is only a half of the maximum value reached in its centre .",
    "interestingly , the profile losts its symmetry when we reach the maximum of possible magnetic layer thickness , @xmath156 for ( a ) and @xmath157 for ( b ) .",
    "then the magnetization value in the atomic planes in the vicinity of the spacer is enhanced in comparison with the layers at the opposite side of the magnetic layer .",
    "such an effect is more striking for the set of parameters @xmath105 , @xmath123 , @xmath132 , where the distribution of magnetization switches from almost symmetric shape with respect to the middle plane of the layer ( for @xmath154 ) to almost flat one with some drop at high distances from the spacer ( for @xmath156 ) . by approaching the critical temperature",
    "the profiles flatten and their magnitude is vanishing .",
    "the analysis of a model magnetic bilayer with ultrathin film - modified rkky interaction revealed an importance of qse for obtaining antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling .",
    "some ranges of parameters , advantageous for af were identified , with a general remark that the carrier density should not be so high to make the oscillation period excessively short .",
    "the coupling is possible even for relatively thick spacers ( 14 ml for example ) ; however , the maximum thickness of each magnetic layer should not exceed a few ml .",
    "the critical temperatures were found to saturate when increasing magnetic layer thickness .",
    "the general conclusion which can be drawn from the study is that the occurrence of af coupling presents a quite unique situation in comparison with the most common f ordering .",
    "thus , in order to observe the af configuration the special set of parameters has to be chosen including the impurity concentration , its distribution within the thin film , the thickness and the carriers density .",
    "studies of sensitivity of the obtained configuration to the external magnetic field might be useful for practical realization of the switching function between the af and f states .",
    "on the other hand , taking into consideration the importance of selecting the spacer thickness , some analysis embracing the interface roughness might also be interesting .",
    "although the magnetization profiles in thin films were already studied for nn interactions a long time ago@xcite , as far as we know for the long - range rkky interactions the above presented profiles are found for the first time .",
    "prediction of the profiles would need some experimental confirmation in the future studies of dms systems .",
    "let us observe that the presence of non - uniform magnetization profile causes a noticeable decrease in the total magnetization of each magnetic layer at finite temperatures ( with respect to the prediction of the usual , bulk brillouin function ) .    in an ultrathin film , the characteristic features of rkky exchange integral",
    "depend crucially on the standing - wave form of the free - carrier wavefunctions .",
    "they originate from the interference of waves propagating perpendicularly to the thin film plane .",
    "thus , long enough phase coherence length for free charge carriers is required for this picture to be valid .",
    "taking ( ga , mn)as as an example , the coherence lengths of the order of 100 nm have been reported in quantum wires and rings for millikelvin temperatures ( in presence of magnetic impurities),@xcite even though a mean free path for the carriers is shorter , down to an order of a lattice constant in the metallic - like regime .",
    "@xcite such a value of phase coherence length exceeds the thicknesses of the films presented in this paper .    in the present work it has been assumed that the ( random ) positions of the magnetic impurity ions are uncorrelated .",
    "however , it could be also possible to investigate the influence of correlated positional disorder on the magnetic properties of the thin - film systems by considering the non - zero warren - cowley parameter ."
