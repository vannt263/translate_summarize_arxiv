    "the discovery of superconductivity in the simple binary compound , mgb@xmath3 , generated an intense research activity  mainly , because mgb@xmath3 exhibits a transition temperature @xmath7 of @xmath0k , which is almost two times higher than that of any other intermetallic superconductor known earlier  @xcite , but also because of good perspectives for practical applications . during the two years , which have passed from this discovery ,",
    "our understanding of physical properties of the novel superconductor has made rapid progress .",
    "after confirmation  @xcite of the spin - singlet type of the cooper pairs involved , the main discussions relating to fundamental physics concentrated on two issues : the mechanism of the cooper pair formation and the symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "the boron isotope effect experiments  @xcite were the first indication of phonon - mediated superconductivity .",
    "direct experimental probes of phonon - induced structures in point - contact  @xcite and tunneling  @xcite superconducting junctions have provided unequivocal support to the theories  @xcite , which explain the relatively high @xmath7 as originating from the strong anharmonic electron - phonon coupling to raman - active high - frequency @xmath8 vibration modes , corresponding to the in - plane distortions of the boron hexagons .",
    "it took much longer to elucidate the properties of the superconducting order parameter , but now from the results of tunneling and photoemission spectroscopy , specific heat , and other measurements emerged strong experimental evidence that magnesium diboride belongs to a rare class of materials with two gaps of different widths , which arise from a huge anisotropy of electronic properties ( _ cf _ the review of tunneling data for magnesium diboride  @xcite ) .",
    "the fermi surface of mgb@xmath3 is very anisotropic and consists of four bands : two @xmath9-type quasi - two - dimensional cylindrical hole sheets and two @xmath10-type three - dimensional tubular networks , exhibiting very different electron - phonon coupling strengths  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the superconducting gap varies considerably on the fermi surface and , as follows from first - principles calculations  @xcite , clusters into two groups .",
    "the @xmath9 cylindrical sheets relate to a larger gap of an average value of @xmath11mev with small variations , while the smaller gap ranges from @xmath12 to @xmath13mev on the three - dimensional @xmath5 sheets .",
    "these calculations support a two - gap scenario for magnesium diboride , originally proposed by shulga _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in order to explain the behavior of the upper critical magnetic field .",
    "it should be noted that , in contrast to conventional superconductors , impurity scattering does not average out strongly different gap values .",
    "averaging becomes ineffective in mgb@xmath3 because the different symmetry of @xmath9- and @xmath10-type bands makes interband scattering much weaker than intraband impurity mixing of electron states  @xcite .",
    "based on such ideas , an effective two - band model with @xmath14mev and @xmath15mev was derived , and consequences for tunneling into mgb@xmath3 were deduced  @xcite .",
    "the discussion of our tunneling and point contact data relating to the energy gap distribution will be mainly based on this model and will use a minimal number of fitting parameters .",
    "most samples studied previously were in the intermediate regime between a direct metallic contact and a tunnel junction with a strong insulating ( i ) barrier .",
    "the main conclusions for these structures have been drawn by fitting the differential conductance data to the one - dimensional blonder - tinkham - klapwijk ( btk ) model  @xcite , modified by introducing a damping parameter @xmath16 , and by taking into account two possible channels for the charge transport , so that not only the gap values , but also the ratio of the individual channel contributions were taken as adjustable parameters . in this paper , we present the data for low - resistance junctions with a gold counter - electrode , which to our knowledge are the first reported direct metallic - type contacts with superconducting mgb@xmath3 , and which can be described within the two - band model  @xcite without any additional parameters .",
    "moreover , by applying dc current pulses we have successfully transformed the clean contact into a high - resistance tunneling junction , and reproduced in this way the two limiting regimes of the theory  @xcite .",
    "the second issue , which is discussed in the paper , is the assertion by schmidt _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite that pressing a counter - electrode into the mgb@xmath3 sample often breaks off an mgb@xmath3 crystal fragment and results ( even if we are dealing with a normal ( n ) injector ) in a junction between two ( identical ) superconductors , instead of the expected normal metal  -  superconductor structure .",
    "such internal break - junctions apparently can be formed also when a superconducting counter - electrode is pressed into mgb@xmath3 .",
    "our experiments with a lead injector provide an independent confirmation of the observation made by schmidt _",
    "et al . _ , and fit into the double - gap scenario as well .",
    "we used polycrystalline mgb@xmath3 samples in the form of @xmath17 rectangular bars of high density , prepared by compacting commercial magnesium diboride powder at @xmath18kbar .",
    "magnetization measurements have shown a superconducting transition with the onset and midpoint at @xmath19 and @xmath20k , respectively .",
    "all experiments were performed at @xmath21k .",
    "the junctions based on these samples exhibited mostly no native barrier , and their resistance varied from several to a few tens of ohms . in order to establish a suitable barrier between the electrodes , we applied short current pulses with an amplitude of several tens of milliamperes and a duration of a few seconds ; as a result we obtained junction resistances up to a few hundred ohms .",
    "two different counter - electrodes have been used : lead and gold .",
    "current @xmath22 versus voltage @xmath23 characteristics as well as differential conductance spectra @xmath24 were measured by conventional four - probe lock - in technique  @xcite . in the paper",
    "we present typical data obtained in this manner .",
    "the junctions with pb injector were fabricated by mounting a pb hemisphere of @xmath25 mm diameter on an elastic beryllium strip , which was driven into the mgb@xmath3 surface .",
    "point - contact junctions with an au counter - electrode were prepared by touching the superconducting surface with a @xmath26  mm gold wire wrapped around the mgb@xmath3 sample ; the formation of sns junctions was avoided in this manner .",
    "the device was stabilized by a coat of varnish .",
    "this procedure , which yielded junction resistance of about @xmath27 and conductance spectra indicating a direct heterostructure formed by normal and superconducting electrodes , could in principle produce several point contacts instead of a single one .",
    "such occurrence is not important in the case of clean junctions , since in such a case the spectral contribution of the contacts with transparency significantly smaller than unity is negligible . in our best au - mgb@xmath3 samples ,",
    "an almost ideal metallic sharvin contact between gold and magnesium diboride was formed .",
    "this can be seen from the conductance drop with voltage increase from @xmath28 to @xmath29 ( figure  [ f.1_au ] ) .",
    "the drop is almost by a factor of two , with the small deviation attributed to damping and thermal smearing effects .",
    "the junctions with a pb injector were prepared in an analogous manner to that used by schmidt _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who formed symmetric @xmath30 structures by breaking off an mgb@xmath3 crystal fragment under the tip pressure . following the arguments of the cited work",
    ", we also suppose that our pb - mgb@xmath3 samples are symmetric break junctions inside the magnesium diboride bulk , rather than contacts between two different superconductors .",
    "the nature of the junction barrier is unknown , but its small resistance compared to that of the sis structures  @xcite suggests that we are dealing rather with sns contacts ( see also the paper of gonnelli _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and arguments given below ) .",
    "the initial @xmath31 characteristic exhibited a critical supercurrent at zero bias @xmath32ma and normal - state resistance @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath34mv [ plot @xmath35 in the inset in figure  [ f.1_pb](a ) ] .",
    "this value of @xmath36 is significantly lower than that predicted by the model  @xcite for a josephson current across a symmetric @xmath30 device , but is consistent with @xmath36 values found previously by two other groups  @xcite for break junctions of magnesium diboride .",
    "the evolution of the interface properties of the junctions , caused by the application of the forming current pulses , is clearly visible in the current - voltage characteristics shown by the inset in figure  [ f.1_pb](a ) .",
    "after two successive current pulses ( characteristics ` 2 ' and ` 3 ' in the inset ) , we obtained a finite resistance @xmath37 at zero bias ( characteristic ` 3 ' ) .",
    "the latter characteristic , shown in the main panel of figure  [ f.1_pb](a ) in a larger voltage scale , exhibits an excess current @xmath38 known to be the manifestation of andreev reflections in high - transparency superconducting heterostructures .",
    "remarkably , only twofold increase of junction resistance was sufficient to suppress the supercurrent , whereas the josephson current in reference  @xcite was visible up to contact resistances of about @xmath39 . our result can indicate that we create multiple incoherent - scattering centers and the josephson current is cancelled because of the phase - breaking events .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite found that magnesium diboride samples prepared by solid - state reaction contain large amounts of precipitates composed mainly of magnesium and oxygen .",
    "we believe that their presence is the origin of a strong damping factor in conductance spectra of mgb@xmath3 ( even without any current treatment ) , stressed in almost all publications on point - contact spectroscopy of this compound .",
    "it is highly probable that by applying current pulses , we create such centers and destroy the phase coherence during the charge transfer across the interface region between two superconducting banks .    to further verify the hypothesis of the sns symmetric break - junctions formed inside mgb@xmath3 bulk ,",
    "let us analyze the high - voltage asymptote of the current - voltage characteristic shown in figure  [ f.1_pb](a ) and known to be determined by a set of interlayer transparencies  @xcite .",
    "their distribution has been found in two extreme cases : for a diffusive normal conductor by dorokhov  @xcite and for a disordered insulating interface by schep and bauer  @xcite ( see also naveh _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ) . for two identical superconductors",
    "both theories predict @xmath40 , where the last term is the excess current @xmath38 . for the dorokhov distribution , the coefficient @xmath41 , while within the schep - bauer approximation , @xmath42 @xcite . applying the arguments of reference @xcite",
    ", we presume that for dissimilar superconductors with gap values @xmath43 and @xmath44 the excess current in a sns@xmath45 junction is given by @xmath46 .",
    "we can perform then an analysis similar to that presented in reference  @xcite for the dc josephson current .",
    "for a symmetric @xmath30 structure we conclude that the @xmath47 product should vary from @xmath48mv ( tunneling along the @xmath49-axis direction ) to @xmath50mv ( tunneling within the @xmath51 plane ) in the case of a s - diffusive n - s structure , and between @xmath52mv to @xmath53mv in the case of a disordered insulating interface . at the same time , for a contact formed by a conventional superconductor like pb with a single gap equal to @xmath54mv , the @xmath47 value can not exceed @xmath55mv in any model . from figure  [ f.1_pb](a )",
    "we find @xmath56mv , i.e. a value much greater than the latter limit .",
    "this strongly supports the thesis that the weak link in our structures with lead counter - electrode is not at the interface of the contacting materials but rather inside the magnesium diboride bulk .",
    "furthermore , the product @xmath47 exceeds the upper limit for the schep - bauer distribution , providing an argument for the sns nature of the junction .    to verify further this scenario ,",
    "let us compare our dc differential conductance with the predictions of the scattering - matrix theory of multiple andreev reflections in short disordered sns junctions  @xcite .",
    "using zero voltage asymptotic behavior of the dc differential conductance @xmath24 ( equation ( 14 ) of reference @xcite ) , we can check on the background behavior of our conductance spectra .",
    "we apply an interpolating formula @xmath57 , which is valid both at very low bias ( the near - zero - bias @xmath58 singularity is the hallmark of andreev - reflection processes occurring at each junction face ) , and at very high voltages ( in the latter case @xmath59 is equal to the normal - state value @xmath60 ) . using @xmath61 as a fitting parameter",
    ", we found that the best agreement with the experimental data is achieved for @xmath62mev .",
    "the overall behavior of the experimental normalized conductance @xmath63 corresponding to the experimental data and plotted in function of @xmath64 is satisfactorily described [ see the inset in figure  [ f.1_pb](a ) ] by a simple fitting line @xmath65 in the voltage range above @xmath25mv , where temperature smearing is not effective . in the small bias region up to @xmath66mev , the conductance exhibits a fine structure , which according to bardas and averin  @xcite can be attributed to subharmonic gap singularities , as well as to the gap features .",
    "characteristic ` 3 ' is more smooth than ` 2 ' , and the corresponding differential conductance presented in the main panel of figure  [ f.1_pb](b ) contains a strongly suppressed zero - bias peak and two maxima .",
    "their voltage positions are very close to the combinations of small and large gap values @xmath67 and @xmath68 expected for the magnesium diboride  @xcite and shown in figure  [ f.1_pb](b ) by arrows .",
    "we should emphasize that we do not observe any signs of the lead gap .",
    "moreover , the features discussed above , including the peak at @xmath28 , are seen at temperatures exceeding the @xmath69 of pb , and this rules out their possible relation to the lead counter - electrode .",
    "let us examine now the conductance spectra of our au - mgb@xmath3 point contacts in the framework of a double - gap model with fixed gap values and weighing factors  @xcite .",
    "these quantities are found from first - principles calculations , therefore the adjustable parameters are reduced to the barrier strength and the damping factor @xmath70 .",
    "the latter one was introduced into the tunneling density of states by dynes _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and is often referred to as the dynes factor .",
    "the barrier strength is measured by a parameter @xmath71  @xcite , where @xmath72 is the barrier height , @xmath73 denotes the coordinate normal to the interface , @xmath74 is the barrier width , and @xmath75 is the @xmath73-component of the fermi velocity .",
    "the conductance spectrum @xmath59 is assumed to be a sum of two single - mode btk contributions  @xcite related to the two @xmath9- and @xmath10-type bands in proportions strongly depending on the injection angle .",
    "the relevant weighting factors , which determine the ratio of the two contributions , are proportional to the squared plasma frequencies and are given in reference  @xcite for the transport within the @xmath51 plane , @xmath76 , and for tunneling in the @xmath49-axis direction , @xmath77 .",
    "in the present experiment , the conductance is a mixture of @xmath51 plane and @xmath49-axis contributions with unknown coefficients , which can be different for different polycrystalline samples .",
    "only to get a qualitative estimate of the averaged conductance spectra predicted by the theory , we compare the measured spectra with the mean characteristic @xmath78/2 $ ] . as it was stated above , we prefer to obtain qualitative conclusions with a limited number of fitting parameters rather than to introduce weighting factors with the aim to improve the agreement between theory and experiment .    in reference  @xcite , a two - step structure",
    "was predicted for a direct contact between a normal - metal injector and magnesium diboride and for charge transport in the @xmath51 plane ( upper curve in the inset in figure  [ f.1_au ] calculated for @xmath79 ) . for the @xmath49-axis transport",
    ", the main contribution comes from the @xmath10 band ( curve @xmath80 in the inset ) .",
    "the averaged characteristic ( see curve @xmath81 in the inset and the dashed curve in the main panel ) , which takes into account a small dynes factor @xmath16 and temperature smearing effects determined by a standard procedure involving fermi distribution functions , qualitatively well reproduces the two - step feature observed by us experimentally ( solid line in figure  [ f.1_au ] ) .",
    "it should be stressed that this good agreement of experiment and theory was obtained with a single fitting parameter @xmath16 .",
    "we formed next a low - transparency insulating ( i ) barrier in our au - i - mgb@xmath3 junctions by applying additional current pulses and measured the resultant @xmath59 characteristics in a wide range of bias voltages ( up to @xmath82mev ) .",
    "the conductance background usually exhibited a roughly parabolic dependence on voltage , with a very small offset of minimum from @xmath83 ( see figure  [ f.2 ] ) , indicating an almost symmetrical barrier  @xcite and proving the tunneling character of the charge transport .",
    "a simple formula  @xcite for a rectangular potential barrier may be used to find an average barrier height @xmath84 and its thickness @xmath74 . in order to carry out the evaluation",
    ", we need the contact area , which is unknown .",
    "nevertheless , a minimal value for @xmath85 parameter can be estimated from the parabolic shape of the conductance curve . according to reference  @xcite ,",
    "the coefficient @xmath86 in the quadratic term in the voltage dependence of conductance , @xmath87 , is given by @xmath88 , where @xmath84 is in volts and @xmath74 is in ngstroms .",
    "we assume @xmath74 to be not less than two - three lattice parameters and take as a minimum @xmath89 .",
    "substituting @xmath86 found from the measured conductance background ( figure  [ f.2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath90 .",
    "consequently , we take the first fitting parameter @xmath85 equal to @xmath91 .    in figure",
    "[ f.3 ] , the main panel presents the measured conductance spectrum of the same junction in the near - gap voltage region , while in the inset we show the conductance calculated for tunneling into the @xmath51 plane and along the @xmath49-axis direction for vanishing dynes factor , @xmath92 .",
    "the latter characteristics clearly indicate that the most pronounced feature in the average conductance spectrum should be the smaller gap peak , whose signature is missing from the measured spectrum .",
    "the most probable cause is the strong disorder induced by the forming current pulses and the resulting significant inelastic scattering near the interface . for large values of @xmath16 ( the second fitting parameter ) the agreement between the experimental and calculated conductances",
    "is very good , as shown in the main panel in figure  [ f.3 ] .    to conclude the discussion of near - gap features in the junction characteristics ,",
    "let us make two remarks concerning the role of disordering effects .",
    "the analysis based on a simple btk approach  @xcite for describing the experiment with ( probably ) numerous elastic and inelastic scatterers randomly distributed within the barrier appears to be somewhat naive , nevertheless is justified , since one can always introduce an effective transparency parameter @xmath85 within a single - mode model  @xcite by integrating over a certain distribution of transparencies ( see the corresponding discussion in reference  @xcite ) .",
    "it should be stressed that the additional averaging already takes into account the possible appearance of multiple point contacts in our experiments .",
    "the averaging provides some additional smearing , but the most transparent contacts will dominate in the spectrum .",
    "the second remark concerns the possibility of observing double - gap spectrum in a disordered superconductor with important charge scattering .",
    "our samples contain comparatively large grains .",
    "therefore , we expect that the measured characteristics of a clean point contact reflect the bulk properties of the material .",
    "it is known that dense bulk samples of mgb@xmath3 are usually in the clean limit , with the elastic mean free path large in comparison to the superconducting coherence length .",
    "this condition is necessary to observe two distinct gaps in a sufficiently clean superconductor . at the same time , our method of fabricating the insulating layer between the electrodes generates , as it was argued above , a great amount of inelastic - scattering inclusions . at first sight",
    ", the interband impurity scattering should cause the gaps to converge .",
    "but this is not the case for magnesium diboride . according to reference  @xcite",
    ", optical properties of dense polycrystalline samples of mgb@xmath3 , as well as a surprisingly small correlation between the defect concentration and @xmath69 , can be understood only by assuming negligibly small inter - band impurity scattering .",
    "the possible reason is in the specific electronic structure of mgb@xmath3 , namely the the two - dimensional @xmath4-band states overlap slightly with the states in the mg plane , where defects are most likely to occur  @xcite .",
    "thus one can expect that the interband scattering rate between the @xmath4- and @xmath5-bands is small , even in low - quality samples .",
    "in summary , we have realized several different types of heterostructures based on superconducting magnesium diboride : from a low - resistance ( almost ideal ) au - mgb@xmath3 point contact to an sns junction ( with a lead counter - electrode ) obtained by applying current pulses .",
    "moreover , with this technique we have succeeded to transform point - contact samples with gold injector into tunnel - like devices . in the case of lead electrode ,",
    "we have confirmed the observation of schmidt _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite that pressing the electrode can result in the formation of symmetric superconductor - superconductor junctions inside the magnesium diboride bulk .",
    "our findings for au and pb counter - electrodes were interpreted within the two - gap model for the energy spectrum of mgb@xmath3 and thus provide novel arguments in favor of a multi - band scenario for magnesium diboride .",
