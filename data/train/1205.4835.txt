    "it is believed that the evolution of the large - scale magnetic field of the sun is governed by the interplay between large - scale motions , like differential rotation and meridional circulation , turbulent convection flows and magnetic fields .",
    "one of the most important issues in solar dynamo theory is related to the origin of the equatorial drift of sunspot activity in the equatorial regions and , simultaneously at high latitudes , the poleward drift of the location of large - scale unipolar regions and quiet prominences . @xcite and @xcite suggested that the evolution of large - scale magnetic activity of the sun can be interpreted as dynamo waves propagating perpendicular to the direction of shear from the differential rotation .",
    "they found that the propagation can be considered as a diffusion process , which follows the iso - rotation surfaces of angular velocity in the solar convection zone .",
    "the direction of propagation can be modified by meridional circulation , anisotropic diffusion and the effects of turbulent pumping ( see , e.g. , ) .",
    "the latter induces an effective drift of the large - scale magnetic field even though the mean flow of the turbulent medium may be zero .",
    "the turbulent pumping effects can be equally important both for dynamos without meridional circulation and for the meridional circulation - dominated dynamo regimes .",
    "for the latter case the velocity of turbulent pumping has to be comparable to the meridional circulation speed .",
    "it is known that an effect of this magnitude can be produced by diamagnetic pumping and perhaps by so - called topological pumping .",
    "both effects produce pumping in the radial direction and have not a direct impact on the latitudinal drift of the large - scale magnetic field .",
    "recently @xcite , it has been found that the helical convective motions and the helical turbulent magnetic fields interacting with large - scale magnetic fields and differential rotation can produce effective pumping in the direction of the large - scale vorticity vector .",
    "thus , the effect produces a latitudinal transport of the large - scale magnetic field in the convective zone wherever the angular velocity has a strong radial gradient .",
    "it is believed that these regions , namely the tachocline beneath the solar convection zone and the subsurface shear layer , are important for the solar dynamo .",
    "figure [ fig : the - field - line ] illustrates the principal processes that induce the helicity  vorticity pumping effect .",
    "it is suggested that this effect produces an anisotropic drift of the large - scale magnetic field , which means that the different components of the large - scale magnetic field drift in different directions",
    ". earlier work , e.g.  by @xcite and @xcite , suggests that the effect of anisotropy in the transport of mean - field is related to nonlinear effects of the global coriolis force on the convection .",
    "also , nonlinear effects of the large - scale magnetic field result in an anisotropy of turbulent pumping .",

    "the induced electromotive force has a component , @xmath4 , which is perpendicular to the field @xmath1 .",

    "the analytical calculations show that the leading effect of pumping is described by a large - scale magnetic drift in the direction of the large - scale vorticity vector and by anisotropic pumping which produces a drift of toroidal and poloidal components of the field in opposite directions .",
    "the component of the drift that is induced by global rotation and helicity ( second line in eq .",
    "( [ eq : emfp ] ) ) is rather small compared to the main effect .",
    "the latter conclusion should be checked separately for a different model of background turbulence , taking into account the generation of kinetic helicity due to global rotation and stratification in a turbulent medium .",
    "we have estimated the pumping effect for the solar convection zone and compared it with other turbulent pumping effects including diamagnetic pumping and turbulent pumping that results from magnetic fluctuations in stratified turbulence @xcite .",
    "the latter is sometimes referred to as `` density - gradient pumping effect '' @xcite .",
    "the diamagnetic pumping is upward in the upper part of the convection zone and downward near the bottom .",
    "the velocity field of density - gradient pumping is more complicated ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "however , its major effect is concentrated near the surface .",
    "both diamagnetic pumping and density - gradient pumping effects are quenched inversely proportional to the coriolis number @xcite .",
    "the helicity  vorticity pumping effect modifies the direction of large - scale magnetic drift at the bottom of the convection zone .",
    "this effect was illustrated by a dynamo model that shows a dominant poleward branch of the dynamo wave at the bottom of the convection zone .",
    "it is found that the magnetic helicity contribution of the pumping effect can be important for explaining the fine structure of the sunspot butterfly diagram . in particular , the magnetic helicity contribution results in a slow - down of equatorial propagation of the dynamo wave . the slow - down starts just before the maximum of the cycle .",
    "observations indicate a similar behavior in sunspot activity @xcite .",
    "a behavior like this can be seen in flux - transport models as well ( @xcite ) . for the time being it is unclear what are the differences between different dynamo models and how well do they reproduce the observations .",
