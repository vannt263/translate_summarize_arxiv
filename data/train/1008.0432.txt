    "our @xmath39 is slightly longer than those in other studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "a , the observed sed can be described with a blackbody emission as shown in figure  3 .",
    "we derived the best - fit temperature at @xmath63 .",
    "the sed , hence , indicates that the optical  nir flux was dominated by an optically thick pseudophotosphere at the rebrightening maximum .    in ordinary novae",
    ", the blackbody - like photospheric emission dominates the optical flux only around the maximum light . in the case of v2362  cyg",
    ", @xcite reported the optical spectrum during the earliest phase , and suggested that its blue spectrum resembled that of an a5a7 supergiant .",
    "this indicates that the optical emission was dominated by a pseudophotosphere with @xmath64@xmath65 at the outburst maximum @xcite .",
    "the photospheric temperature at the rebrightening maximum was , therefore , comparable to or slightly higher than , that at the first maximum , while the rebrightening maximum was fainter .",
    "assuming blackbody emission , we can readily compare the sizes of the emitting region at the initial and rebrightening maxima using the apparent @xmath20-magnitude and the temperatures . as a result",
    ", the diameter of the photosphere at the rebrightening maximum is estimated to be about half of that at the first maximum .",
    "after the rebrightening maximum , the object started a gradual fading in all optical  nir bands .",
    "the @xmath66 color just before and after the rebrightening maximum is shown in figure  [ color ] .",
    "there was no significant change across the rebrightening maximum , i.e. , in @xmath67228245 .",
    "this suggests that the shape of the sed remained almost constant irrespective of the flux variation across the rebrightening maximum ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "( 80mm,50mm)fig3.eps    ( 80mm,60mm)fig4.eps    sudden brightenings in @xmath24- and @xmath25-bands were then detected on @xmath69 ( epoch c ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ sed ] , the pseudophotosphere component rapidly decreased , while another nir component increased around the epoch .",
    "the brightening was observed in @xmath23- and @xmath70-bands a few days later . in figure 3 , we plot @xmath71- , @xmath72- , and @xmath73-band data on @xmath74 ( epoch d ) reported by @xcite and also give blackbody spectra with temperatures of 1500 and 1000  k. the 1500  k blackbody spectrum well explains the observed ir sed on @xmath74 .",
    "hence , this ir emission can be interpreted as the thermal emission from dust grains . @xcite and",
    "@xcite reported the dust temperature of @xmath75 on @xmath74 and @xmath76 on @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "the dust shell would be formed , presumably associated with the rebrightening event .",
    "the rapid decrease of the pseudophotosphere component is likely to be connected with the increasing absorption by the dust shell .",
    "after the @xmath25-band maximum on @xmath78 ( epoch e ) , the object faded in all optical  nir bands . at @xmath79 ( epoch f ) ,",
    "as shown in figure  [ sed ] , the nir emission can be described with the 1000  k blackbody spectrum .",
    "@xcite reported the dust temperature was below @xmath80  k on @xmath81 .",
    "the dust cooling , thus , seems to have started just after the @xmath25-band maximum , probably due to cessation of the dust formation and expansion of the dust shell .",
    "assuming an optically thin dust cloud and a distance to v2362  cyg of @xmath82  kpc , @xcite estimated the mass of carbonaceous dust grains of @xmath83m@xmath6 .",
    "however , they underestimated the dust mass because they used the nir flux at pre - maximum phase ( epoch d ; 7 days before the @xmath25 maximum ) when the bolometric luminosity of the dust cloud ( @xmath84 ) was still 0.4 times as large as the maximum value on epoch e. the uncertainty of the distance should also be considered for the error estimation of the dust mass .",
    "then , we estimate the dust mass of v2362  cyg with our data under the same assumption as @xcite that carbon dusts were formed after the rebrightening .",
    "although the late time observation ( @xmath85 ) suggests that the ir spectrum was not typical for carbonaceous dust emission @xcite , the dominant species could be changed with epochs ( e.g. , qv  vul , @xcite ; v705  cas , @xcite )    according to @xcite , the mass of the dust cloud ( @xmath86 ) is derived as @xmath87   \\left ( \\frac{t_{\\rm dust}}{1000\\mbox { k } } \\right)^{-6 } \\mbox{m}_{\\solar},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 is the distance to the nova , n is a number of total dust grains and @xmath89 is a temperature of dust grains .",
    "we assume graphite dust grains of a density of @xmath90 and a planck - mean cross section coefficient @xmath91 ( for smaller grains with size of @xmath92 @xmath93 ; @xcite ) . adopting @xmath94",
    "k estimated from the ir data in @xmath74 ( epoch  d ) and @xmath95  w@xmath96 in our data at nir maximum ( @xmath78 , epoch e ) , we obtain @xmath97 we note that the deriving mass does not mean the whole mass formed in the ejecta after the rebrightening event , but the mass evaluated at the nir maximum ( @xmath78 , epoch  e ) .",
    "@xmath86 highly depends on the distance @xmath88 , although it has not been determined well ; @xmath98  kpc @xcite , @xmath56@xmath99  kpc @xcite , @xmath100@xmath101  kpc @xcite , @xmath102  kpc @xcite and @xmath103@xmath104  kpc @xcite . for the nearest ( @xmath98 kpc ) and",
    "the most distant ( @xmath105  kpc ) cases , the @xmath86 becomes @xmath106 m@xmath8 and @xmath107 m@xmath8 , respectively . even if we take the uppermost value , @xmath86 is comparable to or smaller than those of ordinary dust - forming novae ( @xmath108@xmath109  m@xmath6 ; e.g. @xcite ) .    it is noted that the dust mass should be larger if the dust cloud is optically thick as indicated by @xcite . if this is the case , the derived @xmath86 should be the lower - limit and the actual dust mass would be larger .",
    "on the other hand , our nir data suggests that @xmath84 is only @xmath110@xmath111 times as large as the bolometric luminosity of nova ( @xmath112 ) even at the @xmath25 maximum , if we assume @xmath113 erg s@xmath114 with @xmath82  kpc as @xcite .",
    "@xmath84 is calculated by integrations of blackbody seds fitted with @xmath25-band data assuming dust temperatures with a rage of @xmath115@xmath116  k and @xmath88=7.2  kpc .",
    "these facts suggest that the dust cloud does not fully cover the nova ( i.e. , covers by less than 4@xmath117 str ) , if the dust cloud was optically thick .",
    "a patchy cloud is preferable .",
    "@xcite and @xcite detected p - cygni profiles in the optical spectrum of v2362  cyg during its rising phase to the rebrightening maximum ( @xmath118 ) . in conjunction with the existence of the blackbody emission of @xmath119",
    "k , the rebrightening phase is reminiscent of the maximum phase of ordinary novae ( @xcite ) .",
    "we propose that the rebrightening event was caused by the reformed pseudophotosphere by a delayed mass - outflow .",
    "@xcite recently proposed that the energy source of the rebrightening is magnetic reconnections around the pseudophotosphere formed by the first outflow . such a magnetic activity may have accelerated the gas and caused the second outflow in v2362  cyg .    as discussed in section  4.1 ,",
    "the mass of the dust grains formed after the rebrightening is likely to be smaller than those in other dust - forming novae .",
    "if the dust grains are formed in the first ejecta cooled predominantly by expansion ( i.e. , classical dust formation mechanism , e.g. , @xcite ) the epoch of the dust formation is expected to be earlier ( @xmath120 d ) and the dust mass should be larger , as in ordinary dust - forming novae .",
    "the ejecta of the second outflow would contain less materials than that of the initial outflow because the peak luminosity of the rebrightening was much lower than the initial peak .",
    "thus , masses are considered to be small for both the dust and the ejecta in the second outflow .",
    "this suggests that the dust grains would be formed preferentially from the material of the second outflow , if the @xcite s scenario that the dust formation would be triggered by the interaction between the second outflow and the initial flow is the case .      here",
    "we briefly discuss the nature of the termination of the rebrightening , i.e. , the beginning of the decline on @xmath121 .",
    "we can consider two scenarios ; ( i ) the rebrightening was terminated due to the increasing absorption for the optical  nir flux by the dust grains , and ( ii ) the rebrightening was terminated by a decay of the emission from the pseudophotosphere itself .",
    "if the former scenario is ture , we could expect the reddening of the object just after the rebrightening maximum . as shown in figure  [ color",
    "] , however , no reddening was detected for the first 4  d just after the rebrightening maximum .",
    "the observation , hence , favors the latter scenario .",
    "if scenario ( ii ) is the case , the dust grains are likely to begin to be formed about a week after the rebrightening maximum .",
    "this implies that the dust formation might be promoted by the decay of the emission from the shrinking pseudophotosphere . the optical steep decline with the nir brightening after @xmath122 suggests that the increasing absorption due to dust formation is significant .",
    "however , the shrinking pseudophotosphere might also have partly caused the decline of the optical flux ( and a part of nir one ) . a full analysis with a radiation transfer for the pseudophotosphere and the dusty ejecta would be required to reproduce the observed light curves , which is out of the scope of this paper .",
    "we carried out optical and nir photometry of nova v2362  cyg for @xmath123 days from the first maximum .",
    "our observation indicates the re - appearance of pseudophotosphere with @xmath119  k around the rebrightening maximum .",
    "the nir flux began to increase a week after the rebrightening maximum , accompanied with the steep decline of the optical flux .",
    "the @xmath25-band flux peaked at @xmath78 .",
    "the nir flux at the peak is well explained by the thermal dust emission with @xmath124  k. the dust temperature then decreased from @xmath116  k to @xmath125  k within 40 days .",
    "we estimate the dust mass of @xmath126@xmath127  m@xmath8 .",
    "this support that the dust would be formed preferentially from the material of the second outflow , if the dust formation would be triggered by the interaction between the second flow and initial one as suggested in @xcite .",
