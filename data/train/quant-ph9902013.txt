    "the interactions of different radiation modes through nonlinear crystals allow the generation of interesting states of light , which exhibit a rich variety of phenomena @xcite .",
    "most of the theoretical analysis usually refers to situations where one mode  the so - called `` pump '' mode  is placed in a high - amplitude coherent state . in such cases the parametric approximation",
    "is widely used to compute the dynamical evolution @xcite . in the parametric approximation the pump mode is classically treated as a @xmath0-number , thus neglecting both the depletion mechanism and quantum fluctuations . as a result , bilinear and trilinear hamiltonians",
    "are reduced to linear and quadratic forms in the field operators , respectively , and hence some useful mathematical tools  typically decomposition formulas for lie algebras  can be exploited for calculations @xcite .    in the validity regime of the parametric approximation",
    "different optical devices experimentally realize different fundamental unitary operators in quantum optics .",
    "for example , a beam splitter , by suitably mixing the signal state with a strong local oscillator at the same frequency , realizes the displacement operator , which generates coherent states from the vacuum .",
    "similarly , a degenerate parametric amplifier realizes the squeezing operator , which is the generator of the squeezed vacuum .",
    "finally , a nondegenerate parametric amplifier realizes the two - mode squeezing operator , i.e. the generator of twin - beam . in the above scenario ,",
    "it is matter of great interest to study the conditions under which the parametric approximation holds .",
    "this issue has been considered by a number of authors @xcite , however without giving a general validity criterion , which is the main concern of this paper .",
    "quantum effects in two - mode optical amplifiers have been extensively analyzed @xcite .",
    "frequency couplers with intensity dependent coupling have been studied @xcite , whereas the case of degenerate parametric amplifier has been considered by many authors @xcite .",
    "phase correlations @xcite and the signal - pump degree of entanglement @xcite have been examined .",
    "the effect of pump squeezing has been also considered @xcite . on the other hand , though trilinear processes have been thoroughly analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite , only little attention has been devoted to the parametric approximation in nondegenerate amplifiers @xcite .",
    "the most explicit conditions for the validity of the parametric approximation have been derived in refs . @xcite and @xcite , for the beam splitter and the degenerate parametric amplifier , respectively . in both references sufficient conditions",
    "have been derived , which however can be widely breached in relevant cases of interest , as we will show in the following .    in this paper",
    "we perform the exact numerical diagonalization of the full hamiltonians pertaining the three above - mentioned devices . as it was already noted by other authors @xcite such a numerical treatment",
    "is made amenable by the presence of constants of motion that characterizes each hamiltonian .",
    "in fact , the hilbert space can be decomposed into the direct sum of subspaces that are invariant under the action of the unitary evolution .",
    "therefore , one needs to diagonalize the hamiltonian just inside each invariant subspace , thus considerably reducing the dimension of the diagonalization space @xcite .",
    "we analyze in different sections the cases of the beam splitter , the degenerate parametric amplifier and the nondegenerate parametric amplifier .",
    "the case of the beam splitter can be treated analytically , but we also present some numerical results in order to introduce the general approach that will be used for the parametric amplifiers . for each device , we look for the conditions under which the parametric approximation holds , for both vacuum and non - vacuum input signal states .",
    "the comparison between the exact evolution and the theoretical predictions from the parametric approximation is made in terms of the overlap @xmath1 between the state @xmath2 that exits the device and the theoretical state @xmath3 obtained within the approximation .",
    "an explicit comparison in terms of photon number distributions and wigner functions is also given for some interesting and representative cases .",
    "the main result of the paper is to show that the usual requirements for the validity of the parametric approximation , namely short interaction time and strong classical undepleted pump , are too strict .",
    "indeed , we show that the only relevant requirement is the coherence of the pump after the interaction , rather than its undepletion .",
    "in fact , we will show typical examples in which the pump at the input is weak ( one photon in average ) , after the interaction it is highly depleted , and notwithstanding the parametric approximation still holds . on the other hand ,",
    "there are cases in which the pump after the interaction is only slightly depleted , however is no longer coherent , and the approximation fails .",
    "finally , we show some interesting features such as pump squeezing and schrdinger - cat - like state generation that arise when the parametric approximation breaks down .",
    "the beam splitter is a passive device that couples two different modes of radiation at the same frequency through a first - order susceptibility - tensor @xmath4 medium .",

    "<S> we perform the exact numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonians that describe both degenerate and nondegenerate parametric amplifiers , by exploiting the conservation laws pertaining each device . we clarify the conditions under which the parametric approximation holds , showing that the most relevant requirement is the coherence of the pump after the interaction , rather than its undepletion . </S>"
