    "there has been tremendous progress in producing ultra - cold gases of atoms with strong magnetic dipoles @xcite and heteronuclear molecules with strong electric dipoles @xcite .",
    "the defining feature of these systems is that the particles interact with a ddi that is long - ranged and anisotropic .",
    "this anisotropy  that side - by - side dipoles repel , whereas those in a head to tail configuration attract  significantly affects the properties of system .",
    "notably , the attractive component of the interaction can cause the system to become mechanically unstable and collapse .",
    "experiments using bose - einstein condensates have investigated the interplay between collapse and the geometry of the harmonic confinement potential @xcite ( also see @xcite ) and the collapse dynamics of the system @xcite .",
    "theoretical understanding of condensate stability is well developed for the nearly pure condensate @xcite ( providing a good description of experimental results @xcite ) and the partially condensed system @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the stability of normal bose and fermi gases are more poorly characterised .",
    "such systems should be well described by hartree - fock theory , however these calculations are challenging in the presence of a confining potential , particularly near instability .",
    "the hartree ( i.e.  direct interaction ) term is reasonably convenient to implement in an efficient and accurate manner in calculations .",
    "this term ( which is the only interaction term present in the gross - pitaevskii description of a dipolar condensate ) tends to distort the position space density to elongate along the direction that the dipoles are polarised .",
    "the fock term ( i.e.  exchange interaction ) is more difficult to implement , and for this reason is often neglected or treated approximately .",
    "this term tends to distort the momentum distribution in a manner that depends on the statistics of the particles @xcite , an effect that has recently been observed in a normal fermi gas @xcite . a detailed understanding of stability is required by polar molecule experiments because of the large dipole moments that can be obtained with these molecules .",
    "this understanding has to include both thermal and trapping effects , as to date these systems have not been cooled below the relevant degeneracy temperatures ( i.e.  fermi or condensation temperature ) , and high aspect ratio trapping potentials have been employed to suppress bimolecular chemical reaction rates @xcite . from a theoretical perspective , it is important to establish whether transitions to novel manybody states will occur before mechanical instability ( e.g.  see @xcite ) .",
    "the first treatments of stability for the fermi gas in a three - dimensional harmonic trap were based on hartree @xcite and simplified variational hartree - fock @xcite theories .",
    "those results were shown to significantly overestimate the critical dipole strength at which the system became unstable by zhang and yi , who performed the first full hartree fock calculations @xcite .",
    "instability in these calculations was identified by the numerical algorithm becoming unstable ( e.g.  failure to converge and development of density spikes ) .",
    "numerical instability is sensitive to grid choice and must be verified by careful convergence testing with refined grids .",
    "for the full hartree - fock calculations of a cylindrically symmetric trap , the system is represented by a four - dimensional distribution function , and the ability to refine the grid is constrained by computational resources .",
    "thus a major outstanding issue is to produce reliable and accurate predictions for the fermi stability .",
    "stability for the normal bose gas was considered in refs .",
    "@xcite at the level of hartree theory , and a variational hartree - fock theory @xcite , which is inapplicable near the critical temperature .",
    "the hartree calculations revealed that above , but close to the critical temperature , the bose gas can have a novel double instability feature when confined in an oblate trap with the dipoles polarised along the tightly confined direction .",
    "full calculations for the stability boundary of the normal bose gas have not been performed at the level of hartree fock theory , and an important question is whether the double instability feature survives when exchange interactions are included .    in this paper",
    "we develop a general theory of stability for trapped dipolar gases described by the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "we derive a result for the compressibility of the gas at trap centre that we use to identify the instability .",
    "we present results for the stability boundaries of bose and fermi gases as a function of temperature and trap geometry .",
    "importantly , we show that these boundaries can be accurately computed , and show that previous hartree - fock results for a dipolar fermi gas in an oblate trap significantly overestimate the stability region .",
    "our bose gas stability calculations are the first hartree - fock results for this system , and demonstrate that the double instability feature is robust to exchange interactions .",
    "we develop useful analytic results to describe the behaviour of the stability boundaries .",

    "we do not discuss aspects of the numerical solution here , but note that techniques for accurately solving these equations have been presented in @xcite .",
