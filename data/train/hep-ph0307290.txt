    "i outline the configuration space technique  @xcite .",
    "it can be used to verify the results obtained within other techniques  @xcite and to investigate some general questions of feynman diagram calculation  @xcite .",
    "the diagram with the sunrise topology form a subset of the general set of diagram with a given number of loops  @xcite .",

    "i will start this lecture series with explaining the basic elements that occur in calculating sunrise - type diagrams .",
    "the genuine sunrise diagram with three internal lines is shown on the left hand side in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .",
    "it is the leading order perturbative correction to the lowest order propagator in @xmath0-theory .",
    "the corresponding leading order perturbative correction in @xmath1-theory is a one - loop diagram and can be considered as a degenerate case of the prior example .",
    "a straightforward generalization of this topology is a correction to the free propagator in @xmath2-theory that contains @xmath3 loops and @xmath4 internal lines ( see the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) .    in configuration space ,",
    "the `` calculation '' of the correlator two - point function is very easy .",
    "it is just given by the product of the propagators , @xmath5 the propagators themselves ( for the scalar case and massive particles ) are solutions of the klein  gordon equation and can be written in @xmath6-dimensional euclidean space - time as @xmath7 where i used @xmath8 for convenience , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the modified bessel function of the second kind ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "frankly speaking , the propagator @xmath11 describes the propagation of a particle of mass @xmath12 from the space - time point @xmath13 to @xmath14 ( a situation which of course is invariant with respect to translation ) .",
    "for @xmath15 we obtain the massless propagator @xmath16 simply by calculating the limit , taking into account the series expansion of the bessel function @xmath17 which will be shown later on .",
    "modified internal lines can also occur , as a result of a reduction procedure of more complicated diagrams or as diagrams with mass insertion on a line .",
    "this insertions are indicated by one or more dots placed on the line .",
    "again , the representation of these cases is easily established , @xmath18 ( note that @xmath19 is related to the @xmath20-th derivative with respect to the parameter @xmath21 ) .",
    "it is obvious that , up to different power in @xmath14 and normalization , a modification of the internal line just changes the index of the bessel function .",
    "the modified propagator has the same functional form as the usual propagator .",
    "this matter of fact unifies and simplifies the considerations .",
    "the generalization to more complicated integrands with additional tensor structure @xmath22 is straightforward as well . because of @xmath23 this merely leads again to different orders of the bessel function , together with a tensor structure @xmath24 .",
    "however , these tensor structure does not matter in taking simply the product of the propagators .",
    "we can conclude that in order to obtain the expression for the correlator function in configuration space there is no integration at all .",
    "an integration occurs , if we want to calculate the correlator function in momentum space , being the fourier transform of @xmath25 , @xmath26 for a general tensor structure , the integral is calculated by expanding the plane wave function @xmath27 in a series of gegenbauer polynomials @xmath28 .",
    "the gegenbauer polynomials are a generalizations of associated legendre polynomials to the @xmath6-dimensional space - time .",
    "they are determined by the characteristic polynomial @xmath29 and are given by @xmath30 , @xmath31 and the recursion formula @xmath32 the gegenbauer polynomials satisfy the orthogonality relations ( @xmath33 ) @xmath34 on the @xmath6-dimensional unit sphere with rotationally invariant measure @xmath35 where @xmath36 expressed in terms of gegenbauer polynomials , the plane wave reads @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the bessel function of the first kind and @xmath39 .",
    "this formula allows one to single out an irreducible tensorial structure from the angular integration in the fourier integral .",
    "integration techniques involving gegenbauer polynomials for the computation of massless diagrams are described in detail in  @xcite where many useful relations can be found ( see also  @xcite ) . in case of absence of explicit tensorial structure ,",
    "however , the orthogonality relations for gegenbauer polynomials can be used to explicitely integrate over the unit sphere , @xmath40 in the following i will concentrate on this scalar case .",
    "the fourier transform of the sunrise - type diagram , therefore , is given by the one - dimensional integral @xmath41      while the configuration space expression for the sunrise - type diagram contains no integration , it does not always represent an integrable function for a generic value of space - time dimension @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath25 can have non - integrable singularities at small @xmath14 for a sufficiently large number of propagators when @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "the reason is that each propagator by itself can be considered as a distribution .",
    "however , distributions do not form an algebra and multiplication is not well - defined . in this respect",
    "the correlator function @xmath25 is not completely defined as a proper distribution . in attempting to integrate such a function over the whole @xmath14-space we encounter infinities which are usual uv divergencies .",
    "therefore , the computation of its fourier transform requires regularization ( for instance , dimensional regularization ) and subtraction .",
    "uv divergencies given as poles in @xmath43 for the dimensional regularization are related to short distances @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , one should expand massive propagators at small @xmath14 to obtain the counterterms .",
    "still a convergence at large @xmath14 should be retained which provides ir regularization ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this technical constraint can be met for instance by keeping one ( or two ) massive propagators unexpanded .",
    "the possibility is given because the integrals of one or two bessel functions are known  @xcite .",
    "however , one can do even simpler by using a damping function like @xmath44 to suppress contributions for large values of @xmath14 , corresponding to ir singularities .",
    "this is done by introducing the factor @xmath45 into the integrand . in this case",
    "all massive propagators along with the factor @xmath46 can be expanded in small values of @xmath14 .",
    "the expansion of the propagators is straightforward and results from the definitions @xmath47 and @xmath48 with @xmath49 therefore , one has @xmath50+o(z^4,z^{2 + 2\\lambda}).\\ ] ] the final integration can be done formally by using the identity @xmath51 as an example we consider the genuin sunrise diagram with three different masses @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , given in configuration space by @xmath55 the counterterms for the fourier transform @xmath56 are obtained by introducing @xmath57 and expanding the occuring bessel functions as well as @xmath46 .",
    "the singular parts we obtain for dimensional regularization with @xmath58 , i.e.@xmath59 , are given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "note , though , that the result is given in euclidean domain . in this way one",
    "easily finds pole parts for any diagram with any mass arrangement .",
    "renormalization by momentum subtraction is the oldest renormalization method .",
    "the idea is to subtract the integrand in some specific momentum point . for massive diagrams",
    "the point @xmath62 is ir - safe , and the receipe is realized for instance by expanding the function @xmath63 which is the kernel or weight function of the integral transformation ) in a taylor series around @xmath62 in terms of a polynomial series in @xmath64 .",
    "the subtraction of order @xmath65 is achieved by writing @xmath66_n",
    "= \\left(\\frac{px}2\\right)^{-\\lambda}j_\\lambda(px )    -\\sum_{k=0}^n\\frac{(-1)^k}{k!\\gamma(\\lambda+k+1 ) }    \\left(\\frac{px}2\\right)^{2k}\\ ] ] and by keeping @xmath65 terms in the expansion on the right hand side .",
    "the number @xmath65 of necessary subtractions is determined by the divergence index of the diagram and can be found according to the standard rules of the @xmath67-operation  @xcite . for the example we started with , a momentum subtraction which is symmetric in the masses @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 leads to the finite part @xmath68_nd(x , m_1)d(x , m_2)d(x , m_3 )    x^{2\\lambda+1}e^{\\mu^2x^2}e^{-\\mu^2x^2}dx\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the order of expansion which has to be chosen for integrability .",
    "this is of course the same order which has been used earlier in order to extract the counterterms .",
    "it is obvious , though , that the expansion can cease at positive powers of @xmath14 .",
    "finally , @xmath69 can be taken to calculate the finite part . as a technical remark note that most numerical integration routines will run into problems if the upper limit is kept to be infinity . however , alread for values of the order @xmath70 the integrand is negligible , so that the integration can terminate at this point .",
    "also the region about the origin might cause trouble . in this case",
    "the integration interval can be subdivided close to the origin , and the whole integrand for the subinterval to zero can be expanded in @xmath14 as a whole . for specific values of @xmath64 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 we could reproduce results given in the literature ( e.g.  results given in  @xcite ) .",
    "the second example i want to show here starts with the same genuine sunrise diagram but is evaluated for a special setting of the masses .",
    "the reason is that there exists an analytical expression in the literature  @xcite . in this example",
    "the subtraction is done in several steps .",
    "the first step consists of a momentum subtraction for the weight function with @xmath71 .",
    "we obtain @xmath72 \\tilde\\pi_{\\rm mom}(p)&=&2\\pi^{\\lambda+1}\\int_0^\\infty    \\left[{\\left(\\frac{px}{2}\\right)}^{-\\lambda}j_\\lambda(px)\\right]_1d(x , m_1)d(x , m_2)d(x , m_3 )    x^{2\\lambda+1}dx\\ = \\nonumber\\\\&=&2\\pi^{\\lambda+1}\\int_0^\\infty    \\left[{\\left(\\frac{px}{2}\\right)}^{-\\lambda}j_\\lambda(px)-\\frac1{\\gamma(\\lambda+1 ) }    + \\frac{p^2x^2}4\\frac1{\\gamma(\\lambda+2)}\\right]\\    \\times\\nonumber\\\\&&\\qquad\\times\\ d(x , m_1)d(x , m_2)d(x , m_3)x^{2\\lambda+1}dx ,    \\\\[7pt ] \\tilde\\pi_{\\rm rem}(p)&=&a+p^2b\\ = \\nonumber\\\\[3pt ]    & = & \\frac{2\\pi^{\\lambda+1}}{\\gamma(\\lambda+1)}\\int_0^\\infty    d(x , m_1)d(x , m_2)d(x , m_3)x^{2\\lambda+1}dx\\,+\\nonumber\\\\&&\\qquad    -p^2\\frac{2\\pi^{\\lambda+1}}{4\\gamma(\\lambda+2)}\\int_0^\\infty    x^2d(x , m_1)d(x , m_2)d(x , m3)x^{2\\lambda+1}dx.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the analytical result in  @xcite is given at the pseudothreshold @xmath73 .",

    "the result reads @xmath92 this result corresponds to the quantity @xmath93 in  @xcite which is the simplest basis element for the computation of massive three - loop diagrams in a general three - loop topology considered in  @xcite .",
    "we obtain agreement with  @xcite .      from the physical point of view",
    "the interesting part of the analysis of sunrise - type diagrams is the construction of the spectral decomposition of the diagrams .",
    "for the two - point correlation function we determine the discontinuity across the physical cut in the complex plane of the squared momentum , @xmath94 .",
    "taking for instance the @xmath95 sunrise - type diagram with two different masses @xmath52 , @xmath53 in arbitrary dimensions , in ( euclidean ) momentum space given by @xmath96 the physical cut has influence on the integral for @xmath97 .",
    "with @xmath98 we can calculate the discontinuity to obtain @xmath99 for @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the two zeros of the integrand which can be decomposed into @xmath103 .",
    "the spectral density is given by the discontinuity divided by @xmath104 .",

    "( [ rhom1m2 ] ) is of need in the following which is the reason why i have given some details about the calculation . in the third lecture",
    "we will see that configuration space technique allows for some other efficient tool for determining the spectral density , namely by inverting the so - called @xmath108-transform . in the next lecture",
    "i will continue with today s examples and give recurrence relations which allow to reduce the result to a finite set of master integrals , expressible in terms of transcendental numbers .",
    "i continue the previous lecture by introducing just three other examples for calculating an sunrise - type diagram with the help of configuration space techniques in order to compare them with results in the literature .",
    "a wide field of diagrams to compare with is a subclass of three - loop bubbles @xmath109  @xcite , namely @xmath110 with two propagators absent ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "actually we choose the remaining indices @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 in a way that the results become finite , but we not only calculate the finite part but also the part porportional to @xmath43 in order to compare with  @xcite . written in configuration space , the particular subset of bubble diagrams @xmath109 is given by @xmath116 it is obvious that we end up with integrals of products of four bessel functions with non - integer indices and a non - integer power of @xmath14 .",
    "the plan for today s lecture is as follows : after introducing the results for the three examples in terms of these integrals , i will show that at least the expansion up to first order in @xmath43 is possible analytically .",
    "i will then introduce a reduction procedure in order to reduce the integrals to a basic set of two master integrals , @xmath117 and will add considerations on the general class of basic integrals @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",

    "it is this region that saturates the integral in the limit @xmath239 or , equivalently , @xmath240 .",
    "it is convenient to perform the analysis in a basis where the integrand has a simple large @xmath14 behaviour . the most important part of the integrand is the bessel function @xmath241 which , however , contains both rising and falling branches at large @xmath14 .",
    "it resembles the situation with the elementary trigonometric function @xmath242 to which the bessel function @xmath38 is rather close in a certain sense , as we will see .",
    "@xmath242 is a linear combination of exponentials , @xmath243 in the same manner , the bessel function @xmath38 can be written as a sum of two hankel functions @xmath244 , @xmath245 and for pure imaginary argument the hankel functions show simple asymptotic behaviour @xmath246 accordingly , we split up @xmath247 into @xmath248 with @xmath249 the two parts @xmath250 of the polarization function @xmath247 have completely different behaviour near threshold and are analyzed independently in the following .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath251 for large @xmath14 is given by the asymptotic form of the functions which i simply write up to the leading terms as @xmath252 we conclude that the large @xmath14 range of the integral ( above a reasonably large cutoff parameter @xmath253 ) has the general form @xmath254 the right hand side is an analytic function in @xmath255 in the vicinity of @xmath256 .",
    "it exhibits no cut or other singularities near the threshold and therefore does not contribute to the spectral density .",
    "i could therefore go ahead to the second contribution @xmath257 .",
    "however , i want to do a bit more in order to fill @xmath251 with `` life '' ( i.e. , meaning ) . in using the relation",
    "@xmath258      in contrast to the previous case , the integrand of the part @xmath257 contains @xmath259 which behaves like a rising exponential function at large @xmath14 , @xmath260 therefore , the integral has the large @xmath14 behaviour @xmath261 the exponential factor @xmath262 which establishes an effective inverse proportionality between @xmath255 and @xmath14 is the reason for the importance of the large @xmath14 behaviour as being essential for the near threshold expansion of the spectral density .",
    "however , for @xmath263 the integral diverges at the upper limit , leading to non - analyticity at the threshold @xmath256 . in the complex @xmath255 plane with a cut along the negative real axis",
    "the integral is analytic .",
    "this cut corresponds to the physical positive energy cut .",
    "the discontinuity across the cut gives rise to the non - vanishing spectral density of the contribution @xmath257 .    in order to obtain an expansion for the spectral density near the threshold in an analytical form we make use of the asymptotic series expansion for the function @xmath25 that crucially simplifies the integrands but still preserves the singular structure of the integral in terms of the variable @xmath255 . because of the already mentioned asymptotic expansion @xmath264 the asymptotic expansion of the function @xmath25 consists of an exponential factor @xmath265 and an inverse power series in @xmath14 up to an order @xmath266 closely related to @xmath65 .",
    "it is this asymptotic expansion that determines the singularity structure of the integral .",
    "we write the whole integral in the form of the sum of two terms again , @xmath267 the integrand of the difference term @xmath268 behaves as @xmath269 at large @xmath14 while the integrand of the second term accumulates all lower powers of the large @xmath14 expansion .",
    "we will again consider the two parts in turn .",
    "however , a comment on the regularization is in order here .",
    "being interested only in the large @xmath14 behaviour , we introduced a cutoff @xmath253 which necessary at least at this point because the asymptotic expansions are not defined for small values of @xmath14 and lead to divergences .",
    "however , from the practical point of view the calculation of the regularized integrals with an explicit cutoff is inconvenient . instead",
    ", the standar way to cope with such a situation is to use dimensional regularization .",
    "note that dimensional regularization does not necessarily regularize all divergences in this case ( in contrast to the standard case of ultraviolett divergences ) but nevertheless is sufficient for our purposes .",
    "therefore , we use a parameter @xmath43 independent of @xmath270 to regularize the divergences at small  @xmath14 .      in @xmath268 the subtracted asymptotic series to order @xmath65 cancels the inverse power behaviour of the integrand to this degree @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , the integrand decreases sufficently fast for large values of @xmath14 and the integral even converges for @xmath256 .",
    "the part @xmath268 is regular and gives no contribution to the spectral density up to the order @xmath271 .",
    "the integral @xmath272 is still rather complicated to compute .",
    "but we can go a step further in its analytical evaluation . indeed , since the singular behaviour of @xmath272 is determined by the behaviour at large @xmath14 , we can replace the first factor , i.e.  the hankel function , in the large @xmath14 region by its asymptotic expansion up to some order @xmath65 , @xmath273\\ ] ] with @xmath274,\\qquad ( \\lambda , n):=\\frac{\\gamma(\\lambda+n-1/2)}{n!\\gamma(\\lambda - n-1/2)}\\ ] ] to obtain the double asymptotic representation @xmath275 both asymptotic expansions are straightforward and can be obtained from standard handbooks on bessel functions .",
    "we therefore arrive at our final result : the integration necessary for evaluating the near threshold expansion of the sunrise - type diagrams reduces to integrals of euler s gamma function type , i.e.  integrals containing exponentials and powers in the integrand .",
    "indeed , the result of the asymptotic expansion of the integrand is an exponential function @xmath262 times a power series in @xmath276 , namely @xmath277 where @xmath278 has already been used earlier and the coefficients @xmath279 are simple functions of the momentum @xmath230 and the masses @xmath280 . this expression can be integrated analytically using @xmath281 the result is @xmath282 this expression is our final representation for the part of the polarization function of a sunrise - type diagram necessary for the calculation of the spectral density near the production threshold . starting from this main result in eq .",
    "( [ serint ] ) , i discuss the general structure in some detail . in the case where @xmath283 takes integer values",
    ", these coefficients result in @xmath284-divergences for small values of @xmath43 .",
    "the powers of @xmath255 in eq .",
    "( [ serint ] ) have to be expanded to first order in @xmath43 and give @xmath285 because of @xmath286 @xmath287 in eq .",
    "( [ serint ] ) contributes to the spectral density .",
    "for half - integer values of @xmath283 the power of @xmath255 itself has a cut even for @xmath69 .",
    "the discontinuity is then given by @xmath288 our method to construct a threshold expansion thus simply reduces to the analytical calculation of the part @xmath289 which can be done for arbitrary dimension and an arbitrary number of lines with different masses . in the next subsections i work out some specific examples which demonstrate both the simplicity and efficiency of our method .      for the genuine sunrise diagram with equal masses ( the last restriction for reasons of representation only ) , the double asymptotic expansion reads @xmath290 the spectral density is obtained by performing the term - by - term integration of the series and by evaluating the discontinuity across the cut along the positive energy axis @xmath291 .",
    "the result reads @xmath292 where the notation @xmath293 , @xmath294 is used  @xcite .",
    "the simplicity of this derivation is striking and easily reproduces the expansion coefficients in  @xcite . for different orders the result",
    "is compared with the exact result from inverse @xmath108-transform ( eq .  ( [ invktrans ] ) ) in fig .",
    "[ fig05 ] .",
    "the sunrise - type diagram with four or more propagators can not be easily done by using the momentum space technique because it requires the multiloop integration of entangled momenta . within the configuration space technique",
    "the generalization to any number of lines ( or loops ) is immediate by no effort . for the spectral density of the equal mass @xmath186 sunrise - type diagram we obtain ( cf .",
    "[ fig06 ] ) @xmath295 where @xmath293 and @xmath296 is the threshold value .",
    "one sees the difference with the previous three - line case . in eq .",
    "( [ pidas440 ] ) the cut represents the square root branch while in the three - line case it was a logarithmic cut .",
    "this underlines my earlier considerations .",
    "as we have seen , the threshold expansion for equal ( or close ) masses breaks down for @xmath297 .",
    "however , if the masses are not equal , the region of the breakdown of the expansion is determined by the mass with the smallest numerical value . actually , one finds a breakdown at @xmath298 where @xmath299 is a mass much smaller than the others . to our best knowledge",
    ", this issue has not been touched earlier . in the following",
    "i will describe a technique called resummation of the smallest mass contribution  @xcite . instead of the double asymptotic expansion we use the partial asymptotic expansion @xmath300 where the asymptotic expansions are substituted for all propagators except for the one with the smallest mass @xmath299 , @xmath301 because of the knowledge of @xmath302 with @xmath303 and @xmath304 , @xmath305 is expressible in terms of hypergeometric functions  @xcite .",
    "the same is valid for the spectral density , because @xmath306 where @xmath307 . for the case of an @xmath95 sunrise - type diagram with masses @xmath12 and @xmath308 we compare the exact result in eq .",
    "( [ invktrans ] ) for the spectral density with the pure expansion near threshold      ( @xmath310 , the second order asymptotic expansion should suffice to show the general features in a short and concise form ) with the resummed result @xmath311 having used @xmath69 for the finite spectral density , the first term in curly braces of eq .",
    "( [ pipas42 t ] ) is obviously equal to @xmath312 in this limit because the first parameter of the hypergeometric function vanishes .",
