    "imaging detector arrays based on transition edge sensors ( tes ) are a maturing technology for a range of both earth and space - base applications , such as infrared astronomy , x - ray astronomy , and material analysis .",
    "squid - based multiplexed readout is needed to obtain a detector noise limited readout chain .",
    "multiplexing in this context implies that multiple tes signals which overlap in time and phase space are made mathematically independent so that they can be transported through a shared readout chain without losing information , by multiplying each tes signal with an independent carrier and subsequently adding these modulated tes signals .",
    "the various multiplexing variants which are being developed can be ordered based on their modulating element .",
    "we distinguish the variants in which the squid is the multiplying element which mounts the signal on a carrier , and the variant in which the tes mounts the signal on the carrier ( fdm ) .",
    "for the first category the tes is biased with a direct voltage ( dc ) , and the modulated signals are separated in the time domain ( tdm)@xcite , or frequency domain ( microwave squid multiplexing @xcite or code domain multiplexing @xcite ) . for the second category the tes is biased with an alternating voltage ( ac ) , and the modulated signals are separated in the frequency domain ( fdm)@xcite .    for both variants of multiplexing the signals",
    "have to be bandwidth limited to prevent addition of wide - band noise by using an inductor as low - pass filter , or an inductor and capacitor in series as band - pass filter , respectively .",
    "an important difference between the two categories of multiplexing within the context of this paper , is the property that for case of squid - based modulation the bias sources of the teses are commonly shared between pixels to lower the total wire count , with the consequence that the set points of the pixels can not be chosen individually , whereas for the case of tes - based modulation the tes bias sources are independent and therefore multiplexed .",
    "this reduces the wire count and makes the working points of the pixels individually adjustable .",
    "the individual bias setting per pixel can also be used to change the impedance of the tes bias source for each pixel by applying feedback to the applied bias voltage based on the measured tes current .",
    "this type of feedback has been proposed in different incarnations and for different purposes .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that with this type of feedback the effective thermal decay time of x - ray detectors can be made shorter when the effective internal resistance of bias source is made negative , i.e. @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the operating resistance of the tes , and @xmath4 the total series resistance in the tes bias circuit .",
    "the same feedback topology has also been applied to compensate parasitic resistances in the tes bias circuit @xcite , to increase the stiffness of the voltage bias and thereby the electro thermal feedback ( etf ) loop gain , leaving a ( slightly ) net positive resistance @xmath5 in the voltage source .",
    "recently , the authors of this paper proposed @xcite to use the regime of @xmath6 for bolometer operation , so that the tes resistance is kept constant under optical loading , and that the small signal parameters of the tes change minimally under optical loading .",
    "as a result , the linearity of the detector is optimised , and the dependence of the cross talk on the signal level is minimised .    in this paper",
    ", we show the first experimental results which demonstrate that operation in the regime where @xmath6 is stable both for single pixel and for multiplexed operation , and that the signal - to - noise ratio of the tes - based detector is conserved under the rll with respect to voltage bias . for practical reasons",
    "the experiments have been divided over two setups .",
    "the comparison of the signal - to - noise ratio was performed in a bolometer pixel with a low nep of @xmath7w/@xmath1 .",
    "the multiplexing experiment was performed with x - ray micro calorimeters , because pulse - tube induced micro - vibrations allowed for stable operation of only one pixel in the bolometer multiplexer during this particular experiment .",
    "-curve of a bolometer pixel as taken under voltage bias .",
    "the pixel consists of a tes and absorber on a sin island , which is suspended by four sin legs of @xmath8 .",
    "the size of the tiau tes equals @xmath9 m , with @xmath10  mk , a bias power level of @xmath11  fw , and a measured dark nep of @xmath7w/@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the bias points under which the pixel has been characterised using the rll are indicated with the crosses . ]",
    "the experiments were performed with a 3-pixel fdm setup with integrated lithographic 8-pixel @xmath12 bandpass filters @xcite , and a two - pixel x - ray fdm setup , both with baseband feedback ( bbfb ) electronics which provides squid linearisation and signal demodulation .",
    "the rll was integrated in the firmware of the bbfb electronics , following the block diagram as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "the system is adjusted such that the dissipative tes current @xmath13 is aligned fully in the @xmath14-channel of the readout .",
    "the @xmath15-channel feedback is required to ensure stability of the bbfb system .",
    "the output of the @xmath14-channel , i.e. the measured tes current , is multiplied with a constant ( @xmath16 ) , which is proportional to the resulting set point resistance of the tes , as the applied bias voltage @xmath17 .",
    "the switch toggles between the ( standard ) voltage bias condition and the rll mode .",
    "to demonstrate the stability of the rll , and to compare the signal - to - noise ratio of a bolometer pixel under voltage bias and the rll , a typical bolometer pixel under development for the sw band of safari @xcite was used , at a bias frequency of 1.46  mhz .",
    "the pixel consists of a tes and absorber on a sin island , which is suspended by four sin legs of @xmath8 .",
    "the size of the tiau tes equals @xmath9 m , with @xmath10  mk , a bias power level of @xmath11  fw , and a measured dark nep of @xmath7w/@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the pixel has been characterised for a range of bias points in the transition under both voltage bias and the rll .",
    "the current - voltage characteristic of the pixel as obtained under voltage bias is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : ivcurve ] .",
    "the bias points which have been characterised using the rll are marked with crosses .",
    "the latter range is limited because of electrothermal stability constraints , which originate from the much higher electrothermal loop gain under the rll@xcite , in combination with the fact that the circuit was originally designed for operation under voltage bias only .",
    "before discussing the results , we need to consider that under voltage bias the observed current noise spectra density and the noise equivalent power ( nep ) scale linearly , as the bias voltage is kept constant . under the rll",
    "the situation is different , as not the bias voltage is kept constant , but the tes resistance instead . as a result ,",
    "the detector nep is proportional to the tes bias current @xmath18 squared , as the dissipated power equals @xmath19 . in the small signal limit",
    "this implies that to calculate the nep the observed current noise spectral density must be multiplied by 2 , as the square of the observed current @xmath18 equals @xmath20 in the small signal limit .    from the rll small signal model it follows that the detector nep is equal under voltage bias and the rll",
    "this implies that also the information bandwidth of the detector , i.e. the frequency at which the phonon noise and johnson noise of the detector are equal , is the same under rll and voltage bias .",
    "it also follows from the small signal model that the measured current noise spectral densities under voltage bias and the rll cross sect at the information bandwidth . for frequencies above the information bandwidth of the detector , but below the electrical bandwidth , the behaviours diverge . for that regime under voltage bias",
    "we expect to observe the current noise spectral density corresponding to a resistor of @xmath21 , whereas under the rll this resistor value equals @xmath22 .",
    "the measured current noise power spectral densities for four different bias points ( @xmath23 0.55 , 0.58 , 0.62 , and 0.74 ) in the transition are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rll - vb - noise ] . to make a direct comparison with the noise power spectral density under voltage bias possible ,",
    "the spectra as measured under the rll have been multiplied by a factor of two , as discussed above . as a result of this multiplication ,",
    "the information band is not found anymore at the cross section between the spectra , but at the frequency where the difference equals a factor of 2 .",
    "note that as we intend to do a relative comparison , and because we do nt have an optical signal source available to measure the responsivity of the detector , the observed current noise spectral density has not been converted into calibrated nep values .",
    "instead , we present the current noise spectral densities .",
    "it is clear that in the low frequency region , i.e. @xmath24  hz which is within the information bandwidth of the detector , the noise spectra overlap , as was to be expected as discussed above .",
    "we also observe that for higher frequencies the observed noise power is much higher for the rll than under voltage bias .",
    "this qualitatively scales with the expected factor @xmath25 , assuming that @xmath26 .",
    "unfortunately impedance data is lacking for this detector so that a quantitative comparison is not possible .",
    "however , the onset of electrothermal oscillations between 1 and 2  khz shows that the thermal bandwidth of the detector , which is approximately equal to the information bandwidth ( @xmath27  hz ) , has indeed shifted with a significant factor of @xmath28 with respect to the situation under voltage bias .      to demonstrate that the rll can also be applied for multiple pixels simultaneously , we put two x - ray microcalorimeter pixels simultaneously under resistance locking .",
    "it was found that the pixels operated stable , and that the observed dynamic behaviour and nep did not change when the second pixel was added ( not shown ) .",
    "note that the observed currents are used for biasing the tess , to close the rll ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) . as an illustration of the resulting beating in the current",
    "is shown in the time domain plot in fig .",
    "[ fig:2pix ] .",
    "frequency domain multiplexing makes it possible to create a resistance locked loop per pixel , as the pixel bias voltages are multiplexed and therefore individually tuneable .",
    "the rll improves detector speed , linearity and dynamic range for bolometer operation .",
    "it was shown that for fdm resistance locking can easily be integrated in the digital baseband feedback electronics which is used for demodulation and squid linearisation .",
    "it was found that within the information bandwidth of the detector the observed neps are equal , and that closing multiple loops simultaneously does not impair the stability of the system . when combined with the earlier observation @xcite that for tes - based bolometers the performance under ac bias is equal to under dc bias , we believe that this mode of operation is suitable for larger tes - based bolometer applications .",
