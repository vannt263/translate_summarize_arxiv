    "quantum entanglement of a system , perceived as a resource in quantum information and communication protocols , quantifies the correlations between the parts of the system@xcite .",
    "the entanglement entropy is a widely - used entanglement measure , along with many other measures , that has been used to investigate quantum phase transitions in spin systems@xcite . in particular , in the vicinity of critical points , the spin correlation functions exhibit long - range behaviour , which reflects on the behaviour of the entanglement .",
    "thus , it is interesting to study the well - known models of interacting electron / spin systems from the entanglement perspective@xcite . in this article",
    ", we study the block entanglement for correlated electron states at half filling and for other filling factors .",
    "interacting electron systems have more structure than interacting spin qubit systems in the way of more states per site",
    ". we can take them to have two qubits per site , a qubit each for the charge and the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "this severely restricts numerical investigation to studying a finite system with a substantially - fewer number of sites than that of spin systems . for a system of @xmath1 sites ,",
    "the hilbert space dimension varies from @xmath3 for uncorrelated electrons to @xmath4 for strongly - correlated electrons ( corresponding to infinite repulsion between electrons ) . in this article",
    ", we study the strong correlation effect on the entanglement entropy for the one - dimensional gutzwiller state@xcite . in this state",
    ", the strong on - site correlation effect of the hubbard model ground state , is implemented through the action of a projection operator on the non - interacting metallic state .",
    "the metallic state , vis .",
    "the fermi ground state which is constructed from occupying lowest - lying one - electron states for both up and down spin electrons , has no correlation between up and down spin electrons .",
    "viewed from occupation of site - basis states , it has states with doubly - occupied sites with largest probability .",
    "the projection operator gives a weighted amplitude to a basis state with doubly - occupied sites , so that the doubly - occupied sites occur with a probability weight that is determined by the correlation effect .",
    "the entanglement in a bipartite system is defined as the von neumann entropy of bipartition . consider a composite system comprised of two independent parts , say @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the entanglement between @xmath5 and @xmath6 in a pure state of the composite system is given by von neumann entropy of the part @xmath7 ( or equivalently of part @xmath6 ) , given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the reduced density matrix of @xmath5 obtained by a partial trace over the hilbert space of @xmath6 .",
    "since , the reduced density matrix of the subsystem may not correspond to a pure state , though the parent state is a pure state , it can give rise to an entropy for the subsystem , thus a possibility of the quantum entanglement arises .",
    "the amount of this entanglement entropy itself is a measure of the quantum correlations between the two subsystems .",
    "scaling of entanglement entropy with the size of the subsystem has been an important tool to explore the role of quantum correlations in many - body systems . unlike , the physical observables such as the internal energy , the entropy and the magnetization which are extensive quantities that are proportional to the volume of the system , the entanglement entropy , along with many other measures of entanglement , is not extensive . in this connection",
    "the area law has been proposed@xcite which says that the entanglement entropy scales as the area of the surface separating the two subsystems . in one dimension , this means it is a constant , as the surface consists of just one point .",
    "the understanding behind the area law is that for systems with short - ranged interactions , the quantum correlations between the two subsystems should occur close to the boundary surface separating the two subsystems .",
    "however , area law is modified by a logrithimic correction for gapless spin systems , which are known to be in a critical regime@xcite .",
    "this is because in the critical regime , the correlation length diverges , and correlations remain non - zero even at very large length scales . for one dimension",
    ", an explicit result has been obtained for gapless spin systems using conformal field theory ( cft ) which describes the continuum limit for such systems @xcite .",
    "the result relates the coefficient of logarithmic correction to the central charge of the theory . for a system of @xmath1 sites",
    "the entanglement entropy , between part @xmath5 consisting of a block of @xmath10 contiguous sites and the part @xmath6 containing the rest of the sites , shows a universal behavior , given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the central charge of the underlying cft , and @xmath13 is a non - universal constant of @xmath14 .    the success of entanglement entropy scaling has lead to various proposals for ways to measure it experimentally @xcite .",
    "with these , entanglement entropy has ceased to be a merely theoretical tool .",
    "we will see later how the entanglement scaling can be used to infer a metal - insulator transition in finite - sized chains of correlated electrons .",
    "the standard technique for calculating entanglement entropy for a pure state is through the schmidt decomposition@xcite of a bipartite state .",
    "an arbitrary pure bipartite state can be written , using direct product basis states of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , as @xmath15 where @xmath16 labels an orthonormal basis of the part @xmath17 .",
    "let the dimension of the hilbert space of @xmath17 be @xmath18 , and let @xmath19 .",
    "we can view the amplitude @xmath20 as an element of a matrix @xmath21 of dimension @xmath22 by @xmath23 .",
    "though there are @xmath24 number of wave function amplitudes in the above state , the above state can be brought to the schmidt form containing atmost @xmath22 terms . on first performing the independent sum over @xmath25 in the above for a fixed state @xmath26 of the part @xmath5",
    ", we get @xmath22 number of states for @xmath6 , labelled by @xmath26 , i.e. @xmath27 .",
    "these superposition states of @xmath6 may not form orthonormal basis .",
    "after the process of orthogonalization of these @xmath22 states we get an effective sum , with a square matrix @xmath28 of dimension @xmath22 .",
    "the schmidt numbers and the schmidt basis states are obtained from diagonalising the effective matrix .",
    "thus , the above state can be written in a schmidt - decomposed form , given by    @xmath29    where the schmidt numbers @xmath30 are given by the eigenvalues of @xmath31 , and the basis states for @xmath5 and @xmath6 are linear combinations of the original bases .",
    "the maximum number of non - zero schmidt numbers is given by @xmath22 , and hence the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix for both @xmath5 and @xmath6 are equal .",
    "it is straightforward to get the entanglement entropy ( as @xmath30 are the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix @xmath9 ) ,    @xmath32    the dependence of the entanglement on the correlation effect is carried by the schmidt numbers .    even though the case for spin systems in one dimension has been thoroughly explored via entanglement entropy as well as the entanglement spectrum , the same is not true for correlated electron systems .",
    "the goal of the present work is to investigate these measures using the gutzwiller state as a prototype state of correlated electron systems .",
    "we will see later that the entanglement entropy , for equal bipartition in the gutzwiller state follows the logarithmic relation given in eq.2 , for all parameter regime . however at half filling",
    ", a size - independent central charge can be assigned only at the two limits of uncorrelated metallic state at one end ( with @xmath33 ) and a strongly - correlated insulating state at the other end ( @xmath34 ) . in the metal - insulator crossover regime",
    ", the coefficient shows a system - size dependence , thus not conforming to a cft prediction .",
    "the simplest model that has the essential ingredients of de - localized lattice electrons and a screened coulomb interaction is the hubbard model@xcite , given as    @xmath35    here , @xmath36 creates an electron with the given spin projection at site @xmath26 , and @xmath37 is the corresponding number operator .",
    "the first represents the hopping of electrons on nearest - neighbour sites , with an amplitude @xmath38 .",
    "the strong correlation ( which is just on - site density - density interaction ) arises from the second term , where @xmath39 is the interaction strength .",
    "even though analytical solution exists in one dimension , a theoretical treatment is made very tedious by the fact that the kinetic term is diagonal in momentum basis whereas the interaction term is diagonal in site basis .",
    "a variational approach to the problem was proposed by gutzwiller @xcite , suggesting a trial ground state where correlations were introduced into the non - interacting metallic state by a local correlation factor in site basis@xcite .",
    "the gutzwiller state is written , for a lattice of @xmath1 sites , as @xmath40    where the metallic fermi state @xmath41 is constructed from the vacuum state by using products of momentum space operators @xmath42 . here , @xmath43 is the fermi momentum which is controlled by the filling factor .",
    "the correlation projection parameter @xmath44 varies from 0 to 1 , incorporating the correlation effect of the hubbard-@xmath39 .",
    "the insulating limit corresponds to @xmath45 or @xmath46 and the metallic limit is @xmath47 or @xmath48 . at half - filling ,",
    "the two limits describe a change from completely de - localised state ( @xmath49 ) to completely localised state ( @xmath50 ) , giving rise to a metal to insulator transition .",
    "an exact calculation by metzner and vollhardt @xcite gives a relation between @xmath0 and @xmath51 , at half - filling in one dimension , we have , @xmath52    gutzwiller state provides a simple example of a fermi liquid@xcite .",
    "certain properties of fermi liquid state of transition metals calculated from the gutzwiller state have been compared with experiments .",
    "the properties of ni @xcite as well as of normal liquid @xmath53he @xcite which can be treated as a fermi liquid , have been successfully described by the gutzwiller state .",
    "fermi liquids are characterised by a sharp fermi surface , i.e. a discontinuity at the fermi level in the single - particle momentum distribution .",
    "however , in one dimension fermi liquids usually break down into luttinger liquids which do not have the discontinuity at the fermi level .",
    "interestingly , this discontinuity and fermi - liquid behavior have been seen to occur in some finite - size systems even in one dimension@xcite .",
    "the gutzwiller state shows the discontinuity at the fermi level for non - zero @xmath0 , thus differing in this respect from the physics of one - dimensional hubbard model . this fermi surface discontinuity for a one - dimensional system at half - filling",
    "is given by@xcite , @xmath54 at @xmath50 , the discontinuity disappears and the system passes to an insulating state ( brinkman - rice insulator@xcite ) . near the insulating regime , another quantity of interest which goes to zero is the average density of doubly - occupied sites , which is given in one dimension by@xcite @xmath55\\label{double}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the number density of electrons .",
    "though the gutzwiller state is an well - explored state and many exact results are known , entanglement properties of the state remain fairly unexplored . in a previous work ,",
    "the global entanglement of gutzwiller state , which measures the average site purity in the state , was investigated@xcite .",
    "it was seen to be directly related to the average double occupancy of gutzwiller state .",
    "the entanglement for the strongly - correlated case was seen to be smaller than that of the uncorrelated metallic state for most filling factors .",
    "this was mainly due to the fact that a strong correlation ( a large @xmath39 ) enhances diagonal spin correlation functions , whereas usually entanglement is enhanced by off - diagonal correlations and decreased by diagonal correlations , as seen in heisenberg antiferromagnets@xcite . in this work ,",
    "we investigate the entanglement entropy and entanglement spectrum of the gutzwiller state in one dimension .",
    "entanglement entropy @xmath57 as a function of the number of sites @xmath1 is shown for various values of on - site correlation factor @xmath0 at half - filling .",
    "continuous lines show verification of cft results for the metallic and the insulating limits , given in eq.[c ] . ]",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     at least in the region where the data collapse is good , i.e , when @xmath58 , we can now check whether our ansatz for @xmath59 given in eq [ e(y ) ] is valid . to check for this",
    "we calculate @xmath60 , given by : @xmath61 if our ansatz eq .",
    "[ e(y ) ] is valid , @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , a plot of @xmath63 against @xmath64 should be a data collapsed straight line passing through origin for @xmath65 .",
    "this is exactly what is seen .",
    "( fig [ ve1 ] ) .",
    "this means the ansatz eq . [ e(y ) ] is valid in this limit .",
    "however as @xmath60 ( and hence @xmath66 ) approaches @xmath67 , the data collapse becomes slightly worse .",
    "for @xmath68 ( not shown in fig [ ve1 ] ) , there is no data collapse at all , proving that the ansatz is not valid in this range .",
    "thus the range of @xmath69 for which eq . [ e(y ) ] is valid is : @xmath70 we have seen from in the previous section that when eq . [",
    "e(y ) ] is valid , metal - insulator crossover point is at @xmath71 . thus eq . [ e(y ) ] will continue to describe the metal - insulator crossover point as long as @xmath72 .",
    "this condition yields a corresponding range of @xmath1 , which is : @xmath73    so , for system sizes in this range we have located the metal - insulator crossover point .",
    "this range of system sizes is physically realized in nanochains .",
    "nanochains are typically @xmath74 long with lattice spacing @xmath75 , thereby having @xmath76 .",
    "thus our results provide an understanding of metal - insulator transition in nanochains of strongly correlated materials .",
    "the appearance of @xmath77 in the scaling relation for @xmath63 is also to be noted here .",
    "@xmath77 is the entanglement entropy of the system when no number fluctuations are allowed in the subsystem .",
    "thus it is a measure of all fluctuations other than number fluctuations .",
    "this seems to provide a scale in terms of which number fluctuations are to be measured .",
    "this also provides an intuitive reason for @xmath78 to capture the metal - insulator behaviour . by rescaling by @xmath77 to calculate @xmath78 we isolate the contribution of number fluctuations to the entanglement , which is the primary reason for conductivity of the system .",
    "when number fluctuations are not allowed , there can be spin flips preserving the number of particles in the subsystem . @xmath77",
    ", therefore captures these fluctuations , which are always present for any value of @xmath0 .",
    "changing @xmath0 does not affect these fluctuations and therefore the contribution to entanglement entropy from this is the same throughout .",
    "so @xmath77 appears as a multiplicative factor in the expression for entanglement entropy .",
    "with change in @xmath0 , only the central charge @xmath78 changes .",
    "even when there is no number fluctuation in the subsystem , there can be spin fluctuations in the subsystem .",
    "spin fluctuations come in two kinds : fluctuations related to spins of same kind ( @xmath79 ) , and fluctuations related to spins of different kind ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "but these two are related to number fluctuations by the relation : @xmath81 , where , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are given as : @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the number of up and down spins in subsystem respectively .",
    "we want to know what bearing @xmath79 and @xmath80 have on @xmath78 .",
    "since in @xmath78 , the contribution from the @xmath50 correlations is factored out , we look for the dependence of @xmath78 on @xmath85 and @xmath86 , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 at @xmath50 . by inspection",
    "it is seen that a very good data collapse is obtained when @xmath78 is plotted as a function of : @xmath89    the plots showing data collapse are given in fig [ e ] . at @xmath50 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and at @xmath49 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 .",
    "the plot of @xmath78 vs @xmath94 is bounded by these values for any @xmath1 .",
    "fig [ dedxx ] shows plot of derivative of @xmath78 vs @xmath94 .",
    "we see that the derivative is zero at @xmath92 but diverges to @xmath95 at @xmath90 .",
    "let us assume that @xmath78 can be described by a polynomial function @xmath96 .",
    "then the fact that the derivative diverges while the function itself is well defined at @xmath90 suggests there must be a term of the form @xmath97 with @xmath98 .",
    "the derivative is zero at @xmath92 .",
    "this means there must be a linear part in @xmath96 which , when differentiated , cancels the contribution of @xmath97 term in the derivative of @xmath96 at @xmath92 .",
    "let us assume the remaining terms in @xmath96 does not involve a constant term .",
    "then the fact that at @xmath92 , @xmath93 implies the coefficient of @xmath97 term is @xmath99 .",
    "then the coefficient of the linear part must be @xmath100 so as to make the derivative zero at @xmath92 .",
    "finally , let us assume that the remaining term in @xmath96 is of the form @xmath101 . since @xmath78 vs @xmath94 plot is decreasing and concave for all @xmath94 , @xmath102 . the fact that at @xmath90 , @xmath91 , then implies that the coefficient of @xmath101 term is @xmath103 .",
    "hence we have an equation of the form : @xmath104    when this equation is fitted with @xmath105 and @xmath106 as parameters , quite a good fit is obtained and the values come out to be @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",
    "the fits are also shown in fig [ ex ] and [ dedxx ] .",
    "the fractional values of @xmath105 and @xmath106 means that @xmath96 is only real in the range @xmath109 , which is exactly the accessible range in the present case .",
    "next we seek to consolidate eq [ f(x ) ] with our previous findings .",
    "we have found that eq [ e(y ) ] is valid for @xmath110 .",
    "this limit implies small values of @xmath0 .",
    "thus eq [ f(x ) ] must reproduce eq [ e(y ) ] as @xmath111 , i.e , as @xmath112 .",
    "the term in @xmath96 that varies most slowly with @xmath94 is @xmath113 .",
    "so , as @xmath112 , we have the following relation : @xmath114 where the last relation has been obtained by expanding eq [ e(y ) ] for small @xmath115 .",
    "thus , in this limit , : @xmath116 we have multiplied both sides by @xmath77 because @xmath66 is the variable of interest here .",
    "fig [ wy1 ] shows plots of @xmath117 vs @xmath66 .",
    "remarkably , there seems to be a data collapse for all values of @xmath66 , even though , based on eq [ w ] , we would have expected that to occur only for small @xmath66 .",
    "however , closer inspection shows that the data collapse is not good for the entire range of @xmath66 .",
    "it is good only for small @xmath66 , as expected .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that there is a near data collapse even for the part where the dependence is not approximately linear suggests that @xmath94 is not just a function of @xmath69 .",
    "there is an additional @xmath1 dependence coming through @xmath77 . since @xmath118",
    ", this in turn suggests that our initial choice of @xmath119 is not good for the entire range of values .",
    "it is only good for small @xmath69 , and is seen to hold for @xmath110 where eq [ e(y ) ] holds to a good approximation .",
    "our prediction about the metal - insulator crossover point holds in this region",
    ". only eq [ f(x ) ] , the equation relating central charge to spin fluctuations in subsystem , is valid for the entire range of @xmath0 .",
    "since we are working with one dimensional finite - size systems we are essentially dealing with nanochains . from the crossover behaviour of the entanglement entropy , we may infer that metal - insulator transitions can occur in nanochains . at half - filling",
    ", the crossover is marked by the scaling variable ( the location of the peak in fig.3 ) which combines the system size and the correlation factor , given by @xmath120 therefore , for a fixed finite size , the metal - insulator transition can occur at a finite value of @xmath121 .",
    "however , in the thermodynamic limit , it can occur only at @xmath50 , as is well known .",
    "conversely , a metal - insulator transition can also occur by changing the size of the system , for a fixed correlation factor .",
    "thus , both an interaction - induced , as well as a size - induced metal - insulator transition can be explained from our study of entanglement in the gutzwiller state .",
    "let us now see how eq.[crossover ] compares with the experiments and the known results .",
    "however , caution should be exercised in applying the above to real systems , as we are talking of a one - dimensional variational state in comparison with real three - dimensional materials . also",
    ", gutzwiller state is not applicable to every material .",
    "one material it has had considerable success explaining is ni . the gutzwiller state has been quite successful in explaining band structure from arpes results for ni @xcite .",
    "so we expect our results might be observable in ni nano - chains .",
    "ni has two possible ground state electron configurations with nearly same energy , i.e. @xmath1224s^23d^8}$ ] and @xmath1224s^13d^9}$ ] . in the spirit of hubbard s original paper @xcite , we look at the d - electrons only , even though we have assumed s - band electrons for mathematical ease . the second configuration of ni has one hole in the d - orbital . since at half - filling the hubbard model and the gutzwiller state are known to have particle hole symmetry , this case can be roughly thought of as a half - filled system .",
    "therefore , we expect the results at half - filling , that we discussed above , to hold for ni to some extent .    the on - site correlation factor @xmath0 is related to hubbard parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 through eq.[gu ] . for ni ,",
    "the bandwidth measurements have yielded the experimental value of @xmath38 , and the interaction strength @xmath39 has been obtained by fitting the theoretical results to band structure measurements .",
    "values of @xmath38 have been reported for various bands of ni@xcite . since",
    ", we are considering only d - electrons but have calculated assuming s - band electrons , we will consider the value of @xmath38 for @xmath123 band which retains the symmetry of the atomic s - orbital .",
    "also , @xmath123 band has been reported to have the greatest contribution to the to the 3d band width . for this case , the reported value of @xmath124 .",
    "the value of @xmath125 has been reported to reproduce the experimental 3d band width .",
    "therefore , within this approximation , we estimate @xmath126 for ni .",
    "we assume in this calculation that @xmath0 , and hence @xmath51 , is independent of system size .",
    "however , as dimension decreases , the value of @xmath38 which depends on the overlap of nearby orbitals is expected to remain almost the same , but the value of @xmath39 is expected to increase due to decrease in screening . thus in one dimension , the value of @xmath51 is expected to be lower than the above estimate .    in a recent experiment@xcite , ni nanochains of length @xmath127 have been fabricated and have been reported to be antiferromagnetic and insulating .",
    "typical lattice parameter for ni is @xmath128 .",
    "therefore , we can estimate the number of sites for these ni nanochains to be @xmath129 , thus our description of metal - insulator crossover holds . with this value of @xmath1 , combining eq.[crossover ] and eq.[gu ] gives a metal - insulator crossover value at @xmath126 which is exactly the value we got by rough estimation from known results in three dimensions .",
    "since in one dimension , the value is expected to be smaller than this value , the nanochain is expected to be insulating , as is experimentally seen .",
    "however , the estimation of @xmath51 from known three dimensional results was quite rough .",
    "hence , based on the above calculations , all that can be concluded is that eq.[gu ] gives at least ` in the ballpark ' results . even though this is only a rough approximation",
    ", such correspondence suggests that longer ni nano - chains will be pushed towards being metallic .",
    "if this trait is seen in experiments , it can be taken as verification of our results .",
    "this is more so because the exact solution of hubbard model in one dimension in thermodynamic limit predicts the opposite , viz .",
    "an insulating state .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the entanglement entropy and bipartite fluctuations for the gutzwiller state in one dimension , and the crossover behaviour at the metal - insulator transition in finite systems .",
    "we have shown that the entanglement entropy @xmath57 for the half filled gutzwiller state shows logarithmic divergence for all values of the correlation factor @xmath0 .",
    "this is because the correlation between same kind of spins always have an infinite correlation length , as we have shown by calculating correlation functions by variational monte carlo .",
    "only the coefficient of the logarithmic term varies with @xmath0 , capturing the effect of correlation between opposite spins which decreases with @xmath0 . in @xmath49 and @xmath50",
    "limits , the coefficient becomes the central charge of the underlying cft even for small system sizes @xmath1 . for intermediate values ,",
    "the coefficient is interpreted is central charge along with some finite size corrections , @xmath78 .",
    "plots of derivative of @xmath78 with @xmath0 show a peak which correspond to the value of @xmath0 where finite size corrections are maximum . based on correlation length arguments",
    ", this value of @xmath0 is interpreted as the insulator to metal crossover point .",
    "an approximate scaling relation for @xmath78 is found in terms of @xmath130 that does not hold for all values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , but describes the peak at least for small values of @xmath1 .",
    "this scaling relation depends on @xmath131 , where @xmath132 gives the discontinuity of the momentum distribution function at the fermi level . in terms of @xmath69 ,",
    "the insulator to metal crossover point is at @xmath133 .",
    "we have also found approximate scaling law for bipartite number fluctuations in half filled gutzwiller state , and from this result we have shown that @xmath134 gives the crossover point for @xmath135 .",
    "we have also found an expression for @xmath78 in terms of bipartite spin fluctuations .",
    "away from half - filling , in the non - interacting ( @xmath49 ) case entanglement still shows logarithmic divergence with central charge @xmath33 , showing metallic behaviour .",
    "however , the entanglement entropy decreases with a decrease in number density of electrons in the metallic limit . also , the effect of @xmath0 reduces",
    "this is attributed to the fact that the difference between the average double occupancy of non - interacting and strongly interacting limits decreases with a decrease in the number density .",
    "the entanglement entropy varies non - monotonically with the number density of electrons in the strongly - interacting limit .    from our semi - quantitative analysis of entanglement in gutzwiller state in one dimension",
    ", we find that the gutzwiller state at half - filling can show a metal - insulator transition at a finite value of the on - site correlation factor @xmath0 and for a finite size @xmath1 .",
    "our expression for the crossover point shows that both the interaction - induced and the size - induced metal - insulator transitions can be described by the gutzwiller state . finally , we have shown that our results show some correspondence with a recent experiment on ni nanochains .",
    "such correspondence predicts that longer ni nanochains will be pushed towards being metallic , which is in contrast with the exact solution of one dimensional hubbard model , which predicts an insulating state in the thermodynamic limit .",
