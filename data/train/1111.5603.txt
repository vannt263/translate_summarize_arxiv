    "the aim is to achieve this regime in the always - on interaction , such that the degenerate ground state of hamiltonian  ( [ kitaevspinh ] ) encodes the topologically protected subspace .",

    "in addition to state initialization , the adiabatic mapping can be also used to transfer an arbitrary qubit state that comes into the system , e.g. , a photonic qubit , to the mf qubit .",
    "one can begin with a photonic incoming state , @xmath74 , where @xmath75 , @xmath76 are fock states : by using a quantum interface with a cavity , state @xmath75 can be mapped to @xmath66 and @xmath76 to @xmath67 , by a collective excitation and an intermediate phonon state  @xcite .",
    "we point out that in order to get high fidelities in the coupling to the incoming photon , chains of around 20 ions at least should be employed  @xcite , though for the mf qubit itself , as we will show , 3 ions are enough . in this respect ,",
    "some experiments have already been realized  @xcite .",

    "[ fig1]a we show a scheme of the proposed setup .",
    "one can efficiently implement local operations upon the mf qubits . in general",
    ", these local operations upon the nonlocal mf qubits translate into nonlocal operations upon the physical qubits , i.e. , the trapped ions .",
    "the complete set of local operations , i.e. pauli matrices , upon the nonlocal mf qubit , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 , can be related to the single - ion pauli operators @xmath84 through the expressions @xmath85 as can be appreciated , @xmath86 are highly nonlocal operations upon the ions .",
    "nervertheless , they can be implemented efficiently with a reduced number of lasers as recently shown both theoretically  @xcite , and experimentally  @xcite , using sequences of mlmer - srensen and local gates .",
    "thus , with the proposed setup , we have a fully controllable majorana - fermion qubit",
    ".    the topological qubit readout can be also implemented . a projective measurement upon the basis @xmath87 , which is equivalent to detecting the parity operator @xmath88 , amounts to one local measurement of @xmath89 operator per ion .",
    "this is the easiest detection performed in trapped ions and can be done , with standard resonance fluorescence , with fidelities larger than 0.99  @xcite . combined with the local operations exposed above ,",
    "this allows one for the full tomographic reconstruction of the mf qubit .",
    "the proposed implementation , as has been shown above , contains a degenerate ground state , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , which is protected by a gap from higher - level excitations .",
    "a consequence of this is that local operations @xmath92 , which couple @xmath90 , @xmath91 with higher energy states , are topologically supressed .",
    "thus , magnetic field fluctuations along these directions will not have an effect upon the system . on the other hand ,",

    "( 3 ) is computed  @xcite , such that their contribution to decoherence will be negligible .",
    "this is because this spurious interaction is far off - resonant and will not induce transitions . for example , using a quadrupole transition between the two levels @xmath94 and @xmath95 of @xmath96ca@xmath97 , with an energy separation of about @xmath98thz , an x error of magnitude @xmath99 , e.g. around @xmath100hz , will rotate in the interaction picture , taking the form @xmath101 , resulting in an effective unintended excitation probability of about @xmath102 . in general this will also happen with the @xmath103-direction ambient magnetic fields , such that these will be doubly protected : by the topological hamiltonian and by the single - ion qubit energy transition .",

    "we remark that the presence of a nnn coupling does not affect the protocol for a three - ion setup .",

    "we point out that , in the long time limit , other sources of error will dominate on the decoherence of the system .",
