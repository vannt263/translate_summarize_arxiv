    "the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) is a model of driven diffusive particles on a lattice with hard - core exclusion ( for general review see spohn 1991 ) .",
    "the asep appears as a minimal building block in a large variety of models for hopping conductivity ( richards 1977 ) , polymer reptation ( widom _ et al .",
    "_ 1991 ) , traffic flow ( schreckenberg and wolf 1998 ) or surface growth ( krug 1997 ) . in particular , the asep in one dimension is a discrete version of the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation ( halpin - healy and zhang 1995 ) . in biophysics , the asep has been used to describe the diffusion of macromolecules through narrow vessels ( levitt 1973 ) and the kinetics of protein synthesis on rna ( macdonald and gibbs 1969 ) ; more recently , a mapping between sequence - alignment and the exclusion process has been proposed ( bundschuh 2002 ) . from a theoretical point of view , the asep plays the role of a paradigm in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics : it displays a variety of features such as boundary induced phase transitions ( krug 1991 ) , spontaneous symmetry breaking in one dimension ( evans _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) and dynamical phase separation ( evans _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) .",
    "exact results for the asep in one dimension have been derived using two complementary approaches ( for a review see derrida 1998 ) .",
    "the matrix ansatz ( derrida _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ) allows to calculate steady state properties such as invariant measures ( speer 1993 ) , current fluctuations in the stationary state and large deviation functionals ( derrida _ et al .",
    "_ 2003 ) . the bethe ansatz ( dhar 1987 ) provides spectral information about the evolution ( markov ) operator ( gwa and spohn 1992 ; schtz 1993 ; kim 1995 ) which can be used to derive large deviation functions ( derrida and lebowitz 1998 ; derrida and appert 1999 ; derrida and evans 1999 ) .",
    "the exact relation between these two techniques is still a matter of investigation ( alcaraz _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ; stinchcombe and schtz 1995 ; alcaraz and lazo 2003 ) .",
    "the relaxation time to the stationary state for the asep on a lattice of size @xmath0 scales typically as a power law , @xmath1 , @xmath2 being the asep dynamical exponent .",
    "the calculation of @xmath2 for a one dimensional system by bethe ansatz is an important exact result that was first announced by dhar , who found @xmath3 ( dhar 1987 ) . the spectral gap ( and thus @xmath2 ) was subsequently calculated for the half - filling case by gwa and spohn ( 1992 ) and for an arbitrary density by kim ( 1995 ) who mapped the asep into a non - hermitian xxz heisenberg spin chain .",
    "the one - dimensional asep belongs to the kpz universality class and therefore the kpz dynamical exponent in one dimension is equal to 3/2 ; this result was previously deduced from galilean invariance and renormalization group arguments ( for a review see krug 1997 ) .    in this work ,",
    "we present a new method of calculating the spectral gap of the totally asymmetric exclusion process ( tasep ) starting from the bethe ansatz equations .",
    "our method , based on an analytic continuation formula , circumvents the technical difficulties involved in the derivation of gwa and spohn ( 1992 ) and renders the calculation of the asep dynamical exponent much more concise and transparent . besides",
    ", our technique can be readily extended to the arbitrary density case and allows us to calculate the spectral gap for the asymmetric exclusion process with a tagged particle .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2 , we recall the definition of the tasep , present the bethe ansatz equations without deriving them and summarize their analysis . in section 3 ,",
    "we present our original calculation of the spectral gap in the half - filling case .",
    "concluding remarks and generalizations of our method are given in section  4 .",
    "we consider the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process on a periodic one dimensional lattice with @xmath0 sites ( sites @xmath4 and @xmath5 are identical ) . in this model ,",
    "the total number @xmath6 of particles is conserved .",
    "each lattice site @xmath4 ( @xmath7 ) is either occupied by one particle or is empty ( _ exclusion rule _ ) .",
    "stochastic dynamical rules govern the evolution of the system : a particle on a site @xmath4 at time @xmath8 jumps , in the interval between times @xmath8 and @xmath9 , with probability @xmath10 to the neighbouring site @xmath11 if this site is empty .",
    "the total number of configurations for @xmath6 particles on a ring with @xmath0 sites is given by @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "in the stationary state , all configurations have the same probability @xmath13 ( derrida 1998 ) .",
    "a configuration can be characterized by the positions of the @xmath6 particles on the ring , @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "we call @xmath16 the probability of this configuration at time @xmath8 ; the probability distribution @xmath17 of the system at time @xmath8 is thus a @xmath18-dimensional vector . as the asep is a continuous - time markov ( _ i.e. _ , memoryless ) process , the time evolution of @xmath17 is determined by the master equation @xmath19 where the transition rate @xmath20 matrix @xmath21 is the markov matrix",
    ". a right eigenvector @xmath22 is associated with the eigenvalue @xmath23 of @xmath21 if @xmath24 the markov matrix @xmath21 is a real non - symmetric matrix and , therefore , its eigenvalues ( and eigenvectors ) are either real numbers or complex conjugate pairs .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath21 contains the eigenvalue @xmath25 and the associated right eigenvector is the stationary state @xmath26 . because the dynamics is ergodic ( _ i.e. _",
    ", @xmath21 is an irreducible and aperiodic markov matrix ) , the perron - frobenius theorem implies that all eigenvalues @xmath23 except @xmath27 have a strictly negative real part ; the relaxation time of the corresponding eigenmode is @xmath28 .",
    "( the imaginary part of @xmath23 gives rise to an oscillatory behaviour ) .    in this paper",
    ", we shall calculate the gap @xmath29 , _ i.e. _ , the non - zero eigenvalue of @xmath21 with largest real part .",
    "the eigenmode associated with @xmath29 has thus the longest relaxation time that scales as @xmath1 , @xmath2 being the dynamical exponent .",
    "writing @xmath21 explicitly , the eigenvalue equation  ( [ eq : mpsi = epsi ] ) becomes @xmath30 \\ , , \\ ] ] where the sum runs over the indexes @xmath4 such that @xmath31 , _",
    "i.e. _ , such that the corresponding jump is allowed .",
    "the _ bethe ansatz _ assumes that the eigenvectors @xmath22 can be written in the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the group of the @xmath34 permutations of @xmath6 indexes .",
    "the coefficients @xmath35 and the fugacities @xmath36 are complex numbers to be determined .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath23 associated with an eigenvector of the form  ( [ eq : ba ] ) is given by @xmath37 using matching conditions at the boundary surfaces @xmath38 and the periodicity of the lattice , it can be shown that a vector @xmath22 of the type  ( [ eq : ba ] ) is an eigenvector of @xmath21 if the fugacities @xmath39 satisfy the _ bethe equations _",
    "@xmath40 the procedure for deriving these equations has been thoroughly explained in halpin - healy and zhang ( 1995 ) and derrida ( 1998 ) .    the obvious solution @xmath41 provides the stationary distribution with eigenvalue @xmath27 . more generally , given a solution @xmath39 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : be ] ) , the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath23 is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : e ] ) ; moreover , the coefficients @xmath35 and thus the eigenvector @xmath22 are uniquely determined . in order to have a complete basis of eigenvectors , @xmath18 independent solutions of the bethe equations  ( [ eq : be ] ) are needed .",
    "following gwa and spohn ( 1992 ) , we introduce @xmath42 .",
    "the equations  ( [ eq : e ] ) and ( [ eq : be ] ) then become , respectively , @xmath43 and @xmath44 we notice that the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bez ] ) is a polynomial in @xmath45 whereas the right hand side ( r.h.s . )",
    "is independent of the index @xmath4 .",
    "the analysis of the bethe equations is simplified if only half - filled models are considered , that is , if @xmath46 ( gwa and spohn 1992 ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : bez ] ) then reduces to @xmath47 the half - filling restriction does not affect the physical behaviour of the asep : in the large @xmath0 limit , models with arbitrary density , @xmath480,1[$ ] , belong to the same universality class .",
    "however , systems with vanishingly small density of particles ( @xmath49 ) or holes ( @xmath50 ) exhibit a different behaviour and will not be discussed here .",
    "taking advantage of the fact that the r.h.s .",
    "( [ eq : behf ] ) is independent of the index @xmath4 , the bethe equations can be reformulated as follows . consider the polynomial equation @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a given complex number .",

    "( [ eq : ez ] ) .    for small values of @xmath6 , the above described procedure allows us to compute numerical solutions of the bethe equations . from our numerical observations ,",

    "( [ eq : ay = y ] ) has a unique solution @xmath52 that yields one eigenvector @xmath79 and one eigenvalue @xmath78 .",
    "this suggests that the bethe equations yield a complete basis of eigenvectors for the asep .",

    "numerical observations ( gwa and spohn 1992 ) indicate that the first excited eigenvalue @xmath29 corresponds to the choice @xmath80 for @xmath88 and @xmath89 ; _ i.e. _ , the first excited state is obtained from the ground state by the _ excitation _ @xmath90 .",
    "writing @xmath91 and @xmath29 for the functions @xmath74 and @xmath78 corresponding to this choice function , we have , from eqs .",

    "( [ eq : a1 ] )  and  ( [ eq : e1e0 ] ) and thus to the same eigenvalue @xmath29 .",
    "the first excited state has therefore a degeneracy of order 2 .",
    "consequently , in order to find the expression for the gap @xmath29 , we must solve the self - consistency equation @xmath98 calculate the @xmath81 s for @xmath99 and finally deduce @xmath29 from eq .",

    "gwa and spohn ( 1992 ) , on the contrary , first represent the analytic continuation of the bethe equations for a fixed value of @xmath6 as a @xmath6-dependent complex integral ( thanks to the euler - maclaurin formula ) and then extract the gap from the large @xmath6 limit of this integral representation which is rather a delicate operation . we have shown here that the derivation of the tasep gap is greatly simplified by performing the calculations in the reverse order , that is taking the large  @xmath6 limit first and the analytic continuation afterwards .    we do not claim that it is always true that large @xmath6 limit and analytic continuation are commuting operations . if the solution @xmath52 of eq .",

    "we have applied our method to several other problems but , for sake of conciseness , we simply list these additional calculations without giving the details . our technique provides the subleading corrections to the gap and allows us to calculate the eigenvalue of the highest excited state , of a finite excitation above the ground state , or below the highest excited state .",
    "the gap for the totally asymmetric exclusion process with an arbitrary density @xmath133 can also be obtained by elementary means , and we find in agreement with ( kim 1995 ) @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the gap for the half - filling case given in eq .",
