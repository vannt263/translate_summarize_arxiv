    "<S> the main objective of this work is to explore the evolution in the structure of the quark - antiquark bound states in going down in the chirally restored phase from the so - called  zero binding points \" @xmath0 to the qcd critical temperature @xmath1 at which the nambu - goldstone and wigner - weyl modes meet . in doing this , we adopt the idea recently introduced by shuryak and zahed for charmed @xmath2 , light - quark @xmath3 mesons @xmath4 and gluons that at @xmath0 , the quark - antiquark scattering length goes through @xmath5 at which conformal invariance is restored , thereby transforming the matter into a near perfect fluid behaving hydrodynamically , as found at rhic . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the binding of these states is accomplished by the combination of ( i ) the color coulomb interaction , ( ii ) the relativistic effects , and ( iii ) the interaction induced by the instanton - anti - instanton molecules . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - spin forces turned out to be small . while near @xmath0 all mesons are large - size nonrelativistic objects bound by coulomb attraction , near @xmath1 they get much more tightly bound , with many - body collective interactions becoming important and making the @xmath6 and @xmath7 masses approach zero ( in the chiral limit ) . </S>",
    "<S> the wave function at the origin grows strongly with binding , and the near - local four - fermi interactions induced by the instanton molecules play an increasingly more important role as the temperature moves downward toward @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> the concept that hadronic states may survive in the high temperature phase of qcd , the quark - gluon plasma @xcite , has been known for some time . in particular , it was explored by brown et al.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of ( degenerate ) @xmath7 and @xmath6 resonances above @xmath1 in the context of the njl model was discussed earlier by hatsuda and kunihiro@xcite , and in the instanton liquid model by schafer and shuryak @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , lattice calculations @xcite have shown that , contrary to the original suggestion by matsui and satz @xcite , the lowest charmonium states @xmath8 remain bound well above @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> . the estimates of the zero binding temperature for charmonium @xmath9 is now limited to the interval @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is that for quenched qcd . </S>",
    "<S> similar results for light quark mesons exist but are less quantitative at the moment . </S>",
    "<S> however since the  quasiparticle \" masses close to @xmath1 are large , they must be similar to those for charmonium states .    </S>",
    "<S> in the chiral limit all states above the chiral restoration go into chiral multiplets . for quark quasiparticles </S>",
    "<S> this is also true , but although the chirality is conserved during their propagation , they are not massless and move slowly near @xmath1 where their `` chiral mass '' @xmath12 is large ( @xmath13 gev ) .    </S>",
    "<S> rhic experiments have found that hot / dense matter at temperatures above the critical value @xmath14 is @xmath15 a weakly interacting gas of quasiparticles , as was widely expected . instead , rhic data have demonstrated the existence of very robust collective flow phenomena , well described by ideal hydrodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> most decisive in reaching this conclusion was the early measurement of the elliptic flow which showed that equilibration in the new state of matter above @xmath1 set in in a time @xmath16 fm / c @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the first viscosity estimates @xcite show surprisingly low values , suggesting that this matter is the most perfect liquid known . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of shear viscosity coefficient to the entropy is only @xmath17 , two orders of magnitude less than for water . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is comparable to predictions in the infinite coupling limit ( for @xmath18=4 susy ym theory ) @xmath19 @xcite , perhaps the lowest value possible .    </S>",
    "<S> shuryak and zahed@xcite have recently connected these two issues together . they have suggested that large rescattering cross sections apparently present in hot matter at rhic are generated by resonances near the zero - binding lines . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , at the point of zero binding the scattering length @xmath20 of the two constituents goes to @xmath5 and this provides low viscosity . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon is analogous to the elliptic flow observed in the expansion of trapped @xmath21li atoms rendered possible by tuning the scattering length to very large values via a feshbach resonance  @xcite .    near the zero - binding points , </S>",
    "<S> to be denoted by @xmath0 , introduced by shuryak and zahed@xcite the binding is small and thus the description of the system can be simple and nonrelativistic . the binding comes about chiefly from the attractive coulomb color electric field , as evidenced in lattice gauge calculation of karsch and collaborators@xcite , and asakawa and hatsuda@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the instanton molecule interactions are less important at these high temperatures ( @xmath22 mev ) .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we wish to construct the link between the chirally broken state of hadronic matter below @xmath1 and the chirally restored mesonic , glueball state above @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> our objective is to understand and to work out in detail what exactly happens with hadronic states at temperatures between @xmath1 and @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> one important new point is that these chirally restored hadrons are so small that the color charges are locked into the hadrons at such short distances ( @xmath23 fm ) that the debye screening is unimportant . </S>",
    "<S> this is strictly true at @xmath24 , where there is very little free charge . in this temperature range the nonrelativistic treatment of shuryak and zahed@xcite </S>",
    "<S> should be changed to a relativistic one .    </S>",
    "<S> the relativistic current - current interaction , ultimately related with the classical ampere law , is about as important as the coulomb one , effectively doubling the attraction . </S>",
    "<S> we also found that the spin - spin forces @xcite are truly negligible . in effect , with the help of the instanton molecule interaction , one can get the bound quark - antiquark states down in energy , reaching the massless @xmath6 and @xmath7 at @xmath1 , so that a smooth transition can be made with the chiral breaking at @xmath25 .    the non - pertubative interaction from the instanton molecules becomes very important . </S>",
    "<S> let us remind the reader of the history of the issue . </S>",
    "<S> the nonperturbative gluon condensate , contributing to the dilatational charge or trace of the stress tensor @xmath26 , is not melted at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact more than half of the vacuum gluon condensate value remains at @xmath27 right above @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the hard glue or epoxy which explicitly breaks scale invariance but is unconnected with hadronic masses . </S>",
    "<S> the rate at which the epoxy is melted can be measured by lattice gauge simulations , and this tells us the rate at which the instanton molecules are broken up with increasing temperature .    as argued by ilgenfritz and shuryak @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon can be explained by breaking of the instanton ensemble into instanton molecules with zero topological charge . </S>",
    "<S> such molecules generate a new form of effective multi - fermion effective interaction similar to the orignal njl model@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> brown et al.@xcite obtained the interaction induced by the instanton molecules above @xmath1 by continuing the nambu - jona - lasinio description from below @xmath1 upwards .    </S>",
    "<S> our present discussion of mesonic bound states should not be confused with quasi - hadronic states found in early lattice calculations@xcite for quarks and antiquarks propagating in the space - like direction . </S>",
    "<S> their spectrum , known as `` screening masses '' is generated mostly by  dynamical confinement \" of the spatial wilson loop which is a nonperturbative phenomenon seen via the lattice calculations . </S>",
    "<S> similar effects will be given here by the instanton molecule interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> in this work we are able to construct a smooth transition from the chirally broken to the chirally restored sector in terms of continuity in the masses of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 mesons , vanishing at @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the crucial part of strong binding in our picture of @xmath3 mesons ( or molecules ) is the quasi - local interaction due to instanton molecules ( the `` hard glue '' ) . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the tight binding of these mesons near @xmath1 enhences the wave function at the origin , and gives us additional understanding of the nonperturbative hard glue ( epoxy ) which is preserved at @xmath29 .    in our nambu - jona lasinio formalism </S>",
    "<S> we construct giant collective vibrations with an essentially su(4 ) structure . </S>",
    "<S> there giant vibrations were found in lattice calculations by by asakawa et al.@xcite at two temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the lower temperature was in the region of the shuryak - zahed @xmath0 , and confirmed that the binding energy was very small . </S>",
    "<S> the higher temperature was at @xmath30 mev , above those reached by rhic , and the lattice calculations suggested perturbative quasiparticles , indicating production of the qgp at this temperature .    </S>",
