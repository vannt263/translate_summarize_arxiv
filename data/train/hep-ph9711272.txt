    "<S> the momentum distribution for the @xmath0 meson produced through the inclusive decay @xmath1 is investigated under two decay mechanisms , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> although all these two mechanisms can explain the recently observed decay rate of @xmath1 , the momentum spectrums for @xmath0 meson predicted by them are strongly different . </S>",
    "<S> thus detailed experiment is proposed to distinguish the two cases .    </S>",
    "<S> epsf 1.cm 1.cm    pacs numbers : 13.25.hw , 13.40.hq    0.3 in    recently more attention has been focused on the inclusive and exclusive decay mode of b mesons , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which have been observed with relatively large decay rates @xcite , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , under the constraint : @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> many authors have made efforts to explain these conspicuously large decay rates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism via the intermediate formation of a @xmath9 pair to form the final state containing an @xmath0 meson is too weak to explain the observed large decay rate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> besides , there are also mechanisms based on two - boby decay of b - quark @xmath10@xcite and three - body decay @xmath11@xcite . in the two - body decay mechanism </S>",
    "<S> , the b - quark decays into s - quark under gluon emission , where the gluon is either on - shell or off - shell , then the gluon transformates into @xmath0 meson due to the anomalously large coupling of @xmath0-gluon system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is a highly non - perturbative process . while in the three - body decay mechanism </S>",
    "<S> , the process proceeds via @xmath12 with @xmath13 transfers into @xmath14 and @xmath0 because of the anomalously large @xmath15 coupling@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all these two mechanisms can explain the experimental results with suitable coupling constant of @xmath0 and gluon field .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we want to study the momentum distribution of @xmath0 meson based on the two - body and three - body decay mechanisms @xmath10 and @xmath11 . by comparing the momentum distributions of @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , the two mechanisms can be distinguished in experiment if the momentum spectrum of @xmath0 is measured .    </S>",
    "<S> for the two - body decay mechanism , fritzsch has given an ansatz for the effective interaction between the quarks and the gluonic densities@xcite , @xmath16 where the const . </S>",
    "<S> includes the highly non - perturbative contributions of the strong interactions involved in the decay process . using the factorization method the amplitudes of @xmath17 can be calculated , @xmath18 where @xmath19 . here </S>",
    "<S> no attempt is made to calculate @xmath20 , because of its strong non - perturbative origin , but to fit the experimental data to get it . with eq.(2 ) , the decay width is obtained , @xmath21 where @xmath22       ^{1/2}$ ] .    to get the momentum distribution the fermi motion of the spectator quark inside the b meson should be taken into account . in this work </S>",
    "<S> the fermi motion is considered using the same method in accmm model@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spectator quark inside the meson is handled as an on - shell particle , and is attributed with a fermi motion . </S>",
    "<S> thus the spectator quark has definite mass @xmath23 and its momentum is @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the b quark is considered to be off - shell , its virtual mass @xmath25 can be given in the restframe of the b meson due to the four - momentum conservation as @xmath26 the momentum distribution probability of the fermi motion @xmath27 is introduced with a gaussian behaviour in the accmm model , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the normalizing constant under the normalization @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the free parameter @xmath31 is taken to be @xmath32 , which has been used to explain the momentum spectrum of @xmath33 in @xmath34 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the decay width of b quark should be transformed from the b quark restframe to the b meson restframe with a lorentz boost , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is expressed in eq.(3 ) with @xmath37 be substituted with @xmath25 , and @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 are the energy and momentum of @xmath0 meson in the restframe of b quark , respectively . to compare the momentum distribution with experiment </S>",
    "<S> , one has to transform eq.(6 ) into the laboratory frame where the b meson is in flight . </S>",
    "<S> because the b mesons are produced through the cascade process @xmath41 , they move with a momentum @xmath42 . performing the lorantz boost to the laboratory frame , the differential branching ratio for a b meson in flight is , @xmath43 where @xmath44^{1/2}$ ] , and @xmath45 @xmath46 is the maximum value of @xmath0 momentum in the restframe of b meson .    </S>",
    "<S> the numerical result is shown by the solid curve of fig.1 . </S>",
    "<S> the discussion is given in the end part of the paper .    </S>",
    "<S> = 5 in    .    </S>",
    "<S> now we turn to the three - body decay mechanism @xmath11 , for the detail of which the readers are referred to ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the loop induced @xmath47 current in the standard model is @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the feynman rule for the @xmath52 vertex is @xcite , @xmath53 here @xmath54 is the effective gluon anomaly coupling . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath55 is the polization of the gluon field , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the four - momentum of the two gluons .    </S>",
    "<S> define @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 is the four - momentum of all the inclusive hadranic products except @xmath0 meson . the differential branching ratio is @xmath63    \\frac{2 m_b p_{\\eta'}}{e_{\\eta ' } } , \\eqno(11)\\ ] ] with @xmath64/2 $ ] , @xmath65 , and @xmath66/2y^2 $ ] , @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 are consistent with these of ref.@xcite ( hou and tseng ) when taking the limit @xmath71 .    </S>",
    "<S> fot the numerical calculation , we take @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 which can ensure that the integrated branching ratio under the constraint @xmath75 is the center value of the experimental data . using eq.(7 ) to transform eq.(11 ) into the laboratory frame with b meson in flight , the result of the differential branching ratio </S>",
    "<S> is shown by the dashed curve of fig.1 .    </S>",
    "<S> fig.1 shows that in the three - body case ( dashed curve ) , the momentum distribution for @xmath0 meson is much broader than that in the two - body decay case ( the solid curve ) . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> most part of the curve lies lower than the cut used in the experiment @xmath76 @xmath77 . while in the @xmath2 case , no @xmath0 meson is found with momentum less than @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> the two mechanisms can be distinguished by experiment . </S>",
    "<S> thus more detailed experiment is needed . </S>"
