    "the gauge hierarchy problem is one of the driving theoretical reasons for the invention and necessity of new physics at the electroweak scale .",
    "its strength can be quantified as a technical naturalness problem induced by the instability of the electroweak scale under radiative corrections , which gains severity given the hierarchy of 16 orders of magnitude between the electroweak and the planck scale @xmath0 .",
    "models with compact extra dimensions explain this hierarchy in terms of geometry , and at the same time also the hierarchical structures observed in the fermionic masses and mixing angles via so - called geometrical sequestering @xcite .",
    "this can be achieved naturally within the framework of a warped extra dimension , first proposed by randall and sundrum ( rs ) @xcite .",
    "there one studies the standard model ( sm ) on a background consisting of minkowski space , embedded in a slice of five - dimensional anti de - sitter geometry ( @xmath1 ) with curvature @xmath2 .",
    "the fifth dimension is an @xmath3 orbifold of size @xmath4 , and has two branes located at orbifold fixed points , the uv and the ir brane .",
    "the geometry is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is called the warp factor . for @xmath7 the exponential contraction of length scales along the extra dimension mediates between a physical scale @xmath8 and a fundamental scale @xmath9 .",
    "we use the common setup of allowing the gauge and matter fields to spread in the @xmath1 bulk .",
    "this sm - like 5d gauge theory is the minimal setup from the dual conformal field theory point of view , as it implies that only the higgs is a total tev - scale composite of the strongly interacting sector , while sm gauge fields are fundamental and sm fermions are mostly fundamental with small mixing to the conformal sector @xcite .",
    "pragmatically thought , we only protect the scalar mass , leaving masses of higher - spin fundamentals to be protected by chiral or gauge symmetries .",
    "fermions in the bulk admit a natural explanation of the flavor structure of the sm @xcite .",
    "we achieve this by exponential localization of the fermion zero modes , which are the lowest mass harmonics of the 5d fermions .",
    "they receive their physical mass only from effective yukawa couplings , resulting from their wave - function overlap with a higgs boson .",
    "the latter is confined very close to the ir brane , where we may use the limit of complete localization for simplicity .",
    "the fermionic ir brane value @xmath10 is exponentially suppressed by the volume factor @xmath11 , if the normalized bulk mass parameters @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are smaller than a critical value @xmath14 . otherwise @xmath10 is of order one . here",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the masses of the five - dimensional @xmath17 doublet and singlet fermions .",
    "the exponential hierarchies are used to generate a hierarchical yukawa matrix out of anarchical @xmath18 fundamental yukawa coupling @xmath19    the model features a plethora of higher harmonics above the tev scale , the kk excitations of gauge bosons starting at @xmath20 , graviton @xmath21 , etc .",
    "each followed by an infinite tower of states , and additional mixings with the sm fields . yet",
    "it is determined by a rather small set of new parameters @xcite , _",
    "e.g. _  in the quark sector we have @xmath22 additional moduli and @xmath23 phases . moreover , explaining the sm fermion spectrum constrains all ratios of the values @xmath10 .",
    "e.g. in the quark sector @xcite , up to @xmath18 factors @xmath24 leading to the numerical distribution shown in figure [ fig : c_distribution ] , where we used exact formulas @xcite .",
    "distribution of bulk masses for @xmath25 $ ] tev , @xmath26 , and flat @xmath27 prior.,width=566 ]    thus the model has well testable predictions , which could be observed in future measurements , yet we have to assure conformity with existing measurements .",
    "most prominently , the compliance with electroweak precision data tightly restricts the minimal model to @xmath28 tev at 99% cl @xcite .",
    "there exist several ways to relax this constraint , like a possible high higgs mass of about @xmath29  tev , which would be natural in this model and cancels the model - dependent contribution to the @xmath30 parameter , leading to a lower bound @xmath31 tev . also restricting the model to warp only up to an intermediate and safe uv scale can help to lower the bound ( see @xcite for restrictions of this approach ) . alternatively one can make use of the custodial @xmath32 symmetry of the higgs sector , by extending the bulk hypercharge group to @xmath33 , breaking it to @xmath34 on the uv brane by specific orbifold boundary conditions @xcite . the higgs mechanism on the ir brane may safely break @xmath35 to the diagonal @xmath36 subgroup .",
    "this suppresses tree level contributions to @xmath30 by three orders of magnitude and implies @xmath37 tev , which can even be lowered further by calculable fermionic loop contributions to @xmath30 .",
    "typically tend to give a negative contribution to @xmath30 , which would even raise the bound @xcite . ]",
    "a discrete left - right parity symmetry and specifically chosen fermion representations @xcite furthermore relax constraints from the precisely measured @xmath38 vertex allowing for a wide range of right handed bottom and left handed top / bottom bulk masses , even for a low new physics scale .",
    "it is well known that strong constraints on the parameter space of new physics models can also arise from flavor observables .",
    "depending on the flavor structure and the first quantum order of flavor changing neutral currents , this translates into a bound on the new physics scale , and might result in a tension to the resolution of the hierarchy problem .",
    "this is the so called flavor puzzle , which is partly addressed in the rs model in the way fermion hierarchies are generated .",
    "the mechanism is referred to as the rs - gim and we show its numerical implications below .    given the relatively high bounds on the scale @xmath39 and consequently on new particles , we consider it worthwhile to present possibilities which might indirectly allow for detection or exclusion of a warped extra dimension .",
    "we start at the high luminosity frontier with effects on flavor observables , emphasizing the most prominent bound coming from indirect cp violation ( cpv ) in @xmath40@xmath41 transitions .",
    "we show that also direct cpv provides an effective constraint on some rare decays and discuss selected correlations , based on the exhaustive survey @xcite . at the high energy frontier we present a recent full one - loop calculation of the effect in higgs production and",
    "decays @xcite , which shows in strong shifts in the feasibility of higgs searching strategies .",
    "since the rs - gim mechanism implies flavor dependent couplings ordered with the fermion masses , it is most reasonable to expect changes in top couplings .",
    "this could affect for instance the forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath42 production , for which the measurement by cdf has very recently been affirmed @xcite , and a significant deviation from the nlo qcd prediction in the high invariant mass region has been found .",
    "however one must carefully account for the explanation of the flavor structure .",
    "the latter renders the leading - order axial - vector couplings to the kk - gluon dominated contributions far too small to explain the discrepancy , and also the interference of vector couplings with the one - loop sm diagrams is outweighed by the leading - order contribution to the symmetric cross section @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "another coupling of the top quark , namely to a higgs boson and a charm quark , receives enhanced importance @xcite for which we show numerics to round off this presentation .",
    "indirect cpv in @xmath44 decays has an outstanding constraining power in many extensions of the sm .",
    "it is induced by @xmath45 transition and the most recent theoretical determination of the imaginary value of the corresponding transition amplitude is given by @xmath46 @xcite . in the effective - theory parametrization @xmath47 helicity structures beyond the @xmath48 couplings of charged sm currents can contribute to the amplitude .",
    "most importantly @xmath49 , can be generated by the exchange of new colored particles .",
    "its coefficient enters the approximate formula for the @xmath40@xmath50 mixing amplitude @xmath51 we observe that @xmath52 has a large coefficient , which originates from the chiral enhancement of the hadronic matrix elements , and the rg evolution down to @xmath53 .",
    "thus the strongest contribution comes from kk - gluon exchange @xcite .",
    "the rs - gim is at work , as each fermion attached to a flavor violating vertex contributes approximately a factor of its ir brane value @xmath10 leading to @xmath54 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : epsk ] we observe that the median value of @xmath55 is consistent with the measurement only for @xmath56 tev .",
    "however the @xmath57 quantile crosses the experimentally allowed range already at about @xmath58 tev .",
    "the slow decoupling therefore introduces a moderate amount of arbitrariness in the definition of a bound on the new physics scale inferred from this observable , and it is important to be aware of the different quality compared to the aforementioned bounds from electroweak precision observables",
    ".     prediction for @xmath55 in the setup with minimal field content .",
    "all points reproduce the observed fermion spectrum , and ckm matrix , are not excessively fine - tuned , and have perturbative yukawa couplings up to the @xmath59 kk - level .",
    "points colored blue are consistent with @xmath60 at the 99% cl , and orange points fall inside the experimental 95% cl of @xmath55 combined with the theory error .",
    "the cyan lines illustrate the decoupling behavior obtained from a fit to the @xmath57 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 quantile.,width=264 ]    one possibility to protect @xmath55 from excessive corrections is to arrange for common bulk mass parameters in the sector of the right - handed down - type quarks @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we showed that the typical suppression of @xmath52 amounts to a factor of @xmath63 and discuss a few other resolutions .",
    "impact of the @xmath64 constraint on @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "all points reproduce the quark masses and mixings , and the measured value of @xmath55 , observables in @xmath67 , and @xmath68@xmath69 mixing .",
    "the blue points are consistent with the measured value of @xmath70 after varying the hadronic parameters . for details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the black cross indicates the sm point , the light gray shaded area shows the region excluded by isospin conservation of qcd , and the yellow band displays the experimental 68% cl range .",
    ", width=264 ]    the hadronic uncertainties involved in direct cpv in @xmath71 are larger compared to those in @xmath72 .",
    "yet it turns out to be useful to look at @xmath70 , which describes the ratio of direct over indirect cpv in this decay and is defined in terms of ratios of @xmath73 and @xmath74 transitions @xmath75 taking into account the sm wilson coefficients and the renormalization - group evolution from @xmath76 to @xmath77 @xcite we observe that contributions to the qcd penguin and the electroweak penguin @xmath78 play the dominant role @xcite .",
    "indeed , both qcd and electroweak penguin contributions generated at a high scale are strongly enhanced by the rg evolution from @xmath76 down to @xmath77 . however , qcd corrections mainly result from the mixing of @xmath79 with current - current operators @xmath80 , and are therefore mostly unaffected by the given high - scale physics . concerning the electroweak side , in the rs model only contributions to the color - singlet operator @xmath81",
    "arise at the scale @xmath82 , but they are directly fed via operator mixing into @xmath83 at the scale @xmath76 .",
    "therefore @xmath70 in rs is mainly influenced by the electroweak penguin , similar to the decays @xmath84 where they are the only contributions .",
    "for those very decays of charged and neutral kaons the sm amplitude is tiny , both because of the @xmath85 suppression induced by the ckm structure , and the gim mechanism @xcite .",
    "the necessary low energy matrix elements for the decays are related to precisely measured semileptonic tree - level decays @xmath86 .",
    "therefore they offer a very clean test of physics beyond the sm from the theoretical perspective @xcite , but are likewise challenging to measure .",
    "fortunately two experiments aim to perform measurements with an anticipated accuracy of @xmath87 , namely na62 ( cern ) for the charged mode and koto ( j - parc ) for the neutral mode .    in figure",
    "[ fig : kpinunu_with_epseps ] we observe that the rs and sm amplitudes are comparable in size . indeed , the factors @xmath88 associated with the flavor - violating rs vertex account for approximately the same suppression of @xmath89 as in the ckm structure of the sm vertex .",
    "moreover , the relevant rs corrections to the left - handed @xmath90 amplitude have a free phase , in contrast to the small phase in the sm . since the cp violating neutral mode is proportional to the imaginary part of the contributions",
    ", we see that it could in principle obtain large relative corrections , which are however excluded by the following argument .",
    "the typical ratio of rs over sm contributions in @xmath70 is even a factor of @xmath91 larger than in @xmath92 case .",
    "the reason is well known : the qcd and electroweak penguins cancel in the sm to a large extent , so the value of @xmath70 is accidentally small .",
    "this entails an effective constraint .",
    "the rs amplitude adds linearly and with opposite sign to the sm contribution in @xmath70 , and quadratically with the same sign in @xmath93 .",
    "as the central value of theory prediction for @xmath70 is below the experimental one , large enhancements of @xmath94 are disfavored already with a conservative treatment of hadronic errors .",
    "a lattice determination of the hadronic matrix elements of @xmath95 , taking into account the full final state , is in progress @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that this would be most welcome in view of the constraining potential .",
    "to briefly show one of the many correlations in the @xmath96-meson sector , we select here the decays @xmath97 \\ , { \\rm gev}^2}$ ] and @xmath98 given in figure [ fig : bxsll ] .",
    "correlation of the prediction for @xmath99 versus @xmath100 in the setup with minimal field content .",
    "the blue points are consistent with the measured @xmath101 couplings at the 99% cl .",
    "the black cross indicates the sm expectation . for comparison the regions of 68% ( yellow ) and 95% ( orange ) cl",
    "are also displayed .",
    "furthermore the 95% cl exclusion of @xmath98 and the minimum branching fraction allowing for a discovery with @xmath102 at lhcb are indicated by the red band and dashed line.,width=264 ]    after imposing the @xmath103 constraint , enhancements in the purely leptonic mode imply values of @xmath104 \\ , { \\rm gev}^2}$ ] safely within the experimentally allowed range in most of the parameter space .",
    "this is expected in models where third generation couplings are most strongly modified @xcite .",
    "the anti - correlation can be understood by the fact that both modes receive the dominant contribution from axial vector couplings , which are aligned in flavor space , whereas the corresponding sm amplitudes have opposite sign in the two decays .",
    "leptonic @xmath96-meson decays belong to the channels that can be studied by three lhc experiments , atlas , cms , and lhcb .",
    "they will probe the branching fraction of @xmath105 down to its sm value and might reveal a signal of new physics well ahead of the direct searches .",
    "we conclude the discussion of flavor observables with a final remark on the changes that occur when the minimal bulk gauge symmetry is extended to a custodial symmetry with left - right parity as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the changes in the couplings have been worked out @xcite and the leading effects encoded in flavor - universal rescaling factors .",
    "custodial rs effects in @xmath106 ( and @xmath107 , @xmath108 ) couplings are reduced by @xmath109 , but at the same time increased by a factor of approximately @xmath23 in @xmath110 relative to the minimal rs model .",
    "effects in @xmath111 decays are therefore typically reduced if @xmath112 has a natural bulk mass , and large enhancements of @xmath113 like shown in figure [ fig : bxsll ] are impossible @xcite .",
    "the change of the chiral nature of the @xmath114 vertex remarkably inverts a correlation found between the branching ratios of @xmath115 and @xmath116 , but an identification of the chiral structure in this way would require major theoretical progress in the prediction of this radiative decay .",
    "similarly one can work out the relative coupling shifts for @xmath117 processes , which shows that @xmath118 exchange is modified by a factor of approximately @xmath119 in @xmath120 .",
    "although kk - gluon exchange is still dominant in @xmath40@xmath50 transitions , the @xmath118 can be competitive in @xmath121@xmath122 mixing .",
    "cross sections for the main higgs - boson production channels at the lhc for a center - of - mass energy of @xmath123 , and @xmath124 tev .",
    "the dominant channels are gluon - gluon ( red ) and weak gauge - boson fusion ( blue ) .",
    "the dashed lines illustrate the sm predictions , while the solid lines indicate the results obtained in the custodial rs model.,width=264 ]    an estimation of the impact of the rs model on higgs searches at hadron colliders involves first of all the production , where gluon fusion is the main channel . in the sm",
    ", the process receives the main contribution from a top - quark triangle loop .",
    "after factoring out numerical constants and @xmath125 its contribution is encoded in the form factor @xmath126 .",
    "a small correction arises from the bottom - quark , but since @xmath127 vanishes proportional to its argument the lighter quarks are irrelevant . in the rs model the amplitude for the top - triangle",
    "is always reduced but still positive .",
    "the origin lies in the modified @xmath128 coupling , which is strongly suppressed ( @xmath129 for @xmath130 tev ) because of the compositeness to the top , _",
    "i.e. _  its ir localization .",
    "analog to the top triangle all kk modes contribute in triangle diagrams .",
    "since @xmath131 in the limit of a very large quark mass , the total sum over all kk fermions appears at first sight to be divergent , as the mass splitting of the higher modes is asymptotically equidistant .",
    "however one can show that a delicate cancellation occurs at each kk level between the two chiralities of the vector - like fermion associated to each sm fermion @xcite . as a result the sum converges similar to a geometric series instead of diverging like a harmonic series .    our numerical analysis",
    "shown in figure [ fig : prodplots ] is based on a rescaling of the sm calculation @xcite .",
    "we find that the relevant amplitudes show only a small spread when scanning over the experimentally allowed rs parameter space .",
    "therefore we display only the median values .",
    "the higgs mass dependence can be easily understood . up to the @xmath132 threshold the form factor increases , but it decreases above .",
    "the kk - amplitude is negative and approaches a constant in the heavy higgs - mass limit . where it becomes dominant",
    ", the full amplitude flips sign , what shows up as a complete destructive interference in the cross section near the @xmath132 threshold .",
    "numerically the suppression at the lhc ranges between @xmath133 to @xmath134 depending on the higgs mass . at @xmath135",
    "tev the suppression is at most @xmath136 and at @xmath137 tev still up to @xmath138 .",
    "thus we obtain a strong sensitivity of the production channel up to high new physics scales .",
    "the blue curve in the plot shows the higgs production via weak gauge - boson fusion which is affected universally by the modified @xmath139 vertex and thus reduced by @xmath140 .",
    "the same factor applies for associated w boson production , and associated top quark pair production is suppressed by @xmath138 .",
    "the calculation of the subsequent possible decay modes of the higgs involves diagrams similar to the production channel , and furthermore gauge boson and kk - gauge boson triangle diagrams for the @xmath141 and @xmath142 final state .",
    "the @xmath139 and @xmath143 couplings experience only a very small reduction . yet",
    ", we recall the reduced production cross section , which renders a detection in the experimentally cleanest mode @xmath144 , in the region @xmath145 gev , to be more difficult . for a lower higgs mass the decay into two photons",
    "is enhanced and can overcome the suppression of the production cross section .",
    "the product @xmath146 is almost unchanged ( @xmath147 ) at the scale of @xmath130 tev and @xmath148 gev , and even enhanced for a lower new physics scale .",
    "however , for an intermediate scale of @xmath149 tev the cancellation in the production cross section becomes stronger in the low @xmath150 region , and the product drops severely to @xmath151 of the size expected in the sm .",
    "we end this presentation with a surprising observation about the possible size of flavor changing top decays . for a higgs coupling to fermions one usually expects factors of the corresponding fermion masses @xmath152 , stemming from the yukawa mechanism . assuming this for the rs model , one would expect the branching ratio of the flavor changing decay @xmath153 , if kinematically allowed , to be typically two orders of magnitude smaller than for the decay @xmath154 .",
    "models with heavy vector - like quarks can behave differently , if those quarks mix with the sm quarks and additionally couple to the higgs boson with chiralities opposite to the sm , _",
    "i.e. _  if the higgs couples to a heavy left handed singlet and a heavy right handed doublet . under those conditions an effective operator @xmath155",
    "is induced , which contributes differently to masses and yukawa couplings @xcite .",
    "a correct treatment of the higgs localization in rs shows that , even though heavy `` wrong chirality '' fermion wave - functions are zero on the ir brane by orbifold boundary conditions , the described type of misalignment exists and contributes to higgs fcncs @xcite .",
    "numerically this makes the decay @xmath153 typically even an order of magnitude larger than @xmath156 .",
    "we show this for a reference higgs mass @xmath157 gev in figure [ fig : tcplots ] , where we also indicate the experimental prospect of detecting the process via the subsequent decay into @xmath158 + jet @xcite at later stages of the lhc running . for a lighter higgs mass of @xmath148",
    "gev one multiplies the shown branching ratio with a factor of @xmath159 .",
