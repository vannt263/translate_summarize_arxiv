    "the @xmath0 disintegration : @xmath1pp@xmath2 , p@xmath3 was studied at fermilab by h. park _ et al .",
    "the data were taken by the hypercp ( e871 ) collaboration .",
    "the authors observed a narrow range of dimuon masses , and supposed that the decay may proceed via a neutral intermediate state p@xmath5 , with a mass m=214.3  mev @xmath6 0.5  mev .",
    "several theoretical works were done assuming the existence of this new particle .",
    "@xcite assume a fundamental spin zero boson , which couple to quarks with flavor changing transition s@xmath7d@xmath8 .",
    "they estimate the scalar and pseudoscalar coupling constants and evaluate several branching ratios .",
    "xiao - gang he _ et al . _",
    "@xcite re - examine the disintegration mode within the standard model , and find that , to be consistent with observations , the particles have small widths , short lived do not interact strongly .",
    "geng and hsiao @xcite found that the p@xmath2 can not be scalar or vector but pseudoscalar , and determine that the decay width should be as small as @xmath410@xmath9mev .",
    "gorbunov and rubakov @xcite discuss a sgoldstino interpretation of this possible particle .",
    "the experimental observation was based on three events . in order to eventually strengthen this result by a direct observation ,",
    "we look at already existing data and try to observe a possible signature of a small peak , or a small shoulder , at a mass not far from the mass of p@xmath2 . such mass can be observed , either in the invariant mass of two muons , m@xmath10 , or in missing masses of different reactions , studied with incident leptons as well as with incident hadrons .",
    "however the signal , if any , is expected to be small . if looked for in missing mass data , it will be superposed to a relatively large tail of one pion missing mass .",
    "therefore the signal - if any - can only be observed in precise data , with large statistics , good resolution and small binning .",
    "moreover , the mass range studied must be small , in the 180@xmath11m@xmath11250  mev range .",
    "such data are scarce and concern reactions studied at rather low incident energies , with good resolution .",
    "when we found a hint for a small effect , we read out and reanalyzed the data .",
    "several of such structures were selected and are presented below .",
    "the pp@xmath7ppx reaction was studied at saturne ( spes3 beam line ) , at t@xmath12=1520 , 1805 , and 2100  mev @xcite .",
    "the missing mass displays a broad structure , in the mass range 280@xmath11m@xmath11580  mev , unstable for different kinematical conditions and slightly oscillating @xcite , previously called the abc effect ; it was analyzed as being due to a superposition of four mesonic states : m=310  mev , 350  mev , 430  mev , and 495  mev @xcite .",
    "since the widths of the missing mass peaks increase for increasing spectrometer angles , we keep only the three lowest angle spectra at t@xmath12=1520  mev , add them , and show the resulting spectra in fig .",
    "the high counting rate allows to extract a clear peak at m@xmath13=216.5  mev .",
    "the reaction pp@xmath7pp@xmath14 was studied close to threshold at celsius @xcite .",
    "the missing mass data , after integration over two channels , are shown in fig .",
    "the two @xmath15 phase space starts at m@xmath16240  mev .",
    "the events in the range 170  @xmath11m@xmath17 240  mev , are mostly physical as the background contribution is estimated to be lower than 10 events / channel .",
    "the pp@xmath7ppx reaction was also studied at j@xmath18lich cosy - tof @xcite .",
    "both protons in the final state were detected in order to study the @xmath19 production .",
    "the data were read and shown in fig .",
    "since they are given in the original work as a function of the missing mass squared with constant binning ( @xmath20m@xmath13=0.002  gev@xmath21 ) , they are plotted as given up to m@xmath13=210  mev , ( empty circles ) , and for larger missing mass they are integrated over two channels ( full circles ) .",
    "the peak corresponding to @xmath15 missing mass is fitted by a gaussian , at m@xmath13=135  mev ( @xmath22=67  mev ) , and the data at larger missing mass are fitted with a polynomial .",
    "two structures can be extracted , the first one at m=197  mev , not valid statistically , and the second at m=224  mev .",
    "they are very narrow , therefore , if fitted by only one structure , which includes both narrow structures , they result in a broad gaussian centered at m=214  mev ( dashed curve in fig  1(c ) )      the @xmath15 electroproduction at threshold for q@xmath21=0.05  gev@xmath21 was measured at mami @xcite .",
    "the missing mass spectrum , up to m@xmath13=200  mev is given in fig .",
    "3(b ) of @xcite , after background subtraction .",
    "the data are read , integrated by 4 channels and reported in fig .",
    "a peak at m@xmath13=182  mev is clearly observed .",
    "indeed , the resolution in these data is as good as fwhm=2.2  mev , as given in the @xmath15 peak ( removed here to enhance the mass range discussed ) .",
    "the increase of the number of events between 48@xmath11m@xmath23  - m@xmath2456  mev is physical .",
    "the contribution from two pion production , is negligible at m@xmath25 180  mev .",
    "the roper resonance was studied at jlab hall a using the p(@xmath26 reaction @xcite .",
    "two missing mass spectra were given at @xmath27=90@xmath2 and @xmath27=-90@xmath2 .",
    "no shoulder is observed in this last spectra .",
    "the values of the spectra at at @xmath27=90@xmath2 are read and shifted in order to put the @xmath15 peak at his right mass , namely at m@xmath13=135  mev .",
    "2(b ) shows this spectrum fitted with a gaussian and two polynomials .",
    "a small enhancement is observed at m@xmath13=196  mev .",
    "the @xmath15 electroproduction on the proton was studied in hall c at jlab @xcite , in the region of the @xmath20(1232 ) resonance via the p(e , ep)@xmath15 reaction .",
    "the authors give in fig .  1 of ref",
    ". @xcite an example of missing mass distribution for the reaction p(e , ep)x .",
    "these data are read and reported in fig .",
    "the widths of all @xmath15 and @xmath19 peaks are related to their masses ( proportional to 1/m ) .",
    "these widths fix the width of the small peak extracted at m=220  mev .",
    "several other peaks are introduced , following the results of the pp@xmath7ppx reaction studied at spes3 ( saturne ) @xcite . after introducing an arbitrary two - pion phase space , a contribution of the p(e ,",
    "ep)@xmath28 reaction is observed around m@xmath13=0 .",
    "more detailed data from the same experiment @xcite , are reported in several spectra where structures can be extracted in the same missing mass range .",
    "the measurements were performed for two values of the four momentum transfer squared between the initial and the final electron , namely at q@xmath21=2.8  gev@xmath21 and q@xmath21=4  gev@xmath21 .",
    "the measurements were performed for a few values of p@xmath29 and a few values of @xmath30 .",
    "four spectra are shown in fig .  3 for q@xmath21=4  gev@xmath21 .",
    "4 shows another selection of spectra corresponding to q@xmath21=2.8  gev@xmath21 . in both figures",
    "empty circles correspond to monte - carlo simulations @xcite and full circles correspond to data . in the missing mass range studied here an excess of counts",
    "can be seen between data and the simulation which were fitted by a polynomial . on the other",
    "the quantitative informations are given in table  1 .",
    "the discrepancy between data and simulation for m@xmath1760  mev has been attributed to the bethe - heitler process ( ep@xmath7ep@xmath28 reaction ) .",
    "we have looked at some existing data , in order to find evidence for the existence of a new boson , or a system of two leptons with opposite charge .",
    "all spectra shown here , display a structure , but at slightly different masses .",
    "however , there is an indication of a possible regrouping around several mass values .",
    "the statistics is too low for giving an evidence if the results privilege one unstable mass or a few better defined masses .",
    "we increase therefore the number of spectra studied , as those shown in figs  3 and 4 .",
    "the corresponding quantitative informations are summarized in table  1 .",
    "they favor a regrouping into several values ; the same conclusion is favored by the existence of more than one peak in the same spectrum , as in fig .",
    "1(b ) . in summary these narrow structure masses ( see fig .  5 ) ,",
    "are tentatively observed at : + m=181@xmath62  mev ( 5 events ) , + m=198@xmath62  mev ( 5 events ) , + m=215@xmath65  mev ( 12 events ) , + m=227.5@xmath62.5  mev ( 5 events ) , + m=235@xmath61  mev ( 3 events ) .",
    "+      we notice that the range exhibiting the largest number of experimental mass structures , namely m=215  mev , agrees with the value extracted at fermilab : m=214.3  mev @xcite .",
    "there is also a qualitative evidence in favor of a structure at m@xmath4214  mev .",
    "the pd@xmath7pd@xmath19 reaction was studied at celsius @xcite .",
    "4 ( lower frame ) in ref .",
    "@xcite shows a scatter plot of m@xmath31 versus m@xmath32 , where a careful observation indicates a lightly dark range around m@xmath33214  mev .",
    "the mass difference between the three lowest masses extracted before , is close to @xmath20m=17.5  mev .",
    "a mass gap of @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the electron mass and @xmath36 is the fine structure constant , was observed between several narrow hadronic exotic masses @xcite .",
    "such gaps for leptons , mesons , and baryons were pointed out long time ago @xcite and recently discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the mass difference observed here equals half this value .",
    "however , the masses of the narrow exotic mesons , baryons , and dibaryons were attributed to quark clusters @xcite , whereas the prevent peaks were first related to two muon states . in this case",
