    "we identify the responsible chemical pathways for this behaviour , then attempt to find an analytical equation that could be used in purely ( hydro-)dynamical codes for determining the average co / h@xmath1 ratio as a function of gas density and @xmath121 in turbulent molecular gas clouds .      while the _ main _ chemical formation and destruction routes of both h@xmath1 and co in the gas phase are very well known , in order to understand the region in the @xmath39 $ ] plane of fig.[fig : zcr ] where co is destroyed but h@xmath1 is not , one needs to take into consideration several more chemical reactions as a function of these two parameters .",
    "we perform a chemical analysis of three representative such models outlining that region ( their properties in tabulated in table [ tab : models ] and the rates used for the reactions presented below are shown in table [ tab : rates ] ) .",

    "for the formation of h@xmath1 the behaviour is similar for the model m3 , with the difference that the ion - neutral reactions forming h@xmath1 are : @xmath123 h@xmath1 is then destroyed _ in almost equal efficiencies _ by recombination and cosmic rays ionization in all models : @xmath124 hence cosmic rays , although an efficient mean of destruction , are not necessarily the dominant route .",
    "co on the other hand is formed mainly via neutral - neutral reactions in m1 , with the two most efficient ( @xmath125 each ) routes being : @xmath126 with some contribution ( @xmath111 15% ) from : @xmath127 in m2 , the reaction [ 7 ] is not important but the rest of co is formed via the ion - neutral reaction : @xmath128 interestingly , in m3 co forms only via the neutral - neutral reactions listed above ( i.e reactions [ 5][7 ] ) .",
    "however , _ in all models co is always very efficiently destroyed indirectly by cosmic rays , via he@xmath8 _ ( which forms via cosmic ray ionization ) with the reaction : @xmath129 it therefore seems that a main reason for a co - dark h@xmath1 phase is that a higher cosmic ray ionization rate drives a higher rate of destruction of co , but has a much less dramatic effect on h@xmath1 .",
    "it is worth noting here that he@xmath8 can be destroyed by reacting with h@xmath1 ; this reaction has a small barrier leading to its rate coefficient becoming a factor of two higher at @xmath130 ( i.e. the gas temperature that * ? ? ?",
    "* considered ) than at @xmath131 ( i.e. the gas temperature of the m3 model ) , possibly reducing he@xmath8 enough to allow co to survive at higher abundances . a thorough investigation of the chemistry , as a function of temperature , that can lead to a co - poor / h@xmath1-rich environment is beyond the scope of this paper but it is clear that chemistry resulting from a high cosmic ray ionization rate when thermal balance is taken into account is not easily determined a priori .",

    "* ) knowing the temperature of cr - heated gas in the co - rich and co - poor phases is also important .",
    "in fig.[fig : tgas ] we show the temperatures attained by the molecular gas within the @xmath39 $ ] parameter space explored .",

    "from this figure is also obvious that most of the temperatures attained by the gas are well below the temperature assumed by @xcite their isothermal treatment.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "quite unlike the fuv radiation fields incident on molecular clouds , crs can destroy co equally efficiently throughout their volume rather than mostly at outer cloud layers .",
    "crs can thus be the main regulator of the co-@xmath147visibility@xmath147 of molecular gas in sf galaxies with the fuv - induced co destruction a secondary one . only for low - metallicity molecular gas in high - intensity radiation the fuv - induced co destruction can surpass the cr - induced one .",
    "nevertheless , given that high average fuv fields are found in places of elevated sfr densities , and thus also of boosted @xmath43 , the two effects will always operate in parallel , even as the average fuv radiation fields will not follow the rise of @xmath20 to high values in a proportional manner in metal - rich sf environments ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "in future work we will explore the combined effects of high @xmath12 and @xmath20 on molecular gas with a range of metallicities . given the non - linear effects behind the fuv - induced and cr - induced co destruction",
    ", these may be much more dramatic than either effect alone .",
    "fuv - intense environments with low average metallicities will be typical in the early universe , either over entire galaxies ( e.g. ly - break galaxies , dwarfs ) or in the outer , metal - poor , parts of sf disks in the process of building up their present - epoch z(r ) gradients .",
    "our analysis has been based on the assumption that @xmath148 , and that crs penetrate into most of the volume of molecular clouds .",
    "there are good observational and theoretical arguments supporting both these assumptions , reviewed in @xcite .",
    "briefly , the first assumption underlies the so - called far - ir / radio correlation established for galaxies whose radio and far - ir emission are powered by star formation , while the second one is supported by @xmath149-ray observations of @xmath0-rich starbursting galactic centers , and by the thermal , ionization , and chemical states observed for fuv - shielded dense molecular gas cores in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "finally , if crs were unable to penetrate deep inside the fuv - shielded regions of molecular clouds there would be no molecules present other than @xmath0 since crs , by driving the @xmath150 formation in such regions , initiate the chemical network beyond the basic @xmath0 molecule ( itself formed on dust grains ) .",
    "the effects of strong turbulence on a cr - controlled co / h@xmath1 ratio , and its consequences for the co-@xmath147visibility@xmath147 of @xmath0 gas in sf galaxies , are difficult to assess within the static framework of our work .",
    "the necessity of a dynamical approach can be shown simply by noting that the turbulent diffusion timescales @xmath151 are typically shorter than chemical - equillibrium timescales @xmath152 , the latter approximated by the timescale needed for an hi / h@xmath1 equillibrium to be reached ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "indeed for an initially atomic cold neutral medium ( cnm ) phase ( and a canonical h@xmath1 formation rate on grains of @xmath153 ) it is @xmath154yrs , while @xmath155 ( with @xmath156 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ranges from @xmath157yrs for quiescent gmcs ( turbulent linewidths of @xmath158 ) to @xmath159yrs for clouds typical of ulirg environments ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) the supersonic turbulence that dominates the velocity fields of molecular clouds is expected to influence our results in two distinct ways namely : a ) by strongly `` mixing '' outer and inner cloud layers ( and thus also the respective abundances of the various species formed in those cloud regions ) , and b ) by controlling the molecular cloud mass fraction over the gas density range i.e. the @xmath160 function ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . early work on the first issue by @xcite indicates that it is the abundances established on the outer cloud layers ( i.e. the co - poor / ci - rich ones in cr - immersed clouds with realistic density profiles ) that will act to `` dilute '' the inner , denser , co - rich / ci - poor regions .",
    "furthermore , the typically stronger turbulence of the outer lower - density molecular cloud regions with respect to the inner more quiescent ones can only enhance such turbulent diffusion transfer of outer layer abundances inwards .",
    "these effects would then further reduce the co - visibility of turbulent molecular clouds immersed in high cr energy density backgrounds .    regarding the second issue",
    ", we note that galaxies with high average @xmath23 values like ulirgs are typically also those with much higher levels of turbulence ( and hence dense gas mass fractions which in turn `` fuel '' their high @xmath23 ) . indeed",
    "the face - on velocity dispersion of the molecular gas disks in ulirgs is @xmath161@xmath33(30 - 140)kms@xmath22 @xcite , much higher than in isolated spiral disks ( @xmath3310kms@xmath22 ) . as a result",
    "the underlying @xmath160 would `` shift ''",
    "most of the mass of a molecular cloud towards high densities ( @xmath162@xmath163@xmath34 ) , and thus towards the co - rich part of the @xmath39 $ ] parameter space shown in fig.[fig : zcr ] , perhaps despite the also high average @xmath121 expected in such environments . only hydrodynamical simulations of molecular clouds with such high levels of turbulence _ and _ the appropriate chemical networks for co and h@xmath1 formation and destruction can decide this issue . on the other hand",
    "it is worth pointing out that the cm - emission synchrotron disks of galaxies ( rough indicators of the extend of cr propagation ) are typically larger than the co - visible molecular gas distributions .",
    "thus starburst - originating crs may affect the co / h@xmath1 ratio beyond the starburst region itself , where lower - density , non - sf , molecular clouds may lie .",
    "a mainly cr - controlled co / h@xmath1 ratio in the molecular clouds of sf galaxies has some interesting observational consequences , which can be probed using the jvla and alma , the two interferometer arrays operating in cm and mm / submm wavelengths with high sensitivities .",
    "the jvla can image the cm synchrotron radiation emitted by cr electrons ( and thus serve as a probe of cr propagation through galactic disks and individual molecular clouds ) , while alma can image the spectral lines of various species emanating from cr - permeated molecular gas , to yield tests of a cr - controlled chemistry .",
    "more specifically :    1 .",
    "deep imaging of the cm continuum of gas - rich sf disks along with co @xmath5=10 , 21 and ci @xmath5=10 , 21 line imaging can reveal the distribution of cr - permeated molecular gas , and probe the structural characteristics of the molecular gas distribution as recovered via ci lines versus those using the two low-@xmath5 co lines .",
    "imaging of individual molecular clouds in nearby sf galaxies in cm synchrotron continuum as well as in co @xmath5=10 , 21 and ci @xmath5=10 , 21 lines in order to examine the effects of crs in individual gmcs .",
    "3 .   any molecular line observations constraining the average x(e ) ( ionization fraction ) within molecular clouds , versus cr distribution ( traced by cm continuum imaging ) , can reveal whether crs penetrate throughout gmc volumes determining their chemistry ( e.g. x(e ) correlating with cm emission brightness ) .    generally in high cr energy density environments we expect @xmath0 clouds to be marked by the usual co - bright emission emanating from the regions that are dense enough to retain their co - richness ,",
    "_ yet having ci line emission extending much further out than those co - bright regions _ , tracing a co - poor phase where co has been destroyed by crs . given the elevated temperatures of the latter phase ( see figs.[fig : xsec ] & [ fig : tgas ] ) we expect both the ci @xmath5=10 ( @xmath164@xmath3324k ) and ci @xmath5=21 ( @xmath165@xmath3362k ) to be substantially excited . in principle",
    "this allows ci line imaging observations of sf disks to access a larger co - moving volume of the universe and serve as alternative @xmath0 gas distribution tracers .",
    "in this paper we examined the impact of crs on the average co / h@xmath1 ratio in @xmath0 clouds .",
    "we find that even ordinary boosts of cr energy densities , expected in numerous sf galaxies in the universe , can destroy co ( but not @xmath0 ) , so effectively as to render potentially large @xmath0 gas reservoirs co - poor and difficult to trace using conventional co @xmath5=10 , 21 , line imaging .",
    "this is a density - dependent effect , with denser regions able to retain higher co / h@xmath1 ratios than low - density ones , for a given cr energy density ( and thus cr ionization rate ) .",
    "this may give rise to a second order effect with @xmath0 gas disks that host vigorous sf , appearing clumpier in co @xmath5=10 , 21 emission than they really are , their denser ( and clumpier ) @xmath0 gas regions having retained large enough co / h@xmath1 ratios as to remain co - visible , unlike the co - poor lower - density ones .",
    "furthermore , even for cr energy density backgrounds expected in the milky way , low - density gas ( @xmath166 ) can also be very co - poor .",
    "the cr - induced destruction of co leaves behind a ci - rich molecular gas phase , with only small amounts of cii .",
    "the ci @xmath5=10 , 21 lines are then the only remaining effective @xmath0 mass distribution tracers , encompassing both for the co - rich and the co - poor phase .    strong turbulence , often found for the molecular gas of vigorously sf galaxies , can in principle help maintain much of it co - rich ( and thus co - line - visible ) , by placing most of it at high average densities .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations of highly turbulent , cr - irradiated molecular gas , which incorporate the appropriate co , h@xmath1 formation / destruction chemical networks , are necessary to explore this issue . on the observational front deep ci , low-@xmath5 co line , and cm continuum imaging observations of sf galaxies and individual molecular clouds embedded in environments of high @xmath13 , are key in exploring a cr - regulated co / h@xmath1 ratio in @xmath0 clouds .",
