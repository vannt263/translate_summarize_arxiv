    "lumps of li and powders of feas and as in the molar ratio 3:2:3 were placed in an alumina crucible in an argon glove box .",
    "the crucible was inserted into a ceramic container covered by a cap and sealed in an evacuated quartz tube .",
    "the samples were heated to 1090@xmath116c with a rate of 175@xmath116c / h , held at this temperature for 4h then cooled down to 800@xmath116c at 6@xmath116c / h and then more rapidly to room temperature .",
    "clean crystals of typical dimensions @xmath117x@xmath117x@xmath118mm@xmath119 were mechanically extracted from the flux . a fe : as ratio of 1:1 has been confirmed by electron microprobe .",
    "six different samples from the same batch with different geometries were studied .",
    "they were cleaved from larger crystals to thicknesses ranging from 18 to @xmath120 m .",
    "electrical contacts were made using silver epoxy .",
    "owing to the very fast degradation of the surfaces under air exposure , the samples were covered with apiezon n - grease immediately after putting the contacts and very rapidly inserted in the cryostat .",
    "hall effect measurements were performed in the van der pauw configuration @xcite for three samples labelled vdp1,2,3 while standard 4-probe technique was used for magnetoresistance measurements in three other samples ( labelled fp1,2,3 ) .",
    "the hall effect was measured by exchanging the voltage and current probes in the diagonal directions of the vdp samples either in a fixed 14 t magnetic field ( vdp1 and 2 ) or by sweeping the magnetic field up to 14 t ( vdp3 ) . in all cases",
    ", it was checked that the hall voltage increases linearly with magnetic field , allowing us to determine unambiguously the hall coefficient .",
    "the transverse magnetoresistance ( mr ) has been measured on the samples fp1 and 2 at fixed temperature by sweeping the magnetic field from -14 to 14 t and taking the symmetric part of the signal in order to eliminate any spurious component due to misalignment of the contacts . as the mr becomes rather small above @xmath121k ( usually less than 0.05% at 14 t )",
    "great care has been taken to ensure that the temperature remains constant during the magnetic field ramp .",
    "we have used a cernox sensor which has been calibrated in magnetic field and the temperature was then regulated by compensating the incidence of the field on the sensor value .",
    ".the transport parameters for the different samples studied are compared with those reported in ref.@xcite.the values of @xmath30 are taken at the mid - point of the resistive transition .",
    "the residual resistivities @xmath20 have been determined by fitting the zero field @xmath24 curves with a @xmath0 dependence @xmath122 .",
    "the residual resistivity ratio rrr is given by @xmath123 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     diamagnetic shielding was also measured for sample vdp1 and gave an onset @xmath30 value of 17.4k with a transition width of 2k , in close agreement with the transport measurements .",
    "one can see that the coefficient @xmath21 is strongly dependent on the purity of the sample .",
    "this means that , as could be expected for a multiband compound , matthiessen s rule is not obeyed .",
    "consequently , the comparison between the values of @xmath21 and the electronic specific heat coefficient through the kadowaki - woods ratio , which is used to estimate the strength of electronic correlations in single - band metals , can not be done so straightforwardly here .",
    "as explained in the text , we have to solve a problem with four unknown mobilities and only three experimental parameters . from dhva results we know that the mobilities for the two electron bands are similar and",
    "must be larger than those of the hole bands .",
    "if we consider the limit where they are equal , that is @xmath124 with @xmath125 , we find that the mobility of the inner hole band is much larger than that of the outer one , and also larger than the electron mobility . in that case ,",
    "the effective number of holes defined as @xmath126 is equal to @xmath127 taken equal here to 0.03__h__/fe .",
    "a more physical solution can thus be obtained by increasing @xmath79 , which consequently lets the hole outer band participate to the transport and slightly differentiates the two electron bands , with @xmath128 .",
    "however if @xmath79 is taken too large , typically @xmath129__h__/fe , the mobilities for the two electron bands become very different , in contradiction with the dhva results .",
    "consequently @xmath130 is required to match the transport data together with the arpes and dhva results .",
    "the solution given in the text is obtained for @xmath131__h__/fe . at this stage",
    "we are not able to better refine the resolution of the problem and @xmath79 is taken @xmath11 independent , which means that the ratio between the mobilities of the two hole bands is assumed to remain constant with temperature .",
    "though this is not justified , this hypothesis should not distort the main conclusions drawn from this analysis .",
    "technically , the resolution of the problem then consists in extracting the different mobilities of the electrons and the effective mobility of the holes from eqs . 2 , 3 and 6 of the text .",
    "the values of the number of holes in the two different bands ( @xmath132 , @xmath133 ) and @xmath134 imply @xmath135 and the term @xmath136 in eq.6 can be neglected . the second term @xmath137 represents at most @xmath138% of the total mr coefficient .",
    "only one solution is found at each temperature , giving the different mobilities plotted in fig.[fig_mobility]a .",
    "one can see that the effective mobilities found for the holes and electrons are nearly equal .",
    "this explains why kohler s rule is well obeyed in this compound . indeed in a two - band model , this rule directly follows from the fact that the two different types of carriers have the same mobility .",
    "the low temperature behavior of the corresponding scattering rates weighted by the effective mass is displayed in fig.[fig_mobility]-b where goods fits with a @xmath139 law is found up to @xmath54k . although the actual @xmath80 extrapolated values has to be considered with caution as they depend on the chosen value of @xmath79 , we have checked that we always find comparable values of the order of 2 @xmath140s@xmath141 for all the carriers except for the outer hole band .",
    "this would yield mean free paths for the electrons about 5 times larger than those found in dhva experiments @xcite and thus let us foresee that the inner hole band should be also observed by dhva in our cleanest samples .",
    "the expressions ( eqs .",
    "3 and 4 ) given in the text for the hall coefficient and the transverse mr are the first order approximation in @xmath35 . at a higher order ,",
    "we get : @xmath142 this can introduce some saturation of the hall coefficient and mr when the second term in the denominator @xmath143 becomes comparable or larger than @xmath144 . for a compensated material with @xmath145 this term is always zero and no saturation of the hall resistivity nor magnetoresistance is expected with increasing magnetic field .",
    "deviations from a @xmath2 behavior can in principle occur if @xmath146",
    ". however , this is unlikely here as we found that the hall effect that should display the same effect remains linear in @xmath29 within a 5 10@xmath147 accuracy in the same temperature range .",
    "moreover , using the values of the effective mobilities found above , we expect at most a change of slope of @xmath148% for the mr at 20k between 0 and 14 t , while the observed deviation corresponds to nearly a factor 2 .",
    "consequently the downward shifts observed at low magnetic field can only arise from the contribution of superconducting fluctuations and its suppression by the magnetic field .",
    "fig.[fig_rho(t)-fields ] shows the resistive superconducting transitions of the sample fp2 for different magnetic fields up to 14 t parallel ( a ) or perpendicular ( b ) to the c - axis .",
    "only a small broadening of the sc transitions is observed with increasing @xmath29 , allowing us to define the critical temperature @xmath149 at the mid - point of the resistive transition for each magnetic field quite precisely .",
    "for the magnetic field applied parallel ( empty circles ) and perpendicular ( full diamonds ) to the c - axis .",
    "the error bars represent the transition widths measured at 10 - 90% of the resistive transitions.,width=302 ]    for both orientations of the magnetic field , the increase of @xmath106 with decreasing @xmath11 shows a linear dependence as shown by the full lines in fig.[fig_rho(t)-fields]c with a ratio between the slopes of @xmath150 in excellent agreement to what was found in earlier reports @xcite ."
