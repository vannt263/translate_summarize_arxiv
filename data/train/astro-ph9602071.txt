    "a number of authors @xcite have suggested that inhomogeneities in the baryon number density were produced in the cosmological quark - hadron phase transition and perhaps even persisted to the time of nucleosynthesis , which could alter the abundances of light elements . for this to happen",
    ", a few criteria have to be met , though .",
    "first of all , only a first order quark - hadron transition seems capable of generating large baryon number fluctuations . whether the transition is first order is still an unsettled question ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) . secondly , the mean distance between high and low baryon density regions , denoted _",
    "l _ , has to be larger than approximately one meter comoving at @xmath2mev @xcite , if inhomogeneous nucleosynthesis results are to differ from the standard homogeneous nucleosynthesis results ( otherwise , neutron and proton diffusion will erase the inhomogeneities prior to nucleosynthesis ) .",
    "other important parameters are the average density contrast between high and low - density regions , the average volume fraction of high - density regions , and the baryon to photon ratio .",
    "we assume that the transition is first order and focus in this paper on determination of the most important of the parameters , the mean distance @xmath3 .",
    "a first order quark - hadron transition in the expanding universe can in general terms be described as follows .",
    "as the color deconfined quark - gluon plasma cools below the critical temperature , @xmath4mev , it becomes energetically favorable to form color confined hadrons ( primarily pions and a tiny amount of neutrons and protons due to the conserved net baryon number ) .",
    "however , the new phase does not show up immediately . as is characteristic for a first order phase transition",
    ", some supercooling is needed to overcome the energy expense of forming the surface of bubbles of the new hadron phase .",
    "when a hadron bubble is nucleated , latent heat is released , and a spherical shock wave expands into the surrounding supercooled quark - gluon plasma .",
    "this reheats the plasma to the critical temperature , preventing further nucleation in a region passed by one or more shock fronts @xcite ( for the range of parameters used in the present investigation , bubble growth is described by deflagrations , where a shock front precedes the actual phase transition front . however ,",
    "if the shock fronts are very weak the quark - gluon plasma may not be reheated enough to sufficiently prevent new bubble nucleations in such regions @xcite .",
    "this reduces the mean distance .",
    "we will neglect this possibility , because of the very small amounts of supercooling we deal with here ) .",
    "the nucleation stops when the whole universe has reheated to @xmath5 .",
    "this part of the phase transition passes very fast , in about @xmath6s , during which the cosmic expansion is totally negligible .",
    "after that , the hadron bubbles grow at the expense of the quark phase and eventually percolate or coalesce ; almost in equilibrium at @xmath5 .",
    "the transition ends when all quark - gluon matter has been converted to hadrons , neglecting possible quark nugget production @xcite .",
    "how much the system has to supercool before the first hadron bubbles show up determines the distance between nucleation sites .",
    "this distance is called the ( comoving ) mean nucleation distance , @xmath7 .",
    "it is also roughly the distance between the shrinking , high - baryon - density quark droplets .",
    "@xmath3 is half that distance , and when we take into account that the universe expanded about @xmath8 during the phase transition , we have @xmath9 where the factor @xmath10mev scales the value of @xmath0 from a given critical temperature to @xmath11mev , where @xmath12 is defined .    in the bag model we can approximate @xmath7 in homogeneous nucleation theory without curvature energy in terms of the bag constant , @xmath13 , by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the latent heat and @xmath16 the surface tension .",
    "lattice qcd calculations @xcite suggest that @xmath17 , ref .",
    "@xcite finds @xmath18 and @xmath19 . with @xmath20 ,",
    "this gives @xmath21 m for @xmath22mev .",
    "we calculate the surface tension self - consistently within the multiple reflection expansion framework of the mit bag model and get @xmath23 and @xmath24 , corresponding to @xmath25 m .",
    "but we also self - consistently take into account the important curvature term and find a crude approximate formula for @xmath7 , @xmath26 note , that in this approximation the mean nucleation distance depends only on the bag constant ( or @xmath5 ) .",
    "thus the overall effect of including a curvature term is roughly a factor of 7 reduction of @xmath7 . with these estimates of @xmath7 in mind it hardly seems possible to get any significant deviations from standard nucleosynthesis , if homogeneous nucleation theory applies .",
    "however , homogeneous nucleation may not be the prime mechanism responsible for hadron formation .",
    "it is well - known from every day life that first order transitions are normally facilitated by impurities , such as dust or ions and container walls .",
    "think e.g.  of a charged particle entering a cloud chamber , or boiling water where ( half ) bubbles are formed at the bottom of the pot .",
    "such nucleations are denoted heterogeneous .",
    "thus it is obvious to consider the effect of such impurities on the quark - hadron phase transition .",
    "candidates are the topological impurities , like primordial black holes , magnetic monopoles , and cosmic strings or relic fluctuations from the electroweak transition .",
    "the idea that impurities could play a role in the cosmological quark - hadron transition is not new ( see e.g.  @xcite for a general discussion of the role of impurities in cosmological phase transitions ) , but normally it has been argued@xcite that the presence of impurities would just act as extra seeds for nucleation sites together with the homogeneous nucleation sites and thus reducing @xmath7 .    as demonstrated below , this picture is not necessarily correct ",
    "there are circumstances where impurities lead to a dramatic _ increase _ in @xmath0 , maybe even to a value of several meters , resurrecting inhomogeneous big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "we find that three limits with , respectively , small , medium and huge amounts of impurities , compared to the number of homogeneous nucleation sites , have to be considered .",
    "certainly , if only very few impurities are present in the early universe @xmath7 will be determined solely by homogeneous nucleation . in the other extreme , for a huge number of impurities",
    ", they will determine a @xmath7 smaller than the one obtained from homogeneous nucleation .",
    "so neither of these cases give large mean nucleation distances .",
    "any impurity tends to lower the cost in energy when creating the surface of the new phase .",
    "therefore bubbles of the new phase will nucleate easier around an impurity at a smaller amount of supercooling .",
    "this means that shock spheres from nucleations around impurities start reheating the universe earlier . and for some impurity number densities the whole universe has already been reheated before the amount of supercooling has increased to a value where homogeneous nucleation sets in . in this case @xmath7",
    "depends on the impurity number density , @xmath27 , on the time when heterogeneous nucleation starts , and on the time when homogeneous nucleation becomes important .",
    "for a large range of parameters , @xmath0 can be very big .",
    "we will make this qualitative discussion much more quantitative in section iii , where we also present a self - consistent bag model calculation of homogeneous nucleation , including for the first time the important curvature terms . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the thermodynamics of the phase transition and the multiple reflection expansion of the mit bag model , which we use to calculate the thermodynamical quantities .",
    "section iv contains a general discussion and a summary of our results .",
    "all the necessary thermodynamical information about the two phases is contained in the thermodynamical potential @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 is the chemical potential , @xmath30 the volume , and finite size corrections enter via the surface area , @xmath31 , and the extrinsic curvature , @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 where @xmath34 is the grand partition function .",
    "all other thermodynamical quantities can be derived from @xmath35 .",
    "for instance , the bulk pressure @xmath36 is @xmath37 and the surface tension @xmath16 @xmath38 because of the huge photon to baryon ratio , we can neglect all chemical potentials and simplify the equations for @xmath35 when we want to calculate @xmath0 , since @xmath39 in the early universe ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "( this is not true if one is interested in following the further evolution of baryon density contrasts . )",
    "the quark phase consists of massless gluons , massless ( or with masses of 510 mev ) @xmath40 and @xmath41 quarks , and a massive @xmath42 quark , where we use a broad interval , @xmath43 $ ] . in most calculations",
    "we have integrated numerically the @xmath44-quark distribution function ; however for simplicity we neglect the small @xmath44-quark contribution to the cosmic density when calculating the cosmological time - temperature relation from the friedmann equations .",
    "the gluons contribute with 16 degrees of freedom , while each of the quarks has 12 degrees of freedom ( including antiparticles ) . in thermal equilibrium with both phases during the transition are ( statistical weight in parenthesis ) electrons(4 ) , muons(4 ) , neutrinos(6 ) and photons(2 ) .",
    "the contributions from these particles cancel when we study pressure differences .",
    "the behavior of quarks is mainly governed by the strong interaction .",
    "it can , at least in principle , be described in the qcd model .",
    "but since qcd is a non - perturbative theory at low energy and therefore _ very _ difficult to handle , phenomenological models , like the mit bag model , or lattice qcd calculations are used in practice .",
    "the basic idea of the bag model is that the quarks can be treated as an ( almost ) ideal gas confined to a finite region of space , a bag , by what we may think of as an external pressure , @xmath13 , called the bag constant . in the multiple reflection expansion framework",
    "@xcite a statistical approach is taken and finite size effects of the bag are explicitly incorporated in the density of states formula eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) in terms of geometrical factors .    what value to take for",
    "the phenomenological bag constant is at present very uncertain ; it could even be temperature dependent",
    ". a lower limit on the bag constant of @xmath45 is set by the stability of nuclei , especially @xmath46fe , relative to @xmath47-quark matter .",
    "there is no upper limit available from physical considerations .",

    "it was shown , in the @xmath50 limit , by farhi and jaffe @xcite that a qcd coupling constant different from zero can largely be absorbed in a reduction of the bag constant .",
    "we assume this is valid at finite temperatures too and put @xmath51 .",
    "the multiple reflection expansion was originally derived for a quark droplet embedded in a hadron gas .",
    "but mardor and svetitsky @xcite have shown that it can also be used to describe a hadron bubble in a quark plasma , provided the signs of the volume and curvature terms are changed .",
    "the formulae below are for a quark droplet .",
    "the thermodynamical potential of the quark phase is then given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the thermodynamical potential for a single fermion ( quark ) or boson ( gluon ) , given as @xmath54 here @xmath55 is the corresponding grand partition function @xmath56 ( upper sign for fermions , lower for bosons ) where the density of states is obtained from the multiple reflection expansion @xmath57 @xmath58 is the statistical weight of the particle .",

    "for the massless gluons we have @xcite @xmath67 note , that these results for gluons have been confirmed by pure glue qcd lattice calculations @xcite .",
    "we treat the hadron phase as an ideal pion gas , where we calculate the pressure from @xmath68 using eq .",
    "( [ zi ] ) for bosons and only including the volume term in the density of states formula eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) .",
    "this approximation is justified because the pions , with masses around the critical temperature 100 - 200mev , are the lightest hadrons and semi - relativistic while all other hadrons are nonrelativistic and therefore contribute negligibly to the pressure for @xmath69mev .",
    "the pion pressure is much smaller than the bag pressure so even the pressure from fully relativistic pions will only increase the critical temperature one percent .",
    "a perhaps more serious problem is that pions are not `` point - like '' particles and excluded volume effects should be taken into account .",
    "the pions could in principle contribute to the surface term ( and curvature term as well ) , we do not know .",
    "however , the pions have only 3 degrees of freedom , while each of the quarks have 12 , so we would expect only minor corrections .",
    "the change in the thermodynamical potential , when a quark matter droplet of radius @xmath70 is formed in a hadron gas , is @xmath71 because the photon - lepton gas is in thermal equilibrium with both phases , it does not contribute to @xmath72 . only in pressure ratios",
    "is it of importance to include the photon - lepton contribution . in the cosmological quark - hadron phase transition",
    "hadron bubbles are formed from a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "mardor and svetitsky @xcite have shown that this situation can be described simply by inverting the system , i.e let @xmath73 .",
    "this inversion affects only the signs of the volume and curvature terms and not the absolute value of any of the coefficients .",
    "@xmath72 can then be written as @xmath74 or @xmath75 where we have suppressed the index @xmath76 on the hadron bubble radius .",
    "if we relate the temperature and bag constant as @xmath77 then from the multiple reflection expansion we have @xmath78 where the pion pressure is ( we treat the three pion types alike and use a mean mass of @xmath79mev ) @xmath80 and the @xmath42 quark pressure @xmath81 the critical temperature is found from @xmath82 ( the corresponding @xmath83 lies between 0.67 and 0.70 ) .",
    "the surface tension , where only the massive @xmath42 quarks contribute , is given by @xmath84 and finally the curvature coefficient @xmath85 where @xmath86 \\nonumber \\\\   & \\times & \\ln \\left ( 1+e^{-\\sqrt{u^2+\\tilde{c}^2}/x } \\right ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath87 is always larger than zero because of the large positive contribution from the gluons , even though @xmath88 can be negative depending on the mass of the @xmath42 quark .",

    "( [ dp ] ) can easily be differentiated with respect to temperature and the latent heat calculated numerically for fixed bag constant and strange quark mass . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we have plotted the latent heat as a function of the strange quark mass . and",
    "we show the effect of including higher mesonic states up to 1 gev ( the higher mesonic states have much less influence on the critical temperature , because the bag constant contributes with about @xmath90 of the pressure needed to maintain pressure equilibrium between the two phases .",
    "that is why we can safely disregard heavier mesons for @xmath91mev ) .",
    "it is evident that these states only have a minor influence on the latent heat .",
    "a good approximation is to use @xmath92 independent of @xmath93 .",
    "we adopt this approximation , but notice that some lattice qcd calculations suggest @xcite that the latent heat is much smaller , @xmath94 .",
    "we will discuss the possible discrepancy later .",
    "in classical nucleation theory the nucleation rate ( number of nucleations per volume per time ) is given by @xcite @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the minimum work needed to create the smallest possible growing bubble , equal to the change in helmholtz free energy , and @xmath97 is the probability of making a growing bubble .",
    "the pre - exponential factor depends in detail on the model by which the bubble growth is described .",
    "csernai and kapusta @xcite have calculated @xmath98 in the cosmological case ( relativistic particles and almost zero baryon number ) , but without a curvature term , and get @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the radius of a critical size bubble and @xmath101fm is the surface thickness of the bubble . @xmath102 has to be much smaller than @xmath100 , which it is since @xmath103fm , typically .",
    "finally the shear viscosity @xmath104 is approximated by @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the strong coupling constant .",
    "fortunately , as we will show , a temperature dependent pre - exponential factor like eq .",
    "( [ ct ] ) is not important when we want to determine @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the often used dimensional estimate @xmath107 is sufficient for this purpose .",
    "this subsection is for a major part a straight forward generalization of the work done by fuller , mathews and alcock @xcite to take a varying pre - exponential factor and , more important , a curvature term into account .",
    "their results ( with the correction mentioned in@xcite ) are recovered in the limit of constant pre - exponential factor and vanishing curvature .",
    "the change in helmholtz free energy is equal to the change in the thermodynamical potential in the limit of vanishing chemical potentials .",
    "thus , @xmath108 the radius of a critical size bubble is found by putting @xmath109 equal to zero . from this equation",
    "we get two critical radii @xmath110 the smaller radius corresponds to a local minimum in the free energy ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , the larger to a local maximum .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite this local minimum has some serious consequences , if it is real and not just a shortcoming of the multiple reflection expansion of the bag model , since it means that small hadron bubbles show up even above the critical temperature .",
    "it has been argued that these hadron bubbles are unstable @xcite , but at present it is unclear how to handle them . we will for now neglect this complication , keeping it in mind for later discussion .    a linear expansion of @xmath111 about the critical temperature gives @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the latent heat per volume , and",
    "the supercooling parameter for @xmath114 is @xmath115 this expansion is valid for the small supercooling @xmath116 we deal with in the cosmological quark - hadron transition .",
    "we then write @xmath117 as @xmath118 certainly @xmath96 can not be allowed to become negative if we insist on ignoring the minimum .",
    "this gives an upper limit on the supercooling parameter , @xmath119    combining equations ( [ nukrate ] ) and ( [ dfc ] ) gives the nucleation rate as a function of the small supercooling parameter , valid around the critical temperature : @xmath120\\ ] ] where @xmath121 we see that @xmath122 equals zero as we pass the critical temperature from above and increases very rapidly with @xmath123 . as a result",
    "nearly all nucleation takes place at the lowest temperature , @xmath124 , achieved during the supercooling phase .",

    "in figure [ fig5 ] we have plotted @xmath7 versus @xmath27 for fixed bag constant and different @xmath42 quark masses , in the most optimistic case where @xmath193 .",
    "notice the step function behavior and the broad range , more than two orders of magnitude , of impurity number densities , resulting in mean nucleation distances above one meter .",
    "the largest mean nucleation distance for given parameters is found when @xmath194 .",
    "this is a scenario where the shock waves from the nucleated hadron bubbles around the impurities have reheated the whole universe just before homogeneous nucleation becomes important .",
    "the corresponding @xmath27 can be found from eq .",
    "( [ etafinh ] ) by neglecting the homogeneous term , @xmath195 the corresponding maximal value of @xmath3 , comoving at @xmath2mev , is found by combining equations ( [ dnucopt ] ) and ( [ l ] ) into @xmath196    if @xmath197 and with a typical value of @xmath198 ( for @xmath24 ; otherwise @xmath199 ) one can have significant nucleosynthesis effects ( @xmath12 of some meters ) from impurities for a broad range of @xmath27 .",
    "for @xmath200 the approximations used in the derivations above break down , but in this regime the presence of impurities do not lead to large nucleation distances anyway .",
    "the surface tension rises steeply with increasing quark mass for small masses . for realistic @xmath40 and @xmath41 quark masses",
    "@xmath201mev and @xmath202mev the surface tension increases with about 30% when the @xmath42 quark contribution is near its maximum . and @xmath203 increases almost 70% to about 11 meters . if we artificially double the surface tension to mimic eventual hadron contributions , we gain more than a factor of 3 on the maximum mean nucleation distance .",
    "we have calculated the mean nucleation distance in a homogeneous nucleation scenario where a curvature term contributes to the surface effects .",
    "the framework of the multiple reflection expansion of the mit bag model has been used to calculate the surface tension and curvature term self - consistently .",
    "inclusion of a curvature term reduces @xmath7 by about a factor of 7 to less than 2 cm .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that the presence of impurities , for a broad range of densities , can result in mean nucleation distances above one meter .",
    "such large distances are needed if baryon diffusion should not have smeared out generated baryon inhomogeneities before the epoch of nucleosynthesis .",
    "it must be emphasized that this conclusion is qualitatively independent of the model used to describe surface effects .",
    "we have only assumed that impurities are present , that they lower the energy barrier and that the reheating mechanism is the same regardless of how the hadron bubbles nucleated .",
    "thus , similar effects could be important in other first order transitions as well ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately there are no reliable theoretical expectations for the nature or density of impurities , but we note again the coincidence , that the horizon distance at the electroweak phase transition has expanded to the interesting range of a few meters at the quark - hadron transition .",
    "( [ etaapp ] ) for @xmath158 in the homogeneous nucleation scenario tells us how uncertainties in the different parameters influence @xmath7 , which depends linearly on @xmath158 .",
    "we believe the curvature coefficient is well - known , because the major contributions come from gluons and the two massless or very light quarks . a significant surface tension contribution from the pions would raise @xmath158 and thus result in a larger @xmath203 and an even broader interval of impurity number densities , where the mean nucleation distances is above one meter .",
    "we have throughout used the self - consistently calculated latent heat of @xmath204 , even though some recent lattice calculations @xcite suggest that the latent heat is about ten times smaller .",
    "a temperature dependent bag constant that increases with increasing temperature may reproduce such a result , but no theoretical predictions of such a temperature dependence exist .",
    "however , @xmath158 , @xmath0 , and @xmath12 are all inversely proportional to the latent heat .",
    "thus , a tenfold decrease in @xmath15 results in a tenfold increase in @xmath158 , @xmath0 , and @xmath12 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the spectrum of nucleation site separations is calculated . a duality between the nucleation sites and large baryon concentration sites",
    "is assumed and the effect on nucleosynthesis calculated .",
    "if impurities play a major role , the nucleation site spectrum would look different . for randomly distributed impurities the spectrum would be broad .",
    "a sort of regularity in the impurity distribution would result in a very narrow distribution around the mean nucleation distance .",
    "such an approximation is often used in actual inhomogeneous nucleosynthesis calculations .",
    "a serious problem with the bag model in the form used in this paper is the local minimum in the free energy at about 10 fm , even above the critical temperature@xcite",
    ". one might think about removing it by introducing further corrections in the density of states related to zero point energy , color singlet restrictions , etcetera , but no recipe exists at the moment .",
    "we note however , that such effects will be most important for small radii , and since the maximum of the free energy barrier typically lies beyond a radius of 50 fm in the results presented above , the conclusions of the present investigation are not likely to be affected much .",
