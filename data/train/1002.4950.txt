    "according to current supernova ia hubble diagrams ( @xcite ) , and cosmic microwave background anisotropies power spectrum ( @xcite ) , the universe energy budget is dominated by dark energy ( about 75 percents ) .",
    "however , the nature of dark energy is still unclear .",
    "what are the properties and origin of dark energy ?",
    "how do the density and equation of state evolve across cosmic times ? what is the spatial distribution ?",
    "several physical interpretations for the observed recent acceleration of the expansion of the universe have been proposed such as cosmological constant , backreaction ( @xcite ) , quintessence ( @xcite ) and deviations from general relativity ( @xcite ) among many others . in order to discriminate between these models",
    "one has to refine current observations at the homogeneous or linear level , or to find new observables . in this article ,",
    "we focus on the latter idea by investigating the imprints of dark energy on cosmic structure formation using very - high resolution n - body simulations .",
    "we note that this article is complementary to @xcite .",
    "[ cols= \" > , < \" , ]         in order to gain further physical insight into dark energy s imprints on cosmic structure formation , one needs to investigate its signature at all scales : from galaxies inner profiles to hubble volume cluster counts .",
    "to this aim , we perform the unprecedented dark energy universe simulation series ( deuss ) .",
    "it consists in 9 grand challenge simulations with 1 billion particles each ( and up to 7 billions cells ) , resolving scales from 4  gpc down to 3  kpc for the three considered cosmologies : @xmath0cdm , sugra and ratra - peebles . taking advantage of its peano - hilbert domain decomposition , the mpi code ramses has been run on 4096 blue gene / p cores at the idris supercomputing center ( last trimester 2008 ) .",
    "it represents 5 millions mono - cpu hours ( that is to say about 600 years ) of computationnal time that have been obtained by the horizon project at luth .",
    "the run parameters are described in table  [ tab3 ] : simulations box lengthes are 162  mpc / h , 648  mpc / h and 2592  mpc / h .",
    "we backup three kinds of data during the runs .",
    "first , we save the masses , positions , velocities and identities of all particles for 24 snapshots for each simulation ( expansion factor @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) , that is to say a total of 216 snapshots .",
    "second , we construct 9 lightcones around an observer at the center of the simulation by dumping particles from the light - travel distant slice at each coarse time step . for the largest box ,",
    "the lightcones cover @xmath24 steradian up to z=1 whereas for the smallest volume , the opening angle is 10 degrees by 10 degrees .",
    "third , we save 6 samples of particles at every coarse time step in a parallelepiped of size @xmath25 times the full volume of the simulations .",
    "the largest number of coarse time steps is 1419 .",
    "the total amount of data is about 40  to .",
    "unfortunately , the output files are organized along the peano - hilbert curve which could be non - trivial to manipulate .",
    "they also contain a lot of double - precision and not - useful information ( except for restarting the run ) .",
    "we therefore run a parallel slicer in order to split the data in @xmath26 cubic regions or `` fields '' and to keep only useful simple precision data .",
    "we also develop and run a parallel friend - of - friend halo finder ( linking length b=0.2 ) on 512 processes .",
    "we detect all halos above 100 particles in half of the outputs ( the analysis of the others is on - going ) .",
    "we then sort the particles halo per halo and backup these 512 `` halo '' files .",
    "overall halo masses range from @xmath27  mpc / h to @xmath28  mpc / h , there are up to 500 000 halos per snapshot and up to 3 millions particles per halos .",
    "the total number of analyzed halos is about 20 millions ( 20 other millions will be detected soon ) . with this two kinds of files ( halos and fields ) ,",
    "most of subsequent post - processing can be serial .",
    "moreover , data are user - friendly to manipulate .    as an illustration of the results we show a composite view of the density field for the 3 simulations of box length 162 mpc / h at z=0 with color coding for each cosmology : @xmath0cdm ( red ) , sugra ( green ) and ratra - peebles ( blue ) . on large scale , the map is essentially black and white indicating little difference between cosmologies whereas on smaller scales ( 40 and 10  mpc / h ) the differences between the models show up ( multi - color filaments and halos ) .",
    "discrepancies are therefore amplified by the non - linear regime of structure formation and can help to break degeneracies between cosmologies .    our plan is to share these data with the `` dark energy '' community . to this aim",
    "we are starting the deus ( dark energy universe simulations ) consortium .",
    "the goal is to gather observers and theoreticians in order to analyse the data , prepare future dark energy observational missions ( weak lensing , strong lensing , bao , cluster counts , etc . ) , improve analytical predictions ( power spectrum , mass functions , pdf , density profiles , etc . ) , and better understand the imprints of dark energy on structure formation .",
    "we are also building a database to diffuse the results .",
    "the database should contain all the properties of all halos and fields from the different outputs .",
    "the strength of this dark energy universe virtual observatory ( deuvo ) is that it follows the ivoa data model to allow future interoperability .",
    "a website is also currently under development ( http://www.deus-consortium.org ) .",
    "this article can be summarized as follow .    1 .",
    "unlike most of the previous numerical simulations , we consider three realistic dark energy models .",
    "these models are calibrated on latest snia and cmb data and take into account quintessence clustering in the linear regime . as a result , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are lower for quintessence cosmologies .",
    "we run a series of pre - deuss high - resolution runs ( 130 millions particles ) .",
    "we distinguish three dark energy signatures on the non - linear power - spectra : linear normalisation and shape , non - linear amplification , and a record of the past history of cosmic structure formation ( which is not accounted for in most of current fits ) .",
    "we run the unprecedented deuss grand challenge runs in order to probe structure formation at higher resolution and on larger scale than before ( ie . from 3  kpc to 4  gpc ) for the three realistic dark energy models .",
    "the simulations evolve 1 billion particles and up to 7 billions amr cells .",
    "our data consist in 216 snapshots , 9 lightcones and 6 samples .",
    "we have already analyzed half of the snapshots and produced a catalog of 20 millions halos and 60 thousands cubic fields .",
    "these user - friendly data represents a unique way for observers and theoreticians from the ( newly - created ) deus consortium to seek for new observables using the deuvo database ( in construction ) .",
    "it will help us to break degeneracies between dark energy models and to improve our understanding of the role of dark energy on cosmic structure formation .",
    "this work was granted access to the hpc resources of ccrt and idris under the allocations 2008-i20080412287/i2009042287 and 2009-t20080412191/x2009042191 made by genci ( grand equipement national de calcul intensif ) .",
    "we would like to thank romain teyssier , simon prunet , stephane colombi , philippe wautelet and all the idris engineers for their great help in running deuss .",
