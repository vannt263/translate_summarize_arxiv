    "it has been well known that spontaneous ( continous ) symmetry breaking states usually support gapless goldstone modes which give arise various quantum fluctuations of local order parameters@xcite . in one dimension at zero temperature , long wave length quantum fluctuations can be overwhelming and extremely harmful to the establishment of long range order . depending on details of energetics and topology of order parameter manifolds , quantum fluctuations might result in complete symmetry restoring by driving the states away from the spontaneous symmetry breaking solutions , or lead to algebraically long range order instead of the conventional off - diagonal long range order in high - dimensional systems .    for @xmath1 nematic states of spin - one bosons in optical lattices ( either condensates or mott states ) studied recently in quite a few articles@xcite , indeed in one - dimensional lattices the symmetry is completely restored and resultant states are rotationally invariant . unlike high - dimensional nematic states , spin excitations in these states are fully gapped as a result of symmetry restoring .    from the point of view of @xmath2 euclidean space , one can also attribute , at least partially , the disruption of long range order to the proliferation of meron- or skyrmion - like topological instantons .",
    "this fact suggests that the topology of vacuum manifold ( mean field ) should play an important role in maintaining or destroying long range order .",
    "for instance , when a magnetic field is applied to @xmath1 nematic states , the easy axis of the nematic order parameter tensor is pinned in a plane perpendicular to the external field .",
    "this lows the symmetry of nematic order and the @xmath1 symmetry is reduced to @xmath0 one , i.e. the state becomes a planar nematic state . for nematic condensates",
    "this mechanism leads to a vacuum manifold of @xmath3/z_2 $ ] instead of @xmath4/z_2 $ ] in the absence of magnetic fields .",
    "the above observation then implies that in one - dimension in the presence of _ external magnetic fields _ long wave length fluctuations should not completely disrupt nematic ordering in a plane perpendicular to the external fields as pointed out in a previous article@xcite .",
    "instead one should expect an algebraically ordered nematic spin liquid . in this paper",
    "we are going to investigate this possibility from a very different starting point and develop a theory which fully and quantitatively characterizes field - induced algebraically ordered nematic spin liquids in one - dimensional optical lattices .",
    "a closely related subject , magnetically stabilized nematic order in three - dimensional bipartite lattices , has also been studied recently@xcite .",
    "it was found that the stabilization of nematic order can be studied via a mapping to the ferromagnetic @xmath5 model and the critical phenomenon is identical to condensation of ideal bosonic magnons .",
    "away from critical fields the nematically ordered states are described by weakly interacting dilute magnons .",
    "we are going to employ the previously developed mapping between the low energy hilbert space close to critical fields and the ferromagnetic @xmath6 @xmath5 model to further analyze one - dimensional field - induced algebraically ordered spin nematic liquids .",
    "though the general approach employed below is similar to that developed for three - dimensional lattices , the unique feature of dilute magnons in the one - dimension limit makes the current situation distinct and physics qualitatively different from that discussed in the previous article .",
    "in fact , it is the distinct properties of _ fermionized _ dilute magnons which lead to _ anomalous _ critical exponents as well as fascinating algebraically ordered nematic liquids discussed below .    in sect .",
    "ii , we are going to review some basic results of the mapping between the field - driven quantum phase transitions ( between spin singlet mott states and nematic mott states ) and the ferromagnetic @xmath6 @xmath5 model .",
    "we further demonstrate the linear relation between the pseudo - spin operators in the @xmath5 model and nematic tensor order parameter operators . in sect .",
    "iii , we study the critical behavior of these quantum phase transitions in the holstein - primakov boson model , and point out that one - dimensional quantum fluctuations strongly renormalize the critical exponents . unlike in three - dimensional lattices where the critical point is fully characterized by",
    "_ ideal bosons _ ( noninteracting ) , in one - dimensional lattices the critical point is characterized by _",
    "hardcore bosons with an infinitely large interaction constant_. and we believe our evaluation of the critical exponent is exact .    in sec .",
    "iv , we further investigate the critical point physics using the jordan - wigner s fermionic representation .",
    "we obtain an identical critical exponent as in sec .",
    "we argue that the critical point is also fully characterized by the free fermion model ; however the friedel oscillations , one of the basic aspects of fermions , do not appear in the correlation function of nematic order operators .    in sec .",
    "v , we further study the one - dimensional algebraically ordered nematic spin liquids close to critical fields using a strongly interacting boson model .",
    "we employ the technique of bosonization to evaluate various correlation functions in the nematic spin liquids and argue that in general these liquids , up to the friedel oscillations are equivalent to the luttinger liquids of fermions . in sec .",
    "vi , we conclude our studies and discuss some consequences of these theoretical findings .",
    "we introduce @xmath7 , @xmath8 as the creation ( annihilation ) operators for a spin - one particle in three orthogonal states at site @xmath9 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for mott states of spin - one bosons with antiferromagnetic interactions in optical lattices in an external field can be conveniently expressed as@xcite ,    @xmath10    here @xmath11 is the `` bare '' spin gap studied in ref .",

    "the ground state is always a spin singlet one and the mean field solution with nematic ordering is unstable .",
    "when @xmath12 is set to be zero , at each lattice site the lowest energy state is a spin singlet one ( @xmath20 ) and the first excited states are fivefold degenerate @xmath21 states .",
    "the ground state in this case is simply a product of spin singlets at each lattice .",
    "when an external field is applied along the @xmath22-axis , one of the five - fold degenerate @xmath21 states approaches the spin singlet and level crossing takes place . generally speaking close to the level crossing points at each site , two states @xmath23 and @xmath24 become degenerate",
    "; the on - site low energy hilbert space is spanned by the two states involved in the level crossing .",

    "has an @xmath0 invariance in the @xmath40-plane corresponding to the @xmath0 rotational invariance in the microscopic hamiltonian in eq.([motth ] ) when the external magnetic fields are applied along the @xmath22-direction .",
    "this @xmath0 invariance represents the @xmath0 nematic symmetry we are going to examine .",
    "furthermore , in general the truncation can be applied in the vicinities of all critical points where level crossings between @xmath41 and @xmath42 occur , @xmath43 .",
    "the main issue dealt in this work is the induced spontaneous symmetry breaking in the presence of external magnetic fields .",
    "particularly we are interested in the breaking of @xmath0 rotational symmetry in the @xmath40-plane when a field is applied along the @xmath22-axis .",
    "unfortunately all operators that are linear in @xmath44 , or @xmath45 vanish identically in mott states regardless whether the rotational symmetry is broken or not ; so linear operators fail to distinguish two phases which interest us .",
    "the rank - two - tensor order parameter introduced on the other hand vanishes only in rotationally invariant spin singlet states and develops nontrivial structures once states break the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "for this reason we introduce the projected nematic order parameter @xmath46(@xmath47 ) which is designed to signify the @xmath0 symmetry breaking in the @xmath40 plane as follows @xmath48 two constant tensors we would like to project away are defined as@xcite    @xmath49    and @xmath50 is the unit vector along the direction of spin polarization which in our case is along the @xmath22-axis .",
    "it is evident following the discussions in ref .",
    "( ) that the vacuum manifold ( mean field ) of field - induced spin nematic states is @xmath51 , identical to that of the standard planar nematic order parameter .    in the pseudo spin subspace",

    "the detailed form of the @xmath56-matrix depends on the number of particles per site as well as the level crossings involved .",
    "one can find more discussions on the calculation of the @xmath56-matrix in appendix a.    for instance for @xmath57-particles per lattice site , one finds    @xmath58    and for four - particles per site , one obtains    @xmath59    it is more convenient to further truncate the projected nematic tensor operator @xmath46 in the @xmath40-plane which interests us by only keeping the elements with @xmath60 .",

    "@xmath64    finally , the magnetization can also be expressed in terms of the pseudo spin operators .",
    "for instance , the @xmath22-component is simply proportional to @xmath32 . following the definition of the pseudo spin operators",
    ", one finds that @xmath65 ( here we have set the bohr magneton as one ) .",
    "the relation between the nematic tensor operator and pauli matrices , together with the effective hamiltonian allow us to investigate various nematic spin correlations in terms of the @xmath5 model .",
    "we also would like to point out that the subspace spanned by pseudo spin states is actually a _ polarization ( in the @xmath40 plane ) free _ subspace .",
    "that is    @xmath66    the absence of polarization ( in the @xmath40 plane ) is a usual property of a planar spin nematic state .",
    "as demonstrated in a previous work , the field - driven quantum phase transitions between spin singlet and spin nematic mott states can be studied in terms of the condensation of spin - two magnons in spin singlet mott states@xcite . to carry out discussions along this line ,",
    "it is rather convenient to introduce the holstein - primakov representation for the xxz ferromagnetic spin model . in this representation ,",
    "all spin operators are expressed in terms of holstein - primakov bosons ,    @xmath67    @xmath68 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of bosons satisfying the usual bosonic commutation relations @xmath69 ; and the raising and lowering operators are defined as @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
