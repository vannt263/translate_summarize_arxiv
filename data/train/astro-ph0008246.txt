    "giant radio galaxies ( grgs ) are the largest radio sources in the universe which are associated with active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "a common definition for grgs is that they are radio sources with a linear size above 1 mpc  kms@xmath3mpc@xmath3 and @xmath4 throughout this paper . ] .",
    "these enormous sizes make them interesting objects to study .",
    "why are they so large ?",
    "is it because they grow much faster than other radio galaxies , or are they extremely old radio sources ? which are the properties of their progenitors ?",
    "also , because their size is so extreme , they allow us to study their radio structures in detail and to use them as probes of the gaseous environment of their host galaxies on scales of a few hundred kpc to a few mpc .    since their discovery in the early seventies ,",
    "several individual grgs have been the subject of detailed radio studies at a variety of wavelengths and resolutions ( e.g. 3c236 by strom & willis 1980 and barthel et al . 1985 ; ngc315 by willis et al .",
    "1981 , ngc6251 by perley et al .",
    "however , systematic studies of grgs as a population have always been hampered by the small number of sources available and by non - uniform selection effects .",
    "since grgs are large and their radio emission is not very powerful their surface brightness is relatively low .",
    "this makes them difficult objects to detect or recognize in most large - scale radio surveys . as a result",
    ", a large fraction of the known grgs have been discovered serendipitously ( e.g. hine 1979 , de bruyn 1989 ) , hence the difficulty in obtaining a uniformly selected sample .",
    "the most uniform dataset on grgs available yet is that of 10.5-ghz observations with the 100-m effelsberg telescope ( klein et al .",
    "1994 , saripalli et al .",
    "1996 , mack et al .",
    "all sources have been observed in the same way and at similar sensitivities ( rms - noise @xmath5 mjy beam@xmath3 ) , so that the results can be easily compared to each other .    in paper",
    "i ( schoenmakers et al .",
    "2000a ; see also schoenmakers 1999 ) we present a new sample of 47 grgs selected from the 325-mhz wenss survey ( rengelink et al .",
    "1997 ) . in this paper",
    ", we will define a complete subsample of 26 sources with a 325-mhz flux density above 1 jy .",
    "this is the largest complete sample of grgs , with well understood selection effects ( see paper i ) , yet compiled .",
    "we have used this sample for several follow - up studies , among which a study of their radio properties using multi - frequency radio data . for this purpose ,",
    "we have obtained new 10.5-ghz radio data of 18 of these sources using observations with the 100-m effelsberg telescope ; the 8 remaining sources have already been observed with this instrument ( klein et al .",
    "1994 , saripalli et al .",
    "1996 , mack et al .",
    "we have used these data to investigate the high - frequency radio morphology , the magnetic field configuration and , combined with data obtained at lower frequencies , the spectral index distribution and spectral ages ( e.g. mack et al .",
    "the analysis and results of this study are presented here .",
    "subsequent papers will deal with the optical properties of the agn and their relation with the radio structure , and with the evolution of grgs , both in terms of cosmological evolution as in terms of intrinsic radio source evolution .    in sect .",
    "[ sec : the_sample ] we present the complete sample of grgs and discuss some of its characteristics .",
    "section [ sec : radio_data ] presents the new 10.5-ghz radio data and lower frequency data for the sources in the sample . in sect .",
    "[ sec : asymmetry ] we derive several source asymmetry parameters and investigate the presence of correlations between these .",
    "the ages and lobe advance velocities of several grgs are derived in sect .",
    "[ sec : lobe_velocities ] , and the energy densities and lobe pressures are derived in sect . [",
    "sec : energy_densities ] . in sect .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we discuss the results , focusing on the spectral ages and the environment of the grgs .",
    "our conclusions are presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .    throughout this paper , a spectral index @xmath6 is defined according to the relation @xmath7 between flux density @xmath8 and frequency @xmath9 .",
    "the grgs presented in paper i have been selected from the wenss survey using the criteria that they should have an angular size above @xmath10 and a distance from the galactic plane @xmath11 .",
    "we find in paper i that a wenss radio source is most likely included in the sample if @xmath12  jy / arcmin , where @xmath13 is the integrated 325-mhz flux density , and @xmath14 the largest angular size of the radio source .",
    "we have called this the sensitivity limit of our selection .",
    "the total number of sources in the sample of paper i is 47 , but at low flux density levels ( i.e. @xmath15 mjy ) several candidate sources have not yet been identified , and some sources may have been missed because they have not been recognized as single structures .",
    "therefore , we have selected a subsample of 26 sources on the basis of a flux density at 325 mhz , @xmath16  jy . at such high flux densities , it is unlikely that a source has escaped detection or recognition as a grg .    on basis of our sensitivity limit ( see above ) ,",
    "it is unlikely that a 1-jy grg will be recognized at a redshift below 0.014 , due to its very low surface brightness in that case .",
    "however , the lowest redshift source in our sample is ngc315 at @xmath17 , so no source needed to be excluded on basis of this limit .",
    "we have omitted two giant fri - type ( fanaroff & riley 1974 ) radio sources from the sample : 3c31 ( e.g. strom et al .",
    "1983 ) and hb13 ( e.g. masson 1979 ) . the considerations for doing so were the following .",
    "first , the observed size of sources of this class depends strongly on the surface brightness sensitivity of the radio observations ; only for edge - brightened frii - type sources , the angular size and source structure is reasonably well defined because of the presence of hotspots and the usually better outlined radio lobe morphology .",
    "the edge - darkened nature of fri s makes it unlikely that the 1-jy sample is complete for fri - type sources .",
    "second , the properties of the radio lobes of fri - type sources are known to be different .",
    "this is shown , for instance , by the different spectral index distribution in the radio lobes ( e.g. jgers 1986 , parma et al .",
    "1999 ) , which may indicate different mechanisms for the acceleration and ageing of the radiating particles .",
    "there are a few remaining sources which are strictly of type fri , but also show properties commonly found in frii - type sources , such as hotspots or sharply bound lobe structures .",
    "well known examples of such sources are da240 , ngc315 and ngc6251 .",
    "since the measured size of these sources is better constrained , we have left these sources in the sample , although they are excluded from many of the analyses in this paper .",
    "they are indicated as type ` fri / ii ' in tab .",
    "[ tab:1-jy - sample ] .",
    "our 1-jy sample therefore contains all non fri - type sources with a 325-mhz flux density above 1 jy , an angular size above @xmath10 , a linear size above 1 mpc , a declination above @xmath18 , a distance from the galactic plane @xmath19 and a redshift above 0.014 , in total 26 sources . of these , 16 are grgs which were previously known and 10 are newly discovered grgs ( see paper i ) .",
    "the list of sources and some of their properties are presented in tab .",
    "[ tab:1-jy - sample ] .",
    "the source b1918 + 516 has an uncertain redshift determination due to the faintness of its optical host galaxy and the difficulty we had in actually identifying it ; an independent confirmation is needed .",

    "boxes with a low signal - to - noise have been presented as limits in the spectral index profiles , so background effects should not be serious in these areas .",

    "in other sources , such as b2147@xmath20816 , such a behaviour is not observed . in some cases",
    "a likely explanation is that a flat - spectrum radio jet contributes to the extended lobe emission .",
    "the source b1209@xmath20745 is known to have a prominent one - sided jet pointing towards the north ( e.g. van breugel & willis 1981 ) , which explains the flat - spectrum ` plateau ' north of the radio core position in fig .",
    "[ fig : si - profiles ] . the same may be true for b1312@xmath20698 , which shows jet - like features in an ( unpublished ) 1.4-ghz wsrt radio map . however , for other sources such a scenario is less probable since no jet - like features appear in any of our radio maps . among the possible causes for the apparent absence of ageing in these sources",
    "can be mixing of the lobe material due to backflows in the lobes , non - uniform magnetic fields and changes in the energy distribution of the accelerated particles during the sources lifetime .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     an important issue is how the selection effects affect the results . the equipartition energy density , @xmath79 , is related to the total power , @xmath80 , and the volume , @xmath81 , of a radio source by @xmath82 . the sources plotted are from a flux density limited sample ( @xmath83 jy at 325 mhz ) , which implies that sources at larger redshift have , on average , higher radio powers and thus higher energy densities at equal physical source dimensions .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ueq - z_plot]a we have plotted the expected equipartition energy density as a function of redshift ( dashed line ) for a source with a flux density equal to the median flux density of the sample , a volume equal to the median volume and a spectral index equal to the median spectral index of the sources .",
    "clearly , the slope and position of this line follows the redshift relation of the measured energy densities well .",
    "this suggests that the observed relation of the energy density with redshift is most likely a result from our use of a flux density and linear size limited sample , rather than of a cosmological evolution .",
    "the energy densities are the intensity weighted averages over the two lobes . since these values are sensitive to the contributions from the hotspots , the values in the fainter bridges of the lobes may be lower . from the profiles of the equipartition energy density presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ueq - profiles ] we have taken the lowest found value for each source and plotted this in fig . [ fig : ueq - z_plot]b .",
    "we find that most sources still lie well above the line describing the assumed @xmath84 pressure evolution with @xmath85 dyn@xmath86 . also , the dichotomy between sources smaller and larger than 2 mpc still exists , which indicates that even the lowest energy densities that we measure in the lobes are systematically lower in larger radio sources .    we can only conclude that there is no evidence in our sample for a cosmological evolution of the energy density in the lobes of grgs , and that there is therefore also no evidence for a cosmological evolution of the pressure in the igm . on the other hand , we are also aware that we can not reject the hypothesis that the pressure of the igm evolves as @xmath87 , provided that the present - day value @xmath88 dyn @xmath86",
    ".    the existence of a population of grgs with lobe energy densities of @xmath89 erg @xmath90 at redshifts of at least 0.6 would challenge this hypothesis . assuming a length - to - width ratio of 3 , a size of 1.5 mpc and a spectral index of @xmath91 , this requires that grgs have to be found with a flux density of @xmath15 mjy at 325 mhz at these redshifts , which is well above the sensitivity limit of wenss and thus feasible .",
    "the flux density limit scales with the aspect ratio , @xmath61 , as @xmath92 and will thus rapidly drop below the survey limit of @xmath93 mjy ( rengelink et al . 1997 ) for more elongated sources .",
    "the only published sample of higher redshift grgs is that of cotter et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , which has been selected at 151 mhz with flux densities between 0.4 and 1 jy .",
    "these flux densities are higher than the above limit .",
    "the lobe pressures for the sources in this sample are presented by cotter ( 1998 ) .",
    "indeed , he finds an apparent evolution of the lobe pressures in this sample , but this is therefore most likely also the result of the use of a flux density and linear size limited sample and not due to a true cosmological evolution of the igm pressure .",
    "lastly , we have to mention the possibility that the environments of grgs may be particularly underdense with respect to the environments of other radio sources .",
    "this has sometimes been suggested as the cause of the large size of the grgs .",
    "if also the pressures in the ambient medium of grgs indeed are typically lower , then the selection of radio sources as large as grgs would be strongly biased towards regions with low pressures .",
    "since this must be valid at all redshifts , we may be sampling the lowest pressure regions of the universe only , which may be untypical of the general igm .",
    "we have studied the radio properties of a complete sample of 26 giant radio galaxies . these have been selected from the wenss survey at a flux density above 1 jy at 325 mhz and an angular size above @xmath10 .",
    "we have presented new radio observations of 18 of these sources at a frequency of 10.5 ghz , obtained with the 100-m effelsberg telescope .",
    "these have been used in combination with available data from the wenss , nvss and gb6-surveys for a low - resolution ( arcmin - scale ) multi - frequency radio investigation of the properties of these sources .",
    "we have found the following :    1 .",
    "the armlength asymmetries of grgs are different from those of 3cr radio galaxies .",
    "the grgs tend to be more asymmetric , which can not be explained as an orientation effect only .",
    "we find that in 15 out of the 20 frii - type grgs in our sample , the radio lobe which has the steepest spectrum between 325 mhz and 10.5 ghz also has the shortest arm .",
    "we conclude that this can not be result of a difference in the expansion - rate of the two radio lobes , thereby excluding asymmetries in the environment as the major cause of this effect .",
    "2 .   in profiles of the spectral index as a function of distance from the hotspots in the lobes ,",
    "we find significant steepening of the spectrum away from the hotspot only in a few cases .",
    "fitting these profiles with model spectra yields a typical advance velocities of @xmath94 , and a spectral age of 80 myr .",
    "such large ages agree with what has been found for several other grgs in the past .",
    "we find a dichotomy between powerful ( @xmath95 whz@xmath3ster@xmath3 ) and less powerful sources when we compare their lobe advance velocities , as deduced from spectral ageing studies , with their linear size .",
    "first , we find that for linear sizes around 100 kpc , the high power sources typically have much higher lobe velocities than the low power sources .",
    "this dichotomy disappears for larger sources .",
    "further , less powerful sources show a strong correlation between source size and lobe advance velocity , which extends all the way to the largest sources , the grgs",
    ". this may be largely due to the following : slowly advancing sources may never grow out to mpc sizes within the lifetime of the radio active phase of the agn .",
    "4 .   using the measured advance velocities , ages and energy contents of the lobes of the grgs",
    ", we find a typical particle density in front of the lobes of a few times @xmath96 @xmath90 .",
    "this is in agreement with earlier results on the density around the lobes of grgs using similar methods ( mack et al .",
    "assuming a temperature of a few times @xmath97 k , the thermal pressure in a medium with a particle density of @xmath98 would be @xmath99 dyn @xmath86 .",
    "this lies below the typical lobe pressures we find from equipartition arguments .",
    "profiles of the equipartition energy density along the radio axis in the lobes indicate that there often is a strong pressure gradient in the lobes , with the hotspots having the highest pressures .",
    "also this indicates that the radio lobes are overpressured with respect to their environment .",
    "the lobe pressures show a strong correlation with redshift .",
    "this has been noted before by , e.g. , subrahmanyan & saripalli ( 1993 ) and cotter ( 1998 ) .",
    "we show that the correlation in our sample can be explained by two effects : the use of a flux density and linear size limited sample and the method by which the equipartition lobe pressures are calculated .",
    "we find therefore no evidence for a cosmological evolution of the igm pressure between @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "our observations agree with a present day value of the igm pressure of @xmath102 dyn @xmath86 .",
    "this has been the first study of its kind employing a complete and relatively large sample of grgs .",
    "the main result is that on basis of the data presented here we find that grgs are both old sources , in terms of their spectral age , and that they are situated in a relatively low density environment , but also that neither of these two properties are extreme .",
    "therefore , based on the study presented here , their large size probably results from a combination of these properties .",

    "<S> we have formed a complete sample of 26 low redshift ( @xmath0 ) giant radio galaxies ( grgs ) from the wenss survey , selected at flux densities above 1 jy at 325 mhz . </S>",

    "<S> these observations , together with similar data of the remaining eight sources , are combined with data from the wenss , nvss and gb6 surveys to study the radio properties of the lobes of these sources at arcminute resolution . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate radio source asymmetries , equipartition energy densities in the lobes , the presence of lobe pressure evolution with redshift , the spectral age and the density of the environments of these sources . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the armlength asymmetries of grgs are slightly larger than those of smaller sized 3cr radio galaxies and that these are difficult to explain as arising from orientation effects only . </S>",
    "<S> we also find indications that the lobes of the grgs , despite their large sizes , are still overpressured with respect to their environment . </S>",
    "<S> further , we argue that any evolution of lobe pressure with redshift in these large sources ( e.g. cotter 1998 ) is due to selection effects . for sources which could be used in a spectral ageing analysis , we find spectral ages which are large , typically a few times @xmath1 yr . </S>",
    "<S> this is comparable to earlier studies of some giant sources and indicates that such large spectral ages are common for this class of radio source . </S>",
    "<S> the advance velocities of the radio lobes are typically a few percent of the speed of light , which is higher than those found for smaller , low power ( @xmath2 w hz@xmath3 at 178 mhz ) radio sources , and more comparable to higher power radio sources . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the grgs in our sample are the oldest members of the group of relatively high power radio sources whose radio powers have evolved to their currently observed lower values ( cf . </S>",
