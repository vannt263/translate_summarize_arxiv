    "the stationary state properties of one - dimensional driven diffusive systems are currently of much research interest [ 1 - 5 ] .",
    "these systems exhibit very interesting cooperative phenomena such as boundary - induced phase transitions , spontaneous symmetry breaking and single - defect induced phase transitions which are absent in one - dimensional equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "many physical phenomena such as hopping conductivity , growth processes and traffic flows can also be explained by these models [ 6 - 9 ]",
    ". one of the most basic model is the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) , which shows a rich behavior [ 10 ] .",
    "the asep is a model of particles diffusing on a lattice driven by an external field and with hard - core exclusion .",
    "models with more than one kind of particles have also been investigated .",
    "the asep in the presence of a second class particle ( impurity ) has provided a framework for the study of shocks ( see [ 5 ] and [ 9 ] ) .",
    "another model of this kind is the partially asymmetric simple exclusion process ( pasep ) . in this model",
    ", particles are allowed to hop both to their immediate right and left sites with unequal rates .",
    "this model has been studied both with open boundaries [ 20 ] and in the presence of an impurity on a ring [ 11 ] .",
    "a multi - species asep has also been suggested , which seems to be a simple realization for real traffic [ 12 ] .",
    "+ in this paper we consider a model containing two types of particles on a lattice of length @xmath2 with open boundary condition .",
    "the two types of particles , which we refer to them as `` positive '' and `` negative '' particles , move in opposite direction .",
    "the positive ( negative ) particles are injected ( removed ) from the left - most site of the lattice and are removed ( injected ) from the right - most site of the lattice .",
    "every where through the lattice , two adjacent particels interchange their positions , unless they are both positive or negative .",
    "the system evolves according to an stochastic dynamical rule as follows . in each infinitesimal time step",
    "@xmath3 the following events occur at each nearest - neighbour pair of sites @xmath4 @xmath5 : + @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 indicate a positive or a negative particle , respectively , and @xmath9 indicates an empty site .",
    "also , in each infinitesimal time step @xmath3 , the following events may occur at the first @xmath10 and the last @xmath11 site of the lattice : + @xmath12 for @xmath13 , this model reduces to the model introduced in [ 13,14 ] which using simulation data and doing exact calculations has been extinsively studied .",
    "these authors have shown that for certain values of the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath0 the symmetry of dynamics under interchange of positive and negative particles and of their directions is spontaneously broken .",
    "+ in reference [ 15 ] alcaraz et al have studied the @xmath15-species stochastic models with open boundary and found their related algebras , which appear in the mpa formalism first introduced in [ 16 ] .",
    "our model can be considered as a @xmath16 case which will be studied in details .",
    "+ the process @xmath17 has also been considered on a closed ring in [ 17 - 19 ] .",
    "it has been shown that when the density of positive particles is equal to the density of negative ones , depending on the values of the parameters of the model , three phases exist : a pure phase in which one has three pinned blocks of only positive , negative particels and vacancies ( where the translational invariance is spontaneously broken ) ; a mixed phase with a non - vanishing current of particles ; and a disordered phase . here",
    "we study the effects of the open boundaries . for certain cases @xmath18 or",
    "@xmath19 we are able to solve our model exactly and find the modified phase diagrams ( in comparison with @xmath13 case )",
    ". we will show that for @xmath20 , where the system is devoid of vacancies , only two phases exist . in @xmath21 limit the model has also two distinct phases in which the current of positive particles is equal to those of negative ones .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "@xmath22 we will present the exact solution of the model for the case @xmath23 using the known results .",
    "we will also obtain the exact generating function of the partition function of the model using the matrix product ansatz ( mpa ) and calculate the current of the particles in @xmath21 limit .",
    "in the last section we will compare our results with those obtained in [ 13 ] for @xmath13 .",
    "in this section we will show that the stationary probability of the model defined in @xmath17 and @xmath24 can be obtained using the mpa for two specific cases @xmath20 and @xmath21 . according to the mpa formalism",
    ", the stationary probability @xmath25 of any configuratin @xmath26 can be written as a matrix element of a product of non - commuting operators . before reviewing this approach",
    "we define some notations .",
    "we introduce two occupation numbers , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , for each site @xmath29 , where @xmath30 if site @xmath29 is occupied by a positive particle and @xmath31 otherwise .",
    "similarly , @xmath32 if site @xmath29 is occupied by a negative particle and @xmath33 otherwise . since the process is exclusive , so that each site of the lattice can only be occupied at most by one particle , each configuration of the system is uniquely defined by the set of occupation numbers @xmath34 .",
    "now the normalized stationay state weight for a lattice of size @xmath2 can be witten as : + p(\\ { _ i,_i } ) = 1 z_l w _",
    "{ _ i d + _ i a + ( 1-_i-_i ) e } v .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath35 in the denominator of the equation @xmath36 , which plays a role analogous to the partition function in equilibrium statistical mechanics , is a fundumental quantity and can be calculated using the fact @xmath37 .",
    "thus one finds + z_l = _ \\ { _ i,_i } w _ i=1^l \\",
    "{ _ i d + _ i a + ( 1-_i-_i ) e } v = w g^lv in which @xmath38 .",
    "the operators @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 correspond to the presence of a positive , a negative particle , and a hole respectively .",
    "these operators with the vectors @xmath42 and @xmath43 satisfy a certain algebra which will be discussed below .",
    "+      in this limit , as soon as a hole appears at a boundary site , it is removed .",
    "therefore in the steady state the lattice will be empty of holes .",
    "now the dynamical rules given by @xmath17 and @xmath24 reduce to + @xmath45 using the mpa one obtains the following quadratic algebra for this case + @xmath46 now if one imagine the negative particles as holes , the problem reduces to the single - species pasep with open boundaries and equal injection and extraction rates . as we mentioned , recently the pasep has been studies widely with open boundaries [ 20 ] . using the results given there , we find two following phases in the thermodynamic limit @xmath47 : + @xmath48 + the current of the positive particels @xmath49 is equal to the current of the negative ones @xmath50 and has its maximum value + j_+=j_-=. also the density of the positive particles @xmath51 in the bulk has a power law behavior + + .",
    "the density of the negative particels @xmath52 can be obtained using the equality @xmath53 .",
    "+ @xmath54 + the current of the positive particels is again equal to the current of the negative ones and is given by + j_+=j_-=(1- ) .",
    "the density profile of the positive particles is linear in the bulk which is a consequence of the superposition of shocks + + i(1 - 2 ) .",
    "this phenomenon has also been observed in the asep with open boundaries when the injection and extraction rates become equal [ 10 ] .",
    "another limit which can be solved using the mpa formalism exactly is @xmath21 .",
    "the operators and vectors satisfy the following algebra + @xmath55 following [ 13 ] one can choose + e = v w  ,  v w = 1 . then the algebra @xmath56 can be written as + @xmath57 this algebra is very similar to the algebra associated with the pasep [ 19,20 ] . here",
    "we adopt the same representation proposed in [ 19 ] .",

    "the radius of convergence is the absolute value of the nearest singularity of @xmath69 to the origin .",
