    "the investigation of hypernuclei using electromagnetic probes presents the following advantages :    * energy resolution of the order of few hundreds kev is obtained ; * natural and unnatural parity states can be populated in the produced hypernucleus , due to the large 3-momentum transfer ( ( @xmath3  @xmath4 250  mev / c ) and strong spin flip ; * _ mirror _ hypernuclei are produced with respect to those investigated with hadron probes ;    despite the very small cross sections of electroproduction of hypernuclei , jefferson lab is able to provide high - current and high quality beam for successfully performing such experiments . for this purpose , a pair of septum magnets and a rich detector @xcite were added to the hall a standard apparatus @xcite .",

    "shell - model wave functions are determined using a parametrization of the @xmath7 interaction that fits the precise @xmath8-ray hypernuclear spectra of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the new curve has been obtained with an improved calculation of the optical potential of the @xmath10 , consisting of a stronger absorbtion with respect to the previous predictions .",
    "now the agreement with the data for the ground state and the core - excited states is very good , while the discrepancy for the p - shell part of the spectrum is slightly increased with respect to the previous calculations .",

    "they are briefly summarized below :    * for the first time , the energy spectrum of @xmath1 has been obtained , allowing a direct comparison with the available data on the mirror @xmath12 hypernucleus ; * the use of a waterfall target @xcite allowed the precise determination of the binding energy , calibrated using the reaction of elementary @xmath6 reaction on hydrogen ; * the comparison with the theoretical predictions provide restrictions on the spacings of the levels contributing to each peak and , therefore , on the @xmath13 spin - orbits part of the effective interaction @xmath14 ;    the table [ tab : results ] and fig .",
