    "galactic - scale winds are ubiquitous in starburst galaxies in both the local and high - redshift universe ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "they are important for determining the chemical evolution of galaxies and the mass - metallicity relation ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and as a primary source of metals in the intergalactic medium ( igm ; e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". moreover , galactic winds are perhaps the most extreme manifestation of the feedback between star formation in a galaxy and its interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "this feedback mechanism is crucial for understanding galaxy formation and evolution over cosmic time ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the most well - developed model for galactic winds from starbursts is the supernova - driven model of @xcite , which assumes that the energy from multiple stellar winds and core - collapse supernovae in the starburst is efficiently thermalized .",
    "the resulting hot flow drives gas out of the host , sweeping up the cool ism ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although this model is successful in explaining the x - ray properties of starbursts , the recent observational results that galaxies with higher star formation rates ( sfrs ) accelerate the absorbing cold gas clouds to higher velocities ( @xmath8sfr@xmath9 ) and that the wind velocity is correlated with the galaxy escape velocity may challenge the traditional hypothesis that the cool gas is accelerated by the ram pressure of the hot supernova - heated wind , whose x - ray emission temperature varies little with sfr , circular velocity , and host galaxy mass , indicating a critical galaxy mass below which most of the hot wind escapes .",
    "these new observations may instead favor momentum - driven or radiation pressure - driven models for the wind physics ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; murray , quataert & thompson 2005 [ hereafter mqt05 ] ) .",
    "the model that galactic winds may be driven by momentum deposition provided by radiation pressure from the continuum absorption and scattering of starlight on dust grains was developed by mqt05 .",
    "however , the conclusions of mqt05 are based on an assumed isothermal potential and spherical geometry , and are thus most appropriate for bright elliptical / spheroidal galaxies in formation . on the other hand ,",
    "the theory of radiation - driven winds from accretion disks from the stellar to galactic scales has also been studied ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , but none of these works considered radiation from self - gravitating disks .    in this paper",
    "we answer the question of whether or not large - scale winds can be driven by radiation pressure from self - gravitating disks radiating near the eddington limit .",
    "these considerations are motivated by the work of thompson , quataert & murray ( 2005 ; tqm05 ) , who argued that radiation pressure on dust is the dominant feedback mechanism in starbursts , and that in these systems star formation is eddington - limited . for simplicity , throughout this paper we assume that the disk is of uniform brightness and surface density . in  2 ,",
    "we show that such disks are fundamentally unstable to wind formation because the radiation pressure force dominates gravity in the vertical direction above the disk surface .",
    "this result is qualitatively different from the well - known case in spherical symmetry . in  2 , we also discuss the applicability of this model to starbursts and then calculate the terminal velocity of the wind along the disk pole , and its dependence on both the sfr and galaxy escape velocity . in  3 , we assess the importance of a spherical stellar bulge and dark matter halo potential . in  4 , we discuss the 3-dimensional wind structure and estimate the total wind mass loss rate .",
    "we discuss our findings and conclude in  5 .",
    "we consider a disk with uniform brightness and total surface density : @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 define the outer radius of the luminous and gravitating portion of the disk , respectively .",
    "the flux - mean opacity to absorption and scattering of photons is @xmath14 .",
    "the gravitational force along the polar axis above the disk is @xmath15 and the vertical radiation force along the pole is ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) @xmath16 the extra factor @xmath17 in the radiation force integral compared with the gravitational force makes the eddington ratio along the pole @xmath18 a function of height @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the eddington ratio at the disk center .",
    "a disk at the eddington limit ( @xmath22 ) requires @xmath23 , or flux @xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath25 , then @xmath26 increases along the @xmath19-axis above the disk . in particular , for @xmath27 , the radiation force becomes twice the gravitational force as @xmath28 : @xmath29 because @xmath26 increases monotonically with @xmath19 , an infinitesimal displacement of a test particle in the vertical direction yields a net vertical acceleration , and the disk is thus unstable to wind formation .",
    "this result for disks is qualitatively different from the spherical case with a central point source where @xmath30 is constant with radius .",
    "if we consider the motion of a test particle in the outflow , the velocity along the @xmath19-axis can be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is initial vertical velocity .",
    "the first term on the right side of equation ( [ orbit01 ] ) is the `` radiation potential '' along the pole , while the second term is the gravitational potential .",
    "the right side is always positive if @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and thus the gas can be accelerated to infinity . on the other hand ,",
    "an unbound outflow is still possible in the sub - eddington case @xmath37 if the initial velocity @xmath34 is sufficiently large to escape the gravitational potential above the disk until reaching the critical height @xmath38 where @xmath39 , because the gas is decelerated from its initial @xmath34 until it reaches @xmath38 , it will be accelerated to infinity if @xmath40 . using this constraint we calculate the minimum @xmath34 required to drive an unbound wind in the sub - eddington case , and the critical height @xmath38 where the wind profile acceleration changes sign .",
    "figure [ fig_subedd ] shows the results .",
    "we introduce a characteristic velocity @xmath41 .",
    "the calculation is applied for @xmath42 , or @xmath43 . in this case",
    "the wind can be finally accelerated at infinity .",
    "the important point here is that for a disk with sub - eddington brightness , and non - zero vertical velocity @xmath44 , the gas can be first decelerated and then accelerated to infinity . for the typical random initial velocities of gas in galaxies @xmath45",
    ", we have @xmath46 , where the galactic thickness scale @xmath47 has been assumed for the second equality ( @xcite ) . for this reason",
    "we expect that even somewhat sub - eddington disks can drive outflows , as shown in figure [ fig_subedd ] .",
    "in contrast with the spherical case for which @xmath48 , uniformly bright self - gravitating disks allow the gas above the disk to be accelerated for the case with @xmath22 or even for some sub - eddington cases . in  4 , we show the 3-dimensional trajectories of wind particles launched from both eddington and sub - eddington disks .     to drive unbound winds ( thin lines ) , and the critical height @xmath38 turning the gas from deceleration to accelerations ( thick lines ) as a function of eddington ratio @xmath49 in the sub - eddington case @xmath50 , where @xmath32=1 , 0.9 and 0.8.,width=340 ]    we wish to apply this simple theory to starburst galaxies , which may reach the eddington limit for dust ( tqm05 ) . however , this application depends on the extent to which a disk - like collection of point sources of radiation ( stars ) may be treated as a uniformly bright disk . in the limit that the dusty gas of starbursts is optically - thick to the re - radiated fir emission ( @xmath51 g @xmath52 ; @xmath53@xmath54 g@xmath55 ;",
    "see tqm05 ) , as is reached in ulirgs , the self - gravitating disks around bright agn , and some starbursts , the approximation of a uniform brightness disk is likely valid .",
    "however , for @xmath56 g @xmath52 ( @xmath57@xmath54 g@xmath55 ) the disk is optically thin to the uv radiation of massive stars and the approximations of this paper are invalidated . in the intermediate regime",
    "@xmath58 g @xmath52 , depend linearly on the gas - to - dust ratio . ]",
    "the disk is optically - thick to uv radiation , but optically - thin to the re - radiated fir ( the so - called `` single - scattering '' limit ) , the application of the simple uniformly bright disk model is tentative , as it depends on the distribution of the sources relative to the dusty gas , the inter - star spacing relative to the vertical scale of the dusty gas , and the grain size distribution , which affects the overall scattering albedo .",
    "we save a detailed investigation to a future work , but here note two important points : ( 1 ) even for low-@xmath59 galaxies , the fraction of diffuse ( potentially scattered ) uv light may be substantial ( @xcite ) , and ( 2 ) if a finite thickness disk radiates at the single - scattering eddington limit ( i.e. , all photons are scattered / absorbed once in the wind ; e.g. , mqt05 ) , and if the disk is uniformly emissive and absorptive , then , for example , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 are the total , uv , and fir fluxes , respectivly .",
    "the radiation pressure is thus dominated by uv emission from the `` skin '' of the disk ( the @xmath65 surface ) , and @xmath66 . a similar argument",
    "can be made for all other wavebands that are `` single - scattering '' .    to proceed with our application to starbursts , the characteristic velocity @xmath67 is written as @xmath68 where we take @xmath69 g @xmath70 pc@xmath71 ) , and @xmath72 kpc . momentarily neglecting the importance of the surrounding dark matter halo and the potentially massive old stellar bulge ( both of which we evaluate in  3 ) , from equation ( [ orbit01 ] ) with @xmath73 and @xmath74 ,",
    "the asymptotic terminal velocity along the pole is @xmath75 this expression for @xmath3 can be related to the star formation rate ( sfr ) using the schmidt law , which relates the star formation surface density and gas surface density in galactic disks : @xmath76 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we approximate @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the gas fraction .",
    "since sfr@xmath79 , we have @xmath80 or @xmath81 which is consistent with the observation @xmath82 sfr@xmath83 in low - redshift ulirgs ( @xcite ) and @xmath82 sfr@xmath84 for high - stellar - mass and high - sfr galaxies at redshift @xmath85 ( @xcite ; but , see fig .",
    "17 from chen et al .  2010 ) .",
    "the observed scatter at a given sfr may be caused by different @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath34 , bulge and dark matter halo mass and the time dependence of wind fountain with the evolution of the stellar population ( see  3 ) .",
    "since we only use a simplified uniform disk model to derive equations ( [ terminal01 ] ) and ( [ terminal02 ] ) , a more definitive comparison with the data should await a model with realistic distributions of surface density , opacity , and brightness .",
    "if we assume the galactic disk is in radial centrifugal balance with a keplerian velocity @xmath89 , and we take the typical terminal velocity from equation ( [ terminal01 ] ) to compare to the mean rotation velocity as half of that at the radius @xmath86 , we have @xmath90 this estimate is again made in the absence of galactic bulge and dark matter halo .",
    "that the terminal velocity of the wind increases linearly with the galactic rotation velocity is also consistent with the observational results in martin ( 2005 , fig 7 ) .",
    "moreover , in their cosmological simulations of structure formation and igm enrichment by galactic winds , @xcite assumed @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the galactic velocity dispersion ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ) with the factor of 3 as an assumption essentially putting in by hand .",
    "our equation ( [ velocity_1 ] ) shows that it can be derived consistently if the wind is driven by radiation pressure from a self - gravitating disk radiating at or near the eddington limit .",
    "however , as we will show in  3 , the gravitational potential of the dark matter halo or a spherical old stellar bulge decreases the factor `` 3 '' in equation ( [ velocity_1 ] ) to @xmath93 , and can even lead to bound fountain flows .",
    "thus , the factor of 3 in equation ( [ velocity_1 ] ) can not be strictly obtained by the mechanism explored in this paper since all starburst galaxies have dark matter halos .",
    "nevertheless , equations ( [ terminal01 ] ) - ( [ velocity_1 ] ) are essential for developing an understanding of the maximum envelope of values for @xmath3 , and its dependence on the observed properties of starbursts .",
    "more physics of @xmath3 and its @xmath19-dependence is presented in  3 .",
    "finally , we note that the characteristic timescale for the wind to reach its asymptotic velocity is @xmath94 which can be compared with the timescale of a bright star - forming disk : @xmath95sfr . again employing the schmidt law , we find that @xmath96 or @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , the wind can be accelerated to @xmath98 before the gas supply is depleted by star formation.yr , the main sequence lifetime of the most massive stars . comparing with equation ( [ tc ] )",
    "we see that @xmath99 only when @xmath100m@xmath101 kpc@xmath102 . ]",
    "the galactic bulge and dark matter halo around the galactic disk are important to the wind dynamics .",
    "if we do not consider the luminosity from the galactic bulge , both the bulge and halo only act to decrease the asymptotic wind velocity , and may even cause the wind to fall back to the disk as a `` fountain flow '' . for the galactic bulge we employ a truncated constant density sphere , and we adopt the nfw potential ( @xcite ) to describe the dark matter halo distribution @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the scale radius and @xmath105 is the distance to the halo center . for simplicity , in this section",

    "the maximum positive velocity of the flow @xmath6 along the line of sight for non - edge - on disks is still correlated with @xmath203 of the disk ( see  3 ) .",
    "these facts may complicate the inference from observations of winds that they are unbound from the surrounding large - scale dark matter halo .",
    "clearly , more detailed work is required to fully assess radiation pressure on dust as the mechanism for launching cool gas from starburst disks .",
    "the main limitations of the work presented here are that ( 1 ) we consider only disks with constant brightness and surface density , ( 2 ) we do not compute the hydrodynamics of the flow , but instead treat the outflow in the test - particle limit , and ( 3 ) we ignore other physical effects such as the momentum and energy input from supernovae ( chevalier & clegg 1985 ; strickland & heckman 2009 ) , which may act in concert with radiation pressure ( mqt05 ; murray et al .",
    "the general case , with hydrodynamics , realistic disk brightness , surface density , and dust opacity profiles will modify the picture presented here .",
    "such an effort is underway ( zhang & thompson , in preparation ) .",
    "however , the basic conclusion that uniformly bright self - gravitating disks radiating near the eddington limit are able to drive large - scale winds  particularly in the high-@xmath59 limit in starbursts ( see  2) should not be fundamentally changed by more elaborate considerations .",
    "indeed , although we have specialized the discussion to starbursts and dust opacity , the instability derived in  2 is of general applicability .",

    "<S> we study large - scale winds driven from uniformly bright self - gravitating disks radiating near the eddington limit . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the ratio of the radiation pressure force to the gravitational force increases with height to a maximum of twice its value at the disk surface . thus , uniformly bright self - gravitating disks radiating at the eddington limit are fundamentally unstable to driving large - scale winds . </S>",
    "<S> these results contrast with the spherically symmetric case , where super - eddington luminosities are required for wind formation . </S>",
    "<S> we apply this theory to galactic winds from starburst galaxies that approach the eddington limit for dust . for hydrodynamically coupled gas and dust , we find that the asymptotic velocity of the wind is @xmath0 and that @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the mean disk rotation velocity and sfr is the star formation rate , both of which are in agreement with observations . however , these results of the model neglect the gravitational potential of the surrounding dark matter halo and a ( potentially massive ) old stellar bulge , which both act to decrease @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> a more realistic treatment shows that the flow can either be unbound , or bound , forming a `` fountain flow '' with a typical turning timescale of @xmath4 gyr , depending on the ratio of the mass and radius of the starburst disk relative to the total mass and break ( or scale ) radius of the dark matter halo or bulge . </S>",
    "<S> we provide quantitative criteria and scaling relations for assessing whether or not a starburst of given properties can drive unbound flows via the mechanism described in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , we note that because @xmath5 is longer than the star formation timescale ( gas mass / star formation rate ) in the starbursts and ultra - luminous infrared galaxies for which our theory is most applicable , if starbursts are selected as such , they may be observed to have strong outflows along the line of sight with a maximum velocity @xmath6 comparable to @xmath7 , even though their winds are in fact bound on large scales . </S>"
