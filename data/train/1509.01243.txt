    "the special theory of relativity ( sr)proposed in 1905 by einstein , has brilliantly solved many of the severe problems faced by physics at the turn of the 20th century .",
    "sr successfully provided a lorentz covariant formulation for both particle dynamics and for the the electromagnetic field .",
    "thus a covariant formulation in all inertial frames was achieved .",
    "0.15 truecm however , sr fell short of answering two central questions : 0.15 truecm ( a ) how should be physics formulated in non inertial reference frames , i.e. accelerated frames .",
    "0.15 truecm ( b ) how should gravity be reconciled with sr .",
    "clearly , newtonian gravity , where the gravitational potential @xmath3 satisfies poisson s equation @xmath4 , is not lorentz covariant(here @xmath5 is newton s constant , @xmath6 the matter density and @xmath7 the speed of light ) .",
    "this fact is in sharp contrast with maxwell s equations for the electromagnetic field which _ are _ lorentz covariant .    [ [ section ] ]  +    a theory providing answers to both questions was proposed by einstein in 1915 , the general theory of relativity ( gr ) .",
    "it took einstein ten years of hard work ( as we learn from his writings ) to bridge the gap and develop gr .",
    "gravity , in gr , is described by means of a curved four dimensional riemannian spacetime .",
    "the minkowski flat spacetime of sr is a special case which applies globally only when gravity is absent .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ] ",
    "+    gr is covariant under general coordinate transformations , and also provides covariant description of physics in general coordinate systems .",
    "thus , gr fully answers question ( a ) above . with regard to question ( b ) above",
    "the answer is quiet interesting . while being a relativistic theory , gr is _ not _ contained within the framework of sr ( contrary maxwell equations ) .",
    "rather , it implies that sr is incompatible with global gravity .",
    "it is of interest to note that all attempts at constructing a relativistic gravity theory within sr have resulted in either inconsistencies or in contradictions to experimental and observational data .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ] ",
    "+    the predictions of gr regarding planetary motions in the solar system , compact stellar objects , gravitational radiation , gravitational lensing and cosmology , are in accord with the observations .",
    "the most dramatic observational confirmations were made possible in the last decades .",
    "today , gr is regarded as the most elegant and successful physical theory ever proposed .",
    "the equivalence principle ( ep ) played a central role in the development of gr .",
    "as originally formulated by einstein in 1908 , it states : \" _ all effects of a uniform gravitational field are identical to the effects of a uniform acceleration of the coordinate system _  .",
    "this implies that a uniform gravitational field can be transformed away by an appropriate accelerated reference frame , i.e. one that is _ freely falling _ in the field . in this inertial frame",
    ", sr applies and all physical laws retain their sr form .",
    "the ep suggests that the two questions posed in chapter 1 are interconnected and may refer to two aspects of the same fundamental entity .    in the case of a non uniform field",
    ", the ep can be applied _ locally _ in a sufficiently small domain of space and time , so that the variation of the field can be ignored .",
    "thus , one can introduce a local inertial lorentzian reference frame in which _ all _ physical laws retain their sr form .",
    "this formulation of the ep is referred to as `` the strong ep '' ( sep ) distinguishing it from other formulations . for more details",
    "see articles 7 and 8 .",
    "the ep has some immediate implications :    * the ratio of gravitational to inertial mass of a body is a universal dimensionless constant resulting in the universality of free fall . * light rays passing nearby a massive body",
    "follow bent trajectories . *",
    "a photon traveling up ( down ) in a gravitational potential undergoes a gravitational red ( blue ) shift .",
    "+ let us discuss these points : * the gravitational mass of a body @xmath8 is defined through the gravitational force equation @xmath9 is playing the role of `` gravitational charge''.the inertial mass of the body @xmath10 is the one appearing in newton s second law @xmath11 .",
    "according to the ep , a given gravitational field can locally be replaced by an accelerated reference frame .",
    "thus , the ratio @xmath12 must be the _ same _ for all objects .",
    "this universality has been tested by etvoes , pekar and fekete ( 1922 ) who found that @xmath13 and later by roll , krotkov and dicke ( 1964 ) ( @xmath14 ) and braginsky and panov ( 1972 ) ( @xmath15 ) . *",
    "consider a box located in a uniform gravitational field ( fig .",
    "a photon is emitted in the horizontal direction from a. will it move along line ab or rather along a bent down curve ac , as a massive body will ? to answer this , consider an identical box which is gravity free but is accelerated upward with an acceleration @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "2 ) . according to the ep , physics should be the same in both boxes .",
    "let us emit a photon in the horizontal direction in the box of fig.2 .",
    "in this case the trajectory will be bent down parabola ac , since the box is accelerating upward in a free force region .",
    "the ep then implies that in fig .",
    "1 , the photon will _ also _ follow a bent down trajectory ac . bending of starlight grazing the sun s surface was first observed in a 1919 eclipse .",
    "substantially better confirmations were obtained in recent decades by measurements of deflection of radio waves emitted by qsos in the solar gravitational field ( counselman et .",
    "al . 1974 ) .",
    "gravitational lensing , based on the trajectory bending of photons , has become in recent years an important astronomical observational tool . *",
    "consider once more boxes ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "let a photon be emitted from the bottom and detected at the top . in box",
    "( b ) one can compute the doppler redshift by noting that , at the moment the photon reaches the top , the bottom has a relative velocity @xmath17 .",
    "thus the redshift is @xmath18 .",
    "according to the ep this is also the redshift in box ( a ) .",
    "now , since @xmath19 , we have @xmath20 whee @xmath21 is the gravitational potential difference between the top and the bottom .",
    "this gravitational redshift formula was verified to a precision of 1 part in 100 by pound and rebka ( 1960 ) and by pound and snider ( 1965 ) who used the mossbauer effect to detect @xmath22 rays from @xmath23 caused by the height difference of 22.5 meters in the terrestrial gravitational field .",
    "a verification with a precision of 7 parts in @xmath24 was obtained by vessot , levine , et al .",
    "( 1980 ) by monitoring the frequencies of two hydrogen masers clocks : one on board of a rocket launched to an altitude of @xmath25 km and the other on earth surface .      as demonstrated in the previous subsection ,",
    "combining the sr and ep can yield interesting results regarding gravity .",
    "one can use the same approach in order to obtain an insight into the general approach towards developing a relativistic gravity theory . in order to do so ,",

    "we are interested in finding the field equations that determine the geometry of spacetime . a guideline towards the formulation of the equations",

    ", this is no longer possible : the field equations dictate very specific equations of motion .",
    "this feature of the einstein field equations manifests itself in analyzing the initial value problem , concerning the data specified on a spacelike three surface , @xmath315 , that determine the future time evolution of the gravitational field and matter and matter fields .",
    "an analysis shows that one can not prescribe arbitrary initial values for the matter variables , the @xmath39 , and their first order time derivatives , but there are four constraints that the initial data must satisfy . a detailed discussion of these aspects is given in article 13 .",

    "in particular , useful coordinate conditions are those defining `` harmonic coordinates '' .",
    "define the coordinates to be given by four scalars , so that @xmath316 , that satisfy the curved spacetime harmonic equation ( hence the name )    @xmath317    in terms of the coordinates @xmath318 eq.(7.16 ) takes the form    @xmath319    eq.(7.7 ) defines the harmonic coordinates . in order to actually construct the harmonic coordinates ,",

    "one can not form a scalar out of @xmath178 and their first derivatives other than a constant number .",
    "a scalar can however be formed that contains also the second derivatives of the metric and is _ linear _ in them .",
    "the most general such scalar is a linear combination of the ricci tensor @xmath336 and a constant number .",
    "a short computation yields    @xmath337    with    @xmath338    the second integral on the right hand - side of eq.(7.12 ) can be expressed a 3-surface integral of @xmath339 over the boundary of the integration domain of eq.(7.12 ) . on this boundary ,",
    "the variation in @xmath178 is zero and therefore @xmath340 vanishes there .",

    "therefore , in analogy with the analysis given in section 6f , we find that @xmath342 .",
    "this relation does not contain a new information , however , since @xmath342 identically as result of the bianchi identities .",
    "we note that the field equations containing the cosmological term , eq.(7.5 ) can be derived if @xmath327 is modified to    @xmath343    the action @xmath327 can be split into two parts , one containing only @xmath39 and their first derivatives and the other containing also second derivatives of @xmath39 .",
    "the splitting is based on separating @xmath344 as follows    @xmath345    where    @xmath346    and    @xmath347    clearly , @xmath348 contains only @xmath39 and their first derivatives .",
    "the action @xmath329 is therefore expressible as    @xmath349    upon variation of @xmath39 that vanish on the 3-surface bounding the integration domain , the second integral on the right hand - side of eq.(7.17 ) has a zero variation .",
    "thus ,    @xmath350    @xmath351    note that @xmath348 is not a true scalar and it can be made to vanish by transforming to a local inertial coordinate system .",

    "@xmath348 is useful in constructing the gravitational energy - momentum pseudo tensor discussed in chapter 8 .",
    "in chapter 6 we found that the covariant conservation law of the matter energy - momentum tensor , @xmath164 , does not lead to a conserved four vector of energy - momentum for an isolated system .",
    "this indicates that the energy - momentum content of the gravitational field itself should also be accounted for in the total energy - momentum balance .",

    "there is no gravity present , one can obtain @xmath361 by transforming to non lorentzian coordinates .",
    "these , imply that there is no meaning to local gravitational energy density .",
    "this in full accord with the ep that states that any gravitational field can be transformed a way locally , by transforming to a local inertial coordinate system .",
    "nonetheless , one can define meaningful quantity representing the total energy - momentum of an isolated system , provided spacetime is asymptotically flat at spatial infinity .",
    "to do so , note that eq.(8.1 ) implies that    @xmath362 where the 2-surface integral is over a boundary enclosing the subsystem , at spatial infinity . for a spacetime that is flat at spatial infinity , and where no radiation escapes through the boundary , then in euclidean coordinates ( in which @xmath363 ) , @xmath364 on the boundary and the surface integral vanishes , giving rise to a conserved quantity    @xmath365    @xmath366 is invariant under arbitrary coordinate transformations that do not change the euclidean coordinates at spatial infinity .",
