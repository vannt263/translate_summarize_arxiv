    "as is wellknown , photon - photon scattering can occur due to the exchange of virtual electron - positron pairs , as described by qed or modifications thereof , see e.g.  @xcite , and may even lead to collective photon phenomena @xcite .",
    "photon interactions via the quantum vacuum , sometimes involving deviations from the standard model , has recently been much discussed in the literature due to advances in experimental technologies ( see e.g.  @xcite ) as well as new theoretical insights @xcite .",
    "moreover , photons also interact gravitationally , although this effect has been much less studied . purely general relativistic treatments of electromagnetic wave interactions have been made resulting in exact solutions , see e.g. @xcite , but these calculations are very different from the pure scattering processes , and do not address the interaction at the single photon level .",
    "on the other hand , it is not clear to what extent calculations of the gravitational cross - section using quantum field theoretical methods @xcite ( see also @xcite ) are consistent with classical general relativity . in order to shed light on this issue",
    ", we will consider the interaction of four electromagnetic ( em ) waves on a minkowski background , which is the lowest order scattering process consistent with energy - momentum conservation . by studying the classical einstein - maxwell system , but ignoring terms that do not correspond to pure scattering ( e.g. frequency shift terms )",
    "we will attempt to make contact between the classical and quantum field theoretical picture . calculating the classical coupling coefficients between waves of different polarizations , corresponding to the scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory , we are able to compare the classical cross - section with that of quantum field theory @xcite . while the results are approximately equal for small scattering angles @xmath0 , we find that there are significant differences for large @xmath0 .",
    "the likely source behind this discrepancy is that the quantum field theoretical calculation @xcite used the matrix scattering amplitude in order to define the interaction potential . as shown by ref .",
    "@xcite , such a procedure is not able to fully reproduce the general relativistic potential .",
    "finally we note that while gravitational photon - photon scattering is weaker than the qed scattering in most cases of physical interest @xcite , it should be noted that in the long wavelength limit , actually the gravitational cross - section is larger than that due to qed .",
    "we employ units such that the speed of light and planck s constant are @xmath1 , and use metric signature @xmath2 .",

    "we restrict ourselves to include only the resonant scattering terms and introduce polarization states perpendicular to the wave vectors as shown in figure 1 .",
    "note that the @xmath46 and the @xmath47 directions coincide .",
    "we thus have @xmath48 with @xmath49 , and @xmath50    . ]",
    "after some lengthy but straightforward algebra we end up with the following coupling equations describing the evolution of the wave amplitudes to leading order @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 for symmetry reasons @xmath57 and @xmath58 can be found from ( [ deap])([dedp ] ) respectively by interchanging @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the coupling coefficients only depend on the scattering angle @xmath0 , and in the limit when @xmath61 both @xmath62 and @xmath63 become infinite while @xmath64 .",
    "the small angle divergence in @xmath62 and @xmath63 is a consquence of the infinite range of the gravitational force .",
    "however , the coefficients @xmath65 and @xmath66 must remain finite for all angles , as those coefficients not only describe scattering an angle @xmath67 , but also correspond to a change in the polarization state .    in order to check the consistency of our results , we assume long pulses , i.e.  @xmath68 , such that the time derivative of the total energy density , @xmath69 ( where the sum is over @xmath70 ) , can be easily calculated . carrying out the sum , it is found that all the scattering terms cancel , and thus we deduce that the evolution equations ( [ deap])-([dedp ] ) are energy conserving .",
    "next we rewrite ( [ deap])([dedp ] ) in terms of the vector potentials , which rescales the coupling coefficients ( [ e - coupling ] ) by a factor @xmath71 . noting that the rescaled coupling coefficients corresponds to the scattering amplitudes , and following ref .",
    "@xcite , we find that the unpolarized differential cross - section can be calculated as @xmath72 where the square of the scattering matrix amplitude averaged over all polarization states is given by    @xmath73    this result should be compared with the same quantity calculated by quantum field theoretical methods , i.e. eq . ( 15 ) in ref .",
    "it turns out that the differential cross - sections agree in the limit @xmath74 , but as seen from fig 2 , where the classical and quantum field theoretical expressions are shown , the two expressions differ slightly in general . in order to resolve the difference more accurately ,",
    "the ratio of the cross - sections are shown in fig .",
    "3 , where one should note the agreement for small angles .",
    "however , for general angles the expressions clearly disagree , and it is natural to ask what causes this discrepancy . to answer this question we note that ref .",
    "@xcite has used the matrix scattering amplitude to determine the interaction potential . as demonstrated by ref .",
    "@xcite , however , such a procedure is not sufficient to fully reproduce the general relativistic potential . as the general relativistic deviation from newtonian behavior becomes more pronounced for large scattering angles",
    ", this explains the deviation for general angles , but also the agreement in the small angle limit .         and @xmath75 , respectively , as a function of scattering angle .",
    "comparing the calculated cross - section for gravitational photon - photon scattering eq .",
    "( [ cross - section ] ) with that from qed photon - photon scattering ( due to exchange of virtual electron - positron pairs ) , we find that they have different frequency dependence .",
    "the former is proportional to @xmath76 while the latter is proportional to @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "noting from eq .",
    "( [ cross - section ] ) that @xmath78 ( letting @xmath79 ) , where @xmath80 is the planck length and @xmath81 the wavelength , and comparing with the qed expression for the cross - section ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we find that the qed and gravitational cross - sections are comparable for frequencies @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the classical electron radius , @xmath84 is the compton wavelength , and we have reinstated the speed of light @xmath85 . thus the gravitational effects become the dominant contribution to the cross - section for frequencies @xmath86 and lower .",
    "still , the cross - section is very small , and we need extremely large photon densities for gravitational photon - photon scattering to influence the dynamics .",
    "situations that could be of interest to study in more detail involve the dense photon gas surrounding pulsars @xcite , as well as the photon gas in the early universe @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we note that if the energy densities are sufficiently high @xcite , the timescales for nonlinear evolution will not be determined by the cross - section , even if the spectrum is strongly incoherent .",
    "instead the characteristic time - scale must be found from weak turbulence theories @xcite .",
    "using the so called random phase approximation , the phase dependence can be integrated out , and evolution equations for the spectral energy densities are derived @xcite .",
    "graviton mediated photon - photon scattering share many parameter similarities with photon - graviton pair conversion @xcite .",
    "while it is possible that gravitational photon - photon scattering may have applications to astrophysics and/or cosmology , the effect can typically be neglected compared to other effects , such as qed photon - photon scattering or , in the presence of matter , interaction with charged particles .",
    "thus our main aim here has been to make an explicit comparison with the quantum field theoretical result ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , which show a slight deviation from our general relativistic cross - section . as seen in fig .",
    "3 , the deviation vanishes in the limit of small scattering angles .",
    "we trace the difference between the quantum field theoretical and the classical result to the difficulty in determining the general relativistic interaction potential from the matrix scattering amplitude , as done by ref .",
    "an interesting problem , which is a project for further research , is to investigate whether a quantum field theoretical calculation can be improved to incorporate a fully general relativistic interaction potential .",
