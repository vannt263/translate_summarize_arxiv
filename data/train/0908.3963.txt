    "conventional sample preparation including dimple grinding and ar - ion bombardment @xcite from the substrate side in a gatan precision ion polishing system ( pips ) was used ( 4 kv , 2.5 kv and finally at 1.3 kv ) for the preparation of the top view tem sample used in the emcd measurements .",
    "propylene glycol ( water content @xmath6 ) was used during the grinding processes as water based solvents often lead to cracks in mgo substrates ( probably because of formation of magnesium hydroxide ) .",
    "the ion milling process was stopped when the size of the hole in the sample was slightly below 5  @xmath7 m in diameter . at these conditions ,",

    "a schematic of the sample is shown fig .",
    "[ fig : sample ] , together with its total thickness at different positions .",
    "a total handling time of about 10 minutes in air was required to transfer the sample from the vacuum chamber of the pips into the microscope .",
    "the microscope used in this article , and many of today s modern microscopes , use a schottky emitter as electron source .",
    "these emitters typically show a feature called side - lobe emission @xcite that must be considered when measuring the weak signals related to emcd .",
    "its influence on the emcd measurements is discussed in this section .",
    "the tem experiments were performed using a fei tecnai f-30st feg ( schottky emitter ) operated at 300 kv , equipped with a post - column spectrometer , gatan image filter gif2002 .",
    "side - lobe emission occurs when electrons are emitted from not only the tip of the tungsten filament but also from the relatively large faces of the emitter crystal .",
    "the electrons are emitted from the faces with different angles and can therefore also hit other parts of the gun system , for example the extractor anode plate .",
    "thereafter they can be backscattered or cause emission of secondary electrons @xcite .",
    "these electrons will be focused differently than electrons of the primary beam and result in a non uniform intensity distribution , observable in the diffraction plane .",
    "energy filtered diffraction ( efdif ) patterns without a sample in the electron beam reveals the distribution of the electrons in reciprocal space as function of the energy - loss .",
    "the appearance of the pattern will depend on the settings of the electron gun , the shape of the filament and its position inside the microscope column , and also on the energy of the electrons .",
    "an efdif pattern from the microscope used here is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : efdif - sidelobes]a , acquired at 700 ev energy - loss with a 20 ev wide energy selecting slit and no sample in the path of the electron beam .",
    "typical standard gun lens settings were used , 4500 v extraction voltage and electrostatic gun lens value of 2 which corresponds to 1000 v in gun lens voltage @xcite .",
    "a non - symmetrical pattern is observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : efdif - sidelobes]a , which has an intensity of 40 - 50@xmath8 of the transmitted beam intensity in regions where we typically would measure the emcd signal .",
    "this intensity should therefore be considered in emcd measurements when using schottky emitters , since it would superimpose onto the magnetic signal , and thereby distorting it .",
    "the effect of the side lobes has previously been considered when acquiring diffraction patterns from samples with a very large spacing ( such as in biological specimens @xcite ) , resulting in a hampered visibility of the diffraction spots that are close to the transmitted beam .",
    "it should be noted that the use of a small selected area diffraction aperture has been found to remove a significant part of the side lobe emission , although not completely @xcite .",

    "[ fig : dich - maps ] , are indicated with crossed circles . in b )",
    "the gun settings were changed to enter the so - called telefocus mode where the side - lobe emission can be strongly reduced by using the condenser apertures .",
    "both diffraction patterns were normalized by averaging the intensity at the position of the transmitted beam.,width=377 ]    there are two ways of addressing this problem @xcite : _",
    "i ) _ one can record reference efdif patterns ( without sample , such as the one in fig .",
    "[ fig : efdif - sidelobes]a ) with exactly the same energy range as used in the emcd experiment ; the reference patterns are then subtracted from the emcd data to remove the side - lobe emission . preferably _",
    "ii ) _ one can operate the microscope in the so - called telefocus mode where the side - lobe emission is strongly reduced . in telefocus mode the gun settings",
    "are changed so that both condenser apertures can be used for removing the side lobes . for the tecnai microscope used here the extraction voltage",
    "was increased to 4550 v in combination with setting the electrostatic gun lens to 5 ( corresponding to 500 v in gun lens voltage @xcite ) , which changes the position of the first cross over after the gun . at these settings",
    "the beam will go through a cross over point which is close to the plane of the first condenser aperture .",
    "the side lobes can successfully be removed by inserting a small first condenser aperture , while a small second condenser aperture is used for probe forming .",
    "the corresponding reference efdif pattern is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : efdif - sidelobes]b , revealing the efficient removal of the side lobes .",
    "another consequence of using the telefocus mode is that the intensity of the electron beam is strongly increased , which is useful for the emcd measurements as it can improve the signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "unfortunately , this also makes the alignment procedure more difficult ; the intensity of the primary beam can not be changed as normally on the fly by changing spot size ( strength of first condenser lens ) , because the gun tilt settings have to be tuned for each spot size .",
    "the high intensity of the electron beam makes it impossible to obtain a spectrum ( not in eels or efdif mode ) of the zero - loss peak unless the sample is used to attenuate the electron beam ( too high beam intensity can saturate and possibly damage this type of ccd camera ) .",
    "this complicates the alignment procedure of the spectrometer . here",
    "the gif was aligned when in normal gun operation using its built - in software routine , having an image at the viewing screen and no sample in the path of the beam .",
    "thereafter the gun settings were changed to enter telefocus mode and the automatic gif alignment was repeated , but now with a thick part of the sample introduced in the path of the beam to reduce the intensity on the ccd camera . typically during the second iteration of the alignment",
    "routine only small changes were applied to the settings and the non - isochromatic surface of the gif was recorded separately ( although still with the sample in the electron beam ) to make sure that the alignment procedure was successful .",
    "another side effect of using the telefocus mode is that the energy spread of the primary electrons will be slightly increased due to the coulomb interaction between the electrons in the beam ( boersch effect ) .",
    "this also causes an increase of the minimum probe size due to the position of the cross - over @xcite .",
    "one of the novelties promised by the emcd technique is to obtain information about the magnetic properties of a sample with excellent spatial resolution .",
    "an impressive start for high resolution mapping of the magnetic properties was already obtained by using scanning tem ( stem ) techniques for emcd @xcite .",
    "the electron beam is focused to a nanometer - sized spot and is scanned over the sample ; the electrons scattered at high angles are recorded by a dark field detector to form an image , whereas the electrons scattered at low angles can be collected by the gif to record the emcd signal . in theory",
    "it is therefore possible to create a real space image of the dichroic signal pixel by pixel . in practice , a much longer acquisition time ( 10 - 30 seconds )",
    "is needed to collect a single eels spectrum with reasonable s / n ratio , compared to the few milliseconds usually needed for each pixel in a stem image .",
    "this makes it very difficult to obtain real space maps with a scanning technique because of specimen drift .",
    "it is however feasible to first acquire a normal stem image and use it to select where to record two sets of eels line scans ; from those the emcd signal can be obtained with high spatial resolution .",
    "this method has been used for obtaining an emcd line scan with a spatial resolution of 2 nm @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach is to use the energy filter with its energy selecting slit to record energy filtered tem images ( eftem ) from a large part of the sample at once .",
    "it has previously been suggested and tested for emcd but without success @xcite ; the intensity of the electron beam had been too low even for long acquisition times ( several minutes ) .",
    "the variations of the dark count of the ccd camera were greater than the eventual dichroic signal , so no meaningful data could be obtained .",
    "however , real space maps now become possible due to the increased intensity of the telefocus mode , as will be shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : results - realspacemaps ] .",
    "in this section the experimental set - up and data treatment used for reciprocal and real space maps is described in detail .",
    "the same procedure was used in ref .",
    "@xcite for analysing reciprocal space maps",
    ".      the top view sample preparation approach allowed us to choose a region on the sample with appropriate thickness , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sample ] . by collecting an electron energy - loss spectrum where a v signal starts to appear ( fe layer thickness 25  nm ) ,",
    "it is possible to experimentally calibrate the total mean free path of the inelastically scattered electrons  @xcite .",
    "the calibration is used to obtain the absolute thickness of the probed area using thickness maps .",
    "the sample was analyzed at places where the electrons transit only through the pure fe layer ( with al - capping ) , at a thickness of @xmath10 nm . images of the illumination spot on the sample were acquired before and after the series to verify that the sample did not drift during acquisition and to determine the size of the illuminated region .",
    "a relatively large beam size was chosen ( approximately 600 nm ) , averaging over many slightly misoriented grains .",
    "series of efdif patterns were acquired over the fe l@xmath11 edges from 750 ev to 670 ev using a slit width of 2 ev and a step size of 1 ev .",
    "an exposure time of 5 seconds per diffraction pattern ( hardware binning of 2 ) with a 3.0 mm spectrometer entrance aperture was used .",
    "a total acquisition time of approximately 20  minutes was required .",
    "the sample was tilted approximately @xmath12 from the high symmetry [ 001 ] orientation in order to reach the 3bc geometry .",
    "three - dimensional data sets , so called data cubes @xcite , are constructed from the acquired efdif patterns and represent the fast electron beam intensity as function of energy - loss and scattering vector : @xmath13 .",
    "the experimental data cubes consist of the ( @xmath14 ) diffraction planes stacked according to the energy - loss of the fast electrons , which represents the third dimension .",
    "eels spectra can easily be extracted from a data cube by selecting the same pixel or group of pixels in each efdif plane and plotting the beam intensity for those pixels as function of the energy - loss .",
    "the resulting spectrum is analogous to what would have been recorded in spectroscopy mode by placing a properly shaped aperture at that particular scattering vector ( @xmath14 ) and using an energy dispersion of 1 ev / channel .",
    "the advantage is that the ( virtual ) aperture size , shape and positions can be optimized _",
    "a posteriori_.    to analyze the emcd signal , the data cube was treated in the following way : a point blemish function removes bright spots arising from spurious radiation ; small shifts between the patterns are corrected with sub - pixel precision by cross - correlation @xcite ; the diffraction patterns are re - binned to 256 x 256 pixels ; then , the background under the fe edge is subtracted by extrapolating from a fit by a power - law model @xcite to the intensity in the pre - edge region .",
    "the point blemish removal was performed by calculating the mean value and standard deviation of the surroundings of every pixel .",
    "if the value of a pixel differed from the mean more than a pre - defined multiple of the standard deviation ( typical values were from 50 to 100 ; decided by inspection of the raw data ) , the pixel was replaced by the mean value . in normal eftem series , cross - correlation is needed to compensate for the sample drift during acquisition . in the case of efdif series , sample drift does not cause a drift of the diffraction pattern .",
    "however , as the primary electron energy is slowly changed to perform the efdif series , the software automatically changes the microscope settings to keep the illumination stable by adjusting to the change in accelerating voltage .",
    "small fluctuation in the beam , lenses or software compensation may lead to a drift of the diffraction pattern .",
    "the cross - correlation routine is therefore applied by selecting only the transmitted beam to align all efdif patterns ( typically shifts of less than three pixels within a cube ) .      where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the amplitude and position in energy of the l@xmath11 peaks , respectively .",
    "the lorentzian - gaussian mixing ratio ( a ) , asymmetry ( @xmath3 ) and the width ( 2@xmath19 fwhm ) are assumed to be the same for the l@xmath11 peaks . for the background , @xmath20 describes its amplitude while @xmath21 the steepness of the @xmath22 function .",
    "thus , a total of nine fitting parameters were used here .",
    "since the spectra are fitted independently , each fitting parameter is a function of ( @xmath14 ) that can be illustrated by a reciprocal space map .",
    "the experimental dichroic maps are obtained by using the integrated intensity under the fitted @xmath15 edges and an appropriate mirror axis .",
    "this approach considers the entire signal strength in the @xmath15 edges , it removes the arbitrariness of the energy interval selection @xcite for separating the @xmath23 and @xmath24 components and also reduces the influence of peak shifts ( due to the non - isochromaticity of the energy filter ) on the emcd signal .",
    "the resulting diffraction patterns from the peak fitting of the @xmath15 areas were rotated in order to apply a mirror axis for the extraction of the emcd signal .",
    "the angle of rotation was obtained by first adding all diffraction patterns in the cross correlated data cube ( typically 80 ) , finding the center of the diffracted spots in this resulting pattern and from there determine the rotation angle .",
    "it should be noted that the emcd signal itself might slightly move the bragg spots perpendicularly to the systematic row .",
    "our calculations have shown that in this experimental set - up , the positions of the diffracted spots are found to move less than 0.01@xmath25 for sample thicknesses above 20 nm . only for specimen thicknesses below 10",
    "nm the spots move at most 0.02@xmath25 , therefore neglected here .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath1 ratio for a sample is a material property , independent of diffraction geometry .",
    "nevertheless , in experimental setups the assumptions of sum rules about symmetrical detector positions @xcite are often not exactly fulfilled , either due to inherent asymmetry of 2bc @xcite or due to misalignments in orienting the sample to 3bc geometry .",
    "therefore the value of the @xmath1 ratio extracted by direct application of the sum rules can deviate from the value of the material property , and can also vary throughout the diffraction plane . to keep this distinction - material property vs. value obtained by sum rules - in the further text we refer to the latter as _ apparent _ @xmath1 ratio .",
    "first principles simulations provide information , how much the apparent @xmath1 ratio differs from the material property ( see sec .  [ sec : theory - sr - evalmlms ] ) . by using reciprocal space maps we are able to evaluate how the apparent @xmath1 ratio varies due to asymmetry and noise with ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the @xmath1 ratio can , according to the sum rules @xcite , be calculated from : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the difference between the eels - spectra extracted at the two specific detector positions with opposite magnetic contribution as defined by the selected mirror axis .",
    "a map of the apparent @xmath1 ratio is thus obtained by applying eq .",
    "[ eq : ls ] to the peak fitted data cube .",
    "the reciprocal space maps allow for optimization of the position , shape and size of the extraction region in reciprocal space for obtaining reliable @xmath1 ratio values , since every pixel of the map acts as an individual measurement .",
    "therefore , the s / n ratio can be optimized by selecting regions in the apparent @xmath1 ratio maps where the emcd signal is found to be strongest .",
    "the histogram of these @xmath1 ratios for a specific size of the window in reciprocal space was fitted using a gaussian function .",
    "the size of the bins used in the histogram was optimized to best reflect the distribution of @xmath1 data according to ref .",
    "@xcite ; revealing a typical bin size of approximately 0.1 .",
    "although , if the bin size is slightly changed , the resulting @xmath1 ratio does not show a significant change ( less than the given uncertainty @xmath28 ) .",
    "the method of peak fitting the histogram was chosen in order to reduce the influence of outliers and thereby get a more reliable quantification of the maps , compared to , _",
    "e.g. _ , the mean value .",
    "the center of the gaussian has a fit error of only @xmath29 in @xmath1 .",
    "it should be noted that this error estimation considers the extraction of values from the obtained @xmath1 map .",
    "however , additional errors are present in the peak fitting process , which is more difficult to assess .",
    "more fit parameters do not necessary lead to a more accurate fit , wherefore assumptions and simplifications were applied as described above . when having poor energy resolution ( here 1 - 2 ev ) there is a tangible risk of introducing fitting artefacts as a result of too few data points .",
    "particularly , the @xmath1 ratio appears to be most sensitive to the description of the double - step background .",
    "various types of functions for the continuum transition background are used in xmcd such as arctangent , error function , voigt or even linear .",
    "the origin of the double step background is however questioned , since it does not show with the same strength in calculations , but it is often described to originate from @xmath30 to @xmath31 transitions .",
    "thus , currently no model exists , neither for emcd nor xmcd , to accurately predict it .",
    "further studies are therefore needed in order to understand its influence on both techniques . however , as dichroic measurements rely on the difference between spectra , the influence of the background is therefore reduced .      as indicated in sec .",
    "[ sec : micsettings ] , the strongly increased intensity of the electron beam in telefocus mode allows for real space maps of the emcd signal .",
    "a region of the sample was oriented in a 3bc geometry , exciting @xmath32 = ( @xmath9200 ) reflections in fe . to have good control over the orientation of the sample , single efdif patterns and dark field ( df ) images",

    "was then shifted to the second thales circle position to obtain the spectra with opposite magnetic contribution , by acquiring a second data cube of eftem images .",

    "[ sec : experimentreciprocalmaps ] .",
    "first a point blemish function was used to remove noisy spots from spurious radiation .",
    "the images were cross correlated @xcite by selecting a characteristic feature on the sample that was visible throughout both cubes . since the emcd signal will be obtained by taking the difference between the two data cubes , any drift between them must also be removed . to do this , all images in each",
    "individually cross correlated data cube were added together ( typically 80 images each ) and the two resulting images were cross correlated ; the resulting drift correction was then applied to the data cubes .",

    "dynamical diffraction effects determine the distribution of the dichroic signal throughout the diffraction plane and its thickness dependence .",
    "the energy dependence is then determined by the matrix elements of inelastic transitions ( described in sec .",
