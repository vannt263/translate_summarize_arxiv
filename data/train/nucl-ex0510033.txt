    "in a relativistic heavy ion collision an extended hot and dense matter is formed . at such a state",
    ", it is expected that nuclear matter goes through a phase transition from a confined ( hadronic ) matter to a de - confined phase or quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "the studies of hadronic resonance with extremely short lifetimes ( @xmath13few fm / c ) have the unique characteristics to probe the hadron production and the collision dynamics through their decays and re - generation . in the hot and dense matter ,",
    "resonances and their hadronic decay daughters undergo re - scattering and re - generation , which affects various resonance properties such as yields , masses , widths and also in the modification in the observed momentum distributions of the resonances @xcite .",
    "resonances with higher @xmath7 have a greater chance to be detected than the ones with lower @xmath7 .",
    "that means higher momentum resonances leave the medium very fast and decay outside the medium , hence their daughter particles interact less with the medium @xcite",
    ". the effect of re - scattering of the decayed daughters from resonances can destroy part of the primordial resonance yields . on the other hand",
    ", hadrons can interact with each other inside the medium and can enhance the primordial resonance yields @xcite .",
    "thus , measuring the resonance yields and their ratios with respect to the corresponding stable particles in heavy ion collisions , compared to the same in @xmath14 collisions , can provide the information about hadronization and the dynamics between the chemical and kinetic freeze - outs and possible medium effects .",
    "in this report we present some results of the above mentioned study , through the production of @xmath5 and @xmath15 resonance in @xmath3+au collision data taken by the star ( solenoidal tracker at rhic ) experiment in 2002 - 2003 rhic run .",
    "comparing the results from @xmath3+au collisions with the same from @xmath14 and au+au collisions will enables us to understand the in - medium effects .",
    "in the present analysis , the @xmath5 and @xmath15 resonances signals were measured via their hadronic decay channels @xmath16 @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 in @xmath3+au collisions at @xmath4 = 200 gev .",
    "the main tracking device in the star experiment is the tpc @xcite , which provides both the momentum information and the particle identification of the charged particles by measuring their ionization energy loss ( @xmath22 ) in the tpc .",
    "the minimum bias trigger was defined by requiring at least one beam - rapidity neutron in the zero degree calorimeter ( zdc ) in the au beam direction , which is assigned the negative pseudorapidity ( @xmath23 ) @xcite .",
    "the centrality of the @xmath3+au collisions was determined by the charged particle multiplicity ( @xmath24 ) within a pseudorapidity window of -3.8 @xmath25 -2.8 was measured by the forward tpc ( ftpc ) along the au beam direction .",
    "the @xmath3+au centrality definition consists of three event centrality classes ; 0 - 20% , 20 - 40% and 40 - 100% of the total @xmath3+au inelastic cross section . in this analysis",
    ", about 11.7 m and 15 m @xmath3+au minimum bias events have been used for @xmath5 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "= 4.cm = 3.cm    = 4.cm = 3.cm    the @xmath5 and @xmath15 invariant mass spectra are reconstructed using the event - mixing technique @xcite .",
    "figure 1 , shows the invariant mass spectra for @xmath5 and @xmath15 , fitted with the @xmath26-wave breit - wigner function times the phase space factor ( bw @xmath27 ps ) and a residual background function @xcite . for @xmath5 case",
    "the residual background is described by a gaussian function , whereas for @xmath15 case it is described by a linear function .",
    "= 3.cm    on the left panel of the fig.2 , one can see there is a mass shift for both @xmath28 and @xmath29 at lower @xmath7 bins .",
    "it is about 10 mev / c@xmath30 less compared to the standard particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite value for @xmath31 0.9 gev / c .",
    "the resonances produced with low @xmath7 spent more time inside the medium than the high @xmath7 resonances , resulting in a modification in their masses .",
    "the high @xmath7 resonances leave the medium very fast and do nt get modified . on the right panel shows the @xmath5 mass distribution for 0.2 @xmath32 1.6 gev / c . which shows the clear mass shift on the average up to about 50 mev / c@xmath30 observed .",
    "the relatively smaller reconstructed masses compared to the standard value may be attributed to the momentum loss from the re - scattering of decayed daughters .",
    "= 3.cm    in fig.3 , the width has been plotted as a function of @xmath7 for both @xmath15 and @xmath5 . on the left panels of the figure",
    "we do nt see any difference between the width of @xmath28 and @xmath29 from their pdg value .",
    "the right panel shows an increase in @xmath5 width with increase in @xmath7 , excepting the last @xmath7 bin , which is expected to be because of dynamical cut effects .",
    "= 3.cm    from the fit to the invariant mass spectra , the @xmath5 and @xmath15 raw yield has been extracted and corrected for efficiency and acceptance .",
    "figure 4 shows the corrected @xmath7 spectra for @xmath5 and @xmath6 for minimum bias as well as for different collision centralities . from the fitting to the @xmath7 spectra one can get the resonance yield ( @xmath33 ) at mid - rapidity and the inverse slope parameter @xmath34 for @xmath5 and @xmath15 for @xmath3+au collisions @xcite .",
    "= 4.5 cm    as has been discussed earlier , the resonances having higher @xmath7 have greater probability to be detected than the low @xmath7 ones , thus we expect higher mean transverse momentum ( @xmath10 ) values in heavy ion collisions than in elementary collisions , such as @xmath14 collisions @xcite . in the left panel of fig.5 , one can see , the @xmath10 values for @xmath15 increase with centrality and higher than the same obtained from @xmath14 collisions at same center of mass energy , whereas there is no centrality dependence observed in au+au collisions @xcite . in the same figure for the case of @xmath5 , there is a slight increase in @xmath10 as we go from peripheral to central collisions .",
    "the middle panel of the fig.5 , we can see that the @xmath35 ratios in @xmath3+au and au+au collisions are significantly smaller than the same in @xmath14 collisions .",
    "the @xmath35 ratio suppression may indicate that between the chemical and kinetic freeze - out , @xmath15 signals are predominantly destroyed due to the re - scattering of daughter particles which can not be compensated by the re - generation effect .",
    "where as for @xmath36 ratios do nt show any centrality dependence in @xmath3+au collisions .",
    "the right panel of the fig.5 shows the nuclear modification factor @xmath12 and @xmath11 for @xmath5 and @xmath15 as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath11 values are less than unity at low @xmath7 region . but @xmath12 and @xmath11 close to unity at @xmath37 1.5 gev / c for both @xmath5 and @xmath15 .",
    "the lower value of @xmath11 for low @xmath7 region seem to be a result of re - scattering of daughter particles inside the medium .",
    "the preliminary results on @xmath5 and @xmath15 resonances measured using the tpc in star experiment at mid - rapidity in @xmath3+au collisions at @xmath4 are reported .",
    "the downward mass shift ( @xmath13 10 mev ) observed at lower @xmath7 bins are observed for @xmath15 and there is a clear mass shift ( up to @xmath13 50 mev ) observed for @xmath5 resonance over all @xmath7 bins .",
    "the observed @xmath35 ratios in @xmath3+au collisions are significantly smaller than that for @xmath14 collisions . on the other hand @xmath9 ratios in @xmath3au collisions",
    "are independent of centrality .",
    "the @xmath10 for @xmath15 in @xmath3au collisions is higher than the same obtained from @xmath14 collisions , in agreement with @xmath7-dependence of daughter particles re - scattering effect .",
    "the nuclear modification factor is close to unity for both @xmath5 and @xmath15 resonaces at @xmath37 1.5 gev / c .",
