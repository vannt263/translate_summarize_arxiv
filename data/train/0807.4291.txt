    "the number of fundamental fermion generations is not predicted by the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "this number is restricted from below with lep i data on invisible decays of z boson as @xmath4 @xcite . on the other hand , the asymptotic freedom of qcd",
    "enforces the number of generations to be less than 9 .",
    "the recent precision electroweak data are equally consistent with existence of three or four sm generations @xcite .",
    "the flavor democracy is a natural hypothesis in the framework of sm as well as a number of models dealing with new physics ( see review @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the flavor democracy hypothesis in sm predicts the existence of the fourth sm generation @xcite .",
    "tevatron experiments give @xmath5 gev of lower bound on the mass of the fourth generation quarks @xcite .",
    "however it does not fix the masses and mixings of the new fermions .",
    "another prediction of the flavor democracy is the masses of the fourth generation fermions to be nearly degenerate and lie between 300 and 700 gev , whereas , the masses of known fermions belonging to lighter three generations appear due to small deviations of the democracy @xcite .",
    "the last value is close to the upper limit on heavy quark masses , which follows from partial - wave unitary at high energies @xcite .",

    "a new era in high energy physics will be opened with the construction of tev scale colliders @xcite .",
    "obviously , tev energy colliders are needed for discovery of the fourth sm generation fermions .",
    "the first of the such colliders is the large hadron collider ( lhc ) with 14 tev center of mass energy .",
    "the fourth generation quarks is predicted to be copiously produced in pairs at the lhc @xcite .",
    "recently , this process is proposed as the best scenario ( after higgs ) for discovery at the lhc @xcite .",
    "also , a serious contributions of anomalous interactions for the production of the fourth generation fermions can be expected .",
    "such anomalous interactions seems to be quite natural due to large masses of the fourth generation fermions ( see argumentation for anomalous interaction for t quark presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . these anomalous interactions could provide also single production of the fourth generation fermions .",
    "the anomalous single production of the fourth generation fermions is considered in a number of papers @xcite . recently , anomalous production of the fourth generation charged lepton and neutrino at future ep colliders is considered in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "this paper is devoted to study the anomalous single production of the fourth generation up and down type quarks at the lhc .    in section ii the lagrangian for sm and the anomalous interactions of the fourth generation quarks",

    "productions of the fourth generation quarks at the lhc are studied in section iii : @xmath6 ( and its h.c . ) and @xmath7 processes as well as their sm backgrounds are considered .",
    "the statistical significance of the signal and achievable values of anomalous coupling strength are given with concluding remarks in section iv .",
    "the effective lagrangian for the anomalous interactions of @xmath8 and @xmath9 quarks can be rewritten from @xcite with minor modifications as :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 denotes the generation index .",

    "gev . naturally , these values are too small with respect to the background as can be seen from fig",
    "main reason for the low values of the signal cross section is the initial mixing value between @xmath8 and @xmath34 given by parametrization used . in the parametrization , @xmath35 takes values from 0.0017 for @xmath32 gev to 0.0008 for @xmath33 gev . without experimental data it is not possible to know the correct ckm matrix .",
