    "in recent years , the use of field elliptical galaxies has become a conventional tool for testing between very different structures of formation , where the main competing views of galaxy formation at high and low redshift are often referred as monolithic or early formation and hierarchical or late formation @xcite .",
    "many observational studies have been devoted to study a number of `` scaling relations '' in ellipticals in rich clusters ; i.e. the low scatter in the fundamental plane @xcite and in the color - magnitude relation ( cmr ) @xcite .",
    "these imply a high degree of homogeneity in the stellar population which reinforced the idea of a monolithic collapse model in which ellipticals formed during a rapid collapse at high redshift @xcite .",
    "the simple view of early formation contrasts with the predictions of models where galaxies assemble hierarchically as the result of the merging of smaller sub - units , at a rate governed by the merger of cold dark matter halos @xcite . although the prevailing view in the past was that ellipticals in the field formed in isolation in a high - redshift initial burst of formation , as did their clustered counterparts , several authors have shown that the observational properties of field spheroids ( collectively e and s0s ) are incompatible with the bulk of the population forming at high redshift @xcite .",
    "most of these studies were prompted by the success of hierarchical models in the predictions of a large quantity of observable properties of galaxies , suggesting that massive field ellipticals could only have been assembled recently ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the general consensus that arose is that a single short period of formation at high redshift is incompatible with the observations .",
    "there is growing evidence of the existence of blue spheroids with perturbed colors at intermediate redshift and a deficit of red systems compared to monolithic models predictions @xcite .",
    "more recently , however , @xcite have reported using a large sample of hst galaxies that e / s0s dominate the red - sequence of galaxies at @xmath7 .",
    "as the outcome of these new studies a new view of elliptical formation is emerging .",
    "a surprising result from this wave of studies is the existence of field spheroids with blue central regions at intermediate redshifts @xmath8 .",
    "these objects were originally detected from their color maps ( @xcite ; @xcite ) in the _ hubble deep fields _",
    "( hdfs ) , and are suggestive of recent star - formation activity associated to central region of the galaxy . the presence of blue core spheroids in the hdfs has generated interest in reproducing their observed properties using both semi - analytic models @xcite and extended monolithic collapse ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the hierarchical description of @xcite accurately predicts the number of spheroids and the degree of color variations observed in spheroids , but misses most of the red spheroids in the sample . on the other hand multi - zone chemo",
    "- dynamical models can predict the existence of blue cores and homogeneous colors of evolved ellipticals with success , by adjusting the redshift of formation of the galaxy , although the cosmological mechanisms responsible for detailing the formation of spheroids are somewhat unclear .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* for examples ) supplies a new set of independent constraints to the traditional use of counts and redshift distributions alone , particularly useful when attempting to discriminate between models of elliptical formation .",
    "moreover , it is appealing to examine independent spheroid samples that look for galaxies with color inhomogeneities like those reported in the hdfs .",
    "over larger datasets , they can provide important clues for determining the fraction of spheroids still experiencing star formation .",
    "unfortunately , until the arrival of the acs , resolved colors analysis have been limited only to superb signal - to - noise and highly time consuming datasets such as the hdfs . in this paper we explore the advantages arising from exploiting the unprecedented capabilities of the acs in obtaining hdf - like datasets with only a fraction of the integration time .",

    "this is our starting point for segregating early - types .",
    "we decided on selecting objects brighter than @xmath25 the same criteria adopted by @xcite in the hdfs as this enables both reliable morphological classification and abundant signal - to - noise pixel information on deep hst images and will provide us with the right tools to compare with the hdfs sample later .",
    "this lead us to an initial sample of 373 objects .",
    "we employ the same procedure for selecting spheroids as described in @xcite and @xcite based on a combination of visual classification and machine morphological analysis .",
    "stars were initially removed using the sextractor star class parameter in addition to visual inspection of all objects in the sample . here , we briefly summarize the strategy taken and refer the reader to these works for a full description of the methodology used .",
    "galaxies in the tadpole field were morphologically classified using an automated classification based on both the central concentration _ ( c ) _ and asymmetry _ ( a ) _ parameters ( _ a  c _ ) from @xcite , as well as using visual classifications made by one of us ( fm ) . visual classification have been shown to agree very well with _ a  c _ classes in previous studies @xcite .",
    "the segregation of early - type systems is particularly robust as their chief diagnostic parameter for discrimination is central concentration .",
    "it is worth noting the key advantage in adding _ a  c _ to visual classes alone , as they represent objective measurements of the morphological properties of galaxies and can be modeled and easily reproduced in the future if required . in building our final sample of spheroids",
    "we used a combined criteria of using both _ a - c _ and visual classes , which we believe is a robust approach . in figure",
    "[ fig : ac ] we compare the _ a - c _ values computed for galaxies keyed to their visual classes in three broad categories : e / s0 , spiral and irregular .",
    "we selected spheroid galaxies as objects which were visually classified as e , e / s0 and s0 in the hubble scheme .",
    "when there were discrepancies between visual classes and _ a  c _ , they were examined in detail , to ensure an unbiased selection . in this fashion",
    "we constructed a final catalog containing 116 acs spheroids , which is @xmath26 larger than the only other hst existing catalog ; the hdfs fields with 79 spheroids .      despite the absence of spectroscopic information for galaxies in the tadpole field",
    ", we enhance the sample with the photometric redshift estimates computed using the bayesian photometric redshift package ( bpz ) @xcite included in the apsis pipeline products .",
    "bpz follows a bayesian statistical approach to estimate redshifts employing a set of galaxy templates and magnitude - redshift priors . while it is often assumed that several filters are necessary to achieve accurate measurements , the addition of priors can lead to reliable redshifts with only the f475w , f606w and f814w filters .",
    "as described in @xcite , when the bayesian methodology is calibrated with the northern hdf ( hdf - n ) spectroscopic sample , it has an excellent behavior at @xmath27 , without catastrophic outliers and much better performance than maximum likelihood alone .",
    "furthermore , according to @xcite , simulations of the efficiency of the photometric redshifts as a function of magnitude confirmed that for bright objects , @xmath28 the tipical uncertainties are , which coincides with the magnitude limit set for our sample where photometric estimates are most reliable .",
    "despite the small estimated errors , we opt to take the safer approach of using the photometric redshift only over the integrated properties of the sample rather than those of individual galaxies .",
    "understanding the behavior of the point - spread function ( psf ) becomes important when studying distant objects at pixel - scales . in the present analysis",
    "our main concern is that psf variations as a function of wavelength may lead to spurious centrally concentrated inhomogeneities arising from some centrally concentrated profiles in some spheroids . to study this effect we made extensive simulations of the effect of the psf by artificially creating spheroids which were subsequently analyzed using the same method applied to the observed data .",
    "these are presented in appendix  [ app : psf ] .",
    "we conclude that the effect of the psf will not significantly influence any of the indicators used in our analysis .    prompted by the findings of spheroids with central blue cores in the hdfs @xcite , the first step in our analysis is to construct @xmath29 color maps for all the ellipticals in our sample .",
    "this color peculiarity has only been reported for early - types in the hdfs so far , and it is compelling to verify whether it will also be present in other unrelated samples such us the current one . for this , we compute pixel maps , surface brightness , @xmath30 , for all galaxies in all three bands , using the well - known transformation , @xmath31 where zp is the zero - point for a given filter in the vega system from table  [ tab : zero ] , the pixelscale is 0.05 arc / pixel and counts is the number of electrons in each pixel .",
    "subsequently , color maps were computed , selecting only contiguous pixels above a surface brightness threshold of .",
    "we note that we use this surface brightness limit only in the computation of in section  [ sec : dvi ] in order to maintain consistency when comparing with previous observations .",
    "however in section  [ sec : slope ] we will discusss a more robust method for selecting and measuring the light of spheroids .",
    "our first objective is finding a population of spheroids with blue cores and inhomogeneous internal colors in the current acs sample mirroring those found in the hdfs .",
    "after an initial inspection , we conclude that in most cases spheroids show fairly smooth and homogeneous color maps , but the existence of a subsample with perturbed internal colors is quite evident .",
    "we report a fraction of spheroids with blue cores comparable to the hdfs in our acs sample , with similar sizes and strength in their color differences .",
    "it is important to remark that this is the first sample , apart from the hdfs in which resolved studies of distant galaxies are possible . to illustrate the similarities in our findings , in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] , we show examples of spheroids with normal and peculiar internal color properties in the hdf - n and the present sample of acs spheroids .",
    "the similarities in the form of the blue nucleated ones in both samples are quite evident .",
    "after considering the color maps of spheroids , we want to investigate how the internal colors of field ellipticals vary as a function of redshift and quantify the fraction that departs from a passive evolving population .",
    "although we can identify a distinctive population of spheroids with blue cores and color inhomogeneities from visual inspections alone , we wish to develop a method for quantifying its strength in an objective way .",
    "a standard tool for this purpose is to model their color properties using stellar synthesis population models @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these predictions are quite sensitive to the galaxy redshift of observation and our present sample only encompass photometric estimates , making this approach toward characterizing individual galaxies somewhat uncertain .",
    "instead we chose to explore a model - free approach and focus on the integrated properties , which in our view represent a safer way to evaluate the trend of the population .",
    "for this purpose we revisit the internal color dispersion estimator from @xcite and devise a new measurement based on the slope of the color gradients of a galaxy that we will show is more sensitive to the presence of central blue spots .",
    "the idea of studying the internal colors of an individual galaxy can be considered as a generalization of the use of the color - magnitude relation in the study of the history of elliptical galaxies in clusters @xcite , where the photometric dispersion is employed as a powerful mechanism to determine variations in their star formation history .",
    "the first quantity that we present is the signal - to - noise weighted scatter in the internal colors of a galaxy , , as defined in @xcite .",
    "this measurement has proven a good tracer of peculiarities in spheroid colors at pixel scales in the sense that objects with low values of  have very uniform and normal color maps , while those with higher values do present disturbed internal colors and in many cases blue cores .",
    "a key motivation for re - visiting this estimator is that it has already been applied and calibrated with a similarly selected sample of galaxies in the hdfs , where it proved to be a good discriminant of objects with blue cores vs ellipticals with normal colors .",
    "this feature enable us to make direct comparison between the hdfs sample  measurements and the current one .",
    "in addition , it is a model independent method for studying differences in the star - formation histories of galaxies , making it free of assumptions regarding the epoch of formation in ellipticals .    in our estimates of",
    ", we follow the same procedure used in the hdfs , and we also chose to concentrate only on the and bands for computing color dispersions , as the resulting color contains significantly smaller observational errors than , specially for systems dominated by old stellar populations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) . however , it is important to note that strong variations in the internal colors are also present when looking at the the colors .",
    "we select all contiguous pixels within a surface brightness limit of in @xmath32 , to isolate the galaxy from the background sky and maximize the s / n ratio per pixel associated . using only the pixels within this limit ,",
    "is computed from the weighted signal - to - noise distribution of colors for individual pixels , which in turn identifies the internal homogeneity of a galaxy , using the following recipe : @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a selection function for pixels with signal / noise above a certain threshold such that @xmath36 for pixels above and @xmath37 for pixel below the threshold .",
    "@xmath38 is the signal - to - noise ratio for a given pixel color @xmath39 .",
    "the selection function @xmath35 and the weighting according to @xmath40 address biases arising from noise variations at pixel - scales by rejecting low signal pixels and weighting the pixels contribution proportionally to their signal .",
    "in addition to the color dispersion we wish to develop an alternative quantity to isolate spheroids with non - homogeneous internal colors .",
    "this should be suited to measure the strength of the blue cores and not prone to dispersions arising from particularly reddened core . for this",
    "we concentrate on a method that quantifies the variation in the color as a function of the galaxy radius . given that in most of the cases , color peculiarities manifest themselves via the presence of blue cores , a clear pattern of this effect is the display of inverted ( i.e. positive sign ) color gradient , as opposed to `` normal '' passively evolving ellipticals which either show flat or slightly negative color gradients , as expected from metal enriched cores .",
    "we focus on the colors to compute color gradients as a function of the radius @xmath41 , as these represent the bands where the signal - to - noise is higher and can be more directly related to . in the extraction of the color gradients , initially we measure the centroid and second order moments ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) of the galaxy utilizing the @xmath45 band , from which we determine the ellipticity parameters of the objects ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that we keep the same elongation ratio @xmath47 up to the isophotal limit to which the color gradient is computed .",
    "next , using concentric ellipses , we calculate the @xmath48 gradients as the median color in the shell between @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "to gauge the slope of the color gradient , we fit a fourth order polynomial function to the observed , up to a certain maximum radius @xmath51 , from where we measure the slope by simply obtaining the first derivative of the fitted polynomial function . in order to consistenly measure the slope of galaxies over similar physical areas on spheroids and at different redshifts ,",
    "we compute the slope up to a radius @xmath51 following a similar aproach to the one described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this consists of choosing the aperture radius @xmath51 of the galaxy as @xmath52 with @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the @xcite radius and @xmath55 is defined as : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the surface brightness of the galaxy in an annulus of radius @xmath41 and @xmath58 is its mean value up to the same radius .",
    "the petrosian radius depends only on the galaxy surface brightness and it is independent of the redshift of observation .",
    "formally , the mean  slope of the galaxy can be expressed as : @xmath59 where the derivative is taken over the fitted function , @xmath60 is the size of the concentric shells and @xmath41 is measured in kpc .",
    "we repeat this procedure to all the galaxies in our sample . in section",
    "[ sec : results ] we will investigate how it performs compared with  and present examples .      an important objective of our analysis , is to carry out direct comparisons of the internal color dispersions between the present acs sample and those observed in the hdfs . for this purpose",
    ", we will include in our study the morphologically selected catalog of spheroids in hdf - n from @xcite .",
    "the hdf - n sample was constructed using the same selection limits and morphological classification , ensuring a robust comparison between samples .",
    "we decide to include only the northern hdf as this contains the largest number of spectroscopic redshifts , making possible an investigation of how the internal color dispersions vary as a function of redshift as opposed to the photometric estimates in acs spheroids .",
    "after computing  and the mean slope for all galaxies in the acs and hdf - n samples we examine how they perform against each other and subsequently compare with hdf - n spheroids .",
    "figure  [ fig : slope - dvi ] shows the values of  versus the mean slope  for all spheroids in the tadpole field .",
    "we can observe a clear correlation between both statistics for the larger part of the sample : galaxies with high positive mean slopes ( indicative of blue cores ) also show high values of  ( i.e. high internal color dispersions ) .",
    "although the inverse relation is true for most galaxies ( i.e high color dispersion values ( @xmath61 ) also have high positive slopes ) we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : slope - dvi ] that several high  galaxies have flat or even negative slopes in some cases .",
    "this results as galaxies with metal enriched cores tend to have redder centers , making their mean slopes slightly negative or flat , while keeping higher than normal values of . from fig .",
    "[ fig : slope - dvi ] , we wish to highlight that the mean slope  is a more robust statistic for tracing blue cores as spheroids with positive slopes and hence blue cores exhibit high internal color dispersion .",
    "also in fig .",
    "[ fig : slope - dvi ] we present the values computed for the hdf - n spheroids .",
    "it is reassuring that ellipticals populate the same region in the median slope space for both samples .",
    "after individually inspecting the objects with high  values but low or negative slopes , we confirm that these correspond to objects with reddened cores .",
    "we conclude that although both statistics succeed in tracing the observed color variations , the mean slope is a more robust statistic for tracing blue light in spheroids and is not prone to color differences arising from color gradients normally accounted for in passively evolved ellipticals .",
    "establishing the existence of a population of field spheroids with marked color dispersions , resembling those exhibited by hdfs spheroids is a major objective of this paper . from the constructed color maps",
    "alone we can conclude that this is a property shared by field spheroids at intermediate redshifts regardless of the sample in study .",
    "the presence of strong variations in the internal color distributions suggests episodes of recent start - formation activity .",
    "however , detailed measurements regarding the intensity and timescales involved requires precise spectroscopic information , not available for the sample in our study .",
    "instead , we opt to determine in a model - independent way the proportion of active systems as a function of redshift and based on this information , make educated guesses regarding the evolution of early - type galaxies .",

    "error bars represent @xmath62 estimates obtained using the bootstrap resampling technique introduced by @xcite . from figure",
    "[ fig : redshift - dvi ] we observe how the fraction of spheroids with high values slightly increases as a function of redshift in the same way as reported for hdf - n spheroids .",
    "we make a quantitative measurement and focus on the fraction of systems with high values compared to low ones as this measurement is not prone to selection effects due to the redshift distribution of spheroids in our sample .",
    "we separate the sample into two redshift bins , such as @xmath63 and @xmath64 and calculate the fraction of spheroids with @xmath65 to the total number .",
    "we report an increase from 28% in @xmath66 to 39% in @xmath67 .",
    "however , we point out that this might also be consistent with no increase given the relatively small number of objects involved .    it is reassuring to confirm that both samples show a very similar trend in the observed spread as well as its increase with redshift . assuming that in most cases high values of  are associated with recent star formation activity within the galaxy , the rise of  with redshift indicates a clear trend in this sense . for the hdfs , @xcite have computed simple models that can explain the existence of galaxies with high  as the result of small additional bursts of star formation activity .    if we assume that strong internal color dispersion are indeed associated with recent star formation , it is interesting to obtain the fraction of evolving systems as a function of redshift .",
    "as observed from figure  [ fig : slope - dvi ] , the mean slope  is better suited to probe blue cores and internal inhomogeneities than @xmath68 , therefore we choose to use this instead of  for estimating the ratio of spheroids with strong internal color variations to the total number of objects . in figure",
    "[ fig : redshift - slope ] we show computed values of the mean slope  as a function of redshift for both the tadpole field and the hdf - n sample , using the same symbols as in figure  [ fig : redshift - dvi ] . for completeness",
    "we also display the values for the hdf - n , as this allows to make consistency checks for variations that could arise between samples , in part due to the use of photometric redshifts .",

    "we also show two galaxies of contrasting internal colors and the very distinctive values of the mean slope they have .",
    "it is interesting to note from this figure how galaxies tend to populate rather uniformly the redshift space .      in order to reliably make use of the mean slope  in tracing blue light in spheroids , we need to investigate its variation as a function of redshift introduced from measuring the mean slope using the and filters .",
    "we attempt to reproduce through simulations the observed spatially resolved color properties of spheroids with blue nuclei .",
    "our key assumption when modeling these spheroids is that at intermediate redshifts they can be described using a two component model : a young stellar central component ( responsible for the blue light ) superimposed on an old system .",
    "we modeled the integrated colors of both stellar component using spectral energy distributions ( sed ) from the bruzual & charlot ( 1996 ) ( bc96 ) library .",
    "for the old stellar component we chose an sed corresponding to exponentially declining star formation ( @xmath69-folding time @xmath70  gyr ) at age @xmath10  gyr , which resembles the colors of a normal elliptical at @xmath71 .",
    "for the central region we employ the sed of a recent star - forming elliptical as observed after @xmath70  gyr since its formation . for each component",

    "[ fig : redshift - slope ] ) we created artificial ellipticals from the two components using a customized version of the iraf package artdata .",
    "we used a fixed physical size of half - light radius @xmath77  kpc for a de vaucouleurs profile for the old component .",
    "we assume that the blue central component corresponds to only @xmath78 of the total stellar mass of the galaxy @xmath79 , as this supplies enough blue light to reproduce the observed blue colors , and effective radius of @xmath80 .    for the resulting artificial galaxies we compute the mean slope between @xmath81 using the same procedure as for the real data .",
    "we show the results of the exercise in figure  [ fig : redshift - slope ] .",
    "the solid line represents the computed values of the mean slope  recovered from the simulations .",
    "we observe that for simulated spheroids the mean slope changes little as a function of redshift , with a bump at @xmath82 which coincides with the peak in the @xmath83 colors difference between both components .",
    "we conclude that although our filter set is more favorable to trace blue light near @xmath84 , the variations as a function of redshift are small enough that this will not significantly affect our results .      when computing the active to total galaxies ratio , we need to calibrate the mean slope  to differentiate between active versus passively evolved systems",
    ". certainly high values of the mean slope are directly linked to large internal color variations , and for the high mean slope vs. redshift envelope , is where undoubtedly the most striking cases of blue cores arise .",
    "on the other hand , galaxies with small values , near zero or negative show no significant color variations .",
    "however , defining a limit that separate active vs passive systems is a rather uncertain and imprecise exercise . to assess this problem , we opt for interactively calibrating this limit , by visually inspecting all galaxies and their respective color maps . after extensive inspections ,",
    "we resolve to chose a constant limit of mean slope  @xmath85 mags@xmath86kpc@xmath23 as a fiducial limit , that produces the cleanest separation ( fig .",

    "using this limit we proceed and compute the fraction of active to total spheroids as a function of redshift for all the ellipticals in the tadpole field up to @xmath87 . in order to avoid possible uncertainties arising from normal poisson variations and the use of photometric redshifts",
    ", we opt for binning out the data using redshift bins of size @xmath88 , wide enough to smooth out major noise variations . in figure",

    "were estimated by carrying out monte carlo simulations over the distributions . to estimate the uncertainties we recompute the histogram @xmath89 times ( @xmath90 ) in which the redshift of observation of the galaxies is modified such as @xmath91 , in which @xmath92 is a randomly generated number between @xmath93 $ ] and @xmath94 is the nominal error estimation of bpz equal to @xmath95 .    from figure  [ fig : fraction ]",
    "we report that the fraction of active spheroids is compatible with constant as a function of redshift ( within the error bars ) .",
    "it is important to notice that the estimate for the lowest redshift bin , is quite uncertain as indicated by the large error bars , as the tadpole sample is incomplete for lower redshift galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "regarding the actual amount of the fraction of active spheroidals , we recognize that its absolute value is rather dependent in the limit used for selection .",
    "however , for the current limit adopted , this number mostly fluctuates around @xmath96 in good agreement with the values obtained for the hdf - n for @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is also worth noting that from tests performed on the sample , the shape of fraction distribution remains largely unchanged when adopting a different limit .",
    "it is appealing to analyze our estimate of the number of active spheroids in the context of their evolutionary history using the simple methodology introduced in this paper .",
    "the relatively constant to small rise in the fraction of active systems is suggestive of the presence of a population of active spheroids , continuous at least up to @xmath97 .",
    "this can also lead to the interpretation that spheroids are being constantly assembled since @xmath97 . at the same time",
    ", the presence of spheroids with homogeneous colors and smooth color gradients is clear evidence of the presence of a relatively dominant population of normal evolved spheroids at all redshifts .",
    "it is possible to ask then , what type of objects are the blue spheroids that we detect ? and , what would be their low redshift counterparts ?",
    "a possible explanation , might be that we are seeing these galaxies as they enter into the e / s0 class , possibly within the first gyr , since their last star - formation activity . from the modeling of stellar synthesis populations",
    "@xcite , it is believed that the existence of such populations is not long - lasting .",
    "we might be seeing the predecessors or proto - ellipticals , in the last period of star - formation before becoming normal ellipticals as we know them at low redshifts and in clusters of galaxies .",
    "in this paper , we have used newly available data from the advanced camera for surveys to study the internal color properties of sample of 116 morphologically selected spheroids .",
    "this represents the first deep dataset of spheroids available from the acs , and we used it to investigate its superb ability to resolve distant galaxies .    using an independent sample of acs spheroids",
    "we have confirmed the presence of a population of spheroids with color inhomogeneities similar to those found in the hdfs . using a model independent approach ,",
    "we have introduced a new statistic , the mean slope which probes successfully the presence of blue cores and internal color inhomogeneities in spheroids .",
    "we compare our measurements with the hdf north with consistent results . assuming that strong variations in the internal color dispersion of spheroids are linked to recent episodes of star formation , we use the mean slope to separate active and passively evolved systems as a function of redshift , and based on this , we estimate the fraction of active systems versus redshift .",
    "we found that within the uncertainties of our measurements , the fraction of active galaxies can be described as constant , with a trend to grow with redshift , with nominal values between @xmath3 of the sample , consistent with previous results .",
    "we take this as evidence for the continuous formation of spheroids since @xmath97 , while the data also shows the presence of a population of old passively evolved ellipticals at all redshifts .",
    "an important part of the challenge that lies ahead is try to understand the significance of the blue spheroids and whether or not these represent the early stages of what we expect to be an elliptical as defined at @xmath71 . additionally , alternative theories of galaxy formation need to be explored which can explain at the same time the presence of passive evolving systems and recent star - forming spheroids .",
    "it also remains to be learned what are the detailed internal properties of ellipticals in clusters are from upcoming acs observations at @xmath97 ( postman et al .",

    "it is known that systematic variations present in the hst psf may influence studies which depend on small aperture photometry or small galaxies with bright cores .",
    "our main concern is the psf variation as a function of wavelength , which might induce spurious centrally concentrated color inhomogeneities on sharply peaked light profiles . to investigate the bias level introduced by variations of the psf in our internal color analysis of spheroids",
    ", we carried out monte carlo simulations following a procedure similar to the one described in @xcite .",
    "this consists of creating artificial galaxies using the iraf package artdata resembling the sizes and brightness as of those in our study .",
    "these were subsequently analyzed in the same fashion as the observed data .",
    "initially we attempted to create artificial de vaucouleurs profiles using a combination of averaged observed bright stars in the background of the tadpole field as psf .",
    "however , it was soon evident that there was a systematic variation in the psf fwhm as a function of position in the wfc field .",
    "in addition , the small number of bright stars in the tadpole field made the use of stars as real psfs too challenging .",
    "the psf variation across the wfc field has been extensively documented by @xcite .",
    "although the psf variations in acs are less than other hst cameras , its does varies over the field , most notably for the wfc ( see fig .  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we chose to utilize the synthetic psfs generated with the tiny tim software as it does take into account field variations .",
    "we created a grid of @xmath98 psfs at evenly distributed positions across both wfc chips with tiny tim for the and bands .",
    "these were incorporated into acs mock raw images and later processed through apsis using the same parameters as for the observed data .",
    "these yield a geometrically corrected grid image of synthetic psfs . in fig .",
    "[ fig : shape ] we show a diagram with the final positions . using this grid , spheroids were synthesized at each psf location with de vaucouleurs profiles using iraf s artdata .",
    "a set of simulated spheroids were generated for the and bands trying to mimic as much as possible the observed properties of spheroids .",
    "these include a range of half - light radius ( @xmath99 ) from @xmath100 which correspond to a physical length of @xmath101  kpc ( @xmath73  km  s@xmath74mpc@xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) and a range of magnitudes consisted with our sample ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "we processed the synthetic spheroids using the exact same procedure employed for real spheroids and calculated both estimators ,  and the mean slope  for the whole sample . to simplify the simulation we compute the mean slope as function of the object apparent size .",
    "as the influence of the psf in the resolved colors is expected to be a strong function of the peakiness of light distribution of the galaxy , we probe the influence of the psf on real and simulated galaxies against the central concentration parameter ( section  [ sec : selection ] ) .",
