    "the height of the step is therefore @xmath92 the exact shape of the transition is a little bit more complicated to calculate , since the problem is nonlinear due to the mutual dependence of the electron spectrum and the absorption coefficient , the geometry of the radiation transport , which has to be considered , and the time dependence before establishing the equilibrium spectrum . for a field of e.g. @xmath93 g",
    "a step in the electron spectrum of one order of magnitude is expected at @xmath94mev / c ( using our simple approach ) , very close to the position of the expected flattening below the injection peak in the _ secondary electron model_. the _ in - situ acceleration model _ predicts no step at this energy , since the cooling function determines only the high energy cutoff region of the spectrum , where the cooling gets comparable to the acceleration .",

    "is expected to arise from the sharp change in opacity for low frequency radio photons due to synchrotron self absorption , which could distinguish between a relativistic electron population which is cooling and one which is gaining energy , as it is predicted for _ primary _ and _ secondary electron models _ on the one hand , and for _ in - situ acceleration models _ on the other hand .",
    "another signature of the _ secondary electron model _ is a flattening of the spectrum below the main electron injection energy .",
    "future observations of diffuse emission might test the electron distribution sensitively enough in order to see these signatures .",
    "present observations restrict the electron population sufficiently , so that a central magnetic field strength higher than @xmath95 is needed in order to explain the observed synchrotron emission , if the steep volume integrated radio spectrum with spectral index of 1.34 can be extrapolated to lower frequencies , or a limit of @xmath96 , if a break appears below the observed range .",
    "since these limits arise from a detected euv flux excess , which is interpreted to result from a cool gas component of the intra cluster medium , the possibility remains , that this flux results in fact from inverse compton scattering of microwave photons , if the field strength is below @xmath97 g .",
    "this possibility seems to be in contradiction with the faraday measurement of feretti et al .",
    "( 1995 ) of @xmath98 g .",
    "but since the inverse compton argumentation gives volume averaged field strength which are weighted with the relativistic electron distribution , stronger field strength in regions with a low density of relativistic electron could solve this contradiction .",
    "if the nature of this euv excess can be understood theoretically , the euv limit on inverse compton flux might be improved and a higher field strength limits might result .",
    "limits without extrapolation of the electron spectrum come from the scattering of starlight photons to egret energies ( @xmath99 ) and microwave photons to osse energies ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "magnetic field limits from inverse compton limits are below the estimates resulting from faraday rotation measurements , being therefore in good agreement .",
    "they measure the magnetic content of the coma cluster on a more global scale , and demonstrate independently that the observed faraday rotation results from magnetic fields within the intra cluster medium .",
    "future euv , x- and gamma - ray telescopes will raise these limits on the magnetic field strength in the coma halo region to the level of faraday measurements , or they will detect energetic nonthermal photons from coma , resulting from inverse compton scattering or from other sources .",
