    "recently we discussed for the first time production of four jets within high - energy ( @xmath1-)factorization ( hef ) approach with 2 @xmath2 4 subproceses with two off - shell partons @xcite .",
    "four - jet production seems a natural case to look for hard double - parton scattering ( dps ) effects ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "some time ago we analyzed how to find optimal conditions for the observation and exploration of dps effects in four - jet production @xcite . in this analysis only the leading - order ( lo ) collinear approach was applied both to single and double - parton scattering mechanisms .",
    "very recently , we have performed for the first time a calculation of four - jet production for both single - parton and double - parton mechanism within @xmath1-factorization @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the effective inclusion of higher - order effects leads to a substantial damping of the double - scattering contribution with respect to the sps one , especially for symmetric ( identical ) cuts on the transverse momenta of all jets .",
    "so far , most practical calculations of dps contributions were performed within the so - called factorized ansatz . in this approach ,",
    "the cross section for dps is a product of the corresponding cross sections for single - parton scatterings ( sps ) .",
    "this is a phenomenologically motivated approximation which is not well under control yet .",
    "a better formalism exists in principle , but predictions are not easy , as they require unknown input(s ) , _",
    "double - parton distributions that should contain informations about space - configuration , spin , colour or flavour correlations between the two partons in one hadron @xcite .",
    "these objects are explored to a far lesser extent than the standard single pdfs .",
    "however , the factorized model seems to be a reasonable tool to collect empirical facts to draw useful conclusions about possible identification of the dps effects in several processes .    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , jets with low cuts on the transverse momenta and a large rapidity separation seem more promissing in exploring dps effects in four - jet production . in the following",
    "we shall show our recent results for sps and dps calculations obtained for first time in @xmath1-factorization approach and concentrate on the study of optimal observables to pin down dps contributions .",
    "the theoretical formalism used to obtain the following predictions was discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "all details related to the scattering amplitudes with off - shell initial state partons as well as with the transverse momentum dependent or unintegrated parton distribution functions ( tmds ) can be found in our original paper .    here",
    "we only very briefly recall the basic high - energy ( or @xmath0)-factorization ( hef ) formula for the calculation of the inclusive partonic four - jet cross section : @xmath3 above @xmath4 is the tmd for a given parton type , @xmath5 are the longitudinal momentum fractions , @xmath6 is a factorization scale , @xmath7 the parton s transverse momenta .",

    "the so - called pocket formula for dps cross sections ( for a four - parton final state ) reads : @xmath11 where the @xmath12 cross sections are obtained by restricting ( [ kt_cross ] ) to a single channel and the symmetry factor @xmath13 is @xmath14 if the two hard scatterings are identical , to avoid double counting .",
    "finally , @xmath15 and @xmath16 stand for generic kinematical variables for the first and second scattering , respectively .",
    "the effective cross section @xmath17 can be interpreted as a measure of correlation in the transverse plane of the two partons inside the hadrons , whereas the possible longitudinal correlations are usually neglected . in the numerical calculations here we use @xmath17 = 15 mb that is a typical value known from the world systematics @xcite .",
