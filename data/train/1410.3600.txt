    "recently a novel scheme for performing quantum information processing was introduced based on spin coherent states @xcite .",

    "@xmath21 is an excited state which optically couples to the @xmath22 state .",
    "such cavities coupled to becs have been realized in atom chip systems where strong coupling has been achieved @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the cavity is to coherently convert an excitation @xmath21 into a cavity photon @xmath23 .",
    "the cavities are coupled to each other via an optic fiber , described by the hamiltonian @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the mode within the fiber , @xmath26 is the coupling between the cavity and the fiber , and @xmath27 is the energy of the modes .",
    "diagonalizing ( [ fiberham ] ) , an eigenstate with energy @xmath27 exists of the form @xmath28 , which we use as the common mode linking the two becs @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the becs may be placed within the same optical cavity , such that they access the same physical mode .",
    "the basic concept of the scheme ( see fig . [ scheme ] ) is to create an effective @xmath0 interaction by taking advantage of the following fourth - order process 1 ) a photon is absorbed by bec 1 from the laser ; 2 ) the photon is re - emitted through the cavity mode ; 3 ) the photon is absorbed by bec 2 ; 4 ) stimulated transition of the atom back to the ground state by the laser .",
    "the hamiltonian coupling the becs to the common mode can be described @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the detuning between the cavity and the @xmath31 transition and @xmath32 is the atom - cavity mode coupling .",

    "the procedure also produces a self - interaction hamiltonian @xmath46 on each of the becs , which corresponds to a squeezing term @xcite .",
    "the squeezing term is an unwanted by - product of the scheme for our purposes , and is present in all schemes as listed in the introduction @xcite .",
    "methods to remove the squeezing term have been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a two - step process is used to first create the desired @xmath45 entanglement , then each bec is squeezed in the reverse direction to cancel off these effects .",
    "to analyze the performance of the scheme , we consider the following master equation taking in to account of cavity loss and spontaneous emission @xmath47 +      \\frac{\\gamma_s}{2 }     \\sum_{i=1,2 } ( \\mathcal{d}[f_{ai}^{-}]\\rho + \\mathcal{d}[f_{bi}^{-}]\\rho ) \\nonumber \\\\      & + \\frac{\\gamma_c}{2 }     \\mathcal{d}[c]\\rho ,       \\label{masteqdec}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48\\rho\\equiv 2 \\hat{o } \\rho \\hat{o}^\\dagger -\\hat{o}^\\dagger \\hat{o } \\rho - \\rho \\hat{o } \\hat{o}^\\dagger$ ] , @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",

    "@xcite , for a @xmath0 interaction the maximal entanglement is generated for states starting in states lying on the equator of the bloch sphere . from the simulations we can see that our protocol in all cases successfully creates entanglement between the two becs , even when taking in to account decoherence effects .",
    "a non - zero value of the logarithmic negativity is sufficient to show that entanglement is present .",
    "a zero value of logarithmic negativity does not however necessarily mean that entanglement is not present @xcite .    to confirm that our simulation correctly reproduces known results , we first consider the @xmath72 case corresponding to a standard qubit .",
    "setting @xmath72 reduces all spin operators to standard pauli operators @xmath73 , thus our scheme should produce a @xmath74 two qubit interaction . to illustrate the performance of the protocol under a variety of conditions , we consider two primary cases of where the intermediate states are off - resonant ( @xmath75 ) and resonant ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "figure [ fig2entvt](a)(b ) shows our results these cases respectively .",
    "we see that without spontaneous emission and cavity decay the entanglement agrees well with the ideal @xmath74 curve , reaching the maximally entangled state halfway through the entangling operation .",
    "both the off - resonant and resonant cases produces nearly identical results in terms of the entanglement generated .",
    "we note that the entanglement curves can be made to approach to ideal cases simply by increasing the detuning @xmath77 to larger values .",
    "the discrepancy in the zero decoherence cases to the ideal curves may be attributed to an effective decoherence from tracing out the excited and photonic degrees of freedom , which become populated as a result of the protocol . for cases including spontaneous decay and cavity photon loss ,",
    "the entanglement generated is reduced as expected . our chosen parameters for the spontaneous emission follow the typical experimental parameters ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : exp ] ) as set by the cavity as realized in ref .",
    "these effects may also be reduced by increasing the detuning , at the expense of producing a slower entangling times according to ( [ hbaromega ] ) .",
    "we now turn to the @xmath78 case , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2entvt](c)(d ) .",
    "due to the exponential growth of the hilbert space with @xmath10 , we are restricted in our numerical simulations to relatively small boson numbers @xmath79 . nevertheless , our numerical results confirm the expected behavior of the protocol .",

    "the number of these dips increase with @xmath10 , although many of these are seen already in the @xmath81 simulations shown .",
    "the amount of entanglement created by the @xmath0 interaction does not reach the maximal entanglement @xmath82 , as a @xmath0 interaction never creates the state ( [ maxentstate ] ) but asymptotically approaches @xmath83 for large @xmath84 @xcite . for our chosen parameters",
    ", the protocol generally gives a similar form to the ideal @xmath0 curve , but with a reduced amount of entanglement .",
    "most of the discrepancy occurs away from the dips in the entanglement , with some of the values in the entanglement agreeing very well in the dipped points .",
    "we speculate that this may occur due to the effective decoherence being of a @xmath1-dephasing form , which produces a similar type reduction in entanglement as seen in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "when spontaneous decay and cavity loss are included the entanglement drops significantly , more than that seen in the @xmath72 case .",
    "we attribute this to the sensitiveness of the created states to the effective decoherence created by spontaneous decay and cavity loss . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that a @xmath85-dephasing strongly suppresses the formation of states beyond times @xmath86 as schrodinger cat - like states are created for these times .",
    "however , for relatively short timescales such as @xmath87 it is possible for stable entanglement to be generated .",
    "we thus expect that in a realistic situation only these short timescale gates are producible reliably . in terms of the production of macroscopic entanglement , at times",
    "@xmath88 it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath89 can be created formed .",
    "we analyze the stability of these states in the next subsection .      for macroscopic objects",
    "it is generally expected that quantum effects , including entanglement , are difficult to observe due to the fast decoherence which sets in for large particle number @xmath10 .",
    "however , it is known that under certain circumstances quantum effects may survive in macroscopic objects . for example , experiments such as that performed in refs .",
    "@xcite entanglement between macroscopic ensembles of atoms are created and used to realize teleportation .",
    "this apparent disparity is resolved by noting that decoherence inherently depends on the type of state that one starts with .",
    "for example , a schrodinger cat state , which in our system would take the form @xmath90 decoheres at a timescale proportional to @xmath91 , while a spin coherent state @xmath92 decoheres at a timescale @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "this state - dependency of the decoherence means that for various types of entangled state , it is important to compare states of the same type , in order to understand whether a given state will survive in the macroscopic limit .    for the @xmath0 interaction that our protocol aims to produce ,",
    "there are several characteristic types of state that are of particular interest .",
    "the first type of state corresponds to evolution times @xmath94 . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , these entangling times are required for the spin coherent state analogue of the cnot gate , and the amount of entanglement generated is comparable to a single qubit with @xmath95 . in terms of the `` devil s crevasse '' entanglement curve in fig .",
    "[ fig2entvt](c)(d ) , this corresponds to very early times in the evolution , at the base of the initial turn - on of the entanglement .",
    "gate times of the order @xmath13 only cause a small redistribution of the spin coherent states around the bloch sphere , thus are still within the continuous variable approximation . in the presence of dephasing , such states are rather robust and",
    "are expected to survive in the macroscopic limit @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "the second characteristic state occurs for evolution times @xmath97 . at these timescales ,",
    "the spin coherent states are distributed evenly around the equator of the bloch sphere , each entangled with a @xmath1 eigenstate on the other bec .",
    "the amount of entanglement generated at these times is of the order of the maximal entanglement between the becs , in the sense that @xmath98 . in the presence of decoherence",
    ", these states decay with a power law with @xmath10 , thus under suitable conditions can be observable for large scale systems @xcite . for timescales @xmath99 , very fragile schrodinger cat - like states",
    "are generated , which exponentially decay in the presence of decoherence @xcite . for a more detailed description of the types of states that are created , we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite , in which we investigate the effects of dephasing on the entanglement generated by a pure @xmath0 interaction .",
    "we summarize the general behavior according to @xmath100 where @xmath101 is a parameter such that @xmath102 .",
    "therefore under realistic conditions we expect that only states @xmath103 are observable for large systems . even for the relatively small systems simulated in this paper , the results of fig .",
    "[ fig2entvt](c)(d ) confirm this expectation , where the entanglement quickly decays to zero for these timescales .",
    "for these reasons henceforth we examine the two timescales @xmath104 .",
    "figure [ fig4scalingsqrt2n ] shows the entanglement scaling for the difference @xmath105 for the time @xmath106 .",
    "we plot the difference @xmath105 between the normalized entanglement @xmath107 generated by an ideal @xmath0 interaction and the proposed scheme as a measure of how well the entanglement survives in the macroscopic limit @xmath108 .",
    "looking at the case of constant detuning @xmath109 ( fig .",
    "[ fig4scalingsqrt2n](a ) ) , we see poor scaling behavior in both the decoherence free case and including spontaneous emission and cavity decay , which may suggest that the protocol fails for large systems .",
    "the reason for this failure can be attributed to the effective decoherence due to spontaneous decay being enhanced due to the atom number @xmath10 . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the spontaneous decay creates a decoherence at the effective rate @xmath110 we may thus compensate for the enhanced spontaneous emission by choosing increasingly large detunings as @xmath10 is increased .",
    "this suggests that a suitable strategy may be to choose the detuning @xmath111 such as to cancel the @xmath10 dependence in ( [ effdec ] ) .",
    "for comparison we also try the more aggressive detuning strategy @xmath112 .    using the scaling detunings",
    ", we now see that @xmath105 behaves more favorably in both the cases with and without decoherence as @xmath10 is increased ( fig .",
    "[ fig4scalingsqrt2n ] ) .",
    "these results would suggest that in order to generate states of the type @xmath106 it is important to choose a detuning that is sufficiently large to overcome the spontaneous decay effects , which have a stronger effect to destroy this class of state .",
    "we note that for the dephasing case previously studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was found that the entanglement should scale as a power law for @xmath106 , thus although no entanglement survives in the limit of @xmath96 , for large but finite systems some entanglement can survive .",
    "figure [ fig3scalingpi4n ] shows the scaling of the entanglement with boson number @xmath10 at the time @xmath113 .",
    "we see that states created around this characteristic time show good scaling with increasing @xmath114 , becoming increasingly closer to the pure interaction .",
    "the cases including spontaneous decay and cavity photon loss show a strong improvement as the system size is increased .",
    "this can be attributed to the shorter physical gate times @xmath113 as the @xmath10 is increased .",
    "the shorter times that the system are evolved mean that there is less time for spontaneous decay and cavity photon loss to occur , which improve the performance of the scheme .",
    "the same general behavior was seen in the scaling in ref .",
    "@xcite for an @xmath0 interaction in the presence of dephasing .",
    "these calculations suggest that states with @xmath113 should be able to be robustly created for macroscopic systems .      to visualize the states that are generated by the current protocol , it is instructive to plot the q - distribution to show the distribution of the states on the bloch sphere @xcite . for an ideal @xmath0 interaction , the state that is generated",
    "is written @xcite @xmath115 as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , we may understand this state as an entangled state between number states on bec 2 and spin coherent states distributed at various locations on the equator of the bloch sphere on bec 1 .",
    "we note that there is no asymmetry between becs 1 and 2 as the above expression may be rewritten by expanding bec 1 in the number basis and leaving bec 2 in the spin coherent state basis .",
    "we may create visualizations of the state by projecting the entangled state on number states of bec 2 , then calculating the partial q - distributions for bec 1 defined as @xmath116 due to the projection on the @xmath117 basis , the integral of the distributions ( [ qfuncdef ] ) are no longer normalized to unity .",
    "the integrated distribution gives the probability of the particular @xmath118-coherent state pairing , which depends on the amplitude of the term in ( [ entangledstate ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig5qfuncs ] shows the partial q - distributions for a state generated using the off - resonant scheme for the state @xmath88 .",
    "as expected , we see that for various @xmath119 projections , the states on bec 1 are distributed at various positions on the equator of the bloch sphere , in accordance with ( [ entangledstate ] ) .",
    "one difference to ( [ entangledstate ] ) is that instead of spin coherent states on bec 1 , which would appear as symmetric gaussian distributions for the q - distribution , we have diagonally squeezed states .",
    "this may be attributed to the self - interaction term @xmath120 that are present in ( [ effham ] ) which produce a squeezing of the distribution @xcite .",
    "if one wishes to generate a pure @xmath0 interaction , it is necessary to cancel the squeezing terms in the hamiltonian , which may be achieved by methods such as that discussed in refs .",

    "the plots show the gaussian distributions distributed at various equatorial positions displaying the expected @xmath0 correlations .",
    "each of the distributions show unexpectedly far less squeezing in comparison to fig .",
    "[ fig5qfuncs ] .",

    "while it is clear from ( [ fullacstark ] ) that no squeezing should result from ( [ laserham ] ) , the truncation introduced in the simulation artificially introduces this . assuming a maximum of one excited state in @xmath21 , the hamiltonian ( [ laserham ] ) becomes @xmath125 the ground state correction is then @xmath126 which on expanding the square root apparently produces an effective hamiltonian @xmath127 while the ac stark shift is correctly predicted in the first term of ( [ spuriousham ] ) , a spurious spin squeezing term is created due to the truncation . for the parameters chosen in fig .",
