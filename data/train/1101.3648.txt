    "the equation of state ( eos ) of cold nuclear matter can be written as the sum of the energy per nucleon of symmetric matter and a symmetry energy term , @xmath0 @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the asymmetry ; @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the neutron , proton and nucleon densities , respectively .",
    "the first term on the rhs , @xmath6 , is the eos term for symmetric nuclear matter with equal fractions of neutrons and protons .",
    "significant constraints on the symmetric matter eos at 1 @xmath7 4.5 have been obtained from measurements of collective flow @xcite and kaon production @xcite . however , well - determined constraints on the symmetry term , @xmath8 , are few .",
    "@xmath9 describes the density dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "since large variations in nuclear density can be attained momentarily in nuclear collisions , constraints on the equation of state ( eos ) can be obtained by comparing measurements to transport calculations of such collisions .",
    "the symmetry energy has been recently probed at sub - saturation densities via isospin diffusion @xcite , and by double ratios involving neutron and proton energy spectra @xcite .",
    "these two observables largely reflect the transport of nucleons under the combined influence of the mean fields and the collisions induced by residual interactions ; thus , they should be within the predictive capabilities of transport theory .",
    "this article focuses on investigations of the symmetry energy at sub - saturation density .",
    "the constraints obtained in heavy ion collisions are compared to constraints obtained from nuclear structure studies , from isobaric analog states , sn isotope skins , pygmy dipole resonance experiments , and the giant dipole resonance data .",
    "i will briefly discuss investigations of the density dependence of symmetry energy at supranormal density .",
    "transport models have been used to describe the dynamics of heavy ion collisions .",
    "we chose to use the imqmd code mainly because of its ability to describe fragments which are quite important in describing isospin observables . in the qmd model ,",
    "nucleons are represented by gaussian wavepackets .",
    "the mean fields acting on these wavepackets are derived from an energy functional with the potential energy u that includes the full skyrme potential energy with only the spin - orbit term omitted : @xmath10 where , @xmath11 is the coulomb energy and @xmath12 represents the nuclear contributions in local form and @xmath13 where the asymmetry @xmath14 , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the neutron and proton densities , respectively .",
    "a symmetry kinetic energy density of the form @xmath17 and symmetry potential energy density of the form @xmath18 were used in the following transport model comparisons . the energy density associated with the mean - field momentum dependence",
    "is represented by @xmath19 ^ 2 \\label{eq : umd}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 are nucleon wigner functions , @xmath21 , the energy is in mev and momenta are in mev / c .",
    "the resulting interaction between wavepackets is described in ref .",
    "unless otherwise noted , we use @xmath22=-356 mev , @xmath23=303 mev and @xmath24 = 7/6 , corresponding to a isoscalar compressibility constant of k=200 mev , and @xmath25=19.47 mev@xmath26 , @xmath27=-11.35 mev@xmath26 , @xmath28=24.9 mev , @xmath29=35.19 mev , and @xmath30 = 0 mev .",
    "these calculations use isospin - dependent in - medium nucleon - nucleon scattering cross sections in the collision term and pauli blocking effects that are described in @xcite .",
    "cluster yields are calculated by means of the coalescence model widely used in qmd calculations in which particles with relative momenta smaller than @xmath31 and relative distances smaller than @xmath32 are coalesced into one cluster . in the present work , values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 are employed .",
    "we turn our attention first to the interpretation of neutron / proton double ratio data , which derives its sensitivity to the symmetry energy from the opposite sign of the symmetry force for neutrons as compared to protons @xcite .",
    "first experimental comparisons of neutron and proton spectra in ref.@xcite used a double ratio in order to reduce sensitivity to uncertainties in the neutron detection efficiencies and to relative uncertainties in energy calibrations of neutrons and protons .",
    "this double ratio , @xmath35 was constructed by measuring the energy spectra , @xmath36 , of neutrons and protons for two systems a and b characterized by different isospin asymmetries .",
    "the star symbols in the left panel of figure 1 show the double ratios measured at @xmath37 as a function of nucleon center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "energy for central collisions of @xmath38 and @xmath39 at e / a=50 mev .",
    "we have performed calculations at an impact parameter of b=1 , 2 and 3 fm at an incident energy of 50 mev per nucleon for two systems : a=@xmath38 and b=@xmath39 .",
    "about 60,000 events are simulated for each impact parameter . within the statistical uncertainties ,",
    "the double ratio observable , dr(n / p ) , is nearly independent of the impact parameters within the range of 0@xmath40b@xmath405 fm .",
    "the lines in the left panel of figure 1 show the predicted double ratios dr(np)=@xmath41 as a function of the c.m .",
    "energy of nucleons emitted at @xmath42 for @xmath43=0.35 , 0.5 , 0.75 , 1 and 2 .",
    "the uncertainties for these calculations in figure 1 are statistical . as fewer nucleons",
    "are emitted at high energy , the uncertainties increase with increasing energy . despite the large experimental uncertainties , especially for the higher energy ( @xmath4440 mev ) data , the trends and magnitudes of the data points definitely rule out the very soft ( @xmath43=0.35 , dotted line with open diamond points ) and very stiff ( @xmath43=2 , dotted line with closed diamond symbols ) density - dependent symmetry terms . we find the @xmath45 uncertainty range of values for @xmath43 to be 0.4@xmath46 1.04 , corresponding to an increase in @xmath47 by 4 above its minimum of @xmath48 2.1 near @xmath49 .",
    "the density dependence of the symmetry energy can also be probed in peripheral collisions between two nuclei with different isospin asymmetries by examining the diffusion of neutrons and protons across the neck that joins the nuclei .",
    "this `` isospin diffusion '' generally continues until the two nuclei separate or until the chemical potentials for neutrons and protons in both nuclei become equal . to isolate diffusion effects from other effects such as pre - equilibrium emission , coulomb effects , and secondary decays , measurements of isospin diffusion compare `` mixed '' collisions involving a neutron - rich nucleus a and a neutron - deficient nucleus b to the `` symmetric '' collisions involving a+a and b+b .",
    "the degree of isospin equilibration in such collisions can be quantified by rescaling the isospin observable x according to the isospin transport ratio @xmath50 @xcite given by @xmath51 in the absence of isospin diffusion , @xmath52=1 for a collision involving a neutron - rich projectile on a proton - rich target .",
    "likewise , without diffusion , @xmath53=-1 . on the other hand ,",
    "if isospin equilibrium is achieved for roughly equal sized projectiles and target nuclei , @xmath54 .",
    "using imqmd model , we investigate @xmath55 as a function of the rapidity of the emitted particles .",
    "the results of the calculations are shown by the lines in the right panel of figure 2 .",
    "the data , represented by the star symbols , are obtained from the yield ratios of the mirror nuclei pair , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , @xmath58@xcite .",
    "this calculation reproduces the shapes and magnitudes of the rapidity dependence of the isospin transport ratios @xmath59 .",
    "the @xmath47 analysis brackets @xmath43 values to lie in the region 0.4@xmath601.0 using the same @xmath45 criterion .",
    "there is substantial overlap between the constraints obtained from isospin diffusion and double neutron and proton yield ratios .",
    "constraints on the exponent @xmath43 depend on the symmetry energy at saturation density , @xmath61 .",
    "increasing @xmath62 has the same effect on the isospin transport ratio as decreasing @xmath43 .",
    "thus @xmath62 and @xmath43 can not be determined independently . to provide constraints on @xmath62 and @xmath43 parameters , contours with constant @xmath47 values can be created by doing two - dimensional @xmath47 analysis in the @xmath63 parameter space .",
    "unfortunately , the cpu requirements for such large - scale imqmd calculations are too intensive to make such analysis practical . instead",
    ", we have preformed a series of imqmd calculations at b=6 fm with different values of @xmath43 over selected values of @xmath62 between 25 to 40 mev to locate the approximate boundaries in the @xmath62 and @xmath43 plane that satisfy the 2@xmath64 criterion in the @xmath47 analysis of the isospin diffusion data .",
    "the shaded area shown in the inset of figure 3 is the result of such analysis .",
    "near saturation density , one may expand the symmetry energy , @xmath9 , about the saturation density , @xmath65 , @xmath66 where l and @xmath67 are slope and curvature parameters at @xmath65 .",
    "the slope parameter , l , is related to @xmath68 , the pressure from the symmetry energy for pure neutron matter at saturation density : @xmath69\\cdot p_0\\ ] ] @xmath68 , provides the baryonic contribution to the pressure in neutron stars @xcite , where the energy of symmetric matter , @xmath6 , does not contribute to the pressure .",
    "it is also related to the neutron skin thickness ( @xmath70 ) of neutron - rich heavy nuclei including @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "the series of imqmd results calculated at b=6 fm with different values of @xmath43 over selected values of @xmath62 between 25 to 40 mev give the approximate boundaries in the @xmath62 and @xmath72 plane that satisfy the 2@xmath64 criterion in the @xmath47 analysis of the isospin diffusion data .",
    "the area bounded by the two solid diagonal lines in figure 2 and the shaded region in figure 3 represents a conservative estimate in such effort .",
    "another independent constraint will be needed to provide constraints in @xmath62 or @xmath72 .",
    "recent analysis of the skin thickness of tin isotopes @xcite suggests that l decreases with increasing @xmath62 .",
    "the two diagonal dashed lines plotted in figure 2 represent a 2@xmath64 analysis of the @xmath47 discussed in ref . @xcite .",
    "since the trend is opposite to that of the constraints provided by the heavy ion reactions ( solid lines ) , the overlap of the two constraints provide a range of @xmath62 and @xmath72 values .",
    "as pointed out by chen et al , the interesting thing to note is that the mean @xmath72 values , represented by the horizontal line in figure 2 obtained from the overlap region of the two constraints , are nearly constant .",
    "the range of @xmath72 and @xmath62 values in the overlap region corresponds to a mean skin thickness of @xmath71 of about 0.18@xmath730.04 fm @xcite .",
    "the range of experimental neutron skin thicknesses of @xmath71 varies from about 0.13 to 0.22 fm @xcite which are consistent with results predicted by the constraints .",
    "we have included , in figure 3 , other constraints from the properties of individual nuclei .",
    "the corresponding values of pure neutron matter pressure , @xmath68 , are given in the right axis .",
    "the lower box centered at @xmath62 = 32.5 mev depicts the range of @xmath62 and @xmath65 values from analysis of low - lying electric dipole strength ( pygmy dipole resonance , pdr ) in neutron - rich nuclei @xmath74 and @xmath75 @xcite . the upper box centered at @xmath62",
    "= 32.5 mev depicts the constraints reported in ref .",
    "@xcite from the analysis of the excitation energies of isobaric analog states ( ias ) .",
    "all these constraints overlap significantly with the hatched regions obtained from the heavy ion collisions of tin isotopes as described in section 3 .",
    "the inset shows what this analysis implies about the density dependence of the symmetry energy . a value for the symmetry energy at around 0.6 normal nuclear matter density , extracted from giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) data @xcite , is indicated by the symbol in the inset .",
    "in summary , the ability of qmd models to reproduce both isospin diffusion data and double ratio of neutron and proton spectra data is an important step forward in obtaining information about the symmetry energy in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the heavy ion as well as nuclear structure observables examined here provide consistent constraints on the density dependence of the symmetry energy .    to explore",
    "the density dependence of the symmetry energy , an international collaboration , consisting of an interdisciplinary , experimental and theoretical team of scientists , has been formed @xcite to conduct a series of experiments at unique facilities based in the united states ( the national superconducting cyclotron laboratory at michigan state university ) , japan ( the radioactive ion beam factory at riken ) and gsi , germany .",
    "each facility enables the exploration of a different density range . with experiments",
    "underway at gsi , better constraints at supra normal density is expected in the near future .",
