    "2 ) , although the fact that it is unresolved in the vla data ( fig .",

    "this discrepancy is most likely due to low level residual sidelobes that are apparent in the merlin image ( caused by insufficient uv coverage ) at the position of feature  5 .",
    "since all of the other vla line flux density is recovered in the merlin image , we conclude that the masers do not exhibit structure on scales larger than @xmath36  mas .",

    "the 1a core sizes are in the range @xmath38  mas , with brightness temperatures @xmath1  k , and are summarized in table  2 . the vlba image ( fig .",
    "3 ) contains about 75% of the line flux density in the merlin image of feature  1a .",
    "thus we would argue that about 75% of the maser emission comes from compact cores while about 25% of the maser emission exists on extended angular scales resolved out by the vlba .",
    "figure  3 also shows the vlba stokes  @xmath35 spectra at the three image peaks whose properties are summarized in table  3 .",
    "the merlin and vlba stokes @xmath35 spectra at the peak maser positions were fitted with gaussian profiles using the gipsygipsy/. ] software package .",
    "the resulting deconvolved line widths of the maser line profiles from the merlin and the vlba observations are summarized in table  3 .",
    "these data are comparable to other oh ( 1720  mhz ) maser observations , with typical line widths of @xmath39 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "however , a few of the ic  443 snr maser lines are measured to have velocity widths less than the doppler velocity width @xmath40 of the masing gas .",
    "we estimate the minimum doppler velocity width in the maser by assuming a gas temperature of @xmath41  k in accord with the molecular studies of the shocked region ( _ e.g_.  van  dishoeck , jansen , & phillips 1993 ) and by ignoring the doppler contributions of any bulk turbulent flows in the shock . by this method",
    "we find @xmath42  km  s@xmath4  in ic  443 clump g1 .",
    "any contributions from turbulent motions , which are expected to be small , would broaden the expected @xmath43 and further stress that the maser lines are sub - doppler .",
    "thus , the merlin 1a line ( @xmath44  km  s@xmath4 ) and the vlba 1a1 line ( @xmath45  km  s@xmath4 ) are appreciably narrower than the expected doppler profile .",
    "the significance of these sub - doppler line widths is discussed in  4.2 .",
    "figure  4 shows the stokes @xmath35 and @xmath2 profiles from the 1a source peak of the merlin image in figure  2 .",
    "this figure demonstrates that the 1a maser is @xmath46% right circularly polarized .",
    "the stokes @xmath2 profiles for merlin features 1b , 2 , and 3 and vlba feature  1a1 also show @xmath46% circular polarization .",
    "features 1b and 2 are right circularly polarized , while feature  3 is left circularly polarized .",
    "the stokes @xmath2 profiles from the c97 vla data are in agreement with these merlin and vlba results , in both the magnitude and sense of circular polarization .",
    "these ic  443 circular polarization results are in distinct contrast to the zeeman s - shaped profiles typically observed in oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr masers ( _ e.g_.  brogan et al .",
    "2000 ; c99 ; c97 ) .",
    "the geometry at the shock front is an important consideration when discussing the measured maser sizes .",
    "oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr masers are observed only at the snr / molecular cloud interface where the shock front is moving transversely across the plane of the sky ( _ e.g_.  frail et al .",
    "ic  443 provides an excellent example of this geometrical selection effect .",
    "there is a @xmath20  pc ring of shocked molecular interaction around the snr ( _ e.g_.  dickman et al .",
    "1992 ) but the masers are only observed in clump g where the shock is moving transverse to the line of sight ( _ e.g_.  wang & scoville 1992 ) .",
    "this transverse motion allows maximum velocity coherence along the line of sight .",
    "the post - shock region that provides the collisional pump conditions ( lge ; wardle 1999 ) is determined by the downstream temperature profile needed for the collisional excitation and the dissociative snr x - rays that generate oh molecules from h@xmath47o that is formed upstream .",
    "lge suggest that the size of the region suitable for population inversion and maser emission @xmath48 is @xmath49  cm ( @xmath50  au ) .",
    "this transverse scale @xmath48 is much smaller than the measured size of the shocked clump g region : @xmath51  cm ( turner et al.1992 ; van  dishoeck et al .",
    "1993 ; tauber et al .  1994 ; cesarsky et al .",
    "1999 ) . however , these sizes are only an upper limit to the possible transverse sizes @xmath52 of the masers .",
    "the physical conditions required for the maser emission are more stringent than those responsible for the shocked emission observed in the molecular studies .",
    "we measure angular sizes in the range @xmath34  mas , corresponding to linear sizes @xmath53  au .",
    "therefore , less than 10% of the transverse width @xmath48 of the ic  443 clump g region that can theoretically produce stimulated emission shows maser radiation .",
    "the multiple compact cores observed in ic  443 with the vlba ( fig .  3 ) are not unique in the oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr maser class .",
    "a similar core / diffuse morphology is observed using merlin and the vlba by c99 in the w44 and w28 masers .",
    "they also note that merlin recovers all of the line flux density observed with the vla .",
    "the vlba observation of the w44 e11 maser source shows a compact core responsible for about half of the emission .",
    "all of the flux density of the w28 e24 , e30 , and e31 maser sources is resolved out completely in the vlba data .",
    "in fact , all of the w28 and w44 masers imaged with the vlba by c99 show some @xmath54  mas structure to which merlin is sensitive , but which is resolved out by the vlba observations .",
    "since the intrinsic structures in the ic  443 , w28 , and w44 masers are comparable , this morphology likely indicates further physical similarity among all oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr maser regions .",
    "we assume that the line of sight to ic  443 is relatively free of scatter - broadening effects ( _ e.g_.   lazio & cordes 1998a , b ) .",
    "we have also measured linear sizes comparable to those observed on merlin and vlba scales by c99 in w28 and w44 .",
    "these angular size and morphology measurements indicate that all merlin and vlba oh ( 1720  mhz ) angular size measurements to date ( _ e.g_.  c99 ; brogan et al .",
    "2002 ) , except those in the galactic center ( yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "1996 ) , have determined the intrinsic maser sizes . in general",
    "it appears that a @xmath55300  au region of diffuse maser emission surrounds multiple compact cores @xmath5560  au in transverse size .      using the narrow line widths of the merlin 1a line and the vlba 1a1 line ( table  3 ) , it is possible to place constraints on the geometry of the maser regions .",
    "elitzur ( 1998 ) suggests that the doppler width @xmath43 expected from the line - emitting gas will be related to the emitted maser line width @xmath56 by @xmath57 such that integer values of @xmath58 correspond to the dimension of filamentary , planar , or ellipsoidal region geometries , respectively .",
    "comparison of this relation with the velocity widths for features  1a ( merlin ) and 1a1 ( vlba ) in table  3 , implies that at least some of the masers are emitted from regions with @xmath59 .",
    "the gas region geometry implied for these features by this line narrowing is roughly ellipsoidal ; the data are not consistent with a thin emitting filament along the line of sight .",
    "lge find that an oh ( 1720  mhz ) maser region with an aspect ratio of three can yield a maser brightness temperature @xmath60  k. this prediction is in good agreement with the brightness temperatures listed in tables  1 and 2 .    we will not discuss various maser line ` rebroadening ' theories ( _ e.g_.  litvak 1970 ; peters & allen 1972 ) that depend explicitly on saturation because we have been unable to constrain the saturation state of the masers .",
    "elitzur ( 1998 ) suggests a test for maser saturation that requires an antisymmetric stokes @xmath2 line profile but , as discussed in  4.3 , we do not observe an antisymmetric stokes @xmath2 line profile in the ic  443 masers . since we may only assume that the masers are saturated on the grounds that they",
    "have not been observed to vary ( see   3.1 , 4.4 ) , the only warranted line width discussion is the geometry theory discussed above .",
    "the zeeman splitting of the oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr maser line emission from supernova remnants has proven to be an outstanding tool for measuring the magnetic field strengths in supernova shock fronts ( _ e.g_.  brogan et al .",
    "the maser stokes  @xmath2 line profiles often show the expected antisymmetrical s - shaped thermal zeeman pattern . in some cases , spatial or spectral blending of different maser components",
    "partially confuse the expected zeeman profile",
    ". however , ic  443 represents the first observation of single - handed circularly polarized line spectra from oh ( 1720  mhz ) masers in supernova remnants ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "there are a number of effects which could potentially cause the observed circular polarization , and many of these could act simultaneously : ( 1 ) spatial blending of masing spots ; ( 2 ) spectral blending of individual maser lines ; ( 3 ) velocity gradients ; ( 4 ) magnetic field gradients ; and ( 5 ) faraday rotation . in the following , we are able to rule out ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) from our observational results .",
    "we can not constrain the contributions of ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 5 ) but we give a few examples of how these effects could conspire to yield the observed polarization .    in general ,",
    "if spatially distinct maser features emit at different velocities or different luminosities , their emission would not present a symmetrical s - shaped zeeman or gaussian stokes @xmath35 profile when convolved together in a large beam .",
    "for example , different oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr maser source spectra are spatially blended in vla observations of w28 and w44 ( c97 ) and do not present simple zeeman stokes @xmath2 profiles .",
    "however , subsequent merlin and vlba observations toward w28 and w44 do discern simple zeeman spectra from multiple spatial components ( c99 ) .",
    "similarly , spatial blending is a complicating factor for the interpretation of ic  443 feature  1 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "vla observations ( c97 ) show a single maser feature while merlin observations ( fig .",
    "2 ) reveal the presence two resolved maser peaks , 1a and 1b .",
    "the merlin 1a maser feature , in turn , has emission from at least three distinct sources ( 1a1 , 1a2 , and 1a3 ; fig .",
    "3 ) on vlba size scales .",
    "surprisingly , the vla , merlin , and vlba data , covering three orders of magnitude in angular resolution , all show the same @xmath5510% circular polarization .",
    "thus , although these ic  443 vlba observations have the highest linear resolution of any oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr maser study to date , no symmetrical s - shaped zeeman line profiles are observed to be spatially blended .",
    "therefore , unlike the w28 and w44 masers for which subsequent merlin and vlba observations do discern simple zeeman spectra ( c99 ) , we observe no evidence that spatial blending is responsible for confusing the circular polarization signal in the ic  443 oh ( 1720  mhz ) masers .",
    "spectral blending may explain the circular polarization levels even when spatial blending can not .",
    "spectral blending , however , is not discernible with multiple angular resolution studies since all of the emission components lie along the line of sight .",
    "it is possible that several different masers , each with the expected zeeman profile , lie along the line of sight with different velocities , line widths , and amplitudes . in specific combinations",
    "these masers could be superposed to yield a 10% circularly polarized line profile .",
    "however , it is unlikely that all of the spatially distinct lines - of - sight in the ic  443 maser images ( figs .  1 , 2 , & 3 ) contain these exact superpositions necessary to reproduce the @xmath46% circular polarization levels .",
    "additionally , the sub - doppler line widths observed in the ic  443 masers (  3.2 , 4.2 ) limit an explanation involving spectral blending , since several line components at different velocities would be required , and such blending must necessarily broaden the observed stokes @xmath35 profile that is their sum . for these reasons",
    ", we do not believe that spectral blending can account for the symmetrical stokes @xmath2 profiles observed for the oh ( 1720 mhz ) masers in ic  443 .    since it appears that neither spectral blending nor spatial blending significantly affects the line profiles observed in the ic  443 oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr masers , the observed @xmath5510% circular polarization levels are most likely an intrinsic property of the maser emission .",
    "elitzur ( 1992 ) reviews a number of polarization selection mechanisms that could affect the oh ( 1720  mhz ) maser collisional pump , including velocity or magnetic field gradients .",
    "for example , cook ( 1966 ) and shklovskii ( 1969 ) require both a magnetic field and velocity gradient along the line of sight in order to amplify one hand of circular polarization .",
    "similarly , deguchi & watson ( 1986 ) predict a circularly polarized line in the presence of a uniform magnetic field and a large velocity gradient . a line - of - sight magnetic field `` beaming",
    "'' geometry has also been suggested to affect the degree of circular polarization ( gray & field 1994 ) .",
    "alternatively , deguchi & watson ( 1993 ) suggest that if the faraday rotation within the gain medium is significant , stokes @xmath61 polarization can be transfered to stokes @xmath2 signal .",
    "for this stokes transfer mechanism , field & gray ( 1994 ) estimate that an electron column density of @xmath62 is required .",

    "1992 ) , and keohane et al .",
    "( 1997 ) indicate electron column densities of this order .",
    "however , it is not clear how the oh ( 1720  mhz ) maser polarization data for ic  443  ( 1 ) the 10% circular polarization ( fig .  4 ) and ( 2 ) the 4.2% linear polarization ( vla : c97 )  can apply or constrain these theories .",

    "1993 ; draine , roberge , & dalgarno 1983 ) .",
    "thus , the phase - referenced vlba maser observations of ic  443 ( fig .  3 ) are suitable as the first epoch of a possible @xmath64  mas proper motion measurement over @xmath24  yr .",
    "alternatively , clump g may remain stationary .",
    "in such a case , the maser lifetime can be expected to be determined by the relatively short shock crossing time @xmath65  yr . indeed , cesarsky et al .",
    "( 1999 ) finds that clump g is not in steady state and rho et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggest the presence of a time - variable @xmath11-type shock to explain their [ oi ] 63.18  @xmath66 m line and infrared continuum data .",
    "however , our data do not show any time variability in the maser emission over the six years between the vla and merlin observations ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "furthermore , mckee & tan ( 2002 ) suggest that stars may form in @xmath67  yr in physical conditions satisfied by oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr maser regions such as ic  443 clump  g and w44 ( cf .",
    "plume et al .",
    "1997 ; wootten 1978 ) .",
    "indeed , star formation theory often identifies shock fronts as the agent by which molecular clouds are compressed to high density ( @xmath68 ) and triggered into the gravitational collapse of new stars ( _ e.g_.  elmegreen & lada 1977 ) .",
    "however , dickman et al .  ( 1992 ) expect the clumps to retain their `` kinematic signatures '' for at least @xmath69  yr .",
    "the timescales of the various dynamical predictions applicable to ic  443 clump g span three or four orders of magnitude .",
    "a proper motion study of the masers in these environments may distinguish between the different theoretical scenarios .",
    "also , future study of the ic  443 system could considerably illuminate the degree to which oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr masers mark the sites of future star formation in molecular clouds ( _ e.g_.  wardle & yusef - zadeh 2002 ) .",
    "interstellar image scatter - broadening is expected to be minimal toward ic  443 near the galactic anticenter .",
    "the merlin and vlba linear resolution at the relatively close 1.5  kpc distance to the supernova remnant is the most favorable of any investigation to date .",
    "thus , these data represent the most reliable measurement of the intrinsic sizes of oh ( 1720  mhz ) masers in supernova remnants . also , we observe multiple compact maser cores at vlba angular scales , as has been observed in other vlbi studies of oh ( 1720  mhz ) masers ( _ e.g_.  c99 ) .",
    "if we generalize these findings to all similar masers , these results indicate that oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr masers have a core / diffuse morphology with linear sizes approaching @xmath70  au and cores smaller than @xmath5560  au .",
    "these measured sizes also indicate that approximately 10% of the shocked `` clump g '' region in ic  443 capable of supporting the maser actually shows maser emission .",
    "the circular polarization profiles of the ic  443 oh masers are unique in their class .",
    "we also present the narrowest line observed from oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr masers .",
    "future work on ic  443 masers should include high spectral and spatial resolution linear polarization imaging . linear polarization information may help constrain the role of the magnetic field in both the zeeman behavior and the geometry of the masing gas ( _ e.g_.  elitzur 1998 ) . a second epoch of phase - referenced proper motion observations of the ic  443 masers may yield information on the dynamical lifetime of the maser regions . in conclusion , though ic  443 contains a relatively small number of oh ( 1720  mhz ) masers compared to other snrs , ic  443 is an excellent laboratory for the study of the polarization and morphology properties that seem to be ubiquitous in the oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr maser class .",
