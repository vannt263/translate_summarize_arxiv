    "direct photon production due to small cross section of electromagnetic interactions is one among very few signals which can provide direct information on the partonic , early phase of interaction .",
    "penetrating probes , direct photons and dilepton pairs are traditionally considered to be one of the best probes for quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "direct photons are produced through different mechanisms ( compton scattering , quark annihilation , bremsstrahlung of quarks and gluons ) .",
    "decay of hadrons such as @xmath4- and @xmath5-mesons is a source of background for direct photon production .",
    "therefore it is important to establish general features of photon production in hadron - hadron ( @xmath8 etc . )",
    "collisions and then to search for their violation at extremal conditions ( high multiplicity particle density , high @xmath9 etc . ) taking place in hadron - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "the description of direct photon production in the framework of qcd @xcite and comparison with available experimental data reveal numerous ambiguities .",
    "some of them are theoretical and connected with the choice of the factorization scheme , renormalization , factorization and fragmentation scales and with considerations of higher order qcd corrections .",
    "the other ones are relevant to consistency among different experimental data sets .",
    "the third ones are phenomenological and are introduced to correct theory by the model dependent manner ( for example `` @xmath10''-smearing effect ) .",
    "nuclear effects such as multiple parton interactions , nuclear shadowing , energy loss are not small @xcite and should be taken into account for calculations of direct photon cross section in heavy ion collisions .",
    "these effects modify nuclear structure functions , photon fragmentation functions and add uncertainties in the theoretical calculations of cross sections .",
    "we use the concept of @xmath2-scaling to analyze numerous experimental data on direct photon cross sections for @xmath6 , @xmath11 and @xmath1 collisions at high @xmath12 and to make some predictions for @xmath13 and @xmath5 produced in @xmath6 and @xmath1 collisions at the rhic and lhc energies .",
    "the method of data analysis is complementary to a method of direct calculations developed in the framework of qcd and methods based on monte carlo generators .",
    "the use of the method allow us to obtain additional constraints in order to reduce the theoretical uncertainties and to estimate more reliably the photon cross section and background .",
    "the idea of @xmath2-scaling @xcite-@xcite is based on the assumptions that inclusive particle distribution of the process ( [ eq : r1 ] ) at high energies and high @xmath9 can be described in terms of the corresponding kinematic characteristics @xmath15 of the exclusive elementary sub - process @xcite and that the scaling function depending on a single variable @xmath2 exists and can be expressed via the dynamic quantities , invariant inclusive cross section @xmath16 of the process ( [ eq : r1 ] ) and particle multiplicity density @xmath17 .    the elementary parton - parton collision is considered as a binary sub - process which satisfies the condition    @xmath18    the equation reflects minimum recoil mass hypothesis in the elementary sub - process . to connect kinematic and structural characteristics of the interaction ,",
    "the coefficient @xmath19 is introduced .",
    "it is chosen in the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a mass constant and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are factors relating to the fractal structure of the colliding objects @xcite .",
    "the fractions @xmath24 and @xmath25 are determined to maximize the value of @xmath26 , simultaneously fulfilling the condition ( [ eq : r5 ] ) @xmath27 the variables @xmath28 are equal to unity along the phase space limit and cover the full phase space accessible at any energy .",
    "the scaling function @xmath29 is written in the form @xcite @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the inelastic cross section , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the center - of - mass energy squared of the corresponding @xmath34 and @xmath35 systems , @xmath3 is the atomic weight and @xmath36 is the average particle multiplicity density .",
    "the factor @xmath37 is the known function of the kinematic variables , the momenta and masses of the colliding and produced particles @xcite .",
    "the function is normalized as @xmath38 the equation allows us to give the physical meaning of the function @xmath39 as a probability density to form a particle with the corresponding value of the variable @xmath2 .    in accordance with",
    "the approach suggested in @xcite , the variable @xmath2 is taken in the form ( [ eq : r28 ] ) as a simple physically meaningful variable reflecting self - similarity and fractality as a general pattern of hadron production at high energies @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the minimal transverse energy of colliding constituents necessary to produce a real hadron in the reaction ( [ eq : r1 ] ) .",
    "the factor @xmath19 is given by ( [ eq : r8 ] ) and @xmath42 .",
    "the form of @xmath2 determines its variation range @xmath43 .",
    "these values are scale independent and kinematically accessible at any energy .",
    "one of the features of the procedure to construct @xmath29 and @xmath2 described above is the joint use of the experimental quantities characterizing hard ( @xmath16 ) and soft ( @xmath44 ) processes of particle interactions .",
    "let us clarify the physical meaning of the variable @xmath45 .",
    "the value @xmath46 is the minimal transverse energy of colliding constituents necessary to produce a real hadron in the reaction ( [ eq : r1 ] ) .",
    "it is assumed that two point - like and massless elementary constituents interact with each other in the initial state and convert into real hadrons in the final state .",
    "the conversion is not instant process and is called hadronization or particle formation .",
    "the microscopic space - time picture of the hadronization is not understood enough at present time .",
    "we assume that number of hadrons produced in the hard interaction of constituents is proportional to @xmath47",
    ". therefore the value @xmath48 corresponds to the energy density per one hadron produced in the sub - process .",
    "the factor @xmath49 is relative number of all initial configurations containing the constituents which carry the momentum fractions @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "this factor thus represents a tension in the considered sub - system with respect to the whole system . taking into account the qualitative scenario of hadron formation as a conversion of a point - like constituent into a real hadron we interpreted the variable @xmath2 as particle formation length",
