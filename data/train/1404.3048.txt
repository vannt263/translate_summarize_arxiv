    "the higgs boson with a mass of 125 gev was discovered at the lhc",
    ". however , the dynamical origin of electroweak ( ew ) symmetry breaking and of the higgs are still mysterious and would be explained by the physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "technicolor ( tc )  @xcite is a well - motivated model for the dynamical origin of ew symmetry breaking in a way similar to the established mechanism in qcd which breaks the chiral symmetry ( and hence the ew symmetry as well ) dynamically via the fermion pair condensate .",
    "however , the original tc was ruled out a long time ago by the notorious flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) problem , and more dramatically by the recent discovery of the 125 gev higgs which can not be accounted for by the tc dynamics of a simple qcd scale - up .",
    "fortunately , both problems are simultaneously solved by walking technicolor ( wtc )  @xcite , which was proposed based on the scale - symmetric dynamics of the ladder schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equation : with the scale symmetry , wtc predicted a large anomalous dimension @xmath4 as a solution to the fcnc problem , and at the same time predicted a light composite higgs  known as a `` technidilaton '' ( td )  @xcite  that is a pseudo - nambu - goldstone ( ng ) boson of the scale symmetry broken spontaneously ( and also explicitly ) by the technifermion condensate .",
    "it was shown that the td can account for the 125 gev higgs , with couplings that are consistent with the current lhc data of the 125 gev higgs ( see below )  @xcite .",
    "thus the origin of the higgs mass is dynamically explained by the scale of the chiral condensate in wtc .",
    "the mass of the td as a pseudo - ng boson comes from the nonperturbative trace anomaly due to the chiral condensate and can be estimated through the partially conserved dilatation current ( pcdc ) relation  @xcite .",
    "a precise ladder evaluation of @xmath5 based on this pcdc relation reads  @xcite : @xmath6 $ ] , where @xmath7 ( pagels - stokar formula ) , with @xmath8 being the number of the electroweak doublets .",
    "note the scaling @xmath9 , which implies that a light td @xmath10 is naturally realized for @xmath11 ( as well as @xmath12 ) as in the large-@xmath13 qcd .",
    ", can be obtained  @xcite , when we take @xmath14 ( @xmath15 for @xmath16 in the one - family model , see below ) .",
    "amazingly , this value of @xmath17 turned out to be consistent with the lhc higgs data ( best fit @xmath18 )  @xcite ]   ( and @xmath19 ) would result in the so - called @xmath20 parameter problem  @xcite .",
    "the large @xmath20 from the tc sector , however , is not necessarily in conflict with the experimental value of the @xmath20 from the precision ew measurements , since the contributions from the tc sector can easily be cancelled by strong mixing with the sm fermion contribution through the extended tc ( etc ) interactions , as in the fermion delocalization of the higgsless model  @xcite . moreover , even within the tc sector alone , there exists a way to resolve this problem as demonstrated in the holographic model , where where we can reduce @xmath21 by tuning the holographic parameter ( roughly corresponding to increasing the technirho mass @xmath22 ) , in a way consistent with the td mass of 125 gev and all the current lhc data for the 125 gev higgs  @xcite . ]",
    "more recently , in another approach using holographic wtc  @xcite it was shown  @xcite that the strong gluon dynamics via the large technigluon condensate can realize a parametrically massless td limit @xmath23 and hence naturally realize @xmath24 gev , consistent with the lhc higgs data .",
    "similar arguments for realizing a parametrically light dilaton were given in somewhat different contexts  @xcite .",
    "amazingly , the recent lattice results  @xcite in fact indicate that the @xmath25 gauge theory with eight fundamental fermions ( @xmath26 qcd ) possesses a walking nature , with the anomalous dimension @xmath27 .",
    "most remarkably , it has been shown in the lattice",
    "@xmath26 qcd  @xcite that there in fact exists a flavor - singlet scalar meson that is as light as the pions for a small fermion - mass region , which thus can be a composite higgs ( in the form of the td ) in the chiral limit .",
    "thus , special interest in the context of lattice studies has recently been paid to the one - family model ( or farhi - susskind model )  @xcite as a candidate theory for the wtc .",
    "the model is the most straightforward version of the extended tc ( etc ) model  @xcite which incorporates the mechanism of producing masses for the sm fermions .",
    "the one - family model consists of @xmath28 copies of a whole generation of the sm fermions ; therefore , the tc sector of the model is a @xmath29 gauge theory with eight fundamental dirac fermions , @xmath26 ( i.e. , four weak doublets , @xmath30 , with the ng boson decay constant @xmath31 gev ) .",
    "the global chiral symmetry - breaking pattern of the one - family model is @xmath32 , which is described by the usual nonlinear chiral lagrangian based on the manifold @xmath33 in terms of the 63 ng bosons .",
    "it is further straightforwardly extended to a scale - invariant version so as to incorporate the td , @xmath34 , as a composite higgs  @xcite .",
    "the chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) of the scale - invariant version can also be formulated by assigning the chiral order counting @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "three of the 63 ng bosons are eaten by the sm weak gauge bosons , when the sm gauge interactions are switched on , while the other 60 remain as physical states (  technipions \" ) , all acquiring mass to become pseudo - ng bosons by the sm gauging and the etc gauging , which explicitly breaks the chiral symmetry @xmath36 down to the symmetry corresponding to the ew symmetry .",
    "the gauge couplings of these explicit breakings are small and perturbative , and therefore the masses of the technipions may be estimated by the dashen formula at the lowest - order perturbation , just like the estimate of the @xmath37 mass difference in qcd .",
    "it turns out that the masses of all the technipions are drastically enhanced by the walking dynamics of wtc  @xcite . in the case of the one - family model , the masses of the walking technipions",
    "were explicitly estimated  @xcite to be of @xmath38 ( tev ) ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : properties ] below ) , suggesting a new possibility that the technirhos decay directly to the sm particles , rather than through the technipions .    in this paper",
    ", we consider another type of the technihadrons  vector resonances ( here we are confined to the flavor - nonsinglet ones , called  technirho mesons \" )  which are expected to exist as typical bound states in the generic dynamical ew symmetry - breaking scenarios , not restricted to wtc or the one - family model . in the case of wtc",
    "we extend the scale - invariant version of the low - energy effective theory  @xcite  i.e. , the case of the one - family model based on @xmath32  @xcite  in a way that includes the technirhos by using the hidden local symmetry ( hls )  @xcite   instead of @xmath32 . as we discuss later , however , it would be less interesting compared with the technirho in the lhc phenomenology and is not discussed in this paper . ] .",
    "similar discussions on the technirho s based on the hls were done for the one - doublet model with @xmath39 without the scale symmetry / td [ the  breaking electroweak symmetry strongly \" ( bess ) model ]  @xcite .",
    "this is the first study of the hls for the one - family model as well as its scale - invariant version , which implies a novel salient lhc phenomenology involving the td and the colored technirho .",
    "it is to be noted that the chpt was formulated for the hls lagrangian  @xcite and can be extended to the scale - invariant version of the hls in the same way as in the case without the hls  @xcite , although we do not include the loop effects in this paper .",
    "based on the scale - invariant hls , we first evaluate the constraint on the technirho meson masses from the current lhc data , and then future lhc phenomenology is discussed .",
    "we find that the color - octet technirho produced via the drell - yan ( dy ) process which decays to the td along with the gluon is especially interesting as a discovery channel at the lhc to probe the one - family wtc .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we formulate the scale - invariant hls based on the manifold @xmath0_{\\rm global } \\times su(8)_{\\rm local}/su(8)_v$ ] , including the td , technipions , and technirho mesons . in sec .",
    "iii the decay widths and branching ratios of the technirho mesons in the one - family wtc are discussed . in sec .",
    "iv we explore the lhc phenomenology of the technirho mesons and place limits on the masses from the currently available lhc data on searches for new spin-1 resonances .",
    "we then discuss the discovery channels of the technirho mesons , which include the td as the daughter particle of the parent technirho mesons .",
    "a summary is given in sec .",
    "v. the explicit forms of the technirho couplings relevant to the lhc phenomenology and the partial decay widths are presented in appendices a and b , respectively .",
    "in this section , based on the hls formalism  @xcite , we give a formulation of the scale - invariant hls for the one - family wtc model , which includes the td and technipions , as well as the technirho mesons as the hls gauge bosons .",
    "the hls formalism makes it straightforward to simultaneously incorporate both the external ( sm ) gauge and hls ( vector - meson ) interactions , in contrast to other approaches for the inclusion of the vector mesons into the chiral lagrangian .",
    "it actually turns out to be crucial for studying the lhc phenomenology , as will be seen below .",
    "furthermore , the chpt for the systematic loop expansion has been developed only in the hls formalism , although the vector mesons can also be incorporated into the chiral lagrangian by other formalisms which are equivalent to the hls lagrangian at the on - shell tree level  @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian for the technipion is expressed as the usual nonlinear sigma model based on the manifold @xmath40 .",
    "the td is incorporated by forcing the chiral effective theory to be scale - invariant through the introduction of the compensating nonlinear field @xmath41 , which transforms under scale transformation as @xmath42 , so that @xmath43 does scale nonlinearly as @xmath44 , where @xmath43 and @xmath17 are the td field and its decay constant , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the resultant one - family scale - invariant action is explicitly given by the lagrangian  @xcite @xmath45 + \\frac{f_\\phi^2}{2}\\partial_\\mu\\chi(x)\\partial^\\mu\\chi(x)\\ , , \\label{lag : int } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 ( with @xmath47 being the decay constant of the ng bosons ) transforms as @xmath48 , with @xmath49 , as does the covariant derivative @xmath50 , where @xmath36 is formally fully gauged by the external gauge fields @xmath51 .",
    "the action for the lagrangian ( [ lag : int ] ) is invariant under the gauged-@xmath36 symmetry as well as the scale symmetry . in the realistic application to wtc , the external gauge fields",
    "are restricted to the sm gauge fields of @xmath3 .",
    "besides the scale - invariant term , there exists a scale - anomaly term which reproduces the td mass and as well as terms involving the td coupling to the sm fields  @xcite .",
    "now , it is straightforward to introduce the technirho into the lagrangian ( [ lag : int ] ) in the standard manner of the hls formalism  @xcite .",
    "the hls can be made explicit by writing @xmath52 , where the @xmath53 are parametrized as @xmath54 with the broken generators @xmath55 and the fictitious ng bosons @xmath56 ( not to be confused with the scalar meson ) along with the decay constant @xmath57 , which are to be absorbed into the hls .",

    "<S> we formulate a scale - invariant hidden local symmetry ( hls ) as a low - energy effective theory of the walking technicolor ( wtc ) which includes the technidilaton , technipions , and technirho mesons as the low - lying spectra . as a benchmark for lhc phenomenology , we in particular focus on the one - family model of wtc having eight technifermion flavors , which can be at energy scales relevant to the reach of the lhc described by the scale - invariant hls based on the manifold @xmath0_{\\rm global } \\times su(8)_{\\rm local}/su(8)_v$ ] , where @xmath1 is the hls and the global @xmath2 symmetry is partially gauged by @xmath3 of the standard model . based on the scale - invariant hls </S>",
    "<S> , we evaluate the coupling properties of the technirho mesons and place limits on the masses from the current lhc data . </S>",
    "<S> then , implications for future lhc phenomenology are discussed by focusing on the technirho mesons produced through the drell - yan process . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the color - octet technirho decaying to the technidilaton along with the gluon is of interest as the discovery channel at the lhc , which would provide a characteristic signature to probe the one - family wtc . </S>"
