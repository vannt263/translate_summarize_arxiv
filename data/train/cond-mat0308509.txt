    "the gonihedric spin model was first introduced by savvidy in relation to a discretized model for a tensionless string theory @xcite , but very soon the spin model gained interest by itself .",
    "also its extension to a self - interacting surfaces ( @xmath0 ) showed a very rich family of models with different kind of critical points and interesting dynamical properties @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "extensive numerical and theoretical work appeared @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite and some interest about the glassiness of the 3-dimensional gonihedric model arised @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "this is precisely the aspect of the model that has motivated us to study the 2-dimensional version of the model .",
    "its trivial thermodynamics motivates us to investigate whether this model also has glassy behavior or not .",
    "this would provide a toy model for glassy phenomena without inherent disorder on the couplings .",
    "so the spin model we are going to investigate is related to a model of loops in 2 dimensions .",
    "we are going to compare this model and the results we obtained from analogous simulations in a 3 dimensional version of this spin model @xcite .",
    "but before we go into the analysis of the model let s define it in terms of spin variables .    consider the following hamiltonian    @xmath1}\\sigma_i\\sigma_j\\sigma_k\\sigma_l \\nonumber\\ ] ]    in a two dimensional lattice}\\ ] ] + the reason is that the number of neighbors changes from 3d to 2d , thus the couplings has to change too as we will argue . ] , where @xmath2 means sum over nearest neighbors , @xmath3 means sum over next to nearest neighbors , and @xmath4 $ ] means over spins forming plaquettes on the lattice .    this hamiltonian has some odd characteristics .",
    "the most important of all is that the space of symmetric vacua is extremely large , in fact it is exponentially large with the dimension of the lattice @xmath5 . in particular",
    ", the simultaneous flip of all the spins that belong to any set of non - crossing lines leaves the energy of the ferromagnetic ground state unchanged @xcite .",
    "this symmetry is even larger in the @xmath6 case where the lines can cross each other .",
    "this provides a very special landscape for the energy function of our model that in its 3 dimensional version makes the system exhibit a very clear glassy behavior associated to a thermodynamical phase transition @xcite .",
    "this is precisely the aim of this work : to determine whether or not the same kind of behavior can be found in 2 dimensions given that the 2d model has no thermodynamical phase transition .",
    "let us first see the relation between this model and the loop model we announced . if we look at the energy of a given configuration we can see that due to the precise fine tuning of the couplings all the energy is concentrated at the bending points of the loop ( surface in this 3d case ) that is the boundary between the two different phases of the system ( i.e. between plus and minus spins ) , and that wherever there is a crossing of this surface with itself ( or with another loop ) there is another concentration of extra energy .",
    "so at the end of the day we can write the energy of the spin model ( or the loop model ) as follows @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the number of bending points and @xmath9 the number of self - crossing points of the loop that separates the plus and minus spins regions .",
    "this is exactly the same that happens in the 3 dimensional version of the model .",
    "in fact the couplings are precisely chosen to exhibit these features .",
    "but all this has very different consequences for 2 dimensions or 3 dimensions .",
    "the main difference between this 2d loop model and the corresponding 3d surface model is that the action of the surface in 3d is proportional to the linear extent of the surface ( see fig.[2 - 3-dexample]a ) and the roughness of it , while the action for the loop is not depending on how big it is but on how many times it bends ( see fig.[2 - 3-dexample]b ) .",
    "thus in 2 dimensions the energy of the loop do not depend on its size but on the shape of it ( although the energy barriers do eventually depend on the size of the loop ) .",
    "let s now take a look at the thermodynamical properties of this spin model taking as a reference its 3 dimensional counterpart @xcite@xcite .",
    "let s begin with the special case of @xmath10 that is exactly solvable in infinite volume and reducible to an easy - computable sum for finite volume .",
    "the exact solution for the model with @xmath11 shows us that there is no phase transition at finite temperature .",
    "if we take a look at fig.[enek0 ] we will see the infinite volume energy function and susceptibility compared to the numerical results of simulations and to the exact finite volume calculation .",
    "all the discordances between simulations and the infinite volume calculations are due to finite volume effects as we can see comparing the simulations with the exact finite volume calculations .    for the other cases with @xmath0",
    "there is no infinite volume exact solution nor easy - computable finite - volume expression but the simulations performed do not show great differences with the @xmath12 case ( see fig.[enekno0 ] ) .",
    "the only remarkable difference is the    appearance of a second structure for sufficiently large @xmath13 .",
    "this second structure can be interpreted as the appearance of a new energy level for the plaquette variables .",
    "this has been studied to see whether it evolves into a peak at large volumes , but no volume dependence of this structure has been found , so there is no evidence of phase transition .    on the other hand the same model in three dimensions exhibits a quite complex phase space .",
    "for @xmath11 there is a critical temperature @xmath14 where the system changes from ordered to disordered phase through a first order phase transition , and a second temperature @xmath15 that is between two different dynamical phases : a glassy phase and a supercooled phase ( see fig.[3dphasespace ] ) @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "increasing @xmath13 we find    from certain value on that this second temperature @xmath15 either is very close to the thermodynamical temperature @xmath14 or they coincide , and that this thermodynamical phase transition changes from first to second order .",
    "thus we have seen that this models from 3 dimensions to 2 dimensions changes a lot its thermodynamical behavior . from having first / second order phase transitions ( depending on the value of @xmath13 ) on 3d to trivial thermodynamics without any phase transition on 2d .",
    "but we also want to know whether there is a great difference or not in they dynamical properties .",
    "in particular we want to know if the slow dynamics and the glassy behavior remains on the 2 dimensional model .",
    "we will move now to the dynamical properties of the model .",
    "we shall report here only the @xmath6 case case . ] .    to study the dynamics of this system we will consider a two - time correlator of local observables @xcite @xmath16 where the sum runs over all the sites in the lattice , and the variable @xmath17 is the energy of the site @xmath18 at the time @xmath19 .",
    "this object , in equilibrium , should be independent of @xmath20 , but as we    can see in fig.[cdtslow2d ] below some temperature this function happens to depend on the waiting time @xmath20 , such observation is identical to the one made for the 3 dimensional case where an even larger dependence of this autocorrelation function on the waiting time appeared below @xmath15 ( see fig.[cdtslow3d ] ) .",
    "this is not per se a clear evidence for glassy behavior of the model yet , so we will continue with the program we followed with the 3 dimensional model .",
    "thus let s fit the curves that look @xmath20-independent ( i.e. the curves that should be above the hypothetical glassy transition temperature@xmath15 ) .",
    "the fitting function will be of the form @xmath21 which is an stretched exponential .",
    "as you can see in fig.[cdtslow2d]a the agreement between the fit and the simulations is rather good , i.e. @xmath22 ( which we know by construction of the correlation function ) were within the interval of confidence of the fitted value ] .",
    "now we can plot the fitted values of @xmath23 against temperature , and we see that it increases as we lower the temperature as if it liked to diverge at some point . if we fit this points using a function of the form @xmath24 as we did in 3 dimensions , we ll find a good parameterization of the divergence ( see fig.[tau2d ] ) although there is still something that is not completely compatible with this fit .",
    "the problem with this fit is that the fitted `` critical '' temperature @xmath25 is not consistent with the point where the autocorrelation function began to depend on the waiting time , as it should .",
    "this is why we should analyze more carefully this autocorrelation function .",
    "looking more carefully at this autocorrelation function we can see that the dependence in the waiting time @xmath20 disappears as we increase it .",
    "this means that the thermalization of these two time functions is extremely slow , but that could be non - glassy - like . in fig.[thermal.1 ]",
    "we can see this convergence of the autocorrelation functions as we increase the waiting time .    to explore",
    "better the dynamics behavior of this model we can perform other type of experiments in our system .",
    "for example we can prepare our system in a specific configuration , for example a lattice with two different coexisting vacua , one inside the other ( one possibility could be layer - like vacua inside ferromagnetic one ) and look at the decay process of the system to the equilibrium .",
    "the problem with this tests is that as there is no ordered phase in this model , we can not prepare the system in an initial configuration composed by two different coexisting vacuas and pretend that they are more disordered than the equilibrium - like configurations at the temperatures we are examining , as it is in the 3 dimensional case ( fig.[3ddecay ] shows the 3d decay of a perturbed vacua to the unperturbed one .",
    "it is easy to see the different behaviors in terms of temperature ) . in spite of this we performed those simulations and found that the decay behaved in the same way for all the range of temperatures ( fig.[2ddecay]a and fig.[2ddecay]b are two    examples of this decays at both sides of the hypothetical @xmath15 ) .",
    "the magnitude we used to study this decay in two dimensions is the energy difference with the equilibrium .",
    "if we look at the value of the fitted exponent @xmath26 of the function ( [ streched ] ) that we have also used in this experiments , we can see that they are really close to one , and this suggests that the behavior may not be glassy but ` usual ' albeit rather slow exponential decay .    in the analysis of the glassiness of the system we can introduce a new observable ; the @xmath27 parameter @xcite .",
    "this parameter is defined in the following way : after evolving a single system @xmath20 monte carlo steps , we make two copies of the system and let them evolve independently , then the @xmath27 of a local observable is the overlap of this observable between the two independent copies of the system . in our case",
    "we will use the local spin variables @xmath28 then , using this @xmath27 parameter and the time overlap of the same local magnitude , @xmath29    we can perform different kind of analysis .",
    "one of those is the following .",
    "it s known that the system must satisfy the relation @xmath30 if the we are in an ordinary non - glassy phase .",
    "as we can see in fig.[qdec]a and fig.[qdec]b there are temperatures is already a temperature where , at waiting times we are considering , the energy auto - correlators are not @xmath20 independent ] for which the behavior of the @xmath27 parameter with respect to the @xmath31 two times auto - correlator is what we expected , while there are lower temperatures , like in fig.[qdec]c and fig.[qdec]d where the relation ( [ non - glassy ] ) is not satisfied at large enough times , for the value of @xmath20 we simulate , although the discrepancy region is moving to larger times as we increase @xmath20 as if it would like to follow ( [ non - glassy ] ) for large @xmath20 ( see fig.[convergecdq ] ) .      at this point",
    "we have concluded the analysis of all our simulations without any clear reason to believe that this 2 dimensional version of savvidy s gonihedric model has really glassy behavior ; on the contrary it seems to exhibit only very slow dynamics not related to real glassiness of the model .",
    "this has to be further investigated to clear out what type of dynamics is this model developing .",
    "also @xmath0 has to be investigated although we think it will follow the same kind of behavior that the @xmath6 case .",
    "there exist a way to extent this model to one coupled to gravity . to couple it to gravity we will put our spin model in a random lattice built from quadrangular pieces . in this way we will keep the behavior of the loops and add the gravity degrees of freedom . in order to make the matrix model solvable",
    "( or approximately solvable ) we will make the loops highly self - interacting , that means that the loops will        never cross themselves .",
    "this corresponds to the @xmath32 limit in the model we presented above . in fig.[random lattice ] we can see an example of this kind of quadrangulations . from this picture",
    "we can extract the weights of each interaction term in the matrix model that will represent the partition function of our system .",
    "let s see what those terms mean .",
    "first of all there will be the bulk term ( in other words , plaquette that is not crossed by any loop ) , then we have to consider a term were a plaquette is crossed by one loop without bending through it and finally the term were the loop crossing the plaquette bends in one direction or the other .",
    "these three building blocks of the random lattices are presented graphically in fig.[intterms ] with the corresponding term of the matrix model that will generate them .",
    "as we can see we are considering the most general case where all the couplings are different but in our specific case we will impose the condition @xmath33 due to the fact that a straight piece of loop do not contribute with any amount of energy to the action , so the coupling has to be equal to the bulk coupling .",
    "in addition to those terms we have to put the kinetic term for the two matrices , i.e. the quadratic terms @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "so finally the matrix model that will represent our loop model coupled to gravity will be , @xmath36\\big ) \\nonumber\\ ] ]    now that we have found the matrix model that will reproduce our loop model coupled to gravity we only need to develop its solution . to our knowledge",
    "this model has not been solved exactly .",
    "although very similar matrix models have been indeed solved @xcite their solution can not be applied to our matrix model .",
    "let s proceed then to the approximation to the solution . to this aim",
    "we are going to rescale the @xmath37 matrix in the form @xmath38 so that the action will have the following appearance . @xmath39+\\tr[b^2 +    \\lambda a^2b^2 + \\tilde    gabab ] \\nonumber\\ ] ] where we have made some redefinitions like @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "now we are going to pay attention to the @xmath42dependent part . as the action @xmath43 is quadratic in @xmath42 we should be able to integrate out the @xmath42 matrix and find a one matrix model equivalent to the one we are using now .",
    "the integration we are facing now is the following @xmath44-     \\tilde g\\ \\tr[abab]\\big)\\ ] ] here we are going to interpret the first part of the action as the free action ( and rename @xmath45 ) and the second part as the interaction , so we can do perturbation theory and re - sum all the diagrams at the end .",
    "but before we calculate diagrams we need to know the free propagator of the @xmath42 matrix , and to reach this we add some external currents and perform the quadratic integration is shown in detail how to make this calculation and find @xmath46 . ] .",
    "so finally we find the propagator @xmath47_{il;kj }   \\label{propagator}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 a determinant coming from the b integration .",
    "once we have found the propagator we can proceed with the diagrammatic .",
    "we will only consider the connected diagrams .",
    "the feynman rules for the diagrams will be those shown in fig.[feynmanrules ]        to order @xmath49 in the interaction term there will be also a factor @xmath50 due to the expansion of the exponential , and a combinatorial factor of @xmath51 coming from the reordering of the interaction terms ( in fig.[diagrams ] we can see the kind of diagrams that will contribute ) .",
    "so finally all connected diagrams add up to @xmath52^{-1})^n \\bigg]\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad=\\tr\\bigg[\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{(-2\\tilde g)^n}{n }    \\bigg(a\\otimes a[\\mathbb{i}\\otimes m+      m\\otimes\\mathbb{i}]^{-1}\\bigg)^n\\bigg]\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad=\\frac{-1}{2}\\tr\\bigg[log\\bigg(\\mathbb{i}\\otimes\\mathbb{i}+    \\frac{2\\tilde   ga\\otimes a}{2      \\mathbb{i}\\otimes\\mathbb{i}+\\lambda(\\mathbb{i}\\otimes a^2 +      a^2\\otimes\\mathbb{i})}\\bigg ) \\bigg]\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have recovered the explicit form of @xmath53 in terms of @xmath37 . thus exponentiating this last expression we recover all connected and disconnected diagrams ; i.e. the integral ( [ integral.1 ] ) we were trying to calculate .",
    "@xmath54\\ -    \\tilde g\\ & & { \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!}\\tr[abab]\\big)=\\nonumber\\\\ = \\tilde\\textrm{z}(0,m)\\ exp\\bigg\\{\\frac{-1}{2 }    \\tr\\bigg[log\\bigg(\\mathbb{i}\\otimes\\mathbb{i}\\ + \\ & & { \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!}\\frac{2\\tilde   ga\\otimes a}{2      \\mathbb{i}\\otimes\\mathbb{i}+\\lambda(\\mathbb{i}\\otimes a^2 +      a^2\\otimes\\mathbb{i})}\\bigg)\\bigg]\\bigg\\}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    so finally we have found an expression for the integration of the @xmath42 matrix . in this expression @xmath55^{-\\frac{n}{2}}$ ] that can be included in the effective action as @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "this means that we have rewritten our two matrix model in terms of a one matrix model .",
    "so now we can diagonalize our remaining @xmath37 matrix and integrate over the rotational degrees of freedom to leave our partition function in the form @xmath57\\big)\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\int \\bigg(\\prod_{i=1}^n\\   { \\mathrm{d}}a_i\\bigg)\\delta^2(a)exp\\big\\{-\\frac{n}{\\tilde    g}\\textrm{s}_{eff}\\big(\\{a\\}\\big)\\big\\}\\nonumber   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the usual van der monde determinant and @xmath59 is the following @xmath60    since we are working in terms of eigenvalues we can use standard procedures to try to solve the model .",
    "using saddle point approximation we arrive to a set of coupled equations that look quite difficult to solve exactly . in the @xmath61",
    "limit those equations read @xmath62\\nonumber \\\\&&=2g{-\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\:\\int}{\\mathrm{d}}b\\frac{\\rho(b)}{a - b}=    -g(\\omega(a+i\\epsilon)+\\omega(a - i\\epsilon))\\quad , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where as usual @xmath63 $ ] and the resolvent @xmath64 is defined to be equal to @xmath65 this self - consistent equation has to be analyzed carefully to see whether there is any fixed point in the set of parameters that allowed us to pas to the continuum .      in the conclusions of this second part",
    "we may comment that , since the fixed geometry model we have studied in the first part does not posses any thermodynamical singularity , even for @xmath32 , we would naively expect the present matrix model not to exhibit any scaling limit , but this issue deserves further analysis .",
    "related to this matrix model there are other matrix models that can be exactly solved @xcite .",
    "although those other models have some critical differences , their solutions may give some hints on how to exactly solve the model we are interested in .",
    "in fact some of the solved models can be found as an special limit of ours . that could be used as a test or a guide to find the solution .",
    "* aknowledgments *    we express our gratitude to the organizers of the workshop on random geometry krakow 2003 for a most enjoyable atmosphere and hospitality .",
    "i would like to thank a.dominguez and l. tagliacozzo for interesting discussions and encouragement .",
    "the research contained in this talk is supported by the european network eurogrid and for a cirit grant 2001fi-00387 .",
    "to find the propagator we begin with the free action and add an external source . in our case this will lead to @xmath66\\nonumber\\ ] ] then , to reabsorb the external field @xmath67 into the @xmath42 field we do a linear change of variables @xmath68 and quadratize the action . doing the inverse procedure we find @xmath69 so at the end the integral is @xmath70\\big\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\big(det[m]\\big)^{-1}\\ exp\\big\\{\\tr[cmc]\\big\\ }   \\label{integral.2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath71 matrix can be determined from the equation @xmath72 let s solve this equation to find the explicit form of the @xmath71 matrix . to this aim",

    "so if @xmath73 is the matrix that diagonalizes it @xmath74 the primed matrices correspond to the non - primed ones after the rotation .",
