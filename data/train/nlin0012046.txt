    "the classical and quantum mechanical study of time - dependent hamiltonian systems are generic and important .",
    "they span a wide spectrum of subjects ranging from interaction between atoms and radiation @xcite , adiabatic @xcite and non - adiabatic @xcite berry phase , time - dependent harmonic oscillators @xcite and quantum motion of a particle in a paul trap @xcite , to time - dependent mean - field theory ( cranking model @xcite ) in particular and the time - dependent shell model @xcite in general .",
    "the question of the existence of invariants ( constants of motion ) is one of central importance in the study of any dynamical system , be it classical or quantal .",
    "a basic theorem of classical mechanics asserts that if the number of independent invariants , satisfying certain conditions , is equal to the number of degrees of freedom , then the motion can be reduced to quadratures , or equivalently , an action - angle transformation to a hamiltonian dependent only on the actions can be found @xcite .",
    "such systems are integrable .",
    "the lack of sufficient number of invariants invariably leads to a phase space that has a nonzero measure of _ chaotic _ trajectories @xcite . for time - independent hamiltonian systems",
    "the hamiltonian itself is an invariant .",
    "however , when the hamiltonian is an explicit function of time , it is no more an invariant , and this is of course a reflection of the non - conservation of energy .",
    "various methods have been used to obtain approximate solutions for time - dependent problems , e.g. , the adiabatic approximation , the sudden approximation , time - dependent perturbation techniques , etc .",
    "the most widely studied time - dependent hamiltonian system is the time - dependent harmonic oscillator ( tdho ) .",
    "it has long been a problem of considerable interest because of its varied applications in different areas of physics , for instance in molecular physics , quantum chemistry , quantum optics and plasma physics .",
    "the hamiltonian of this system is given by , @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are conjugate canonical variables .",
    "the adiabatic invariant for this system was originally given at the first solvay congress in 1911 when the hamiltonian of this system was used as an approximate hamiltonian for the slowly lengthening pendulum @xcite .",
    "the study of this one - dimensional tdho was greatly advanced due to the work of lewis @xcite and riesenfeld @xcite .",
    "lewis @xcite determined the exact invariant by applying kruskal s asymptotic method @xcite and showed that a previously known adiabatic invariant was in fact an exact invariant .",
    "later lewis and riesenfeld ( lr ) @xcite determined that same invariant by starting with the assumption of the existence of an explicitly time - dependent , homogeneous and quadratic invariant of the form given by , @xmath4 , \\label{inv1}\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath5 and @xmath6 are time - dependent real functions and @xmath7 satisfies the condition , @xmath8 here @xmath9 denotes the usual poisson bracket . from the above two equations and after some calculations they derived the exact invariant as , @xmath10 ,   \\label{inv2}\\ ] ] with @xmath11 satisfying the subsidiary condition @xmath12 this more complicated , nonlinear , differential equation represented an advance due to the reason that _ any _ particular solution @xmath11 of the above equation would give the exact invariant @xmath7 for _ all _ initial conditions of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the above technique actually predates the work of lewis and riesenfeld in a slightly different context , and we briefly point this out .",
    "we note that the equation of motion of the tdho is , @xmath13 .",
    "this is of the same form as the time - independent , one - dimensional schrdinger equation , if we assume that @xmath14 represents the spatial coordinate and @xmath3 , the wave - function . according to an early work by milne ( 1930 ) @xcite , it is possible to solve this schrdinger equation using the knowledge of any particular solution of the eq .",
    "( [ coef ] ) , after proper identifications .",
    "therefore , any particular solution of the subsidiary condition can also give the exact solution for the tdho .",
    "lewis @xcite attempted to give an interpretation of @xmath7 as the most general homogeneous quadratic invariant possible for the hamiltonian of the one - dimensional tdho .",
    "a more natural and physical interpretation has been suggested by eliezer and gray @xcite in terms of two - dimensional auxiliary motion , i.e. , in terms of a two - dimensional uncoupled tdho .",
    "they showed that the above subsidiary condition eq .",
    "( [ coef ] ) is the radial equation of motion for this two - dimensional system and the invariant @xmath7 is proportional to the conserved angular momentum of this auxiliary motion .",
    "gnther and leach @xcite interpreted @xmath7 in terms of canonical transformations and under their transformation the invariant @xmath7 became the hamiltonian of the one - dimensional time - independent harmonic oscillator of unit frequency .    besides these previous interpretations of @xmath7 , we can interpret the form of @xmath7 chosen by lewis and riesenfeld ( lr ) @xcite from the lie - algebraic point of view .",
    "the hamiltonian of the one - dimensional tdho is formed by the dynamical variables @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "these two dynamical variables together with @xmath17 are generators of the closed @xmath0 algebra under the poisson bracket operation and @xmath7 was chosen in @xcite as the linear combination of these generators . generalizing the lr - invariant from the lie - algebraic point of view",
    ", we expect that if any time - dependent hamiltonian be the combination of the generators of any closed algebra , an invariant would be a linear combination of the generators of that closed algebra with time - dependent coefficients .",
    "the integrability of the one - dimensional tdho is not surprising , because this is a linear system . we know",
    ", one - dimensional time - dependent hamiltonians usually lead to non - integrability , e.g. , a simple pendulum whose length varies in time . except for the adiabatic or small oscillation approximations ,",
    "this was the problem posed by lorentz at the above mentioned solvay congress and the solutions have the possibility of displaying chaos .",
    "now a natural question is if there exist one - dimensional time - dependent nonlinear hamiltonians which are also integrable ?",
    "in fact , the singular oscillator with a centrifugal force potential provides an important example whose kinematics is still within the @xmath0 algebra . in the second section ,",
    "we have discussed such a nonlinear hamiltonian and we have also derived its invariant from our new lie - algebraic interpretation of the lr - invariant . using this hamiltonian",
    "we have constructed an integrable , area preserving , nonlinear map and derived its exact invariant with a knowledge of its fixed points .",
    "we have determined the classical time - evolution ( perron - frobenius ) operator following a recent method elucidated by rau @xcite .",
    "this method was originally used for solving the quantum liouville - bloch equation , but we have applied this in the classical case and have been able to show the one - to - one correspondence between this nonlinear map and the linear map ( derived from the hamiltonian of the one - dimensional tdho ) . in the third section , we have studied the quantum dynamics of the nonlinear map and again we have used rau s method to determine the quantum time - evolution operator . this identical approach to classical and quantum dynamics helps us to show , rather trivially , the exact one - to - one correspondence between the classical and the quantal .",
    "our study also has the dimension of interpreting the mathematics of the @xmath0 algebra from a dynamical systems viewpoint .",
    "for instance , we derive powers of non - commuting products of exponentials of the @xmath0 algebra .",
    "this reveals when the powers can degenerate to the identity , something that is immediately clear from the dynamics of the underlying system due to the presence of degenerate periodic orbits .",
    "first , we will describe the general hamiltonian of which an important special case constitutes the rest of the paper . for the existence of an invariant for the one - dimensional tdho , the subsidiary condition eq .",
    "( [ coef ] ) has to be integrated with _ some _ initial conditions , that is we should be able to determine a particular solution .",
    "the subsidiary condition , given in eq . ( [ coef ] ) , is a nonlinear , time - dependent , equation and its integrability is not immediately obvious .",
    "if we assume @xmath18 as a position variable , say @xmath3 , then eq . ( [ coef ] ) is the equation of motion corresponding to the hamiltonian given by , @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "this is a time - dependent hamiltonian , and has also been studied for long : it was studied in part by lewis and leach @xcite , camiz _ et .",
    "al . _ and pedrosa _",
    "@xcite studied this hamiltonian quantum mechanically .",
    "the new nonlinear force in the system is a _",
    "` centrifugal force ' _ and it appears in many integrable systems , including the celebrated calogero - sutherland - moser @xcite many - body hamiltonian .    the hamiltonian in eq . ( [ ham2 ] ) , is formed by the dynamical variables @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "these two variables together with @xmath17 , also form the @xmath0 closed algebra . following our algebraic interpretation of @xmath7 , we can assume the invariant of this nonlinear hamiltonian to be of the form , @xmath23 again , by the same substitutions and identical procedures we get @xmath24 with the same subsidiary condition as given in eq .",
    "( [ coef ] ) .",
    "it is also possible to determine this invariant using time - dependent canonical transformations @xcite , however , our algebraic method accomplishes this more elegantly . in this case , the equation of motion and the subsidiary condition are the _ same _ nonlinear equation , but the fact that we need only one particular solution of this equation to determine the invariant shows the power of the methodology and the integrability of the above hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ ham2 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ strobo ] we show a special case corresponding to @xmath25 where the existence of the invariant is reflected in the regular structures .",
    "now we use the above to construct a nonlinear integrable map .",
    "integrable discrete systems , or maps , have been intensely studied for some time now and many interesting methods and results have been found .",
    "integrable maps are important for the following reasons .",
    "firstly , studying the dynamics of a mapping is more simpler than the dynamics of a continuous system since it involves direct iteration .",
    "secondly , if one wants to study numerically any integrable continuous system , it is absurd to use non - integrable numerical schemes which destroy the basic properties of the system",
    ". therefore , for numerical studies of any integrable system , one has to find a discrete integrable version of the system .",
    "the discrete map we discuss below , or extensions thereof , for instance , may be used in the numerical studies of the calogero - sutherland - moser model .",
    "lastly , we can argue that the discrete systems are more fundamental ones since they contain continuous ones as special limits .",
    "studying the stroboscopic map of any time - periodic system is always possible , at least numerically . to get",
    "an analytical expression a much studied form of the time dependence is : @xmath26 .",
    "the standard map and its quantization as well as an experimental realization of the time - dependence through a periodically pulsed laser field @xcite provides a well known example of this kind .",
    "the map corresponding to the tdho is a linear map , which is very simple classically .    here",
    "we will study the map corresponding to the nonlinear system .",
    "the hamiltonian of interest is , @xmath27 and the corresponding hamilton s equations of motion are , @xmath28 the equation of motion of the system is given by , @xmath29 this equation is the same as that of the subsidiary condition given in eq .",
    "( [ coef ] ) , except for the constant @xmath30 .",
    "integrating hamilton s equations of motion from just after the @xmath31-th kick to just after the @xmath32-th kick and defining new scaled variables @xmath33 the phase space map of the system is , @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "note that the scaling has removed the @xmath30 dependence , but that the scaling is singular at @xmath36 and in fact this limit leads to the removal of the @xmath37 term , as is discussed further below .",
    "if we plot this phase space map numerically , it clearly shows its regular behaviour , as illustrated in fig .",
    "this rather complicated looking discrete map has a very simple behaviour , reflecting the fact that both this and a linear map , derivable from a tdho , have common algebraic antecedents .",
    "this linear map is derived from the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ ham6 ] ) by simply discarding the @xmath37 term ( the @xmath36 limit ) and is given by @xmath38 in fact the property of the linear map that exclusively quasi - periodic or entirely periodic behaviour exists for different values of the parameter is also observed for the nonlinear map .",
    "for @xmath39 the motion is bounded and stable and for all other values the motion is unbounded and unstable , in both the maps .",
    "the invariant in the case of the linear map describes either an ellipse or a hyperbola , now we determine the invariant of the nonlinear map using the method of lr .",
    "( [ inv4 ] ) the invariant of this map would be of the form , @xmath40 where @xmath18 satisfies the same subsidiary condition as given in eq .",
    "( [ coef ] ) , but now @xmath41 .",
    "if we are able to determine any particular solution of the subsidiary condition , then we can use that solution to get the invariant of the map eq .",
    "( [ map ] ) . as we have already mentioned , the equation of motion of this nonlinear kicked system is the same as that of the subsidiary condition for @xmath18 , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ same ] ) , therefore if we are able to get _ any _ solution of the nonlinear map eq .",
    "( [ map ] ) , that solution should also be the solution for @xmath18 .",
    "the most simple solution corresponds to the fixed - point .",
    "therefore the problem of determining the invariant has been reduced to determining the fixed - point of the nonlinear mapping .",
    "the fixed point is at , @xmath42^{1/4 } } , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "p^{\\ast } & = & \\frac{\\omega^{3/2}}{\\left [ 4 \\left ( 4 \\,-\\ , \\omega^2 \\right ) \\right]^ { 1/4}}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is a particular solution of @xmath18 and @xmath43 .",
    "note that unlike the linear map whose fixed point at the origin is independent of the system parameters , the fixed points here move with the parameter and as the system approaches instability ( @xmath44 ) , they approach infinity . using these solutions , we get the invariant of the mapping within an arbitrary multiplicative constant as , @xmath45 the lack of a time subscript on @xmath46 indicates its constancy .",
    "this invariant is valid even when the motion is classically unstable .",
    "we would like to study the nonlinear map from a point of view that simultaneously explains its dynamics as well as sets the stage for quantum mechanical work . here",
    "we introduce the classical time - evolution operator for studying the dynamics of the system . for a given dynamical variable ,",
    "say @xmath47 , the corresponding liouville operator is denoted by @xmath48 and it is defined as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 denotes the usual poisson bracket .",

    "to understand the dynamics for time @xmath31 , we have to determine the power @xmath74 .",
    "the one parameter abelian group of the powers completely specifies the dynamics at all time .",

    ". we can write @xmath75 in a single exponential form , following an earlier work of truax @xcite , but that form is so involved that it becomes difficult to extract the essentially simple dynamics of the system .",
    "we apply a recent operator method , referred to earlier @xcite , to derive the classical time - evolution operator at any time .",
    "the general procedure of this method is simple to describe . if we have any general time - dependent hamiltonian of the form given by , @xmath76 where @xmath77 are a set of linearly independent general complex function of time and the dynamical variables @xmath78 are the generators of any @xmath79dimensional closed lie algebra .",

    "( [ clco ] ) .",
    "therefore we would get an identical map for the quantum coefficients as for the classical coefficients eq .",
    "( [ xyz ] ) .",
    "since these two maps are identical , their stability properties are identical , i.e. , quantum dynamics exactly follows its classical counterpart .",
    "thus when the classical perron - frobenius operator becomes identity as in eq .",
    "( [ ident ] ) the flouquet operator also becomes identity .",
    "the various cases discussed classically , including the marginal and the reflective hyperbolic cases have exact quantum counterparts . thus as far as time evolution is concerned the quantal problem is already solved .",
    "issues of eigenstates and spectrum can be tackled similarly , as for example done in @xcite for the case of the kicked harmonic oscillator ; however we do not pursue this further here .",
    "we have studied , both classically and quantum mechanically , a time - dependent one - dimensional nonlinear integrable system , namely the kicked harmonic oscillator with a singular potential . by applying our lie - algebraic interpretation of the lr - invariant",
    ", we have determined the exact invariant of that nonlinear system .",
    "one can apply this method to determine the invariant of any time - dependent hamiltonian , formed by the generators of any closed algebra .",
    "we have also found , as far as we know , a new integrable nonlinear mapping .",
    "here we derived that map from the hamiltonian formed of the generators of the @xmath0 algebra .",
    "we expect that we can determine integrable two - dimensional mappings from the hamiltonians formed by the generators of other closed algebras .",
    "we constructed the classical time - evolution operator , or the perron - frobenius operator for the nonlinear integrable system , taking advantage of a recent method of solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "this brings into relief the extreme quantum - classical correspondence in these systems which have algebraic structures underlying them .",
    "we may speculate whether for time - dependent systems with more than one degree of freedom , which are constructed from elements of some lie algebra , the nonlinear equations ( whether difference or differential ) that are the analogue of the coefficient mapping in eq .",
    "( [ xyz ] ) are integrable .",
    "further , if there is a connection between the integrability of these equations and that of the original system itself .",
    "our study that began as an attempt to study a nonlinear time - dependent integrable system led us to one that is in many respects related to the harmonic oscillator with time - dependent frequency .",
    "we may then ask if we can go beyond this limitation to a more `` genuine '' form of nonlinearity ."
