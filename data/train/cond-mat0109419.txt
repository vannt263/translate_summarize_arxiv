    "the theory of quantum phase transitions has emerged in the last decade as a powerful tool for the description of the unconventional electronic properties of a variety of correlated systems .",
    "this article will provide an elementary overview of some theoretical models of quantum phase transitions in two spatial dimensions , along with a brief discussion of their experimental applications .",
    "one reason for our focus on two dimensions is , of course , our interest in the properties of the cuprate superconductors , whose interesting electronic excitations reside within a cuo@xmath5 square lattice .",
    "however , not coincidentally , two is also the spatial dimension in which many of the most natural class of non - trivial quantum critical points reside ; three is the `` upper - critical dimension '' of many critical points , at and above which the physical properties are adequately described by a mean field theory ( possibly extended with some low order fluctuation corrections ) .",
    "this article is addressed to newcomers to the study of quantum phase transitions who desire an introduction to some of the experimentally relevant theoretical questions under current discussion .",
    "we will assume the reader is well - versed in the standard theory of classical critical phenomena , and so our focus will be on novel aspects of quantum phase transitions , including the role of quantum berry phases and of excitations with fermionic statistics .",
    "earlier reviews by this author  @xcite provide detailed discussions of background material which we will occasionally refer the reader to ; most of our discussion here goes beyond these reviews , and focuses on current theoretical and experimental developments .",
    "we begin in section  [ ladders ] by describing the magnetic quantum transition in the coupled ladder antiferromagnet .",
    "high precision numerical studies of the critical properties of this transition are now available , and these serve as a useful check on the theoretical models .",
    "we map the critical fluctuations of the magnetic nel order on to the o(3 ) @xmath1 field theory in 2 + 1 dimensions , along with additional berry phase terms which reflect the commutation relations of the individual quantum spins .",
    "we illustrate the role of the berry phases by first considering a one - dimensional antiferromagnet in section  [ xy ] , where the results can be compared with those obtained by bosonization methods .",
    "we return to our discussion of two - dimensional quantum spin models in section  [ 2d ] , where we extend the methods developed in section  [ xy ] : we demonstrate that the berry phases induce bond - centered charge order in the paramagnetic phase of antiferomagnets with full square lattice symmetry , while they can be safely neglected in the coupled ladder antiferromagnet .",
    "the remaining sections extend these theories to doped antiferromagnets with mobile charge carriers .",
    "section  [ magd ] considers magnetic transitions in superconductors , while section  [ did ] describes transitions between bcs superconductors with differing pair wavefunctions .",
    "we will begin our discussion by describing the quantum phase transition in a simple two - dimensional model of antiferromagnetically coupled @xmath6 heisenberg spins . at the microscopic level",
    ", this model does not describe the spin fluctuations in the cuprate superconductors .",
    "however , a fairly subtle argument , which we develop in the following sections and culminate in section  [ magd ] , shows that the universal properties of the simple critical point described in this section are identical to those of a magnetic ordering transition in the cuprate superconductors .",
    "the model presented here also provides a useful description of other transition metal oxides with a spin gap  @xcite .",
    "we consider the `` ladder '' hamiltonian @xmath7 where @xmath8 are spin-1/2 operators on the sites of the coupled - ladder lattice shown in fig  [ fig1 ] , with the @xmath9 links forming decoupled two - leg ladders while the @xmath10 links couple the ladders as shown .    )",
    "are placed on the sites , the @xmath9 links are shown as full lines , and the @xmath10 links as dashed lines.,width=288 ]    the ground state of @xmath11 depends only on the dimensionless coupling @xmath12 , and we will describe the low temperature properties as a function of @xmath12 .",
    "we will restrict our attention to @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we will begin with a physical discussion of the phases and excitations of the coupled ladder antiferromagnet , @xmath15 in section  [ sec : lad1 ] .",
    "we will propose a quantum field - theoretical description of this model in section  [ sec : lad2 ] : we will verify that the limiting regimes of the field theory contain excitations whose quantum numbers are in accord with the phases discussed in section  [ sec : lad1 ] , and will then use the field theory to describe the critical point .",
    "let us first consider the case where @xmath12 is close to 1 .",
    "exactly at @xmath16 , @xmath11 is identical to the square lattice heisenberg antiferromagnet , and this is known to have long - range , magnetic nel order in its ground state _",
    "i.e. _ the spin - rotation symmetry is broken and the spins have a non - zero , staggered , expectation value in the ground state with @xmath17 where @xmath18 is some fixed unit vector in spin space , and @xmath19 is @xmath20 on the two sublattices .",
    "this long - range order is expected to be preserved for a finite range of @xmath12 close to 1 .",
    "the low - lying excitations above the ground state consist of slow spatial deformations in the orientation @xmath18 : these are the familiar spin waves , and they can carry arbitrarily low energy _",
    "i.e. _ the phase is ` gapless ' .",
    "there are _ two _ polarizations of spin waves at each wavevector @xmath21 ( measured from the antiferromagnetic ordering wavevector ) , and they have excitation energy @xmath22 , with @xmath23 the spin - wave velocities in the two spatial directions .",
    "let us turn now to the vicinity of @xmath24 .",
    "exactly at @xmath25 , @xmath11 is the hamiltonian of a set of decoupled spin ladders .",
    "such spin ladders are known to have a paramagnetic ground state , with spin rotation symmetry preserved , and an energy gap to all excitations  @xcite . a caricature of the ground state is sketched in fig  [ fig2 ] : spins on opposite rungs of the ladder pair in valence bond singlets in a manner which preserves all lattice symmetries .    .",
    "the ovals represent singlet valence bond pairs . ,",
    "width=336 ]    excitations are now formed by breaking a valence bond , which leads to a _",
    "three_-fold degenerate state with total spin @xmath0 , as shown in fig  [ fig3 ] ; this broken bond can hop from site - to - site , leading to a triplet quasiparticle excitation .",
    "exciton of the paramagnet .",
    "( b ) fission of the @xmath0 excitation into two @xmath6 spinons .",
    "the spinons are connected by a `` string '' of valence bonds ( denoted by dashed ovals ) which are not able to resonate with their environment , and some of which lie on weaker bonds ; this string costs a finite energy per unit length and leads to the confinement of spinons.,width=528 ]    note that this quasiparticle is _ not _ a spin - wave ( or equivalently , a ` magnon ' ) but is more properly referred to as a spin 1 _ exciton_. for @xmath12 small , but not exactly 0 , we expect that the ground state will remain a gapped paramagnet , and the spin exciton will now move in two dimensions .",
    "we parameterize its energy at small wavevectors by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the spin gap , and @xmath28 , @xmath29 are velocities .",
    "fig  [ fig3 ] also presents a simple argument which shows that the @xmath0 exciton can not fission into two @xmath6 ` spinons ' .",
    "the very distinct symmetry signatures of the ground states and excitations between @xmath30 and @xmath31 make it clear that the two limits can not be continuously connected .",
    "it is known  @xcite that there is an intermediate second - order phase transition at @xmath32 .",
    "both the spin gap @xmath27 and the nel order parameter @xmath33 vanish continuously as @xmath34 is approached from either side .      a convenient field - theoretic description of the two phases introduced in section  [ sec : lad1 ] , and of the critical point which separates them ,",
    "is obtained by the coherent state path integral .",
    "a detailed derivation of this approach has been provided by the author in chapter 13 of ref .",
    "@xcite which the reader should now consult ; we will only highlight a few important points here .",
    "the coherent state path integral is best introduced by considering first a single spin @xmath35 with angular momentum @xmath36 and hamiltonian @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a static magnetic field .",
    "the @xmath39 eigenvalues of @xmath40 are , of course , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 , and so we also know its partition function @xmath43 at a temperature @xmath44 .",
    "the coherent state path integral represents @xmath43 in terms of an integral over all possible closed curves , @xmath45 , on the surface of a unit sphere , each curve representing a possible history of the precessing spin in imaginary time , @xmath46 : @xmath47 the first term is the so - called ` berry phase ' , and @xmath48 is defined to be the oriented area of the spherical triangle defined by @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and an arbitrary reference point @xmath51 ( which is usually chosen to be the north pole ) .",
    "we will see that @xmath52 behaves in many respects like the time - component of a gauge field , and this accounts for the suggestive notation .",
    "all physical results should be independent of the choice of @xmath51 , and it is easy to see that changes in @xmath51 amount to gauge transformations of @xmath52 .",
    "so if we change @xmath51 to @xmath53 , then the resulting @xmath54 is related to @xmath52 by @xmath55 where @xmath56 measures the oriented area of the spherical triangle defined by @xmath57 , @xmath51 , and @xmath53 .",
    "we now apply the above path integral independently to every site of the coupled ladder antiferromagnet : we obtain a path integral over fields @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is a site index as in ( [ ham ] ) . as discussed in chapter 13 of ref .",
    "@xcite , it is convenient to now take a spatial continuum limit , to allow focus on the important low energy excitations .",
    "this proceeds by the parameterization @xmath60 where @xmath61 on the two subattices , @xmath62 is the lattice spacing , @xmath63 , @xmath64 is a unit length continuum field representing the staggered nel order parameter , and @xmath65 is the continuum field for the conserved , uniform , magnetization density ( the normalization chosen in ( [ cont ] ) is that required to make @xmath66 exactly equal to the total spin ) .",
    "next , a gradient expansion in performed on the effective action for @xmath15 , and after integrating out the @xmath67 fluctuations we obtain the following path integral for the partition function of the coupled ladder antiferromagnet : @xmath68 , \\label{zl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the velocities @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and the coupling constant @xmath71^{1/4}$ ] .",
    "we will now view @xmath72 as the tuning parameter , and values of @xmath72 on either side of a critical value @xmath73 place the system in one of the two phases discussed in section  [ sec : lad1 ] ; notice that @xmath72 is a decreasing function of @xmath12 for @xmath74 , and so the `` strong '' coupling phase @xmath75 corresponds to the spin gap phase with @xmath76 , while @xmath77 is the @xmath78 nel phase .",
    "the first term in ( [ zl ] ) is a residual berry phase , and this remains expressed on the underlying lattice : there is no natural way to take its continuum limit .",
    "notice that this term induces complex weights in the partition function and so it has no analog in the theory of classical phase transitions .",
    "this berry phase plays a central role in determining the phases and critical points of many quantum spin systems , and describing its consequences is one of the central purposes of this article .",
    "however , our discussions in the following sections will show that at least for the case of the coupled ladder antiferromagnet the berry phase in ( [ zl ] ) can be safely neglected , and so we will drop it in the remainder of this subsection .    upon omission of the berry phase in ( [ zl ] )",
    ", @xmath79 becomes a standard path integral , familiar in well established theories of classical phase transitions in @xmath80 dimensions .",
    "for instance , after interpreting @xmath46 as a third dimension ( _ i.e. _ @xmath81 ) , and @xmath18 as the local magnetization in a three - dimensional ferromagnet ( _ e.g. _ iron ) , then @xmath79 is simply its _ classical _ partition function at a finite ` temperature ' @xmath82 , with the coupling constant @xmath83 .",
    "from the theory of such ferromagnets it is known that a convenient description of the physical properties of @xmath79 emerges not in a formulation in terms of the fixed length field @xmath18 ( the ` hard spin ' representation ) , but in a formulation using a ` soft spin ' field @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) with no length constraint .",
    "we connect the two formulations by a coarse - graining transformation , so that @xmath86 represents the average of @xmath18 over some small coarse - graining volume of spacetime .",
    "the new form of @xmath79 is now @xmath87 , \\label{zl1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where keep in mind that the berry phase in ( [ zl ] ) has been dropped , @xmath88 is now the new tuning parameter ( replacing @xmath72 in ( [ zl ] ) ) , and the quartic interaction @xmath89 has replaced the fixed length constraint in ( [ zl ] ) .",
    "the two phases of section  [ sec : lad1 ] are now separated by a critical value @xmath90 , with the @xmath76 spin gap phase corresponding to @xmath91 , while the @xmath92 nel phase appears for @xmath93 .",
    "the well - known properties of the model ( [ zl1 ] ) , when translated into the quantum framework of interest here , are easily seen to reproduce the physical properties of the phases discussed in section  [ sec : lad1 ] .    for @xmath94 ,",
    "@xmath79 in ( [ zl1 ] ) has a `` ferromagnetic '' phase associated with the breaking of spin rotation invariance , and the development of the expectation value @xmath95 ; to lowest order in @xmath89 , the spontaneous magnetization is @xmath96 and is determined by the minimum of the `` mexican hat '' potential for the @xmath86 field . after using ( [ cont ] ) this `` ferromagnetic '' order in the classical model",
    "is seen to correspond to the antiferromagnetic nel order ( [ neel ] ) in the quantum model .",
    "a standard gaussian fluctuation analysis about this ordered states shows that susceptiblity transverse to the spontaneous moment is given by @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a frequency associated with imaginary time .",
    "after analytically continuing to real frequencies , @xmath99 , this yields the quantum response function to an applied staggered field transverse to the nel order : @xmath100 this response function has a pole , representing the two spin - wave excitations , at energy @xmath101 .",
    "this is in complete accord with our discussion of the properties of the nel phase in section  [ sec : lad1 ] .    for @xmath102",
    ", the `` disordered '' phase of @xmath79 in ( [ zl1 ] ) corresponds to the quantum paramagnet with a spin gap . here , a computation of the susceptibility to lowest order in @xmath89 yields @xmath103 where we have already analytically continued to real frequencies , @xmath104 , and ( for now ) the residue @xmath105 .",
    "this response function is independent of the direction of the applied staggered field , and so its pole represents the @xmath0 exciton at energy @xmath106 .",
    "this is again in accord with the discussion of the spin gap phase in section  [ sec : lad1 ] : the exciton dispersion ( [ epart ] ) is obtained from the present result in a small momentum expansion .",
    "the pole structure in ( [ e3 ] ) actually holds to all orders in an expansion in @xmath89  @xcite : at quantum temperature @xmath107 , such corrections renormalize the values of the spin gap @xmath27 and the quasiparticle residue @xmath108 , and induce additional spectral weight associated with multiple excitonic continua at energies larger than @xmath109 , but they do not broaden the quasiparticle pole .",
    "physically , this happens because the exciton is the lowest energy excitation with spin @xmath0 , and so conservation of total spin prevents implies that this excitation has an infinite lifetime . only at @xmath110",
    "does a finite lifetime appear , associated with scattering off the thermally excited density of pre - exiting excitons .",
    "the present field theoretical framework can also be extended to obtain a theory for the critical point at @xmath90 ( @xmath111 ) , as has been discussed in some detail in  @xcite . in its application to the classical ferromagnet",
    ", the critical properties of ( [ zl1 ] ) have been understood in some detail in studies of the @xmath1 field theory , and accurate values of the critical exponents have been obtained . in a recent quantum monte carlo study of the coupled ladder antiferromagnet @xmath15 , matsumoto _ et al . _",
    "@xcite determined the critical exponents at @xmath111 to impressive accuracy , and all values are in accord with the exponents of the @xmath1 field theory .",
    "this agreement is independent numerical support for the omission of the berry phases in proceeding from ( [ zl ] ) to ( [ zl1 ] ) ; separate theoretical arguments for the same approximation will emerge in the following sections . as we approach the critical point with @xmath112 ,",
    "the pole structure in ( [ e3 ] ) continues to hold at low frequencies , but the spin gap vanishes as @xmath113 and the residue vanishes as @xmath114 , where @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 are standard critical exponents .",
    "right at @xmath90 there are no quasiparticle excitions , and the dynamic susceptiblity instead displays a branch - cut representing the continuum of critical excitations : @xmath118 for more information on the physics of this critical continuum , refer to  @xcite .",
    "this section will divert from the main subject of this paper by considering some simple examples of quantum phase transitions in one dimension .",
    "our purpose here is to illustrate the consequences of the berry phases in ( [ zl ] ) by considering a simplified model for which they can be evaluated completely ; we will also be able to test our method by comparing the results with those obtained by a bosonization analysis of the same one - dimensional model .",
    "we will then proceed to apply closely related methods in two dimensions in section  [ 2d ] .",
    "we will evaluate the generalization of ( [ zl ] ) in one dimension for case in which the hamiltonian has on a global u(1 ) spin symmetry , and the anisotropies are such that the spins prefer to lie within the @xmath119-@xmath120 plane in spin space . in this case",
    "we can parameterize @xmath18 by a single angle @xmath121 : @xmath122 with these simplifications , we will find that powerful duality methods enable us to obtain considerable insight into the physics a partition function with berry phases and complex weights . with the parameterization ( [ e5 ] ) and",
    "the restriction to one spatial dimension , we expect the resulting @xmath79 to provide a description of a large class of spin @xmath36 quantum antiferromagnets in one dimension ; to be specfic , we expect it will model the hamiltonian @xmath123 where @xmath124 are first / second neighbor antiferromagnetic exchange constants ( @xmath125 is not too large ) , and the anisotropy @xmath126 induces a preference for the spins to reside in the @xmath119-@xmath120 plane .",
    "we can reasonably expect that the phase diagram of @xmath127 as a function of @xmath128 and @xmath129 is similar to that of @xmath79 as a function of @xmath72 .",
    "the former is already known by an earlier bosonization analysis  @xcite and will provide an instructive comparison with the latter .",
    "our computation begins by a transformation of the berry phase in ( [ zl ] ) to an alternative form in one dimension .",
    "we discretize spacetime into a square lattice of sites , @xmath59 , ( @xmath59 is now a spacetime index , unlike the spatial index in ( [ e6 ] ) , and its interpretation should be clear from the context ) . for this spacetime lattice",
    "we define @xmath130 , with @xmath131 , to be the oriented area of the spherical triangle formed by @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and a fixed reference @xmath51 .",
    "then , as illustrated in fig  [ fig4 ] , we can use the identity @xmath134 to relate the berry phase to the @xmath135 flux piercing the plaquettes of the spacetime lattice ;    ) which relates the berry phase to the sum over the @xmath135 flux in every plaquette in the odd columns.,width=288 ]    here @xmath136 is a fixed integer field on the sites , @xmath137 , of the dual lattice , and a convenient choice is @xmath138 _ i.e. _ @xmath136 is unity on every odd column , and zero on every even column .",
    "the symbol @xmath139 represents a discrete lattice derivative , with @xmath140 .",
    "now we use the in - plane form of @xmath18 in ( [ e5 ] ) to our advantage .",
    "the flux @xmath141 through any plaquette is clearly equal to the surface area of the quadrilateral on the unit sphere formed by the @xmath132 on the four vertices of the plaquette . for planar spins ,",
    "such a quadrilateral lies entirely on the equator , and its area is generically zero .",
    "the only exception occurs when a vortex in @xmath121 pierces the plaquette : in this case , the quadrilateral is the entire equator and the flux is the area of a hemisphere @xmath142 .",
    "so we have established that the berry phases in ( [ zl ] ) generate the factor @xmath143 for easy - plane spin systems in one dimension . as the vortex number is always an integer",
    ", we see that the factor in ( [ e8 ] ) is always unity for integer @xmath36 , and the berry phases can be ignored for these values of @xmath36 .",
    "the remaining terms in the action of ( [ zl ] ) can also be simplified for the present situation . on the discrete spacetime lattice , and with ( [ e5 ] ) , these terms become @xmath144 , which is the usual action of a `` classical '' xy model in @xmath145 dimensions . as is standard ,",
    "duality manipulations on this xy model are more conveniently performed in a periodic gaussian , ` villain ' , representation of the weights of the model . in this manner , we finally obtain the generalization of the partition function ( [ zl ] ) to u(1 ) symmetric , quantum spin @xmath36 chains : @xmath146 where @xmath147 are integers on the links of the direct lattice which , when summed , produce the periodic gaussian weights for @xmath148 , the @xmath149 represents a sum over plaquettes , and @xmath150 are the vortex numbers of the plaquettes . the expression ( [ e9 ] ) is amenable to an exact duality transformation which produces a representation in which all weights are positive : we apply the poisson summation identity to the sum over @xmath147 on each link , and replace it by a sum over integers @xmath151 : @xmath152 here , and henceforth , we drop overall normalization constants in front of partition functions . now",
    "the integral over the @xmath153 can be performed independently on each site , and only imposes the constraint @xmath154 .",
    "we solve this constraint by writing @xmath155 , with the @xmath156 integers on the sites of the dual lattice .",
    "so we obtain the exact mapping of ( [ e9 ] ) to  @xcite @xmath157 where the `` heights '' @xmath158 on the sites of the dual lattice are restricted to the values @xmath159 the expression ( [ e10 ] ) is a canonical height ( or ` solid - on - solid ' ) model in two dimensions .",
    "the only influence of the quantum berry phase are the restrictions on the allowed values of the heights of the `` interface '' : for integer @xmath36 the heights take all integer values just as in the standard solid - on - solid model , while for half - integer @xmath36 , the heights are restricted to half - odd - integer ( integer ) values on the odd ( even ) columns of the square lattice .",
    "as we have made a number of approximations in the deriving @xmath160 from the path integral of spin systems , we shall be interested in a generalized class of height models with additional short - range non - local couplings , apart from the simple terms appearing in ( [ e10 ] ) . with these additional couplings ,",
    "standard methods from the theory of interface models can be used to show  @xcite that the generalized height models describe phases not only in the easy - plane , small @xmath161 , limit of ( [ e6 ] ) , but also those in the easy - axis , large @xmath161 limit when the spins prefer to lie in the @xmath162 directions . in all of this analysis",
    "it is essential that we not relax the restrictions on the allowed values of the heights , as these are fundamental consequences of the quantized value of the spin @xmath36 .",
    "we describe the main results for two sets of @xmath36 values in turn .",
    "the standard model with integer heights on every site has two phases . for small @xmath72 ,",
    "the interface is rough ; this is dual to the classical or quantum xy phase with quasi - long - range spin order in the @xmath119-@xmath120 plane , with power - law decay of spin correlations .",
    "for the quantum spin chain , we may refer to this phase as a tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) liquid , as it shares many of the characteristics of other tl liquids .",
    "for large @xmath72 , the interface is smooth ; this is dual to the `` disordered '' phase of the classical xy model . for the quantum spin chain ,",
    "this large @xmath72 phase has exponential decay of spin correlations in imaginary time , and therefore a spin gap .",
    "its characteristics are rather similar to the spin gap phase discussed in section  [ ladders ] : the primary excitation is a gapped @xmath0 exciton with an infinite lifetime at low energies . as the spin anisotropy is reduced by increasing @xmath128 in ( [ e6 ] ) , this spin gap phase connects continuously to the well - known haldane gap state of integer spin chains with su(2 ) symmetry .",
    "the transition between the small and large @xmath72 phases is second - order , and is described by the standard kosterlitz - thouless theory of the classical xy model in two dimensions .",
    "the staggering of the heights between integer and half - odd - integer values introduces crucial differences in the phase diagram , and several new phases are allowed in the generalized phase diagram of such height models .",
    "however , it is believed  @xcite that the specific height model ( [ e10 ] ) , with only a local gradient squared coupling , has only one rough phase for all values of @xmath72 , and this corresponds , as above , to a tl phase of the quantum spin chain .",
    "the other phases appear upon allowing additional short - range couplings in ( [ e10 ] ) , and these can reasonably be expected to arise from terms in the original hamiltonian omitted in the duality mappings ; as we noted above , in this generalization it is essential that we maintain the restrictions on the allowed height values .",
    "the new phases are associated with smooth interfaces , and as in section  [ int ] such phases have a spin gap .",
    "however , the staggering of the heights induces crucial differences in the structure of such spin gap states , as we describe below .",
    "a crucial characteristic of a smooth interface is that there is a well - defined value of the average height @xmath163 in every pure state .",
    "furthermore , for the staggered height models under consideration here , every value of the average @xmath164 _ breaks a lattice translational symmetry of the quantum spin chain_. for instance if @xmath165 ( modulo integers ) then the even columns of the square lattice ( which have integer allowed heights ) have been picked out , and we may expect the average energy , @xmath166 on the links associated with the even columns to be smaller ( say ) than those on the odd columns .",
    "conversely , an interface with @xmath167 ( modulo integers ) reverses the role of the odd and even columns .",
    "the choice between these two sets of average heights corresponds to a spontaneously broken @xmath168 symmetry in the ground state , which now has ` spin - peierls ' or ` bond - centered charge ' ( bc ) order .",
    "the nature of these ordered states , and of their excitations , is illustrated in fig  [ fig5 ] : they have a spin gap , but the lowest - lying excitations are fractionalized @xmath6 spinons which reside on the domain wall between the two bc states .     quantum spin chain .",
    "the ellipses represent valence bonds as in fig  [ fig2 ] , and these have spontaneously chosen one of two possible dimerizations of the chain .",
    "( b ) @xmath6 spin excitations of the bc state . unlike the case in fig  [ fig3]b , these spinons are free to move far apart from each other : this is because we are in one dimension _ and _ the dimerization is spontaneous .",
    "such spinons are confined in two dimensions whether the bc order is spontaneous or explicitly present in the hamiltonian.,width=480 ]    other possible values of @xmath164 in the smooth interface phase lead to other discrete broken symmetries in the quantum spin chain . as we describe in ref .",
    "@xcite , the values @xmath169 ( modulo integers ) correspond to states with ising spin order _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath170 . all other values of @xmath164 correspond to four - fold degenerate states with co - existing ising and bc order .",
    "we sketch the phase diagram of the model ( [ e10 ] ) for @xmath36 half - odd - integer in fig  [ fig6 ] , as obtained by a bosonization analysis  @xcite .",
    "quantum spin chain @xmath127 as obtained by abelian bosonization @xcite .",
    "identical results are obtained from a generalized square lattice height model in which the heights take half - odd - integer ( integer ) values on the even ( odd ) columns.,width=288 ]    the tl , bc , and ising phases are all separated by second - order transition lines , and the three lines meet at a single multi - critical point : all the critical properties can be described by an extension of the kosterlitz - thouless renormalization group flows .",
    "analysis of the generalized height models discussed here leads to a phase diagram with an identical topology and critical properties @xcite .",
    "we are now prepared to describe the evaluation of the 2 + 1 dimensional path integral with berry phases in ( [ zl ] ) . as in the 1 + 1 dimensional case in section  [ xy ]",

    "the heights are integers on one square sublattice , and half - odd - integers on the second sublattice . finally for even integer",
    "@xmath36 the offset has no effect and the height is an integer on all sites .",
    "we discuss these classes of @xmath36 values in turn in the following subsections .",
    "( it is worth emphasizing here that the height model @xmath224 in ( [ he1 ] ) only offers a description of the large @xmath72 paramagnetic phase of the model @xmath179 in ( [ f1 ] ) in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the small @xmath72 nel ordered state is not one of the phases of @xmath224 , nor is the critical point describing the onset of magnetic order ; an extension of @xmath224 to include the nel state was discussed in  @xcite , but will not be presented here .",
    "this should be contrasted with the situation in 1 + 1 dimensions discussed in section  [ xy ] ; there height models like @xmath160 in ( [ e10 ] ) can describe all the phases and critical points of the quantum spin chain , including the tl phase , which is a state with quasi - long - range nel order ) .      unlike the two - dimensional case , three - dimensional height models generically have no roughening transition , and the interface is always smooth . with all heights integers ,",
    "the smooth phase breaks no symmetries .",
    "so like the case of integer @xmath36 in quantum spin chains ( section  [ int ] ) , square lattice antiferromagnets with @xmath36 even integer can have a paramagnetic ground state with a spin gap and no broken symmetries .",
    "this is in accord with the exact ground state for a @xmath225 antiferromagnet on the square lattice found by affleck _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , the aklt state .",
    "the structure of this state is identical to that of the paramagnetic state of the @xmath1 field theory in 2 + 1 dimensions ( eqn ( [ zl1 ] ) with @xmath226 ) , with a stable @xmath0 spin exciton excitation .",
    "so the critical point between the magnetic nel state and the spin gap state should also be described by the @xmath1 field theory . as we noted above , this critical point",
    "is not contained within @xmath224 .",
    "now the heights of the interface model can take four possible values , which are integers plus the offsets on the four square sublattices shown in fig  [ fig8]a . as in section",
    "[ s2 ] , the interface is always smooth , but as in section  [ hint ] , any smooth interface must break a lattice symmetry with the development of bond - centered charge ( bc ) order and this allows a number of distinct spin gap ground states of the lattice antiferromagnet .",
    "consistent with these theoretical predictions , numerical studies of the frustrated spin model ( [ f2 ] ) have produced evidence for bc order in the state contiguous to the nel state : see  @xcite for recent results .",
    "it is useful , first , to obtain a simple physical interpretation of the interface model in the language of the @xmath6 antiferromagnet  @xcite . from fig",
    "[ fig8]a it is clear that nearest neighbor heights can differ either by 1/4 or 3/4 ( modulo integers ) . to minimize the action in ( [ he1 ] ) , we should choose the interface with the largest possible number of steps of @xmath227 .",
    "however , the interface is frustrated , and it is not possible to make all steps @xmath227 and at least a quarter of the steps must be @xmath228 . indeed , there is a precise one - to - one mapping between interfaces with the minimal number of @xmath228 steps ( we regard interfaces differing by a uniform integer shift in all heights as equivalent ) and the dimer coverings of the square lattice : the proof of this claim is illustrated in fig  [ fig9 ] .     in ( [ he1 ] ) .",
    "each dimer on the direct lattice is associated with a step in height of @xmath228 on the link of the dual lattice that crosses it .",
    "all other height steps are @xmath229 .",
    "each dimer represents a singlet valence between the sites , as in fig  [ fig2].,width=220 ]    we identify each dimer with a singlet valence bond between the spins ( the ellipses in fig  [ fig2 ] ) , and so each interface corresponds to a quantum state with each spin locked in the a singlet valence bond with a particular nearest neighbor .",
    "fluctuations of the interface in imaginary time between such configurations correspond to quantum tunneling events between such dimer states , and an effective hamiltonian for this is provided by the quantum dimer model  @xcite .",
    "the nature of the possible smooth phases of the interface model are easy to determine from the above picture , and by standard techniques from statistical theory which have been reviewed elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "interfaces with average height @xmath230 ( modulo integers ) correspond to the four - fold degenerate bc ordered states in fig  [ fig10]a , while those with @xmath231 ( modulo integers ) correspond to the four - fold degenerate plaquette bc states in fig  [ fig10]b .     on the square lattice : ( a ) the columnar spin - peierls states , and ( b ) plaquette state .",
    "the different values of the @xmath232 on the links are encoded by the different line styles .",
    "both states are 4-fold degenerate ; an 8-fold degenerate state , with superposition of the above orders , also appears as a possible ground state of the generalized interface model.,width=259 ]    all other values of @xmath164 are associated with eight - fold degenerate bc states with a superposition of the orders in fig  [ fig10]a and b.    it is interesting to note here that the symmetry of the state in fig  [ fig10]a is identical to the symmetry of the coupled ladder hamiltonian illustrated in fig  [ fig1 ] : so the system has spontaneously decided to arrange itself in the form of a coupled ladder . whether the bc ordering is spontaneous ( as it is here ) or explicitly present in the hamiltonian ( as in section  [ ladders ] ) , the nature of the non - zero spin excitations should be the same .",
    "so the confinement argument of fig  [ fig3]b applies here too , and there are no free @xmath6 spinons in the bc state . the elementary excitation is a @xmath0 spin exciton .",
    "this should be contrasted with the @xmath6 quantum spin chain in section  [ hint ] , where the bc state had spinon excitations .",
    "we are now finally in a position to explain a central step in the analysis of section  [ ladders ] : the neglect of berry phases in the theory of the magnetic critical point for the coupled ladder antiferromagnet .",
    "we have seen here that the primary effect of the berry phases is to induce bc order in the spin gap state . however , such `` order '' is already present explicitly in the hamiltonian of the coupled ladder antiferromagnet , which has two sites per unit cell : the hamiltonian picks out one of the four bc states and `` dimer '' fluctuations to the other bc states are suppressed .",
    "so we need only focus on the fluctuations of the magnetic order , and these are captured by the @xmath1 field theory .",
    "the nature of the crossover between the nel and bc states for @xmath6 quantum spin models with the full square lattice symmetry ( like @xmath11 in ( [ f2 ] ) ) is far more subtle , and was recently discussed at some length in ref  @xcite . here , both the nel and bc orders can become critical , and so we can not naively assert the irrelevance of the berry phases .",
    "one appealing scenario  @xcite , supported by recent numerical studies  @xcite , is that the crossover occurs via two transitions : with increasing @xmath72 , there is first a transition at @xmath233 to a state with co - existing nel and bc order ( only the bc fluctuations are critical at @xmath234 are these are described by a @xmath235 clock model ) , and then a transition at @xmath236 where nel order disappears .",
    "the second transition at @xmath237 is just as in the coupled ladder antiferromagnet , and is therefore described by the @xmath1 field theory : there is well - formed bc order on the either side of @xmath238 , and it is immaterial here whether this order was explicitly present in the hamiltonian or spontaneously induced . indeed , this was secretly the reason we chose to consider the coupled ladder antiferromagnet in our early discussion .",
    "this case is similar to that @xmath36 half - odd - integer , and we will not consider it in detail .",
    "the berry phases again induce bc order in the spin gap state , but this order need only lead to a two - fold degeneracy .",
    "we have so far considered a variety of magnetic transitions in correlated `` mott '' insulators , which have an electron density commensurate with the number of available orbitals .",
    "cuprate high temperature superconductivity appears when such a mott insulator on the square lattice is doped by a finite density of mobile carriers .",
    "all of the available experimental evidence supports the proposal that , apart from some inhomogeneous charge ordered insulating states , the ground state of the doped mott insulator is a superconductor . in particular , there is no clear - cut evidence for a metallic fermi liquid state up to a moderate density of holes .",
    "consequently , we will focus our attention on the superconducting ground state in the remainder of this paper .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the approach of  @xcite which examines transitions in metallic states at non - zero temperature .",
    "it is now natural to study the interplay of the nel magnetic order found in the insulator and the superconducting order of the doped system .",
    "( the charge order discussed in section  [ 2d ] also plays an important role in the superconductor , but we will not focus attention on this aspect here  see  @xcite for a recent review . )",
    "the experimental evidence indicates that this crossover proceeds via an intermediate state with _ co - existence _ of magnetic and superconducting order .",
    "furthermore , the magnetic order is no longer in the simple two - sublattice nel configuration , but oscillates at a wavevector @xmath239 .",
    "so instead of expressing the electron spin as @xmath240 , which is implied by ( [ cont ] ) and the subsequent coarse - graining of @xmath18 to @xmath86 , we now write @xmath241 where @xmath242 a 3-component , _ complex _ quantum field ; @xmath243 is required to be complex as along as the magnetic state does not have a two sublattice structure , which is only the case for ordering wavevectors @xmath244 and @xmath245 .",
    "also , the experimental evidence also indicates that the magnetic order is _ collinear _ , and not spiral ; this is the case if @xmath246 .    with this reasoning ,",
    "we are led to consider the quantum transition between a superconducting state with co - existing magnetic spin - density - wave order at wavevector @xmath247 ( @xmath248 in the sc+sdw state ) to an ordinary superconductor ( @xmath249 in the sc state ) .",
    "clearly , the field @xmath243 should be a degree of freedom in any theory for this transition .",
    "however , in a superconductor there are additional fermionic excitations which carry spin @xmath6 , the bogoliubov quasiparticles , and we have to examine their influence on the critical properties .",
    "this is especially the case in a @xmath2-wave superconductor , in which the energy of the quasiparticles vanishes at four ` nodal ' points in the brillouin zone .    to address this issue ,",
    "let us review the standard bcs mean - field theory for a @xmath2-wave superconductor on the square lattice .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian @xmath250 where @xmath251 is the annihilation operator for an electron on site @xmath59 with spin @xmath252 , @xmath253 is its fourier transform to momentum space , @xmath254 is the dispersion of the electrons ( it is conventional to choose @xmath255 , with @xmath256 the first / second neighbor hopping and @xmath172 the chemical potential ) , and the @xmath173 term is the same as that in ( [ f2 ] ) with @xmath257 and @xmath258 the pauli matrices .",
    "we will consider the consequences of the @xmath125 term in ( [ f2 ] ) for the superconductor in section  [ did ] below . applying the bcs mean - field decoupling to @xmath259",
    "we obtain the bogoliubov hamiltonian @xmath260 for a wide range of parameters , the ground state energy optimized by a @xmath3 wavefunction for the cooper pairs : this corresponds to the choice @xmath261 .",

    "we are especially interested in the low energy quasiparticles in the vicinity of these points , and so we perform a gradient expansion of @xmath268 near each of them .",
    "we label the points @xmath269 , @xmath270 , @xmath271 , @xmath272 and write @xmath273 while assuming the @xmath274 are slowly varying functions of @xmath119 .",
    "we also introduce the bispinors @xmath275 , and @xmath276 , and then express @xmath268 in terms of @xmath277 while performing a spatial gradient expansion .",
    "this yields the following effective action for the fermionic quasiparticles : @xmath278 , \\label{g6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have rotated our spatial co - ordinate system by @xmath279 , and the @xmath280 are @xmath281 matrices which are block diagonal , the blocks consisting of @xmath282 pauli matrices .",
    "the velocities @xmath283 are given by the conical structure of @xmath265 near the @xmath284 : we have @xmath285 and latexmath:[$v_{\\delta } =     we are now in a position to discuss the quantum field theory of the transition from the sc+sdw to the sc state in term of the @xmath243 and @xmath277 degrees of freedom .",
    "first , we can write down an action for @xmath243 along the lines of that for @xmath86 in the insulator : this will have a structure very similar to that of ( [ zl1 ] ) ( the complex nature of @xmath243 induces additional quartic terms which we will not discuss here  the reader is referred to another review by the author  @xcite for details on this point ) .",
    "the action will also contain the terms in @xmath287 in ( [ g6 ] ) , and it remains to discuss terms which may couple the @xmath243 and @xmath277 .",
    "the simplest possible terms are cubic interaction terms like @xmath288 etc .",
    "however by comparing the momentum dependencies in ( [ g1 ] ) and ( [ g5a ] ) with ( [ g2a ] ) it is easy to see that such terms will survive after averaging over space only if the special commensurability conditions @xmath289 , or @xmath290 , are satisfied . in general",
    "this will not be the case , and experimental evidence also does not support this possibility .",
    "therefore , we will assume in the remainder of this section that these commensurability conditions are not satisfied : the theory for the case @xmath291 , @xmath292 was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , and has some formal similarities to the theory to be considered in section  [ did ] in a different physical context .    in the absence of special commensurability conditions , the simplest term which can couple the @xmath243 and @xmath277 is @xmath293 however a simple scaling argument shows that the coupling @xmath294 is irrelevant at the sc+sdw to sc critical point . to see this ,",
    "imagine that the critical point is described by the @xmath295 point , where the @xmath243 and @xmath277 fields are decoupled .",
    "this point is actually a fixed point of the renormalization group and is invariant under scaling transformations . from ( [ g6 ] )",
    "we see that the scaling dimensions of @xmath277 is 1 , while that of @xmath296 is @xmath297 , where @xmath116 is the correlation length exponent .",
    "so from ( [ g7 ] ) we conclude that the scaling dimension of @xmath294 is @xmath298 .",
    "the exponent @xmath116 is determined by a theory like that in ( [ zl1 ] ) for @xmath299 and all such theories have @xmath300 , the mean - field exponent .",
    "consequently the scaling dimension of @xmath294 is negative , and the decoupled @xmath295 fixed point describes the sc+sdw to sc quantum phase transition .",
    "the critical magnetic fluctuations are associated with @xmath243 , and the fermionic , @xmath6 quasiparticles @xmath277 are merely innocent spectators .",
    "this last result is quite powerful , as it implies that we can apply the results of the quantum transition in the insulator , discussed in section  [ ladders ] , essentially unchanged to the magnetic fluctuations in the cuprate high temperature superconductors .",
    "such a proposal was first made in ref .",
    "@xcite , and leads to the prediction that the @xmath0 exciton should survive as a stable excitation in the sc state near its transition to the sc+sdw state , and that this should be evident as a sharp `` resonance '' in dynamic neutron scattering : such a resonance appears to have been observed in a number of experiments  @xcite .",
    "the framework of the sc+sdw to sc transition has also been used to understand dynamic spin correlations in the presence of zn impurities  @xcite , and to explore the phase diagram in the presence of an applied magnetic field  @xcite : the results have been quantitatively compared with neutron scattering  @xcite and scanning tunnelling microscopy experiments  @xcite .",
    "in this final section , we will consider one of the simplest examples of a non - trivial quantum critical point in two spatial dimensions which , surprisingly , was only discovered recently  @xcite .",
    "the two phases on either side of the critical point are described by an entirely conventional bcs theory : they differ only in the symmetry of the cooper pair wavefunction , dependent upon the relative co - ordinates of the paired electrons . at @xmath107 ,",
    "bcs theory provides an accurate description of the low energy properties everywhere except at the point which separates the two phases : this is probably the only known example of the failure of bcs theory in two ( or higher ) dimensions in a superconducting ground state . at @xmath110 ,",
    "this failure broadens into the `` quantum critical '' region which should be easily experimentally detectable : we will not discuss these @xmath110 issues here , and instead refer the reader to other reviews  @xcite .",
    "our original motivation for examining transitions between bcs superconductors was provided by photoemission experiments  @xcite which observed an anomalous broadening of the quasiparticle spectrum .",
    "we will discuss this further in section  [ expts ] , but will motivate the problem now on theoretical grounds .",
    "the hubbard model on a square lattice is believed to provide a good starting point for studying the physics of the cuprate superconductors .",
    "there is now good evidence that for electron densities close to half - filling , the primary instability of the fermi liquid state is to a bcs superconductor with @xmath3 symmetry  @xcite , whose mean - field theory was presented in section  [ magd ] . the opposite limit of a low density of electrons , well away from half - filling , has also been examined theoretically  @xcite , and the low density expansion permits reliable predictions to be made : it was found that the ground state was again a bcs superconductor , but now the pairs had a distinct @xmath301 symmetry ( in the presence of a square lattice , the @xmath3 and @xmath301 states are not degenerate , as they would be in free space ) . here",
    "we will answer the simple question : how does the ground state evolve from between these limits with qualitatively different wavefunctions ?    rather than working the full complexities of the hubbard model , we follow the strategy of section  [ magd ] and work with the simplest phenomenological model that contains the two phases we are interested in .",
    "we want to extend @xmath259 in ( [ g2 ] ) so that a bcs mean - field theory will permit a region with @xmath301 superconductivity . clearly this will be possible if we have a pairing interaction along the @xmath302 directions of the square lattice ; so we extend @xmath259 to allow for a second - neighbor exchange along the diagonals , @xmath125 , as in ( [ f2 ] ) : @xmath303 we will follow the evolution of the ground state of @xmath304 as a function of @xmath305 .",
    "we expect that the universal properties of this route will be similar to that of the hubbard model as a function of carrier concentration , in light of the studies of the latter model quoted above .",
    "we begin with a standard bcs analysis of @xmath304 which closely parallels that presented in section  [ magd ] .",
    "the mean - field hamiltonian is now modified from ( [ g3 ] ) to @xmath306 where the second summation over @xmath116 is along the diagonal neighbors @xmath307 and @xmath308 . to obtain @xmath301 pairing along the diagonals , we choose @xmath309 .",

    "it is a simple matter to numerically carry out the minimization of ( [ g11 ] ) , and the results for a typical choice of parameters are shown in fig  [ fig12 ] as a function @xmath129 .     in ( [ g8 ] ) . shown",

    "the relative phase of the pairing amplitudes was always found to obey ( [ g12 ] ) .",
    "the dashed lines denote locations of phase transitions between @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath301 superconductors .",
    "the pairing amplitudes vanish linearly at the two critical points , corresponding to the exponent @xmath320 in ( [ g14 ] ) ; the slight rounding at the end points apparent in the figure is a consequence of the finite step - size used in numerical evaluation of the integral in ( [ g10 ] ) . combining these results with those of  @xcite we propose that the more realistic hubbard model will show the same sequence of phases as those above as a function of increasing doping .",
    "dagan and deutscher  @xcite were the first to propose that @xmath4 superconductivity occurs at a doping larger than @xmath3 superconductivity on the basis of experiments we will discuss in section  [ expts].,width=432 ]    one of the two amplitudes @xmath262 or @xmath311 is always non - zero and so the ground state is always superconducting .",

    "furthermore , in this regime , their relative phase is found to be pinned to @xmath321 _ i.e. _ @xmath322 the reason for this pinning can be intuitively seen from ( [ g11 ] ) : only for these values of the relative phase does the equation @xmath323 never have a solution .",
    "in other words , the gapless nodal quasiparticles of the @xmath3 superconductor ( and also those of the @xmath301 superconductor ) acquire a finite energy gap when a secondary pairing with relative phase @xmath321 develops . by a level repulsion picture",
    ", we can expect that gapping out the low energy excitations should help lower the energy of the ground state .",
    "the intermediate phase obeying ( [ g12 ] ) is called a @xmath324 superconductor .",
    "the choice of the sign in ( [ g12 ] ) leads to an overall two - fold degeneracy in the choice of the wavefunction for the @xmath325 superconductor .",
    "this choice is related to the breaking of time - reversal symmetry , and implies that the @xmath326 phase is characterized by the non - zero expectation value of a @xmath168 ising order parameter ; the expectation value of this order vanishes in the two phases ( the @xmath3 and @xmath301 superconductors ) on either side of the @xmath4 superconductor . as is conventional",
    ", we will represent the ising order by a real scalar field @xmath327 .",
    "fluctuations of @xmath327 become critical near both of the phase boundaries in fig  [ fig12 ] . as we will explain in section  [ qft ] below ,",
    "the critical theory for @xmath327 fluctuations is _ not _ the usual @xmath328 field theory which describes the ordinary ising transition in three spacetime dimensions .",
    "near the phase boundary from @xmath3 to @xmath329 superconductivity it is clear that we can identify @xmath330 ( in the gauge where @xmath262 is real ) .",
    "we can now expand @xmath331 in ( [ g10 ] ) for small @xmath327 ( with @xmath262 finite ) and find a series with the structure  @xcite @xmath332 where @xmath88 , @xmath333 are coefficients and the ellipses represent regular higher order terms in even powers of @xmath327 ; @xmath88 can have either sign , whereas @xmath333 is always positive .",
    "notice the non - analytic @xmath334 term that appears in the bcs theory  this arises from an infrared singularity in the integral in ( [ g10 ] ) over @xmath265 at the four nodal points of the @xmath3 superconductor , and is a preliminary indication that the transition differs from that in the ordinary ising model .",

    "the present bcs theory yields the exponent @xmath343 ; this differs from the usual mean - field exponent @xmath344 , and this is of course due to the non - analytic @xmath334 term in ( [ g13 ] ) .",

    "the theory for the sc+sdw to sdw transition appears in section  [ magd ] , while that of the transition describing the onset of @xmath4 order appears in section  [ qft ] . the second transition may not be on the physical axis for a given cuprate superconductor , but may be nearby in a generalized parameter space.,width=480 ]    at low , but finite , doping we have the sc+sdw phase which was discussed in section  [ magd ] . here",
    "the presence of the sdw order induces spatial anisotropy between the @xmath119 and @xmath120 axis ( in real space ) , and so the superconductivity is not purely @xmath2-wave , although gapless nodal fermions may be present  @xcite . with increasing @xmath347 we have a transition to a sc phase , where the superconducting order is @xmath3 , and is described by a vanilla bcs theory :",
    "this transition was also discussed in section  [ magd ] .",
    "finally , the results of  @xcite show that the @xmath301 superconductivity at very low electron density : we have used a phenomenological model of this crossover in the present section to argue that this implies that the next phase with increasing doping should be a @xmath345 superconductor . the full critical theory of this transition appears in the following subsection .",
    "in placing the @xmath345 at large doping , we are also following the proposal and experimental results of dagan and deutscher  @xcite which we will discuss further in section  [ expts ] .",
    "we will now present a full theory for the quantum transition between the @xmath3 and @xmath324 superconductors : this will allow us to compute the corrections to the predictions of the bcs theory implied by ( [ g13 ] ) .    we have laid much of the ground work for the required field theory in section  [ magd ] .",
    "in addition to the order parameter @xmath327 , the field theory should also involve the low energy nodal fermions of the @xmath3 superconductor , as described by @xmath287 in ( [ g6 ] ) . for the @xmath327 fluctuations , we write down the usual terms permitted near a phase transition with ising symmetry , and similar to those in ( [ zl1 ] ) : @xmath348 . \\label{g15}\\ ] ] note that , unlike ( [ g13 ] ) , we do not have any non - analytic @xmath334 terms in the action : this is because we have not integrated out the low energy nodal fermions , and the terms in ( [ g15 ] ) are viewed as arising from high energy fermions away from the nodal points .",
    "finally , we need to couple the @xmath327 and @xmath277 excitations .",
    "their coupling is already contained in the last term in ( [ g9 ] ) : expressing this in terms of the @xmath277 fermions using ( [ g5a ] ) we obtain @xmath349 , \\label{g16}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is a coupling constant .",
    "the partition function of the full theory is now @xmath350 where @xmath287 was in ( [ g6 ] ) .",
    "it can now be checked that if we integrate out the @xmath277 fermions for a spacetime independent @xmath327 , we do indeed obtain a @xmath334 term in the effective potential for @xmath327 .",
    "we begin our analysis of @xmath351 in ( [ g17 ] ) by following the procedure discussed below ( [ g7 ] ) .",
    "assume that the transition is described by a fixed point with @xmath25 : then as in section  [ magd ] , the theory for the transition would be the ordinary @xmath328 field theory @xmath352 , and the nodal fermions would again be innocent spectators ( we already know from the presence of the @xmath334 term in ( [ g13 ] ) that this assumption can not be correct , but we wish to see how it is invalidated in a renormalization group analysis ) .",
    "the scaling dimension of @xmath327 at such a fixed point is @xmath353 ( where @xmath354 is the anomalous order parameter exponent at the critical point of the ordinary three dimensional ising model ) , while that of @xmath277 is 1 ( as before ) . consequently scaling dimension of @xmath12",
    "is @xmath355 ( using the known , very small value of @xmath354 ) .",
    "this positive scaling dimension implies that @xmath12 is relevant and the @xmath25 fixed point is unstable .",
    "determining the correct critical behavior now requires a full renormalization group analysis of @xmath351 .",
    "this has been described in some detail in  @xcite , and we will not reproduce the details here .",
    "the main result we need for our purposes is that couplings @xmath12 , @xmath89 , @xmath356 and @xmath357 all reach _ non - zero _ fixed point values which define a critical point in a new universality class .",
    "these fixed point values , and the corresponding critical exponents , can be determined in expansions in either @xmath358  @xcite ( where @xmath2 is the spatial dimensionality ) or @xmath359  @xcite ( where @xmath360 is the number of fermion species ) .",
    "indeed the fixed point has the structure of the so - called higgs - yukawa model which has been studied extensively in the particle physics literature  @xcite in a different physical context : quantum monte carlo simulation of this model also exist  @xcite , and provide probably the most accurate estimate of the exponents .",
    "the implications of the existence of this finite - coupling critical point are similar to those for ( [ zl1 ] ) in ( [ e4 ] ) .",
    "the fermion correlation function @xmath361 obeys @xmath362 at low frequencies for @xmath363 .",
    "away from the critical point in the @xmath3 superconductor with @xmath102 , ( [ g18 ] ) holds with @xmath364 , and this is the bcs result , with sharp quasi - particle poles in the green s function . at the critical point",
    "@xmath90 ( [ g18 ] ) holds with the fixed point values for the velocities ( which satisfy @xmath365 ) and with the anomalous dimension @xmath366  the @xmath358 expansion  @xcite estimate is @xmath367 , and the @xmath359 expansion estimate  @xcite is @xmath368 , with @xmath369 .",
    "this is clearly non - bcs behavior , and the fermionic quasiparticle pole in the spectral function has been replaced by a branch - cut representing the continuum of critical excitations . the corrections to bcs extend also to correlations of the ising order @xmath327 : its expectation value vanishes as ( [ g14 ] ) with the monte carlo estimate @xmath370  @xcite .",
    "the critical point correlators of @xmath327 also obey ( [ e4 ] ) with the exponent @xmath371  @xcite , which is clearly different from the very small value of the exponent @xmath354 at the unstable @xmath25 fixed point .",
    "the value of @xmath372 is related to @xmath117 by the usual scaling law @xmath373 , with @xmath374 the correlation length exponent ( which also differs from the exponent @xmath375 of the ising model ) .",
    "we noted at the beginning of this section that our original motivation for studying the @xmath3 to @xmath326 transition was provided by photoemission experiments of valla _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "in particular these experiments found that the typical quasiparticle energy width was of order @xmath376 .",
    "as we have reviewed elsewhere  @xcite , this is a characteristic property of the @xmath110 quantum critical region of a @xmath107 critical point which obeys strong hyperscaling properties . in particular , it is essential that the critical point be described by an interacting field theory , with the interaction strengths determined by a finite - coupling fixed point of the renormalization group .",
    "this condition is clearly satisfied by @xmath351 : the breakdown of bcs theory at @xmath90 , which leads to ( [ g18 ] ) with @xmath366 at @xmath107 , is directly responsible for quasiparticle lifetimes of order @xmath377 over a finite range of @xmath72 values in the @xmath110 quantum critical region . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was also shown that the fixed point of @xmath351 was also essentially unique in satisfying such requirements : the only other zero momentum order parameter which led to suitable critical point was that between a @xmath3 and a @xmath378 superconductor .",
    "a more direct probe of the @xmath345 order has been provided by very interesting tunneling measurements of dagan and deutscher  @xcite .",
    "they examined the splitting of a zero - bias conductance peak as a function of doping @xmath347 and an applied magnetic field , @xmath11 , perpendicular to the two - dimensional electron gas .",
    "they found that this splitting closely tracked the value @xmath379 as determined by minimizing the energy in ( [ g13 ] ) extended with a linear coupling to the magnetic field @xmath380 the linear coupling is also just that expected from the fact that the @xmath4 superconductor has a spontaneous orbital magnetic moment  @xcite .",
    "the experiments of ref .",
    "@xcite are able to scan across the critical point at @xmath342 , and observe behavior consistent with ( [ g19 ] ) ; we regard this as strong evidence for the phase diagram of fig  [ fig13 ] with a quantum critical point between @xmath3 and @xmath4 superconductors .",
    "it would be interesting if future experiments are able to test for the corrections to ( [ g19 ] ) discussed in section  [ qft ] .",
    "we also note here the recent measurements of yeh _ et al . _",
    "@xcite presenting evidence for related ( but somewhat different ) changes in the pairing symmetry in the overdoped regime .",
    "we have studied a number of phase transitions of two dimensional correlated electron systems and a schematic phase diagram summarizing their relevance to the high temperature superconductors was in fig  [ fig13 ] . at zero doping ,",
    "@xmath381 , we start from an insulating antiferromagnet with long range nel order . after a localized carrier regime at very low doping",
    ", the ground state at small @xmath347 appears to be superconducting with co - existing collinear spin - density wave order ( the sc+sdw phase ) .",
    "there is a long in - plane spin correlation length in this phase ( the finiteness of the correlation length is , we believe , due to disorder effects , and so at long enough scales the spin order is spin - glass like ) . at special commensurate dopings ( like @xmath382 ) the inter - plane coupling is strong enough to induce three - dimensional long - range order at finite temperatures .    at larger @xmath347",
    "there is a transition to a pure @xmath3 superconductor , and this transition was described in section  [ magd ] .",
    "charge order and its fluctuations also play a central role in the magnetic ordering quantum transition : we discussed these effects in the insulator in section  [ 2d ] .",
    "they also have an important effect near the corresponding sc+sdw to sc transition in the superconductor , but the reader is referred to  @xcite for a review of these .    with increasing @xmath347 , we argued on the basis of theoretical  @xcite and experimental studies  @xcite that the cuprate superconductors are at least in the vicinity of a separate transition from the @xmath3 superconductor to a @xmath4 superconductor .",
