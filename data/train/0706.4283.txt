    "over the past few years , an important research effort has been devoted to continuous - variable quantum key distribution ( qkd ) protocols , motivated by the prospects of realizing high - rate cryptosystems relying on homodyne detection instead of photon counting .",
    "these systems also have the advantage that they are based on standard ( low - cost ) telecom optical components , circumventing the need for single - photon sources nor single - photon detectors .",
    "in particular , gaussian qkd protocols have been extensively investigated first because they are conceptually simpler , but also mainly because their security can be rigorously assessed .",
    "the first proposed gaussian qkd protocol used squeezed states of light , which are modulated in one or the other quadrature ( @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) by the emitter ( alice ) , and are measured via homodyne detection by the receiver ( bob ) @xcite .",
    "although this protocol is a very natural continuous - variable counterpart of the famous bb84 protocol , its main drawback is the need for a source of squeezed light .",
    "a second gaussian qkd protocol was devised , in which alice generates coherent states ( instead of squeezed states ) which are then modulated both in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , while bob still performs homodyne detection @xcite . dealing with coherent states of light ( simply produced with a laser ) instead",
    "of squeezed or single - photon states makes this protocol very practical .",
    "this protocol , supplemented with the technique of reverse reconciliation , was experimentally demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that its range can , in principle , be arbitrarily large . note that , in these two protocols , bob randomly chooses to homodyning one quadrature , either @xmath0 or @xmath1 . in the squeezed - state protocol , bob then needs to reject the instances where he measured the other quadrature than the one modulated by alice ( this operation is called sifting ) , which results in a decrease of the key rate by a factor 2 . and @xmath1 provided that the key length is sufficiently large . ] in the coherent - state protocol , alice simply forgets the quadrature that is not measured by bob , which may look like a loss of efficiency .",
    "a third gaussian protocol was therefore proposed , in which alice still transmits doubly - modulated coherent states but bob performs heterodyne measurements , that is , he measures both quadratures @xmath0 and @xmath1 simultaneously @xcite ( this possibility was also suggested for postselection - based protocols in @xcite ) . at first sight , this seems to imply that the rate is doubled , since bob then acquires a pair of quadratures ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "actually , since heterodyne measurement effects one additional unit of vacuum noise on the measured quadratures , the two quadratures received by bob are noisier than the single quadrature in the homodyne - based protocol .",
    "the net effect , however , is generally an increase of the key rate when the two quadratures are measured simultaneously .",
    "this third protocol thus exhibits two advantages , namely that ( i ) the key rate is generally higher than for the homodyne - based coherent - state protocol , and ( ii ) there is no need to choose a random quadrature ( i.e. , no active basis choice is needed ) at bob s side . however , in order to make any definite statement on the security of this protocol , it is necessary to put precise limits on the maximum information accessible to an eavesdropper ( eve ) .",
    "surprisingly , although bounds on the optimal gaussian individual attack against this protocol had been derived in @xcite , it has remained unknown until now whether these bounds can be attained or not by an explicit eavesdropping strategy .",
    "these bounds were derived using similar techniques to those used for the other gaussian protocols , namely by writing heisenberg uncertainty relations . since for the protocols based on homodyne detection ,",
    "the corresponding heisenberg bounds can be attained by use of an explicit transformation ( the entangling cloner ) , it is tempting to conclude that the same is true for the heterodyne - based protocol . on the other hand , since no explicit scheme has been found to date that saturates these bounds ,",
    "another possibility is that these are loose , and tighter bounds remain to be found .    in this paper , we revisit the security of this coherent - state heterodyne - based gaussian protocol , and prove that the second above option is indeed true .",
    "we seek for the optimal gaussian individual attack by expressing the most general symplectic transformation characterizing eve s action and maximizing the information acquired by her .",
    "restricting to symplectic transformations is actually sufficient given that gaussian attacks are provably optimal among individual attacks @xcite .",
    "we conclude that this optimal attack is less powerful than expected , in the sense that we derive a tighter bound than that based on the heisenberg inequalities .",
    "we also exhibit optical schemes that precisely attain this bound , both in direct and reverse reconciliation .",
    "hence , the resulting lower bound on the secret key rate is higher than that based on the heisenberg uncertainty relations , making the heterodyne - based protocol even more efficient than originally thought .",
    "the gaussian protocol based on coherent states and heterodyne detection @xcite can be shown to be equivalent to an entanglement - based scheme @xcite , where alice prepares an epr state and applies an heterodyne measurement on mode @xmath3 , while bob applies an heterodyne measurement on mode @xmath4 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cohhet ] . we restrict ourselves to individual attacks , where eve completely controls the alice - to - bob channel separately for each transmitted state .",
    "since gaussian attacks are optimal among these attacks , we consider in what follows that eve effects a gaussian channel .",
    "consequently , the quantum state @xmath5 before alice and bob s measurements can be assumed to be a gaussian two - mode state with a zero mean value and a covariance matrix @xmath6 .",
    "usual gaussian channels , such as optical fibers , effect a symmetric and uncorrelated noise in both quadratures @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( including , of course , the loss - induced noise ) , so that we will only consider symmetric channels without @xmath0-@xmath1 correlations in what follows .",
    "since the epr state ( two - mode squeezed state ) is also symmetric and exhibits no correlations between @xmath0 and @xmath1 ,",
    "we can write the resulting covariance matrix in a block - diagonal form as @xmath7 with @xmath8 where the signs @xmath9 and @xmath10 correspond to @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively . here , @xmath13 is the variance of alice s output thermal state , while @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the transmittance and noise referred to the input of the gaussian channel [ the term @xmath16 stands for the loss - induced vacuum noise , while @xmath17 is the excess noise referred to the input ] .    , while the other half is sent to bob .",
    "after transmission via the channel , bob performs an heterodyne measurement , resulting in @xmath18 .",
    "the superscript ( 0 ) indicates that the corresponding state is the vacuum.,width=321 ]    in order to address the security of this protocol , we may , without loss of generality , assume that eve holds the purification of the quantum state @xmath5 . by measuring their systems , bob and eve then project alice s share of the joint pure state @xmath19 onto another pure state . applying the heisenberg uncertainty relation on the pure state held by",
    "alice ( conditioning on bob and eve s measurements ) , we have @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the canonically conjugate quadratures of alice s mode and @xmath23 is the conditional variance measuring the remaining uncertainty on @xmath24 after the measurement of @xmath25 , @xmath26 expressed in shot - noise units .",
    "equation ( [ eq : heisenbergdr ] ) also has a symmetric counterpart that reads , @xmath27 since we focus on a symmetric noise in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : heisenbergdr ] ) and ( [ eq : heisenbergdr2 ] ) can be unified into a single uncertainty relation @xmath28 where @xmath3 stands for any quadrature ( @xmath21 or @xmath22 ) of alice s mode .",
    "this inequality will be used to put a lower bound on the uncertainty of eve s estimate of the key in direct reconciliation ( dr ) , that is , when the key is made out of alice s data while bob and eve compete to estimate it .",
    "similarly , in reverse reconciliation ( rr ) , that is , when the key is made out of bob s data while alice and eve compete to estimate it , one can derive a dual inequality @xmath29 where @xmath4 stands for any quadrature of bob s mode .",
    "this will be used to put a lower bound on the uncertainty of eve s estimate of the key in rr .",

    "logically , two possibilities remain open : ( i ) these bounds are tight but the optimal attacks reaching them remain to be found ; ( ii ) these bound are not tight and the ( unknown ) optimal attacks can not saturate them . in order to answer this question ,",
    "we need to search for the optimal attack against this protocol with respect to all possible ( individual gaussian ) attacks that eve can do .",
    "although we are dealing with an infinite - dimensional hilbert space , this task remains tractable because of the fact that gaussian states and operations have a simple characterization in terms of first- and second - order moments of the quadratures .",

    "some symmetries also simplify the solution of this problem . before searching for the optimal attack ,",
    "let us consider these simplifications .      as we restrict eve s attacks to gaussian operations , it is trivial to see that eve must apply a gaussian unitary transformation on the mode sent by alice together with her ancillae , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eveattack ] . indeed , applying a gaussian completely positive maps instead of a unitary operation ( i.e. , discarding some ancillae ) can only make eve loose information on the secret key .",
    "the number of ancillae that eve needs is determined as follows .",
    "first , it is easy to see that eve needs at least two ancillary modes to estimate either alice s ( dr ) or bob s ( rr ) quadratures , since one is needed to get @xmath0 , the other to get @xmath1 .",

    "we may wonder what is so special about this no - switching protocol ? as a matter of fact , in the two gaussian protocols based on homodyne detection , one of the two quadratures plays a special role , namely the one that is measured by bob ( provided , in the squeezed - state protocol , that it is also the one modulated by alice ; otherwise the instance is discarded ) .",
    "the heisenberg uncertainty relations then express that any action on this quadrature , which carries the key , translates into some additional noise on the dual quadrature .",
    "monitoring the noise on this dual quadrature then puts an upper limit on the information potentially acquired by eve on the key - carrying quadrature .",

    "the security can be viewed as resulting from kind of an information conservation law through a `` fan - out '' channel ( leading to both bob and eve ) , akin to what is observed in the optimal estimation - vs - disturbance tradeoff for coherent states @xcite or in the asymmetric gaussian cloning of coherent states @xcite .",
