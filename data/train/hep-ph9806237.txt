    "the problem is that there is almost no overlap between quantities sensitive to @xmath0 which can be reliably calculated theoretically and those which can be measured experimentally . here",
    "i discuss two proposals which bridge this gap to some extent . in section",
    "ii the possibility of extracting @xmath0 from the hadron invariant mass spectrum in inclusive semileptonic @xmath1 decay is reviewed .",
    "section iii concerns extracting @xmath0 from a double ratio of form factors in exclusive semileptonic @xmath1 and @xmath12 decays to @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "section iv contains some conclusions .",
    "the traditional method for extracting @xmath0 from experimental data involves a study of the electron energy spectrum in inclusive charmless semileptonic @xmath1 decay @xcite . in the @xmath1 rest frame ,",
    "electrons with energies in the endpoint region @xmath16 must arise from @xmath17 transitions .",
    "there has been considerable theoretical progress recently in our understanding of inclusive semileptonic @xmath1 decay @xcite , based on the use of the operator product expansion ( ope ) and heavy quark effective theory . at leading order in the @xmath18 expansion",
    "the @xmath1 meson decay rate is equal to the @xmath19 quark decay rate .",
    "there are no nonperturbative corrections of order @xmath18 . in the electron endpoint region",
    "our calculational ability is lost , since the size of this region @xmath20mev is comparable to @xmath21 .",
    "an infinite set of higher order terms in the ope , which extend the endpoint from @xmath22 to @xmath23 , yield singular contributions to @xmath24 that are equally important integrated over such a small endpoint region .    in the future",
    ", it may be possible to determine @xmath0 from a comparison of the measured hadronic invariant mass spectrum in the region @xmath25 with theoretical predictions @xcite . here",
    "@xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the @xmath1 meson four - momentum , and @xmath28 is the sum of the lepton four - momenta .",
    "an obvious advantage to studying this quantity rather than the lepton energy spectrum is that most of the @xmath29 decays are expected to lie in the region @xmath25 , while only a small fraction of the @xmath29 decays have electron energies in the endpoint region .",
    "both the invariant mass region , @xmath25 , and the electron endpoint region , @xmath16 , receive contributions from hadronic final states with invariant masses that range up to @xmath30 .",
    "however , for the electron endpoint region the contribution of the states with masses nearer to @xmath30 is kinematically suppressed .",
    "this region is dominated by the @xmath31 and the @xmath13 in the isgw model @xcite , with higher mass states making only a small contribution .",
    "the situation is very different for the low invariant mass region , @xmath25 .",
    "now all states with invariant masses up to @xmath30 contribute without any preferential weighting towards the lowest mass ones . in the isgw model the @xmath31 and the @xmath13 mesons comprise only about a quarter of the @xmath1 decays to states with @xmath25 .",
    "consequently , it is much more likely that the first few terms in the ope will provide an accurate description of @xmath1 semileptonic decay in the region @xmath25 than in the endpoint region of the electron energy spectrum .",
    "in fact , from a theoretical point of view , the cut @xmath25 provides the optimal kinematical separation between inclusive @xmath3 and @xmath32 decays .",
    "a modest cut on the electron energy , which will probably be required experimentally for the direct measurement of @xmath33 via the neutrino reconstruction technique , will not destroy this conclusion .    to begin with , consider the contribution of dimension three operators in the ope to the hadron mass squared spectrum in @xmath29 decay .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath19 quark decay and implies a result for @xmath34 ( where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the energy and invariant mass of the strongly interacting partons arising from the @xmath19 quark decay ) that can easily be calculated using perturbative qcd up to order @xmath37 . even at this leading order in the ope",
    "there are important nonperturbative effects that come from the relation between the @xmath19 quark mass and the @xmath1 meson mass , @xmath38 .",
    "the most significant effect comes from @xmath39 , and it relates the hadronic invariant mass @xmath33 to @xmath40 and @xmath41 via @xmath42 changing variables from @xmath43 to @xmath44 and integrating @xmath41 over the range @xmath45 gives @xmath46 , where @xmath47 .",
    "feynman diagrams with only a @xmath48-quark in the final state contribute at @xmath49 , which corresponds to the region @xmath50 .",
    "although @xmath46 is integrable in perturbation theory , powers of @xmath51 $ ] occur in the invariant mass spectrum .",
    "this shows that perturbative and nonperturbative corrections are both important for @xmath52 .",
    "( in the @xmath53 limit perturbative corrections are important in a slightly larger region since @xmath54 for @xmath55 . )",
    "while @xmath56 can not be reliably predicted for @xmath57 , the behavior of the spectrum for @xmath58 becomes less important for observables that average over larger regions of the spectrum , such as @xmath46 integrated over @xmath59 , with @xmath60 significantly greater than @xmath61 .    in fig .  1 we plot the quantity @xmath62 defined by @xcite @xmath63 as a function of @xmath60 for @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66gev in the range @xmath67 , including terms up to order @xmath37 ( using @xmath68 ) .",

    "@xmath71 is the fraction of events with hadronic invariant mass less than @xmath60 .",
    "it is mostly the ability to compute @xmath62 and our knowledge of the value of @xmath39 which determine the uncertainty from theory in a value of @xmath0 extracted from the invariant mass spectrum in the region @xmath59 .",
    "= 8truecm    in the low mass region , @xmath58 , nonperturbative corrections from higher dimension operators in the ope are very important . just as in the case of the electron spectrum in the endpoint region  @xcite ,",

    ". then @xcite @xmath75 , \\ ] ] where @xmath76 is dimensionless .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath77 are the same ones that determine the shape functions for the semileptonic @xmath1 decay electron energy spectrum in the endpoint region , and also the photon energy endpoint region in weak radiative @xmath1 decay , @xmath78 the @xmath77 s have dimension of @xmath79^n$ ] , and hence the coefficients @xmath80 are dimensionless numbers of order one .",
    "the first few @xmath77 s are @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , etc .",
    "the shape function @xmath84 is an infinite sum of singular terms which gives an invariant mass spectrum that leaks out beyond @xmath85 ( i.e. , @xmath86 ) . for @xmath87 , all terms in eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) are formally of equal importance .",
    "since @xmath88 is not too far from @xmath89 , it is necessary to estimate the influence of the nonperturbative effects on the fraction of @xmath1 decays with invariant hadronic mass squared less than @xmath60 .",
    "it is difficult to obtain a model - independent estimate of the leakage of events above an experimental cutoff @xmath90 , given that we can estimate only the first few moments , @xmath77 .",
    "however , in the accmm model @xcite with reasonable parameters , the shape function @xmath84 causes a small ( i.e. , @xmath91 with @xmath92gev , and perturbative qcd corrections neglected ) fraction of the events to have @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "moreover , this leakage depends primarily on @xmath39 , and only to a lesser extent on other ingredients of the model .",
    "thus the analysis of both perturbative and nonperturbative corrections implies that the uncertainty in the determination of @xmath0 from the hadronic invariant mass spectrum in the region @xmath25 is largely controlled by the uncertainty in @xmath39 , or equivalently , by that in the @xmath19 quark mass .",
    "( there is a so - called renormalon ambiguity in @xmath39 and in the @xmath19 quark pole mass .",

    "heavy quark symmetry @xcite is much less predictive for heavy to light decays than it is for heavy to heavy transitions . in the infinite mass limit",
    "not all form factors are related to one another , and their normalization is not fixed at any kinematic point .",
    "there are still relations between semileptonic @xmath1 and @xmath12 decays to the same charmless exclusive final state @xcite , such as between @xmath9 and @xmath97 , or between @xmath10 and @xmath98 .",
    "the order @xmath99 corrections to the infinite mass limit may be sizable , however , and for final state pions there are additional complications since @xmath100 is comparable to the mass difference between the vector and pseudoscalar mesons @xcite .",
    "the question is whether we can construct an observable sensitive to @xmath8 that is ( almost ) free of @xmath99 corrections .",
    "the basic idea @xcite is to use heavy quark symmetry to relate the @xmath101 violation between @xmath102 and the cabibbo suppressed decay @xmath103 to those that occur in a comparison of @xmath104 ( or @xmath105 ) with @xmath106 .",
