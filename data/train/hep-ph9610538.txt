    "the successes of the nonrelativistic constituent quark models stimulate the study of the microscopic structure of the constituent quark .",
    "such a structure can not only influence predictions for many observables of the nucleon but also offer a possibility to derive an important part of the effective interaction between constituent quarks .",
    "the idea that the constituent quark is represented by a current quark surrounded by a chiral field , stems from georgi and manohar @xcite and has been further elaborated by cheng and li @xcite , and by baumgartner , pirner , knigsmann and povh @xcite in order to account for the parton counting in deep inelastic scattering ( related to the flavour asymmetry of sea quarks as given by the gottfried sum ; and to strangeness and spin content of the nucleon ) .",
    "we offer an explicit candidate for such a constituent quark : a soliton - like solution of a coherent state of pions and @xmath0-mesons around a massless quark in the linear @xmath0-model .",
    "the choice of a mesonic rather than gluonic description of the structure of the constituent quark is based on the experience that the scale for chiral symmetry breaking and emergence of chiral goldstone bosons appears at lower energies than the confinement scale where gluons dominate .",
    "the proposed picture may be a good representation of constituent quarks in the way they contribute to static properties of hadrons and to the low lying energy spectrum .",
    "it has been recently substantiated by several groups @xcite which demonstrated that the meson exchange effective potential between constituent quarks yields much more reasonable predictions for the baryon spectroscopy and the baryon - baryon interaction than the gluon exchange potential .",
    "one of the simplest models describing the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry is the linear @xmath0-model . in the non - strange sector",
    "it involves u and d quarks , a triplet of pions and the @xmath0-meson .",
    "the lagrangian density of the model @xcite takes the form : @xmath1 where different contributions in order represent the free quark part , the linear quark - meson interaction , the free meson part involving the @xmath0-mesons and the pions , and the meson self - interaction : @xmath2 the final term in ( [ potential ] ) is introduced to explicitly break the symmetry giving a finite mass to the pion .",
    "the model contains only one adjustable parameter , @xmath3 .",
    "the other three parameters , the chiral meson masses and the pion decay constant , are fixed to the corresponding experimental values ; we use @xmath4  mev and @xmath5  mev , for the mass of the @xmath0-meson we have taken a typical value , the recently suggested @xmath6  mev @xcite .",
    "the results , however , only weakly depend on the @xmath0-meson mass .",
    "we use coherent states to describe the pion and the @xmath0-meson clouds , and , furthermore , the `` hedgehog '' ansatz for the pion field and the current quark state  in complete analogy to the approaches in which the nucleon is described as a meson cloud surrounding the three valence quarks @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic state takes the form @xmath7 here @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the creation operators for the @xmath0-meson and the pion , respectively , in the spherical basis and @xmath10 is the third component of isospin ; @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 represent the u ( d ) quark with spin down ( up ) , respectively .",
    "only @xmath15-wave @xmath0-mesons and @xmath16-wave pions are coupled to the quark .",
    "the functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 are related to the expectation values of the field operators as @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the fourier transforms of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the physical states are obtained by performing the peierls - yoccoz projection @xmath23 using the grand spin symmetry of the hedgehog , the evaluation of physical quantities between the projected states is considerably simplified ; details of the calculation technique as well as a discussion of the validity of the hedgehog approximation can be found in @xcite .",
    "the _ ansatz _ ( [ hedgehog],[projection ] ) leads to a system of coupled nonlinear differential equations which are solved using the package _ colsys _ @xcite .",
    "we also impose a constraint that ensures the correct asymptotic behaviour of the pion field which is , otherwise , not automatically satisfied in this type of variational approach @xcite . we have found a selfconsistent solution with @xmath24 for the range @xmath25 ( fig .",
    "1 ) ; we shall call this solution the _ quark soliton _ ( qs)-model with @xmath26 was first discussed by v.  soni in the context of the maximum fermion mass @xcite . ] . for lower values of @xmath3 , the trivial solution @xmath27 , @xmath28 has a lower energy while for larger @xmath3 , the valence orbital already drops into the dirac sea .    in the constituent quark models the quark mass is usually taken between 310  mev and 390  mev ; from fig .",
    "1 one might naively expect to reproduce these values for @xmath29 .",
    "however , the model possesses another nontrivial approximate solution representing the nucleon  the _ nucleon soliton _ ( ns )  in which the three current quarks are surrounded by a common pion and @xmath0-meson cloud @xcite and here the experimental nucleon mass can be reproduced for @xmath3 below @xmath30 .",
    "since the soliton energy decreases with @xmath3 higher values are not physically admissible for the qs either . for @xmath31",
    "the energy of the soliton is rather independent of @xmath3 and is around 550  mev which is considerably higher than a typical mass of the constituent quark .",
    "this may not be a too serious shortcoming of the model for the following two reasons : ( i ) as we shall show in the following , there exist a strong attractive interaction between the qss due to meson exchange which considerably lowers the energy of the three - qs system , ( ii ) the present solution is strongly localized and the energy of the soliton contains a large contribution of the kinetic energy of the spurious center - of - mass motion .",
    "both effects allow the existence of a solitonic solution also for @xmath3 below 5.7 ; we may even expect that the physically sensible solution should be sought below 5 .    in order to investigate point ( ii ) and to be able to obtain a stable one - quark soliton solution in the physically relevant range of @xmath3 it would be important to perform , in addition to the angular momentum , also the linear momentum projection .",
    "techniques for linear momentum projection were developed in soliton models @xcite and for combined linear and angular momentum projection @xcite .",
    "the resulting lowering of the soliton energy is rather strong , in the case of the qs even exaggerated .",
    "we have found out that the strong effect is primarily due to the assumption that the negative energy dirac sea orbitals are plane waves , while in fact they are distorted by the soliton .",
    "this distortion diminishes the effect of projection , especially since some negative energy states become localized . in order to get reliable center - of - mass corrections ,",
    "dirac sea polarization should be implemented .",
    "this work is in progress .",
    "the main challenge of the model is to build hadrons from the quark solitons . in the following sections we shall present a simple model of the nucleon assuming that the qss preserve their identity in the baryon",
    "this is a very strong assumption since it implies that the system of three interacting qss is energetically more favourable than the ns .",
    "it would have to be investigated using more sophisticated approaches ( e.g. removal of center - of - mass motion of a single qs , solving the faddeev equations for the three quark system , @xmath32 ) which are far beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "though we are not able in the present approach to generate stable solitons in the physically interesting range , it is still interesting to study their properties at somehow larger @xmath3 .",
    "as we shall show in the following , several properties depend only weakly on the parameter @xmath3 and we may expect that they will , at least qualitatively , persist when more sophisticated approaches are used .",
    "in table 1 we summarize the static properties of the qs .",
    "the average number of pions ( @xmath33 ) is not a physical observable , nonetheless , it is an important tool in analyzing the flavour and spin content of the nucleon .",
    "the violation of the gottfried sum rule , the drell - yan process and the deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering measuring various quark contributions to the nucleon spin can well be understood assuming the quarks are surrounded by a pion cloud @xcite .",
    "the parameter of this analysis , @xmath34 , representing the probability for the @xmath35 pion in the cloud , would lead to @xmath36 if two- and more pion configurations are neglected .",
    "since the determination of this parameter is model dependent and still very inconclusive , our values in table 1 are consistent with @xmath37 from ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath38 from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    ".static properties of the constituent quark . for comparison ,",
    "the nucleon properties deduced from the three - qs system ( @xmath39 ) , those calculated for the nucleon soliton ( ns ) , and the experimental values are given .",
    "the notation @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) refer to u ( d ) constituent quark or to proton ( neutron ) , respectively .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     the value for the constituent quark - pion coupling constant @xmath42 leads to a good agreement of @xmath43 with the experimental value .",
    "the contribution of the meson self - interaction is significant ( @xmath44  % ) .",
    "the axial current acquires an important contribution from the @xmath0 and the pion field , and using a simple relation @xmath45 leads to too large a value of @xmath46 for the nucleon .",
    "the meson fields of constituent quarks may considerably alter in the nucleon giving rise to effective exchange ( axial ) currents which may eventually reduce this value .",
    "the magnetic moments are too small , yet not too far from the corresponding dirac values ( e.g. @xmath47 ) .",
    "we can therefore expect that reducing the mass of the qs in an improved computational scheme would increase the proton and the neutron magnetic moments , @xmath48 , to more acceptable values .",
    "similarly as for @xmath46 , the effective exchange currents may yield an important contribution also in this case .",
    "the calculated charge radii pertain to the size of the constituent quark . to obtain the nucleon charge radius we have taken into account the orbital motion of the constituent",
    "quarks in the nucleon as discussed in the next section .",
    "the nucleon charge radius would be considerably increased if the vector mesons were introduced ; our values are therefore not inconsistent with the experiment .",
    "we have calculated the chiral meson exchange effective potentials between constituent quarks using the born oppenheimer approximation . while the assumption that the qs behaves as a static source of mesons can be justified in the case of the pion because of its small mass compared to that of the qs , it is certainly not appropriate for the @xmath0-meson . lacking a more consistent approach in which recoil effects are taken into account , the resulting @xmath0-exchange potential should be regarded only as a crude approximation .",
    "we give here explicit expressions for the contributions arising from the quark - meson interaction in ( [ lagrangian ] ) which dominate . the meson self - interaction ( [ potential ] )",
    "yields the pion and @xmath0-exchange potentials of similar shapes as the corresponding ones arising from the quark - meson interaction ; they merely increase the strength of the total potentials by some 20  % .",
    "the quark contribution to the static @xmath0-exchange potential is simply : @xmath49 where the index @xmath34 refers to the qs positioned at the origin and @xmath50 to the qs positioned at @xmath51 , @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) is the quark bispinor upper ( lower ) component , and @xmath54 is the angle between @xmath51 and @xmath55 . the potential , including also the contribution from ( [ potential ] ) , is attractive for all @xmath56 .",
    "its value at the origin is @xmath57  mev and has a harmonic shape with @xmath58  gev/@xmath59 at small @xmath56 .",
    "asymptotically it has a typical yukawa behaviour with the mass @xmath60 ( rather than @xmath61 ) as a consequence of remaining close to the chiral circle .    in order to write down the pion exchange potential we first notice that the pion field of the qs can be written in the form : @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are , respectively , the spin and isospin operators acting on dressed ( constituent ) quarks .",
    "similarly , the quark - pion interaction term in ( [ lagrangian ] ) can be manipulated : @xmath65 yielding the quark contribution to the pion exchange potential : @xmath66 where @xmath67 , and @xmath68 and @xmath69 now act on current quarks .",
    "the potential ( [ pionex ] ) contains the scalar as well the tensor part . the scalar part of the pion exchange potential including also the contribution from the meson self - interaction ( [ potential ] ) can be written in the form @xmath70 ; @xmath71 is shown in fig .  2 and compared to some commonly used potentials in the constituent quark model calculations of the baryon spectra @xcite .",
    "we reproduce well its asymptotic behaviour  which reflects the fact that the pion coupling constant is also well reproduced in the model  while the internal part has a too large range .",
    "it could be reduced by going to stronger @xmath3 but this is physically not desirable .",
    "the large range is partially due to spurious center - of - mass motion so we may expect that its size would be reduced by removing this effect .",
    "since our calculation gives just a crude picture of the potentials , we have made only a simple estimate of the size of the nucleon and the @xmath72(1232 ) by assuming harmonic oscillator wave functions @xmath73 to describe the orbital motion of each qs and determined the parameter @xmath50 variationally .",
    "it is interesting to notice that both baryons are bound even without including the confining potential .",
    "using @xmath74 the rms radius of the orbital motion is @xmath75  fm for the nucleon and @xmath76  fm for the @xmath72 ; the energy difference between the nucleon and the @xmath72 is only 43  mev . including a linear confining potential @xmath77 and using a popular value @xmath78  gev / fm , reduces the rms radii to @xmath79  fm and @xmath80  fm ; while the energy difference increases to 125  mev . using the values for",
    "the internal sizes of the u and d quark the charge radii of the proton and the neutron are estimated and displayed in table  1 .",
    "let us stress that the strength of the attractive part of @xmath81 is almost entirely determined by the condition @xmath82 which holds for any pseudoscalar meson exchange effective interaction , and through this condition to the value of the quark - pion coupling constant which is , in turn , constrained by the experimental value of @xmath83 .",
    "by shrinking the width of the attractive part ( see e.g. fig .",
    "2 ) , its strength can be increased but not to the extent to bring the @xmath72-n splitting up to the experimental value .",
    "we have shown that the linear @xmath0-model is a suitable framework for the microscopic description of constituent quarks .",
    "it requires no new model parameters and gives sensible predictions about the effective interaction between constituent quarks as well as about different static properties of the baryon .",
    "while the present results are still based on a rather simplified approach designed to explore the trends , their relative success encourages the use of more sophisticated techniques .",
    "the pion - exchange effective potential between constituent quarks has a similar shape as the phenomenological potential used in ref @xcite . since",
    "a strong attractive part has been shown @xcite to be needed to give simultaneously a good n-@xmath72 splitting as well as the correct ordering of the roper and negative parity states we anticipate that some important mechanisms are still to be included in order to model this type of interaction .",
    "possible candidates are : removal of center - of - mass motion of each constituent quark , nonadiabadic corrections , three - body forces between constituent quarks , inclusion of @xmath84 mesons in the model .",
    "we get a rather strong @xmath0-exchange potential .",
    "its role in the linear @xmath0-model may be also to mimic a part of the confining potential at low energies as well as to strongly reduce the energy of the system so that the `` effective constituent mass '' of quarks in hadrons is considerably less than the calculated mass for an isolated constituent quark .",
