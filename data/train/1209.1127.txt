    "electronic mach - zehnder interferometers ( mzis ) built from quantum hall edge states have attracted a great deal of recent interest , particularly because it has been found that they show striking non - equilibrium behaviour.heiblum1,heiblum2,litvin07,roulleau07,neder07,heiblum3,litvin08,roulleau08,roulleauthese,roulleau,roulleau09,bieri08,litvin2010 in these mesoscopic devices , quantum hall ( qh ) edge states form the arms of an interferometer , joined at two points by quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) that serve as beam - splitters .",
    "aharonov - bohm ( ab ) oscillations in the differential conductance of the device are observed@xcite as either the applied magnetic field or the length of one of the interferometer arms is varied .",
    "effects out of equilibrium are probed by studying the visibility of ab oscillations as a function of bias voltage : remarkably , the visibility does not decrease monotonically with bias , but rather shows a sequence of ` lobes ' separated by zeros or deep minima.@xcite    while theoretical work@xcite investigating decoherence in electronic mzis predates these experiments , the problem of understanding the origin of the observed lobe pattern has provided a fresh focus for such efforts.cheianov,chgv,sukhorukov,levk,neder08,sim08,kovrizhin1,mirlin starting from a description of edge states as one - dimensional interacting chiral conductors,@xcite two main alternatives have emerged .",
    "one @xcite is that the phenomenon is specific to landau level filling factor @xmath1 , and arises because in this case there are two types of collective modes @xcite with different velocities .",
    "the other,@xcite worked out for @xmath2 , is that the phenomenon is due to multiparticle interference effects and requires finite - range , rather than contact interactions .    in this paper",
    "we set out an approach that yields exact results for a model of an mzi at @xmath3 with contact interactions and arbitrary qpc tunneling probabilities , offering a test of previous perturbative @xcite and approximate @xcite calculations .",
    "our approach circumvents a serious technical obstacle in the study of qh edge states coupled by qpcs , which is that interactions are most easily handled using bosonization , vondelftschoeller , giamarchi but this transformation converts the tunneling hamiltonian from a one - body operator in fermionic coordinates to a non - linear ( cosine ) form in bosonic coordinates .",
    "weak tunneling ( or tunneling probability close to one ) can then be treated perturbatively , cheianov , chgv , sukhorukov but additional ideas are necessary in order to study the situation realised in most experiments , with tunneling probabilities close to one half .",
    "two ways around this difficulty have been discussed previously .",
    "one@xcite provides numerically exact results , but for simplified models in which electrons interact only when they are inside the interferometer .",
    "the other@xcite can be applied to a general model of electron interactions , but has so far been implemented within an approximation scheme .",
    "the complementary route we describe here combines bosonization with refermionisation@xcite to arrive ( for the simplest case of equal - length interferometer arms ) at a transformed set of fermion creation and annihilation operators , in terms of which the full mzi hamiltonian is quadratic .",
    "similar methods were used recently by two of us@xcite to treat the related problempierre2010,quench2009 of equilibration in a qh edge state , downstream from a single biased qpc .",
    "our main result is that there are important differences between the behaviour of a model for an mzi at @xmath4 with only contact interactions and what has been observed experimentally .",
    "some of these differences are already apparent in behaviour at weak tunneling , computed in ref .  .",
    "in particular for an interferometer with arms of equal length , which is the intended situation in most experiments , the visibility of interference fringes is not suppressed at large bias voltage .",
    "one might have hoped that the differences would be reduced or removed outside the weak - tunneling limit , but we show this is not the case . we conclude that , while models with contact interactions show oscillations of fringe visibility with bias voltage , they are not sufficient even outside the weak tunnelling limit to explain the envelope of the observed ` lobe pattern ' ; instead allowance must be made for an additional ingredient ( see ref .   for some possibilities ) .",
    "we note , in contrast , that both oscillations and a decaying envelope can arise from finite - range interactions , as discussed in refs .  .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "[ model ] we define the model we study for the electronic mzi , and in section refermionization we set out the bosonization and refermionisation transformations that we use .",
    "we give analytical results for interferometers with arms of equal length in section [ analytical ] , and describe our approach to interferometers with arms of different lengths in section unequal , presenting numerical results for this case in section unequal - results .",
    "finally , in section [ discussion ] we discuss our results in relation to past theoretical work and experimental observations . the numerical procedure used in evaluating the correlators",
    "is outlined in appendix [ numerics ] , and some comparisons with perturbation theory are given in appendix perturbation .",
    "we consider the model of an electronic mach - zehnder interferometer that is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_model ] .",
    "the mzi operates in the @xmath1 qh regime and is constructed from two quantum hall edges labelled by an index @xmath5 .",
    "each of these edges carries two chiral electron channels with spin labels @xmath6 .",
    "two quantum point contacts @xmath7 and @xmath8 , with positions separated by distance @xmath9 on the edge @xmath10 and @xmath11 on edge 2 , induce electron tunnelling between channels 1@xmath12 and 2@xmath12 . two other channels , 1@xmath13 and 2@xmath13 , are coupled to the rest of the system via contact interactions .",

    "in the second , which we refer to as two - channel bias ( tcb ) , both channels 1@xmath331@xmath12 are at the same non - zero chemical potential , as in the experiments of ref .  .",
    "in calculations we establish a steady state for the interferometer by using the hamiltonian @xmath14 to time - evolve from the distant past an initial state @xmath34 with the specified chemical potentials in each channel .",

    "the steady - state current is then @xmath45 where the bias voltage @xmath46 enters through the definition of @xmath47 .",
    "an important characteristic of electronic mzis which quantifies the coherence and is measured in experiments , is the _ visibility _ of aharonov - bohm oscillations .",
    "it can be expressed in terms of the differential conductance @xmath48 as the ratio@xmath49here @xmath50 is the maximum / minimum of the differential conductance as a function of ab - phase at a fixed bias voltage .",

    "we use a sequence of transformations to calculate the current in the model for an mzi defined in the previous section .",
    "our approach ( building on earlier work@xcite by two of us ) combines a treatment of interactions using bosonization with a fermionic description of the tunneling at qpcs , and can be separated into three steps .",
    "first , we bring the hamiltonian @xmath51 into quadratic form in a standard way using bosonization .",

    "we discuss the physical reasons for these changes and present detailed numerical results .      suppression of interference fringe visibility at high bias for an mzi with @xmath207 is due in our treatment to fluctuations in the phase @xmath208 , appearing in eq .",
    "( [ iab2 ] ) .",
    "the bias dependence of these fluctuations arises via the contributions from @xmath209 and @xmath210 to @xmath110 [ see eq .",

    "bias dependent fluctuations in @xmath217 come from particles that pass qpc @xmath7 during the portions of these time intervals that do not overlap , since the contribution of such particles to @xmath218 depends on whether they tunnel . developing this picture , one can identify two separate regimes , according to the value of the ratio @xmath219 .",
    "for @xmath220 it is the intervals @xmath221 and @xmath222 that contribute to fluctuations of @xmath110 , while in the opposite case @xmath223 it is the intervals @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",
    "the scale for the bias voltage at which interference is suppressed is the one at which the fluctuations in particle number within an energy window @xmath30 and on the given intervals are @xmath226 .",
    "if @xmath227 , this scale is @xmath228 , where for @xmath229 the relevant energy is @xmath230\\}^{-1}\\]]and for @xmath220 it is @xmath231\\}^{-1}.\\]]as expected , this voltage scale diverges both in the non - interacting limit and for equal arm lengths .",
    "a related argument can be used to understand why , for two - channel bias , oscillations in visibility occur only with arms of unequal length . in this case",
    "the relevant feature is the bias - dependence of the average value of @xmath218 , rather than its fluctuations . for two - channel bias",
    "we find @xmath232the effect of this bias - dependent phase can be modelled by including it in the integrand of eq .  ( [ i - tcb ] ) , making the replacement @xmath233 .",
    "then for @xmath234 the visibility is @xmath235it has oscillations as a function of bias , with an amplitude that vanishes for equal arm lengths .      in this section",
    "we present numerically exact results for the visibility and phase of interference fringes in the differential conductance of a mzi , obtained by evaluating eq .",
    "( [ iab2 ] ) using the methods outlined in appendix [ numerics ] .",

    "for @xmath237 the visibility oscillates with constant amplitude as a function of bias voltage , following eq .",

    "the energy scale of oscillations is @xmath239 and diverges in the non - interacting limit .",
    "for @xmath240 the visibility develops a decaying envelope on the energy scale @xmath241 or @xmath242 ( depending on the value of @xmath243 ) , minima in visibility are no longer exact zeros , and the steps in the phase as a function of bias are smooth .",
    "variations with the tunnelling probability @xmath244 are shown in fig",
    ".  scb_angles .",
    "when the qpc @xmath7 is tuned away from the half - transparency , the visibility and the phase of ab - fringes become irregular functions of bias voltage .",
    "changes in @xmath245 alter only the overall scale for the visibility , and not the form of its dependence on bias .",
    "the dependence of interference on difference in arm lengths and on interaction strength is shown for an mzi with two - channel bias and @xmath246 in fig .",
    "[ tcb_lengths ] . for equal arm lengths",
    "the visibility is independent of bias and the phase of ab - fringes varies linearly with voltage , following eq .",
    "( [ gii ] ) .",
    "for @xmath247 the visibility develops small amplitude oscillations and is suppressed at large bias : the voltage period of oscillations is consistent with the value @xmath248 expected from eq .",
    "( [ vis - tcb ] ) .",
    "the variation of phase with voltage is no longer exactly linear but shows no well - defined steps .",
    "results for several values of @xmath244 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ tcb_angles ] : oscillations of visibility with bias are irregular but some well - defined minima develop for values far from @xmath249 .      from the discussion in section [ qualitative ]",
    "we expect the voltage scale for the suppression of visibility at high bias to be set by @xmath250 .",
    "behaviour consistent with this is shown in fig .",
    "fig_gaussian : here @xmath251 for all parameter sets , and @xmath252 sets a common voltage scale to the envelope for visibility oscillations .",
    "we note that for @xmath249 this envelope is approximately gaussian .",
    "in this section we discuss our results in relation to experimental observations and previous theoretical work . to summarise briefly : building on techniques developed in earlier studies @xcite we have presented exact analytical and numerical results for the non - equilibrium behaviour of an electronic mach - zehender interferometer built from quantum hall edge states at filling factor @xmath1 , using a model with only contact interactions .",
    "a key feature of the results is that , for an interferometer with nearly equal arm lengths , two scales are present in the dependence of fringe visibility on bias voltage : oscillations in visibility have the voltage period @xmath253 , with @xmath254 , while their envelope falls off on the larger scale @xmath255 .",
    "a further feature is that oscillations in visibility are much clearer in one bias scheme ( single - channel bias ) than in an alternative scheme ( two - channel bias ) . finally , ab fringes show a varying degree of phase rigidity under small changes in bias : for single - channel bias it is perfect when arm lengths are equal , but decreases with increasing @xmath256 ; for two - channel bias it is absent if arm lengths are equal , and otherwise at most limited .    some but not all aspects of these results match observations .",
    "most importantly , the originally reported @xcite ` lobe pattern ' is reproduced by calculations for the experimentally appropriate single - channel bias scheme with @xmath240 ( see fig .",
    "[ scb_lengths ] ) .",
    "in addition , as previously discussed in the perturbative context , @xcite the differences in behaviour between the two bias schemes ( compare ref .   with ref .",
    ") are matched by differences in calculated behaviour ( compare fig .",
    "[ scb_lengths ] with fig .",
    "[ tcb_lengths ] ) . on the other hand , as at most a few oscillations of visibility are observed in the lobe pattern , @xcite the voltage scales for oscillations and for their envelope are not well - separated : since the samples concerned are intended to have almost equal arm lengths , this is at variance with the behaviour of the model we study .",
    "moreover , intentional changes in the length of an arm appear to have a much smaller effect experimentally @xcite than in our calculations .",
    "it is interesting to go beyond these qualitative comparisons and attempt an estimate of the key theoretical parameter , @xmath161 , which characterises interaction strength in our model .",
    "this is possible using measurements by roulleau and collaborators , described in ref .  . the relevant experiment , in the notation of our fig .",
    "[ fig_model ] , involves applying separate biases to the channels @xmath257 and @xmath258 , with the other two channels grounded .",
    "specifically , applying a voltage to @xmath259 , this channel acts as a modulation gate , changing the phase of ab oscillations in conductance . from fig .",
    "5.17a of ref .  , a bias of 49@xmath260v generates a phase shift of @xmath261 in a sample with @xmath262 . using the results described in section [ analytical ] we obtain from these data the value @xmath263 .",
    "remarkably , this is very close to the estimate ( @xmath264 ) obtained in ref .   from a theoretical fit of an experiment on equilibration of qhe edge states ,",
    "although in general @xmath161 is expected to vary with sample design and magnetic field strength .",
    "our results should also be compared with a body of earlier theoretical work , which ( apart from the early study of ref .  ) can be separated into investigations of the effects of long range interactions , @xcite and calculations for the model @xcite with contact interactions that we have studied here .",
    "the initial treatment of this model @xcite was perturbative in the tunnelling amplitude at the two qpcs , and so appropriate for @xmath265 or @xmath266 , while an approximate non - perturbative approach has been described in ref .  .",
    "the advance we have presented here is to handle tunnelling exactly .",
    "the successes and weaknesses of the perturbative calculations @xcite in accounting for observations are similar to the ones we have described above . in particular , the fact that the voltage scale for suppression of ab oscillations is set by the difference in arm lengths , and diverges for @xmath267 appears at the perturbative level . knowing only the original , leading order result , sukhorukov one might have hoped that contributions higher order in @xmath244 would eliminate ab oscillations at large bias for all @xmath268 ( as happens when shot noise is introduced using a separate qpc @xcite ) .",
    "the calculations we have described show ( in agreement with the approximation of ref .  ) that this is not the case .",
    "an implication of the work we have presented is that one must take account of long range interactions in order to understand in full experiments on non - equilibrium effects in mzis .",
    "calculations that do include long range interactions @xcite successfully reproduce many aspects of the observations , but have been done for @xmath269 while much of the published data are for @xmath4 .",
    "approaches such as the one of ref .   that include both long range interactions and",
    "the two channels present at @xmath4 are therefore desirable . in this context , the results we have presented provide a testing ground for approximation schemes .",
    "interestingly , the same model for qh edge states that we have studied here , of contact interactions at @xmath4 , seems to account more successfully for experiments on relaxation of a non - equilibrium electron distribution @xcite than for the behaviour of an mzi with equal length arms .",
    "while we have no detailed understanding of this difference , we point out that ab interference is a more sensitive probe of the qh edge than a measurement of the electron distribution .",
    "in particular , if as is likely , weak long range interactions are present in addition to contact interactions , they can be expected to suppress interference in a mzi at high bias @xcite without much changing @xcite the observed relaxation process . in outlook",
    ", we hope that it will be possible to extend the techniques we have developed here to treat other phenomena in edge states far from equilibrium .",
