    "in the classical problem of optimal investment , an economic agent trades at exogenous stock prices and looks for a strategy maximizing his expected utility .",
    "this problem has been extensively studied in the literature with various approaches .",
    "for example , merton @xcite relied on pdes , kramkov and schachermayer @xcite used the methods of convex duality and martingales and hu et al .",
    "@xcite employed bsdes .    in this paper , we consider an inverse problem : find stock prices for which a given strategy is optimal ; that is , instead of the usual task of getting `` ( optimal stocks ) quantities from prices '' we want to deduce `` prices from quantities . ''",
    "this problem naturally arises in the market microstructure theory ; see grossman and miller @xcite , garleanu et al . @xcite and german @xcite . here",
    ", the strategy represents the continuous demand on the market for a set of divided - paying stocks .",
    "the representative dealer , with exponential utility , provides liquidity for these assets and quotes prices in such a way that the market clears . in @xcite and @xcite , the existence and uniqueness of such prices is established for every _ simple _ demand process , where trades occur only a finite number of times .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to cover the general case .    as a first step ,",
    "we obtain in theorem  [ th:1 ] an equivalent characterization of the demand - based prices in terms of solutions to a system of bsdes with quadratic growth .",
    "similar systems appear naturally in economic equilibrium problems with exponential preferences ; see frei and dos reis @xcite .",
    "contrary to the one - dimensional case , which is well studied and where general criteria for existence and uniqueness are available ( see , e.g. , kobylanski @xcite and briand and hu @xcite ) , the situation with a _ system _ of quadratic bsdes is more delicate .",
    "a counter - example in @xcite shows that , in general , such system may not have solutions even for a _ bounded _ terminal condition .",
    "moreover , although the existence can be guaranteed when the values at maturity are sufficiently small ( see proposition  1 in tevzadze @xcite ) , the uniqueness is only obtained in a local manner .",
    "our main results are stated in theorem  [ th:2 ] and proposition  [ prop:1 ] . in theorem  [ th:2 ] , we prove that the solutions to our system of quadratic bsdes exist and are ( globally ) unique , provided that the product of the @xmath0-norm of the stocks dividends , the @xmath1-norm of the demand and the dealer s risk - aversion is sufficiently small . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first study that proves a ( global ) uniqueness result for a system of fully coupled quadratic bsdes . in proposition",
    "[ prop:1 ] , we show that , in general , such well - posedness may be violated even if the dividends and the demand are bounded . a crucial role in our study is played by the `` sharp '' a priori estimate given in lemma  [ lem:2 ] .",
