    "the development of accurate and efficient schemes to calculate the dynamic response in quantum impurity models remains one of the greatest challenge in chemical and condensed matter physics .",
    "significant advances have been made in the context of the spin - boson model,@xcite in which a single impurity spin is coupled to a bosonic bath at equilibrium.@xcite addressing the dynamics in quantum impurity models driven away from equilibrium by the application of a bias voltage , is much more challenging , and most bruit - force real - time techniques are limited to relatively short times.@xcite    this short - coming associated with the well - known dynamical sign problem can be lifted by combining real - time impurity solvers with a reduced - density matrix formalism.@xcite the basic idea is that the total system can be decomposed into two parts - an interesting part we call `` the system '' and an environment collectively called `` the bath '' to which the quantum system is coupled .",
    "the exact calculation of the dynamics within this formulation is often given in terms of the nakajima ",
    "mori _ time - convolution _ ( tc ) approach  @xcite derived from the unitary dynamics of the full hilbert space using projection operator techniques . in this formalism , the complexity of solving the many - body quantum liouville von - newmann equation is reduced to the evaluation of a super - operator so - called the `` memory kernel '' which fully determines the non - markovian dynamics of the system.@xcite since the decay of the system typically exceeds the characteristic decay time of the memory kernel , brute - force numerical impurity solvers limited to short times can be used to extract the kernel , from which the long - time dynamics can be obtained.@xcite this approach has proven fruitful for spin magnetization dynamics  @xcite in the nonequilibrium anderson impurity model  @xcite driven by electron - electron correlations and for nonadiabatic dynamics and bistability  @xcite in the nonequilibrium extended holstein model  @xcite driven by electron - phonon correlations .",
    "this formalism is also widely used as a starting point to derive perturbative schemes for fermionic systems ,  @xcite and has gained attention in other fields as well.@xcite    an alternative to the tc generalized quantum master equation is based on tokuyama ",
    "mori _ time - convolutionless _ ( tcl )",
    "quantum master equation.@xcite the technique eliminates the dependence of the time evolution on the history of the system and replaces the integro - differential tc equation with a first order differential equation , which is exact and local in time.@xcite in the tcl quantum master equation , the tc memory kernel is replaced by a time - local super - operator referred to as the tcl generator or kernel .",
    "a direct calculation of the tcl generator is extremely difficult since it relies on finding an inverse to a super - operator in the full hilbert space.@xcite thus , in nearly all applications of the tcl approach , a perturbative scheme in the system - bath coupling is used to obtain the tcl generator.@xcite an attempt to formulate a non - perturbative path - integral approach to calculate the kernel has been proposed recently.@xcite    in this work we adopt a different approach to calculate the tcl kernel based on the reduced density propagator  @xcite and show that the matrix elements of this 4-ranked tensor can be obtained directly from the population and coherences of the reduced system alone .",
    "while this connection may seem redundant , in fact , it offers two important advantages : first , since the tcl generator decays on a faster time - scale compared to the decay of the populations and coherences themselves , one can use numerically converged impurity solvers to obtain the tcl generator at short - times and infer about the converged system dynamics on any time scale , similar to the cutoff method used in the tc approach.@xcite second , an alternative diagrammatic expansion based on the nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) approach offers means to systematically expand the kernel beyond second or fourth order in the system - bath coupling .",
    "we implement the tcl approach to study the population dynamics in the resonant level model  @xcite , analyze the time scales for the decay of the tcl kernel as a function of temperature ( @xmath0 ) , source - drain bias ( @xmath1 ) and gate voltage ( @xmath2 ) , and compare it to the decay of the tc memory kernel .",
    "we find that both kernels decay on an identical time scale and thus , in this respect , neither formulations is advantageous .",
    "however , the tcl formulation requires only system dependent quantities as input , quantities that are often easier to generate using a numerically converged impurity solvers .",
    "consider an open quantum system coupled to an environment representing the `` bath '' degrees of freedom , described by the full hamiltonian : @xmath3 where @xmath4 describes the system and bath hamiltonians , and @xmath5 the coupling between the two .",
    "the time evolution of the full density matrix is given by the liouville ",
    "von - neumann equation , @xmath6\\equiv{\\cal l}\\rho\\left(t\\right)$ ] , for which a numerical converged solution is impossible to obtain due to the exponential scaling complexity with the size of the system and bath .",
    "however , in most situations the dynamics of the bath is not interesting and thus , one is concerned with the time evolution of the system alone , described by the reduced density matrix , @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the density matrix of the initial state of the bath and @xmath10 is a projection operator onto the system subspace .",
    "there are two different approaches to describe the time evolution of @xmath11 : ( a ) the nakajima ",
    "mori _ time - convolution _ approach  @xcite and ( b ) the tokuyama ",
    "mori _ time - convolutionless _",
    "approach.@xcite    for the former ( tc ) , the equation of motion for @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 $ ] and the memory kernel ( a super - operator in the system subspace ) is given by @xmath14 with @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the unit operator ) .",
    "for the latter ( tcl ) , the equation of motion for the reduced density operator is given in terms of a time - local kernel:@xcite @xmath17 in the above equation , the tcl kernel ( a super - operator in the system subspace ) is defined by    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is a super - operator in the _ full _ hilbert space of the system and bath . in the above equations ,",
    "we have assumed a factorized initial condition , @xmath20 . for a correlated initial state , an additional term",
    "should be included in both the tc and tcl equations for @xmath11.@xcite    the complication of solving for the reduced density operator is manifested through the tc or tcl kernels .",
    "in fact , it seems more complicated to solve for the kernels than obtaining the full density operator @xmath21 , since both @xmath22 and @xmath23 involve projected propagation @xmath24 and furthermore , the tcl kernel requires an inversion of a super - operator in the full hilbert space . however , the reduced density operator formalism offers two main advantages .",
    "first , when formulated in the interaction picture , the tc and tcl approaches are useful as a starting point for approximate methods , such as the second order perturbation in the system - bath coupling leading to the redfield equations .",
    "second , if the dynamics governing @xmath22 or @xmath23 are short lived , then obtaining the dynamics of @xmath11 on all time scales can be achieved by calculating the kernels at short time only .",
    "in fact , this has been a useful approach to obtain the memory kernel in the nakajima - zwanzig - mori tc approach , as recently illustrated for nonequilibrium impurity models  @xcite and for other condensed phase systems.@xcite      in the nakajima - zwanzig - mori tc approach , one can rewrite the memory kernel in terms of a volterra equation of the second kind , removing the complexity of the projected dynamics of eq .",
    "( [ eq : memory - kernel]):@xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "the super - operator @xmath28 can now be calculated by a variety of numerically exact techniques,@xcite since it does not involve projected dynamics .",
    "a similar approach for the tcl generator seems difficult to derive , since one has to invert the super - operator @xmath29 which spans the entire hilbert space .",
    "indeed , most applications of the tcl approach were based on expanding @xmath30 in a taylor series with the condition that @xmath31 , such that @xmath23 is obtained perturbatively.@xcite    here , we adopt a simple formalism to obtain @xmath23 circumventing the need to invert a super - operator in the full hilbert space by rewriting the tcl generator in terms of system observables only .",
    "the approach is thus , amenable to impurity solvers of the kind used in the tc approach.@xcite we begin by redefining the expression for @xmath11 as  @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the full propagator . for factorized initial conditions , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the propagator of the system ( dot ) only ( @xmath36 ) . by reversing the equation and performing a time derivative on it ,",
    "we obtain  @xcite @xmath37 this equation has the form of the tcl quantum master equation for the reduced density matrix ( eq .  ) where by analogy the tcl generator @xmath23 is given by:@xcite @xmath38 thus , in order to obtain the tcl generator one has to compute @xmath35 as defined in eq .   and also invert @xmath35 . as will become clear below , obtaining the matrix elements of @xmath35 is straightforward and so is the inversion . to see this ,",
    "we rewrite the above equations in a basis set and provide explicit expression for the elements of the reduced propagator in the following subsection .      choosing a basis for the system subspace",
    "as the eigenstates of the system decoupled from the bath , @xmath39 , an operator @xmath40 will be represented by its matrix elements @xmath41 and a super - operators @xmath42 will be represented by the elements of a `` tetradic '' ( specified by four subscripts ) @xmath43 a super - operator is an operator that works on other operators rather than on quantum states and thus , it turns a matrix into a new matrix in the following way : @xmath44 following this definition , it can be shown that the product of two super - operators is given by : @xmath45 therefore , the time evolution of the reduced density matrix elements is given by : @xmath46 the time - local master equation for the reduced density matrix in matrix form reads : @xmath47 and the tcl generator elements are given by : @xmath48 for simplicity , instead of writing operators in the system sub - space as @xmath49 matrices , where @xmath50 is the dimension of the sub - space , and super - operators as tensors of dimensions @xmath51 , we may represent the first by vectors of size @xmath52 and the latter by @xmath53 matrices .",
    "this representation preserves the definitions in eqs . *  * and and simplifies certain operations , such as finding the inverse of @xmath54 .",
    "the exact form of the system propagator matrix elements can be written explicitly in terms of the matrix elements of the full propagator , as derived in appendix  [ apx : tetradic - representation - of - usigma ] .",
    "the derivation is completely general and therefore , also constitutes a proof that such a tetradic representation ( eq .  ) in fact exists .",
    "however , this tetradic form given in the appendix may be difficult to treat .    here",
    ", instead we represent the matrix elements of @xmath35 in terms of the reduced density matrix elements directly .",
    "this is done by propagating the system from different initial conditions of @xmath55 .",
    "for example , if we take @xmath56 , where the subscript @xmath57 denotes one of the many - body states of the system , and the remaining values of @xmath58 then from eq .",
    "[ eq : sigma_ij(t)=00003du_ijkl(t)sigma_kl(0 ) ] it follows that @xmath59 hence , the elements @xmath60 can be obtained directly from the matrix elements of the reduced density operator with the above specified initial condition .",
    "since @xmath61 can be generated using a proper impurity solver at short times,@xcite the tcl kernel can be generated without the need to invert a super - operator in the full hilbert space or use a perturbation expansion to obtain @xmath62 rather , the tcl kernel is generated by inverting @xmath35 in the system subspace only .",
    "this amounts to a computational complexity that is similar to that used to generate the memory kernel in the tc approach.@xcite    similarly , for the elements @xmath63 with @xmath64 , one has to take two different initial conditions for the system .",
    "the first is @xmath56,@xmath65 and the remaining values of @xmath66 and the second only differs in @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are complex numbers ( @xmath70 ) and at least one is not purely real or imaginary . with the above initial conditions",
    ", we find that : + @xmath71 where the superscript @xmath68 or @xmath69 indicates which initial condition is used to generate @xmath11 .",
    "extracting @xmath63 and @xmath72 can now be achieved by solving the above linear equations .",
    "as before , @xmath73 and @xmath74 can be generated at short times from an impurity solver.@xcite",
    "we now turn to demonstrate the approach outlined above to calculate the tcl kernel and compare the time scales governing it with the tc memory formalism for a transport model system .",
    "we focus on the noninteracting resonant level model since the tcl and tc kernels can be obtained in terms of an exact nonequilibrium green s function approach .",
    "however , more complicated models can be treated in the same manner with the approach presented above .",
    "the hamiltonian describing this open quantum system is already given in the format of eq .",
    ", where @xmath75 is the system hamiltonian with fermionic creation / annihilation operators @xmath76 , respectively , and energy @xmath2 .",
    "the bath hamiltonian represents the noninteracting leads : @xmath77 with fermionic creation / annihilation operators @xmath78 , respectively for the left ( @xmath79 ) or right ( @xmath80 ) leads .",
    "the hybridization between the system and the leads is given by @xmath81 with coupling strength @xmath82 and @xmath83 is the band discretization width .",
    "for all applications reported below , we assume a wide band spectral function of the form : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the cutoff length and @xmath86 is the band cutoff energy .    we take a factorized form for the initial condition described by    @xmath87 where @xmath55 will be specified below and @xmath88 with @xmath89 the corresponding normalization , @xmath90 is the inverse temperature , @xmath91 are the left lead and the right lead chemical potentials , respectively , such that the source - drain bias is given by @xmath92 . in the above , @xmath93 .      for the above model ,",
    "the system is spanned by two levels , an empty ( @xmath94 ) and occupied ( @xmath95 ) dot .",
    "thus , the reduced density matrix of the system , @xmath96 , is a @xmath97 matrix and the system propagator @xmath35 is a super - matrix with @xmath98 elements .",
    "for simplicity we will represent @xmath11 with a 4-dimensional vector and @xmath35 as a @xmath99 matrix , as explained in sec .",
    "[ sub : matrix - representation ] .",
    "the diagonal matrix elements and coherences dynamics are independent in the resonant level model , since coherences do not couple different fock spaces .",
    "therefore , the system propagator has a block structure with vanishing off - diagonal block - elements . since we are interested in the populations only , we limit the discussion to the diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix , given by the relevant part of eq .  :",
    "@xmath100 since @xmath101 and thus @xmath102 and @xmath103 , we can express the relevant part of the reduced propagator in terms of two matrix elements alone : @xmath104 from eq .",

    "here , @xmath129 is the fermi dirac distribution of the left / right lead , respectively .",
