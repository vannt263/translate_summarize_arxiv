    "our claim that a reduction in @xmath67 is responsible for this behavior points to a shrinkage of the fermi surface areas ; however , such a feature is indiscernible in the arpes spectra .",
    "@xcite instead , a more plausible scenario is that the @xmath67 decrease is a pretension produced by a phenomenological analysis ; we need to directly deal with @xmath77 in terms of the pseudogap formation @xcite and/or the vertex correction for the current , @xcite both of which are supposed to originate from antiferromagnetic fluctuations .",
    "the decrease of @xmath85 on cooling is most likely relevant to an evolution of the pseudopeak structure observed in the arpes spectra .",
    "@xcite there are two pieces of supporting evidence for this interpretation .",
    "one is that the crossover @xmath15 of the two phenomena is quite similar at @xmath6100 k. another is that both phenomena are related to the increase of @xmath79 : since the density of states is proportional to the quasiparticle mass in two dimensions , the evolution of pseudopeak only in hole bands ( not in electron bands ) hints at the @xmath79 increase ; @xcite we also recall that our analysis connected the @xmath85 decrease with the @xmath79 increase .",
    "one might think that the composition at which the pseudopeak structure was observed @xmath86 is beyond @xmath45 , where the @xmath11 decrease was observed .",
    "however , the @xmath11 increase upon cooling became moderate below @xmath9 k for @xmath87 , hinting that the same phenomenon as observed in @xmath45 happens on the more underdoped side .",

    "we now discuss the underlying microscopic mechanism of the increase of @xmath79 , which consequently leads to the decrease of @xmath85 below @xmath47 .",
    "the simplest interpretation is that holes , coupling with a certain boson centered at @xmath6 12 mev below the fermi energy , formed heavy quasiparticles and acquired quantum coherence below @xmath47 .",
    "@xcite a question to be answered is what the boson is .",
    "a possible candidate is a magnon .",
    "however , the stable coherent state separated from the antiferromagnetic phase ( fig .",
    "1 ) does not match this scenario .",
    "thus , the nature of the coherent state below @xmath47 , as well as its relevance to superconductivity , is unclear at present .    a comparison with other related systems merits a further understanding .",

    "an exceptional case is @xmath91 co , which has a narrow composition range @xmath92 , in which a negative @xmath11 decreases at high @xmath15 and tends to increase at @xmath93 k with decreasing @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite a close inspection of the electron - hole asymmetry will open up a route to identify the boson relevant to the formation of the coherent electronic state .    finally , we briefly comment on the relevance between the crossover phenomenon associated with @xmath21 and @xmath11 ( open triangles and open squares in fig .",
    "1 , respectively ) .",
    "although the two characteristic @xmath15s are quite similar in the composition ranges investigated , we concluded that they have distinguishable origins .",
