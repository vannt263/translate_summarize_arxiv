    "we suggest that a general study of spin - half scattering from a kerr black hole would be a useful addition to the literature , for two reasons .",
    "firstly , unruh @xcite has shown that superradiance does not occur for massless spin - half waves . secondly , though we would expect to see the effects of spin - rotation coupling , the fewer degrees of freedom in the @xmath276 case will make the results easier to interpret .",
