    "praesepe ( m44 = ngc  2632 = the beehive cluster ) and the hyades are often considered as twin open clusters because they appear to have essentially the same age ( @xmath4790 myr ) and metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath40.15 ) .",
    "some authors attribute these similarities to the two clusters having been born within the same molecular cloud or cloud complex ( schwarzschild & hertzsprung 1913 , klein - wassink 1927 ) ; the space motions appear to support this picture ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , eggen 1992 ) . because the hyades is much closer than praesepe ( 44 pc vs.  @xmath4180 pc ; perryman et  al .",
    "1998 , van leeuwen 2007 ) , its stars are much brighter ; the hyades has therefore received much more attention in the published literature .",
    "however , proximity also has its disadvantages .",
    "the hyades is spread out over a very large area on the sky , making it difficult to take advantage of multi - object spectrographs or wide - field cameras to efficiently survey many cluster members at once .",
    "praesepe s four times greater distance can become an advantage in that sense , if a suitable wide - area facility becomes available .",
    "we have taken advantage of one such circumstance , the unexpected availability of the 100 square degree fov kepler space telescope to obtain synoptic photometry of ecliptic plane fields for @xmath475 days .",
    "there have been four prior large surveys to determine rotation periods for low mass stars in praesepe .",
    "scholz et  al .",
    "( 2011 ) reported @xmath450 periods ; delorme et  al .",
    "( 2011 ) used data from the wasp telescope network to monitor @xmath470 members ; kovcs et  al .",
    "( 2014 ) monitored @xmath4400 members with the hat telescope network , and a pair of papers by agueros et  al .",
    "( 2011 ) and douglas et  al .",
    "( 2014 ) used data from the ptf telescope to monitor @xmath4500 members .",
    "those groups reported periods for 49 , 52 , 180 , and 40 praesepe members , respectively ( and a total of 220 unique stars with periods ) , primarily covering stars with spectral types g , k and early m.    the k2 data for praesepe were obtained in 2015 in campaign 5 .",
    "k2 provides precision , sensitivity and long duration , continuous coverage that yields superb light curves ( lcs ) of much greater quality than can be obtained from the ground , and extending to much lower signal amplitudes and masses .",
    "at least three groups have already obtained rotation periods for praesepe members based on these data .",
    "libralato et  al .",
    "( 2016 ) derived rotation periods as a step in searching the light curves for exoplanet transits , but they did not discuss the periods nor the shapes of the phased light curves .",
    "mann et  al .",
    "( 2016 ) similarly derive rotation periods while searching for exoplanet transits ; they illustrate the distribution of rotation period as a function of @xmath6 and color , but do not otherwise discuss the periods or light curve morphology .",
    "finally , our group plotted an early version of the praesepe period distribution in stauffer et  al .",
    "( 2016 ) in the context of comparing the pleiades rotation periods to those in other clusters .",
    "however , no paper has yet published a complete analysis of the k2 praesepe rotational data nor a discussion of the light curve morphologies shown by those stars .",
    "this paper is devoted to those two topics .",
    "much of our current analysis is very similar to that we conducted in the pleiades ( rebull et  al .",
    "2016a , b , stauffer et  al .",
    "2016 ) , and we often make comparisons to the pleiades analysis and results . in section  [ sec : obs ] , we present the observations and data reduction , as well as the range of data from the literature that we assembled , and define the final sample of members that we analyze in the rest of the paper . the overall distribution of k2-derived rotation rates is discussed in section  [ sec : rotationdistrib ] .",
    "section  [ sec : lcpcats ] places these lcs in the same categories as we defined in the pleiades ( rebull et  al .",
    "section  [ sec : singleandmulti ] compares the locations of the single- and multi - period stars in a variety of ways , and section  [ sec : deltap ] looks at the spacings between periods for those stars with clear multiple periods .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "praesepe members and candidate members were observed in k2 campaign 5 , which lasted for 75 d between april and october 2015 .",
    "[ fig : where ] shows the distribution of objects with k2 lcs on the sky ; note the gaps between detectors . all of the stars shown were observed in the long - cadence ( @xmath430 min exposure ) mode .",
    "some of these stars were additionally observed in fast cadence ( @xmath41 min exposure ) , but those data are beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "there are 984 unique k2 long - cadence light curves corresponding to members or candidate members of praesepe ( see sec  [ sec : membership ] below ) .",
    "the tidal radius of praesepe is 12.1 pc ( holland et  al .",
    "2000 ) , which at a distance of 184 pc ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : suppdata ] below ) is @xmath43.8@xmath7 across , which is easily covered by k2 .",
    "( stars that are more than 5@xmath7 away from the cluster center are highlighted in app .",
    "[ app : halo ] . )",
    "kepler pixel sizes are relatively large , @xmath8 , and the 95% encircled energy diameter ranges from 3.1 to 7.5 pixels with a median value of 4.2 pixels . during the k2 portion of the mission , because only two reaction wheels can be used , the whole spacecraft slowly drifts and then repositions regularly every 0.245 d. this drift is @xmath40.1@xmath9 per hour ( cody et  al .",
    "2017 ) .    since these data were reduced at the same time as we reduced our pleiades data ( rebull et  al .",
    "2016a ) , we have the same sets of lcs available to us .",
    "( 1 ) the pre - search data conditioning ( pdc ) version generated by the kepler project and obtained from mast , the mikulski archive for space telescopes . ( 2 )",
    "a version with moving apertures obtained following cody et  al .  in prep .",
    "( 3 ) the version using a semiparametric gaussian process model used by aigrain et  al .",
    "( 2015 , 2016 ) .",
    "( 4 ) the ` self - flat - fielding ' approach used by vanderburg & johnson ( 2014 ) as obtained from mast .",
    "to this , late in the process , we added ( 5 ) the lcs from the everest pipeline ( luger et  al .",
    "2016 ) , which uses pixel level decorrelation .",
    "we removed any data points corresponding to thruster firings and any others with bad data flags set in the corresponding data product .",
    "again , following the same approach as in the pleiades , we inspected lcs from each reduction approach , and we selected the visually ` best ' lc from among the original four lc versions .",
    "since the everest lcs became available late in our analysis process , for the most part , we used the everest lcs to break ties or clarify what the lc was doing .",
    "about 7% had such severe artifacts that no ` best ' lc could be identified ; as for the pleiades , this is often a result of instrumental ( non - astrophysical ) artifacts ( because the star is too bright or too faint or adversely affected by nearby stars , etc . ) .",
    "as for the pleiades , though , the periods we report here are not generally ambiguous , and are detected in all the lc versions ; they just look cosmetically better in one version or another .",
    "our approach of comparing several different lc versions also minimizes the liklihood that any of these lc reductions removes stellar signal .",
    "out of the 984 lcs , only one pair of stars for which a k2 lc was requested were within 4@xmath9 of each other ( within a kepler pixel ) .",
    "these objects are discussed further in app .",
    "[ app : pair ] .      our approach for finding periods was identical to that which we used in the pleiades in rebull et  al .",
    "( 2016a ) . in summary , we used the lomb - scargle ( ls ; scargle 1982 ) approach as implemented by the nasa exoplanet archive periodogram service ( akeson et  al .",
    "we looked for periods between 0.05 and 35 d , with the upper limit being set by roughly half the campaign length .",
    "[ fig : singlefreq ] shows lcs , periodograms , and phased lcs for some praesepe stars with single , unambiguous periods .",
    "as we found in the pleiades , the overwhelming majority of them have zero , or effectively zero , false alarm probability ( fap ) ; a significant fraction have more than one peak with 0 fap ; see section  [ sec : lcpcats ] below .      for stars of the mass range considered here ,",
    "the phased lcs are mostly sinsuoidal and therefore best attributed to star spot - modulated rotation .",
    "we find periods for 828/984 k2 light curves , or 84% of all k2 light curves of candidate or confirmed praesepe members ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : membership ] ) .",
    "there is no significant trend with color ( as a proxy for mass ) for the fraction of periodic stars .    as for the pleiades",
    ", we removed from this distribution any periods that are likely to be eclipsing binaries ( see appendix [ app : binaries ] ) or those whose waveforms did not seem to be rotation periods ( see appendix  [ app : timescales ] ) .",
    "there are a few multi - periodic stars which we suspect to be pulsating variables ( see appendix  [ app : pulsator ] ) ; many of them are also reported in the literature as @xmath10 scuti - type variables .",
    "for some pulsators , the first period is still likely to be similar to the rotation period ( see discussion in rebull et  al .",
    "for the remaining multi - periodic stars ( @xmath425% of the sample ; see  [ sec : lcpcats ] below ) , for the most part , we took the period corresponding to the strongest peak in the periodogram as the rotation period to be used for subsequent analysis .",
    "in a few cases ( e.g. , double dip stars ; see sec .  [ sec : singleandmulti ] ) , a secondary peak is the right @xmath11 to use .",
    "we have chosen four of the most recent surveys looking for rotation rates in praesepe for a detailed comparison of our results ; they are summarized in figure  [ fig : compareliterature ] .",
    "there are 220 praesepe stars in the literature with at least one estimate of @xmath12 ; 60 of those do not have k2 lcs .",
    "scholz et  al .",
    "( 2011 ) used the isaac newton telescope to monitor very low mass members , reporting 49 periods .",
    "we have periods for 40 of the stars in common between the two studies ; the remaining scholz et  al.stars were not monitored ( either because they are too faint for k2 , or because they are in the gaps between chips ) .",
    "the periods derived for these 40 are shown in figure  [ fig : compareliterature ] . there is generally very good agreement ; the median fractional difference ( @xmath13 ) is 2.4% .",
    "there are 8 stars for which their period and ours do not match , and most of them are harmonics , because they are factors of two off ( too small or large ) . in four of these cases ,",
    "the period we derive is very close to 1 day , which is hard to recover with a ground - based telescope .",
    "we believe our periods to be correct in all cases for the epochs in which we observed this cluster .",
    "two stars are of special note .",
    "epic 211951438/hshj396 has a period of 0.593 d in scholz et  al . ,",
    "but we can not recover any period for this star , so we do not retain it as periodic .",
    "epic 211984058/2massj08384128 + 1959471 was not a star for which we initially found a period , because all five light curve versions are different , and it was not clear which lc version is the ` best ' ( see discussion above in  [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "however , upon examination of the k2 thumbnail and poss images of the region , several of the lc versions appear to have been dragged off to a nearby bright star .",
    "the aigrain et  al .",
    "version is the only one that both stays on the target star and has a periodic signal .",
    "the period we derive from this is identical to that from scholz et  al .",

    "has had more time to counteract the contraction in the m3 - 4 stars , and the balance between contraction / spin up and angular momentum loss must be different in the m5 ( and later ) stars .    the existence of a well - defined slow sequence of late f and even early g stars ( blue points in fig .",
    "[ fig : pvmk2e ] ) in praesepe presumably points to their having at least some amount of angular momentum loss .",
    "if they had no angular momentum loss at all , there would be a scatter in rotation reflecting a range in initial angular momentum and a range in disk lifetimes .",
    "however , presumably their angular momentum loss rate is quite small since they have so little outer convective envelope . as a speculation , it is possible that the f dwarfs in praesepe still have rapidly rotating radiative cores , with their observed rotation periods representing a balance between the angular momentum feeding up from below with the angular momentum lost from their winds .",
    "the g / k / m stars have much larger angular momentum loss rates , and have had time to spin down their cores .",
    "so , the two sequences reflect that dichotomy : core / envelope still decoupled for the f dwarfs , core / envelope coupled for the g , k , and early ms .",
    "the bimodal period distribution of m stars in praesepe ( but not the pleiades ) is interesting because field m stars are found to have a bimodal @xmath0 distribution in the kepler field ( _ e.g. _ , mcquillan et  al.2013 , davenport 2016 ) and in nearby m field stars ( _ e.g. _ , newton et  al.2016 , kado - fong et  al .  2016 ) .",
    "these field stars are older , on average , than praesepe , and the locations of the two peaks are slower ( @xmath419 and @xmath433 d ) compared to praesepe with @xmath41 and @xmath417 d for the @xmath4500 praesepe stars with @xmath1@xmath553.79 , the color corresponding to m0 . assuming skumanich evolution , these two peaks can not both evolve together in lock - step .",

    "it may be that the mechanism which causes some m stars to rapidly spin down ( _ e.g. _ , newton et  al.2016 , brown 2014 ) has started to operate in some of the praesepe stars .",
    "we note , of course , that our data can not constrain the behavior of m stars later than about m5 or m6 .",
    "while the relationships delineated by the majority of the praesepe stars in figures  [ fig : pvmk ] and  [ fig : pvmk2e ] are striking , it is worth looking at some of the outliers in this distribution .",
    "notes on specific stars appear in appendix  [ app : pvmkoutliers ] , as well as optical color - magnitude and @xmath0 vs.  @xmath1  diagrams with these objects highlighted .    the g and k stars in young open clusters like the pleiades have bimodal rotational velocity distributions , with a majority of stars on a slowly rotating branch and a minority in a rapidly rotating branch .",
    "the latter stars are generally believed to descend from pre - main - sequence stars that lost their circumstellar disks ( and hence their ability to rapidly shed angular momentum ) very early .",
    "our @xmath0 vs.  color plot also shows several rapidly rotating g / k stars .",

    ", they are best explained as tidally locked short - period binaries . most of them are known short - period binaries ; many of the remaining ones have little to no spectroscopic information , but tidally locked binaries are a logical explanation for stars that are rotating too quickly in comparison to the other stars of similar colors",
    ".    the stars with periods much longer than average for their @xmath1color are also curious .",
    "for a few of them , tidal synchronization ( or pseudo - synchronization ) in a short - period binary may be the explanation , as has been advocated for similar outliers in m35 ( meibom et  al .",
    "2006 ) and other clusters .",
    "because of the steep dependence of the synchronization time on the binary - star separation , for the longer period outliers ( @xmath5620 days ) , this becomes a less viable possibility .",
    "if these stars are all praesepe members , and if we are correct that all of them are rotation periods , then something about these stars made them spin down more than most other stars in the cluster .",
    "for these longest - period stars , interpretation of their lcs as rotation periods is more fraught than other shorter - period stars , as there is more variation from cycle to cycle , and it becomes more of a judgement call as to whether or not the star has a @xmath11 , or just a repeated pattern that may or may not be tied to rotation .",
    "slowly rotating stars may undergo more significant spot evolution , so this may be a real astrophysical effect .",

    "thus , perhaps the higher occurrence rate of shape changers / moving double dips and the lower occurrence rate of resolved close peaks ( for g and k stars ) in praesepe may be attributable to the number of complete cycles available for stars in praesepe ( as compared to the pleiades ) .    for the m stars in the pleiades",

    "the phased light curves of most spotted stars are simple , showing a morphology that is more or less sinusoidal or one that has one or two broad  humps \" or dips .",
    "that is as expected , because spots located at most positions on a stellar surface and when viewed from most vantage points will be visible for half or more of the rotation period .",
    "that means that most spots will have a contribution to the phased light curve that spans 180@xmath7 or more in phase .",
    "flux dips or other structures that cover less than 90@xmath7 in phase are very hard to produce with spots .",
    "the only way they can be produced is by placing the spot very near the upper or lower limb of the star . because of limb darkening and geometric fore - shortening , light from such a location contributes little to the total integrated brightness of the star ; therefore , flux dips from such spots can not yield light curve features that are very deep .    in the pleiades",
    "( rebull et  al.2016b ) , we nevertheless identified six stars with short - duration flux dips ( full width at zero intensity , fwzi , @xmath20.2 in phase ) ; one star had three such dips , another had two , and the remaining four had just one flux dip .",
    "the dips were to first order constant in shape and depth over the duration of the k2 campaign .",
    "all six stars were mid - m dwarfs with very short ( @xmath610.7 day ) periods .",
    "we identified another 19 rapidly rotating , mid - to - late m dwarfs in the 8 myr old upper sco association whose k2 phased light curves seemed to show more structure than could be explained by spots ( stauffer et  al .  2017 ) .",

    "both of these stars are clearly m stars .",
    "there are two obvious , effectively identical periods in each of the ( very similar ) light curves .",
    "the one from the brighter star ( 211934148 ) is about double the counts than the one from the fainter star ( 211934221 ) .",
    "we suspect that each star is contributing one periodic signal . however , it is less clear which period belongs to which star .",
    "the two periods derived from the joint light curves are very different from each other . a period of 2.954 d",
    "is recovered cleanly in both lcs .",
    "the other period , at @xmath423 - 24 d , is less reliably recovered , presumably because there are fewer complete cycles in the k2 campaign .",
    "the longer period derived from the light curves is 23.293 and 24.421 , respectively ( with the slightly longer period originating in the lc with fewer counts ) .",
    "following the same approach as with the rest of the light curves , there is more power in the @xmath423 - 24 d peaks , so that period was assigned as @xmath36 , the likely rotation period for both epic numbers , with the other period assigned to @xmath37 .",
    "however , since these are well - separated peaks , these two lcs were both identified as coming from likely binaries .",
    "given our initial data amalgamations above ( sec .",

    "we obtain @xmath25 magnitudes of 15.05 and 15.53 ; this is at least consistent with the poss images that suggest the two stars are very close in brightness .",
    "this results in @xmath1  of 4.017 and 4.158 .",
    "we looked via vizier to find additional direct measurements of @xmath19 for these stars .",
    "nomad reports @xmath19=16.12 and 17.160 , respectively , which would result in @xmath1=3.898 and 4.542 mag .",

    "if these stars are ` typical ' praesepe members , they should not be outliers .",
    "following the same approach as with the rest of the sample , these stars would both appear within the ensemble , even if both use the @xmath424 d period .",
    "taking the shorter period and tying it to the redder ( fainter ) source , it too is within the distribution at that location , though it is _ just _ above the denser population of m stars .",
    "the shorter period does not appear to be appropriate for the brighter ( bluer ) star ; it is an outlier at that location at any @xmath1 . using the urat @xmath1  estimates results in the most discrepant points ; both stars would be outliers in those cases . using the nomad @xmath19 , the points move slightly right ( redder ) but are still not necessarily ` within the pack ' of the rest of the stars .",
    "we suspect that the gaia - based @xmath1  estimates are the best we are going to have at this time .",
    "we have retained those , and assigned the @xmath424 d period to the bluer star ( epic 211934148/js519 ) and the @xmath43 d period to the redder star ( epic 211934221=ugcsj084307.42 + 191419.2 ) .",
