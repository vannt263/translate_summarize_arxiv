    "on the basis of coupling between an adequate tensor field and scalar field @xmath0 , brans and dike@xcite formulated the scalar - tensor theories of gravitation .",
    "the scalar field @xmath0 has the dimension of @xmath1 therefore @xmath2 plays the role of time varying gravitational constant @xmath3 .",
    "this theory is more consistent with mach s principle and less reliant on the absolute properties of space .",
    "a detail survey of brans - dike theory has been done by singh and rai@xcite .",
    "in fact the notion of time - dependent @xmath3 was first conceived by dirac@xcite , though dirac s arguments were based on cosmological considerations not directly concerned with mach s principle .",
    "+ in brans - dike theory , which is the generalisation of general relativity , an additional scalar field @xmath0 besides the metric tensor @xmath4 and a dimensionless coupling constant @xmath5 were introduced . for large value of coupling constant @xmath5 ( i. e. @xmath6 ) ,",
    "brans - dike theory follows the result of general relativity .",
    "later on , saez and ballester@xcite developed a scalar - tensor theory in which a dimensionless scalar field is coupled with metric .",
    "this coupling use to give a satisfactory description of the weak fields .",
    "this scalar - tensor theory play an important role to solve the missing matter problem and to remove the graceful exit problem in non flat frw cosmologies and inflation era@xcite respectively .",
    "the following authors , singh and agarwal@xcite , reddy et al@xcite , socorro and sabibo@xcite and recently jamil et al@xcite have studied cosmological model within the framework of saez - ballester scalar - tensor theory of gravitation in different physical contexts .",
    "+ among the different cosmological structure of universe , the cosmic string models have wide acceptance because it give rise to density perturbations which lead to formation of galaxies@xcite .",
    "firstly , letelier@xcite described the gravitational effect of massive strings which are formed by geometric strings with particles attached along their extension . at the observational front",
    ", pogasian et al@xcite have showed that the cosmic strings are not responsible for either the cmb fluctuations or the observed clustering of galaxies .",
    "recently yadav et al@xcite and yadav@xcite have studied bianchi - v string cosmological models in general relativity . in this paper , we discuss einstein s field equations in scalar tensor theory of gravitation for bianchi - v space - time , filled with string fluid as source of matter . exact solution of field equations are obtained by applying the law of variation of hubble s parameter , firstly proposed by berman@xcite . this law yield the constant value of dp .",
    "the spatially homogeneous and anisotropic bianchi - v space - time is described by the line element @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the scale factors in different spatial directions and @xmath11 is a constant .",
    "+ we define the average scale factor @xmath12 of bianchi - type v model as @xmath13 the spatial volume is given by @xmath14 therefore , the mean hubble s parameter @xmath15 read as @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the directional hubble s parameters in the direction of @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "an over dot denotes differentiation with respect to cosmic time t. + we define the kinematical quantities such as expansion scalar @xmath23 , shear scalar @xmath24 and anisotropy parameter @xmath25 as follows : @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a matter four velocity vector and @xmath30 here , the projection vector @xmath31 has the form @xmath32 the expansion scalar @xmath23 and shear scalar @xmath24 , in bianchi - v space - time , have the form @xmath33 @xmath34-\\frac{\\theta^{2}}{3}\\ ] ] here , @xmath35 stands for covariant derivative with respect to cosmic time @xmath36 .",
    "we consider homogeneous and anisotropic bianchi - v metric coupled with scalar field @xmath0 .",
    "our model is based on saez - ballester theory of gravitation which is based on coupling of dimensionless scalar field with metric . + we assume the lagrangian @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath5 and @xmath39 represent the scalar curvature , coupling constant and dimensionless arbitrary constant respectively .",
    "+ for the scalar field having the dimensions of @xmath1 , the lagrangian ( [ eq12 ] ) is not physically admissible because two terms of the right hand side of equation ( [ eq12 ] ) have different dimension . however , it is suitable lagrangian in the case of dimensionless scalar field .",
    "+ from the above lagrangian , we can establish the action @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the matter lagrangian , @xmath42 is the determinant of the matrix @xmath4 , @xmath43 are the coordinates and @xmath44 is an arbitrary region of integration .",
    "+ the variational principle @xmath45 leads to the field equations @xmath46 @xmath47 equation ( [ eq14 ] ) is obtained by considering arbitrary independent variations of the metric and scalar field vanishing at the boundary of @xmath44 .",
    "+ since , the action @xmath48 is a scalar , it can easily proved that the equation of motion @xmath49 are consequences of the field equations .",
    "+ the energy momentum tensor for a cloud of massive strings and perfect fluid distribution is taken as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is isotropic pressure ; @xmath52 is the proper energy density for the cloud of strings with particle attached to them ; @xmath53 is the string tension density ; @xmath43 is a unit space - like vector representing the direction of string .",
    "+ choosing @xmath43 parallel to @xmath54 , we have @xmath55 here , the cosmic string has been directed along x - axis .",
    "+ if the particle density of the configuration is denoted by @xmath56 , then @xmath57 the einstein s field equations ( in gravitational units @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) @xmath60 the einstein s field equations ( [ eq19 ] ) for the line - element ( [ eq1 ] ) lead to the following system of equations @xmath61",
    "@xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 the energy conservation equation @xmath67 yields @xmath68",
    "we have a system of six equations ( [ eq20])@xmath69([eq26 ] ) involving seven unknown variables namely , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , in order to solve the field equations completely , we need at least one suitable physical assumption among the unknown variables .",
    "so , we constrain the system of equations with the law of variation for the hubble s parameter proposed by berman@xcite , which yields a constant value of dp .",
    "this law reads as    @xmath73    where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are positive constants . in this paper , we show how the constant dp models with metric ( [ eq1 ] ) behave in the presence of string fluid and dimensionless scalar field @xmath0 . + the deceleration parameter @xmath76 , an important observational quantity , is defined as @xmath77 from equations ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq27 ] ) , we get @xmath78 integration of ( [ eq29 ] ) leads to @xmath79 it is important to note here that for @xmath80 , the model has non singular origin and it evolves with exponential expansion which seems reasonable to project the dynamics of future universe . since we are looking for a model of universe , which describe the dynamics of universe from big bang to present epoch . hence in this paper , the case @xmath80 has been omitted .",
    "+ integrating equation ( [ eq24 ] ) and absorbing the constant of integration in @xmath71 or @xmath72 , without loss of generality , we obtain @xmath81 subtracting equation ( [ eq21 ] ) from equation ( [ eq22 ] ) and taking second integral , we get the following relation @xmath82\\ ] ] where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are constants of integration . + from equations ( [ eq3 ] ) , ( [ eq30 ] ) , ( [ eq31 ] ) and ( [ eq32 ] ) , the metric function can be explicitly written as @xmath85 @xmath86\\ ] ] @xmath87\\ ] ] provided that @xmath88 . + inserting equation ( [ eq4 ] ) into equation ( [ eq25 ] ) and then integrating , we obtain @xmath89 here , @xmath90 is constant of integration .",
    "+ the average s hubble s parameter @xmath15 , isotropic pressure @xmath91 , proper energy density @xmath92 , string tension density @xmath93 and particle energy density @xmath94 are found to be @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99 the above solutions satisfy the energy conservation equation ( [ eq26 ] ) identically , as expected .",
    "+ the spatial volume @xmath100 , expansion scalar @xmath23 and dp ( q ) are given by @xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath103    we observe that at @xmath104 , the spatial volume vanishes while all other parameters diverge .",
    "therefore , the model has a big bang singularity at @xmath104 .",
    "this singularity is point type because the directional scale factors @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 vanish at the initial moment . from equation ( [ eq43 ] ) , it is clear that for @xmath105 , the universe expands with constant rate .",
    "however , the recent observations of sn ia ( perlmutter et al@xcite@xmath69@xcite riess et al@xcite and tonry et al@xcite ) reveal that the present universe is accelerating and value of dp lies somewhere in the range @xmath106 .",
    "it follows that one can choose the value of @xmath75 in the range @xmath107 to have the consistancy of derived model with observations .",
    "+ in the derived model , the scale factors increase with time .",
    "but the contribution of exponential terms to the scale factors @xmath71 and @xmath72 becomes negligible for sufficiently large time i. e. for sufficiently large time we have @xmath108 .",
    "this may be observed from equation ( [ eq33])@xmath69([eq35 ] ) .",
    "thus , initially the growth of scale factors take place at different rates due to effective contribution of exponential terms in @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "but later on the scale factors grow at the same rate . therefore",
    ", in the derived model , the early anisotropic universe becomes isotropic at later times .",
    "+ the scalar function @xmath109 may be obtained as @xmath110^{\\frac{2}{r+2}}\\ ] ] where @xmath111 is the constant of integration .",

    "( [ eq40 ] ) and ( [ eq41 ] ) , it is clear that for @xmath114 and for large value of time , @xmath115 .",
    "this means that the particles dominate the strings at later times which confirms the disappearance of strings in the present day observations .",
    "+ the behaviour of scalar function @xmath109 is depicted in figure 1 . from equation ( [ eq47 ] ) , it is clear that for @xmath114 , the anisotropy parameter @xmath25 vanishes at late time .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath116 versus time is shown in figure 2 .",
    "+        from equation ( [ eq42 ] ) , we obtain @xmath117 according to saha and boyadjiev @xcite , the equation of motion of a single particle with unit mass under force f(v ) can be described as @xmath118}\\ ] ] where @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the classical potential of force f and viewed energy level respectively .",
    "+ from equations ( [ eq48 ] ) and ( [ eq49 ] ) , we obtain @xmath121 in connection , with hubble s parameter the classical potential @xmath122 is given by @xmath123 figure 4 plots the left hand side of energy conditions versus time .",
    "we observe that the weak energy condition ( wec ) and dominant energy condition ( dec ) are satisfied in the derived model .",
    "the null energy condition ( nec ) is violated in the early universe but it is eventually satisfied in the present universe .",
    "it can also be observed that the strong energy condition ( sec ) is violated in the derived model .",
    "the violation of sec gives a reverse gravitation effect which may be possible cause for late time accelerated expansion of universe .",
    "figure 5 plots the classical potential with respect to time in presence of string fluid as source of matter .",
    "we observe that @xmath119 shows positive and negative nature with respect to time .",
    "in this paper , we have studied bianchi - v string cosmological model in scalar - tensor theory of gravitation .",
    "the study reveals that the sting tension density @xmath93 vanishes at present epoch that is why strings disappears from present universe but it was playing a significant role in the expansion of early universe .",
    "the derived model is singular in nature and it has big bang singularity at @xmath104 . thus the universe starts evolving from the infinite big bang singularity at @xmath104 and expands with power law expansion rate .",
    "the spatial volume is zero at initial moment @xmath104 . at this instant ,",
    "the physical parameters @xmath52 , @xmath51 , @xmath53 , @xmath56 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 all assume infinite values .",
    "these parameters are decreasing function of time and ultimately tend to zero for sufficiently large value of time .",
    "the spatial volume tends to zero as @xmath126 .",
    "thus , the universe is essentially an empty space - time for large t. + the age of universe is given by @xmath127 thus the age of universe increases with @xmath106 which shows the consistency of derived model with observations .",
    "+ we have also discussed the classical potential with respect to time and have observed that the classical potential changes its nature with evolution of universe . in early universe , it is found positive and grows with constant rate but at late time , it is ruled with negative value and decreases rapidly with time .",
