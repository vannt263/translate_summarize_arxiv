    "the process of bound - free pair production in heavy - ion collisions at high energies is of interest both from an experimental and a theoretical view point . from an experimental view point , bound - free pair production is of relevance since it is an important contribution to the life time of a heavy - ion beam at high energies , together with single and multiple neutron emission following coulomb excitation due to absorption of one or several photons@xcite .",
    "the bound - free pair process changes the electric charge state of beam particles by one unit , and a secondary beam of different magnetic rigidity is hence emerging from the target position .",
    "this secondary beam is transported by the magnets of the beam system , and will eventually hit the vacuum pipe somewhere downstream . depending on beam species ,",
    "beam energy and beam intensity , the local deposition of energy at the point of impact might do harm to the vacuum and/or magnet infrastructure , and therefore needs to be studied carefully .",
    "the installation of beam collimators at or before the point of impact might be necessary to absorb the energy of this detectors , integrated into the collimators , and capable of identifying the secondary beam particles on an event - by - event basis , would give access to interesting measurements such as single and double bound - free pair production cross sections .",
    "the process of free and bound - free electron pair production is of electromagnetic origin , and is hence in principle calculable within the framework of qed .",
    "the large electric charge of a heavy ion leads , however , to a large electromagnetic coupling at the ion - photon vertex , and the summation of many higher order terms in the perturbation series is needed for getting accurate results .",
    "for example , the single free pair production cross section at born level is modified by substantial coulomb corrections on the order of 14% at lhc energies @xcite . multiple pair processes , for example production of a single free electron pair in conjunction with a bound - free lepton pair , are also subject to unitarity and coulomb corrections .",
