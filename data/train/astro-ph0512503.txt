    "m15 is a well - studied globular cluster .",
    "it has a very steep central luminosity profile , and may be in the post - core - collapse stage ( e.g. , phinney 1993 ; trager , king & djorgovski 1995 ) .",
    "measurements of nearly two thousand line - of - sight velocities ( from the ground and with hst ) and proper motions ( with hst ) have recently become available ( gebhardt et al .",

    "we follow the approach taken by van de ven et al .",

    "this technique provides the internal dynamical structure as well as the inclination of the cluster , an unbiased and accurate dynamical distance , and the @xmath0-profile .",
    "our aim is to derive similar information for m15 .",
    "we are particularly interested in the @xmath0 profile , as significant mass segregation is believed to have occurred in the cluster ( dull et al .",
    "the hst proper motions have sufficient spatial resolution to study the dynamical structure and mass concentration in the center .    in section  [ sec : data ] , we summarize the observational data . in section  [ sec : second - moments ] , we consider the influence of measurement errors on the data , select the stars to be used for the dynamical modeling and also study the possible residual systematic effects in the observed mean motions .",
    "we construct dynamical models in section  [ sec : models ] , derive a distance , and investigate the effect of the unknown inclination and of radial @xmath0 variations in the cluster .",
    "we discuss the dynamics of the central 0.2 parsec of m15 in section  [ sec : spinning - core ] , and summarize our conclusions in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we discuss , in turn , the surface brightness distribution , the line - of - sight velocities , and the proper motion data for m15 .",
    "the surface brightness distribution of m15 has been studied in detail by a number of authors ( lauer et al .",

    "they combined this with the groundbased profile from trager et al.(1995 ) .",
    "the surface - brightness profile is a power - law in the inner arcsecond , with slope @xmath9 , which agrees with the determinations by guhathakurta et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and sosin & king ( 1997).=-2    because the surface - brightness distribution of m15 is only slightly flattened and the individual stars in the cluster are resolved , it is difficult to estimate the ellipticity and the position angle ( pa ) of the major axis .",
    "guhathakurta et al .",
    "( 1996 ) measured an average ellipticity of @xmath10 .",
    "determinations of the pa of the photometric major axis as measured from north through east vary from @xmath11 ( white & shawl 1987 ) to @xmath12 ( from a dss image ) at large radii , and is given as @xmath13 by guhathakurta et al .",
    "gebhardt et al .",
    "( 1997 ) reported the kinematic pa of maximum rotation at @xmath14 north through east .",

    "2002 ; gerssen et al.2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "the expected number of non - members in this data set is very small .",
    "the cluster is very dense , so few interlopers are expected from chance superposition of field stars .",
    "the systemic line - of - sight velocity of m15 is @xmath17  ( g00 ) . with an internal velocity dispersion of about 12  in the center ,",
    "the cluster stars are well - separated in velocity from the foreground galactic disk .",
    "the bulk of the data is inside @xmath18 and the median error of the line - of - sight velocities is 3.5 .",
    "this is a significant fraction of the line - of - sight velocity dispersion , especially at larger radii .",
    "m03 published proper motions for 1764 stars within @xmath6 of the center of m15 , derived from multi - epoch hst / wfpc2 imaging .",
    "the stars range in brightness between 14.0 and 18.3 mag . of the 1764 stars",
    "only 703 stars brighter than @xmath19-magnitude 16.5 where kept and used in their analysis .",
    "we restrict ourselves to this sample of 703 stars .",
    "m03 derived the proper motions in the classical way , by using a reference frame consisting of cluster stars , and then modeling the difference between the positions on the first and second epoch images in terms of a zero point difference , a scale change , a rotation , a tilt , and second - order distortion corrections ( e.g. , vasilevskis et al .  1979 ) .",
    "the corresponding transformation equations were then solved using a least squares routine . as a result , the derived proper motions are not absolute , but may contain a residual global rotation .",
    "they also may be influenced by perspective rotation caused by the space motion of the cluster .",
    "we return to this in section  [ sec : mean - motions ] .",
    "figure 1 of m04 shows the histogram of all proper motions .",
    "the median error of these measurements is 0.12 mas yr@xmath20 , corresponding to about 6  at a distance of 10 kpc , with some errors as large as 0.50 mas yr@xmath20 .",
    "[ sec : mean - motions ]    we use a cartesian coordinate system @xmath21 with @xmath22 along the line of sight and @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the plane of the sky aligned with the cluster such that the @xmath24-axis is the photometric minor and rotation axis of the cluster .",
    "the kinematic measurements then give @xmath25 for the line - of - sight velocities in , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 for the proper motions in .",
    "to convert @xmath26 and @xmath27 into @xmath28 and @xmath29 in , we used @xmath30 and @xmath31 , with @xmath32 the distance in kpc .",
    "the measurement errors in the line - of - sight velocities and in the proper motions need to be taken into account when analyzing the kinematics of m15 .",
    "we do this by means of a maximum likelihood method , which corrects for each individual velocity error , and provides robust estimates of the mean velocities and velocity dispersions in spatial bins on the sky .",
    "the method is described in detail in appendix a of v05 .      figure  [ fig : disp]a shows the velocity dispersion along the line of sight , as a function of radius , for three different selections of stars .",
    "the blue curve is for all stars with velocity error smaller than 14 , the black curve for those with errors smaller than 7 , and the red curve for the stars with errors smaller than 5 .",
    "although we corrected the dispersion for the individual measurement errors , the curves do not all overlap , suggesting that the ( larger ) errors are not estimated very accurately .",
    "the curves converge once we exclude the stars with errors larger than 7 , so we restrict ourselves to this sample of 1546 stars .",
    "the corresponding profile varies between approximately 12  in the center to 3  at about 10@xmath33 ( cf .",

    "figure  [ fig : disp]b shows the velocity dispersions of the proper motions in the @xmath23 and @xmath24 direction , respectively , as a function of radius , for three different selections of stars based on the measurement errors , corresponding to 21 , 14 and 8  for an assumed distance of 10 kpc .",
    "the radial range covered is only @xmath34 , and hence corresponds to the inner data points of figure  [ fig : disp]a .",
    "the profiles for the different error selections are consistent to within the errors of the dispersions .",
    "the dispersion profiles in the two orthogonal directions appear to differ and they are , in fact , inconsistent at the formal one sigma level .",
    "the overall proper motion dispersion is independent of the error selection .",
    "it is therefore not evident that a selection based on measurement error is justified , and we use all 703 proper motions .",

    "the gaussian used for the weighting has the mean distance of the 100 stars as its dispersion .",
    "the resulting smooth kinematic maps correlate the different values at different points , but bring out the main features of the observed kinematics of m15 .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity maps show significant structure , including overall rotation ( g00 ; and section  [ sec : spinning - core ] below ) .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity dispersion shows the radial fall - off illustrated in figure  [ fig : disp]a .",

    "however m03 and baumgardt et al .  ( 2003 ) reported that they can construct n - body models for m15 which do not require an imbh . for a detailed review of the history of this controversial subject ,",

    "this mass estimate agrees with all the earlier estimates of the imbh from gebhardt ( 1997 ) to gerssen et al.(2002 ) . figure  [ fig : chibhcnt ] shows that there is a degeneracy between the central @xmath0 and dark central mass .    to be able to determine the inner structure , accurate information on the central region is critical as it is difficult to determine what happens in the central part that is not covered by luminosity and kinematic data .",
    "the sphere of influence for a 1000 @xmath105 black hole is @xmath108 .",
    "the inner luminosity data point that we used in this model is at @xmath109 from the center and the closest star is @xmath110 and @xmath111 from the center for the line - of - sight and proper motion data set , respectively .",
    "this results in a degeneracy between the central @xmath0 and dark central mass as is shown in figure  [ fig : chibhcnt ] . as a result",
    "we are not able to determine the nature of the matter inside @xmath1121 . by combining the mass of our best - fit mass model and the dark central mass we estimate that the total mass inside @xmath113 arcsec ( 0.05 parsec , @xmath114 au at 10.3 kpc ) is 3400 @xmath105 .",
    "this implies an extremely high central density of 7.4 @xmath115 m@xmath116 .    to test the robustness of this density estimate we made models with a constant @xmath0 ( section [ sec : mlprofile ] ) and a dark central mass . in this case",
    "we found the best - fit dark central mass to be @xmath117 @xmath3 .",
    "the mass contained inside @xmath113 in this model is comparable to that from our models with the best - fit @xmath0 profile .",
    "guhathakurta et al .  (",
    "1996 ) studied the cluster photometry of m15 using star counts .",
    "they detected 205 stars brighter than 20th magnitude in v - band inside @xmath113 .",
    "the typical mass of these post - main - sequence and turnoff stars is 0.75 @xmath105 , thus these stars account for 150 @xmath105 .",
    "their data is not able to constrain the mass of fainter stars .",
    "but they give a rough ( over ) estimate and find that the total stellar mass is 4000 @xmath105 .",
    "when projected onto the sky our mass model gives a total mass of 5000 @xmath105 in this region .",
    "this would mean that there is room for dark mass in the form of an imbh with a mass in de order of 1000 @xmath105 .",
    "if mass segregration has indeed taken place , the stellar mass function used here might significantly overestimate the amount of low mass stars , and therefor lower the total stellar mass .",
    "this would allow for more dark matter inside @xmath113 .",
    "the maps of the velocity fields shown in figure  [ fig : mpmvel ] display significant structure in the inner few arcseconds .",
    "if m15 is rotating , the plot of velocity against position angle for an annulus will show a sinuisoidal variation ( it is exactly sinusoidal for rotation on cylinders ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : rotpmrv ] shows the individual measurements in an annulus with inner and outer radii of @xmath118 and @xmath119 as a function of position angle on the plane of the sky ( cf.figure 14 of g00 ) .",
    "there is little azimuthal variation in @xmath28 , but both @xmath29 and @xmath25 show a sinusoidal variation . using relation ( [ e : dtani ] ) , the line - of - sight velocity and @xmath24 proper motion suggest an inclination of @xmath120 , consistent with our dynamical modeling result . since the proper motions and radial velocites come from different dataset , the concordance of both results and individual significance of the rotation in each component strongly suggest that the central rotation in m15 is real",
    ". a simultaneous fit to the two kinematic data sets , subject to the constraint ( [ e : dtani ] ) , sets the @xmath24-amplitude to @xmath121  and @xmath23-amplitude to @xmath122  , at a pa of @xmath123 .",
    "figure  [ fig : image ] shows the central region of m15 as observed with wfpc2/f336w . we have heavily smoothed the image on the right - hand side in order to measure any potential flattening .",
    "the image does show substantial flattening , which appears in a f555w image as well .",
    "the position angle of the major axis is not at either the kinematic pa nor at the isophotal pa of the major axis at large radius .",
    "we find a position angle of @xmath124 ( north to east ) for the light inside of @xmath125 .",
    "this pa is 30 degrees different from the kinematical pa as defined by the rotation seen in the core .",
    "although this difference is significant given the uncertainty on the kinematically defined pa , the photometrically determined pa is subject to collections of bright stars and it is difficult to determine uncertainties for it . thus , we are unable to determine whether the difference in the kinematic and photometric pa in the central region is significant .    it is tempting to identify this misaligned structure with the signature of an inspiraling binary imbh , as described by mapelli et al .",
    "their simulations of binary imbh predict a small number of stars with high rotational velocities close to the black hole , and then a larger number of stars with aligned angular momentum ( i.e. , central rotation ) .",
    "however , we see no evidence for a small number of associated high velocity stars , which would be a direct signature in their scenario . we do though see ordered rotation .",
    "this rotation is not direct evidence for a binary black hole , but it does suggest an unexpected dynamical state for the central regions in m15 . since the relaxation time is very short in the center of m15 ( around @xmath126 years ) , rotation will be quickly removed by two - body interaction ( akiyama & sugimoto 1989 ; kim , lee & spurzem 2004 ) .",
    "as discussed in gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , it is difficult to maintain such strong rotation in the central parts of m15 .",
    "a binary imbh does increase the central relaxation time ( by lowering the stellar density ) and offers a possible formation mechanism  and even explains the misalignment between the core and halo pa  but one would need stronger evidence in order to invoke such a scenario .",
    "the misaligned core is inconsistent with our assumption of an axisymmetry dynamical model for m15 , with major axis at pa of @xmath14 .",
    "when we ignore the kinematic measurements inside @xmath127 in the fitting procedure , we obtain the same distance and inclination .",
    "we studied the globular cluster m15 by fitting line - of - sight velocities , hst proper motions and surface brightness profiles with orbit - based axisymmetric dynamical models .",
    "the observations used for the modeling consisted of a luminosity profile from noyola & gebhardt ( 2005 ) , 1264 line - of - sight velocity measurements from g00 and a sample of 703 hst proper motions from m03 .",
    "the line - of - sight data extends out to @xmath95 , while the proper motions cover the inner @xmath128 .",
    "the models provide a good fit to the observations and allow us to measure the distance and inclination of the cluster , the orbital structure , and the mass - to - light ratio @xmath0 as a function of radius .",
    "we obtain a best - fit value for the inclination of @xmath129 and a dynamical distance of @xmath87 kpc , in good agreement with the canonical value .",
    "our best - fit model has a @xmath130 @xmath3 dark central mass and the @xmath0 profile shown in figure  [ figmlprof ] , which has a central peak and a minimum at @xmath131 . the overall shape of the profile resembles the shape expected for an expanded core globular cluster ( dull et al .",
    "the central @xmath0 peak and the dark central mass together represent a mass of 3400 @xmath105 inside the inner @xmath113 ( 0.05 parsec at a distance of 10.3 kpc ) .",
    "this suggests that the center harbors a large amount of dark mass",
    ". we can not distinguish the nature of the central mass concentration .",
    "it could be an imbh or it could be large number of compact objects , or it could be a combination .",
    "we found that a heavily smoothed image of m15 shows a flattened structure inside @xmath127 , with a different pa from the outer part of the cluster .",
    "the line - of - sight and proper motion data inside this radius can be fitted using relation ( 1 ) .",
    "the fit gives a pa similar to that of the flattened structure and a rotational velocity of 10 .",
    "this suggests the structure is real , and constitutes a fast - spinning decoupled core at the center of the cluster .",
    "a significant improvement in the accuracy of the dynamical models for m15 is possible by increasing the accuracy of the proper motions and radial velocities .",
