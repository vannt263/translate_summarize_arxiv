    "the spitzer space telescope legacy program `` from molecular cores to planet - forming disks '' ( c2d ; evans et  al .",
    "2003 ) selected five large star - forming clouds for mapping with the infrared array camera ( irac , 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8 @xmath0 m ; fazio et  al .",
    "2004 ) and the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips , 24 , 70 , and 160 @xmath0 m ; rieke et  al .",
    "these clouds were selected to be within 350 pc , to have a substantial mass of molecular gas , and to have a range of cloud properties , thereby allowing studies of star formation in isolation , in groups , and in clusters .",
    "the goals of this aspect of the c2d project ( see evans et  al .",
    "2003 for more information ) include determining the stellar content of the clouds , the distributions of the youngest stars and substellar objects , and the properties of their disks and envelopes .",
    "all of these spitzer cloud studies represent the first unbiased mid - infrared surveys across entire clouds at this sensitivity and spatial resolution , where in the past only targeted , small - field - of - view observations have been possible .",
    "perseus is one of five nearby star forming clouds mapped with irac and mips by c2d , also including chamaeleon ii , lupus i , iii & iv , ophiuchus and serpens ( see evans et  al .",
    "2003 for an overview ) .",
    "previous papers in this series presented irac observations of serpens ( harvey et  al .",
    "2006 ) , perseus ( jrgensen et  al .",
    "2006 , hereafter j06 ) and chamaeleon ii ( porras et  al .",
    "2007 ) and mips observations of chamaeleon ii ( young et  al .",
    "2005 ) and lupus i , iii and iv ( chapman et  al.2007 ) .",
    "the perseus molecular cloud is a source of active star formation with few high - mass stars , none earlier than early b. while nowhere near as chaotic as the orion star forming region , it is also not as quiescent as the taurus molecular cloud , and so provides an `` intermediate '' case study .",
    "ic 348 and ngc 1333 are the two densest and most famous star - forming clusters in this region , containing numerous stars @xmath71 - 2 myr old .",
    "ongoing star formation is certainly occurring throughout the cloud , including in named regions such as l1448 and b5 ; there are deeply embedded class 0 objects found outside the two major clusters ( see , _ e.g. _ , j06 ) .",
    "the perseus cloud is large enough that different parts of it may be at significantly different distances ; see the discussion in enoch et  al .",
    "following that paper , and j06 , we take the distance to perseus to be 250 pc , though we acknowledge that there may indeed be a substantial distance gradient across the cloud , or there might even be multiple pieces located at several different distances .",
    "the perseus cloud is rich in both point sources and complex extended emission .",
    "iras observations revealed more than 200 apparent point sources and complex ism structures , including a large ring thought to be an region , g159.6@xmath218.5 , excited by hd  278942 ( andersson et  al .",
    "ridge et  al.(2006 ) argue that the ring is _ behind _ the main perseus cloud .",
    "hatchell et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) find via a survey at 850 and 450 @xmath0 m  a high degree of point - source clustering and filamentary structures throughout the cloud .",
    "enoch et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) also find strong point - source clustering in their 1.1 mm continuum survey .",
    "the spitzer / irac study of perseus by j06 concluded ( a ) that there are significant numbers of stars being formed outside of the two main clusters ( ic 348 and ngc 1333 ) ; ( b ) the fraction of class i , class ii , and `` flat spectrum '' young stellar objects ( ysos ) differs between the two rich clusters and the extended cloud population ; and ( c ) that deeply embedded class 0 objects are detected , with very red [ 3.6]@xmath2[4.5 ] colors ( but not similarly red [ 5.8]@xmath2[8 ] colors ) .",
    "mips observations at 24 @xmath0 m  ( @xmath8 resolution ) , 70 @xmath0 m  ( @xmath9 resolution ) , and 160 @xmath0m(@xmath10 resolution ) can elucidate many aspects of the ongoing star formation in perseus .",
    "although the emission from stellar photospheres is falling rapidly at 24 @xmath0 m , emission from circumstellar material makes many of the young cluster members still quite bright at 24 @xmath0 m , so mips finds the young stars easily .",
    "emission from the cloud itself becomes increasingly prominent in the mips 24 , 70 , and 160 @xmath0 m  bands , allowing dusty molecular material in the temperature range 120 - 20 k to be probed .",
    "mips reveals complex extended emission throughout the perseus region at all three of its wavelengths .",
    "this paper presents mips data covering more than 10.5 square degrees in perseus .",
    "we also use information obtained from the irac data for perseus from j06 . as a result of observational constraints ( see  [ sec : obs ] below ) the irac data cover only about one - third the area of the mips data ( irac covers 3.86 square degrees ) , so we use the irac data where possible , but large areas of our map have no irac data at all .",
    "the goals of this paper are to present the mips data in a format similar to that found in the other papers in the series , to discuss some of the high - level conclusions drawn from these data , and to highlight some of the interesting objects we have found . because this paper is part of a series , there is synergy with both the papers that have gone before and those to come . because the irac data , where they exist , are usually important for understanding the objects seen in the perseus map , there are extensive references to j06 ; for example , seds for some objects discussed there were deferred to this paper for presentation . similarly , there are references to future work throughout this paper .",
    "one such future paper will present a complete list of yso candidates associated with perseus using the combined irac and mips data , which is beyond the scope of this paper . as part of the c2d ancillary data ,",
    "there has been a paper on the bolocam 1.1 mm continuum survey of perseus ( enoch et  al .",
    "2006 ) and one on the jcmt / scuba sub - mm maps from the complete team as compared to the spitzer data ( jrgensen et  al .",
    "2006b ) .    this paper can be broadly divided into three major parts .",
    "first we give the details of the observations , reductions , and source extraction (  [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "this is followed by a presentation of the ensemble mips results for the entire perseus cloud (  [ sec : pall ] ) . finally , ",
    "[ sec : indobj ] gives a focused discussion of noteworthy stellar aggregates and individual young stars .",

    "the center of this large map is roughly at @xmath12 ( j2000 ) = 3@xmath1337@xmath14 , 31@xmath611@xmath1530 , or galactic coordinates @xmath16=160@xmath6 , @xmath219.5@xmath6 , or ecliptic coordinates ( j2000 ) 59.5@xmath6 , + 11.5@xmath6 .",
    "these observations were part of spitzer program i d 178 ; `` aorkeys '' labeling the datasets in the spitzer archive are given in table  1 .",
    "fast scan maps were obtained at two separate epochs . at each epoch , the spacing between adjacent scan legs was 240@xmath17 .",
    "the second epoch observation was offset 125@xmath17 in the cross - scan direction from the first , to fill in the 70 @xmath0 m  sky coverage which was incomplete at each individual epoch .",
    "furthermore , the second epoch scan was also offset 80@xmath17 from the first along the scan direction , to maximize 160 @xmath0 m map coverage in the combined epoch mosaic .",
    "these mapping parameters resulted in every part of the map being imaged at two epochs at 24 @xmath0 m  and only one epoch at 70 and 160 @xmath0 m , with total integration times of 30 sec , 15 sec , and 3 sec at each point in the map ( respectively ) .",
    "the 160 @xmath0 m  maps have some coverage gaps , and suffer from saturation ( particularly in ngc 1333 and ic 348 ) . figure  [ fig : where ] shows the region of 3-band coverage with mips , and the 4-band coverage with irac . at about 10.5 square degrees ,",
    "the mips observations cover a much larger area than the irac observations , which cover only @xmath34 square degrees .",
    "the three main reasons for this apparent mismatch are entirely instrumental : ( 1 ) we are constrained by the ecliptic latitude to observe with scan legs in a particular orientation ( the maximum rotation is about 10@xmath6 ) , ( 2 ) we are limited in the available choices for scan leg lengths , and ( 3 ) mips covers large areas very efficiently , so we can easily cover large areas with mips in much less time than for irac .",
    "the c2d mips observations were designed for even coverage ( all to the same exposure time depth ) , independent of the gto observations of ic 348 ( lada et  al .",
    "2006 ) and ngc 1333 ( r.gutermuth et  al .  in prep .",
    "the gto observations of these regions are _ not _ included in the discussion here , primarily to enable discussion of a catalog obtained to uniform survey depth .",
    "this is different from the c2d irac observations of perseus discussed in j06 , where the gto observations provided the images for one of the two epochs .",
    "the two observation epochs were separated by 3 to 6 hrs to permit asteroid removal in this relatively low ecliptic latitude ( + 1112@xmath6 ) field . indeed , by comparing the 24 @xmath0 m  maps obtained at the two epochs , at least 100 asteroids are easily visible , ranging in flux density from at least as faint as 0.6 to as bright as 30 mjy .",
    "some asteroids are clearly visible even at 70 @xmath0 m .",
    "the asteroids in this and other c2d cloud maps will be discussed further in k.stapelfeldt et  al .",

    "we started with the ssc - pipeline - produced basic calibrated data ( bcds ) , version s11.4 .",
    "for a description of the pipeline , see gordon et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) . as in chapman et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) , each mips channel was then processed differently and therefore is discussed separately below .",
    "mosaics and source catalogs from these data were delivered back to the ssc for distribution ; see http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/legacy/ for additional information .",
    "multiple deliveries were made ; the data discussed here were part of the 2005 data delivery .",
    "figures  [ fig:24mosaic ] , [ fig:70mosaic ] , and [ fig:160mosaic ] show the individual mosaics by channel , and [ fig:3color ] shows a 3-color image with all three channels included .",

    "[ fig : wherehilite ] , which indicates several objects highlighted for discussion below . )",
    "there is substantial extended emission in all three mips channels throughout the mips maps . in the 70 and 160 @xmath0 m  channels , the mips instrument uses internal stimulator flashes to calibrate the data ( for more information ,",
    "see the spitzer observer s manual , available at the ssc website ) . for most of a scan leg",
    ", the correct calibration can be obtained via an interpolation . on the ends of scan legs ,",
    "it necessarily must use extrapolation solutions .",
    "when the ends of the scan legs run across particularly bright emission , as they do in some cases here ( particularly in the `` ring '' of bright emission ) , the absolute calibration is not as good as it is in darker regions .",
    "fluxes obtained in these regions have larger errors than the rest of the map .",
    "the ic 348 and ngc 1333 regions are encompassed by the overall perseus cloud map dataset . to explore difference between the memership of these two clusters and the more broadly distributed perseus young stellar population , we have chosen to consider the ic 348 and ngc 1333 stellar populations separately from the rest of the cloud",
    "; see figure  [ fig : where ] .",
    "we have defined the regions belonging to the clusters based on the surface density of 24 @xmath0msources .",
    "the region we define to be ic 348 is given by a box bounded by the coordinates @xmath18=55.8@xmath6 to 56.5@xmath6 ( 3.720@xmath19 to 3.767@xmath19 , or 03@xmath1343@xmath1412.0@xmath20 to 03@xmath1346@xmath1400.0@xmath20 ) , @xmath21=31.8@xmath6 to 32.4@xmath6 ( or + 31@xmath648@xmath1500.0@xmath17 to + 32@xmath624@xmath1500.0@xmath17 ) .",
    "this region is larger than what has historically been assumed to encompass the cluster , and large enough ( 0.36 square degrees ) to include the @xmath3300 likely cluster members ( with the new likely members ) found by lada et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) , but not so large that it includes substantial numbers of likely field members .",
    "( note that this box includes most of the new members found by cambresy et  al.2006 , but does not include their farthest southwest part of the cluster . )",
    "the region we define to be ngc 1333 is given by a box bounded by the coordinates @xmath18=52@xmath6 to 52.5@xmath6 ( 3.467@xmath19 to 3.500@xmath19 , or 03@xmath1328@xmath1400.0@xmath20 to 03@xmath1330@xmath1400.0@xmath20 ) , @xmath21=31.1@xmath6 to 31.5@xmath6 ( or + 31@xmath606@xmath1500.0@xmath17 to + 31@xmath630@xmath1500@xmath17 ) ; this region is 0.17 square degrees . in both cases , for ease of comparison ,",
    "these regions are the same as those used in j06 .      as discussed in chapman et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) , standard c2d pipeline processing on the s11 bcds ( 2005 delivery ) was used for mips-24 ( evans et  al .  2005",
    "; see also young et  al .",
    "2005 ) . in summary ,",
    "the c2d reduction starts with the pipeline - produced bcds , and then further processes them to remove artifacts , e.g. , `` jailbars '' near bright sources .",
    "a mosaic was then constructed from the entire data set using the ssc mopex software ( makovoz & marleau 2005 ) ; see figure  [ fig:24mosaic ] .",
    "sources were extracted from the mosaic and bandmerged into the catalog along with 2mass ( skrutskie et  al .",
    "2006 ) @xmath22  and irac-1,2,3,4 measurements . for more details on this process",
    ", please see chapman et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) . the uncertainty on the flux densities derived at 24 @xmath0 m  is estimated to be 15% .",
    "the high - quality catalog we assembled consisted of all detections at mips-24 from the last 2005 delivery where the c2d catalog detection quality flag ( see the 2005 c2d delivery document , available online linked from http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/legacy/ ) was ` a ' or ` b , ' which translates to a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath235 , and where the object was detected at both epochs . while resulting in a shallower survey than would be possible using other combinations of flags , this ensures that no asteroids are included in the catalog .",
    "the extraction pipeline flags some objects as extended ( `` imtype '' flag ) ; no filter was imposed on these extended objects to create the catalog we used , but only 8 of the objects in our catalog are flagged as extended .",
    "there were 3950 total point sources detected at 24 @xmath0 m  meeting our criteria , ranging from 0.603 to 3530 mjy ( comparable to the saturation limit ; see below ) .",
    "the source surface density is about 370 sources per square degree .",
    "the zero point used to convert these flux densities to magnitudes was 7.14 jy , based on the extrapolation from the vega spectrum as published in the mips data handbook .",
    "about 30% of these objects had identifiable 2mass counterparts at @xmath24 .",
    "the faint limit of the catalog of 24 @xmath0 m  sources is a function of the nebular brightness across the field , but what might be less obvious is that the saturation limit for point sources with mips-24 is also a function of location in the cloud because the total flux density registered by the detector is that due to the point source itself plus any surrounding extended nebular emission . because the extended emission at 24 @xmath0 m  varies from @xmath3450 mjy sr@xmath25 in ic 348 to @xmath3100 mjy sr@xmath25 in ngc 1333 to @xmath51 mjy sr@xmath25 in the darker parts of the cloud ,",
    "the completeness of the 24 @xmath0 m  catalog at both the bright and faint limits is a function of location in the cloud .",
    "for example , as will be seen in the source counts discussion (  [ sec : sourcecounts ] ) , there are fewer faint sources in the clusters than in the field , and fewer bright sources in ngc 1333 than in ic 348",
    ". this may indeed be entirely due to the brightness of the background .",
    "an additional issue when considering completeness is the resolution ; the resolution of mips-24 ( @xmath8 , 2.55@xmath17 pixel size ) is poorer than irac or 2mass ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "source multiplicity and confusion may also affect the completeness of the catalog , particularly in dense regions such as the clusters .      to reduce the mips-70 data , we started with the automated pipeline - produced bcds .",
    "the ssc produces two sets of bcds ; one is simply calibrated , and the other has spatial and temporal filters applied that attempt to remove instrumental signatures in an automated fashion .",
    "these filtered bcds do not conserve flux for extended emission , nor for bright point sources , but they do conserve flux for the fainter point sources .",
    "we started with both the filtered and unfiltered s11 bcd products .",
    "then , we mosaicked these individual bcds into one filtered and one unfiltered mosaic using the mopex software .",
    "we resampled the pixels to be 4@xmath17 square ( smaller than the native pixel scale of @xmath27 ) to better enable source extraction .",
    "the unfiltered mosaic is presented in figure  [ fig:70mosaic ] to better show the extended emission .",
    "we defined the point response function ( prf ) from clean and bright point sources selected from this large mosaic , and then using this , performed point source detection and extraction using the apex-1 frame option of mopex .",
    "the initially - produced source list was cleaned for instrumental artifacts via manual inspection of the 70 @xmath0 m  image and comparison to the 24 @xmath0 m  image ; e.g. , if there was some question as to whether a faint object seen at 70 @xmath0 m  was real or an instrumental artifact , and comparison to the 24 @xmath0 m  image revealed a 24 @xmath0 m  source , then the 70 @xmath0 m  object was retained as a real source .",
    "this catalog also has the same limitations as was found at 24 @xmath0 m ; the brightness of the nebulosity drowns out the faintest objects in the clusters , and contributes to saturation of the brightest point - source objects ( particularly in the clusters ) as well . and , the resolution at 70 @xmath0 m  ( @xmath9 ) is coarser than it is at 24 @xmath0m(@xmath8 ) , which complicates source matching to @xmath1  and source extraction in confused regions such as the clusters . for all of these reasons ,",
    "the 70 @xmath0 m  catalog is not necessarily complete and unbiased , particularly in the regions of bright ism and/or the faintest end .",
    "based on a comparison of prf and aperture photometry fluxes , we empirically determined the limit between where prf fitting photometry on the filtered image was more appropriate ( fainter than @xmath28 mjy ) , and where aperture photometry with an aperture radius of 32@xmath17 on the unfiltered image was more appropriate ( brighter than this level ) .",
    "there were 19 objects brighter than @xmath28 mjy , for which we used aperture photometry with a 32@xmath17 aperture and a 17% aperture correction .",
    "the estimated uncertainty on our point source fluxes is 20% .",
    "no color corrections were applied .",
    "sources that were determined by apex to be extended were not fitted , so sources that appear at initial manual inspection to be point - like but are actually resolved in the 70 @xmath0 m  maps do not appear in our catalog .",
    "there were 139 total point sources detected at 70 @xmath0 m , ranging from 64 mjym  flux density of this value would have @xmath1@xmath32.9 mag . ] to 97 jy80 jy .",
    "this value may not necessarily be well - calibrated , as it is indeed quite bright . ] ; the surface density is about 13 sources per square degree .",
    "about 90% of the 70 @xmath0 m  objects had identifiable counterparts at 24 @xmath0 m .",
    "the zero point used to convert the flux densities to magnitudes was 0.775 jy , based on the extrapolation from the vega spectrum as published in the mips data handbook .",
    "for the 160 @xmath0 m  data , we started with the s11.4 ssc bcds . to create the mosaics that appear in the figures in this paper ( such as figure  [ fig:160mosaic ] )",
    ", we used mopex to mosaic the unfiltered bcds and resampled the mosaics to have 8@xmath17 pixels ( half the native pixel scale ) . in order to `` fill in '' the gaps in the map caused by incomplete coverage",
    ", we used a two - dimensional 3@xmath293 ( native ) pixel boxcar median to interpolate across missing ( `` nan '' ) pixels .",
    "no attempt was made to interpolate across saturated regions , nor was any further filtering applied to remove instrumental signatures .    in order to obtain point source flux densities , we started with the unfiltered 160 @xmath0 m  pipeline products and created mosaics with pixels of similar size to the native pixel scale .",
    "photometry was then performed with apex-1-frame prf fitting on this mosaic . because of the complexity of the extended emission in this channel",
    ", apex can be confused .",
    "apex s initial source list was cleaned by hand , and only flux densities from those point sources considered reliable were retained .",
    "not all emission peaks seen on the mosaic were retained ; as for 70 @xmath0 m , only unresolved point sources are included .",
    "similarly , saturated sources , or close multiples , or low signal - to - noise sources , are not included . as with the other mips wavelengths , in regions of",
    "particularly bright ism ( at 160 @xmath0 m , the ism is bright enough that this restriction is no longer limited just to the clusters ) , point sources may be lost due to saturation or ( at the faint end ) to simply being drowned out by the nebulosity . and",
    ", finally , source confusion is a particularly difficult problem here , where the resolution is @xmath10 .",
    "there are 28 total point sources in our catalog detected at 160 @xmath0 m  ( see figure  [ fig : whereall3 ] ) , ranging from 0.67 to 18 jy .",
    "about 60% of the 160 @xmath0 m  objects had identifiable counterparts at 24 and 70 @xmath0 m ; many of the 160-only objects are lacking shorter - wavelength counterparts because the shorter wavelengths are saturated . the zero point used to convert the flux densities to magnitudes was 0.159 jy , based on the extrapolation from the vega spectrum as published in the mips data handbook .",
    "no color corrections were applied , nor was any attempt made to remove the contribution from the blue filter leak . as discussed in the spitzer observer s manual and the mips data handbook ( available on the ssc website ) , stars fainter than @xmath305.5 mag will not produce a detectable leak signal above the confusion level . of the 12 objects detected at both @xmath31 and 160 @xmath0 m , all of them have @xmath31 fainter than 5.5 .",
    "we conclude that the leak is not important for our objects .",
    "we estimate an overall 160 @xmath0 m  flux uncertainty of 20% .",
    "a multi - wavelength mosaic using mips data can be found in figure  [ fig:3color ] .",
    "the extended emission is particularly dramatic and complex when compared across all of the mips wavelengths .",
    "the c2d project mapped this cloud in irac as well ; the irac map ( see j06 ) covers less than half the area covered by mips ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : where ] ) , so there are large parts of the mips map which do not have irac coverage .",
    "the irac source extractions discussed in j06 were bandmerged with the mips sources ( see chapman et  al .",
    "2006 or harvey et  al .",
    "2006 for much more discussion on this multi - wavelength bandmerging process ) and these were included in our catalog .",
    "table  2 presents some statistics on the ensemble catalog spanning @xmath31-band through 160 @xmath0 m . whereas only 37% of the mips-24 objects in the entire catalog have an irac match at some band , 92% of the mips-24 objects _ in the region covered by irac _ have a match in at least one irac band .",
    "there are near - ir @xmath22  data covering this entire region from 2mass , but 2mass is relatively shallow ; only 29% of the mips-24 sources have @xmath1-band counterparts .",

    "vss ix-12 is extremely faint at 70 @xmath0 m ; sao 75942 is a clear detection .",
    "additional followup observations ( such as mir spectroscopy ) will be needed required to determine if these are true debris disks objects .",
    "low luminosity cloud members are particularly interesting objects for study . unfortunately the swire observations show that there is a large population of red background galaxies at @xmath40 14 , and so it is not generally possible to distinguish faint ysos from background galaxies using broad - band photometry alone .",
    "an important exception is the case of the reddest sources ; at @xmath36>$]9.7 , there are no background galaxies with 2mass counterparts .",

    "there are roughly two clumps of objects in perseus ; the fainter clump is reasonably well - matched in color and @xmath1  to the objects found in swire .",
    "there are very few such candidate galaxies in the two clusters because the bright ism cuts off the sensitivity at a shallower level than elsewhere in the cloud .",

    "there are not many objects in perseus that are bare photospheres and also bright enough at 70 @xmath0 m  to be detected by our survey .",
    "we attempted to compare these observed colors with iras measurements of two famous well - known young objects in taurus from kenyon and hartmann ( 1995 ) , even though the iras and mips bandpasses are not well - matched .",

    "this parameter space has not been commonly explored until very recently , in part because the `` famous '' regions of most clusters have bright enough nebulosity ( as we do in our clusters here ) so as to preclude detection at at least one of the three mips bands . in the case of perseus ,",
    "the large area we have covered with our mips map includes many interesting objects in regions beyond the famous clusters .",
    "all of the perseus objects in figure  [ fig:2470160 ] are from the `` rest of the cloud '' where the nebulosity is low enough to enable measurements at all three mips wavelengths ; the colors of these objects , despite being from the `` rest of the cloud , '' are clearly consistent with being young stars .",
    "the locations of these objects are shown in figure  [ fig : whereall3 ] .",
    "only one object is detected at 160 @xmath0 m  within our defined cluster regions ( it is in ngc 1333 ; see fig .",

    "we expected that none of these objects are likely to be extragalactic in that the sensitivity of our 160 @xmath0 m  survey is such that it is really only likely to probe galactic objects , e.g. , cluster members .",
    "however , one object may be extragalactic ; see the discussion in section  [ sec : all3 ] below which discusses each of these objects detected at all three mips bands .",
    "there are several objects detected at the longer mips bands but lacking counterparts at the shorter mips bands",
    ". these could be indicative of very embedded objects , but , because our survey becomes shallower and shallower at longer wavelengths , they are also often objects where the shorter - wavelength counterpart is simply saturated .",
    "there are 18 objects with 70 @xmath0mmeasurements but no 24 @xmath0 m  counterparts ; four of note appear in table  5 .",
    "as can be seen in the table , most of these objects fall into one of two categories : objects that are saturated at 24 @xmath0 m  ( 10 of these , most of which are in ngc 1333 ) , and objects that are faint and/or extended at 24 @xmath0 m  ( 4 objects ) .",
    "the last of these objects , lkha 325 , is relatively isolated and seems to have a 70 @xmath0 m  psf peak slightly offset from the 24 @xmath0 m  peak ; this could be an instrumental effect in that the detection is on the edge of a scan leg , which could affect the centering of the detection .",
    "finally , we looked for objects with 160 @xmath0 m  measurements but no 24 or 70 @xmath0 m  counterparts ; there are 8 such objects , and they appear in table  5 .",

    "two objects are diffuse and the center of their 160 @xmath0 m  emission is clearly offset from the center of a nearby star seen at the shorter wavelengths .",
    "we suspect that the emission in these cases arises in a clump of ism material heated by an adjacent stellar source .      to reject asteroids ,",
    "two 24 @xmath0 m  observations separated by 3 - 6 hrs were made for every position in the mips perseus map .",
    "this dataset provides an opportunity to search for time variability of cloud members and extragalactic background sources on this timescale .",
    "figure  [ fig : timevar ] shows the ratio of flux densities measured at the two epochs , as a function of the combined 24 @xmath0 m  flux density .",
    "the results show an rms difference of @xmath310% between epochs , consistent with our expected measurement uncertainties . below flux densities of 10 mjy ,",
    "the detected signal / noise ratio falls below 10 , and the dispersion between the measurements increases accordingly .",
    "several objects appear as outliers from this general distribution .",
    "investigation of these individually shows that they suffer from one of several defects : they fall on the edges of the map ( where photometry is less reliable ) , are contaminated by artifacts from nearby bright objects ( as in the case of ngc 1333 ) , are confused by bright extended emission , or are extended and thus not measured accurately by our point - source - fitting photometry .",
    "the apparent variability in all these cases is therefore of instrumental origin .",
    "we therefore conclude that none of the @xmath3 4,000 24 @xmath0 m  sources in perseus shows real variability above the 10% level on timescales of 3 - 6 hours .",
    "bright extended emission is present at all three wavelengths throughout the mips perseus mosaics ( figs .",
    "[ fig:24mosaic]-[fig:3color ] ) .",
    "while mips has much more sensitive detectors than iras had , it also samples much smaller pixel / beam sizes .",
    "the result is that in our mips fast scan observations , the achieved surface brightness sensitivity is only incrementally better than that of iras , and the majority of the extended structures we see have direct counterparts in the iras maps . the major value added by the mips observations is a factor of 3 - 5 better spatial resolution , enabling studies of structural detail in the extended emission .",
    "a drawback is that mips saturates on the extended emission in parts of ic 348 and ngc 1333 at 70 and 160 @xmath0 m .    at 24 @xmath0 m  ( fig .  [ fig:24mosaic ] )",

    "to appear so prominently at 160 @xmath0 m  while going largely unseen at 24 and 70 @xmath0 m , these regions must trace cold cloud material .",

    "the extinction follows the 160 @xmath0 m  emission closely , except for the large ring illuminated by hd 278942 . the extended emission around this star , which was so bright at 24 @xmath0 m , is not detected at 160 @xmath0 m .",
    "finally , the 160 @xmath0 m  extended emission also highlights the presence of three large voids on the west side of the perseus cloud complex .",

    "this wide range of circumstellar environments present within a compact ( and presmably related ) group of young stars raises interesting questions about star formation and circumstellar disk evolution .",
    "there are two possible formation scenarios that could account for the diversity of seds in these aggregates .",
    "the first is that every source spends a relatively fixed fraction of its life in each of the class 0 , i , ii , and iii phases of protostellar evolution . in this scenario ,",
    "the observed diversity of seds would require a significant age spread among the members of the aggregates .",
    "the second possibility is that the aggregate members formed at roughly the same time ( i.e. , are coeval ) , and that the process of circumstellar evolution proceeds at very different rates in different objects  such that some members to evolve into class iii sources over the same timescale at which others remain class i objects .    in the first scenario ,",
    "if the aggregate members objects all started with similar initial conditions of mass , angular momentum , and initial cloud temperature ( which is not unreasonable to assume , given their physical proximity ) , then to have both class i objects and class iii objects in the same region requires some stars to be @xmath60 myr old and some to be 1 - 5 myr or possibly as much as 10 myr old , assuming the the canonical ages for objects in these sed classes ( _ e.g. _ , bachiller 1996 ) .",
    "if the class iii objects are not truly associated , leaving us with the class iis , then the oldest ages of objects in these aggregates are @xmath61 myr old , taking the longest disk lifetimes to be between 1 and 5 myr ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , cieza et  al .  2006 ,",
    "rebull et  al .  2004 , and references therein ) .",
    "on the other hand , if all of the objects were formed at very nearly the same time , which is also not unreasonable to assume based on their physical proximity , then there is a real diversity of evolutionary timescales for the various classes . a class i object is often assumed to be much younger than a class iii object , and the timescale for the class i to class iii transition is usually taken to be long compared to the timescale for the transition from class 0 to class i. in order for these clumpings of stars to be the same age , the evolution of circumstellar matter around some objects must be fast , with the timescale to evolve from class 0 to class i comparable to the shortest possible time to evolve from class 0 to class iii .",
    "influences such as the system inclination , local stellar density and interactions between systems , initial disk mass ( _ e.g. _ , beckwith et  al .",
    "1990 ) , mass accretion rate and history ( _ e.g. _ , calvet et  al .",
    "2005 ) , initial core / clump and stellar rotation rate , and/or close binaries could all affect the disk / envelope dissipation timescale",
    ". an obvious follow - on investigation is an assessment of stellar multiplicity in the aggregates  if the class iii objects are preferentially binary , this could explain their more rapid circumstellar evolution .",
    "other authors are beginning to suggest that some stars can lose their disks quickly ( _ e.g. _ , silverstone et  al .",
    "recent work ( _ e.g. _ , mccabe et  al .",
    "2006 , prato et  al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) have found pms binary components in different states of disk evolution ( such as a class ii paired with a class iii ) , and in those cases , the evidence for the stars being exactly the same age is much stronger than the circumstantial evidence for the perseus aggregates .",
    "it is therefore plausible that the aggregate members could be coeval and also display a wide range of disk and envelope properties .    in any case , the observational evidence we present here is that objects of at least class i ( if not younger ) to at least class ii ( if not class iii ) are located within close proximity ( @xmath30.1 pc ) to each other .",
    "additional multi - wavelength follow - up studies of these groupings of stars in perseus ( and elsewhere ) will shed light on the issues raised by this result .",

    "the source luminosity would be comparable to the emission line case .",
    "spectroscopic observations will be needed to distinguish between these two possibilities in the specific case of hh 211 .",
    "the high implied luminosity of the hh 211 bowshocks , the absence of outer flow features beyond the known bowshocks in the wide - field irac maps , and the extremely red driving sources all point toward hh 211 being an extremely young outflow .",

    "a 30 k blackbody is consistent with the observations of ic 348 mms , and corresponds to an upper limit temperature for hh 211 .",

    "the brightest measurable objects in perseus are found in ngc 1333 , where there is a clear excess of these relative to other parts of perseus .    as a result of observational constraints ,",
    "the mips coverage is about 3 times that of the irac coverage . in the region that is covered by irac",
    ", 92% of the mips-24 objects have an irac match at some band .",

    "nonetheless , a third of those have mir excesses , making them potentially cloud members .",
    "many interesting objects throughout this complex have well - defined seds .    by making color - magnitude plots using combinations of @xmath1 , 24 , and 70 @xmath0 m",
    ", we can make an attempt at separating likely ysos from likely galaxies such as those found in swire .",
    "many candidate young objects are found throughout the cloud , not just in the well - known clusters ; in sheer numbers , there are as many young object candidates outside the clusters as in the clusters .",
    "in contrast to j06 , we find a much lower frequency of class i and flat spectrum sources outside the clusters .",
    "the difference can be traced to the selection criteria ; by requiring @xmath1  detections , we are implicitly limiting our selection to the brighter objects , and j06 includes fainter objects .",
    "the mips data show that the abundance of _ bright _ class i and flat spectrum sources is not higher in the rest of the cloud versus the ngc 1333 and ic 348 clusters .",
    "we find that ngc 1333 is on average younger than ic 348 , consistent with expectations .",
    "we find objects that are redder in @xmath1@xmath2[24 ] , @xmath1@xmath2[70 ] , and [ 24]@xmath2[70 ] than any extragalactic source found in swire at these flux levels ; we consider these to be potentially the most embedded young objects , and they are found both in the clusters and in the rest of the cloud .",
    "there are tightly clustered clumps , arcs , and strings of apparently young objects bright at 24 @xmath0 m  located throughout the perseus cloud .",
    "we have presented seds and images of the components of a new aggregate called per 6 and two objects that iras thought were single point sources but that break into pieces when viewed by mips .",
    "each of these groupings of stars has a diversity of seds despite being closely co - located ( within @xmath30.1 pc ) , similar to another aggregate found in the galactic first look survey in l1228 ( padgett et  al .",
    "this suggests that either ( a ) all of the objects started with similar properties but at different times such that there is a real age spread and their circumstellar environments today reflect different stages in a process of uniform evolution , or ( b ) all of the objects are roughly coeval and there is a real diversity of evolutionary states and/or or initial conditions .",
    "if the former is the case , then some stars are @xmath60 myr old and some are @xmath80 myr old",
    ". if the latter is the case , the evolution of circumstellar matter must be such that the timescale to evolve from class 0 to class i is comparable to the shortest possible time to evolve from class 0 to class iii , and it is perhaps strongly influenced by conditions specific to each star .",
    "there is no real variability of any of the 24 @xmath0 m  sources in our field on timescales of @xmath36 hours to @xmath310% .",
    "we used the mips data to assess how well the iras survey did in identifying point sources in a region where complex extended emission is present , posing a significant source of confusion to the large aperture iras measurements .",
    "most of the 12 and 25 @xmath0 m  highest - quality iras psc point sources are either retrieved or it is clear why a point source was reported for that location .",
    "there are many more psc `` point sources '' reported at 60 and 100 @xmath0 m  ( than at 12 and 25 @xmath0 m ) ; a much lower fraction of these objects are recovered .",
    "the iras fsc is much more robust for studies of stellar sources in regions with complex extended emission , and should be used in preference to the iras psc unless mips data are available .",
    "the 16 objects detected at all three mips bands throughout the cloud are expected to be among the most interesting cloud members ; they all have colors consistent with embedded young objects , though one on the edge of the field is likely to be a background galaxy ( based on poss observations ) .",
    "we suggest that at least one of these objects may be a new class 0 object .",
    "two debris disk candidates , hd 281159 ( bd+31@xmath6643 in ic 348 ) and hd 278942 , are found not to have infrared excess ; iras measurements suggesting an excess were contaminated by bright extended emission .",
