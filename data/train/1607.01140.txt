    "<S> some physical objects are not accessible to direct experimentation . an environment of an open quantum system being a paradigmatic example . </S>",
    "<S> it is then desirable to infer the properties of these objects based solely on their interactions with systems over which we have control . in this spirit , here we propose a method for assessing non - classicality of the environment from the gain of quantum entanglement between two systems individually interacting with the environment but not with each other . </S>",
    "<S> the framework is general and in principle allows detection of non - classical features of any inaccessible object able to mediate entanglement .    </S>",
    "<S> positions and momenta of classical particles determine their state . </S>",
    "<S> since no limitation on the precision of position and momentum measurement is imposed by the classical laws , all accessible classical states are in principle distinguishable . on the contrary , there exists no measurement able to distinguish quantum states represented by non - orthogonal hilbert space vectors . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore declare an object as non - classical if its description within quantum formalism requires such non - orthogonal states . </S>",
    "<S> quantum correlations necessitate this form of non - classicality of certain subsystems , i.e. some quantum states of the multipartite system are impossible to represent with only orthogonal states for the subsystem .    </S>",
    "<S> this idea is explicitly present in the definition of quantum discord , which asserts that objects share quantum correlations if there is no von neumann measurement on a subsystem that keeps the total state unchanged  @xcite . indeed </S>",
    "<S> , this only happens when the total state is not so - called quantum - classical , meaning that some non - orthogonal states must be used to represent the subsystem . </S>",
    "<S> our aim here is to reveal the non - classicality of a subsystem , equivalently the presence of quantum discord between this subsystem and others , without actually accessing it .    </S>",
    "<S> consider the three - body scenario depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_abc ] . as a motivation for our study </S>",
    "<S> let the inaccessible object @xmath0 be the environment of the open quantum system @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> a vast body of literature exists on the initial system - environment correlations stressing their influence on the evolution of the open system  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the significant role of the initial correlations resulted in various proposals for their detection by monitoring the dynamics of distinguishability @xcite or purity @xcite of the whole accessible system . </S>",
    "<S> these schemes have been implemented experimentally by means of quantum tomography @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our scheme can also be used to detect system - environment correlations with the advantage that state tomography is not necessary . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by dividing the open system into @xmath2 and @xmath3 parts and monitoring presence of entanglement , which can be realised with entanglement witnesses  @xcite .     and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 individually interact with a mediator object @xmath0 , but not with each other , i.e. the interaction hamiltonian is @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> it is assumed that @xmath0 is inaccessible , i.e. no measurement can be conducted on it and its state can not be controlled . </S>",
    "<S> we show conditions under which the gain of quantum entanglement in @xmath1 implies non - classicality of @xmath0.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    furthermore , the non - classicality of the initial correlations was linked to the impossibility of describing dynamics of the open system with completely positive maps  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence detection schemes of quantum discord in the initial system - environment state have been proposed  @xcite and recently assessed experimentally @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasise that these schemes detect the non - classicality of the principal system , whereas our schemes ascertain the non - classicality of the environment . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is usually assumed to be inaccessible directly .    </S>",
    "<S> our method is developed in the context of entanglement distribution with continuos interactions  @xcite , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_abc ] . </S>",
    "<S> we first focus on the partition @xmath5 and demonstrate a crucial result which will be instrumental to design our criterion for the inference of non - classicality of @xmath0 based on entanglement dynamics in @xmath1 only . </S>",
    "<S> previous studies on the resources allowing for entanglement distribution showed that any three - body density matrix , i.e. at any moment of time @xmath6 in the present context , satisfies the following inequality  @xcite : @xmath7 is the relative entropy of entanglement in the partition @xmath8  @xcite , and @xmath9 is the relative entropy of discord  @xcite also known as the one - way quantum deficit  @xcite . note that relative entropy of discord is in general not symmetric , i.e. @xmath10 . inequality ( [ ebound ] ) shows that the change in entanglement due to relocation of particle @xmath0 is bounded by the non - classical correlations in the form of discord carried by @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider the situation where particles @xmath2 and @xmath3 individually interact with @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> however , they are not in direct interaction between them . </S>",
    "<S> we call @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) the interaction hamiltonian between the mediator @xmath0 and particle @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we assume first that @xmath13 = 0 $ ] , and hence the evolution operator from the initial time , @xmath14 , to some finite time , @xmath15 , is just @xmath16 , with @xmath17 , where we set @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is mathematically equivalent to first interacting @xmath0 with @xmath2 and then @xmath0 with @xmath3 ( or in reversed order ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , note that the density matrix @xmath19 , obtained by `` evolving '' the initial state by only one unitary , does not describe the state of the system at time @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> such states are obtained by application of the whole evolution @xmath20 for suitable duration . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we now show that the properties of the instrumental state @xmath21 are relevant to entanglement gain .    </S>",
    "<S> consider the following forms of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ebound ] ) written for the initial state @xmath22 and the instrumental state @xmath21 , respectively @xmath23 note that @xmath24 , because interaction @xmath25 is local in this partition . </S>",
    "<S> the state at time @xmath15 is given by @xmath26 and thus @xmath27 , this time due to interaction @xmath28 being local . summing the above inequalities we obtain the following bound on the entanglement gain @xmath29 this opens up a possibility of creating entanglement at time @xmath15 without producing discord at time @xmath15 and without initial discord , but rather by utilising non - classicality in the instrumental state . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , entanglement gain in partition @xmath5 could be mediated by object @xmath0 which gets non - classically correlated by evolution @xmath25 and then decorrelated by @xmath28 , so that object @xmath0 is only classically correlated at times @xmath14 and @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> we now give a concrete example of this type of entanglement creation .    </S>",
    "<S> consider the interaction hamiltonian : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the pauli @xmath32 matrix . </S>",
    "<S> as initial state we choose the classically correlated state @xmath33 where e.g. @xmath34 is the eigenstate of the pauli @xmath35 matrix with eigenvalue @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> one can now readily check that the relative entropy of entanglement @xmath37 grows from @xmath38 to @xmath39 in the timespan from @xmath14 to @xmath40 , whereas discord @xmath41 remains zero at these two times . </S>",
    "<S> the gain is indeed due to non - classical correlations of the instrumental state : applying only @xmath25 for a time @xmath15 produces discord @xmath42 .    for general hamiltonians @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which do not commute </S>",
    "<S> , one can pursue a similar analysis with the help of trotter expansion . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution operator @xmath20 is now discretised into successive short time interactions of @xmath0 with @xmath2 and @xmath0 with @xmath3 ( or in reversed order ) @xmath43 where @xmath44 . accordingly , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ebound_finite ] ) holds with @xmath15 replaced by @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> it is now natural to ask if a scenario exists where entanglement could be increased via interactions with classical object @xmath0 _ at all times _ by exploiting the discord in the instrumental state . </S>",
    "<S> the example given below eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ xhamiltonian ] ) is not of this sort because , although quantum discord @xmath41 is zero initially and at time @xmath15 , it is non - zero for @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that for short evolution times the discord of the instrumental state can not be exploited as the following theorem demonstrates .    for a three party system with hamiltonian @xmath4 , entanglement </S>",
    "<S> @xmath37 is constant if discord @xmath47 at all times .    </S>",
    "<S> while the formal proof of this statement is presented in appendix  [ app_proof ] , a good intuition of the lines of thought that lead to it comes from considering only terms up to order @xmath45 in the evolution .    </S>",
    "<S> this theorem extends the result of no entanglement gain via local operations and classical communication ( locc )  @xcite to the case of continuous interactions . in general , zero - discord states are natural models for classical communication as they allow for continuous projective measurement on @xmath0 that does not disturb the whole multiparty state , and therefore make entanglement gain impossible .    </S>",
    "<S> we are now in a position to study the non - classicality of @xmath0 from observing @xmath1 only . </S>",
    "<S> due to the theorem above , a promising candidate observable is the entanglement gain . </S>",
    "<S> however , we now show that some knowledge of the initial state of the whole tripartite system needs to be supplied .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider again eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ xhamiltonian ] ) and choose the initial state @xmath48 where @xmath49 are the eigenstates of the pauli @xmath32 operator with eigenvalues @xmath50 , and @xmath51 and @xmath52 are two orthogonal bell states . as the initial state in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq_cl_ex ] ) contains the eigenstates of @xmath53 , the system remains classical , as measured on @xmath0 , at all times . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the classical basis is the same at all times . yet , as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_g2 ] , the entanglement in partition @xmath54 grows . </S>",
    "<S> one can verify that the oscillating relative entropy of entanglement in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_g2 ] is given by @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the von neumann entropy of the @xmath1 state at time @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , in general entanglement gain in partition @xmath54 does _ not _ signify the non - classicality of @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> , it oscillates in the @xmath54 subsystem showing that interactions with classical object can localise entanglement.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    similar considerations have been presented in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite as a counterexample to the impossibility of entanglement gain via locc . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_g2 ] there is entanglement in the system already from the beginning , in the partition @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> subsequent evolution only localises it to the subsystem @xmath1  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this example emphasises that the ancillary particles within the framework of locc are not allowed to be initially correlated with the principal system , even if these correlations are classical .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the only way of gaining entanglement in system @xmath1 is to localise it from the already present entanglement in @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a consequence of our theorem and reinforces its role as a proper generalisation of the monotonicity of entanglement to continuous interactions . in general , for any state , we have @xmath57 . however , </S>",
    "<S> if initially both entanglements are equal , i.e. @xmath58 , then our theorem implies no entanglement gain since @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> if we can therefore ensure that the initial entanglements coincide , i.e. @xmath58 , then entanglement gain in system @xmath1 is only possible due to non - classicality of object @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss ways of ensuring that the initial entanglements coincide by operating only on system @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> an obvious way is to prepare @xmath1 in a pure state , as this implies that @xmath1 is completely uncorrelated with @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , due to the assumed classicality of @xmath0 , the whole tripartite state is of the form @xmath60 , and the condition of equal initial entanglements reads  @xcite : @xmath61 where @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> since we are interested in observing entanglement gain , it is natural to start with as small entanglement as possible . </S>",
    "<S> this leads us to propose the application of an entanglement - breaking channel to one of the available systems , at time @xmath14 . indeed , after application of the channel both sides of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq_ave_e ] ) are equal to zero . in a more concrete example illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_p2 ] , the channel is a von neumann measurement . </S>",
    "<S> arbitrary measurement is allowed and experimentalist should choose the one having potential for biggest entanglement gain . </S>",
    "<S> note that the measurement results need not be known .    . </S>",
    "<S> the protocol makes no assumptions about the initial tripartite state and has the following steps : ( i ) von neumann measurement in subsystem @xmath2 ( or any entanglement - breaking channel ) ; ( ii ) evolution of the whole @xmath63 systems ; ( iii ) entanglement estimation of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we show in the main text that nonzero entanglement reveals non - classicality of subsystem @xmath0.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    if one is only interested in the detection of correlations between @xmath1 and @xmath0 , and not in ascertaining whether they are classical or non - classical , then the entanglement - breaking channel can be omitted . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , for initially uncorrelated states @xmath64 the initial entanglements coincide @xmath65 , and hence no entanglement gain in @xmath1 is possible via classical @xmath0 . therefore , if one observes the gain then either @xmath66 or @xmath67 at some time . </S>",
    "<S> in both cases there are correlations between @xmath1 and @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> condition of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq_ave_e ] ) may not be easy to fulfil in some experiments . </S>",
    "<S> for example , preparation of pure states is impossible in inevitably noisy laboratories . in such cases </S>",
    "<S> , the theorem above implies that if system @xmath0 is classical at all times then @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> one can bound the initial entanglement here with accessible quantities . </S>",
    "<S> we present a bound where the purity of subsystems is characterised by the von neumann entropy . </S>",
    "<S> relative entropy of entanglement is upper bounded by the mutual information @xmath69  @xcite . from the sub - additivity of entropy for @xmath70 subsystem we have @xmath71 , and </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath0 is assumed classical , @xmath72 , we arrive at the bound @xmath73 violation of this inequality reveals non - classicality of @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have introduced a method that allows for detection of non - classicality of unmeasured object @xmath0 , equivalently the detection of non - classical correlations between @xmath1 and @xmath0 as measured by relative entropy of discord @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned in the introduction , other methods of detection of the system - environment correlations and their properties were developed in the context of open quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we would like to compare our approach with the method of gressner _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which also focuses on the non - classicality : ( i ) our method of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_p2 ] does not require state tomography , since there always exists an entanglement witness able to detect the presence of entanglement  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is practically important as tomography is a complex task for systems with high dimensions ; ( ii ) the scheme of @xcite requires measurements in the eigenbasis of the principal system . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_p2 ] is arbitrary and can even be replaced by an entanglement - breaking channel ; ( iii ) previous methods detect non - classical correlations between system and environment as measured on the system , i.e. presence of quantum discord @xmath74 . on the contrary , our method allows to infer the presence of non - classical correlations @xmath41 , from observations of the principal system only ; ( iv ) the method of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite detects non - classical correlations in the initial state . </S>",
    "<S> our method reveals whether non - classical correlations are formed at any time between the state preparation and the measurement of entanglement ; ( v ) other methods use very different quantities for detection of correlations and their non - classicality . to our knowledge , </S>",
    "<S> entanglement gain is for the first time employed for detection of non - classicality of the environment .    finally , we would like to briefly highlight the generality of the framework introduced here . </S>",
    "<S> our results are aimed at the detection of the non - classicality of objects that we can not directly measure , through measurements on the systems with which they are interacting . moreover , the analysis presented herein does not depend on the dimension of the hilbert space of any of the subsystems , and can thus be applied in an equally successful way to continuous - variable systems . </S>",
    "<S> this makes our strategy for the revelation of non - classicality very appealing for experimental contexts such as cavity optomechanics . </S>",
    "<S> the goal , in that situation , would be the inference of non - classicality of the state of a massive mechanical system embodied by a membrane suspended at the centre of a two - sided optical cavity  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the direct access to such system is typically prevented by the necessity of not disturbing its fragile non - classical states . by driving the cavity with a laser field from both its input mirrors , respectively </S>",
    "<S> , we would realize a situation completely analogous to that in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_abc ] with both @xmath2 and @xmath3 embodied by the two fields of the cavity , and the role of @xmath0 played by the mechanical membrane .    in a more visionary perspective </S>",
    "<S> , system @xmath0 could be a gravitational field interacting with masses @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which are mutually non - interacting and isolated as much as possible from their respective environment , so as to make decoherence negligible . by determining experimentally the entanglement gain between @xmath2 and @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> one would conclude , according to our scheme , the non - classical nature of the gravitational field between them . </S>",
    "<S> that is , if we were to embed into the quantum formalism description of the masses and the field , there would have to be non - orthogonal states in the hilbert space describing the field .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> _ we have proposed an entanglement - based criterion for the inference of non - classicality of an inaccessible system . </S>",
    "<S> our protocol is fully non - disruptive of the state of the system to probe , and relies on only weak assumptions on the nature of the interactions involved in the inference process itself . </S>",
    "<S> this feature makes our proposal suitable to address non - classicality at many levels , from experimentally relevant technological platforms such as quantum optomechanics , to fundamental problems on the nature of gravity . </S>"
