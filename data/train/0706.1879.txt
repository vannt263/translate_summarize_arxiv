    "the main subject of this paper is to solve the analogous problem for total foliations .",

    "it implies that there exists an obstruction to deform a total plane field into a total foliation _ if we fix one of the plane fields as a given foliation_.    mitsumatsu ( * ? ? ?",
    "* problem 5.2.7 ) , asked which homotopy classes of plane fields can be realized as a transverse pair of codimension - one foliations .",
    "his question is important from the viewpoint of bi - contact structures , which we consider in the next paragraph .",
    "the theory of characteristic classes tells that a plane field is contained in a total plane field if and only if its euler class vanishes .",

    "[ cor : total ] an oriented plane field on an oriented closed three - dimensional manifold is homotopic to a foliation which is contained in a total foliation if and only if its euler class vanish .",
    "we call a pair of mutually transverse positive and negative contact structures _ a bi - contact structure_. mitsumatsu @xcite , and eliashberg and thurston @xcite showed that bi - contact structures naturally correspond to _ a projectively anosov flow _",

    "related to the question above , mitsumatsu asked which homotopy class of plane field can be realized by contact structures in a bi - contact structure . in (",
    "* theorem 2.4.1 ) , eliashberg and thurston showed that any foliation except the product foliation @xmath5 on @xmath6 can be @xmath7-approximated by positive or negative contact structure .",
    "it is easy to see that any mutually transverse plane fields are homotopic to each other and that the product foliation on @xmath6 does not admit a transverse foliation .",
    "hence , the following is an immediate consequence of eliashberg - thurston s theorem and corollary  [ cor : total ] .",

    "the answer for tight contact structures is still unknown .",
    "proof of theorem [ thm : total ] is obtained after performing a sequence of surgeries and gluings along so - called _ @xmath11-components _ , which are solid tori equipped with a ` simple ' total foliation .    section  [ chap : formula ] is devoted to the study of the effect of a surgery on the homotopy class of a total foliation . in subsection",
    "[ sec : spin ] , we review two invariants of total plane fields that determine its homotopy class completely  _ the spin structure _ and _ the difference of hopf degree_. in subsection  [ sec : reeb ] , we define @xmath11-components of total foliations and gluing of two total foliations along the boundaries of @xmath11-components . in subsections  [",
    "sec : surgery ] and  [ sec : gluing ] , we define a surgery of a total foliation along an @xmath11-component and give a surgery formula .    section [ chap : construction ] is the main part of our construction of a total foliation in any given homotopy class .",
    "it is done by a modification of hardorp s construction in @xcite .",
    "the main new feature in our construction is a control of the framing of @xmath11 components by insertion of ` plugs ' ( lemma [ lemma : framing change ] ) .",
    "insertion of plugs of another type also enables us to control the difference of hopf degree ( lemma [ lemma : change hopf ] ) . in order to obtain such plugs ,",
    "we need to construct total foliations on the three - dimensional sphere @xmath12 such that the cores of @xmath11-components form special framed links .",
    "hardorp s construction is insufficient to our purpose since the framing is a very large positive number and it is difficult to control . in the first step of our construction , there are two differences from his construction :    1 .",
    "our construction is performed on a non - trivial @xmath13-bundle over the circle while hardorp s was on @xmath14 ; 2 .",
    "foliations in our @xmath11-components may rotate several times in some sense while they did not in hardorp s .",
    "these differences leads to a simpler construction in the succeeding steps : we can avoid dealing with a finite covering of a total foliation on the poincar sphere and with a branched double covering along the unknot . as a consequence",
    ", we can obtain an explicit description of the framings of @xmath11-components in terms of diagrams of braids , see proposition [ prop : any braid ] .    in subsection",
    "[ sec : w ] , we give a construction of total foliations on @xmath15 $ ] . in subsection",

    "[ sec : hardorp ] , we control the framings of @xmath11-components and show a generalized version of hardorp s theorem , _",
    "i.e. _ , the existence of a total foliation with any given spin structure",

    "[ sec : proof ] , we give a control of the hopf degree .",
    "in fact , we construct a total foliation on @xmath12 that admits unknotted @xmath11-components with @xmath16- and @xmath17-framings and that has the required difference of hopf degree with the positive total reeb foliation . by gluing it with a total foliation that has the required spin structure",
    ", we obtain a total foliation in any given homotopy class of total plane fields .    section [ chap : contact ] is devoted to the proof of corollary [ cor : bi - contact ] .",
    "we show that if a total foliation admits an unknotted @xmath11-component with @xmath16-framing then any positive contact structure that is sufficiently close to one of the foliations violates the thurston - bennequin inequality and therefore is overtwisted .",
    "once it is shown , the corollary is an easy consequence of eliashberg s classification of overtwisted contact structures in @xcite .",
    "this paper was prepared while the first and third authors stayed at unit de mathmatiques pures et appliques , cole normale suprieure de lyon and it started when the second author was at institut fourier , grenoble .",
    "they thank the members of those institutions , especially professor tienne ghys for his warm hospitality .",
    "the authors are also grateful to an anonymous referee for many suggestions to improve the readability of the paper .",
