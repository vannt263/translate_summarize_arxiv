    "molecular electronics  @xcite has provided means to study the dynamics of open quantum systems , in which one considers a small , strongly interacting and highly correlated region ( the molecule and its closest vicinity ) coupled to several large , noninteracting baths ( representing the fermionic leads and environment ) . while the equilibrium nature of quantum dynamics in condensed phases has been mostly resolved,@xcite the intrinsic nonequilibrium nature of transport through molecular junctions , along with the necessity to treat fermionic degrees of freedom ,",
    "poses a much greater theoretical challenge , and thus remains poorly understood .",
    "several different paths have been taken to improve the standard landauer - bttiker approach  @xcite and its generalization to the multichannel case,@xcite in order to account for electron - electron and electron - phonon correlations in molecular junctions .",
    "the different approaches can be classified as perturbative treatments , among which the most notable examples use the nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) formalism,@xcite and numerically exact techniques , perhaps the most prominent of which have been time - dependent numerical renormalization group techniques  @xcite and the promising diagrammatic approaches based on path integral formulations.@xcite    these approaches have been applied to a variety of physically interesting problems including the description of coulomb and franck - condon blockade,@xcite the nonequilibrium kondo problem,@xcite and inelastic electron tunneling.@xcite while successful to a large extent , these approaches suffer from several limitations , including difficulties that arise in the treatment of more complex environments or when inelastic scattering is governed by interactions of electrons with soft modes that are dominated by large anharmonicities .",
    "parallel to these developments , a completely different paradigm has been devised based on semiclassical approaches .",
    "these have provided a useful tool to simulate the dynamics of molecular subsystems coupled to a fluctuating environment with significant anharmonicities .",
    "the most appealing semiclassical treatments have relied on the mixed quantum - classical approach  @xcite and on the semiclassical initial value representation.@xcite the latter have been applied to a variety of physically interesting condensed phase problems with remarkable success.@xcite it is interesting to note that such approaches have not received any attention in the context of nonequilibrium quantum transport , despite being exact in the harmonic boson case.@xcite    a major goal of the present work is to show how a semiclassical ( sc ) approach can treat the dynamics of a many - body quantum system driven away from equilibrium by the application of a bias voltage .",
    "we describe the transport problem in second quantization , partitioning the space into an interacting region describing the molecule and its closest vicinity and a noninteracting region representing the leads and the environment .",
    "the approach is based on an sc model for the general second - quantized many - electron hamiltonian by miller and white ( mw),@xcite which followed earlier work of mccurdy , meyer , and miller ( mmm )  @xcite on constructing classical models for electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "the essence of mw s model is that each fermionic degree of freedom ( i.e. , each pair of one - particle annihilation / creation operators ) is described by a classical degree of freedom ( pair of action - angle variables ) , while in mmm s earlier work each electronic _ state _ is described by a classical degree of freedom .",
    "mw s model is thus a more `` microscopic '' description of the electronic degrees of freedom , and more importantly much more `` efficient '' ( i.e. , involving many fewer classical degrees of freedom ) for many electron systems ( where the number of electronic states can be much larger than the number of one - particle annihilation / creation operators ) .    to assess the accuracy of the proposed approach , we focus on the resonant level model and",
    "derive working expressions to simulate the left , right and total current using classical trajectories with quasi - classical initial conditions .",
    "remarkably excellent agreement in comparison to exact results is achieved for a wide range of bias and gate voltages and for different temperatures .",
    "our approach provides a natural framework to study more complex molecular transport problems with promising performance .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : mapping ]",
    "we summarize the semiclassical procedure for constructing a classical model of a second quantized hamiltonian .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] describes the resonant level model , which is used as a test case to assess the accuracy of the semiclassical approach .",
    "exact quantum mechanical results for the resonant level model are provided in section  [ sec : exact ] .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] summarizes the main results and provides a detailed comparison between the semiclassical approach and the exact quantum mechanical treatment .",
    "the comparisons cover a wide range of gate and bias potentials from high to low temperatures .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] summarizes and concludes .",
    "the approach that has been used  @xcite to construct semiclassical models for electronic degrees of freedom is to invert ( as meaningfully as possible ) the heisenberg correspondence relation , @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 is the number of degrees of freedom , and @xmath3 is a function of the classical action - angle variables . the heisenberg correpondence relation was originally used to obtain approximate matrix elements for @xmath4 from the corresponding classical function of action - angle variables ; the semiclassical goal here is to obtain a classical function of action - angle variables that corresponds ( as best as possible ) to the given quantum mechanical matrix elements of operator @xmath4 .",
    "the formal inverse of the fourier transform in eq .",
    "gives the angle dependence of the classical function as a fourier series , @xmath5 here , however , the procedure becomes nonunique ( and nonexact ) because the classical action variable @xmath6 has to interpolate for all real numbers , while the matrix elements are only defined for integer values of @xmath7 .",
    "one way to proceed is to use the spin - matrix mapping ( smm ) method of meyer and miller ( mm),@xcite which utilizes the fact that a general two - state system is equivalent to a spin @xmath8 system .",
    "thus any @xmath9 matrix @xmath10 , @xmath11 , can be written as a linear combination of the three spin matrices @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 ( and the @xmath9 identity matrix ) .",
    "one then uses the classical expressions for the spin angular momentum ,    @xmath15    in terms of the action - angle variables @xmath16 .",
    "the quantum values of the action variable @xmath17 ( the projection quantum number ) are @xmath18 , but it is convenient to have the quantum values of the action variables be @xmath19 ( unoccupied ) and @xmath20 ( occupied ) . the elementary canonical transformation @xmath21 makes this change , giving the classical function of action - angles @xmath22 for a general @xmath9 matrix @xmath23 as @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "the value of @xmath26 will be discussed below .    to employ this approach on a given second - quantized hamiltonian",
    ", mw used this smm model for each term in a hamiltonian .",
    "the hamiltonian in the present work has terms of the form @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the matrix elements of the operator @xmath27 are diagonal ,    @xmath29    which corresponds to eq .   with @xmath30 and @xmath31 for the @xmath32th degree of freedom , and to the identity matrix for all other degrees of freedom .",
    "the smm model thus gives @xmath33    the matrix elements for @xmath28 are    @xmath34    where we have assumed that @xmath35 . in the case @xmath36 , the product over @xmath37 goes from @xmath38 to @xmath39 : it always includes the states between ( but not including ) @xmath32 and @xmath40 .",
    "that product is the result of the anticommutation relation of fermionic creation / annihilation operators .",
    "these matrix elements are separable products of @xmath9 matrices : for the @xmath32th degree of freedom ( corresponding to the factor @xmath41 ) the @xmath9 matrix has @xmath42 as the only nonzero matrix element , so that eq .",
    "gives the corresponding classical function as @xmath43 for the @xmath40th degree of freedom ( i.e. , the factor @xmath44 ) , the only nonzero matrix element is @xmath45 , resulting in the classical function @xmath46 for each degree of freedom @xmath37 , with @xmath37 between @xmath32 and @xmath40 ( in normal ordered form ) , the factor @xmath47 from eq .",
    "corresponds to a diagonal @xmath48 matrix in eq .   with @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this smm method thus gives the classical function @xmath51    the net result is @xmath52 where the smm method gives @xmath53 .",
    "for the present application , however , we found that using these factors @xmath54 significantly underestimates the current ( see section  [ sec : results ] ) , while excellent results were obtained by omitting these factors , i.e. , by setting @xmath55 .",
    "we also tried an alternative , @xmath56 , but it had the same defect .",
    "the issue seems to be that with the quantum values of @xmath57 , the product of these factors is @xmath58 , while the classical value of @xmath59 frequently leads to @xmath60 .",
    "the product of many such factors leads to factors much less than @xmath20 , and thus off - diagonal coupling that are much too small .",
    "we now return to the value of @xmath61 ( which determines @xmath62 ) . for a classical spin with @xmath63 , @xmath64 , such that @xmath65 .",
    "however , mm suggested using the langer modified value @xmath66 , giving @xmath67 . here",
    ", we suggest instead using the quantum value of @xmath68 , and thus @xmath69 .",
    "the results in section  [ sec : results ] give empirical reasons for this choice .",
    "the choice @xmath70 also can be justified with the following argument . because the goal is to generate a mapping that accounts for the correct dynamics , it is reasonable to try to match the short - time dynamics of a simple problem .",
    "consider the hamiltonian @xmath71 , with initial population in state @xmath23 .",
    "the first time derivative of the initial ( @xmath72 ) quantum population of state @xmath23 is zero , as is that of our semiclassical model ( averaged over angles ) .",
    "the second derivative of the initial quantum population of state @xmath23 is @xmath73 , while the semiclassical model gives @xmath74 .",
    "if these are to be equal , then we must set @xmath70 .    to summarize , the modifications we have made to the original mw model are ( 1 ) to use a value of @xmath70 rather than the previously suggested langer modified value of @xmath75 , and ( 2 ) to set the factors @xmath54 in equation   to unity .",
    "the semiclassical mapping also requires the selection of initial conditions for the action - angle variables .",
    "it is clear that a nave approach based on the classical mapping described above will not provide the correct statistical treatment : even for the one - particle system @xmath76 , it does not reproduce the quantum partition function when the action - angle variables are sampled from the corresponding classical thermal distribution .",
    "to recover the correct statistical behavior ( at least at time @xmath72 ) we use a quasi - classical procedure .",
    "since we are interested in a noncorrelated initial state with thermally populated leads and an unpopulated quantum dot , we can populate each degree of freedom independently .",
    "we enforce quantum statistics on the initial conditions for each degree of freedom @xmath32 by setting the initial action @xmath77 to either @xmath19 or @xmath20 such that the expectation value of the action @xmath78 , averaged over the set of initial conditions , satisfies the fermi distribution , @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the chemical potential of the lead in which mode @xmath32 is located and @xmath81 is the inverse temperature .",
    "the angle variable @xmath82 is selected at random between @xmath19 and @xmath83 .",
    "we use the resonant level ( landauer ) model as an example of quantum transport .",
    "it consists of a single quantum dot state coupled to two electrodes ( left and right ) according to the hamiltonian @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the energy of the isolated quantum dot ( and will also be used to model a gate voltage ) , @xmath86 is the energy associated with the electrode mode @xmath87 , and @xmath88 is the coupling between the quantum dot and the electrode mode @xmath87 .    using the procedure described in section  [ sec : mapping ]",
    ", we construct the classical model of this hamiltonian in action - angle variables : @xmath89    the left current is given by the change in occupancy of the left electrode , with the right current defined analogously and the total current given by half the difference of the two . for the hamiltonian in eq .  , the heisenberg time derivative gives the left current as : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the set of states in the left electrode .",
    "we can choose to take the semiclassical approximation before the time derivative by mapping the occupation to a classical quantity and taking its time derivative , or we can take the result of the quantum time derivative and map that to a classical quantity . for this system ,",
    "our mapping method gives formally equivalent results for either procedure .",
    "the electrodes are described within the wide band limit with a sharp cutoff at high and low energy values : @xmath92 where , in all results reported below we use @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 . for the semiclassical mapping",
    ", we use a uniform discretization to select the energies of the leads states , and thus the couplings are given by @xmath97",
    "an exact quantum mechanical solution for the transient current for the hamiltonian specified above is straightforward to derive , and thus provides means to assess the accuracy of the semiclassical treatment . under the assumptions of no correlation at @xmath72 @xmath98 and a boltzmann distribution for the leads populations @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the fermi function and as before @xmath101 is the chemical potential for the left ( l ) or right ( r ) lead",

    "one is accustomed to quasi - classical treatments being semi - quantitative , e.g. , for quantized vibrational and rotational dofs  and even for electronically nonadiabatic transitions between two or three electronic states  but the level of accuracy seen in the present work is much better than that reported in such cases . it may be that the dense set of electronic states that constitute the left and right electrodes in the present molecular model leads to a rapid decay of the initial factorized state to the steady state , and thus makes the overall system behave more classically .",
    "the present results encourage one to expand the treatment to more realistic molecular models of such phenomena .",
    "it is obvious how to include nuclear degrees of freedom in the classical molecular dynamics simulations along with the classical model for the electronics dofs . also , mw s classical electronic model is able to include electron correlation , i.e. , two electron interactions in the second - quantized hamiltonian of the type @xmath163 which would be necessary to describe effects such as coulomb blockade .",
