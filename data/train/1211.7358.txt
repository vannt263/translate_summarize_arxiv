    "recently , much attention has been paid to the exactly solvable models of one - dimensional magnetism , consisting of small quantum spin clusters connected to each other via ising spins.@xcite for the sake of simplicity we will call them heisenberg  ising chains ( hic ) .",
    "the interest toward such spin systems stems from several features they possess .",
    "first of all , they allow one to obtain an exact statistical - mechanical solution of the problem of strongly interacting spins in terms of classical transfer matrix@xcite .",
    "in addition to that , such systems combine the quantum and classical properties and also , to some extent , are connected to the problems and models of molecular magnetism@xcite , as the classical transfer matrix is constructed by the diagonalization of the small quantum spin cluster . and",
    "finally , very recently the family of trimetallic coordination polymer compounds has been synthesized@xcite .",
    "these compounds in the magnetic sense are indeed a one - dimensional magnets with both classical ( ising ) and quantum ( heisenberg ) bonds . the single - chain magnet reported in ref .",
    "is an example of a heisenberg - ising chain of triangles with three - spin linear quantum clusters ; another interesting molecular magnet ( spin ring ) based on the highly anisotropic properties of the dy@xmath0 ions has been reported in ref .  .",
    "both systems have been analyzed by the transfer - matrix solution of hic chains in ref .  .",
    "another class of examples is given by chain magnets with two alternating magnetic ions , thus giving rise to alternating quantum and classical spins ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "let us describe the general scheme of the hic : +    * there is a small cluster of a few quantum spins with a certain topology of bonds which could contain various types of spin - spin interaction as well as interactions with external fields .",
    "the hamiltonian of the single small cluster is , thus , a finite dimensional matrix . + * these clusters are assembled to the chain or any other one - dimensional structure by alternating with the single ising spins . +",
    "* the interaction between the single ising spins and any quantum spin from a small cluster must contain only @xmath1-components ( ising interaction ) .    for the mixed quantum ",
    "classical spin system with the above mentioned properties the exact solution is obtained in the following way .",
    "the idea is to apply a classical transfer - matrix formalism in which the entries of the classical transfer matrix are obtained from the diagonalization of a small quantum spin cluster .",
    "although the number of papers devoted to the exact solutions of the hic and to their magneto - thermal properties is rather impressive , only a few models have been solved within the classical transfer matrix formalism@xcite , while the other method of the so - called decoration iteration transformation has been also used@xcite .",
    "particularly , within the direct classical transfer matrix technique the following models have been solved exactly : the double - tetrahedral chain with quantum triangles of spins@xcite , the sawtooth chain with an asymmetric pair of quantum spins@xcite , diamond chain@xcite and orthogonal - dimer chain with anisotropic and asymmetric quantum triangles@xcite . despite the complete and exact description of the ground states and ground states phase diagrams , as well of all thermodynamic functions , finite - temperature entropy and magnetization , magnetocaloric effect , etc , the expressions for the correlation function are still missing .",
    "it is worth mentioning , that the correlation functions can be in principle calculated by another method which is used to handle the hic , the technique of the decoration iteration transformation@xcite .",
    "however , the method of the classical transfer matrix is more straightforward and is based on a direct application of the canonical expectation values@xcite , which can be calculated exactly . in the present paper we are going to develop an exact technique for the calculation of any finite - temperature correlation function for any hic by means of the direct application of the classical transfer - matrix method .    beside the pure academic interest , the knowledge about the exact correlation functions of the hic recently became important from the experimental point of view as well .",
    "as mentioned above , a few years ago it was reported about the synthesis of a novel class of trimetallic coordination polymer compounds@xcite which are the real examples of the hic ( at least one of them ) .",
    "as known , the neutron scattering is one of the most powerful and straightforward methods of investigation of the magnetic structure , spin textures , magnetic excitations , etc . in the leading order",
    "the cross - section of the neutron scattering is given by the two - point spin - spin correlation functions ( their fourier - transform ) .",
    "this fact makes the topic of the present paper a practical issue .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the second section",
    "we remind the reader of the main features of the classical transfer - matrix formalism for the hic , in the next section we present the formalism for calculating the correlation function of hic in terms of traces of certain matrix products and prove that for all kinds of correlation functions the correlation length is the same . in section",
    "iv we apply the general formalism for several models .",
    "the paper ends with a conclusion .",
    "the hamiltonian of a hic has the form of a sum of local block hamiltonians @xmath2 which correspond to the n - th small quantum cluster and its interaction with left and right ising spins : @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the ising spin situated between the n - th and ( n+1)-th small cluster and @xmath5 is the magnetic field acting on ising spins .",
    "the block hamiltonian can contain various terms with quantum and classical spin variables which are determined by the topology of the elementary block and the character of interactions .",
    "let us denote the quantum spins by @xmath6 ; then one can suppose that the block hamiltonian depends on @xmath6 , @xmath7 and may be on other classical spins @xmath8 , @xmath9 due to the properties listed above the block hamiltonians commute to each other , @xmath10=0.\\ ] ] this fact allows one to expand the exponential in the expression for the partition function of the model and obtain an expression which by its structure corresponds to the classical transfer matrix scheme :    @xmath11    here the cyclic boundary conditions are supposed , @xmath12 are the eigenvalues of the block hamiltonian @xmath2(which is supposed to be an @xmath13 by @xmath13 matrix ) depending on the values of classical spins @xmath14 and classical spins @xmath4 which alternate with the blocks , @xmath15 means the trace over the states of the @xmath16-th quantum block , and @xmath17 stands for the trace of the 2 by 2 transfer matrix with entries @xmath18 .",
    "after summation over the values of @xmath14 for each block one gets the expression depending only on @xmath4 and @xmath19 which is the classical 2 by 2 transfer matrix @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the partition function of one block , depending on the values of two neighboring ising spins , signs `` @xmath22 '' and `` @xmath23 '' in indexes correspond to @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "the formalism of classical transfer - matrix allows one to obtain exact analytic expressions for almost any expectation values of the function of local variables ( spins ) and , of course , for any thermodynamic functions , as the expression for the free energy per block can be obtained in a straightforward way by finding the maximal eigenvalue of the transfer matrix ( [ t ] ) :    @xmath26    from this expression any thermodynamic function , like magnetization , entropy , specific head etc can be obtained exactly",
    ". however , to obtain correlation functions of the spins demands more efforts and further development of the classical transfer - matrix technique .",
    "let us concentrate on the scheme of calculation of the expectation values of combinations of spins operators .",
    "first of all , let us start from the simplest case , the expectation values of @xmath7-s , which is quite similar to that of the ising chain@xcite .",
    "thus , for the thermodynamic average of just one @xmath7 one obtains @xmath27 this expression is the trace of the product of @xmath28 transfer - matrices with the matrix @xmath29 inserted before the @xmath30-th transfer matrix in the trace formula .",
    "thus , we have @xmath31 where we used the matrix identity @xmath32 , with the diagonal matrix @xmath33 and the orthogonal matrix @xmath34 .",
    "thus , @xmath35 where @xmath36 are the eigenvalues of the transfer - matrix , and @xmath37 is a parameter . having all these notations we now can express the canonical expectation values from eq .",
    "( [ m_sig ] ) in terms of the entries of the orthogonal matrix diagonalizing the transfer - matrix . using the properties of the trace ( cyclic",
    "permutation inside the trace does not change it ) one can get @xmath38 now , we should take care about the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "it is easy to see , that in this limit eq .",
    "( [ m_sig3 ] ) leads to ( suppose that @xmath40 is greater than @xmath41 ) @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the partial magnetization corresponding to the subsystem with @xmath7-spins , @xmath44 thus , we can express the entries of the orthogonal matrix diagonalizing the transfer matrix in terms of the subsystem magnetization @xmath43 : @xmath45 these quantities are the building blocks for the calculation of all correlation function for the hic . as will be clear from further consideration , any correlation function of hic has the form of the trace of a certain product of transfer matrices and special matrices representing the spin operators .",
    "moreover , these matrices are constructed from the local expectation values of spin operators with the aid of the matrix @xmath46 in the standard way @xmath47 .",
    "let us write down the entries of a general matrix of that type    @xmath48 , \\\\ & & { \\widetilde}{p}_{+-}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\sqrt{1-m_{\\sigma}^2}\\left(p_{--}-p_{++}\\right ) + \\left(1+m_{\\sigma}\\right)p_{+-}-\\left(1-m_{\\sigma}\\right)p_{-+}\\right],\\nonumber \\\\ & & { \\widetilde}{p}_{-+}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\sqrt{1-m_{\\sigma}^2}\\left(p_{--}-p_{++}\\right ) + \\left(1+m_{\\sigma}\\right)p_{-+}-\\left(1-m_{\\sigma}\\right)p_{+-}\\right],\\nonumber \\\\ & & { \\widetilde}{p}_{--}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\left(1-m_{\\sigma}\\right)p_{++}-\\sqrt{1-m_{\\sigma}^2}\\left ( p_{+-}+p_{-+}\\right)+ \\left(1+m_{\\sigma}\\right)p_{--}\\right].\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for instance , the matrix @xmath49 which is the building block for constructing various correlation functions of @xmath50 has a particulary simple form : @xmath51 the simple two - site correlation function is just a thermal average of the product of two @xmath7 spins situated at a distance @xmath52 from each other :    @xmath53    thus , using the matrix form of @xmath54 and taking a thermodynamic limit one obtains : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a correlation length .",
    "so far , all results have the same form as those for a simple ising chain , the difference is only in the form of the magnetization for @xmath7-spins , which in our case is given by eqs .",
    "( [ m_via_t ] ) and ( [ t ] ) .",
    "now , let us turn to the more complicated correlation functions of the quantum spins with each other and mixed correlation functions ,    @xmath57    where the new 2 by 2 matrices @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the classical transfer - matrix formalism representation of the @xmath60-component of the @xmath61-th quantum spin and classical @xmath61-th spins from the corresponding quantum clusters .",
    "their entries are found according to @xmath62 the correlation functions containing the quantum spins @xmath63 have the unusual overall power of the @xmath33-matrix smaller than the number of the blocks @xmath28 .",
    "the point is that the inclusion of each quantum spin into the function reduces the overall power of the @xmath33-matrix by one .",
    "this technical difference from the standard classical technique@xcite stems out from the following feature .",
    "one does not have the spin operators @xmath64 by themselves under the trace in the canonical expectation value expression corresponding to the correlation function . instead , there are some complicated matrices given by eq .",
    "( [ sigma , tau ] ) and representing the quantum spin operators in the generalized classical transfer - matrix formalism . as it is seen from eq .",
    "( [ sigma , tau ] ) , due to the quantum nature of the variables @xmath63 , the corresponding matrix representation for them adsorbs the transfer matrix and it is an issue to find a representation where the resulting matrix under the trace into the partition function would be just a product of the transfer - matrix and some other matrix . on the contrary , for the classical spin chains for arbitrary spin",
    "the expression @xmath65 is the analog of the eq .",
    "( [ sigma , tau ] ) which appears under the trace formula in the corresponding correlation function .",
    "thus , the corresponding matrix to be inserted into the trace formula can be easily and naturally split into the product of the transfer matrix and a diagonal matrix with the possible values of the classical variable @xmath63 on its diagonal@xcite .",
    "this fact leads also to another consequence concerning the properties of the correlation functions from eq .",
    "( [ cor_ss_ssig ] ) .",
    "the expressions are no longer valid for @xmath66 .",
    "all these cases should be considered separately out of the framework of the technique developed here . however , the correlation functions at @xmath66 for the same spin operator are trivial because they are just a expectation values of the square of spin , while correlation functions for the different spins belonging to the same block can be easily calculated by taking a derivatives of the free energy with respect to the corresponding coupling constants .",
    "as the expressions under the trace in eq.([cor_ss_ssig ] ) have the same structure , let us write down a general expression for such a correlation function @xmath67 where the correlation length @xmath56 is the same as in eq.([cor_sig_sig ] ) . obviously , the part independent of @xmath52 is the product of expectation values of quantities corresponding to matrices @xmath68 and @xmath69 , @xmath70 the product of two eigenvalues of the 2 by 2 transfer matrix is its determinant , thus , eventually one can write down the following general form of pair - correlation function for hic : @xmath71 if one of the matrices is @xmath7 the result is different , because the corresponding expression contains one more transfer matrix . in general , it also depends on the position of the @xmath7 , unless the matrix @xmath72 is symmetric .",
    "thus , the corresponding expressions for the correlation functions are @xmath73 the matrix @xmath72 , in its turn , is symmetric when the corresponding matrix @xmath68 is symmetric .",
    "thus , the order of @xmath74 and @xmath75 in the correlation function does not matter in this case : @xmath76 . from this general consideration",
    "one can see that there exists only a single correlation length for any kind of correlation functions of the hic .",
    "this is rather expected result because the appearance of a single correlation length even in the inhomogeneous situation is the common feature of all one - dimensional systems which do not become critical at finite temperature .",
    "this is , however , true only for a long range correlation with respect to the block structure of the system ; inside one block short range correlations are non - uniform .",
    "in this section we are going to illustrate the technique of calculation of correlation functions for hic by several examples . as the technique , despite its clearness and simplicity , leads to rather cumbersome expressions , we will present explicit calculations for the simplest models which have been investigated earlier in a context of magnetic and thermodynamic properties@xcite .",
    "one can distinguish at least two classes of hic : the models where each block has a left - right symmetry with respect to the interaction with @xmath7 spins@xcite , which implies that the term describing the interaction between block spins and their left and right @xmath7-neighbors has the form @xmath77 , which is completely symmetric with respect to the permutation of the operators @xmath78 , and the models which are non symmetric with respect to left and right @xmath7-spins on each block@xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning , that the experimentally obtained single chain magnet compound with ising and heisenberg bonds , which is an existing example of hic , belongs to the second type@xcite .",
    "magnetic properties of the asymmetric model are vast and complicated , they can exhibit a large number of ground states with a breaking of translational symmetry or doubling of the unit cell ( block)@xcite . in the most symmetric case the block hamiltonian is completely symmetric with respect to the permutation of all spins in it .",
    "such models are the simplest ones .",
    "for instance , the various variants of the heisenberg  ising diamond chain@xcite and heisenebrg - ising tetrahedral@xcite and double - tetrahedral chains@xcite belong to this class of hic .",
    "it is obvious , that in this case the matrices @xmath79 are the same for all spins inside one block , or , in other words , in this case one does not need the additional index @xmath61 .     heisenberg - ising diamond chain .",
    "solid ( dashed ) lines denote quantum xxz ( classical ising ) interaction bonds .",
    "all dashed bonds correspond to the coupling constant @xmath80 , the interaction between quantum spins is characterized by the coupling constant @xmath81 and anisotropy @xmath82 . ]",
    "the symmetric heisenberg - ising diamond chain is the simplest example of hic ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",

    "first of all , the general remarks about correlations in hic are noteworthy .",
    "the general structure of the hic exclude any possibility to have an entangled non trivial macroscopic ground state , on the contrary , any macroscopic ground state is just a tensor product of the local ground states , which , in their turn , could be entangled .",
    "thus , the zero - temperature long - range correlations between the spins from different blocks , calculated with respect to their expectation values , are trivial which implies the zero value of all correlation function from eq .",
    "( [ sc_all_corr ] ) at @xmath113 , as for the arbitrary ground state @xmath114 one has @xmath115 however , the thermal fluctuations as well as the effect of the magnetic field lead to non - zero correlations within a narrow interval of low temperatures for short distances . the plots of the temperature dependence of all correlation functions for the asymmetric sawtooth chain are presented in figure [ fig3 ] for the distance equal to one block , @xmath116 . here ,",
    "the values of the parameters correspond to the spin - modulated zero - temperature ground state of the asymmetric heisenberg - ising sawtooth chain@xcite .",
    "it is rather expectable that the finite - temperature correlations are mostly of short range with respect to blocks , but as one block contains four spins , the non - zero , though weak , correlations even for @xmath116 are the non - trivial result .",
    "one can see from the plots in figure [ fig3 ] the vanishing of all correlations at high as well as at low temperatures as was mentioned above .",
    "as expected , the closer to each other are situated the spins from different blocks , the larger is the magnitude of the correlation between them .",
    "for instance , the correlation between @xmath96 and @xmath117 at the temperature corresponding to the peak is four times larger in absolute value than the correlation between @xmath96 and @xmath118 and more that seventy times larger than the correlation between @xmath119 and @xmath120 . in the same time , the correlation between @xmath121 are the strongest ones , though , the are separated by the dependence of the correlation functions against the distance for the same values of coupling constants and anisotropy and for temperatures corresponding to the strongest correlation of the thermal fluctuations are presented in figure [ fig4 ] . for all correlation functions one can see the usual exponential decay in their absolute value .",
    "the sign of the correlations is defined by the mutual orientation of the corresponding spins which can be seen in the @xmath113 ground state@xcite for the given set of the parameters . in figure [ fig5 ]",
    "we presented the plots of the same correlation functions @xmath122 and @xmath123 against the distance for different temperatures .",
    "the non - monotonous behavior of the correlation functions described above can be clearly seen from the plots .",
    "in the present paper we elaborated a technique for calculating correlation functions in hic .",
    "the technique is based on the classical transfer - matrix formalism which proves itself as the most efficient and straightforward method of treating the hic , allowing one to obtain exact expressions for the partition function and , thus , for all thermodynamic functions in a quite simple way@xcite . however , the classical transfer - matrix formalism is also very convenient for the calculation of the correlation functions of various kinds , because all canonical expectation values are expressed in terms of traces of certain products of the transfer - matrices with matrices representing the microscopic variables in the transfer - matrix formalism@xcite .",
    "we presented a detailed scheme of calculation of the correlation functions for hic , obtained general expressions for the corresponding trace formulas and presented the general expressions for the matrix representations of the main microscopic variables for the typical hic , quantum spin operators , additional classical spins from block hamiltonians and intermediate spin . as it is expected from general principles , the spatial decay of any correlation between any pair of spin",
    "is characterized by a single correlation length obtained in a standard way as the reciprocal of the logarithm of the ratio of the largest and second largest eigenvalues of the classical transfer matrix . in the simplest case considered here when intermediate classical @xmath7-spins are 1/2 spins the transfer matrix has dimension 2 by 2 and , thus , only two eigenvalues . however , the prefactors are strongly affected by the microscopic variables .",
    "we illustrated our general formalism by two examples , the simplest hic , symmetric heisenberg - ising diamond - chain and asymmetric heisenberg - ising sawtooth chain with a pair of quantum spins in the unit cell .",
    "we presented the exact form of the transfer - matrix , its eigenvalues , matrix representation corresponding to the classical transfer - matrix formalism for quantum spin operators , matrix representation for additional classical spin from block hamiltonian and all possible pair correlation functions .",
    "a very important feature of the correlations function of the hic considered in the present paper is the absence of correlations between transverse components of quantum spins from different blocks .",
    "the corresponding matrix representation of the @xmath124 and @xmath125 operators are identically zero .",
    "this fact is an obvious consequence of the structure of the hic where blocks interact to each other only through @xmath1-components of the spins .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the general idea of using the classical transfer - matrix for describing the thermodynamic properties of decorated spin lattices can be applied also for two - dimensional systems .",
    "although the existing examples of the papers devoted to the topic deal with the decoration - iteration transformation@xcite , the direct generalization of the existing transfer - matrix method is possible .",
    "as known , two - dimensional systems can exhibit phase transitions at finite temperature in contrast to the one - dimensional models where only zero - temperature transitions are possible . in principle",
    ", two - dimensional spin systems can possess a complicated structure of the order parameters , and multiple orderings , which , particularly , can be different in different spatial directions .",
    "for these reasons , the statement about the unique correlation length is no longer valid here .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
