    "the standard algorithm for square lattice dla@xcite is as follows :    1 .",
    "let the initial cluster consist of a single seed particle at the origin of the lattice .",
    "2 .   launch a new particle on a launching circle of radius @xmath18 that contains the current cluster .",
    "in other words , generate an angle @xmath19 from the uniform distribution on @xmath20 , and set @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "3 .   move the particle east , west , north , or south with equal probability .",
    "if the particle is adjacent to the cluster , add it to the cluster , and go back to step 2 .",
    "if the particle has diffused outside the killing circle of radius @xmath23 , discard it , and go back to step 2 .",
    "go back to step 3 .    the launching radius is typically taken to be @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the radius of the bounding circle circumscribing the cluster.@xcite the killing radius may be as small@xcite as @xmath26 or as large@xcite as @xmath27 .    obviously , dla is a stochastic process involving random numbers",
    ". measurements of observables ( such as @xmath11 ) are subject to random error , which can not be eliminated , but can be reduced by averaging over many simulations , or by self - averaging as part of going to larger system sizes .",
    "however , one should be wary of systematic errors .",
    "these can not be removed by any amount of statistical averaging .",
    "moreover , emergent phenomena such as the self - organized critical behavior of dla may be strongly affected by any bias inadvertently introduced by the algorithm .",
    "the original algorithm suffers from two potential sources of systematic error :    1 .",
    "the launching circle only passes through a few lattice points .",
    "when launching a new particle , we must snap its coordinates to the grid , introducing roundoff error . for a particle accreting onto a cluster of linear size @xmath28",
    "one may worry that the errors may be as large as @xmath29 .",
    "2 .   for a 2d random walk ,",
    "even if a particle has wandered outside the killing circle , there is a @xmath30 probability that it will eventually re - enter the launching circle .",
    "the particle is more likely to enter at the near side of the circle than at the far side . by removing the particle from the killing circle and re - launching it from a uniform distribution on the launching circle ,",
    "the algorithm introduces a bias that may affect results such as @xmath11 .",
    "even if the killing radius is @xmath28 times the cluster radius , the errors in the return probabilities may still be as large as @xmath29 .",
    "* snap - to - grid error due to launching circle : * let us first address the first source of systematic error .",
    "suppose we launch a particle on a launching circle of radius @xmath18 and snap its coordinates to the grid as described earlier . the probability distribution of the point @xmath31 is @xmath32 suppose we generate many particles from this distribution and let them diffuse via brownian random walks .",
    "what is the steady - state concentration of particles within the launching circle ? how far does it deviate from a uniform distribution ?",
    "this brownian problem maps to an electrostatics problem .",
    "the source distribution maps to a charge distribution @xmath33 , and the steady - state distribution of particles maps to the electric potential @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the green function of the square lattice poisson equation such that @xmath36 because of the long - range logarithmic divergence in 2d , @xmath35 contains an infinite additive constant .",
    "thus we define the regularized green function @xmath37 .",
    "the quantities @xmath38 are related to the resistances between two points on a square lattice of resistors,@xcite and as described in appendix [ secgreenfunction ] , it can be calculated to machine precision for any @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "compare the potential with that at a reference point @xmath41 , which might as well be the origin @xmath42 : @xmath43    we calculate the charges @xmath44 numerically according to eq .  , and we perform a fast 2d convolution with @xmath38 to obtain @xmath45 .",
    "figures  [ circlecharges ] , [ circlepotentials ] , and [ circlepotentialsalongpath ] show the charges and potentials for a launching circle of radius 20 .",
    "the ring of charge is distorted by snapping to the grid , leading to potential fluctuations on the scale of @xmath46 .    *",
    "eliminating bias using a fuzzy launching annulus : * it is useful to take some insights from computer graphics .",
    "early raster displays rendered oblique lines and circles with jagged edges .",
    "modern displays eliminate this problem using antialiasing.@xcite in the context of dla , one might hope that launching bias might be reduced by `` antialiasing '' the launching circle .",
    "the launching bias comes from the high - order fourier components in @xmath47 that can not be represented on the grid .",
    "perhaps if we thicken the launching circle into an annulus and smear out its inner and outer boundaries , the resulting probability distribution will be smoother , and quantization error will be reduced .",
    "we will show that this is indeed true .",
    "suppose we pick a radius from the probability distribution @xmath48 where @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the bessel @xmath51 function .",
    "this distribution corresponds to to a normalized kaiser - bessel window function@xcite on the interval @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "we choose the kaiser - bessel window because it has very small spectral leakage beyond the central lobe , and because the distribution is easy to evaluate and sample compared to the optimal dolph - chebyshev window.@xcite we also pick an angle @xmath19 from the uniform distribution on @xmath20 , and set @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the probability distribution of the point @xmath31 is then @xmath53 we calculate @xmath54 and @xmath55 as before .",

    "we use a launching annulus with @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath61 , where @xmath25 is the bounding radius of the cluster .",
    "since the cluster is well within the interior of the annulus , launching bias is negligible .",
    "we sample @xmath39 from @xmath65 using rejection sampling@xcite with a gaussian envelope function .",
    "( in rejection sampling one must keep retrying until a move is accepted , unlike in the metropolis algorithm .",
    "a better term would be `` retrial sampling '' . )",
    "the second source of systematic error is the killing - and - relaunching .",
    "we will eliminate this error by using an enormous killing circle of radius @xmath66 .",
    "what is the catch in using large launching and killing circles ? recall that a particle executing brownian motion has a r.m.s .",
    "displacement that grows very slowly with time , @xmath67 .",
    "if a particle is launched @xmath68 sites away from the cluster , it will take at least @xmath69 timesteps before the particle has an appreciable probability of encountering the cluster !",
    "thus , in order to make a dla simulation feasible , we must find a way to accelerate the diffusion process  that is , we must `` fast forward '' through the random walk .",

    "in other words , we are to find the charge distribution induced on a grounded conducting object by an external point charge . rather than solving the discrete differential equation for the potential @xmath45 in all space , it is better to solve the discrete integral equation for the charges @xmath76 on the surface of the conductor .",
    "this takes the form of @xmath77 simultaneous equations in @xmath77 variables .",
    "formally , we have @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath35 is the green function of the square lattice poisson equation such that @xmath36 the long - range logarithmic divergence in 2d poses two additional complications .",

    "walk - to - line algorithm : * we now apply this formalism to the situation shown in fig .",
    "[ walktoline ] . we will call this the walk - to - line ( wtl ) problem on a square lattice .",

    ", we see that if a particle is launched at @xmath85 , the probability distribution of first passage to the @xmath39-axis is @xmath90 there are an infinite number of probabilities corresponding to all integer @xmath39 .",
    "we sample this distribution using rejection sampling.@xcite in order to use rejection sampling , we need an envelope function that resembles the target distribution ( the probability distribution that we wish to sample from ) . to obtain a suitable envelope function , consider the continuum version of the walk - to - line problem .",
    "suppose a particle starts at @xmath85 and executes continuum brownian motion until it encounters the line @xmath91 .",
    "the electrostatic analog is a unit charge at @xmath85 and a grounded conducting plane at @xmath91 .",
    "solve poisson s equation with dirichlet boundary conditions using the method of images .",
    "the potential is @xmath92 , and so the charge density on the line is @xmath93 .",
    "thus the first - passage probability distribution is @xmath94 .",
    "the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) is @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , we can generate a sample from @xmath96 using the inverse cdf method as @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is a random number from the uniform distribution on @xmath99 .",
    "now , since the target distribution is discrete , consider generating a sample using @xmath100 this corresponds to the discrete envelope distribution @xmath101 the rejection sampling algorithm is as follows :",

    "for our purposes we can choose @xmath104 .",
    "2 .   draw a random integer @xmath39 from the envelope distribution @xmath105 ( gray symbols in fig .",

    "now suppose the particle is a large distance @xmath109 away from the cluster .",
    "then , eq .   implies that the walk - to - line algorithm is roughly equivalent to multiplying @xmath109 by a random number @xmath110 drawn from a lorentzian distribution : @xmath111 thus , the logarithm of the radius is incremented by a random number @xmath112 drawn from a sech distribution : @xmath113 the variance of the sech distribution is @xmath114 therefore , @xmath115 executes a random walk with a step variance of @xmath116 .",

    "expand the charge distribution @xmath128 and the potential @xmath45 in fourier sine series , and connect them via the discrete poisson equation : @xmath129 we implement eq .   using the fast 2d discrete sine transform ( dst ) .",
    "this allows us to compute @xmath45 for all @xmath39 and @xmath40 in @xmath130 time .",
    "this is faster than evaluating the double sums @xmath131 which takes @xmath132 time . for @xmath133",
    "the dst method takes a long time and accumulates roundoff errors of the order of @xmath0 .",
    "then it becomes preferable to calculate @xmath45 as a madelung sum involving an infinite series of positive and negative image charges , @xmath134 for speed and accuracy , split @xmath38 into a @xmath135 part plus a correction due lattice anisotropy ( eq .  ) .",
    "this gives @xmath45 as the solution to the continuum problem ( in terms of the jacobi cn function ) plus a lattice correction , which is best evaluated by grouping the charges into quadrupoles and truncating the sum appropriately .",
    "having found @xmath45 , we can find the electric field and hence the charge distribution on the boundary , @xmath136 .",

    "horizontal and vertical axes are scaled to show that @xmath142 approaches a universal function of @xmath143 as @xmath144 .",

    "we also maintain a hierarchy of coarse - grained representations of dimensions @xmath146 , representing @xmath147 blocks , for block sizes @xmath148 .",
    "every time a particle is added to the cluster , we mark the corresponding block at each level of the hierarchy as occupied .",
    "the total amount of memory required is @xmath149 .",
    "thus , all the coarse arrays together require only @xmath150 extra memory .",
    "suppose the diffusing particle is within the bounding box of the cluster , so that the walk - to - line algorithm is inapplicable .",
    "we can revert to moving the particle one step at a time .",

    "[ agg4-l65536-cluster ] we can see that a particle in the corner of the bounding box would spend @xmath153 timesteps wandering around in a cavity of linear size @xmath154 .",
    "fortunately , the walk - to - square algorithm allows us to speed up the diffusion process .",
    "we start at the coarsest level of the hierarchy ( @xmath155 blocks ) and examine the @xmath156 array of blocks around the diffusing particle s block .",
    "if any one of these nine blocks is occupied , we proceed to the next finer level of the hierarchy .",
    "we repeat this until we get to a level where all nine blocks are empty .",
    "this means that we can move the particle by @xmath157 units in the @xmath39 direction and @xmath157 units in the @xmath40 direction without contacting the cluster .",
    "therefore we can apply the walk - to - square algorithm for a square of side @xmath158 centered on the diffusing particle .",
    "many authors have used hierarchical representations and variable stepsizes.@xcite meakin et al.@xcite used a combination of off - lattice jumps and on - lattice steps .",
    "al.@xcite used a lookup table calculated using laplace s equation to compute the first passage to the square in a manner accurate to better than @xmath15 .",

    "[ annuluscharges ] ) .",
    "3 .   if the walker lies outside the bounding rectangle of the cluster , use the walk - to - line algorithm to move the walker to an infinite line on the near side of the bounding box ( see fig .",
    "[ walktoline ] ) .",
    "if this takes the walker outside the killing circle of radius @xmath161 , discard the walker and go back to step 2 .",
    "+   + if instead the walker lies inside the bounding rectangle , start at the coarsest level of the hierarchy , and proceed to finer and finer levels until one finds a scale at which all eight neighboring blocks contain no sticky sites .",
    "then , apply the walk - out - to - square algorithm to move the walker to an edge of a square contained within the empty region ( see fig .",
    "[ walkouttosquare ] ) .",
    "4 .   if the walker is now at a sticky site , freeze it ( i.e. , add it to the cluster and mark its neighbors as new sticky sites ) and go to step 2 . otherwise , go to step 3 .    in this algorithm",
    "all probability distributions are sampled with errors less than @xmath0 .",

    "the electrostatic problem is easily solved by the method of images , and the return probability distribution can be evaluated and sampled analytically .",
    "this is exploited in a killing - free algorithm for continuum dla@xcite where particles that escape from the launching circle are immediately returned to the launching circle . for lattice dla ,",
    "however , circular or spherical boundaries do not fit naturally on the lattice . snapping to",
    "the grid leads to large errors , as we have shown . it may be possible to reduce these errors by returning the particle to a fuzzy annulus",
    "; we have not investigated this completely .",
    "suppose a particle starts at @xmath70 ( black disk ) and executes a random walk on the square lattice until it reaches a point @xmath31 on a square of side @xmath138 ( gray disks ) .",
    "the first - passage probabilities can be found using brute - force matrix computation , which takes @xmath214 time , but there is no simple analytic formula for general @xmath138 . ]    * walk - in - to - square methods : * what if we wish to return a particle to a bounding rectangle , square , or cube ?",
    "this requires finding the charge distribution on a conductor induced by an _ exterior _ point charge . whereas interior electrostatics problems are amenable to a variety of methods ( images , separation of variables , and conformal mapping ) , exterior electrostatics problems are notoriously difficult even in the continuum .",
    "the most accurate results for the capacitance of a cube have been obtained by mapping the electrostatic problem back to a random walk problem and using monte carlo techniques!@xcite it is probably futile to search for a simple analytic formula for the lattice problem ( see fig .",
    "[ walkintosquare ] ) .",
    "the walk - in - to - square problem can be solved numerically , but this takes @xmath214 time , where @xmath138 is the perimeter of the boundary . in comparison , the iterated walk - to - line method may take several hundred iterations to return the walker to the bounding box of the cluster , but this number of iterations is independent of cluster size .",
