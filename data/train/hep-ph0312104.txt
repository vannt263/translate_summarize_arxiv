    "understanding the internal structure of hadrons in terms of quarks and gluons ( partons ) , and in particular how quarks and gluons provide the binding and spin of the nucleon , is one of the outstanding problems in particle physics .",
    "+   +    electromagnetic form factors provide information on the spatial distribution of charge and magnetization in the nucleon , irrespective of the partons momenta and independent of the resolution scale .",
    "parton distributions measure the probability @xmath0 of finding a parton with fractional longitudinal momentum @xmath1 in the fast moving nucleon at a given transverse resolution @xmath2 , while no information on the transverse distribution of partons is provided .",
    "generalized parton distributions ( gpds )  @xcite describe the coherence of two different hadron wave functions @xmath3 , one where the parton carries fractional momentum @xmath4 and one where this fraction is @xmath5 , from which further information on the transverse distribution of partons can be drawn  @xcite . in the limit where the momentum transfer @xmath6 on the nucleon is purely transverse , i.e. @xmath7 and @xmath8 , gpds regain a probabilistic interpretation  @xcite . when fourier transformed to impact parameter space , they measure , for example , the probability of finding a parton of momentum fraction @xmath1 at the impact parameter @xmath9 . in fig .  1 we compare the information provided by form factors , parton distributions and gpds . in other words , gpds",
    "extend the well - known feynman parton distribution and electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon to new kinematic dimensions . in the forward limit ( @xmath10 ) , these distributions reduce to the feynman parton distributions .",
    "moments of gpds are amenable to lattice calculations  @xcite .",
    "thus , they offer promising ways to link phenomenological observations to first principle theoretical considerations . in this talk",
    "we will report on recent quenched results obtained by the qcdsf collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the calculation employs non - perturbatively improved wilson fermions and non - perturbative renormalization factors  @xcite of the operators whose matrix elements are involved .",
    "generally , improved wilson fermions show only a very mild cut - off dependence  @xcite .",
    "we may therefore restrict ourselves to calculations done on the @xmath11 lattice at @xmath12 .",
    "we shall consider the gpds @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the nucleon , where @xmath15 denotes the flavor of the struck quark .",
    "we will not consider the gluon sector here .",
    "the zeroth moments of @xmath13 and @xmath14 give the electromagnetic dirac and pauli form factors : @xmath16 both form factors have been computed on the lattice  @xcite . in fig .",
    "2 we show a typical result for the dirac form factor of the proton , @xmath17 . the solid curve is a dipole fit of the form @xmath18 in fig .",
    "3 the dipole mass @xmath19 is extrapolated to the physical pion mass .",
    "we find good agreement with the phenomenological value , which is approximately equal to the physical @xmath20 and @xmath21 mass .",
    "the first moment gives us generalized form factors of a class of tensor operators : @xmath22     +   +   +     +   +   +    where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are given by the nucleon matrix elements of the energy - momentum tensor ( emt ) : @xmath26 here @xmath27 denotes the nucleon mass , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and curly brackets refer to symmetrization of indices and subtraction of traces .",
    "the emt has twist two and spin two .",
    "it is assumed to be renormalized at the scale @xmath30 , which makes @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 scale and scheme dependent .",
    "for the classification of states of definite @xmath31 contributing to ( [ me ] ) in the @xmath32-channel see .",
    "the so - called skewedness parameter @xmath33 is defined by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a light - like vector with @xmath36 , and bounded by @xmath37 . in the forward limit , @xmath38 , the first moment of @xmath13 reduces to the first moment of the unpolarized parton distribution : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the distribution with quark spin parallel ( antiparallel ) to the spin of the nucleon .",
    "furthermore , we have  @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the angular momentum of the @xmath43 quark , and @xmath44 is the total angular momentum of the nucleon carried by the quarks .    in figs .  4 and 5 we show the generalized form factors @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 of the proton , again for @xmath51 mev .",
    "as for the nucleon form factors , the generalized form factors can be well described by the dipole ansatz @xmath52 and similarly for @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the numbers refer to the @xmath55 scheme at the renormalization scale @xmath56 .",
    "fits of @xmath45 and @xmath48 give the same dipole mass @xmath57 within errors .",
    "we therefore fit our data by a common dipole mass @xmath57 , only depending on the quark mass .",
    "for a reliable extrapolation to @xmath58 it is important to cover a wide enough range of @xmath59 .",
    "our data do not favor a monopole behavior .    in fig .",
    "6 we show the dipole mass @xmath57 as a function of the pion mass .",
    "again , the numbers appear to lie on a straight line .",
    "a linear extrapolation in @xmath60 to the physical pion mass gives @xmath61 .",
    "this value is close to the physical masses of the @xmath62 and @xmath63 mesons , which supports the hypothesis of tensor meson dominance .",
    "the numbers @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 show little variation with the quark mass and are extrapolated quadratically in @xmath60 to the physical pion mass .",
    "we obtain @xmath67    higher moments of @xmath13 and @xmath14 may be obtained in a similar way .",
    "knowing sufficiently many moments , we can reconstruct @xmath68 and @xmath69 by inverse mellin transform  @xcite .",
    "the angular momentum decomposes , in a gauge invariant way , into two contributions : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the orbital angular momentum and @xmath72 is the spin of the quark .",
    "we know @xmath73 from separate calculations  @xcite , so that @xmath71 can be computed from ( [ j ] ) .    in fig .",
    "7 we show the total angular momentum @xmath74 .",
    "the dependence on the pion mass is rather flat , as expected  @xcite .",
    "the errors are due to the relatively large statistical errors of @xmath75 and @xmath76 and the fact that @xmath75 and @xmath76 cancel to a large extent .",
    "a quadratic extrapolation in @xmath60 to the physical pion mass gives @xmath77 the numbers for @xmath78 refer to our latest results  @xcite , computed from the non - perturbatively improved axial vector current with non - perturbative renormalization factors .",
    "it turns out that the total angular momentum @xmath79 carried by the quarks amounts to @xmath80 of the spin of the ( quenched ) proton , leaving a contribution of @xmath81 for the gluons .",
    "the major contribution is given by the @xmath82 quark , while the contribution of the @xmath83 quark is found to be negligible , which hints at strong pairing effects .    from @xmath79 and @xmath84",
    "we can compute @xmath71 now .",
    "the total orbital angular momentum of the ( valence ) quarks turns out to be consistent with zero : @xmath85 this indicates that ( at virtuality @xmath56 ) the parton s transverse momentum in the ( quenched ) proton is small .",
    "if the dipole behavior ( [ df ] ) , ( [ dgpd ] ) continues to hold for the higher moments as well , and if we assume that the dipole masses continue to grow in a regge - like fashion , we may write @xmath86 with @xmath87 where @xmath88 gev@xmath89 and @xmath90 gev@xmath89 . we know",
    "@xmath91 from previous lattice calculations for @xmath92  @xcite .",
    "that is sufficient to compute @xmath93 by means of an inverse mellin transform  @xcite .",
    "having done so , the desired probability distribution of finding a parton of momentum fraction @xmath1 at the impact parameter @xmath9 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) is then obtained by the fourier transform of @xmath93 : @xmath94 in fig .",
    "8 we show a first attempt at a lattice calculation of @xmath95 for the @xmath82 quark distribution in the proton .",
    "the volume under the two - dimensional surface ( taken over the full kinematical range @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) gives us back @xmath98 .",
    "we see that at smaller values of @xmath1 the distribution in @xmath9 is rather broad ( and different from the distribution sketched in fig .  1 ) , while at larger values of @xmath1 it becomes somewhat more narrow .",
    "we also notice that the peak of the distribution is shifted slightly towards larger values of @xmath1 as @xmath99 is increased .",
    "we have presented a first quenched lattice estimate of the generalized parton distribution @xmath95 , assuming that the generalized form factors of the higher operators ( i.e. higher than the tensor operator ) can be described by a dipole ansatz as well , with dipole masses lying on a regge trajectory . as a by - product",
    "we obtained the total and orbital angular momentum of the nucleon carried by quarks .",
    "a calculation of the missing generalized form factors is in progress .",
    "we like to thank the organizers of lhp2003 , and in particular alex kalloniatis , for a most productive and pleasant workshop , and hope for many more to come . this work is supported in part by dfg and the ec under contract hprn - ct-2000 - 00145 .",
