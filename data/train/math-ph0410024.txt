    "in the course of numerical calculations in continuous mechanics , the equations of motion should be discretized in time variable to get certain schemes . among various discrete time schemes in hamiltonian mechanics ,",
    "the symplectic algorithm is quite successful @xcite , since it preserves the symplecticity . in lagrange mechanics ,",
    "the discretizations may be established via discrete variation method to get the symplectic - preserving integrators . but this variation is usually taken with respect to the discrete dependent variables only @xcite,@xcite .    thus , for the long time , there had been no discrete legendre transformation .",
    "therefore , the discrete lagrange and hamilton mechanics could not be transformed to each other .",
    "in addition , the equal - time - step symplectic integrators @xcite can not preserve the energy , while the variable time - step variational integrator proposed in @xcite preserves discretely energy but without proving the symplicticity . until recently , it is proposed @xcite that the energy conservation and symplicticity for the variational integrators with variable time - steps may be compatible .",
    "however , it is still open how to deal with discrete hamilton systems as well as symplectic algorithm by variational principle . in the meantime ,",
    "the difference discrete variational principle ( ddvp ) has been introduced in @xcite . and",
    "in this approach the discrete legendre transformation can be introduced and both discrete lagrange systems including variational integrators and hamilton systems including the schemes in symplectic algorithm can be transferred to each other .",
    "one of the key points in ddvp is that the difference is treated as an independent variational variable .",
    "very recently , ddvp with variable time step ( vddvp ) has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "thus the symplicticity and energy could be discretely preserved at equal footing .    in this paper",
    ", we propose the non - commutative differential calculus ( ncdc ) on fibre bundle over discrete base space in order to deal with the variation of some lagrange system with high order derivatives . based upon this ncdc we present the vddvp with variable time steps as well as the discrete version of the euler - lagrange cohomology and apply them to discrete mechanics including the generalized symplectic algorithm . for a given discrete action @xmath0 within finite time - duration , we obtain both discrete equations of motion and energy conservation equation from the total variation @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the total exterior differential operator , by means of vddvp with fixed end points of the duration .",
    "then we show that the discrete version of the first euler - lagrange cohomology does exist in the case of variable time - step .",
    "we also consider some simple example to show the advantages of our approach .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we propose an ncdc on the fibre bundle whose base space is 1-dimensional lattice with variable step - lengths . in section 3 , we present the vddvp and deal with both discrete lagrangian and hamiltonian mechanics based upon such an ncdc . in section 4 , we discuss the solution existence in finite time step - length and site density in continuous limit . in section 5 , by means of the vddvp , we obtain energy - conserving midpoint scheme for hamiltonian system that may depend on time manifestly and show its numerical properties .",
    "finally , we end with some remarks and discussions .",
    "for the lattice with equal spacing , an ncdc on its function space has been proposed in @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we generalize it to the one on the lattice with variable spacing in order to describe the vddvp on discrete mechanics including energy - preserving and symplectic algorithm .      for the simplicity ,",

    "<S> we propose the difference discrete variational principle in discrete mechanics and symplectic algorithm with variable step - length of time in finite duration based upon a noncommutative differential calculus established in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> this approach keeps both symplicticity and energy conservation discretely . </S>",
    "<S> we show that there exists the discrete version of the euler - lagrange cohomology in these discrete systems . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the solution existence in finite time - length and its site density in continuous limit , and apply our approach to the pendulum with periodic perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results are satisfactory .    </S>",
