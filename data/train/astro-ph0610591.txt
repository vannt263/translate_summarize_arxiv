    "the cross - correlation between the rosat all - sky survey ( @xmath2 150000 sources ) and the tycho mission ( @xmath2 1000000 stars ) catalogues has selected about 14000 stellar x - ray sources ( rastyc sample , @xcite ) . although most of these soft x - ray sources are expected to be the youngest stars in the solar neighborhood , neither the contamination by older rs  cvn systems nor the fraction of by  dra binaries are actually known .",
    "this information is , however , of fundamental importance for studying the recent local star formation history and , for instance , for putting constrains on the scale height of the spatial distribution of nearby young stars around the galactic plane .",
    "we thus started a spectroscopic observation campaign aimed at a deep characterisation of a representative sub - sample of the rastyc population .",
    "in addition to derive chromospheric activity levels ( from h@xmath1 emission ) and rotational velocities ( from doppler broadening ) , high resolution spectroscopic observations allow to infer ages ( by means of lithium abundance ) and to single out spectroscopic and active binaries . in this work we present some preliminary results of follow - up observations , both photometric and spectroscopic , of some rastyc stars performed with the 193-cm telescope of ohp and the 91-cm telescope of the catania astrophysical observatory ( oac ) .",
    "in particular , we analyse six new late - type binaries , for which we have obtained good radial velocity curves and orbital solutions .",
    "an accurate spectral classification for the single - lined binaries has been also performed and the projected rotational velocity @xmath3 has been measured for all stars .",
    "the chromospheric activity level and the lithium content have been also investigated using as diagnostics the h@xmath1 emission and the lii@xmath4 line , respectively .",

    "at ohp we observed in 2000 and 2001 with the elodie echelle spectrograph connected to the 193-cm telescope .",
    "the 67 orders recorded by the ccd detector cover the 3906 - 6818     wavelength range with a resolving power of about 42000 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the elodie spectra were automatically reduced on - line during the observations and the cross - correlation with a reference mask was produced as well .",
    "the observations carried out at catania observatory have been performed in 2001 and 2002 with the reosc echelle spectrograph at the 91-cm telescope .",
    "the spectrograph is fed by the telescope through an optical fiber ( uv - nir , @xmath15 core diameter ) and is placed in a stable position in the room below the dome level .",
    "spectra were recorded on a ccd camera equipped with a thinned back - illuminated site ccd of 1024@xmath161024 pixels ( size 24@xmath1624 @xmath17 m ) .",
    "the chelle crossed configuration yields a resolution of about 14000 , as deduced from the fwhm of the lines of the th - ar calibration lamp .",
    "the observations have been made in the red region .",
    "the detector allows us to record five orders in each frame , spanning from about 5860 to 6700   .",
    "the oac data reduction was performed by using the echelle task of iraf package following the standard steps : background subtraction , division by a flat field spectrum given by a halogen lamp , wavelength calibration using the emission lines of a th - ar lamp , and normalization to the continuum through a polynomial fit .",
    "the photometric observations have been carried out in 2001 and 2002 in the standard @xmath0 system also with the 91-cm telescope of oac and a photon - counting refrigerated photometer equipped with an emi 9789qa photomultiplier , cooled to @xmath18c .",
    "the dark noise of the detector , operated at this temperature , is about @xmath19 photon / sec .    for each field of the rastyc sources , we have chosen two or three stars with known @xmath20 magnitudes to be used as local standards for the determination of the photometric instrumental ",
    "zero points \" . additionally , several standard stars , selected from the list of landolt ( @xcite ) , were also observed during the run in order to determine the transformation coefficients to the johnson standard system .    a typical observation consisted of several integration cycles ( from 1 to 3 , depending on the star brightness ) of 10 , 5 , 5 seconds , in the @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 filter , respectively .",
    "a 21@xmath24 diaphragm was used .",
    "the data were reduced by means of the photometric data reduction package phot designed for photoelectric photometry of catania observatory ( @xcite ) .",
    "seasonal mean extinction coefficient for serra la nave observatory were adopted for the atmospheric extinction correction .",
    "radial velocities for oac spectra were obtained by cross - correlation of each echelle spectral order of the rastyc spectra with that of bright radial velocity standard stars . for this purpose the iraf task fxcor , that computes rvs by means of the cross - correlation technique , was used .",
    "the wavelength ranges for the cross - correlation were selected to exclude the h@xmath1 and nai d@xmath25 lines , which are contaminated by chromospheric emission and have very broad wings .",
    "the spectral regions heavily affected by telluric lines ( e.g. the o@xmath25 lines in the @xmath26 region ) were also excluded .",
    "the observed rv curves are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : rv ] , where , for sb2 systems , we used dots for the rvs of primary ( more massive ) components and open circles for those secondary ( less massive ) ones .",
    "we initially searched for eccentric orbits and found in any case very low eccentricity values ( e.g. @xmath27 for hd  183957 , @xmath28 for 221428 ) .",
    "thus , following the precepts of @xcite , we adopted @xmath29 .",
    "the circular solutions are also represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : rv ] with solid and dashed lines for the primary and secondary components , respectively .    the orbital parameters of the systems , orbital period ( @xmath30 ) , barycentric velocity ( @xmath6 ) , rv semi - amplitudes ( @xmath7 ) and masses ( @xmath8 ) , are listed in table  [ tab : param ] , where p and s refer to the primary and secondary components of the sb2 systems , respectively .    with the only exception of hd  183957 , for which any modulation is visible neither in oac data nor in tycho @xmath31 magnitudes ,",
    "all sources show a photometric modulation well correlated with the orbital period , indicating a high degree of synchronization .",
    "the low amplitude of the light curve of 215940 and the very low values of @xmath8 imply a very low inclination of orbital / rotational axis .      for sb1 systems observed with elodie",
    "we have determined effective temperatures and gravity ( i.e. spectral classification ) by means of the tgmet code , available at ohp ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have also used rotfit , a code written by one of us ( @xcite ) in idl ( interactive data language , rsi ) , which simultaneously find the spectral type and the @xmath3 of the target by searching , into a library of standard star spectra , for the standard spectrum which gives the best match of the target one , after the rotational broadening . as standard star library , we used a sub - sample of the stars of the tgmet list whose spectra were retrieved from the elodie archive ( @xcite ) .",
    "the rotfit code was also applied to the oac spectra , using standard star spectra acquired with the same instrument .",
    "this was especially advantageous for df  cam , for which we have no elodie spectrum .",
    "for sb2 systems we made a preliminary classification on the basis of a visual inspection of elodie and oac spectra .",
    "however , we are developing a code for spectral type determination in double - lined binaries which will allow us to improve the spectral classification .",
    "we found at least two binaries composed by main sequence stars , while the remaining systems contain an evolved ( giant or sub - giant ) star .",
    "measurements of @xmath3 were also made using the elodie ccfs and the calibration relation between ccf width and @xmath3 proposed by @xcite .",
    "the lower rotation rate ( @xmath324 kms@xmath11 ) has been detected for both components of hd  183957 , which display also the lowest h@xmath1 activity among the six sources .",
    "the h@xmath1 line is an important indicator of chromospheric activity .",
    "only the very active stars show always h@xmath1 emission above the continuum , while in less active stars only a filled - in absorption line is observed .",
    "the detection of the chromospheric emission contribution filling in the line core is hampered in double - lined systems in which both spectra are simultaneously seen and shifted at different wavelengths , according to the orbital phase .",
    "therefore a comparison with an `` inactive '' template built up with two stellar spectra that mimic the two components of the system in absence of activity is needed to emphasize the h@xmath1 chromospheric emission .",
    "the inactive templates have been built up with rotationally broadened elodie archive spectra ( hd  10476 , k1v for both components of hd  183957 ; @xmath6  cep , k1iv for 102623 ; @xmath33  boo , g8iii for 072133 ; hd  17382 , k1v for 215940 ) or with oac spectra of @xmath1  ari ( k2iii ) , for df  cam , acquired during the observing campaigns .",
    "the two components of hd 183957 show only a small filling of their h@xmath1 profiles ( fig .",
    "[ fig : halpha2 ] ) , while the other rastyc stars display h@xmath1 emission profiles with a variety of shapes , going from a simple symmetric emission profile ( 102623 ) to a double - peaked strong emission line ( 215940 ) .",
    "it has been also observed a very broad , complex feature with a filled - in core and an emission blue wing ( 072133 ) . a h@xmath1 profile similar to that displayed by the latter star has been sometimes observed in some long - period rs cvn s , like hk lac ( e.g. catalano & frasca 1994 ) .",
    "rastyc 072133 was classified as a semi - regular variable after hipparcos , but it displays all the characteristics of a rs  cvn sb1 binary .",
    "the elodie spectra of 221428 in the h@xmath1 region show that the secondary ( less massive ) component displays a h@xmath1 line always in emission with a stronger intensity around phase 0@xmath347 .",
    "the oac spectra of df  cam always display a pure h@xmath1 emission line , whose intensity varies with the orbital / rotational phase . similarly to 072133 , df  cam , considered as a semi - regular variable after hipparcos photometry , is very likely an active binary of the rs  cvn or by  dra class .",
    "the equivalent width of the lithium @xmath356708 line , @xmath36 , was measured on the elodie spectra .",
    "for the three sources for which we were able to detect and measure @xmath36 , we deduced lithium abundance , @xmath37 , in the range 1.31.8 , according to @xcite nlte calculations .",
    "we are grateful to the members of the staff of ohp and oac observatories for their support and help with the observations .",
