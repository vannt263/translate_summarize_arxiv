    "several large interferometric gravitational wave detectors @xcite will soon be operating , perhaps to be joined by several as or more sensitive acoustic resonant detectors @xcite in the years to come .",
    "there are several reasons for wanting to combine , in some way the , the data from these detectors in order to draw inferences about the presence of a signal or the parameters that characterize it : for example , observations of a signal with several detectors increase the degree of confidence in the detection and characterization of a signal , and the use of several geographically separated detectors can allow one to disentangle source parameters ( e.g. , sky position , polarization ) that are degenerate when observed in a single detector .",
    "the signal response of both interferometric and acoustic detectors is sensitive to the phase of the incident gravitational waves ; consequently , we have the opportunity to combine interfere the response of several detectors , synthesizing a single , effectively larger and more directionally sensitive detector : in short , aperture synthesis . here",
    "we describe a likelihood - based analysis for the detection of a signal of known , parameterized form in the joint output of a network of detectors .",
    "such an analysis makes the most effective use of the information available from each detector , in exactly the same sense that optimal filter described in @xcite is best - suited for detecting or characterizing radiation incident on a single detector .",
    "the analysis described here stands in contrast to a `` coincidence '' analysis , whereby `` events '' are identified independently in separate detectors and these independent lists of events are later brought together and compared for coincidences @xcite .",
    "the key difference between the two analyses is their sensitivity to inter - detector correlations .",
    "the response of a network of gravitational wave detectors to an incident plane wave is phase coherent .",
    "this phase coherence is captured in the likelihood function describing the output of a network of detectors ; however , it is absent in a coincidence analysis .",
    "this leads the likelihood analysis to have an increased detection efficiency for a given false alarm rate when compared to a coincidence analysis searching for the same signals and based on the same detector output .",
    "we demonstrate this directly in a set of three numerical examples , based on a network consisting of two separated detectors . in each example",
    "we search for a signal of known waveform arriving at an arbitrary time and from an arbitrary direction .",
    "two different search algorithms are investigated .",
    "the first is based on the maximum of the likelihood of the joint detector output ; the second is based on the analysis of coincidences between the optimally filtered output of each detector , considered separately .",
    "the three examples differ in the character of the simulated noise : in the examples the noise is either normal , strongly leptokurtic or strongly platykurtic . in all cases",
    "the likelihood analysis described here gives a substantially larger detection efficiency for a fixed false alarm rate .",
    "most previous work on multi - detector gravitational wave data analysis has focused on coincidence analyses or variations on coincidence analyses @xcite that occur separately at each detector . the work described here parallels recent , independent work by bose and collaborators @xcite .",
    "it goes beyond that work by allowing from the beginning detectors that are not coincident and accommodating the possibility that the noise between pairs of detectors may be correlated .",
    "section [ sec : nomenclature ] introduces terminology and nomenclature used throughout this work . in section",
    "[ sec : gauss ] the likelihood function for the joint output of a set of gravitational wave detectors is derived .",
    "the form derived here is exact when the detector noise is normal ; however , we show that it is also the best choice ( in the sense of making the least additional assumptions about the noise statistics ) when only the detector cross- and auto - correlations are known . in section [ sec : examples ] we describe and present the results of several numerical examples , meant to compare likelihood and coincidence - based approaches to data analysis .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "while gravitational wave detectors are analog devices , the detector output , including diagnostic channels containing physical and environmental monitors , will be quantized in magnitude and sampled discretely in time .",
    "data analysis will operate exclusively with this discrete time series .",
    "properly handled , quantization of the continuous amplitude contributes a small , white , additive component to the detector noise ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 3.7.3 ) , which we will not discuss further here .    when certain other conditions hold , the continuous in time and discretely sampled time series are equivalent and fully interchangeable . in this paper",
    "we have occasion to refer to both discrete and continuous time representations of the same underlying process . to distinguish between these two representations",
    ", we refer to the continuous time representation of the process @xmath0 by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes continuous time , and the discrete time representation of the same process by @xmath3 $ ] , where integer @xmath4 denotes the sample number .      for our purposes ,",
    "the output of a single gravitational - wave detector is a real , scalar - valued time series .",
    "an important purpose of this paper is to discuss data analysis for a gravitational - wave _ receiver , _ by which we mean a logical collection of detectors .",
    "the output of a receiver is a vector - valued time series .",
    "the elements of the vector at any given sample are the detector outputs at the corresponding moment of time .    in this paper we will have occasion to refer to scalar- , vector- and matrix - valued time series . to distinguish between these different cases , we use a lowercase italic face ( as in @xmath5 ) to denote scalars or scalar - valued sequences , a lowercase bold - italic face ( as in @xmath6 ) to denote vectors or vector sequences , and an uppercase bold - italic face ( as in @xmath7 ) to denote matrices or matrix - valued sequences ( functions ) .",
    "many different conventions for the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) can be found in the literature .",
    "we adopt the conventions described in this section .",
    "if you compare the notation used here with other conventions found in the literature , it will be to your advantage to pay careful attention to the normalization , index range of the input and output sequences , and sign convention of the transform kernel .",

    "the kernel of the transform , @xmath14 , satisfies an orthogonality relationship , @xmath15 as @xmath4 and @xmath16 run from @xmath17 to @xmath18 ; consequently , the dft is invertible .",

    "a wealth of useful results and insights into the dft / idft pair are found in @xcite ; additionally , @xcite discusses the use of the dft / idft pair in digital signal processing .      a _ receiver _ is a collection of one or more individual gravitational - wave _ detectors _",
    "whose output is analyzed collectively to draw a single set of inferences regarding the presence and properties of radiation sources .",
    "the elements of the receiver are the detectors , which need not be co - located , co - oriented , or of identical design , sensitivity or bandwidth . for example , a single receiver might consist of    * the three ligo interferometers ( a 4  km and a 2  km interferometer in washington state , usa , and a 4  km interferometer interferometer in louisiana , usa ) @xcite , * the virgo interferometer ( located in pisa , italy @xcite ) , * the geo-600 interferometer ( located in hannover , germany @xcite ) , * the tama-300 interferometer ( located in tokyo , japan @xcite ) , * the allegro detector ( a resonant mass detector located in louisiana @xcite ) , * the auriga detector ( a resonant mass detector located in padua @xcite ) , * the explorer detector ( a resonant mass detector located in frascati @xcite ) , and * the nautilus detector ( a resonant mass detector located in geneva @xcite ) .",

    "the output @xmath25 of a receiver composed of several detectors @xmath26 is the direct sum of the output of the individual detectors : @xmath27    the receiver response @xmath28 to an incident gravitational - wave @xmath29 depends on parameters @xmath30 that reflect both the intrinsic properties of the source and the relationship of the source to the receiver ( i.e. , distance and orientation ) .",
    "for example , if the source is a stochastic gravitational - wave signal , then @xmath30 describes the signal spectrum and anisotropy ; alternatively , if the source is an inspiraling compact binary system , then @xmath30 describes the binary s component masses , spins and orbital characteristics . in this paper",
    "i discuss analysis for deterministic signals : i.e. , signals like those that arise from binary inspiral or rapidly rotating non - axisymmetric neutron stars , whose waveform can be accurately described in terms of a small number of parameters that characterize the source and its orientation with respect to the detector .",
    "let @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote alternative , exclusive hypotheses regarding the presence or absence of a signal :    @xmath33    where @xmath30 represents a set of parameters that differentiate signals in the detector : for example , if the signal is from an inspiraling binary neutron star or black hole system , the parameters include the component masses and the source distance from and orientation with respect to the receiver . in this section",
    "we derive the likelihood function @xmath34 , describing the probability that @xmath25 is observed under the hypothesis @xmath32 .    why the likelihood function ?",
    "recall that the likelihood is any function that , viewed as a function of @xmath30 , is proportional to @xmath35 , the probability of observing @xmath25 given the fixed hypothesis @xmath32 . in a bayesian analysis , the goal is to determine or characterize @xmath36 , the probability of the hypothesis given the observation . through bayes",

    "the likelihood plays a central role and no other function of the observation and hypotheses offers the prospect of stronger statements .",
    "in our derivation of the likelihood we assume that the noise in each detector is gaussian and stationary .",
    "while the fundamental noise sources in gravitational wave detectors are all characterized by gaussian - stationary statistics , the realities of an actual implementation  e.g. , detector imperfections and environmental couplings  guarantee that the actual noise character will be neither gaussian nor stationary .",
    "characterizing the detector , which includes identifying instrumental and environmental artifacts in the `` gravity - wave channel '' and regressing or removing these artifacts to the greatest possible extent , is a necessary pre - requisite to the analysis of the data for gravitational waves .",
    "we assume here that these artifacts have already been dealt with as best possible , so that @xmath25 contains no identifiable instrumental artifacts , transient or otherwise , and that the noise is stationary on timescales long compared to the duration of a signal .",
    "even so , the noise will remain non - gaussian and non - stationary .",
    "as long as the evolution of the noise character is adiabatic  i.e. , it varies only on timescales long compared to the signal duration and the time required to estimate the moments of the noise distribution  we can treat the noise as stationary on any important sub - interval .",
    "it is also an excellent approximation to treat the noise as gaussian . to see why ,",

    "what probability distribution makes the least assumptions about the process while remaining consistent with this information ?",
    "this information - theoretic question has a definite answer : it is the probability distribution @xmath42 with maximum entropy , subject to the constraints on its mean and variance : i.e. , the distribution @xmath43 that maximizes the functional @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the lagrange multipliers corresponding to the constraints on the overall normalization of the probability , the mean and the variance .",

    "we choose a particular normalization of the likelihood function , as the ratio of @xmath55 to the probability that @xmath25 arises from detector noise alone .",

    "real signals , however , are not so constrained . nevertheless , if the observation is properly sampled ( i.e. , sampled without aliasing ) , then all of the power in the receiver response is at frequencies much less than the nyquist frequency @xmath248 , which is half the sample rate . in that case @xmath249 , where @xmath250 denotes the receiver response to a signal whose initial wavefront arrives at the network at time @xmath2 , can not vary significantly for @xmath251 less than several times @xmath252 ; correspondingly , the likelihood will remain peaked about the @xmath231 nearest to the actual signal arrival time and the corresponding signal to noise will differ only slightly from its maximum value .    in step [ step :",

    "there are three local maxima associated with the likelihood function .",

    "the result is a list of events , all above threshold , in which no two events can have resulted from the same gravitational - wave signal .",
    "finally , we justify the use of @xmath124 as the point estimate of the signal parameters characterizing the detected signal .",
    "suppose that a signal characterized by fixed @xmath253 is incident on an ensemble of identical receivers .",
    "the corresponding ensemble of @xmath124 has as its mode @xmath253 ; consequently , a natural estimator for @xmath253 is the @xmath124 arising from a particular observation .",
    "in the maximum likelihood rule , when we conclude that a signal is present we take @xmath124 as our point - estimate of the signal parameters .",
    "much discussed in the context of gravitational - wave data analysis is an apparently simpler analysis , referred to generally as `` coincidence . ''",
    "this test has received its most precise definition in @xcite for the particular case of binary inspiral observations .",
    "in general , coincidence tests involve a complete analysis at each individual detector , considered in isolation from all other detectors in the receiver .",
    "the result of these individual analyses is a set of `` candidate - event lists '' , one for each detector , which consist of `` detections '' at each detector together with estimators for the signal start time and other signal parameters that can be determined from observations in a single detector .",
    "real gravitational - wave events should excite the several different detectors in a self - consistent manner : in particular , the signal start times should be consistent with the light travel time between the detectors and other signal parameters should be consistent with a unique source .",
    "the consistency requirement is difficult to pin - down .",
    "for example , in the case of our own model detector and source , consistency would appear to require that the signal arrival times are consistent with the signal propagation time between the detectors and that the measured signal amplitudes be equal .",
    "owing to detector noise , however , the estimated signal amplitudes will only approximate the actual amplitudes , and similarly for the signal start times and other parameters . for signal amplitudes , then , a window of some breadth must be defined and signal candidates whose amplitudes fall within the window are assumed to arise from a real signal .",
    "the choice of window , its implementation and the procedure for combining separate estimates of common parameters all affect the false alarm and false dismissal fractions that characterize the test .",
    "the problem is more complicated in the case of an estimated source location .",
    "consider a real signal , incident on the detectors from a direction nearly perpendicular to the axis between them .",
    "let the measured start time @xmath216 on the @xmath215 detector be @xmath254 where @xmath255 is the actual moment when the signal is incident on the @xmath215 detector and @xmath256 is the error in the estimated start time owing to detector noise .",
    "the difference in the measured signal start times is @xmath257 where @xmath208 is the direction cosine describing the radiation s propagation direction and @xmath258 is the difference between the errors in the measured start times .",
    "when a real signal is incident along , or nearly along , the axis ( @xmath259 ) , then small errors @xmath260 can lead to @xmath261 , which we would regard as unphysical and not representative of a real signal . on the other hand , when @xmath262 is much less than unity , the same errors will leave us with @xmath263 still much less than unity , in which case we accept the coincidence as representing a real signal . to minimize this false rejection of real signals",
    "we can adopt a window broader than the light travel time between the detectors for comparing signal arrival times ( taking the estimated arrival direction to be along the axis if the difference of arrival times would suggest @xmath264 greater than unity ) ; however , in doing so we also increase the false alarm rate , reducing the discriminating power of the test .",
    "the sign of the error also plays an important role : when @xmath258 has the same sign as @xmath208 we are more likely to reject a real signal than when they have opposite signs .",
    "the fraction of signals rejected can thus depend in a complicated way on the interaction between the underlying signal parameters , the windows , and the allowable range of the parameters that characterize the signal .    in the spirit of @xcite",

    "the natural estimators for the latter two quantities are    [ eq : combinedestimators ] @xmath291    the geometry of our model problem suggests no particular procedure for combining the separate signal amplitude estimates into an overall estimate for the network .",
    "one procedure that has been recommended @xcite is to form the final estimate as the root mean square of the point estimates :    @xmath292    where @xmath293    this prescription will consistently overestimate the amplitude of the signal . for any given observation of a signal with amplitude @xmath211 , the estimate in the detector @xmath215 is equal to @xmath211 plus a random variable : @xmath294 if the detector noise is gaussian then @xmath295 is gaussian .",
    "the mean square of the point estimates is thus @xmath296 the mean of @xmath297 , or of @xmath298 , will thus be greater than @xmath211 .",
    "a similar problem will plague any attempt to form network estimates of parameters from parameters that are overdetermined by the network ( for example , network - wide estimates of @xmath299 or @xmath235 from three or more detectors ) .",
    "an unbiased estimate for @xmath211 is the straightforward average of the parameter values , which we adopt here :    [ eq : ajcoinc ] @xmath300 where @xmath301    several aspects of this procedure for detecting a signal coincident in two detectors and estimating the parameters characteristic of the source deserve special attention :    [ [ candidate - signals . ] ] candidate signals .",

    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    when the noise distribution is gaussian , the error in the estimator of the signal arrival time at a particular detector is also gaussian .",
    "consequently it might be thought that the error in the estimators @xmath302 and @xmath303 are also normal , since they arise from the combination of normal errors in two detectors whose noise is normal , and that the estimators @xmath302 and @xmath303 are unbiased .",
    "( this is the claim is made in @xcite . )",
    "as discussed above , however , the errors in the @xmath304 are correlated by the procedure we used to create the coincident detection list : for radiation whose propagation direction is nearly aligned with the axis between the detectors , insisting that @xmath305 be less than @xmath205 causes us to favor those signals for which the errors in @xmath306 and @xmath290 are positively correlated .",
    "the estimator @xmath307 in equation [ eq : coincestx ] is thus biased to underestimate the magnitude of the propagation direction cosine ; additionally , signals whose propagation direction cosine is large ( i.e. , signals propagated along or nearly along the axis ) have larger false dismissal fractions than signals propagating normal to the axis .

    "[ signal - strength . ] ] signal strength .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in the maximum likelihood test described above , signal strength is described by a single quantity : the s / n , which is equal to the log maximum likelihood .",
    "this measure of signal strength has the desired property that , as the detection threshold is increased , weaker signals are no longer considered to be detected before stronger signals . in the coincidence test , there are two different `` signal - to - noise '' ratios  one for each detector  and neither , by itself , is sufficient to determine that a signal is present .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that the `` natural '' signal strength for coincidence tests is the sum of the amplitude - squared s / n for the different detectors : in this case @xmath308 this definition has the undesirable property that `` stronger '' signals ( i.e. , those with larger @xmath309 ) are not necessarily more likely to be detected than weaker ones .",
    "in particular , as the detection thresholds are raised at the two detectors , signals disappear from the coincident detection list _ when the weakest member of the pair @xmath310 falls below the threshold in the @xmath215 detector , _ which is not when @xmath202 falls below threshold .",
    "if we want signal strength to have the property that , as the detection threshold is increased , weaker signals disappear from the detection list before stronger ones then the appropriate measure of signal strength is the _ _ minimum of @xmath311 and @xmath312 : _ _",

    "false alarm frequency @xmath318 is the limiting frequency of `` signal detection '' when , in fact , no signal is actually present . to determine @xmath318 as a function of the threshold @xmath319 we use a statistical model of the receiver noise to generate many pseudo - random instances of @xmath25 representative of receiver noise alone .",
    "the false alarm frequency is then the average number of `` detections '' per unit time .",
    "a convenient , dimensionless representation of the false alarm frequency is the average number of false signals detected per sample @xmath230 $ ] : @xmath320 where @xmath321 is the sample rate .",
    "we refer to @xmath23 as the false alarm fraction ; by our procedure @xmath23 is strictly less than or equal to unity and can be regarded as the probability of a false detection on a per - sample basis .",
    "the false dismissal frequency @xmath314 of an inference rule is the limiting frequency with which the rule reports that no signal is present when , in fact , a signal is present ; thus , @xmath314 is a function of the signal ( or the signal population ) .",
    "another way to think about @xmath314 is as the detection efficiency : @xmath322 is the fraction of actual signals that the detection procedure will identify . to find @xmath314 we generate many pseudo - random instances of receiver noise and add to them a specific signal .",
    "the result is many instances of @xmath25 corresponding to observations of that source .",

    "the false dismissal frequency depends on the distribution of signals in the signal population ; for simplicity , we assume that all signals in the population have the same unknown amplitude @xmath211 and sky location @xmath208 , which are given in the first column of table [ tbl : beta ] .",
    "( more realistically the amplitude @xmath234 depends inversely on the distance to the source , its orientation with respect to the detector , and other parameters .",
    "corresponding to the source distribution in space and the other parameters is a distribution for @xmath234 . requiring that @xmath23 not exceed a certain value sets a threshold @xmath229 , regardless of this distribution .",
    "the false dismissal frequency @xmath314 , on the other hand , depends on this distribution in a straightforward way . )",
    "figure [ fig : gab ] shows @xmath322 as a function of @xmath23 for the maximum likelihood and coincidence detection procedures when used to detect signals of this character in our model receiver . in these monte carlo simulations we count as a false dismissal all signal identifications ( whether by the coincidence or maximum likelihood test ) where the identified start time @xmath324 differs from the actual start time by more than the signal duration , or where the identified sky position @xmath316 differs from actual sky position by more than the signal duration divided by the detector separation .",
    "this condition is necessary if `` correct detections '' by either rule are to include only those candidate events with non - zero signal power . for all @xmath23 ,",
    "the maximum likelihood test has a substantially higher detection efficiency @xmath322 than the coincidence test ; consequently , its performance is substantially better than the coincidence test .",
    "the better performance of the maximum likelihood test holds independent of the actual signal parameters , though it is more significant for weak signals than for strong ones .",
    "it is , however , these weak signals  those just above threshold  that determine the overall efficiency of the detector . for astrophysical burst sources , which are most likely distributed cosmologically and hence isotropically ,",
    "the s / n @xmath325 is inversely proportional to the source distance ; consequently , the number of sources `` brighter '' than the threshold @xmath326 is proportional to @xmath327 . of these , a fraction @xmath328 are `` dimmer '' than @xmath329 , where @xmath330 half of all events whose expected s / n is greater than @xmath326 have s / n less than @xmath331 .",
    "thus , if the false dismissal fraction is large when measured for events at threshold , it will be large when measured over all events .",
    "note also in figure [ fig : gab ] that the false dismissal fraction for the coincidence test asymptotes to a non - zero value as the false alarm frequency increases ( corresponding to a lower threshold @xmath326 ) : i.e. , even at zero - threshold there are false dismissals .",
    "the asymptote depends on the signal for which the false dismissal frequency is computed : it is lower for stronger signals and higher for weaker ones .",
    "the non - zero asymptote for the coincidence test originates in the process that selects candidate events in each detector . in the coincidence test ,",
    "a false alarm event that occurs close in time to a real signal event can mask that real event if it has a higher s / n ( cf .  coincidence test step  [ step : cselect ] ) .",
    "the false alarm may be sufficiently different than the signal event it masked that , when an attempt is made to pair it with a candidate event in the other detectors ( cf .",
    "coincidence test step [ step : cpair ] ) , the test concludes that no signal is present at all ; alternatively , the test may identify a signal at a point in the sky or with a start time so different from the actual location or start time that the identification must be regarded as a false alarm and not a signal detection .",
    "the same mechanism also operates in the maximum likelihood test ( cf.maximum likelihood test step  [ step : prune ] ) ; however , that test is much less sensitive to this effect .",
    "in particular , noise events that would cause a masking false alarm in the coincidence test do not lead to a large s / n in the maximum likelihood test since there the s / n is suppressed when the detector - detector _ cross - correlation _ is not consistent with a real signal .",
    "the difference in the relative performance of the maximum likelihood and coincidence tests is directly traceable to the different ways in which each test requires consistency in the response of the different detectors : in the maximum likelihood test the _ relative _ response of the assembled detectors is required to be consistent with the incidence of a single wavefront on the receiver , while in the coincidence test the individual response of each detector is represented in just a few parameters and an _ ad hoc _ consistency is imposed only on the relative value of these parameters , _ none of which sample the correlated response of the several detectors in the receiver .",
    "_      the example just given is in the context of noise uncorrelated between the two detectors .",
    "how do the coincidence and correlation test fare when the noise in the several receiver detectors is correlated ?    in the context of the coincidence test , correlated noise leads to an increase in the overall false alarm frequency as noise events leading to a candidate event in one detector are correlated with noise events leading to a candidate in the other detector .",
    "no means of distinguishing between these new false alarms , which arise from the noise cross - correlation , and correlations arising from signals is possible in a coincidence test ; consequently , the only way that the correlated noise can be accommodated is by an increase in the thresholds applied to the output of each detector .",
    "this increases the false dismissal fraction , leading to an overall worsening of the test s performance .",
    "the likelihood function , on the other hand , directly accommodates correlated noise in a precise manner . in the context of the maximum likelihood test ,",
    "noise correlated between the detectors means that the @xmath91 $ ] are no longer diagonal ; however , as we have seen ( cf .",
    "[ sec : fast < a , b > ] ) this poses no analysis problems in either principle or practice . by construction , then , the maximum likelihood test distinguishes inter - detector correlations whose spectrum is characteristics of a real signal from inter - detector correlations that are characteristic of correlated detector noise .",
    "consequently , when noise is correlated between the receiver s detectors we expect the maximum likelihood test to perform still better than the coincidence test .",
    "equation [ eq : lambdadetsig ] describes the likelihood function only when the receiver noise is gaussian .",
    "the noise in a real detector will be , at some level , non - gaussian and non - stationary : some fundamental contributions to the noise may be intrinsically non - gaussian , some contributions may be intrinsically gaussian but appear non - gaussian in the output owing to non - linearities in the receiver s response , and some contributions will reflect the environment that the detector finds itself in .",
    "we have already shown that , lacking detailed knowledge of the higher order moments of the detector noise distribution , a normal distribution is the the best approximation to a noise distribution whose mean and variance are known ( cf .",
    "[ sec : likeintro ] ) .",
    "we refer to this as the gaussian - approximation likelihood function .",
    "we expect that the maximum likelihood test will still outperform the coincidence test , since it is still the case that the correlation analysis described in section  [ sec : correlation ] is sensitive to the coherent response of a receiver s component detectors to a real signal in ways that the coincidence analysis described in section  [ sec : coincidence ] is not .",
    "coincidence tests misidentify as signals coincident non - gaussian noise events as readily as they do coincident gaussian noise events , while a gaussian - approximation likelihood test reject non - gaussian events that are inconsistent with an incident plane gravitational wave as easily as they do inconsistent gaussian events .",
    "thus , we expect in general that the detection efficiency for fixe false alarm fraction will be greater for a test based on the gaussian - approximation likelihood test statistic than for a coincidence test based on the individual detector responses .    to demonstrate this point , we simulate non - gaussian noise according to two models  one strongly leptokurtic and one strongly platykurtic  and apply the coincidence and gaussian - approximation maximum likelihood tests described in sections [ sec : correlation ] and [ sec : coincidence ] to calculate the relationship between detection efficiency and false alarm fraction for a fixed signal .",
    "a convenient model for a stationary non - gaussian noise process is the _ mixture gaussian . _",
    "a mixture gaussian distribution has the form    @xmath332\\over \\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_{i}}\\\\ \\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_{i } & = & 1\\\\ p_{i } & > & 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    by appropriate choice of the constants @xmath333 , @xmath334 and @xmath335 a mixture gaussian can approximate any uncorrelated noise distribution through its first @xmath336 moments .",
    "the two distributions we model here are drawn from the mixture gaussian distributions described in table [ tbl : mixgaussdist ] .",
    "the corresponding probability distribution functions are shown graphically in figure [ fig : mixgaussdist ] .",
    "note that each is strongly non - gaussian , though in different ways .",
    "figures [ fig : lepto ] and [ fig : platy ] show the detection efficiency as a function of the false alarm frequency for the coincidence and gaussian - approximation maximum likelihood tests for the leptokurtic distribution and platykurtic distributions , respectively .",
    "the detection efficiency and false alarm fractions were determined by monte carlo simulations .",
    "the signal parameters used in the detection efficiency simulations are given in the second and third columns of table [ tbl : beta ] .",
    "the conclusion reached earlier  that the maximum likelihood test is superior to the coincidence test  is _ not sensitive _ to the approximation of gaussian noise .",
    "there is no qualitative difference between figures [ fig : lepto ] , [ fig : platy ] , and [ fig : gab ] , which summarize the relative characteristics of these two tests when the noise is strongly non - gaussian or gaussian . in all cases",
    "the detection efficiency of the ( gaussian - approximation ) maximum likelihood test is less than that of the coincidence test at the same false alarm fraction .",
    "the principal reason for this superior performance is the same here as in the case of gaussian noise : the response of two or more detectors to incident radiation is correlated , and the gaussian - approximation maximum likelihood test is sensitive to the expected inter - detector cross - correlations , reducing the s / n when the correlations are not consistent with waves from the same source .",
    "the output of several gravitational wave detectors can be combined , in a form of aperture synthesis , to form a single , more sensitive gravitational wave detector . here",
    "we describe such an analysis , based on the likelihood function , appropriate to the detection of a burst gravitational wave source , of known waveform , in a network of gravitational wave detectors .",
    "this likelihood analysis of the joint output of several detectors leads to the optimal matched filter for the output of the multi - detector network .",
    "the analysis presented here stands in contrast to `` coincidence '' analyses , where the output of each detector is studied separately to arrive at a list of events , which are then compared between the detectors to determine if there are any coincidences , which may be taken to be evidence for gravitational waves .",
    "the critical difference between these two analyses is that the likelihood is sensitive to the coherent response of the detector network to the incident signal .",
    "this leads the likelihood based analysis to have greater discriminating power than a coincidence analysis , as shown by a greater detection efficiency to false alarm frequency ratio .",
    "the importance of inter - detector correlations is clearly important when looking for a signal ; however , it is also important when the noise in two or more detectors is correlated .",
    "such correlations are naturally accommodated in the optimal filter developed here ; however , they can not be naturally accommodated in a coincidence analysis which , by its very nature , ignores inter - detector correlations .",
    "the likelihood function derived here begins with an assumption that the detector noise is gaussian - stationary ; however , the results obtained are much more general . we show that treating non - gaussian as if it were gaussian is , in a very well - defined sense , the most appropriate choice if the only available characterization of the noise is through its mean and correlation function .",
    "while it is sometimes claimed @xcite that coincidence is the only reasonable test when the noise is non - gaussian , we show in a series of numerical simulations that the even when the noise is strongly non - gaussian the likelihood test , treating the noise as if it were gaussian , outperforms the coincidence test as measured by the ratio of detection efficiency to false alarm fraction .",
    "a naive estimate of the computational cost of computing the matched filter for a network of detectors might suggest that the cost is proportional to the cube of the length of the time series and the number of detectors .",
    "if the calculation is properly organized , however , the cost is seen to be strictly proportional to the duration of the signal being sought and no more than the square of the number of detectors in the network .",
    "the work described here can be considered aperture synthesis specialized to the problem of searching for signals of finite duration whose waveform is known .",
    "the problem of searching for stochastic signals remains to be studied .",
    "true aperture synthesis  searching for fringes in the interfered output of several gravitational wave detectors  may well be the most sensitive means of searching for the truly unanticipated source and is a particularly promising direction for future research .",
