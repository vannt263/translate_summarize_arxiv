    "recent observations at the lhc strongly point towards the existence of a resonance which is compatible with a sm higgs @xcite , thus seeming to complete the sm picture .",
    "the putative higgs discovery would leave unsolved many long - standing issues related to the nature of fermion mass hierarchies ( yukawas are completely free parameters ) and to the higgs mass stability itself ( divergence of radiative corrections ) , which can probably be explained extending the sm to encompass new , yet undiscovered , states . dedicated experimental searches for vlqs",
    "have already been undertaken and will be improved in the next future , therefore a detailed understanding of the properties of vlqs is essential to drive and tune forthcoming analyses .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", vlqs have been introduced in many different models ; the most studied scenarios which predict the presence of vlqs can be divided into broad categories :    * _ composite higgs models : _ the ew symmetry breaking is driven by a condensate of the top quark and a vl singlet involving a see - saw mechanism between the two states @xcite ; * _ extra dimensions : _ excited partners of sm quarks belonging to heavier tiers of universal extra - dimensional scenarios are vector - like ; * _ gauging of the flavour group : _ vl fermions are required for anomaly cancellation and can play a role in the mechanisms of quark mass generation @xcite ; * _ little higgs models : _ vl states appear as partners of sm fermions in larger representations of the symmetry group @xcite . * _ supersymmetric non - minimal extensions of the sm : _ vl matter can be introduced in non minimal supersymmetric models to increase corrections the higgs mass without affecting too much ew precision observables @xcite , and it appears also in non - minimal , gut - inspired , supersymmetric scenarios @xcite .",
    "vlqs can also appear in models which try to explain measured asymmetries in different processes .",
    "* in @xcite vlqs are introduced to explain the observed @xmath7 asymmetry : bottom partners can mix with the bottom quark and induce modifications of its coupling with the z boson . * the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath8 in top pair production , measured at tevatron ,",
    "can be explained with the existence of a color octet with a large decay width ; this condition can be obtained if the color octet is allowed to decay to a heavy vl state and a sm fermion @xcite .    from the phenomenological point of view",
    ", signatures of vlqs have been largely analysed in literature , both from a model independent perspective and within specific scenarios .",
    "the presence of flavour changing neutral currents , a distinctive feature of vlqs , leads to a wide range of possible final states , which have been ( and will certainly be ) analysed in detail in order to drive the experimental search of these new states .",

    "[ sect : model ] the minimal extension of the sm with the presence of vlqs is described , together with an overview of observables which can provide bounds to the mixing parameters of the theory ; sect .",

    "[ sect : signatures ] a list of all allowed final states coming from vlq resonant production in two - body intermediate states at the lhc is presented , considering all the possible decay channels for the different vlq representations ; moreover , specific signatures , analysed in literature , are shortly described ; in sect .",
    "[ sect : vlqcontributions ] some examples of the possible contribution of vlqs to other observables is discussed .",
    "some of the results reported here were published in refs .  @xcite .",

    "vl states are allowed to mix with sm quarks : the mixing occurs in the left - handed sector for the singlet and triplet representations and in the right - handed sector for the doublet representation .",
    "the mass eigenstates will be labelled as : @xmath10 the mass matrices for the sm - partners @xmath11 and @xmath12 can be diagonalized by unitary @xmath13 matrices @xmath14 and @xmath15 : @xmath16 where the actual expressions of @xmath17 and @xmath18 depend on the chosen representations and on the assumptions on the mixing parameters .",
    "the couplings with gauge bosons also depend on the chosen representations , but a common feature of every vlq scenario is that tree - level fcncs are developed through the mixing with sm quarks . the general form of @xmath19 couplings with the presence of vlqs is : @xmath20 where @xmath21 run on all quarks , including vlqs , @xmath22 is the weak isospin of top or bottom in the sm , and @xmath23 are parameters which depend on the vlq representation and satisfy the relation @xmath24 ; they are listed in tab .",

    "2 .   even flavour conserving neutral currents ( @xmath26 ) are modified by the presence of vlqs .",
    "constraints on fcncs coming from a large number of observations can therefore provide strong bounds on mixing parameters .",
    "charged currents are modified too .",
    "the general form of @xmath27 couplings with the presence of vlqs is : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and the matrices @xmath30 may or may not be present depending on the scenario considered . the matrices @xmath31 are defined as : @xmath32 where the lines mean that the size of the matrices depend on the chosen scenario ; in particular , @xmath33 exists only if both an up- and down - type vlq are present simultaneously .",

    "if vlqs exist , the measured @xmath36 matrix corresponds to the @xmath37 block @xmath38 , with @xmath39 .",
    "a further consequence of the introduction of vlqs is that the measured @xmath40 @xmath36 block is not unitary , and it is possible to check that deviations from unitarity are proportional to the mixing between sm quarks and vl states .",

    "the presence of new states induces corrections to precisely measured observables of the sm both at tree level and at loop level .",
    "tree level modifications are robust , in the sense that they can affect observables which in the sm are generated only at loop level and because they only depend on mixing parameters and new particles representations .",
    "loop corrections are more model - dependent : however , the presence of new heavy states can result in cancellations between diagrams which can sensibly change loop - level observables . in the following a short review of the main observables which can provide constraints on the mixing parameters of vlqs",

    "means that couplings of the type @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are sm quarks , receive deviations which can be observable in experimental searches . such deviations depend on the mixing parameters of the new states and on their representations , allowing the possibility to pose strong bounds on the coupling between vlqs and sm particles .    if the vlqs mix only with third generation sm quarks , the only affected observables are @xmath48 and @xmath49 ; since either the top or bottom quarks are mixed with the new states in all representations , the cc coupling @xmath48 is always affected at tree level by the presence of vlq , while the nc coupling @xmath49 is modified at tree level only if a @xmath12 vlq is present .",

    "<S> this work provides an overview on the current status of phenomenology and searches for heavy vector - like quarks , which are predicted in many models of new physics beyond the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> searches at tevatron and at the lhc , here listed and shortly described , have not found any evidence for new heavy fermionic states ( either chiral or vector - like ) , and have therefore posed strong bounds on their masses : depending on specific assumptions on the interactions and on the observed final state , vector - like quarks with masses up to roughly 400 - 600 gev have been excluded by all experiments . in order to be as simple and model - independent as possible , the chosen framework for the phenomenological analysis is an effective model with the addition of a vector - like quark representation ( singlet , doublet or triplet under @xmath0 ) which couples through yukawa interactions with all sm families . </S>",
    "<S> the relevance of different observables for the determination of bounds on mixing parameters is then discussed and a complete overview of possible two body final states for every vector - like quark is provided , including their subsequent decay into sm particles . a list and short description of phenomenological analyses present in literature is also provided for reference purposes .    </S>",
