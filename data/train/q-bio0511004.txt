    "the choice of the coordinates used to describe a molecule is an important issue if computational considerations are to be taken into account and the efficiency of the simulations is pursued .",
    "this choice also affects the coding of applications .",
    "if cumbersomely defined coordinates are used , an unnecessary complexity may be added to the design of monte carlo movements , the construction and pruning of a database of structures @xcite or the programming of molecular visualization and manipulation tools .",
    "suitable coordinates frequently used to describe arbitrary conformations of molecules are the so - called `` internal '' or `` valence - type '' coordinates @xcite .",
    "their adequacy stems from a number of characteristics : first , they are closely related to chemically meaningful structural parameters , such as bond lengths or bond angles ; second , they are local , in the sense that each one of them involves only a small number of ( normally close ) atoms in its definition ; and finally , there are only @xmath2 of them ( where @xmath3 is the number of atoms in the molecule ) , in such a way that the overall rotation and translation have been naturally removed",
    ".    there also exists a family of coordinates @xcite , extensively used in the inner calculations of many quantum chemistry packages ( such as gaussian @xcite or gamess @xcite ) and based on the `` natural internal coordinates '' originally proposed by pulay and coworkers @xcite , which are defined through linear combinations of the original internals .",
    "these coordinates are specially designed to describe normal - mode vibrations in the immediate neighbourhood of energy minima and represent the best choice for accelerating convergence of geometry optimizations in a particular basin of attraction , via diagonal estimation of the hessian matrix @xcite .",
    "accordingly , they maximally separate hard and soft movements in these conditions .",
    "however , if the conformation of the molecule is far from a minimum , this type of coordinates lose great part of their meaning and they introduce many computational difficulties without increasing the efficiency . also , some of the definitions are _ redundant _",
    "@xcite , i.e. , they use a number of coordinates larger than the number of degrees of freedom . in this work , we will only discuss coordinates , such as internals or cartesian , that may be conveniently used to specify an _ arbitrary _ conformation of the system and that can be directly related to simple geometrical variables .    in macromolecules , such as proteins , the number of degrees of freedom is the main limiting factor when one tries to predict their behaviour via computer modeling .",
    "therefore , it is also advisable that the set of coordinates chosen allows for a direct implementation of physically meaningful constraints that reduce the dimensionality of the conformational space considered .",
    "most of the expressions used in statistical mechanics or in molecular dynamics are best written in cartesian coordinates , however , the implementation of constraints naturally appearing is far from being straightforward in these coordinates . in internal coordinates , on the contrary , the approximate separation of hard and soft movements of the system allows to easily constrain the molecule @xcite by setting the hard coordinates ( those that require a considerable amount of energy to change noticeably ) to constant values or to particular functions of the soft coordinates .",
    "moreover , in internal coordinates ( and appealing to some reasonable approximations ) , the statistical mechanics formulae for the constrained system may be written in convenient closed form @xcite .    still , although the bond lengths and bond angles are customarily regarded as hard and their definition is unproblematic , the same is not true for dihedral angles .",
    "some definitions of dihedrals may lead to difficulties or to worse separation of hard and soft modes .",
    "let us exemplify this with a particular case :    consider the definition of z - matrix - like @xcite internal coordinates for the hco - l - ala - nh@xmath1 molecule in fig .",
    "[ fig : num_ala ] .",

    "the main difference with other z - matrix - like coordinates normally used in the literature @xcite is that , instead of positioning each atom with a bond length , a bond angle and a dihedral angle , we use normal dihedral angles ( called , from now on , `` principal dihedrals '' ) only to fix the orientation of whole groups and a somewhat non - standard type of dihedrals , termed `` phase dihedrals '' by r. abagyan and coworkers @xcite ( see fig .

    "in addition , the coordinates herein defined , are straightforwardly cast into z - matrix form and may be directly implemented in any quantum chemistry package , such as gaussian @xcite or gamess @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that , although they involve atoms whose covalent structure is different , the mathematical construction of the two types of angles in fig .",

    "if this does not lead to a decision , we proceed to the second neighbours and so on .",

    "@xcite ) :    @xmath109    the goodness of the approximation in this case is much due to the simplicity and small size of the side chain of the alanine residue and also to the fact that the dipeptide is isolated . for bulkier residues included in polypeptides , we expect the difference between @xmath81 and @xmath71 to be more important",
    "although the essential result is the one stated in the previous paragraphs , we wanted to look in more detail at the origin of the differences between @xmath81 and @xmath71 . for this",
    ", we have first subtracted from @xmath81 , @xmath110 and @xmath71 the same constant reference ( @xmath111)at the level of the theory used in the calculations , the minimum of @xmath81 in the grid is -414.7985507934 hartree . ] in order to render the numerical values more manageable and to minimize the statistical error of the @xmath112-intercept in the linear fits @xcite that will be made in the following .",
    "then , fitting @xmath110 against @xmath71 , we have found that they are more correlated than @xmath81 and @xmath71 ( compare the pearson s correlation coefficient , @xmath113 vs. @xmath114 , and the aforementioned distance , @xmath115 vs. @xmath116 ) , and that they are separated by an almost constant offset : @xmath71 is @xmath117 kcal / mol lower that @xmath110 ( on the other hand , @xmath71 is @xmath118 kcal / mol higher than @xmath81 ) .",
    "hence , the three ramachandran surfaces @xmath81 , @xmath110 and @xmath71 are very similar , except for an offset . in fig .  [",
    "fig : rama_plots]a , @xmath81 is depicted graphically and , in fig  [ fig : offsets ] , the relative offsets among the three energies are schematically shown .",
    "contrarily , the entropy ( we use @xmath119 in order to deal with quantities that have units of energy ) , which may be found in fig .  [",
    "fig : rama_plots]b , and whose average magnitude is @xmath120 kcal / mol , is almost uncorrelated with @xmath81 , @xmath110 and @xmath71 , being the correlation coefficients @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 , respectively .",
    "hence , given that @xmath124 is almost an order of magnitude lower than @xmath125 , it is reasonable to conclude that the greatest part of the ( little ) noise between @xmath81 and @xmath71 comes from the entropic term @xmath126 .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the difference @xmath127 is highly correlated with @xmath119 , being the correlation coefficient @xmath128 .",
    "finally , and in order to illustrate the better separation of the hard and soft modes achieved by the internal coordinates defined in this work , we have calculated the hessian matrix in the minimum @xmath101 ( also c7@xmath102 ) in two different sets of coordinates .",

    "[ fig : hessians ] , we present the sub - boxes of the two hessian matrices corresponding to the coordinates defined in tables  [ tab : good_coord ] and [ tab : bad_coord ] .    from the values shown",
    ", one can conclude that , in the `` properly defined coordinates '' , some convenient characteristics are present : on one side , the relatively low values of the elements @xmath129 and @xmath130 ( and their symmetric ones ) indicate that the soft degree of freedom @xmath0 and the hard ones @xmath131 and @xmath132 , which describe the internal structure of the methyl group , are uncoupled to a reasonable extent ; on the other side , the relatively low value of @xmath133 compared to @xmath134 and @xmath135 ( a difference of almost an order of magnitude ) proves that @xmath0 may be regarded as soft when compared to the hard degrees of freedom @xmath131 and @xmath132 .    on the contrary , in the `` ill - defined coordinates '' , the three dihedrals are hard , considerably coupled and equivalent .",
    "extending the approach of refs . @xcite and the ideas stated in @xcite , we have defined a systematic numeration of the groups , the atoms and the internal coordinates ( termed sasmic ) of organic molecules and , particularly , of polypeptide chains .",
    "the advantages of the rules herein presented are many - fold :    * the internal coordinates may be easily cast into conventional z - matrix form and they can be directly implemented into quantum chemical packages . * the algorithm for numbering allows for automatizing and facilitates the coding of computer applications . *",
    "the modularity of the numeration system in the case of polypeptides permits the addition of new residues without essentially changing the already numbered items .",
    "this is convenient if databases of peptide structures need to be designed .",
    "* the set of internal coordinates defined reasonably separate the hard and soft movements of organic molecules for arbitrary conformations using only topological information .",
    "a number of perl scripts that automatically generate these coordinates for polypeptide chains are provided as supplementary material .",

    "<S> coordinates normally used in the literature is that normal dihedral angles ( `` principal dihedrals '' in this work ) are only used to fix the orientation of whole groups and a somewhat non - standard type of dihedrals , termed `` phase dihedrals '' , are used to describe the covalent structure inside the groups . </S>",

    "<S> , we use the coordinates defined and ab initio quantum mechanical calculations to assess the commonly assumed approximation of the free energy , obtained from `` integrating out '' the side chain degree of freedom @xmath0 , by the potential energy surface ( pes ) in the protected dipeptide hco - l - ala - nh@xmath1 . </S>",
