    "the superfluid @xmath0he - a is a remarkable condensate with several broken symmetries and a variety of topological defects .",
    "it was proposed that many concepts and notions generated in the high energy particle physics can be tested in the earth bound ultra - low temperature laboratories.@xcite .",
    "indeed a variety of vortices , which include the continuous vortices ( the vortices with soft - core ) have been observed in the rotating superfluid @xmath0he - a.@xcite all of the continuous vortices are associated with @xmath5-texture are stable in the open systems where angular momentum of cooper pair , @xmath5-vector is not constrained .",
    "on the other hand , in the parallel plate geometry , where superfluid @xmath0he is confined between two parallel plates with a gap @xmath6 , where @xmath7 ( @xmath1 10 @xmath2 m ) is the dipole coherence length , the @xmath5-vector is forced to be perpendicular to the plate.@xcite in such a geometry , the continuous vortices can not exist , and one may conclude that the vortices with the circulation @xmath8 called the phase vortices or the singular vortices are only possible vortices.@xcite however , salomaa and volovik@xcite predicted that the half quantum vortices(hqvs ) with @xmath9 should exist in the parallel plate geometry . in spite of intensive experimental search , the hqv has not been found in the rotating superfluid @xmath0he - a in the confined geometry.@xcite    it is worthwhile to note that the hqvs have played an important role outside the superfluid @xmath0he - a .",
    "for example , the hqvs in the tricrystal geometry in the high temperature cuprate superconductors played the crucial role in identifying @xmath10-wave symmetry of the high temperature superconducting order parameter.@xcite the hqvs in triplet superconductors have been also suggested @xcite to interpret the extremely strong vortex pinning observed in triplet superconductors such as upt@xmath11 , u@xmath12th@xmath13be@xmath14 , and sr@xmath15ruo@xmath16.@xcite    the present work is motivated by the recent experiment by yamashita et al.@xcite we consider the superfluid @xmath0he - a confined between the two parallel plate with the gap @xmath6 , where the rotation axis and the magnetic field are perpendicular to the parallel plates . using the standard formula for free energies given in [ ] , we found the followings .",
    "( a ) the singular vortices with @xmath17 are unstable and split into pairs of hqv with @xmath18 , unless the rotation speed is very high , @xmath19 rad / s .",
    "( b ) for small rotation speed ( @xmath20 2 rad / s ) , the bound pairs of hqvs are more stable than the free hqvs .",
    "( c ) only the bound pairs of hqvs are detectable by nmr as satellite signals .",
    "both the singular vortices and free hqvs lead to nmr signals indistinguishable from backgrounds , since they do not disturb the configuration of @xmath21 .",
    "( d ) our results of the satellite frequencies and the intensities are consistent with the observation of satellite peak in the parallel plate geometry.@xcite in particular , while @xmath22 weakly depends on the temperature and the magnetic field strength , both the satellite frequency and the satellite intensity are almost independent of the field strength and temperature .",
    "the superconducting order parameter of superfluid @xmath0he - a is characterized by 2 unit vectors called l - vector , @xmath5 and d - vector , @xmath4 .",
    "we can write the gap function as@xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 here @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) are pauli matrices and @xmath27 , @xmath28 are spin @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) are the projection of the unit wave vector @xmath33 in the plane perpendicular to @xmath5 .",
    "therefore @xmath5 corresponds to the quantization axis of the angular momentum of the cooper pair .",
    "this is also called the chiral vector .",
    "when the spatial variation of @xmath4 and @xmath5 are much slower than @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , coherence length , the spatial configuration of @xmath5 and @xmath4 are described by the texture free energy.@xcite . in the following , we shall compare the texture free energy of a singular vortex(or phase vortex ) , and a free pair of hqv with an optimized distance @xmath36 , where @xmath36 is a distance between two hqvs .    the texture free energy is given by @xmath37 where we assumed the parallel plates extend in the @xmath38 plane . here",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 are spin susceptibility and spin wave velocity .",

    "we also assumed @xmath47 everywhere due to the parallel plate constraint.@xcite within the weak - coupling theory of bcs p - wave superconductor , we obtain @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "for the pressure of @xmath50 bar with the superfluid transition temperature @xmath51 mk corresponding to the experimental set - up by yamashita et al@xcite , we found @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",

    "@xmath59 corresponds roughly the distance between two vortices , if we divide the two - dimensional space in circular cells with radius @xmath27 .",

    "note that the free hqv is only stable for a relatively small @xmath87 for all @xmath41,width=259 ]    from these results , we analyze the @xmath54 dependence of the satellite intensity ( @xmath104 ) as follows .    in the small rotation speed ,",
    "the bound pairs are most stable .",
    "so in the equilibrium condition , the satellite intensity increases linearly with @xmath54 .",
    "when @xmath54 reaches @xmath22 , the free hqv pairs become more stable .",
    "many bound pairs are converted into free pairs .",

    "it is also interesting to note that the @xmath54 dependence of the satellite intensity @xmath104 looks surprisingly similar to @xmath105 versus @xmath106 in typical type ii superconductors as first formulated by abrikosov .",
    "as we mentioned above , both the singular vortices and free hqvs do not produce any characteristic nmr signals , since their presence does not disturb the configuration of @xmath21 . on the other hand , the bound pairs of hqvs are clearly visible by nmr as discussed in [ ] .",
    "we adopt the formulation for the nmr satellite frequencies and intensities studied in [ ] .",
    "however , in the present case there will be no potential energy for the longitudinal mode , since the rotation of @xmath4 around the z - axis does not change the dipole energy .",

    "note that there is a trivial solution of @xmath125 with @xmath126 , which does not give a distint satellite signal .",

    "therefore , the temperature dependence in the experiment suggests that the vortex pinning becomes weaker as temperature decreses .",
    "since salomaa - volovik s proposal for the hqvs in 1985 , hqvs have been searched in the rotating superfluid @xmath0he - a in the confined geometry . however , all of earlier experiments have been done in the wider gap @xmath151 ( @xmath152 ) .",

    "the above observations are in fact consistent with our hqv scenario .",
    "we have shown that @xmath154 is independent of @xmath155 and @xmath156 . also from the universality of this ratio ,",
    "we predict that the satellite frequency and the intensity are almost independent of @xmath155 and @xmath156 , when we ignore the vortex pinning effect .",
    "on the other hand , any texture involving @xmath5-texture should depend strongly on temperature and gap size @xmath151 .",
    "furthermore , another satellite frequencies associated with @xmath5-bend textures should appear near @xmath157.@xcite absence of these satellites clearly indicate that the satellites seen in yamashita et al @xcite should be due to the bound pairs of hqvs .",
    "the parallel experiments with different size of @xmath151 are highly desirable to distinguish the @xmath4-texture vs. @xmath5-textures as well , as our study indicates that the satellite frequency is independent of @xmath151 .",
