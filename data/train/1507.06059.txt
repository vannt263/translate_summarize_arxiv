    "type iin ( narrow line ) supernovae ( sne ) are characterized by narrow emission lines atop broad wings , slow evolution , and a blue continuum at early times @xcite .",
    "their high h@xmath1 and bolometric luminosities can be explained by the shock interaction of supernova ( sn ) ejecta with a dense circumstellar medium ( csm ; * ? ? ?",
    "the shock waves accompanying the circumstellar interaction heat gas to x - ray emitting temperatures and accelerate particles to relativistic energies , giving rise to radio synchrotron emission .",
    "indeed , type iin supernovae ( sne iin ) are among the most luminous radio and x - ray sne , e.g. , sn 1986j @xcite , sn 1988z @xcite , sn 1995n @xcite , and sn 2006jd @xcite .",
    "although high csm densities should enable radio and x - ray emission , few sne iin are detected in these bands . amongst the detected ones ,",
    "the x - ray and radio light curves of these sne cover a range of luminosities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite carried out a study of 10 sne iin with the very large array ( vla ) , but did not detect radio emission from any of them .",
    "type iin sn 1998s was not particularly luminous at radio and x - ray wavelengths @xcite , which can be attributed to a relatively low csm density . however , sn 2006gy was very luminous at optical wavelengths , implying a very high csm density , but was not luminous at x - ray wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the lack of x - ray emission here can be attributed to mechanisms that suppress the x - ray emission at high density , including photoelectric absorption , inverse compton losses of hot shocked electrons , and compton cooling in the slow wind @xcite .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of a sn may initially increase with csm density , but eventually turns over because of a variety of effects that suppress x - ray emission .    in this paper , we discuss x - ray and radio observations of sn 2010jl , which may be close to the case of a maximum x - ray luminosity .",
    "sn 2010jl was discovered with a magnitude of 13.5 in unfiltered ccd images with a 0.40-m reflector at portal , az , u.s.a . on 2010",
    "november 3 @xcite and brightened to mag 12.9 over the next day , showing that it was discovered at an early phase .",
    "sn 2010jl is at a position @xmath2 , @xmath3 ( j2000 ) @xcite , associated with a galaxy ugc 5189a at a distance of 49 mpc ( @xmath4 ) , implying that sn 2010jl belongs to the class of luminous sne iin with an absolute visual magnitude @xmath5 .",
    "pre - discovery observations indicate an explosion date in early 2010 october @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue for an explosion date around @xmath6 days before i - band maximum , i.e. around jd 2,455,4692,455,479 , or 2010 september  29october  9 .",
    "we assume 2010 october 1 to be the explosion date for sn 2010jl  throughout this paper .",
    "@xcite found that the host galaxy for sn 2010jl  is of low metallicity , supporting the emerging trend that luminous supernovae ( sne ) occur in low metallicity environments .",
    "they determined the metallicity @xmath7 of the sn region to be @xmath8 .",
    "we take this upper limit as the metallicity of the gas in the galaxy .    after the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) on - board _",
    "swift _ detected x - rays from sn 2010jl on 2010 november @xmath9 @xcite , we triggered our _ chandra _ target of opportunity ( too ) observing program in 2010 december and 2011 october .",
    "these observations were presented in @xcite , in which a very rapid evolution of the column density was reported .",
    "@xcite also reported a constant x - ray flux of the sn , consistent with optical wavelengths where it displayed a flat light curve early on @xcite .",
    "while the peak r - band luminosity of sn 2010jl is smaller than the super - luminous class of supernovae , such as sn 2006gy , sn 2006tf and sn 1997cy , sn 2010jl is the most luminous x - ray sn so far .",
    "@xcite reported simultaneous _",
    "nustar  _ and _ xmm - newton  _ observations and determined the temperature of the shock .",
    "because of the high temperature of the supernova emission , the hard x - ray sensitivity of",
    "_ nustar  _ was crucial to obtain a reliable temperature estimate .",
    "they estimated the shock velocity to be @xmath10 @xmath11 .",
    "given the estimate of the shock velocity and the total luminosity of the sn , it is possible to estimate the density profile of the csm if the forward shock wave is radiative . with this assumption",
    "the presupernova star lost @xmath12 in the decades prior to the explosion @xcite .",
    "the h lines in sn 2010jl  showed a narrow component with an expansion velocity @xmath13 @xmath11 coming from the csm ; along with broad wings which , at early times , are well fitted by an electron scattering profile produced by the thermal velocities of electrons @xcite . here",
    ", the line profiles do not reflect the bulk motions of the sn and the high velocity regions are presumably obscured by the circumstellar gas .",
    "however , over the first 200 days , the broad component shifts to the blue by @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have explained this shift to be due to the formation of dust in the dense shell resulting from circumstellar interaction or in the freely expanding ejecta .",
    "however , @xcite argue that dust formation is unlikely and attribute the line shift to radiative acceleration of circumstellar gas ; in this case , the broadening of the lines is due to electron scattering .",
    "although the situation with the h lines is ambiguous , there is clearer evidence for high velocity motion in the he  i  @xmath15 line .",
    "@xcite find a blueshifted shoulder in the @xmath15 line between 100 and 200 days that is likely due to the ejecta emission up to a velocity of @xmath16 , in rough agreement with the velocity deduced from the temperature of x - ray emitting gas at a later time .    in this paper",

    "@xcite argue that this is the time when the sn reached the momentum conserving snow - plow phase .",
    "however , as we will show in section  [ sec : model ] , this can be explained in our simple model by changes in the csm density profile .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sn3 ] , we also plot the x - ray and bolometric luminosities of another well sampled type iin , sn 2006jd @xcite .",
    "the luminosity decline is much flatter in sn  2006jd than that of sn 2010jl . around the same epoch , the sn 2006jd x - ray lightcurve declines as @xmath338 , while sn 2010jl declines as @xmath339 .",
    "the relative flatness of the bolometric luminosity of sn 2006jd for a longer duration indicates that the csm interaction powered the light curve for a much longer time than sn 2010jl  .",
    "this indicates that the duration of mass ejection in sn 2006jd may have been longer in this case than for sn 2010jl , though in both cases occurred shortly before the explosion .",
    "this suggests different nature of progenitors for the two sne .",
    "the most interesting result of the paper is the evolution of the column density with time . at @xmath340 days , the column density is 3000 times higher than the galactic column density , and declines by a factor of @xmath13 by the epoch of our last observation in 2014 dec .",
    "since the higher column density is not associated with the high host galaxy extinction , this indicates that the higher column density is due to the csm in front of the the shock where the dust is evaporated , thus is arising from the csm .",
    "the presence of broad emission lines seen in early sn 2010jl  optical spectra @xcite can be explained by electron scattering @xcite .",
    "this requires an electron scattering optical depth @xmath341 , i.e. a column density greater than @xmath342 @xmath85 .",

    "these constraints are difficult to reconcile with a spherical model of the column density @xmath346 @xmath85 .",
    "we therefore should admit that either the width of emission lines at the late time is not related to thomson scattering , or the x - rays escape the interaction region avoiding the csm with a high column density .",
    "thus , a possible scenario for the csm in sn 2010jl  is the same as the bipolar geometry in the csm of @xmath347carinae @xcite .",
    "an intriguing issue here is the presence of an extra component in the 2011 october and 2012 june _",
    "chandra  _ data , which is not present before or after .",
    "this component is well fit with a power law index of 1.7 , though with a varying column density , with much higher column density at the 2011 october epoch .",
    "the origin of this component is not clear .",
    "however , the component seems to spatially coincide with the the position of the sn and occurs when there are changes to the sn spectrum in the energy range close to that of the extra component .",
    "this would seem to suggest that the emission is related to the sn .",
    "one possibility is that the soft component is a result of a cooling shock . in this scenario a mass loss rate of @xmath348yr@xmath86 @xcite",
    ", wind velocity @xmath13 @xmath11 @xcite , and shock temperature of 19 kev ( this paper ) corresponds to a cooling time of 86 days at @xmath349 cm ( roughly the radius at one yr for ejecta velocity of 4000 @xmath11 ) .",
    "thus the forward shock should be cooling around this time , as mentioned in our discussion of the optical light curve .",
    "an adiabatic shock model underestimates the low energy x - ray flux .",
    "the fact that the need for an additional component disappears could be a result of the shock becoming adiabatic .",
    "while the radio observations of sn 2010jl  started as early as @xmath350 days post explosion , the first radio detection was around day 566 .",
    "unlike its x - ray counterpart , the radio luminosity from sn 2010jl  is weak for a sn iin ( fig .",
    "this is unlike sn 2006jd which was an order of magnitude brighter in radio bands than sn 2010jl @xcite .",
    "like most of the known radio type iin sne , sn 2010jl rises at radio wavelengths at late times , most likely due to absorption by a high density of csm , or due to internal absorption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have not attempted to fit a detailed model to the radio data in view of the small number of detections and small range of time . however , the existing data have distinctive features as seen in fig .   [ lc ] .",
    "the light curves are fairly flat , as are the frequency spectra . for the standard models of radio sne",
    ", these properties occur when the sn is making the transition from optically thick to optically thin ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , most likely we have detected the radio emission near the peak of the synchrotron emission .    from fig .",
    "[ lc ] , we estimate that the light curve peak at 5 ghz occurs on about day 900 at a flux of @xmath351 mjy , or a luminosity of @xmath352 ergs s@xmath86 hz@xmath86 .",
    "the time of maximum is typical of sne iin , but the luminosity is lower than most , suggesting that the absorption mechanism is not synchrotron self absorption if the radio emitting region is expanding at @xmath353 as indicated by x - ray ( this paper and * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and near ir observations @xcite .",
    "this can be seen in fig .  1 of @xcite .",
    "in the case of the type iin sn 1986j , the radio expansion was measured by vlbi techniques and an expansion velocity of @xmath354 was found over the period 1999 - 2008 @xcite .",
    "thus an expansion velocity of @xmath355 is plausible . in this case",
    ", the absorption would have to be something other than synchrotron self - absorption , most likely free - free absorption .",
    "the fact that the 8 ghz radio flux appears around day 700 implies the emission measure along the line of sight at this stage @xmath356 @xmath357 , where @xmath358 is the linear size of the absorbing gas region and assuming @xmath359 k. on day 700 the radius of the shell with an average velocity of 4000 km s@xmath86 is of @xmath360 cm . adopting @xmath361 we thus come to the rough estimate of the column density @xmath362 @xmath85 , where @xmath363 is the hydrogen ionization fraction .",
    "a low hydrogen ionization fraction of @xmath364 is needed for the value of @xmath93 to be consistent with the column density on day 700 recovered from the x - ray data ( @xmath365 @xmath85 ) .",
    "although we expect the csm to be ionized at early times , recombination is possible at later times ; however , a detailed study of the ionization balance in the csm of sn 2010jl is beyond the scope of this paper .    another possibility for explaining the escape of the radio emission is that it comes from a different region than the x - ray emitting region . to have a lower column ,",
    "the radio region would probably come from expansion into a lower density part of the csm and would thus be more extended .",
    "the x - ray emission from the radio region may not be detected because of the low density .",
    "again , details are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the detailed evolution of the absorbing column density derived from the x - ray data provides us with an unprecedented opportunity to examine the csm around a sn  iin in both x - ray and optical bands .",
    "the question arises of whether the optical light curve powered by the csm interaction is consistent with the observed column density . here",
    ", we present a simple circumstellar interaction model which suggests that freely expanding sn ejecta collide with the dense csm . in a smooth dense csm",
    "the interaction zone consists of a forward and a reverse shock along with a cool dense shell ( cds ) formed in - between .",
    "we confine ourselves to the interaction hydrodynamics based on the thin shell approximation @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion and mass conservation are integrated for arbitrary density distributions in both ejecta and csm using a 4th order runge - kutta scheme .",
    "the model provides us with the cds radius ( @xmath366 ) and velocity ( @xmath367 ) , the forward shock speed @xmath368 , the reverse shock speed @xmath369 , and the kinetic luminosity released in the shock @xmath370 , where @xmath371 is preshock density and @xmath372 is the shock velocity ( @xmath373 ) .",
    "generally , the conversion of the kinetic energy into the radiation in the interaction sne is affected by complicated hydrodynamic and thermal processes including the thin shell instability @xcite , the rayleigh - taylor instability of the decelerating cds , the csm clumpiness , mixing , and energy exchange between cold and hot components via radiation and thermal conductivity .",
    "this makes the computation of the radiation output of the cs interaction quite a formidable task .",
    "we use a simple approach in which the x - ray luminosity of both shocks is equal to the total kinetic luminosity times the radiation efficiency @xmath374 , where @xmath375 is the cooling time of the shocked csm at the age @xmath326 . to calculate the shock cooling time we assume a constant postshock density four times the upstream density @xmath376 , while the shock temperature is calculated in the strong shock limit .",
    "we find that the reverse shock is always fully radiative in our models . in the case of sn 2010jl",
    ", the optical luminosity dominates the observed x - ray luminosity by a factor of ten . in our model , the bolometric luminosity , which is primarily in the optical , is equal to the total radiation luminosity .",
    "the model assumes that the optical radiation generated in the interaction zone instantly escapes the csm which means that the diffusion time [ ] chev81 is smaller than the expansion time , or the csm optical depth @xmath377 ( where @xmath378 is the shell speed ) . in our model , on day 3 the column density of the wind is @xmath379 @xmath85 and the thomson optical depth at this stage is therefore 30 .",
    "this value is comparable to @xmath380 assuming @xmath381 @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , after about day 3 the diffusive trapping of photons in the wind can be ignored .",
    "the sn ejecta density distribution is approximated by the analytical expression @xmath382 $ ] which reflects an inner plateau ( @xmath383 ) and an outer power law density drop with @xmath384 .",
    "the initial ejecta boundary velocity @xmath385 is assumed to be @xmath386 km s@xmath86 ; our results are not sensitive to the boundary velocity in the range of @xmath387 km s@xmath86 at epochs @xmath388 d. the csm density distribution is set by a broken power law @xmath389 with @xmath390 in the range of @xmath391 and @xmath392 for @xmath393 .",
    "the value @xmath394 was chosen for small radii because it is an approximate fit and is plausible for a wind ; the outer value of @xmath395 is a fitting parameter .",
    "the ejecta diagnostics based on the csm interaction can not constrain the ejecta mass and energy uniquely because the same density versus velocity distribution in the ejecta outer layers can be produced by a different combination of mass and energy . yet",
    "the observed interaction luminosity and the final velocity of the decelerated shell ( @xmath396 ) constrain the energy of the outer ejecta with the velocity @xmath397 . for the adopted density power law index @xmath328 the obvious relations @xmath398 , @xmath399 , and @xmath400 result in the energy - mass scaling @xmath401 , or @xmath402 , assuming @xmath403 . in turn , this scaling , when combined with the requirement that the velocity @xmath396 should be larger than the ejecta density turnover velocity @xmath404 , provides us with the lowest plausible values of @xmath405 and @xmath406 . as a standard model we adopt an ejecta mass of @xmath407 which barely satisfies the condition @xmath408 .",
    "the corresponding kinetic energy of ejecta is then @xmath409 erg .",

    "the agreement between the optical model csm column density and that inferred from x - ray data suggests that the csm density recovered in the model is realistic .",
    "the external radius of the csm envelope , @xmath337 cm , combined with the wind velocity of 100 km s@xmath86 implies that the sn event was preceded by an episode of vigorous mass loss starting 40 yr prior to the explosion .",
    "the mass loss rate at this stage was @xmath426 yr@xmath86 , which is similar to the value obtained in @xcite .",
    "although the overall picture of the x - ray generation by csm interaction with absorption in the csm is generally convincing , there is an issue with the x - ray luminosity .",
    "the point is that the unabsorbed x - ray luminosity is significantly ( a factor of 10 ) lower then the optical .",
    "but at late times , @xmath427 d , the forward shock dominates the luminosity so one would expect that more than half of the total x - ray radiation escapes the interaction zone , at odds with the observations .",
    "the disparity suggests there is some mechanism that converts the kinetic luminosity into the optical radiation avoiding significant hard x - ray ( @xmath428 kev ) emission .",
    "the soft xuv radiation then could be absorbed by the csm resulting in the x - ray deficit . given the thomson optical depth @xmath429 , @xmath430 , and @xmath431 , neither compton scattering in the csm nor compton cooling of hot electrons in the forward shock are able to provide the required degree of x - ray softening @xcite .",
    "an alternative scenario is conceivable which connects the x - ray deficit to csm clumpiness .",
    "although radiative properties of the shocked csm can not be reliably quantified , the predominance of soft radiation is a likely outcome in this case . indeed ,",
    "if the bulk of the csm were in clumps the luminosity of the shocked intercloud gas would be weak . the cool matter mixed with hot gas in this scenario",
    "becomes a dominant source of the radiation that falls into the soft xuv band .",
    "thermal conductivity might allow heat flow from the hot shocked intercloud gas into the mixed cool gas .",
    "alternatively , @xcite have explained this deficit to be due to the presence of an anisotropic csm , because of which most of the x - rays are absorbed and converted into optical photons .",
    "we note that in the case of sn 2006jd , the bolometric luminosity is around an order of magnitude larger than the x - ray luminosity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sn3 ] ) .      in our x - ray",
    "spectral fits of ugc 5189a and other nearby sources , we allow the column density to vary freely and also use a metallicity of 0.3 @xcite for the excess column density ( over galactic ) .",
    "we derive a host column density of @xmath432 @xmath85 , whereas , @xcite have fit all the nearby x - ray sources with a fixed galactic column density ( @xmath96 @xmath85 ) and a power law spectrum with photon index @xmath433 .",
    "part of the discrepancy can be accounted for the fact they have used solar metallicity as opposed to 0.3 solar metallicity for the host galaxy used by us .",
    "this will lower their equivalent hydrogen column density in the xspec fits by a factor of three .",
    "@xcite , using a fit to the lyman-@xmath1 damping wings , find @xmath434 @xmath85 for the host galaxy , while the corresponding value is @xmath435 @xmath85 from the milky way .",
    "their galactic column density is around a factor of 2 lower than the one derived from @xcite .",
    "however , the gmrt has observed the sn 2010jl  host galaxy ugc 5189 in 21 cm radio bands @xcite in 2013  november - december , and they derive the hi column density to be @xmath104 @xmath85 , consistent with our best fit values .",
    "we caution here that the column densities obtained in our fits have large uncertainties , and our estimates for the host galaxy may be treated as an upper limit on the host column density .",
    "although our best fit temperature agrees with that found by @xcite , our column density is somewhat smaller ( @xmath436 @xmath85 ) than that quoted by @xcite which is @xmath437 @xmath85 ; the difference is more significant considering they have used solar metallicity . to test the robustness of our best fit column density we have attempted to fit only the _ xmm - newton  _ spectrum as _ xmm - newton  _ data are especially sensitive to the column density due to absorption being dominant in the 0.210  kev energy range .",
    "we obtain a column density of @xmath438 @xmath85 ( @xmath111 ) , which is consistent with our joint fit .",
    "the contour plot of the column density for _ xmm - newton  _ data shows that it is well constrained ( figure [ fig : nustar ] ) .",
    "@xcite dispute the values of high column density at early times obtained by @xcite by claiming that they have used many parameters .",
    "however , in addition to the fits to x - ray data , the additional evidence of a high column density comes from the fe  k-@xmath1 line seen in 2010 december 78 _ chandra  _ data and 2010 november _ swift - xrt  _ data , which suggests @xmath439 @xmath85 ( assuming @xmath440 and @xmath441 kev ) , consistent with the absorption column density obtained in our fits .",
    "@xcite fit the early _",
    "chandra  _ data with blackbody models , considering the medium to be optically thick to x - rays .",
    "however , a blackbody fit corresponds to an extremely small emitting area .",
    "for example , at an early epoch , for an x - ray luminosity of @xmath442 erg s@xmath86 and a temperature of 3.4  kev , the blackbody emitting radius is only @xmath443 cm , which is physically not plausible , considering the expected large area of the shock front .",
    "thus we disfavor the blackbody model . @xcite",
    "also fit their models using a powerlaw . in our models",
    ", we have tried to fit the data using powerlaw models .",
    "while a powerlaw does give acceptable fits , the photon index is very flat ( @xmath444 ) , which is physically implausible .",
    "the steepening in the x - ray and bolometric luminosity light curve around day 300 is quite significant . @xcite",
    "explain the steepening by arguing that the shock reached the fast cooling snow - plow phase .",
    "however , in our model we can explain this by introducing a steepening in the density profile .",
    "our mass loss estimates are a factor of 10 smaller than @xcite , but are consistent with @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy can be partly accounted by the fact that @xcite have assumed a wind velocity of 300 @xmath11 , whereas we assumed it to be 100 @xmath11 , adopted from @xcite .",
    "here we have reported the most complete x - ray and radio observations of a luminous type iin supernova sn 2010jl .",
    "sn 2010jl is the only type iin sn which has been well sampled in both radio and x - ray bands since early on .",
    "using publically available _",
    "nustar  _ data , we determine a temperature for the shocked gas that is consistent with the value obtained from @xcite .",
    "the 6.4 kev fe - k@xmath1 line seen in the first _",
    "chandra  _",
    "epoch @xcite is also present in the _ swift - xrt  _ data taken around the same time , confirming that this line is real .    while the radio emission is weak in sn 2010jl",
    ", the x - ray luminosity is one of the highest for a type iin sn .",
    "this provides us a unique opportunity to trace the evolution of the circumstellar column density .",
    "the circumstellar column densities at various epochs are 101000 times higher than that of the host galaxy .",
    "this evolution is satisfactorily reproduced in a model in which freely expanding sn ejecta collide with the dense and smooth csm , with the forward shock luminosity being a fraction of the kinetic luminosity depending upon the radiation efficiency .",
    "the x - ray light curve evolution is quite flat for the first 200 days .",
    "however , after @xmath445 days , the light curve shows a steep decline . there is a similar steepening of the optical luminosity , from which we infer a steepening of the csm density power law index from the standard @xmath446 profile .",
    "in contrast , the type iin sn 2006jd light curve at a similar epoch is much flatter , indicating differences in the mass loss leading up to the sn .",
    "the case of sn 2010jl is consistent with rapid mass loss beginning a short time before explosion .",
    "the observed radio emission for sn 2010jl  is very weak and does not clearly evolve as in standard models .",
    "the radio spectra and their evolution suggest that the emission is close to its peak at an age of @xmath447 days .",
    "the implication is synchrotron self - absorption was probably not a factor in the rise to maximum and that another process , likely free - free absorption , dominated .",
