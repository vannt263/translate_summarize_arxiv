    "b[e ] stars are stars of spectral type b with plenty of emission lines from permitted and especially forbidden transitions in predominantely neutral or low - ionized metals like oi and feii . in addition , these stars show strong infrared excess emission due to warm and hot circumstellar dust . since these spectral characteristics are related purely to the circumstellar medium of these objects , it is obvious that they might be found in stars in quite different evolutionary phases .",
    "and indeed , a detailed investigation of the b[e ] stars performed by @xcite revealed that b[e ] stars can be pre - main sequence as well as post - main sequence in nature ( see table[mk_classes ] ) .",

    "the number of confirmed binaries is , however , rather small .",
    "a step forward to prove this hypothesis might therefore be a detailed search for ( especially interacting ) binary components in these objects .",
    "the search for binarity in the unclassified b[e ] stars is not straightforward .",
    "the objects are usually faint , suffering from mostly unknown but large amounts of predominantely circumstellar extinction .",
    "in addition , their distances are far from being constrained , hampering proper luminosity determinations .",
    "some promising tools for finding binary components came up during the past years , and their applicability to b[e ] stars and reliability is discussed in the following .",
    "spectral disentangling is a powerful tool for the analysis of composite spectra of eclipsing binary or multiple stars .",
    "however , the requirement for proper disentangling is that high - quality spectra are available and cover as much as possible of the orbital period ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in extremely rare cases",
    "composite spectra of b[e ] stars have been obtained as in the case of mwc623 ( @xcite @xcite ; polster et al .",
    ", this volume ) , which might be a binary with a rather large period ( @xmath1years ) . however , in general the method of spectral disentangling is not advisable for finding binary components in b[e ] stars , because these stars are embedded in irregularly shaped and highly dynamical circumstellar material , contributing and polluting significantly the photospheric lines .",
    "in addition , several b[e ] stars have been found to have dynamical atmospheres as well , resulting in irregular line variations , since lines of different elements are formed at different atmospheric depths , delivering a variety of radial velocities ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . if such kind of lines are further contaminated by emission from dynamical and complex circumstellar material , the method of spectral disentangling",
    "can thus most probably be considered as delivering results , which might be rather unsatisfactory or even incorrect .      a more sophisticated technique in finding especially close binaries uses spectro - astrometry @xcite .",
    "this method has been successfully applied to herbig ae / be stars , since it is particularly suited for emission line stars ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the great advantage of spectro - astrometry lies in its ability to detect binary companions that are fainter by up to 6 mag",
    "however , the method is limited to separations larger than 100mas .",
    "the sample of @xcite contained three unclassified b[e ] stars : hd45677 , hd50138 , and hd87643 .",
    "the first two were claimed to be new binary discoveries , while the last one showed a highly complex spectro - astrometry , which , however , was not in agreement with a binary component .",
    "hd87643 was thus discarded by @xcite as a binary system .",
    "another tool to discover even closer binaries with separations @xmath2mas is provided by optical long baseline interferometry .",
    "for instance , observing classical be stars , @xcite discovered a companion to @xmath3 cen at a separation of 68.7mas .",
    "long baseline interferometry , nowadays limited to bright stars , additionally allows to resolve small scale structures , constraining the geometry of the circumstellar or circumbinary material ( see , e.g. , @xcite @xcite ; bonneau , this volume ) .",
    "in addition , @xcite recently applied a new technique of image reconstruction for the vlti / amber observations of the b[e ] star hd87643 , based on which they resolved a cool companion at a separation of 34mas .",
    "this method thus seems to be the most powerful one to disentangle companions at angular separation typically larger than 1mas , i.e. 1 - 2au at 1 - 2kpc , with typical periods larger than a few months .",
    "such systems are difficult to detect by classical spectroscopy .",
    "table[mk_classes ] highlights that all classified b[e ] stars possess a high - density dusty disk .",
    "this feature is especially puzzling for compact pne and luminous supergiants .",
    "in addition , detailed investigations on the compact pne hen2 - 90 revealed a latitude dependent ionization structure of its wind @xcite , while no evidence for binarity was found @xcite .",
    "such wind structures are generally observed from rapidly rotating stars .",
    "also , several magellanic cloud b[e ] supergiants were found to be rapidly rotating ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since rapid rotation is not expected for stars in these evolutionary phases , the stars must have been spun up . the most natural cause for a star to spin up",
    "is provided by binary merger processes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "such a scenario seems to be quite plausible , given that about 10% of all stars are expected to experience a merger process , as suggested by population synthesis models . for compact pne and supergiants the b[e ] phenomenon might therefore be strictly linked to binary merger processes , though a proof of this hypothesis , e.g. , in terms of abundance studies , has not been made yet .",
    "the b[e ] phenomenon in the yet unclassified stars has been proposed to be due to binary interaction .",
    "however , to test this hypothesis is a challenging task , since the methods of binary identification quickly reach their limit of applicability for stars being surrounded by highly complex and highly dynamical material .",
    "therefore , it is quite sobering , how little results have been achieved so far . using spectro - astrometry two binary systems",
    "were detected .",
    "the distribution of circumstellar material of a third b[e ] star studied was too complex and the separation of its binary component too small to be catched by spectro - astrometry .",
    "instead , this system was resolved by interferometry and image reconstruction techniques .",
    "the discovery of close binaries amongst the unclassified b[e ] stars is the first but most important step towards our understanding of their nature .",
    "the search for indications that interaction is or has been taking place is the next step to test the interacting binary hypothesis . this task is challenging , especially with respect to the large number of unclassified b[e ] stars , but with the advent of the described new techniques our odds are improving .",
