    "wormholes are handles or tunnels in spacetime that connect different regions of our universe but may also connect completely different universes . as first proposed by morris and thorne @xcite , wormholes could be actual physical structures suitable for interstellar travel .",
    "for the wormhole spacetime they proposed the following static spherically symmetric line element : @xmath0 using units in which @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath2 is called the _ redshift function _ , which must be everywhere finite to avoid an event horizon .",
    "the function @xmath3 is called the _",
    "shape function _ since it determines the spatial shape of the wormhole when viewed , for example , in an embedding diagram . the spherical surface @xmath4 is the radius of the _ throat _ of the wormhole and must satisfy the following conditions : @xmath5 , @xmath6 for @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , usually called the _ flare - out condition_. this condition can only be satisfied by violating the null energy condition , discussed later .",
    "the einstein field equations in the orthonormal frame @xmath9 yield the following simple interpretation for the components of the stress - energy tensor : @xmath10 , the energy density , @xmath11 , the radial pressure , and @xmath12 , the lateral pressure .",
    "for the theoretical construction of the wormhole , morris and thorne proposed the following strategy : retain complete control over the geometry by specifying the functions @xmath3 and @xmath2 to obtain the desired properties and then manufacture or search the universe for the materials or fields that yield the required stress - energy tensor .",
    "researchers have tried various alternate strategies to accomplish this goal , two of which are discussed in this paper .",
    "the first , the assumption of a noncommutative - geometry background , is discussed in sec . [",
    "s : non ] .",
    "the second , the assumption that the static and spherically symmetric spacetime admits a one - parameter group of conformal motions , is discussed in sec . [",
    "s : killing ] . taken together ,",
    "these assumptions produce both the shape and redshift functions and thus a complete wormhole solution .",
    "some of these ideas have already been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , albeit with slightly different assumptions and techniques .",
    "what these approaches have in common is a redshift function resulting in a wormhole that is not asymptotically flat .",
    "the wormhole material would therefore have to be cut off and joined to an external schwarzschild vacuum solution .",
    "what makes the redshift function unusual is that the cut - off can be chosen in such a way that the junction surface is a boundary surface , that is , a surface having zero surface stresses .",
    "the main goal in this paper is to show that the wormhole obtained is thereby stable to linearized radial perturbations .",
    "a particularly useful outcome of string theory is the recognition that coordinates may become noncommutative operators on a @xmath13-brane @xcite .",
    "the commutator is @xmath14 = i\\theta^{\\mu\\nu}$ ] , where @xmath15 is an antisymmetric matrix .",
    "the implication is that noncommutativity replaces point - like structures by smeared objects .",
    "( the aim is to eliminate the divergences that normally occur in general relativity . )",
    "the smearing effect can be accomplished by using the gaussian distribution of minimal length @xmath16 instead of the dirac delta function @xcite .",
    "this is also the approach used in ref .",
    "an equally effective way is to assume that the energy density of the static and spherically symmetric and particle - like gravitational source has the form @xcite @xmath17 here the mass @xmath18 is diffused throughout the region of linear dimension @xmath16 due to the uncertainty .",
    "the noncommutative geometry is an intrinsic property of spacetime and does not depend on particular features such as curvature .",
    "the einstein field equations @xmath19 result in the following forms @xcite : @xmath20 @xmath21,\\ ] ] and @xmath22.\\ ] ] since eq .",
    "( [ e : ein3 ] ) can be obtained from the conservation of the stress - energy tensor , @xmath23 , only two of eqs .",
    "( [ e : ein1])-([e : ein3 ] ) are independent . as a result ,",
    "these can be written in the following form : @xmath24 and @xmath25 eq . ( [ e : rho1 ] ) immediately yields the total mass - energy @xmath18 of the wormhole inside a sphere of radius @xmath26 : @xmath27 next , from eq .",
    "( [ e : ein1 ] ) , @xmath28 ^ 2 }     + r_0,\\ ] ] so that @xmath5 , as required . since eq .",
    "( [ e : shape1 ] ) is valid for any @xmath29 , the wormhole can be macroscopic .",
    "the resulting shape function is @xmath30 moreover , from @xmath31 we find that ( since @xmath32 ) @xmath33 so that the flare - out condition is met .    _",
    "remark : _ for later use , we observe that @xmath34 has continuous derivatives of all orders .",
    "closely related to the flare - out condition is the violation of the null energy condition .",
    "observe that @xmath35\\right|    _ { r = r_0}\\\\    = \\frac{m\\sqrt{\\theta } }    { \\pi^2(r_0 ^ 2+\\theta)^2}-\\frac{1}{8\\pi }    \\frac{b(r_0)}{r_0 ^ 3}<0\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] since @xmath32 .",
    "the violation of the null energy condition can be attributed to the noncommutative - geometry background without hypothesizing the need for  exotic matter . \"",
    "we assume in this paper that our static spherically symmetric spacetime admits a one - parameter group of conformal motions .",
    "these are motions along which the metric tensor of a spacetime remains invariant up to a scale factor .",
    "this assumption is equivalent to the existence of conformal killing vectors such that @xmath36 where the left - hand side is the lie derivative of the metric tensor and @xmath37 is the conformal factor .",
    "( for further discussion , see @xcite . )",
    "the vector @xmath38 generates the conformal symmetry and the metric tensor @xmath39 is conformally mapped into itself along @xmath38 .",
    "according to @xcite , this type of symmetry has been used effectively to describe relativistic stellar - type objects , not only yielding new solutions , but leading to new geometric and kinematical insights @xcite .    as already noted , exact solutions of traversable wormholes admitting conformal motions",
    "are discussed on ref .",
    "two earlier studies assumed _ non - static _ conformal symmetry @xcite .    to study the effect of conformal symmetry , it is convenient to use an alternate form of the metric @xcite : @xmath40 the einstein field equations then take on the following form :    @xmath41    @xmath42    and    @xmath43 = 8\\pi p_t.\\ ] ]    next , following herrera and ponce de len @xcite , we restrict the vector field by requiring that @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the four - velocity of the perfect fluid distribution .",
    "the assumption of spherical symmetry then implies that @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "( [ e : lie ] ) now yields the following results : @xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath49    we can then use these equations to obtain @xmath50 and @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are integration constants .",
    "the einstein field equations can also be rewritten : @xmath54 @xmath55 and @xmath56 as before , only two of eqs .",
    "( [ e : e1 ] ) -([e : e3 ] ) are independent .",
    "it is interesting to note that the shape function , eq . ( [ e : shape2 ] ) , can also be obtained by substituting eq .",
    "( [ e : rho1 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ e : e1 ] ) instead of eq .",
    "( [ e : ein1 ] ) , as before .",
    "so the assumption of conformal symmetry is clearly not needed for determining @xmath34 , but it does determine the redshift function from eq .",
    "( [ e : gtt ] ) , thereby completing the wormhole solution . using the notation in sec .",
    "[ s : introduction ] , we therefore have @xmath57 it now becomes apparent that our wormhole spacetime is not asymptotically flat .",
    "in fact , the redshift function obtained above does not even appear to have a particularly desirable form .",
    "it turns out , however , that the form actually has some unexpected and potentially useful properties , as we will see in the next section .",
    "since by eq . ( [ e : gtt ] ) the wormhole spacetime is not asymptotically flat , the wormhole material must be cut off at some @xmath58 and joined to an exterior schwarzschild solution , @xmath59 here @xmath60 , so that @xmath61 , whence @xmath62 where @xmath18 is determined from in eq .",
    "( [ e : mass ] ) .    while the metric is now continuous at the junction surface , the derivatives are not .",

    "now eq . ( [ e : p1 ] ) becomes @xmath70 since @xmath6 and @xmath71 is monotone decreasing , we can choose @xmath53 in such a way that @xmath72 , and since @xmath73 , we get @xmath74 by eq .",
    "( [ e : p2 ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the cut - off can be chosen in such a way that the surface stresses are zero .",
    "such a surface is called a _ boundary surface _ and should result in a stable structure . that is the topic of the next section .",
    "given the junction surface @xmath58 , denoted by @xmath75 , our starting point is the darmois - israel formalism @xcite : if @xmath76 is the extrinsic curvature across @xmath75 ( also known as the second fundamental form ) , then the stress - energy tensor @xmath77 is given by the lanczos equations : @xmath78     -\\delta^i_{\\phantom{i}j}[k]\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath79=\\lim_{r\\to a+}x-\\lim_{r\\to a-}x = x^{+}-x^{-}.$ ] so @xmath80=k^+_{ij}-k^-_{ij},$ ] which expresses the discontinuity in the second fundamental form , and @xmath81 $ ] is the trace of @xmath82 $ ] .    in terms of the energy - density @xmath66 and the surface pressure @xmath83 ,",

    "( [ e : sigma ] ) in the form @xmath94 will yield the following equation of motion : @xmath95 here @xmath96 is the potential , which can be put into the following convenient form : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the mass of the junction surface , normally referred to as a _ thin shell _ @xcite .",
    "this applies only to cases in which @xmath66 is different from zero .",
    "when linearized around a static solution at @xmath99 , the solution is stable if , and only if , @xmath96 has a local minimum value of zero at @xmath99 , that is , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , and its graph is concave up : @xmath102 . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , for @xmath96 in eq .",
    "( [ e : potential1 ] ) , these conditions are met .",
    "since we are now dealing with a dynamic analysis , we will take @xmath99 to be the cut - off discussed earlier . returning to eqs .",
    "( [ e : sigma1 ] ) and ( [ e : p1 ] ) , @xmath103 and @xmath104 . next , consider the  boundary layer \" extending from @xmath105 to @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "so for @xmath108 in the interval @xmath109 , @xmath110 is no longer equal to zero .",
    "being arbitrarily thin , the boundary layer can be viewed as a thin shell separating the interior and exterior solutions . since",
    "the thin shell is not part of the interior solution , we have , as a result , @xmath111 and @xmath112    we are seeking a solution that ( 1 ) meets the stability criterion and ( 2 ) is arbitrarily close to our solution .",
    "this nearby solution should be viewed as a mathematical solution , rather than a physical one .",
    "to construct such a solution , we modify @xmath3 on the interval @xmath109 smoothly , that is , we modify @xmath34 in such a way that the second derivative remains continuous ( referring to the earlier remark ) .",
    "the modification is shown in fig .",
    "1 : the concave down     for @xmath108 in the interval @xmath109.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    curve @xmath34 is bent down slightly to produce @xmath113 for some @xmath108 in the interval @xmath109 , where @xmath114 denotes the modified shape function . observe that @xmath114 is also concave down , but it has a larger curvature , that is , @xmath115 .",
    "regarding the notation , modifying @xmath34 will also modify @xmath116 on the interval @xmath109 , denoted by @xmath117 .",
    "since our goal is to show that @xmath102 and since @xmath118 and @xmath119 , we will retain the original notations @xmath34 and @xmath116 to simplify the discussion .",
    "it is important to note that since @xmath107 can be arbitrarily small , @xmath108 is arbitrarily close to @xmath120 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath66 is nonzero , @xmath121 is also nonzero and , above all , approximately constant .",

    "to that end , we first find the conditions for which @xmath126 first observe that @xmath127 , @xmath128 , while @xmath129 is negligible .",
    "this leads to @xmath130 or , after multiplying both sides by @xmath131 and rearranging , @xmath132 to satisfy this inequality , the left side must be negative .",
    "this implies that we must have @xmath133 , so that @xmath134 .",
