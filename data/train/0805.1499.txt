    "water cerenkov detectors ( wcds ) have played a significant role in advancing the field of particle physics .",
    "the combination of large mass coupled with low cost led to their use in the detection of cosmic ray@xcite , solar@xcite , and accelerator neutrinos@xcite and resulted in some of the most definitive evidence for neutrino oscillations .",
    "in addition , wcds have been used to set limits on proton decay@xcite and to detect neutrinos from supernovae@xcite .",
    "the principle of operation of current detectors is rather simple .",
    "water has a refractive index ( n ) of roughly 1.33 and so charged particles moving at a speed greater than c / n ( where @xmath2 is the speed of light in a vacuum ) will emit cerenkov photons at an angle @xmath3 ( 1/n ) to their direction of travel .",
    "these photons have a characteristic @xmath4 spectrum , which means that much of the detectable light is emitted in the ultraviolet .",
    "pure water happens to have a ` transparency window ' with attenuation lengths greater than 50 m in the spectral region from about 320 to 480 nm .",
    "this is well - matched to the cerenkov spectrum and the sensitivity of bi - alkali photomultiplier tubes .",
    "figure 1 shows the attenuation coefficient ( @xmath5 ) plotted against wavelength for purified water contained in the 50k ton super - kamiokande neutrino detector@xcite .    unfortunately , water from typical public potable water supplies",
    "has a much shorter attenuation length in the uv , often 5 - 10 meters or less .",
    "the reason for this is not well - understood .",
    "nevertheless , standard water purification systems that remove dissolved solids have empirically been found to solve this problem .",
    "thus all operating water cerenkov neutrino detectors have an associated water treatment plant .",
    "this component is a significant percentage of the construction expense .",
    "in addition , it is found that the water in the detector will deteriorate in transparency - even under a nitrogen atmosphere and in a stainless steel or high - density polyethylene ( hdpe ) tank . thus the water treatment plant must be run continuously to maintain detector water quality and stability .",
    "this is often the largest operational expense of wcds .",
    "recently super - kamiokande has published limits on a search for ` relic supernovae'@xcite .",
    "while nearby supernovae are rare , the expected rate integrated over the entire universe is substantial and is predicted to produce a diffuse supernova neutrino background [ dsnb ] .",
    "this flux , if observable , could provide information about stellar collapse and nucleo - synthesis , and the rate of stellar formation as a function of red shift .",
    "these limits are still a factor of 4 - 5 away from the most optimistic models of stellar formation . in this case , most of the expected interactions come from @xmath6 interactions with hydrogen in the water due to the so - called ` inverse beta decay ' reaction :    @xmath7    there are significant backgrounds for this reaction from atmospheric neutrino interactions in the same range . many of these are from muon neutrino interactions that produce a muon below the cerenkov threshold which subsequently decays to produce a michel electron or positron in the middle of the sn neutrino energy range . in reactor neutrino experiments using this same interaction , the capture of the daughter neutron and subsequent gamma emission",
    "are used as an effective tag to discriminate against background .",
    "unfortunately , the 2.2 mev gamma from capture on hydrogen in the water results in relatively little cerenkov emission .",
    "thus there is interest in dissolving in the water nuclei with large capture cross section and higher energy gamma emission .",
    "use of cdso@xmath8 in water has been previously discussed @xcite .",
    "beacom and vagins@xcite have also suggested the use of gdcl@xmath9 in order to boost the capture gamma energy via an 8 mev gamma cascade .",
    "they pointed out that the addition of only small amounts of gdcl@xmath9 ( 0.2@xmath0 by weight ) would result in about 90@xmath0 of the neutrons being captured on gd .",
    "this would reject a substantial part of the atmospheric neutrino background and greatly improve the sensitivity of super - kamiokande for dsnb events .",
    "this would also be advantageous to separate ` cooling ' from ` neutronization ' neutrinos should we be fortunate enough to detect a supernova in our own galaxy .",
    "thus there is substantial motivation to use chemical additives in both super - kamiokande and in possible future megaton scale detectors .",
    "in addition to neutrino detection , wcds are now being considered as active water shields for some next - generation dark matter ( dm ) / weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) detectors .",
    "such particles could comprise all or part of the dm in the universe .",
    "experimental searches for wimps have been going on for 20 years with ever increasing sensitivity .",
    "recently , liquid nobel gas detectors have shown great promise for further extending the search one or two more orders of magnitude . in these detectors",
    ", wimps would show up as low energy nuclear recoil events in a heavy liquid target such as xenon or argon .",
    "nuclear recoil events produced by the interaction of non - thermal neutrons in the target are a significant background for these experiments .",
    "a transfer via elastic scatter , followed by neutron escape from the detector , can mimic a wimp recoil .",
    "while tagging of a large fraction of muon - induced events is possible with a simple muon veto system , direct rejection of un - vetoed or non - muon initiated nuclear recoils is more difficult .",
    "pulse shape discrimination ( psd ) is of no help here , since single neutron - induced recoils are essentially identical in light and charge deposition and timing to wimp - induced ones .",
    "a dangerous source of background are radioactive u / th contaminants in the materials of the detector itself , with a major worry being ( @xmath5,n ) reactions on boron and silicon in the pmts .    one way to reduce internal neutron backgrounds is to efficiently tag those neutrons that leave the central detector sensitive volume .",
    "estimates from the lux collaboration show that this could potentially reduce such backgrounds by an order of magnitude .",
    "thus there is great interest in gadolinium doping of water for dm searches .",
    "there are three potential problems associated with gadolinium doping of water :    1 .",
    "the additive might reduce the transparency of water in the uv , seriously reducing detector sensitivity .",
    "2 .   the additive might induce corrosion that would affect the mechanical strength of the detector components .",
    "corrosion product ions might absorb light in the uv , reducing detector sensitivity .",
    "thus before any of these experiments can be done it is crucial to understand the effect of the gadolinium dopant on the detector itself to avoid the ` law of unintended consequences . '",
    "one of the least expensive and most readily available gadolinium compounds is gadolinium chloride ( gdcl@xmath1 ) .",
    "it is highly soluble and known to be relatively benign environmentally and from a health safety point of view . in this paper , we report the first results from a three year study on the effect of gdcl@xmath9 on detector materials and water transparency relevant to existing and future water cerenkov detectors .",
    "figure 2 is a schematic of the llnl water cerenkov transmission facility ( wctf ) .",
    "it consists of a water purification system ( water resin demineralizers , conductivity sensor , 0.22@xmath10 m and 5@xmath10 m filters , polypropylene transfer piping , a mixing tank , and 1.27 cm diameter 304l grade stainless steel transfer piping which is used to fill the light transmission arm ( lta ) .",
    "the lta is a 9.6 m , 20.3 cm diameter 304l stainless steel pipe which can be filled with pure or doped water . during the process of mixing the gdcl@xmath9 ,",
    "nitrogen gas is bubbled through the mixing tank to reduce the dissolved oxygen content in the system .",
    "the water purification system is capable of providing high purity water ( resistivity @xmath11 17.5m@xmath12 cm ) to the stainless steel lta at a flow rate of 5.7@xmath1311.4 lpm .",
    "this resistivity value corresponds to total dissolved solids of @xmath14 40 ppb .",
    "the mixing tank , lta and transfer piping contain a total of about 570 liters and the turn@xmath13over time ( at a typical flow rate of 9.5 lpm ) is approximately one hour .",
    "the effects of exposure to gdcl@xmath9 on materials used in super - kamiokande was previously reported in @xcite .",
    "additional testing was conducted by placing two 50.8 cm super - kamiokande pmts in a 2470 liter stainless steel storage tank filled with gdcl@xmath9 .",
    "the results of these tests will be reported at a later date .",
    "the system is capable of testing the attenuation length of water at three wavelengths .",
    "the output of an l.s.i .",
    "vsl-337nd - s pulsed nitrogen laser can produce a 337 nm beam directly .",
    "in addition , the n@xmath15 laser output can pump organic dyes .",
    "the two dyes used were stilbene-420 which produces a 420 nm pulse and ppbo which produces a 400 nm pulse .",
    "figure 3 shows the detector optics arrangement used for the conduct of the transparency testing .",
    "the optics are arranged on optical tables and enclosed in two light - tight boxes at both ends of the lta .",
    "the lta is closed at both ends by 0.8 cm thick ultra@xmath13violet light transmitting ( uvt ) acrylic windows . except for a 3 cm @xmath16 20 cm slit ,",
    "the two acrylic windows at each end of the lta are covered by black plastic to prevent unwanted external light from entering .",
    "the lta contains four identically sized baffles spaced at intervals in the interior to remove scattered light .",
    "the l.s.i .",
    "laser generates a 337 nm 4ns pulse at approximately 2 hz .",
    "the laser beam is collimated by two apertures of 6.3 mm and 3.0 mm diameter . the beam is then split by a uv non - polarizing cube beam - splitter .",
    "one part of the beam - designated the primary ( p ) beam - is sent directly into a coated integrating sphere and then through a uv transmitting liquid lightguide ( lumatec series-250 ) to a white rectangular integrator which houses a mu - metal shielded pmt ( hamamatsu h3378 - 50 ) . the other beam - designated the reflected",
    "( r ) beam - is transmitted directly through the uvt acrylic window into the lta .",
    "the r beam exits the far end of the lta into a light - tight enclosure which houses a 5.08 cm diameter uv mirror ( newport optics bbds - pm-2037-c @xmath11 99@xmath0 reflectivity ) .",
    "this mirror is aligned to reflect the r beam back through the lta and into the laser enclosure .",
    "after re - entering the laser enclosure , the r beam is transmitted through a 10@xmath0 transmitting neutral density filter ( nd ) into a spherical integrator ( for 337 nm ) or an acrylic ` light - box ' containing a solution of ludox ( hs-40 12 nm diameter colloidal silica ) and pure water ( for 400 nm and 420 nm ) .",
    "the r beam is then transmitted through a separate lumatec lightguide into the rectangular enclosure housing the pmt .",
    "use of the same pmt to measure both the reflected and primary pulses allows us to cancel pmt gain variations .",
    "the change in the attenuation length of the gdcl@xmath9-water solution can be determined by measuring the change in the ratio of the r laser pulse to the p laser pulse over time .",
    "let @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the intensity of the pulse at the distance @xmath19 through the lta , @xmath20 is the initial intensity and @xmath5 is the attenuation coefficient in m@xmath21 . assuming that p , r are proportional to i@xmath22 and i respectively , then :    @xmath23    where @xmath18 is the intensity of the reflected pulse and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are constants of proportionality .",
    "we define the ratio :    @xmath26    letting @xmath27 be the ratio in pure water and @xmath28 be the ratio after adding gdcl@xmath9 , then : @xmath29 where the unknown constants @xmath24 and @xmath25 cancel . the uncertainty in @xmath30 is then given by : @xmath31 typical values for pure water @xmath5 at uv wavelengths are 0.01 m@xmath21 @xmath13 0.02 m@xmath21 .",
    "the p and r beams were observed as two pulses well separated by about 90ns on a tektronix dpo 4034 digital oscilloscope .",
    "figure 4 shows a typical trace for a double pulse at 337 nm . to determine the intensities",
    ", we integrate over the area of the single p and r pulses and then calculate the ratio @xmath32 r / p. to obtain @xmath33 , we find the mean and variance of one - hundred separate pulses taken over a duration of about three minutes .",
    "this set of 100 pulses will be referred to as a ` measurement ' .    in order to understand the response of the detector to changes in transparency caused by the addition of gdcl@xmath1",
    ", we conducted a series of ` control ' experiments by adding only pure water to the lta and performing measurements identical to those to be performed with the gdcl@xmath1 water solution .    before each measurement",
    ", the reflected beam was aligned to the same point at the entrance of the r beam light integrator and re - checked for alignment after completing each measurement .",
    "typically it took about 10 minutes to take all readings between alignment checks .",
    "if the beam moved more than about 2 cm from the initial point of alignment , the measurement was discounted and a new measurement was taken after the apparatus had come to equilibrium .    to prove the stability of our detector , another control experiment conducted was to circulate pure water through the water purification system and the lta , secure the recirculation and then take measurements of @xmath33 over a two week period while it remained sitting in the lta ( i.e. no circulation ) .",
    "these measurements are shown as a function of time in figure 5 and indicate a 12.5@xmath0 decrease in @xmath33 over the period of more than two weeks . while the cause of the loss of transparency is unclear , it is of interest to note that the @xmath34 1.0@xmath0 per day fall off in transparency is less than that typically observed in sk with the recirculation turned off , even though the stainless steel surface to volume ratio of our apparatus is almost 200 times larger .",
    "for the 337 nm and 420 nm measurements , the amplitudes of both p and r were approximately equal for the pure water measurements .",
    "this condition ensured that the response of the detector to both the p and r pulses is the same .",
    "however , this condition was not met for the case of the 400 nm measurements due to the poor efficiency of the pbbo dye . because of this fact , an independent alignment of the optical system at 400 nm was not possible . as a consequence ,",
    "the alignment uncertainty is greater for 400 nm than the other two wavelengths as discussed in the section on uncertainties .",
    "our measurements are affected by four significant sources of uncertainty .",
    "the first of these is associated with the variation in the pulse - to - pulse measurement of @xmath33 over short time intervals due to thermal turbulence in water and the the vibrational motion of optical components . to quantify this uncertainty , we take the average of the measured 100 pulse variation at each wavelength for each measurement of @xmath33 in pure water .",
    "the values determined are : for 337 nm : @xmath35 ; for 400 nm : @xmath36 ; and for 420 nm : @xmath37 .    a second uncertainty was associated with reproducibility of the the r beam alignment .",
    "this uncertainty was quantified by conducting alignments of 10 randomly ` misaligned ' beams in rapid succession and obtaining the variations in the measurements of @xmath33 .",
    "based on these measurements , the following estimates for the uncertainty were obtained : for 337 nm : @xmath38 ; and for both 400 nm and 420 nm : @xmath37 .",
    "another uncertainty is associated with the linearity of the system response to changes in light transparency . in this report",
    "no measurement of @xmath33 below 45@xmath0 were made so only the detector response above this value is addressed . to determine the detector linearity uncertainty , uv transmitting nd filters",
    "were inserted between the beam - splitter and the lta and the measured @xmath33 compared to the expected light transmission .",
    "the transmission of each of the nd filters was measured using a calibrated monochromometer to better than 0.5@xmath0 .",
    "figure 6 shows the normalized @xmath33 value plotted against the filter transmittance . in this case , ` normalized ' means that the @xmath33 value with no filter present is taken to be 1 . the uncertainty in the light transmission linearity is conservatively taken to be the difference in the slope of a fitted line from 1 .",
    "the corresponding uncertainties are : @xmath39 for 337 nm ; @xmath40 for 400 nm and @xmath41 for 420 nm .",
    "lastly , there was an uncertainty associated with the long@xmath13term stability of our detector .",
    "this uncertainty was quantified by determining the value of @xmath33 after the gdcl@xmath9 had been removed from the lta and pure water re - added .",
    "we were able recover the original pure water baseline to within @xmath421.0@xmath0 , @xmath422.5@xmath0 and @xmath422.0@xmath0 for 337 nm , 400 nm and 420 nm wavelengths , respectively .",
    "these values are taken as conservative estimates of the long - term drift .",
    "table 1 lists the estimated uncertainties for our measurements at each wavelength .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ , > \" , ]     as seen in the table , the change in @xmath33 due to the addition of only 14ppb of fecl@xmath9 to pure water results in a reduction in @xmath33 to about of 40@xmath0 of the pure water value while the addition of 28ppb of fecl@xmath9 to water drops @xmath33 to 16@xmath43 of the pure water value .",
    "it is clear that the presence of extremely small amounts of fecl@xmath9 significantly reduce water transparency .",
    "we have shown that gdcl@xmath9 is problematic for use as a dopant for detectors lined with stainless steel ( e.g. super - kamiokande ) due to it s effects on water transparency . at concentrations of 0.2@xmath0 by weight",
    ", the transparency of the gdcl@xmath9 doped water decreases rapidly over time scales of a few days for all three uv wavelengths tested .",
    "however , since the addition of gdcl@xmath9 by itself does not reduce transparency , it may be suitable for detectors made of non - corrosive materials .",
    "the significant benefits of using gadolinium doped wcds suggest that additional investigation is required to test the effect of gdcl@xmath9 on other materials . in this vein , we plan additional tests to examine the effect on transparency of materials such as polyethylene jacketed steel and acrylic .",
    "additionally , other chemicals such as gd@xmath44(so@xmath8)@xmath9 and gd(no@xmath9)@xmath9 should be tested for suitability as a gadolinium wcd dopant .",
