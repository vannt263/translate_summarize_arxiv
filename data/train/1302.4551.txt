    "the low temperature mechanical properties of structural glasses , such as bulk metallic glasses ( bmgs ) , are characterised by a large elastic strain and a well defined yield point  @xcite .",
    "this latter feature is particularly the case for tensile deformation , but work has also shown that if a pure uni - axial stress state can be achieved in compression , the yield point is also reproducible with a high weibull modulus comparable to that of a work - hardened crystalline metal  @xcite .",
    "thus , although bmgs lack good ductility , they are not brittle in the ceramic sense since the relatively low weibull modulus of a ceramic indicates a failure mechanism sensitive to macroscopic flaws . like work hardened crystalline metals , this suggests that the structure of a bmg is relatively homogeneous above a certain length scale , and yield is an intrinsic material property .",
    "other related properties characterising the low temperature deformation regime of bmgs are a strong spatially heterogeneous plasticity , a weak strain rate sensitivity of the yield stress and its approximately linear decrease with respect to increasing temperature .",
    "there has been much work attempting to characterise the underlying microscopic structural mechanisms mediating plastic evolution in bmgs . in the seminal work of spaepen",
    "@xcite , the picture of single atom migration into regions of excess free volume was proposed . in subsequent theoretical work by argon  @xcite , the atomic scale structural transformation was hypothesised to consist of a rearrangement of atoms which mainly resulted in a local shear stress relief . the early atomistic work of falk and langer  @xcite supported this picture introducing the concept and terminology of the shear transformation zone ( stz ) , in which groups of atoms collectively undergo a local shear transformation .",
    "static and ultra - high strain rate dynamic atomistic simulations have given much insight into the concept of the stz  how it may be realised at the atomic level and how together they might collectively behave for the emergence of material yield and subsequent plastic flow  @xcite .",
    "indeed , recent molecular dynamics simulation work by guan _",
    "@xcite suggests that at high enough strain rates macroscopic yield corresponds to a stress - induced reduction of the glass transition temperature , providing a link to the quite general phenomenon of jamming / unjamming  @xcite .    in both the works of spaepen",
    "@xcite and argon  @xcite , the theory of thermal activation played a central role , an approach that forms the basis of many numerical mesoscopic models of quasi - static plastic flow in bmgs @xcite . indeed for temperatures outside the low temperature deformation regime , and close to the glass transition , simple thermally activated viscoplastic models can describe well the experimentally observed strong temperature and strain rate dependent deformation behaviour  @xcite  a regime of deformation that is now spatially homogeneous and closely related to the viscosity of the under - cooled liquid regime .    in the under - cooled liquid regime ,",
    "two distinct relaxation timescales are believed to determine the physics of viscosity .",
    "these are the slow @xmath0-relaxation processes and the fast @xmath1-relaxation processes , both of which were first postulated by considering the underlying potential energy landscape ( pel )  @xcite , and latter confirmed by experiment  @xcite .",
    "the pel viewpoint has afforded great physical insight into the origin of the strong temperature dependence of viscosity in approaching the glass transition temperature from the under - cooled liquid regime  @xcite , as evidenced by the developed understanding of the well known angell plot that introduced the important material parameter of fragility  @xcite .",
    "the pel for an under - cooled liquid is seen as a complex energy landscape of hills and valleys consisting of mega - basins , whose exit characterises the @xmath0-relaxation , and whose underlying finer structure characterises the @xmath1-relaxation  @xcite .",
    "it is in this context that @xmath1-relaxation is said to mediate @xmath0-relaxation , a viewpoint that is also extended to temperatures below , but close to , the glass transition . in this high temperature regime ( of a bmg ) , @xmath1-relaxation is seen as being equivalent to stz activity causing a build up of internal stress that ultimately underlies the @xmath0-relaxation energy landscape  @xcite .",
    "indeed , for a wide range of bmgs , there exists a strong correlation between the apparent barrier energy corresponding to @xmath0-relaxation ( derived from the experimental kinetic fragility ) and the characteristic barrier energy associated with thermally activated plastic flow ( derived from temperature dependent strain rate deformation behaviour )  @xcite .    as mentioned in the introductory paragraph , at temperatures well below the glass transition ,",
    "distinctly different deformation behaviour is observed .",
    "because of the experimentally observed weak temperature and strain rate dependence of the yield ( and maximum flow ) stress , there has been some focus on athermal explanations  @xcite in which an effective temperature is introduced arising from the inherent quenched structural disorder of the amorphous solid",
    ". however , there are experimental indications that a thermal activation mechanism also underlies the strongly inhomogeneous plasticity characteristic of this low temperature regime .",
    "this is particularly the case for compression geometries in which the initiation and propagation of shear bands and serrated versus non - serrated flow has been studied  @xcite .",
    "thermal activation theories have also been used to describe the weak reduction in yield stress with increasing temperature .",
    "using elasticity theory , argon  @xcite obtained a stress dependent critical barrier energy whose leading order term resulted in the reduction of yield stress following a @xmath2 power - law  @xcite .",
    "more recently , johnson and samwer  @xcite have used a thermal activation model to derive an expression for the characteristic stress of plastic flow , which they argued is representative of the characteristic yield stress , to obtain a @xmath3 temperature dependence that describes well the universal trend seen in bmgs between yield stress ( divided by a representative elastic modulus ) and temperature .",
    "again , the concept of a critical stz barrier energy was used .    in this paper , the properties of the under - cooled liquid pel",
    "are further exploited to develop a theory of thermally activated plasticity for bmgs which is valid at both high and low temperatures below the glass transition .",
    "the current work extends on previous work  @xcite and gives more detail to that presented in ref .",
    "specifically , the complexity of the underlying pel , in terms of the number of underlying available irreversible structural transformations and their energy distribution , is extended to temperatures below the glass transition and used to postulate a coarse grained distribution of @xmath0-relaxation barrier energies . when used in conjunction with the thermal activation hypothesis , a plastic transition rate is obtained that characterises a temperature and stress scale",
    "at which non - negligible plasticity occurs giving a measure of the yield stress and a definition to the critical barrier energy alluded to by argon  @xcite and johnson and samwer  @xcite .",
    "two distinct temperature regimes emerge , a high temperature regime close to the glass transition temperature in which the yield stress rises rapidly and non - linearly from zero with decreasing temperature , and a low temperature regime in which the plastic transition stress increases approximately linearly with decreasing temperature .",
    "it is found that this latter deformation regime is strongly affected by the universal phenomena of freezing and extreme value statistics of the pel , leading naturally to an origin for the experimentally observed universal temperature dependent deformation behaviour of amorphous solids at low temperature .",
    "to study the deformation properties of a structural glass , the characteristic time scale , @xmath4 , associated with plastic activity at a particular length - scale is considered . for temperatures close to and above the glass transition temperature ,",
    "the viscosity is proportional to such a time scale  @xcite . at temperatures below the glass transition temperature , where the initial plasticity is characterised by a transition from elasticity to a plastic flow regime , the inverse @xmath5^{-1}$ ]",
    "can be viewed as a plastic rate .",
    "such a basic description of low temperature plasticity can not include elastic / plastic accommodation issues and any corresponding structural evolution , and is therefore unable to give quantitative insight into the nature of subsequent macroscopic plastic flow such as shear banding under compression and brittle fracture under tension .",
    "however , as a quantitative measure of the stress at which significant plasticity begins to occur , such a description will suffice and indeed has been used in the past to describe the transient yield strength prior to macro - plasticity  @xcite and the yield rate by johnson and samwer  @xcite .",
    "if there exists a certain length scale above which a glass maybe considered homogeneous , then all material volume elements of a size comparable to this length scale are equivalent .",
    "it is the calculation of @xmath6^{-1}$ ] for such a representative volume element ( rve ) that is of current interest .",
    "a rve has well defined properties because a sufficient level of self averaging occurs with respect to a shorter length - scale which characterises the underlying heterogeneity .",
    "let the volume of such a heterogeneity length - scale contain a characteristic number of atoms , @xmath7 .",

    "the assumption of a lack of an explicit interaction between heterogeneous volumes is clearly an approximation to make the problem analytically simple .",
    "the universal phenomenon of freezing has however been found to be robust against certain forms of interactions  @xcite , and it is expected that for the low temperature regime where kinetic freezing plays a defining role in determining the nature of plasticity , the current results will not be fundamentally changed by the inclusion of interactions between the heterogeneous volumes .",
    "it remains a topic of future work to , in the first instance , characterise the interaction between heterogeneous volume elements and then to implement numerical procedures that are able to investigate their role not only in the transition from elasticity to plasticity but also in the flow regime of macro - plasticity .",
    "the arrhenius form used for @xmath173 , eqn .",
    "[ eqnyieldrate3 ] , to describe the average properties of the atomic scale @xmath1-relaxation / stz processes mediating the @xmath0-relaxation landscape exploration is the simplest choice that embodies the thermal activation hypothesis .",

    "[ secaer ] shows however that any such temperature dependence will only renormalize the parameters of the current model to a leading order of @xmath174 .",
    "thus the present model should be insensitive to the precise form of @xmath173 whether it be a function of temperature and/or applied stress .",
    "the current work has only considered an applied stress that is a simple shear . in comparing to experiment ,",
    "it was found that the a representative shear stress modulus sets the proportionality constant between the applied shear stress and the broadening of @xmath26 , eqn .",
    "[ eqncond4 ] .",
    "deformation experiments are however usually performed under uni - axial loading conditions , were a compressive / dilatory component is also present .",
    "a more complex applied stress that contains such an isotropic component , such as the uni - axial loading experiment is expected to affect @xmath26 in a more complex manner by depending not only on a pure shear modulus but also on the poisson ratio .",
    "this aspect , and thus the role of local volume changes , will be investigated in future work .",
    "in the 2000 review article of angell _ et al _ @xcite , which articulated the contemporary questions to be addressed in the field of structural glasses , one such question for the low temperature regime was `` what types of processes remain active in the glass when the @xmath0 relaxation has been completely frozen ? '' .",
    "the present work demonstrates how such a freezing of the @xmath0 relaxation potential energy landscape could occur as the temperature reduces .",
    "indeed as the temperature decreases an increasing portion of this landscape becomes thermally inaccessible and therefore frozen  a process that is only complete at a temperature of absolute zero .",
    "thus the statistics of the @xmath0 relaxation processes , so integral to the under - cooled liquid regime , are also found to play a central role in determining those thermally active processes that lead to low temperature plasticity .    in summary",
    ", a model has been developed to describe the temperature dependence of the transition from elasticity to plasticity , the micro - plastic regime , in a bulk metallic glass .",
    "central to this model , is the assumption of thermally activated plasticity , and in particular , that plasticity occurs via the thermal activation of @xmath0-relaxation processes that are themselves mediated by multiple thermally activated @xmath1-relaxation / stz activity .",
    "further , it is assumed that the known exponentially number of stationary points in a glassy potential energy landscape for the under - cooled liquid regime , results in a distribution of @xmath0-relaxation barrier energies that has first and second cumulants which are extensive with respect to the underlying heterogeneous volume - scale of the glass .",
    "two distinct temperature regimes emerge . at high temperature , the shear stress at which significant",
    "plasticity occurs rises rapidly from its zero value close to the glass transition temperature , corresponding to a drop in the apparent barrier energy and apparent number of available structural transitions . in the case of the latter ,",
    "this reduction is comparable to the many orders of magnitude seen in the increase in the viscosity as the glass transition temperature is approached from the under - cooled liquid regime . at a low enough temperature ,",
    "the apparent number of structural transformations saturates , due to the eventual onset of kinetic freezing , and the low temperature regime is entered where the plastic transition stress now increases approximately linearly with respect to decreasing temperature . in this deformation mode ,",
    "the transition from elasticity to plasticity is sharp with respect to the applied stress , and for applied stresses characteristic of the elastic regime plastic activity is kinetically frozen indicating a single dominant barrier energy resulting in an underlying robustness of the elastic regime .",

    "<S> at temperatures well below their glass transition , the deformation properties of bulk metallic glasses are characterised by a sharp transition from elasticity to plasticity , a reproducible yield stress , and an approximately linear decrease of this stress with increasing temperature . in the present work it shown that when the well known properties of the under - cooled liquid regime , in terms of the underlying potential energy landscape , are assumed to be also valid at low temperature , a simple thermal activation model is able to reproduce the observed onset of macro - scopic yield . at these temperatures , the thermal accessibility of the complex potential energy landscape </S>",
    "<S> is drastically reduced , and the statistics of extreme value and the phenomenon of kinetic freezing become important , affecting the spatial heterogeneity of the irreversible structural transitions mediating the elastic - to - plastic transition . as the temperature increases and approaches the glass transition temperature , the theory is able to smoothly transit to the high temperature deformation regime where plasticity is known to be well described by thermally activated viscoplastic models . </S>"
