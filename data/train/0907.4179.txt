    "it is by now widely acknowledged that experiments performed on atoms and molecules afford the best chance of measuring , or else limiting the possible size of , the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of the electron @xcite .",
    "a lone valence electron inside an atom with large nuclear charge @xmath1 will feel an effective electric field enhanced beyond the field that is applied .",
    "for example , in atomic cesium the apparent field is 132@xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the applied electric field@xcite .",
    "this enhancement arises from the field s ability to mix the opposite - parity @xmath4 and @xmath5 states of cs , and a fairly large applied electric field is still required .",
    "more recent estimates using _ ab initio _ methods give enhancement factors for rb and cs of 25.74 and 120.53 respectively@xcite .",
    "experiments on the rb@xcite and cs@xcite atoms are currently being pursued to take advantage of the enhancement factor and long hold times achievable in the alkali atom family .",
    "thus , to achieve effective electric fields of about 12  gv / cm one would have to apply fields of @xmath61040  mv / cm to these atoms .",
    "this is not desirable in practice .",
    "however , one can hold ultracold rb and cs atoms in traps for a time long compared to the typical molecular beam experiment . therefore , one applies a smaller electric field while taking advantage of the long coherence times .",
    "it is the trade - off between hold time and effective electric field size that makes atomic electron edm experiments attractive and worth pursuing .",
    "herein lies the rub : one wants a very large applied electric field , but with great electric fields come great systematic problems .",
    "it would therefore be beneficial if the @xmath7-@xmath8 mixing could be achieved without the application of large laboratory electric fields .",
    "this is where molecules become interesting , since they can be quite adept at mixing @xmath7- and @xmath8-atomic orbitals on their own , without the need for large , applied electric fields .",
    "the field requirements to polarize the molecule may then be fairly modest .",
    "this important insight was initially due to sandars @xcite .",
    "typically , experiments aimed at measuring the electron edm in molecules have considered the simplest case of molecules with @xmath9 symmetry .",
    "then there is only one unpaired electronic spin and it has zero orbital angular momentum about the internuclear axis .",
    "one appealing way to achieve fairly robust molecules for this purpose is to pair an atom in an @xmath10 configuration ( such as yb or hg ) with fluorine .",
    "fluorine tends to capture an electron from any atom it encounters .",
    "thus , when one of the s - electrons is captured by f , a @xmath9 molecule is formed , as in ybf@xcite .",
    "moreover , the largely ionic bond is responsible for a large effective internal electric field that efficiently mixes the atomic @xmath7- and @xmath8-orbitals of the heavy atom @xcite .    in this article",
    "we suggest another class of @xmath11 molecules for edm searches . our emphasis is to consider molecules composed of atoms that can be laser cooled , thus greatly reducing the molecular temperature well below that available in molecular beam experiments .",
    "specifically , we consider the neutral molecules ybrb and ybcs , along with the molecular ions ybsr@xmath0 and ybba@xmath0 . in all cases , laser cooling of the neutral atoms has been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "indeed , recently short - lived ultracold samples of metastable ybrb@xmath12 have been produced via photoassociation @xcite .",
    "this idea is very similar to the proposed van der waals molecule csxe@xcite .",
    "these molecules , all of @xmath11 symmetry in their ground states , will have both advantages and disadvantages with respect to other molecules that are considered in edm searches .",
    "the chief disadvantage is that their electronic wave function suggests a sharing , or co - valency , of the bond and this somewhat limits the size of the effective electric field that they can sustain .",
    "we find that these fields are typically far smaller ( @xmath13@xmath14 times ) than the leading contender  tho , with an @xmath15  gv / cm@xcite .",
    "their main advantage is that they are cold enough to be trapped in either optical dipole traps or ion traps , leading conceivably to large coherence times within which to perform the experiment .",
    "in addition , these molecules , consisting of two heavy atoms , will have smaller rotational constants than the fluorides , hence can be polarized in somewhat smaller fields .",
    "this is a feature that can help reduce systematic effects .",
    "spin - rotational effects will also be reduced since they scale inversely with the reduced mass of the system ; the electron remains fairly well decoupled from the molecular axis in the lower - lying rotational levels of the molecules .",
    "another novel  though not necessarily beneficial  feature is that both atoms contain large-@xmath1 nuclei and thus can each contribute to the effective field .    in this article",
    "we therefore estimate the basic properties of these molecules , especially the effective electric fields they harbor .",
    "ii will discuss the ybrb and ybcs molecules and give the details of the potential energy surfaces and molecular parameters of the ground and excited states of interest .",
    "iii will present the same information for the ybsr@xmath0 and ybba@xmath0 molecular ions , as well as the neutrals from which they are derived .",
    "iv will detail the effective electric field calculations on the @xmath9 states of interest .",
    "v will present some concluding comments .",
    "alkali atoms such as rb and cs are the workhorses of laser cooling .",
    "@xcite . it is the unpaired @xmath7-electron that is of interest in an electron edm search since it is what we hope to coax into an @xmath7-@xmath8 hybridized atomic state . in the introduction we discussed the role of fluorine , which can extract an electron from a closed @xmath7-shell atom such as ba or yb .",
    "we can accomplish the same feat by pairing an alkali atom such as rb with a closed @xmath7-shell atom such as yb because yb is more electronegative than any alkali save h. this is similar to the pairing of cs with xe , as in @xcite , except xe is a closed @xmath8-shell atom .",
    "xe serves as a polarizing agent on the cs atom , causing the cs @xmath7- and @xmath8-orbitals to hybridize .",
    "moreover , the difference in electro - negativity is greater between cs and yb than between rb and yb , so that the ybcs molecule might be expected to be the more polar of the two .",
    "however , it is also important to consider the bonding length . a larger bond length would work to counteract the charge transfer mechanism because the two atoms would not get close enough together to allow the atomic wave functions to overlap . in order to understand the true details we turn to _ ab initio _ methods in order to gain understanding into the nature of the bonding process .    for the ybrb and ybcs systems we use the molpro suite of codes @xcite .",
    "we start at an inter - atomic distance @xmath16 and move in to @xmath17 . at @xmath18=25@xmath19",
    "we perform a self consistent field hartree - fock ( scf - hf ) calculation on the closed shell yb - alkali molecular ion system to obtain a starting wave function .",
    "we then perform a second scf - hf on the neutral ybrb molecule followed by a multi - configuration self consistent field calculation ( mcscf ) @xcite .",
    "the mcscf contains the ground @xmath20 as well as the excited @xmath21 and @xmath22 states arising from the alkali @xmath23 configurations .",
    "this is the starting configuration for the multi reference configuration interaction ( mrci ) @xcite calculation performed in each molecular symmetry group .",
    "we use an active space of \\{6,3,3,0 } with no closed orbitals .",
    "we used the stuttgart basis sets and effective core potentials ( ecp ) with core polarization potentials ( cpp ) for the alkali and yb .",
    "we used the ecp68mdf potential @xcite for yb , ecp36sdf potential for rb @xcite and ecp54sdf potential for cs@xcite .",
    "all of the basis sets associated with the ecps were left uncontracted .",
    "the active spaces in the calculations were chosen such that the experimental excitation energy of the alkali was reproduced to within 50@xmath24 .",
    "the results of the potential calculations are presented in figs .",
    "[ figs1ab ] a and b , for the ground state and the two lowest - lying dipole - allowed excited states in hund s coupling case ( a ) .",
    "the inset is an enlargement of the ground state showing that , while far shallower than alkali dimer potentials , it is expected to hold bound states . table  [ tab1 ] gives the relevant molecular parameters such as bond length , vibrational constant , dissociation energy , and rotation constant .",
    "the parameters were obtained by fitting the _ ab initio _ points to a morse potential .",
    "both ybcs and ybrb exhibit a large bonding length greater than 10@xmath25 in the ground @xmath20 state . due to the very shallow potential and large bond length",
    ", these molecules appear to be of a van der waals - type bonding nature , similar to that found in csxe@xcite .",
    "[ figs1ab ]    in each figure the solid arrow denotes the photoassociation step needed to drive the initial atom pair into an excited state molecule . for ybrb",
    ", this step has already been demonstrated experimentally @xcite .",
    "also shown schematically as a dashed arrow is the transition necessary to create molecules in the ground electronic , vibrational and rotational state .",
    "depending on which levels can ultimately be accessed in the first photoassociation step , this second transition may not be possible in a single step .",
    "the quest to produce ultracold , ground state polar molecules from ultracold atoms is currently a major research area , which has recently seen the production of molecular ground states@xcite .",
    ".[tab1 ] molecular parameters for ybrb and ybcs .",
    "bond distance @xmath26 , dissociation energy ( @xmath27 ) , vibration constants ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) , rotation constants ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) , and vibration - rotation mixing constants @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath26 is in atomic units while all others are in @xmath24 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table  [ tab5 ] we have separated out the contributions from both atoms individually .",
    "it is apparent that both atoms contribute to the size of the effective electric field , but with the opposite sign .",
    "we interpret this as both atoms polarizing in different directions with respect to the molecular axis . indeed , this is what is observed when one looks at the electronic distribution of the unpaired electron .",
    "we also note that @xmath33 of the ybrb and ybcs systems makes them an attractive alternative to experiments on the solitary alkali atoms .",
    "even though @xmath33 is small compared to other @xmath20 molecules , the expected long coherence times in an ultracold sample still makes them appealing . for the lone electron in rb ( cs ) atomic electron edm experiments one would have to apply an electric field @xmath3 of 27  mv / cm ( 4.5 mv / cm )",
    " using the enhancement factors in @xcite  to achieve the same @xmath33 .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the proposed alkali - yb molecular electron edm experiment where one needs @xmath341025  kv / cm .",
    "the values of @xmath3 in the molecular cases are based on multiplying @xmath35 by 35 in order to be in the linear stark regime .",
    "@xmath35 is defined as the electric field required to equalize the stark energy and the energy splitting between rotational levels in the molecule .",
    "@xmath35 is tabulated in table  [ tab5 ] .",
    "we have used the following convention for the overall sign of @xmath33 : we define the molecular axis @xmath36 as pointing from yb to a , where a is either an alkali or alkaline earth atom .",
    "this is because we choose the axis to point from more negative charge to more positive . in the alkali - yb molecules",
    ", yb has negative charge while in the alkaline earth - yb molecules it has less positive charge .",
    "a positive value of @xmath33 means that it lies against the direction of @xmath36 , i.e. points from positive charge toward negative charge .",
    "positive @xmath33 , in turn , means that the atomic electron is polarized so that it is displaced in the direction @xmath37 .",
    "these molecules offer alternatives to performing the experiments on rb and cs or sr@xmath38 and ba@xmath38 alone . in the atoms ,",
    "the size of @xmath33 is proportional to the applied field @xmath3 by an enhancement factor@xcite . in molecules ,",
    "this is not the case provided they are fully polarized .",
    "however , polarizing these molecules is not as easy to do as in the case of @xmath39 molecules discussed in @xcite . yet , the @xmath33 that can be attained is larger than the @xmath33 that can be attained in the atomic systems for a similar @xmath3 @xcite",
    ". therefore , with the recent advances in producing cold molecules , these systems offer very intriguing and viable alternative routes to probe for the electron edm .",
    "the idea of creating ultracold molecules from ultracold atoms , along with the anticipated benefit of molecules to electron edm searches , to explore a variety of laser cooled atoms paired with yb for an electron edm experiment is the focus of this paper .",
    "we chose heavier pairing partners in the hope of reducing the rotational constant of the molecules , thereby making them easier to polarize in modest applied electric fields .",
    "however , as one increases the mass of the pairing partner , one also increases the contribution it gives to @xmath33 and this contribution is always opposite to yb s contribution , thereby reducing the effect .",
    "therefore , there should be some trade off between reduced rotational constant and overall @xmath33 .",
    "future work would include exploring systems such as ybk , ybna , ybca@xmath0 , and ybmg@xmath0 .",
    "in addition , the same ideas would work for hg - paired partners .",
    "work on hgh@xcite has already been performed in regards to an electron edm experiment .",
    "systems such as hgli , hgna , etc",
    ". should also give similar results as the yb - paired systems with the added benefit that hg is heavier than yb , thereby hopefully producing a larger @xmath33 .",
    "we have considered a particular class of @xmath9 molecules that offer some advantages and drawbacks to current polar molecule electron edm searches .",
    "this type of molecule is formed from ultracold atoms so that the ground state molecules are also ultracold , leading to the possibility of longer coherence times .",
    "we have considered ybrb ( -0.7  gv / cm ) , ybcs ( + 0.54  gv / cm ) , ybsr@xmath0 ( -11.3  gv / cm ) and ybba@xmath0 ( + 1.2  gv / cm ) .",
    "ybrb and ybcs can be polarized in fairly modest fields and thereby are intriguing inasmuch as they offer some incentive over searching for the electron edm in the alkali atom alone .",
    "the molecular ions ybsr@xmath0 and ybba@xmath0 have many useful attributes , however , the field required to polarize these molecules is rather large for an ion trap .",
    "thus , the use of an optical lattice may be more practical for holding these ions for a long period of time without having to rotate an @xmath3 on the order of 1  kv / cm ."
