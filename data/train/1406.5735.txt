    "<S> background : : :    the information about the    @xmath0li@xmath1he reaction rates of    astrophysical interest can be obtained by extrapolating direct data to    lower energies , or by indirect methods . the indirect trojan horse    method , as well as various r - matrix and polynomial fits to direct    data , estimate the electron screening energies much larger than the    adiabatic limit . </S>",
    "<S> calculations that include the subthreshold resonance    estimate smaller screening energies . </S>",
    "<S> purpose : : :    obtain the @xmath0li@xmath2he    reaction r - matrix parameters and the bare astrophysical    @xmath3 factor for the energies relevant to the stellar    plasmas by fitting the r - matrix formulas for the subthreshold    resonances to the @xmath3-factor data above 60 kev . </S>",
    "<S> methods : : :    the bare @xmath3 factor is calculated using the single- and    the two - level r - matrix formulas for the closest to the threshold    @xmath4 and @xmath5 subthreshold states at    @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the    electron screening potential @xmath9 is then    obtained by fitting it as a single parameter to the low - energy data .    </S>",
    "<S> the calculations are also done by fitting @xmath9    simultaneously with other parameters . </S>",
    "<S> results : : :    the low - energy @xmath3 factor is dominated by the    @xmath5 subthreshold resonance at @xmath6 mev .    </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the other two subthreshold states is small . </S>",
    "<S> the    resultant electron screening is smaller than the adiabatic value . </S>",
    "<S> the    fits that neglect the electron screening above 60 kev produce a    significantly smaller electron screening potential . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations    show a large ambiguity associated with a choice of the initial channel    radius . </S>",
    "<S> conclusions : : :    the r - matrix fits do not show a significantly larger    @xmath10 than predicted by the atomic physics models . </S>",
    "<S> the    r - matrix best fit provides @xmath11 ev and    @xmath12 mev  b. </S>"
