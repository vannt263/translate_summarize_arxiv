    "dotted blue line is the same fit but with a larger @xmath129 . , width=377 ]    , of a @xmath63-graphene layer stack from a uhv grown si - face film as determined by x - ray reflectivity .",
    "the x - ray average is @xmath130 graphene layers while the aes estimate of the average is approximately one layer thicker ( 3.2 layers).,width=377 ]    [ f : si - face_histo ]    it is worth comparing the graphene thickness measured by sxrd and an estimate from the simpler aes method.@xcite the ratio of the si(lvv)/c(kll ) peak area can be used , along with proper electron mean free paths and excitation cross sections , to estimate of the number of graphene layers provided a suitable model for the interface is used .",
    "most groups use an interface model consisting of a bulk terminated substrate with graphene above.@xcite ( ref .",
    "considers a @xmath131 si adlayer ) .",
    "while bulk termination is clearly inconsistent with both models in fig .",
    "[ f : si - facemodel ] , it can still be used with the proviso that it will overestimate the film thickness by @xmath132 layer because the measured c(kll ) intensity includes a contribution from the dense non - graphitic interface carbon layer in fig .",
    "[ f : si - facemodel ] .",
    "aes measurements on the same sample as the data for fig .",
    "[ f : si - face_histo ] estimate the average graphene coverage to be 3.2 layers compared to 1.9 by x - rays , consistent with the lack of a realistic interface layer in the aes calculation .",
    "because the electron penetration depth of the si(lvv ) electron is short , aes estimates become more uncertain for graphene layers exceeding four layers .",
    "this makes the aes method more applicable to si - face films than to thick furnace grown c - face graphene films .",
    "we have used surface x - ray reflectivity measurements to determine the graphene / sic interface structure for graphene grown on the 4h - sic(0001 ) si terminated surface ( si - face ) .",
    "we find that the interface is not composed of a simple graphene - like layer above a relaxed sic bilayer that has been recently proposed.@xcite instead , the interface reconstruction is more complicated and extends deeper into the bulk .",
    "based on these x - ray experiments and previous xps studies  @xcite the best model for the interface is composed of a substantially relaxed sic bilayer , above which , a dense carbon layer containing a partial layer of si atoms separates it from the graphene film .",
    "the carbon density in this intermediate layer is approximately 2.1 times larger than in a sic bilayer .",
    "this model is consistent with previous stm  @xcite and xps  @xcite results as well as the lack of interface @xmath2 bands in arpes experiments .",
    "@xcite the bond distance between the si adatom layer and the first graphene layer ( si - up model ) is @xmath133 . while this distance is short compared to the interplanar graphene spacing , it is still larger than the corresponding distance measured on furnace grown sic@xmath1 c - face graphene ( @xmath134),@xcite indicating that the graphene on the si - face is less tightly bound to the substrate than furnace grown c - face graphene .",
    "this difference is consistent with _ ab - initio _",
    "calculations.@xcite we propose that the dense carbon layer with si adatoms plays the role of the buffer layer predicted by varchon et al.@xcite it is this layer that partly isolates subsequent graphene layers from interactions with the substrate .",
    "the x - ray results also indicate that the graphene is not flat but has a corrugation amplitude consistent with that measured by stm.@xcite this result confirms that the @xmath5  periodicity imaged by stm is dominated by a real structural corrugation of the graphene and not by changes in the local density of states .",
    "we wish to thank i. gadjev and k. charulatha for helping to prepare the reflectivity data and fits .",
