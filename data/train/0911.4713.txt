    "<S> the interpretation of the magnetic resonance and its relationship to superconductivity is complicated in the cuprates due to the occurrence of charge stripes and the pseudogap phase that lead to hotly debated models such as quantum excitations from charge stripes@xcite , or spin excitons from a particle - hole bound state of a @xmath7-wave superconductor@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a far clearer picture has emerged in the iron based superconductors partly due to their more itinerant nature . </S>",
    "<S> it was realized early on that the nesting between hole and electron fermi surfaces related by the antiferromagnetic wavevector * q*@xmath8 in the undoped iron superconductors , might also be responsible for unconventional superconductivity of the so - called extended @xmath5-wave symmetry@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> two excitations are clearly resolved in the transverse scans . at lower energies ( 2 - 6 mev ) </S>",
    "<S> , the two peaks merge to a broad response , far wider than the resolution function ( @xmath22q@xmath23  0.06 r.l.u . measured on the ( 200 ) bragg peak ) . </S>",
    "<S> these lower energy data at 20k are best modeled with two excitations as shown for example for the 6 mev data in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the dispersion of these excitations is linear up to 80 mev as shown in fig.[res2](a ) , and the points for the lower energy excitations fall on the same line confirming our above analysis . extrapolating the centers of these excitations to zero energy , red lines in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> this behavior in @xmath27  is reminiscent of fincher - burke excitations reported for many itinerant magnetic materials that are close to an antiferromagnetic instability@xcite and indicates that an itinerant , rather than a local moment picture is relevant for this superconductor .    </S>",
    "<S> [ scale= 0.35 ] maps    cooling below @xmath2  we find substantial changes to the lower energy magnetic excitations , while our measurements indicate that the higher energy excitations remain largely unchanged when compared to the normal state measurements , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ highe](b , d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the most pronounced changes are in the lower energy part of the magnetic excitation spectrum where the opening of a spin gap and the development of the magnetic resonance is observed as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ lowe](b ) . here </S>",
    "<S> a spin gap opens below @xmath28=4 mev , while there is an enhancement of the spectral weight above the spin gap that peaks at @xmath28@xmath29=6 mev . at higher energies the spectral weight returns to approximately the same values as the data found in the normal state , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ highe ] . </S>",
    "<S> constant energy scans at the commensurate position @xmath30=(1/2,1/2 ) between these dispersions also reflect these changes as shown in reference .    </S>",
    "<S> although the normal state magnetic excitations extend from incommensurate points it is important to establish if the magnetic resonance itself is centered on the commensurate wavevector @xmath30=(1/2,1/2 ) or if it consists of two excitations originating from the two incommensurate wavevectors ( at @xmath26 ) found in the normal state . for a more detailed analysis of the q - scans across the resonance </S>",
    "<S> we subtract the 20k from the 2k data in order to obtain only the magnetic scattering contributing to the resonance ( see below ) . </S>",
    "<S> these data are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ res2](b ) , while the centers of the resonant excitations are plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ lowe](b ) . between @xmath28=7 and 12 mev , the data shows well separated resonant excitations that follow the normal state dispersions , while their intensity decreases with energy transfer giving only a minor superconducting enhancement at 12 mev . at the resonance , </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath31 mev , a `` flat top '' excitation is evident that can be modeled with two incommensurate peaks at @xmath32 with @xmath4=0.05(1 ) , a value that departs slightly from the one found in the normal state .    </S>",
    "<S> the salient point of these measurements is that in the normal state the magnetic excitations show a behavior consistent with an itinerant antiferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> the onset of superconductivity affects only the lower energy magnetic excitations and spectral weight is shifted upwards to follow the normal - state incommensurate wave - vector dependence except at the spin resonance energy .    </S>",
    "<S> our ins results are qualitatively consistent with the extended s(@xmath33 ) model of the superconducting order parameter as we indeed observe the opening of a spin gap and the enhanced peak just above the gap as expected . </S>",
    "<S> however it is less clear if the magnetic resonance and its spectral weight in @xmath27  is consistent with this model . to clarify this </S>",
    "<S> we compute the magnetic susceptibility within the four - band model used previously to describe the fermi surface topology in iron - based superconductors@xcite and use the conventional random phase approximation ( rpa ) which describes the enhancement of the spin response of a metal in presence of the moderately strong ( interband and intraband ) repulsive interactions . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ lowe](c , d ) we show the results for the total _ physical _ rpa susceptibility , @xmath34i@xmath35 , calculated for the fermi surface topology that is consistent with arpes results on fe@xmath36te@xmath37se@xmath38 @xcite as a function of the momentum along the transverse direction ( 1/2+@xmath4,1/2-@xmath4 ) and @xmath28  in the normal ( c ) and superconducting ( d ) states ( details of these calculations are presented in the supplementary information ) . in order to simulate the experimental resolution we have convoluted the results by the experimental gaussian with @xmath39r.l.u . and @xmath40mev and the original calculated figures </S>",
    "<S> are shown in the appendix . due to the nesting condition ] of one of the hole - bands ( @xmath41 ) and the two electron - bands ( @xmath42 ) ( see fig .  [ disp ] in the appendix ) we find that in the normal state the spin response shows antiferromagnetic excitations centered on an incommensurate transverse wavevector with @xmath4=0.03 . </S>",
    "<S> these low - energy magnetic excitations in the metals , often called _ paramagnons _ , result from the proximity of the fermi surface to a magnetic instability and in our model we find that they disperse linearly from the incommensurate wavevectors . while the rpa theory indicates two peaks for each incommensurate wave vector ( counter propagating linearly dispersive modes ) , </S>",
    "<S> only a single peak is observed experimentally dispersing from each @xmath43 wave vector , suggesting stronger electronic damping than the current rpa treatment , as demonstrated previously by moriya et al.@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> [ scale= 0.32 ] resonance2    in the superconducting state , the magnetic susceptibility changes due to opening of the superconducting gap and the corresponding change of the quasiparticle excitations . here </S>",
    "<S> the imaginary part of the bare interband susceptibility ( i.e. without electron - electron interaction that yields rpa ) is gapped for small frequencies and at the antiferromagnetic wavevector @xmath44 , the value of this gap is determined as @xmath45mev @xcite where @xmath46 is the superconducting gap . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , above @xmath47 the imaginary part of the bare interband susceptibility shows the discontinuous jump implied by the bogolyubov coherence factor ( @xmath48 ) and the condition @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is true for the @xmath50-wave symmetry of the superconducting order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , the real part of the bare susceptibility is positive , diverges logarithmically at @xmath51 , and scales as @xmath52 at small frequencies@xcite . then , switching on the electron - electron interactions , we find within rpa that for any positive value of the interband interaction the total ( rpa ) spin susceptibility acquires a pole or _ </S>",
    "<S> spin exciton _ below @xmath47 with infinitely small damping . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , other than the gapping of the spin spectrum , the most salient point of our analysis is that it predicts a spin exciton at @xmath53mev in the superconducting state that is located at the same incommensurate wavevectors as paramagnons in the normal state , a feature that is clearly found in our ins data . </S>",
    "<S> we stress here that the spin exciton is a property of the superconducting state and requires opposite sign of the superconducting order at the corresponding wave vector , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that the actual spin gap in the neutron spectrum is smaller than @xmath55 which is again a consequence of the spin exciton formation in the superconducting state .    </S>",
    "<S> our itinerant rpa like description is obviously not sufficiently accurate to describe all the detailed features of the spin excitation spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the value for the incommensurability @xmath4 is smaller than the experimentally observed and the dispersion of the paramagnons are steeper than observed as shown in fig  [ lowe](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , our treatment captures the key points of the data , these being the incommensurate paramagnon excitations , the emergence of the spin gap and the superposition of the exciton in the superconducting state onto the paramagnon scattering .    at this point </S>",
    "<S> it is tempting to compare the structure in @xmath27  of the magnetic resonance between the iron based superconductors and the cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that there are two basic differences . </S>",
    "<S> first , in the iron based compounds the superconducting gap is almost constant at each of the fermi surfaces , though the magnitude of the gap may differ on each of the pockets . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the resonance is not expected to show any additional features like a downward dispersion , as found in the cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , in the iron based superconductors the main electronic interactions are local ( weakly momentum - dependent ) and smaller than the bandwidth . </S>",
    "<S> the resonance in the superconducting state is an additional feature to the initial structure of the magnetic susceptibility in the normal state , determined by the nesting the fermi surface pockets . </S>",
    "<S> once the nesting is incommensurate the resonance also shifts to the incommensurate wavevectors as we demonstrate in our measurements . to confirm this </S>",
    "<S> we have checked that if the nesting is restored the resonance returns to be fully commensurate . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to the cuprates where the fermi surface is far from being nested and the maximum intensity at @xmath56 of the spin response is a consequence of the momentum - dependent strong superexchange interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that there are intriguing similarities between this iron superconductor and the rare - earth- and actinide - based superconductors upd@xmath57al@xmath58@xcite , cecu@xmath57si@xmath57@xcite and cecoin@xmath59 @xcite . in all three compounds the magnetisation dynamics in the normal state </S>",
    "<S> are modulated in @xmath27 . in the superconducting state ( i ) </S>",
    "<S> the low energy response is suppressed by the formation of a gap , ( ii ) a resonance is formed at energies related to the superconducting gap energy and ( iii ) the higher energy dynamic response remains unchanged . in this iron superconductor @xmath2  is much higher than the rare - earth- and actinide - based superconductors making this behavior far clearer to observe .    to summarize , we find using inelastic neutron scattering that in the fete@xmath0se@xmath1 superconductor the magnetic resonance appears superimposed at the incommensurate wavevector as paramagnon excitations found in the normal state . </S>",
    "<S> our simple rpa model of the magnetic excitations on the basis of the @xmath5 symmetry of the superconducting order parameters can qualitatively reproduce the main features of the neutron scattering data . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement supports an itinerant character of the spin excitations in iron - based systems and a spin spectrum determined by the single poles of im@xmath60 with no extra contributions from localized moments . </S>",
    "<S> the success of this model stands in sharp contrast to the uncertainties still faced to fully understand the magnetic resonance in the cuprates .    </S>",
