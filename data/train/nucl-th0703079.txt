    "it has been suggested that one of the main signatures for the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , which is a state of matter that consists of deconfined quarks and gluons , could be the equilibration of anti - hyperons and multi - strange baryons @xcite .",
    "the idea was that within a hadron gas there would not be enough time for these particles to reach chemical equilibrium and thus they should be  born \" into equilibrium after the qgp phase transition @xcite . indeed , experimentally we know that the particle abundancies reach chemical equilibration close to the phase transition @xcite .",
    "multi - mesonic reactions within the standard hadron gas model , which can explain abundancies at sps energies @xcite , can not account for the short chemical equilibration times and high abundancies of anti - baryons at rhic @xcite ( but also see @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we focus on hagedorn resonances ( heavy resonances that have an exponential mass spectrum that appear near the critical temperature ) that drive multi - pionic reactions and also produce baryon anti - baryon pairs as was suggested in ref .  @xcite .",
    "once we include the hagedorn resonances we see that it is possible for the anti - baryons ( future work will discuss anti - hyperons and multi - strange baryons ) to quickly equilibrate within the fireball just  below \" the phase transition .",
    "originally , ( anti-)strangeness enhancement at cern - sps energies in comparison to @xmath0-data , which was primarily observed in anti - hyperons and multi - strange baryons , was thought of as a signature for qgp .",
    "using binary strangeness production reactions such as @xmath1 or binary strangeness exchange reactions @xmath2 it was concluded that it took far too long for chemical equilibrium to be reached within the hadron gas phase @xcite .",
    "thus , it was proposed that the qgp was already observed at sps because strange quarks can be produced more abundantly by gluon fusion , which would then account for strangeness enhancement in hadrons following hadronization and rescattering of strange quarks @xcite .    on the other hand , to explain secondary production of anti - hyperons the idea was suggested that strangeness enhancement could be explained using multi - mesonic reactions such as @xmath3 for the anti - protons @xcite and for the anti - hyperons @xmath4 found in ref .",
    "the anti - hyperons can be rewritten into the general equation @xmath5 the arrows in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : antiproton ] ) , ( [ eqn : antihypall ] ) signify the equal probability that a decay can occur in either direction otherwise known as detailed balance .",
    "the time scale of a standard hadron gas at sps can be then estimated using the multi mesonic reactions in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : antiproton ] ) , ( [ eqn : antihypall ] ) . using @xmath6",
    "the chemical equilibration time is then @xmath7 where @xmath8 , which is typical for sps @xcite .",
    "therefore , the time scale given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : prochemtime ] ) is short enough to account for chemical equilibration within the cooling hadronic fireball at sps .    if we apply our same understanding of the hadron gas phase to rhic temperatures our time scales are much longer .",
    "the equilibrium rate of @xmath9 at rhic at @xmath10 mev is @xmath11 where the cross section is @xmath12 and the baryon density is @xmath13 , which leads to a time scale of @xmath14 .",
    "however , considering that the fireball s time scale in the hadronic stage is @xmath15 , a standard hadron gas could not explain the apparent chemical equilibration observed in baryons within the fireball .",
    "moreover , these results were also backed up in ref .",
    "@xcite where using a fluctuation - dissipation theorem it was found that the equilibration time of baryons and anti - baryons , @xmath16 $ ] , at rhic temperatures . in the @xmath17 most central au - au collisions the baryon anti - baryon production is roughly three times lower than the measured experimental values if it starts out of equilibrium ( specifically at zero for reactions of type ( [ eqn : antiproton ] ) and ( [ eqn : antihypall ] ) ) shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : alambda ] ) , taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , for @xmath18 production .",
    "mev whereas the solid lines assume that the anti - lambdas begin in equilibrium .",
    "the shaded area shows the experimental results taken from ref .",
    "the set of lines shows the difference for varying coupling coefficients.,width=226 ]    because of the apparent differences in the equilibration times some have suggested that the hadrons are  born \" into equilibrium i.e. the system is already in a chemically frozen out state at the end of the phase transition @xcite .",
    "in this paper we use hagedorn states to provide the extra degrees of freedom needed to match experimental results when the anti - baryons begin out of equilibrium .",
    "baryon anti - baryon production develops according to the possible reaction @xmath19 which is initially discussed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the hagedorn states arethought as massive resonances with short time scales and only contribute near the critical temperature .",
    "they can then catalyze rapid equilibration of baryons and anti - baryons near @xmath20 .",
    "the results obtained here lead us to believe that the baryon anti - baryon pairs have sufficient time to equilibrate within the fireball close to the phase boundary .",
    "in the 1960 s hagedorn found a fit for an experimentally growing mass spectrum @xcite , @xmath21 , which is described as @xmath22 where the minimum mass is @xmath23 mev , the maximum mass is @xmath24 gev , the hagedorn temperature is @xmath25 mev , which fits within lattice qcd predictions @xcite , and @xmath26 is a free parameter . because of the exponential growth , near the hagedorn temperature the hagedorn states can account for the extra degrees of freedom needed to match experimental values .",
    "@xmath27 is then chosen by looking at the energy density and trying take into account the extra degrees of freedom needed .",
    "here we are considering only mesonic , non - strange hagedorn states with masses between @xmath28 gev .    to describe the dynamical behaviour of the hagedorn states we use rate equations .",
    "rate equations have both loss and gain terms and have the basic form @xmath29 we assume a system with no net baryon density i.e. @xmath30 .",
    "this should approximately be the case at rhic at midrapidity . for the reaction @xmath31 the behaviour of the density of the @xmath32 hagedorn resonance @xmath33 , pions @xmath34 , and baryon anti - baryon pairs @xmath35",
    "is described by the following set of equation : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the decay width , @xmath38 represents the branching ratios , and @xmath39 is the average number of pions that each hagedorn state decays into when a baryon anti - baryon pair is included .",
    "we also have two separate detailed balance factors , @xmath40 for the decay @xmath41 and @xmath42 for the decay @xmath31 .",
    "the detailed balance factors ensure that detailed balance is maintained in equilibrium .",
    "they are also temperature dependent because the equilibrium values of the density are dependent on the temperature .",
    "the branching ratios are described by a gaussian distribution @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the average pion number that each hagedorn state decays into and @xmath45 is the width of the distribution @xcite .",
    "the decay width @xmath46 , which has the range @xmath47 mev , is a linear fit extrapolated from the data from the particle data group @xcite . in the future",
    "we will also use a microcanonical model to find the branching ratios as shown in ref .",
    "we have solved the rate equations in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : networkbab ] ) considering several different initial conditions for a statistical system . at first",
    "we take the simplest example and observe only the decay @xmath41 when the pions are held in equilibrium .",
    "we then consider a resonance bath and allow the pions to equilibrate .",
    "we also allow both the pions and the resonances to develop until they reach equilibrium",
    ". then we include baryon anti - baryon pairs into our decay @xmath48 where at first the pions are held in equilibrium , then the hagedorn states , and also both the hagedorn resonances and the pions are held in equilibrium while the baryon anti - baryon pairs are allowed to equilibrate .",
    "finally , we consider the case when all the constituents are allowed to equilibrate simultaneously .      initially",
    ", when the hagedorn states decay only into multiple pions , @xmath41 we assume that the pions start in equilibrium and the hagedorn resonances start at zero , which could be an approximation for a physical system immediately following hadronization when the correlation lengths are very short",
    ". then we can make an estimate for the time scale with the inverse of the decay width @xmath49 .",
    "the equilibration time estimate is then between @xmath50 .",
    "mev.,width=226 ]    in fig .",
    "( [ fig : pionsineq ] ) the result of the rate equations is shown , which matches the time estimates well . from fig .",
    "( [ fig : pionsineq ] ) we see that the hagedorn states equilibrate quickly ( in comparison to typical expansion times ) .",
    "hence , they should be at chemical equilibrium as long as the pions are at chemical equilibrium .",
    "on the other hand , if the hagedorn resonances are held in equilibrium and treated like a resonance bath then we can define a new effective production rate for pions : @xmath51 which gives the range for the equilibration time @xmath52 . here",
    "the pions start at zero , which could be an approximation for a physical system immediately following hadronization when the correlation lengths are very long . again",
    "the time scale can be compared with the results from the rate equations , which is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : reineq ] ) .        indeed , the pion become populated very quickly towards chemical equilibrium for all temperatures .",
    "the most interesting case is when both the hagedorn states and the pions are out of equilibrium . the coupled network of rate equations is @xmath53 the right - hand side of the rate equations goes to zero when the particles are in equilibrium . in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : setresonances ] ) the resonances and pions reach a quasi - equilibrium configuration before full equilibrium is reached . in the quasi - equilibrium state",
    "the right - hand side nears zero and thus slows down the equilibration time , thus , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     although we only see a small deviation in the pions from equilibrium in fig .",
    "( [ fig : hs2pi0bab0 ] ) that minor deviation drastically affects the resonances because even the lightest resonance , whose mass is @xmath56 gev , decays on average into @xmath57 pions . in fig .",
    "( [ fig : hs2pi0bab0 ] ) we clearly see that quasi - equilibrium is reached quickly i.e. @xmath58 . after quasi - equilibrium is reached the remaining constituents ( especially the resonances ) slowly reach equilibrium .",
    "what we can get from fig .",
    "( [ fig : hs2pi0bab0 ] ) is that the pions and the baryon anti - baryon pairs quickly equilibrate , especially for higher temperatures . in the graph of the baryon anti - baron pairs we see that at @xmath59 mev the baryon anti - baryon pairs quickly populate near chemical equilibrium and",
    "while they are not in complete equilibrium are quite close to it .",
    "hence , for temperatures between @xmath60 mev , the baryon anti - baryon pairs are populated with equilibration times faster or equal to @xmath61 .",
    "this constitutes a very promising finding .",
    "our preliminary results and time scale estimates indicate that baryon anti - baryon pairs can be  born \" out of equilibrium after hadronization and then equilibrated by the subsequent population and decay of hagedorn states .",
    "cases 1 - 3 for the decay @xmath31 clearly show quick equilibration times for baryon anti - baryon pairs between temperatures of @xmath62 mev and @xmath63 mev i.e. slightly below the phase transition . when all the particles started out of equilibration the baryon anti - baryon pairs",
    "quickly neared equilibrium although a minor deviation was still observed from chemical equilibration .",
    "afterwards , due to affects from the need to kill of the number of effective pions in the system , longer time scales were observed when the pions , hagedorn states and baryon anti - baryon pairs were out of equilibrium .",
    "however , the pions and baryon anti - baryon pairs were quickly populated near @xmath64 and remained close to their equilibrium values even when it took longer for the hagedorn states to reach chemical equilibrium .",
    "since the hagedorn states only contribute near @xmath64 these appear to be acceptable results .    in an upcoming publication",
    "we will delve more thoroughly into the effects of the quasi - equilibrated state seen in both fig .",
    "( [ fig:2re0pi ] ) , ( [ fig : hs2pi0bab0 ] ) and we also will discuss its effects on the fireball as it cools over time due to a bjorken expansion .",
    "thus , we expect to see the baryon anti - baryon pairs quickly reach equilibrium and then they will not be produced further when the system is cooled .",
    "moreover , we will vary our choices of initial conditions and discuss their implications .",
    "finally , a non - zero strangeness will be included specifically in the baryon anti - baryon pairs so that we can study the equilibration times of anti - hyperons and multi - strange baryons .",
    "the continuation of our work is promising in order to explain results for strangeness in baryons and anti - baryons found at rhic .",
    "this work was supported by figss .",
    "j.n - h . would also like to thank jorge noronha for thoughtful discussions on this work .",
    "furthermore , it is a pleasure to thank the organizers of the xlv international winter meeting on nuclear physics , bormio 2007 for allowing us to present our results .",
