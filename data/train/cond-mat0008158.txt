    "<S> in a quasi - two - dimensional @xmath0-wave superconductor there find six cooper pairing states which are degenerate within the weak - coupling approach . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this degeneracy can be lifted by feedback effect favoring the so - called chiral @xmath0-wave state . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is based on the anomalous coupling between charge and current in a system with broken time reversal symmetry and parity .    # </S>",
    "<S> 1#2    the discovery of odd - parity cooper pairing in sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 led to the renewed interest in so - called p - wave ( spin - triplet ) superconductivity.@xcite there is a number of other systems , such as the heavy fermion superconductors upt@xmath3 and ube@xmath4 or the organic superconductor ( tmtsf)@xmath1pf@xmath5 , where very likely odd - parity pairing is realized.@xcite the spin-1 degree of freedom of the spin - triplet cooper pairs provides a considerably wider space of potential pairing states than in the even - parity ( spin singlet ) case.@xcite the symmetry and effective dimensionality of the electronic band structure plays an important role in determining the possible p - wave pairing states . </S>",
    "<S> the examples listed above cover many of the possibilities : the organic superconductor is quasi - one - dimensional , the heavy fermion compounds are three - dimensional , while sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 represents the case of quasi - two - dimensional system .    </S>",
    "<S> the large number of possible p - wave states makes their identification for each material a difficult task . </S>",
    "<S> a simple weak - coupling bcs type of approach can give a first guess on the most stable state . because the condensation energy is in this case </S>",
    "<S> directly connected with the presence of the energy gap in the quasiparticle spectrum , the state with the least nodes in the gap would be most favorable . in one and three dimensions the most stable state is unique up to spin rotation . </S>",
    "<S> assuming parabolic band structure for the corresponding dimension and using the d - vector notation one finds @xmath6 where the gap matrix is defined as @xmath7 and the quasiparticle gap is @xmath8 = |{\\bf d}({\\bf k } ) |^2 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> obviously the two states are nodeless on the corresponding fermi surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> note that the example for three dimensions corresponds to the balian - werthammer state or the b - phase of superfluid @xmath9he.@xcite    we now consider the case of as quasi - two - dimensional system which is characterized by the fact that the fermi surface is open in one direction , the @xmath10-axis . </S>",
    "<S> in such a system the weak coupling approach does not lead to a unique state , but we can find six degenerate states with the same nodeless gap . in sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 their degeneracy is lifted by spin - orbit coupling and the corresponding states labeled according to the representation of the tetragonal crystal point group of this compound is given in table 1.@xcite we can distinguish two types of states here : those which have @xmath11-vector that changes orientation for different points on the fermi surface belonging to the one - dimensional representation @xmath12 and @xmath13 and those which have a fixed @xmath11-vector orientation but a finite orbital angular momentum , belonging to the two - dimensional @xmath14 representation.@xcite note that the latter is the chiral state , i.e. it breaks time reversal symmetry and parity . </S>",
    "<S> since all these states are degenerate in the spin rotation symmetric case beyond simple spin rotation transformation , the question arises which among them is stable . for sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 experiments </S>",
    "<S> suggest the chiral state with @xmath15.@xcite    @cc @xmath16 & @xmath17 + a@xmath18 & @xmath19 + a@xmath20 & @xmath21 + b@xmath18 & @xmath22 + b@xmath18 & @xmath23 + e@xmath24 ( chiral states ) & @xmath25 +    in sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 the loss of spin rotation symmetry by spin - orbit coupling carries the main responsibility in picking the stable state . in this letter , however , we assume that the spin rotation symmetry is preserved in the normal state so that all states listed in table 1 have the same transition temperature @xmath26 as a solution of the linearized weak coupling gap equation . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the degeneracy must be lifted in a higher order process . </S>",
    "<S> a well - known concept introduced by anderson and brinkman is the spin fluctuation feedback mechanism.@xcite if paramagnon exchange plays a dominant role in the pairing interaction , the modification of the spin fluctuation spectrum by the superconducting condensation also alters the pairing interaction . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that this mechanism works in favor of the so - called amb - state or a - phase in @xmath9he.@xcite this mechanism applied to the 2d situation turns out to stabilize the time reversal breaking state which is indeed the analogue to the a - phase.@xcite    here we would like to introduce an additional feedback mechanism which does not exist in a neutral fermi liquid such as @xmath9he . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on the presence of chirality in the orbital part of pairing state and we will call it , therefore , _ chiral feedback mechanism_. it was shown that in the state @xmath27 a chern - simons - like term , @xmath28 appears in the effective low - energy field theory of a static quasi - two - dimensional system ( @xmath29 ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite consequently , charge fluctuations generate local magnetic field distributions ( @xmath30-axis oriented ) and current fluctuations lead to transverse electric field distributions , whose orientation depends on the chirality . </S>",
    "<S> this property yields an additional ( anomalous ) pairing interaction in the superconducting state which has selective power for chirality . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen by the following simple picture . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field induced by the charge of a quasiparticle acts via the lorentz force on a passing - by quasiparticle.@xcite this force is either attractive or repulsive depending on which side the quasiparticle trajectory is located ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) . in this way </S>",
    "<S> the interaction is attractive for one choice of cooper pair angular momentum ( chirality ) and repulsive for the other . </S>",
    "<S> the attractive interaction appears for the same chirality realized in the pairs of the condensate . </S>",
    "<S> hence this leads to a positive feedback for the chiral state . </S>",
    "<S> this effect does not exist for the other states .    </S>",
    "<S> we will now discuss the effect by explicitly calculating its contribution to condensation energy immediately below the transition temperature @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> we represent the @xmath31-vector by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a complex order parameter and @xmath34 inverse of the fermi wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> the band structure is simply parabolic @xmath35 without any dispersion along the @xmath36-axis leading to a cylindrical ( open ) fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the system has layered structure as sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 with an interlayer spacing @xmath37 leading to the density of states , @xmath38 , at the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> the anomalous pairing interaction appearing in the superconducting phase is connected with the density - current correlation function which for the 2d electrons has the form ( in the unit @xmath39 ) @xmath40   ~~(j=1,2 ) ,     \\label{den - cur}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the green s functions are @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 and @xmath44 as the fermionic and bosonic matsubara frequencies , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we express @xmath45 due to the gauge invariance . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath46 comes from the chirality and is written as @xmath47 close to @xmath26 we can restrict ourselves to the leading contributions in @xmath33 and obtain , @xmath48 where we sum over repeated indices . </S>",
    "<S> note that this expression is only finite for a chiral p - wave state . </S>",
    "<S> we restrict ourselves to static contributions and comment on the dynamical part later .    </S>",
    "<S> we now consider the @xmath49-dependence . </S>",
    "<S> we approximate @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the fermi velocity . in order to evaluate the integral we introduce cylindrical coordinates and perform first the integration over the radial part and @xmath10-component of @xmath52 , @xmath53 where @xmath54 . for small @xmath55 we may expand @xmath56 as @xmath57\\ ] ] where @xmath58 , @xmath59 defines the coherence length and @xmath60 is the zeta - function . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of @xmath61 for @xmath62 is dominated by the regions of the @xmath63-integral for which @xmath64 matching the limiting behaviors together we can approximate @xmath65 by the following form , @xmath66 which represents the form factor of parity and time reversal symmetry breaking part in @xmath67 .    the current - charge density interaction introduced via @xmath68 gives an additional contribution to the pairing interaction below the superconducting transition . as a feedback effect </S>",
    "<S> this appears in the gl free energy in a fourth - order correction expressed by @xmath69 following the diagram in fig.2 . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath70 , @xmath71 is the gauge field propagators which in coulomb gauge are , @xmath72 these propagators contain all renormalizations , i.e. thomas - fermi screening for the scalar potential with the screening length @xmath73 . since @xmath74 london screening of the superconductor can be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> we ignore here also the dynamical part for simplicity , as it would give the same contributions for all competing states .    </S>",
    "<S> if we separate the @xmath75-integration in @xmath76- and @xmath77-part , we obtain , @xmath78 after performing the @xmath79-integration the remaining @xmath80-integral has a cutoff @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the free energy correction , @xmath82 where we give an expression formally close to the conventional fourth - order terms in order to give a comparison of its magnitude . here </S>",
    "<S> we recover the constants @xmath83 and @xmath84 , the factor @xmath85 is the fine structure constant and the ratio @xmath86 indicates the strong coupling nature of the correction term , similar to the spin fluctuation feedback mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    for the chiral @xmath0-wave state @xmath87 and zero for all other states </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath88 denotes the chirality ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the correction to the fourth order term is negative definite and favors the chiral @xmath89-wave state . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio between this correction and the usual fourth order coefficient is @xmath90 which for sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 is of the order @xmath91 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to see that the dynamical contributions , taking into account @xmath92 , does not change the result qualitatively . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding coefficient in the free energy , however , increases . </S>",
    "<S> we have verified numerically that an increase of one order of magnitude is possible . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that other mechanisms , such as the spin fluctuation feedback or spin - orbit coupling , would dominate over the chiral feedback effect in stabilizing the chiral @xmath0-wave state . </S>",
    "<S> we would like to emphasize , however , that our analysis shows that for a quasi - two - dimensional @xmath0-wave superconductor the chiral feedback effect , based on the anomalous coupling between charge and current , supports the chiral superconducting phase and , thus , works in the same direction that the spin fluctuation feedback mechanism .    </S>",
