    "the concept of @xmath1-ordered graphs was introduced in 1997 by ng and schultz @xcite .",
    "a simple graph @xmath0 is a graph without loops or multiple edges , and it is called _ hamiltonian _ if there exists a cycle that contains all vertices of @xmath0 . in this paper",
    "we consider only connected finite simple graphs .",
    "a simple graph @xmath0 is called _ k - ordered _",
    "( respectively , _",
    "k - ordered hamiltonian _ ) , if for any sequence of @xmath1 distinct vertices @xmath2 of @xmath0 there exists a cycle ( respectively , hamiltonian cycle ) in @xmath0 containing these @xmath1 vertices in the specified order .",
    "previous results concerning cycle orderability focus on minimum degree and forbidden subgraph conditions that imply @xmath1-orderedness or @xmath1-ordered hamiltonicity @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive survey of results can be found in @xcite .    any hamiltonian graph is necessarily @xmath3-ordered hamiltonian as well as @xmath3-ordered , thus we study @xmath1-orderedness for @xmath9 .",
    "indeed , it is easy to see that hamiltonicity is equivalent to @xmath3-ordered hamiltonicity , and @xmath3-cyclability to @xmath3-orderedness ( a graph is said to be @xmath3-_cyclable _ , if for any three vertices of the graph there exists a cycle containing them ) .",
    "if @xmath0 is a hamiltonian graph of order @xmath10 , then @xmath0 being @xmath1-ordered hamiltonian implies that @xmath0 is @xmath11-connected ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the arguments made in @xcite hold in case of @xmath1-orderedness as well , namely , if @xmath0 is a graph of order @xmath10 , then @xmath0 being @xmath1-ordered implies that @xmath0 is @xmath11-connected .",
    "in particular , this implies that @xmath12 , the minimum degree of any vertex in a @xmath1-ordered graph @xmath0 is at least @xmath13 .    in @xcite , a search for small degree @xmath4-ordered hamiltonian graphs",
    "was conducted and an infinite family of @xmath4-regular @xmath4-ordered hamiltonian graphs was exhibited . however , the only two @xmath3-regular @xmath4-ordered hamiltonian graphs found were @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in this paper",
    "we analyze the class of all @xmath3-regular graphs with the aim of determining whether or not there exist other @xmath4-ordered ( and @xmath4-ordered hamiltonian ) @xmath3-regular graphs . in section",
    "@xmath14 we prove that a @xmath3-regular @xmath4-ordered graph on more than @xmath7 vertices is not only triangle free @xcite , but it is also square free and we show that the smallest ( by the number of vertices ) @xmath3-regular triangle and square free graph , namely the petersen graph , is @xmath4-ordered .",
    "we also consider a common family of graphs generalizing the petersen graph , and we show that the petersen graph itself is the only member of this family that is @xmath4-ordered . in section @xmath3 , we exhibit a @xmath4-ordered hamiltonian graph on @xmath15 vertices , the heawood graph , and show that it is the smallest graph after @xmath5 and @xmath6 that is @xmath3-regular and @xmath4-ordered hamiltonian . in section @xmath3",
    "we also exhibit forbidden subgraphs for @xmath3-regular and @xmath4-ordered hamiltonian graphs .",
    "finally , in section @xmath4 , we conclude our paper by constructing an infinite family of @xmath3-regular @xmath4-ordered graphs that we call torus - graphs ( torus - graphs can be embedded on the torus without crossing edges ) . since @xmath3-regular graphs have the lowest possible degree for @xmath4-ordered graphs , the construction of torus - graphs answers the question of whether there are low degree @xmath4-ordered graphs .",
    "it is easy to see that no @xmath3-regular @xmath4-ordered hamiltonian graph on more than @xmath4 vertices contains a triangle ( see @xcite ) .",
    "also , @xmath3-regular @xmath4-ordered graphs must be triangle free , by an analogous argument .",
    "a @xmath3-regular @xmath4-ordered graph on more than @xmath7 vertices does not contain a square .",
    "suppose @xmath0 is a @xmath4-ordered graph on more than @xmath7 vertices and it contains a square .",
    "by @xmath4-orderedness , @xmath0 is triangle free , as noted before .",
    "if there exists a square , say with vertices @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ( in order ) such that some pair of edges incident to opposite vertices of the square @xmath20 do not share a vertex , then we can show that @xmath0 is not @xmath4-ordered . indeed , suppose without loss of generality , that the third edge incident to @xmath16 is @xmath21 , that the third edge incident to @xmath18 is @xmath22 , and that @xmath23 . in this case",
    ", there can be no cycle in @xmath0 containing the vertices _ f , e , c , a _ in this order because @xmath22 and @xmath21 can not be edges in this cycle , which implies that _ ab , bc , cd , da _ are all edges in this cycle , which contradicts the existence of a cycle containing vertices _",
    "f , e , c , a _ in that order .",
    "we now show that @xmath6 is the only @xmath3-regular triangle free graph containing a square such that the edges incident to opposite vertices of any square it contains do share a vertex . indeed , suppose @xmath24 is a @xmath3-regular triangle free graph containing a square @xmath20 , such that the edges incident to opposite vertices of any square it contains do share a vertex . then , there exists a vertex @xmath25 and a vertex @xmath26 such that such that @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath22 are edges .",
    "as @xmath24 is triangle free , it follows that @xmath23 .",
    "consider the square @xmath30 in @xmath24 , and its opposite vertices @xmath19 and @xmath26 . by assumption , the edges incident to opposite vertices of any square in @xmath24 share a vertex , and as the degree of @xmath19 is already @xmath3 , it follows that @xmath31 is an edge in @xmath24 . as all of the vertices @xmath32 already have degree @xmath3 it follows that @xmath24 is the graph on these six vertices with edges as described .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath33 .",
    "if @xmath0 is a @xmath3-regular @xmath4-ordered graph on more than @xmath7 vertices , then every vertex has exactly @xmath7 vertices at distance @xmath14 .    note that in a @xmath3-regular graph @xmath0 any vertex has @xmath34 , or @xmath7 vertices at distance @xmath14 . by theorem 2.1 , in order for graph @xmath0 on more than @xmath7 vertices to be @xmath4-ordered , it has to be square free .",
    "observe that if there is a vertex @xmath35 that has @xmath36 , or @xmath37 vertices at distance @xmath14 , then @xmath35 is a vertex of a square in @xmath0 .",
    "thus , if @xmath0 is a @xmath3-regular @xmath4-ordered graph on more than @xmath7 vertices , then each vertex of @xmath0 has exactly @xmath7 vertices at distance @xmath14 .",
    "the next two lemmas will be used to prove theorem  [ pet4 ] , in which we show that the smallest @xmath3-regular graph that is triangle and square free is @xmath4-ordered .",
    "this graph is the well - known petersen graph , ( see figure  [ pet ] ) .",
    "a _ walk _ is a sequence of ( not necessarily distinct ) vertices @xmath38 such that @xmath39 is adjacent to @xmath40 for all @xmath41 .",
    "the length of a walk is the number of edges in the walk .",
    "following @xcite , an _",
    "n - route _ is a vertex disjoint walk of length @xmath42 with specified initial point .",
    "a graph @xmath0 is _ n - transitive _ , @xmath43 , if it has an @xmath42-route and if there is always an automorphism of @xmath0 sending each @xmath42-route into any other @xmath42-route .    _",
    "( @xcite , p.175 ) _ the petersen graph is @xmath3-transitive .",
    "the following well - known fact follows from lemma 2.3 :    given any two @xmath37-cycles in the petersen graph , there exists an automorphism that takes one of the @xmath37-cycles into the other .",
    "[ pet4 ] the petersen graph is 4-ordered .",
    "consider the petersen graph as shown in figure  [ pet ] , and consider @xmath4 vertices @xmath44 specified in order in the petersen graph .",
    "we consider three cases depending on how the @xmath4 vertices are distributed : either all @xmath4 specified vertices are among vertices _ a , b , c , d , e _ , or @xmath3 of them are from _ a , b , c , d , e _ , or @xmath14 of them are from _ a , b , c , d , e_. call the cycle containing the vertices _ a , b , c , d , e _ the _ outer cycle _ , and the cycle containing the vertices _ f , h , j , g , i _ the _ inner cycle _ of the petersen graph .",
    "consider the case when there are @xmath3 vertices specified on the outer cycle , and @xmath45 vertex specified on the inner cycle . without loss of generality , the vertex on the inner cycle can be specified to be the first vertex , @xmath46 , and the @xmath3 vertices specified on the outer cycle the second , third , and forth , @xmath47 .",
    "we now show that in this case regardless of exactly which @xmath4 vertices @xmath44 are , there is a cycle containing them in this order .",
    "let @xmath48 and @xmath49 be the vertices on the inner cycle that are adjacent to @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "go from @xmath46 on the inner cycle _ f - h - j - g - i _ until @xmath48 , without meeting @xmath49 .",
    "then go from @xmath48 to @xmath50 , and from @xmath50 go to @xmath52 and then to @xmath51 on the outer cycle _ a - b - c - d - e_. from @xmath51 go to @xmath49 and then to @xmath46 without meeting @xmath48 .",
    "this completes the cycle that contains @xmath44 in this order .",
    "thus , by lemma 2.4 , if there are exactly @xmath3 of the @xmath4 specified vertices on any @xmath37-cycle in the petersen graph , then we have a cycle containing the @xmath4 vertices in the specified order .",
    "this observation makes it unnecessary to check the case of all @xmath4 vertices being among vertices _ a , b , c , d , e _ , as in this case there is a @xmath37-cycle containing exactly @xmath3 of the specified vertices .",
    "furthermore , in the case that @xmath14 of the specified vertices are from _ a , b , c , d , e _ , and @xmath14 from _ f , g , h , i , j _ it suffices to consider the case when these @xmath4 vertices are in relative positions as _ a , c , i , j _ since in all other cases there is a @xmath37-cycle containing @xmath3 of the specified vertices . for these remaining cases ,",
    "one can easily find a cycle containing the vertices no matter how we specify their order .",
    "we now consider a common family of graphs generalizing the petersen graph and show that the petersen graph itself is the only member of this family that is @xmath4-ordered , although they are all @xmath3-ordered hamiltonian with the exception of the petersen graph ( @xcite , p.136 ) .",
    "a _ star graph _ @xmath53 , where @xmath54 are positive integers , is a graph on vertices @xmath55 such that @xmath56 and @xmath57 are adjacent if the indices @xmath58 and @xmath59 differ by @xmath1 modulo @xmath42 .",
    "the _ generalized petersen graph _",
    "@xmath60 , @xmath61 , is a graph consisting of an cycle of length @xmath42 on the vertices @xmath62 , @xmath63 ,  , @xmath64 ( in order ) and a star graph @xmath65 on vertices @xmath66 , such that @xmath56 and @xmath67 are adjacent for all @xmath68 .",

    "the thick lines denote edges in the graph , and the thin line denotes the circle upon which the star graph is drawn .",
    "note that if @xmath75 , then @xmath76 and @xmath77 in figure  [ genpet ] ; however , this has no effect on the following arguments .    in figure  [ genpet ]",
    "we also marked vertices _ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 _ and we now show that there is no cycle containing these vertices in this specified order . indeed , suppose that there is such a cycle @xmath18 . as _ 13 _ and _ 24 _ are edges that can not occur in @xmath18 , it follows that @xmath18 must contain edges _",
    "j1 , 1a , a2 , 2h , i4 , 4b , g3 , _ and _ 3c _ ; and since _",
    "1-a-2 _ is a path in @xmath18 this also shows that the edges _",
    "j1 , 1a , a2 _ , and _",
    "2h _ are oriented from their first vertex to the second ( i.e. , @xmath78 is oriented from @xmath59 to @xmath45 , etc . ) . as _",
    "hk _ and _ hj _ are the remaining edges from _ h _ , and _",
    "j1 _ is an edge in @xmath18 , it follows that @xmath18 contains _ hk _ with this orientation .",
    "also , as _ il _ and _ ik _ are the remaining edges from _ i _ , and _",
    "k _ has been visited when we were going from _ 2 _ to _ 3 _ , it follows that @xmath18 contains the edge _ il_. as _ kh , ki _ , and _ ke _ are the edges from _ k _ , and edge @xmath79 has been used , and @xmath80 can not be used as it would create a path in @xmath18 directly from _ 2 _ to _ 4 _ , it follows that @xmath18 contains the edge _ ke _ with this orientation .",
    "because edge @xmath81 can not be in @xmath18 , the edge @xmath82 must be in @xmath18 , with this orientation . if the edge @xmath83 were in @xmath18 , then there would be a direct path in @xmath18 from _ 3 _ to _ 1 _ , which is impossible ; and thus @xmath84 must be an edge in @xmath18 .",
    "but then there is a closed cycle from _ 1 _ to _ 2 _ and back to _ 1 _ in @xmath18 , which is also impossible , giving us a contradiction .",
    "in this section we show that the heawood graph , the smallest @xmath3-regular graph that is triangle , square , and pentagon free ( @xcite , p. 42 ) , is @xmath4-ordered hamiltonian ( figure  [ hea ] ) .",

    "observe that in order to prove that the diameter is @xmath3 , it suffices to check that all vertices are at distance less than @xmath4 from @xmath35 and there is a vertex at distance @xmath3 from @xmath35 , which is easily done . in order to show that if two vertices @xmath85 and @xmath86 of the heawood graph are at distance 3 , then there are two disjoint paths of length @xmath3 between @xmath85 and @xmath86 , it suffices to find two vertices @xmath85 and @xmath86 at distance @xmath3 with two disjoint paths between them , say @xmath87 and @xmath88 , which is easily done .",
