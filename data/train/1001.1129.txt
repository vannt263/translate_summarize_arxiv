    "sakharov has suggested several decades ago that the baryon asymmetry of the universe may be dynamically generated if three conditions are met [ 1 ] .",
    "the three sakharov conditions are the violation of the baryon number conservation , the violation of both c and cp , and the deviation from thermal equilibrium . among them , the deviation from thermal equilibrium is the most intricate and challenging condition for theoretical models to satisfy . in order to ensure sufficient deviation from thermal equilibrium , the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) should be strongly first order , since otherwise the baryon asymmetry generated during the ewpt would subsequently disappear .",
    "in general , the electroweak symmetry of the universe is spontaneously broken as the universe is cooled down from very high temperature to the present temperature . in between the cooling process , the shape of the potential of the universe at a critical temperature would have two local minima for the first - order ewpt .",
    "one minimum corresponds to the original symmetric - phase state and the other one the broken - phase state .",
    "the strength of the ewpt is measured by comparing the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs field at the broken - phase state with the critical temperature .",
    "if the critical vev is larger than the critical temperature , the first - order ewpt is said to be strong .",
    "a number of supersymmetric models have been investigated within the context of the ewpt for the electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "several authors have investigated the mssm to show that a strongly first - order ewpt is only possible in a confined parameter region where a scalar top quark is lighter than the top quark and the other scalar top quark is as heavy as the susy breaking scale of 2 tev [ 2 - 5 ] .",
    "then , in order to avoid the light scalar top quark , other models extended from the mssm have also been investigated for the possibility of a strongly first - order ewpt , such as the non - mssms [ 6 - 19 ] and the mssm with four generations of fermions [ 20,21 ] .",
    "the non - mssms are different from the mssm in the sense that there is a trilinear term of the singlet higgs field accounting for the effective @xmath0 term .",
    "the trilinear term between higgs singlet and doublets of the non - mssms allows the mass of the scalar top quark to be sufficiently large .",
    "thus , the non - mssms have some parameter regions where a sufficiently strong first - order ewpt may occur for electroweak baryogenesis , without requiring a light scalar top quark .",
    "recently , it has been found that if the fourth generation of fermions is introduced to the mssm , it is possible to have a strongly first - order ewpt without a light scalar top quark in terms of the thermal contribution of the scalar quarks of the fourth generation [ 20,21 ] .    in this article , we study another model , the mssm with vector - like quarks within the context of the electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "it has been proposed some years ago [ 22,23 ] , and its higgs sector has been extensively investigated recently [ 24 - 28 ] .",
    "there are three ways to introduce the chiral superfields to the mssm , maintaining the perturbative gauge unification with the masses of new extra chiral supermultiplets at the tev scale [ 28 ] . among them",
    ", we pay attention to the specific model , where two vector - like quarks are present .",
    "this model is similar to the que model in ref .",
    "[ 28 ] , except that we do not consider an additional chiral lepton superfield .",
    "our model is therefore actually the mssm with two additional chiral superfields , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which are defined to transform under @xmath3 as @xmath4 these additional chiral superfields introduce new physical vector - like quarks , namely , two charge @xmath5 quarks @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and one charge @xmath8 quark @xmath9 , together with their scalar superpartners , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the presence of the vector - like sector in the mssm alters the phenomenology of the mssm with respect to the ewpt .",
    "our study shows that in our model a strongly first - order ewpt is possible at the one - loop level , without requiring a light scalar top quark .",
    "the superpotential of our model may be written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the superpotential of the mssm , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the masses of the vector - like quarks , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the yukawa coupling coefficients to the weak hypercharge @xmath20 and @xmath21 higgs doublets @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the higgs superfields @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the tree - level higgs potential of the mssm is given as @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are the mass parameters , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the gauge coupling coefficients for @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "two of the mass parameters , @xmath28 and @xmath27 , may be eliminated using the minimum equations with respect to the neutral higgs fields .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , as the neutral higgs fields develop vevs , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , five physical higgs bosons emerge : two neutral scalar higgs bosons , @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , one neutral pseudoscalar higgs boson , @xmath39 , and a pair of charged higgs bosons , @xmath40 .",
    "we assume that the vevs as well as the parameters of the higgs potential are all real .",
    "note that the tree - level mass of @xmath36 can be expressed in terms of just two parameters , @xmath29 and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 . the tree - level mass of @xmath36 is smaller than the @xmath43 boson mass .",
    "let us consider the decoupling limit where @xmath36 remains light at the electroweak scale and all the other higgs bosons become very heavy with masses of the order of the susy breaking scale or a few tev . in this limit",
    ", the higgs sector reduces to the higgs sector of the standard model ( sm ) at the electroweak scale and the coupling coefficients of @xmath36 to gauge bosons and fermions are identical to the couplings of the sm higgs boson , @xmath44 .",
    "thus , in the decoupling limit , one can not distinguish the phenomenology of @xmath36 from that of @xmath44 , hence the same experimental lower bound on the mass of @xmath36 as the sm higgs boson which is about 114.4 gev as set by the lep2 experiments [ 29 ] .",
    "hereafter , we confine ourselves in the decoupling limit and denote the lighter neutral scalar higgs boson as @xmath44 : @xmath45 in terms of @xmath44 , the tree - level higgs potential at zero temperature may be written as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is related to the mass of the lighter neutral scalar higgs boson at the tree level and @xmath48 represents the quartic higgs self - coupling coefficient .",
    "let us first study the higgs potential of our model at zero temperature .",
    "the tree - level higgs potential of our model at zero temperature is essentially identical to the tree - level higgs potential of the mssm .",
    "however , the one - loop level higgs potential of our model differs from the corresponding mssm higgs potential , since additional contributions from the loops of the vector - like quarks and the vector - like scalar quarks enter into the radiative corrections to the higgs potential of our model . at zero temperature",
    ", the one - loop effective potential of our model may be written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the radiative corrections at zero temperature .",

    "note that the difference in size between @xmath72 and @xmath73 causes a relatively small mass splitting between @xmath55 and @xmath55 , whereas the opposite sign of @xmath78 in the above expressions indicates that the mass eigenstates of scalar top quarks are mixtures of the weak eigenstates .",

    "we note that , in the mssm , the strength of the first - order ewpt increases as the mass of the pseudoscalar higgs boson increases .",
    "thus , the decoupling limit may be considered as an optimal situation for the first - order ewpt to be sufficiently strong , since the mass of the pseudoscalar higgs boson is already very large .",
    "however , the decoupling limit alone may not be enough for the mssm to achieve the desired phase transition , since in this limit the mssm higgs sector resembles the sm higgs sector and it has already been observed that the sm higgs sector can not successfully generate the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "hence , the mssm requires a different mechanism in addition to the decoupling limit for the strongly first - order ewpt .",
    "our study suggests that the introduction of vector - like quark sector may be a possible mechanism .",
    "the existence of the vector - like quarks and scalar quarks not only enhance the strength of the first - order ewpt in our model , but also alleviate the requirement that the mass of a scalar top quark should be lighter than the top quark mass",
    ".    the strength of the first - order ewpt in our model is affected by the values of the relevant parameters .",
    "our numerical analysis shows that it is enhanced as the mass of the lightest scalar higgs boson decreases .",
    "also , if we reduce the value of @xmath165 , the parameters that account for the mixing among the vector - like scalar quarks , the strength of the ewpt increases .",

    "<S> in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , a strongly first - order electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) is only possible in a confined parameter region where one of the scalar top quarks is lighter than the top quark and the other one is as heavy as the susy breaking scale . if the mssm is enlarged to accommodate vector - like quarks and their superpartners , we find that the strongly first - order ewpt is possible without requiring light scalar top quark at the one - loop level , in the limit where the lightest scalar higgs boson of the mssm behaves like the higgs boson of the standard model and the other higgs bosons are all as heavy as the susy breaking scale . </S>",
