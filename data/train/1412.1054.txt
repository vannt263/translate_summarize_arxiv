    "quantum correlations arise from the combination of the superposition principle and the tensor product structure of the hilbert space associated with a composite quantum system . for pure states ,",
    "they are entirely captured by entanglement . on the other hand , in the case of mixed states ,",
    "the situation becomes more involved , as there can exist mixed separable ( i.e. non - entangled ) states that nevertheless can display non classical features  @xcite .",
    "the existence of such states suggests that the total amount of quantum correlations is not , in general , quantified only by the entanglement but needs to be characterized also in terms of another quantity , related to quantum state distinguishability , the so - called quantum discord .",
    "entanglement and discord are fundamental resources for quantum information and quantum metrology  @xcite , as well as quite useful tools for the characterization of quantum phases in many - body systems  @xcite .",
    "for instance , topologically ordered phases can not be characterized by the landau - ginzburg paradigm based on symmetry breaking and local order parameters , but rather by the long - range entanglement properties featured by the ground state of the system  @xcite . within this generalized framework ,",
    "quantum correlations ( entanglement and discord ) in many - body ground states allow for the most fundamental characterization of complex quantum systems .",
    "in fact , even for systems that do not feature exotic phases and nonlocal quantum orders , the investigation of ground - state patterns of entanglement and discord can provide a deeper understanding of locally ordered phases associated to spontaneous symmetry breaking  @xcite .    in spite of the ongoing efforts to characterize quantum ground states by analyzing their quantum correlations , a systematic comparative study of the behavior of entanglement and discord in quantum many - body systems is still lacking . in the present work",
    "we carry out such direct comparison within the powerful unified framework to the quantification of entanglement and quantum correlations , based on the formalism of local unitary operations , introduced in refs .  @xcite . in the above - mentioned works",
    ", it has been shown that the distance between a given state and the state obtained from it by applying a least perturbing local unitary operation is a _ bona fide _ measure of entanglement , the so - called entanglement of response ( or _ unitary entanglement _ )  @xcite , in the case of pure states . in the case of mixed states , it is a _ bona fide _ measure of quantum correlations ( discord ) , the so - called discord of response  @xcite .",
    "we apply these distance - based measures to investigate the ground - state behavior of pairwise entanglement and discord in the one - dimensional @xmath0 models in a transverse magnetic field with periodic boundary conditions . within the set of well - behaved distances , featuring the correct properties of monotonicity under completely positive and trace preserving ( cptp ) dynamical maps , we pick the trace distance ( other possible relevant choices would include , e.g. , the relative entropy , the bures , and the hellinger distance ) .",
    "we show that the pairwise discord of response is always larger than the pairwise entanglement of response , and strongly dominates it in symmetry - preserving ground states , particularly for large inter - particle distances and at the factorizing field ( this last fact being trivial , since at the factorizing field the pairwise entanglement always vanishes identically ) .    for symmetry - breaking ground states ,",
    "we observe that while the hierarchy between discord and entanglement continues to hold , nevertheless , compared to the symmetry - preserving case , the pairwise discord is strongly suppressed while the pairwise entanglement remains either unchanged or increases slightly for decreasing values of the external field below the factorization point . moving from the trace distance , which is monotonically non - increasing under cptp maps , to the hilbert - schmidt distance ,",
    "that does not share such a property , we show that in symmetry - breaking ground states the physically correct hierarchy is reversed : the pairwise discord of response is dominated by the entanglement of response .",
    "this unphysical result thus provides an important illustration of the fact that the hilbert - schmidt metric does not yield a proper and correct quantification of quantum correlations ( a first well - known example was provided earlier by piani in ref .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : definitionsandnotationsofstellarentandquant ] we review the unifying approach to the quantification of quantum correlations based on local unitaries , by recalling the definitions of the entanglement and discord of response . in section  [ sec : xymodel ] we recall the main features of the one - dimensional @xmath0 models in transverse field with periodic boundary conditions . in sections  [ sec : symmetricgroundstate ] , [ sec : symmmetrybrokengroundstate ] and [ sec : thermalstate ] we perform the comparison between the entanglement of response and the discord of response for spin pairs in infinite @xmath0 chains ( thermodynamic limit ) , respectively in symmetry - preserving and symmetry - breaking ground states , as well as in thermal states at finite temperature .",
    "conclusions and outlook are discussed in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we start by briefly reviewing some basic definitions and results concerning the quantification of entanglement and quantum correlations via local unitary operations . throughout the present work",
    ", we will focus on a bipartite quantum system @xmath1 composed of two distinguishable subsystems @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "such quantum system is associated with an hilbert space which is the tensor product of the hilbert spaces pertaining to each subsystem , so that . moreover , the space of states of @xmath1 is characterized by the convex set of density operators ( i.e. semi - positive definite and trace - class operators with unit trace ) on @xmath4 , whose extremal points are the unit - trace projectors over @xmath4 that represent pure states .",
    "let us denote by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , a generic pure state of the bipartite quantum system @xmath1 and the set of local unitary operators @xmath7 such that @xmath8 is the identity operator on @xmath9 and @xmath10 is any unitary operator on @xmath11 whose spectrum is given by the @xmath12-th complex roots of unity .",
    "the _ entanglement of response _  @xcite of @xmath13 , @xmath14 , is defined by : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the trace distance between the states @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in other words ,",
    "when the whole quantum system @xmath1 is in a pure state @xmath13 , the entanglement of response quantifies the quantum correlations between parts @xmath2 and @xmath3 in terms of the distinguishability between the state @xmath13 and the state @xmath20 obtained from @xmath13 by applying to it a minimally perturbing local unitary transformation .",
    "there are at least two distinct ways to extend the entanglement of response to mixed states : the convex roof extension , which then identifies the entanglement of response of mixed states , and the _ discord of response _ defined directly as the distance between a given mixed state and the one obtained from it through the action of the least perturbing local unitary operation  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the _ entanglement of response _ of a bipartite mixed state @xmath21 , @xmath22 , is defined as : @xmath23 where the minimization is performed over all the decompositions of @xmath21 in pure states @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 . on the other hand ,",
    "the _ discord of response _ of a bipartite state @xmath21 , @xmath27 , is defined as  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for earlier related work ) : @xmath28 where , as in the case of pure states , @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , the entanglement and the discord of response quantify different aspects of bipartite quantum correlations via two different uses of local unitary operations .",
    "the discord of response arises by applying local unitaries directly to the generally mixed state @xmath21 , while the entanglement of response stems from the application of local unitaries to pure states . by virtue of their common origin",
    ", it is thus possible to perform a direct comparison between these two quantities .    in terms of the trace distance ,",
    "the two - qubit entanglement of response is simply given by the squared concurrence  @xcite , whereas the two - qubit discord of response relates nicely to the geometric discord  @xcite , whose closed formula is known only for a particular class of two - qubit states  @xcite , although it can be computed for a more general class of two - qubit states through a very efficient numerical optimization .",
    "in this section we recall some key aspects of the quantum many body systems we shall focus on , that is the one - dimensional anti - ferromagnetic @xmath0 models in transverse field with periodic boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "such quantum spin models consist of a periodic chain of @xmath30 @xmath31-spins , with anisotropic nearest - neighbor spin - spin interactions competing with a transverse magnetic field , whose dynamics is governed by the following hamiltonian : @xmath32\\!.\\ ] ] here @xmath33 , @xmath34 , are the pauli matrices on site @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the anisotropy in the @xmath37 plane , @xmath38 is the strength of the transverse magnetic field , and the periodic boundary conditions imply that @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath0 models reduce to the isotropic @xmath40 model and to the ising model for @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "regardless of the value of @xmath36 , in the thermodynamic limit , these models feature a quantum phase transition at @xmath43 . for @xmath44 and for any value of @xmath36 ,",
    "the ground state space is non - degenerate and there is a finite gap in the energy spectrum between the ground state and the first excited state . on the other hand , for @xmath45 ,",
    "two different cases arise : for @xmath46 the ground state space remains non - degenerate while the energy spectrum becomes gapless , whereas for @xmath47 the ground state space becomes two - fold degenerate , the energy spectrum is gapped , and the system can be characterized by a non vanishing local order parameter @xmath48 ( spontaneous on - site magnetization ) . besides the quantum critical point , there exists another relevant value of the external magnetic field , that is @xmath49 , the _ factorizing field_. indeed , at this value of @xmath38 ,",
    "the system admits a two - fold degenerate , completely factorized ground state  @xcite .",
    "the two degenerate factorized states collapse onto a single state for @xmath46 .",
    "this corresponds t the isotropic , gapless @xmath40 model , for which the factorizing field and the critical field coincide : @xmath50 .",
    "since our goal is to compare the two - spin entanglement of response and the two - spin discord of response , we need to determine the pairwise reduced density matrix @xmath51 both in symmetry - preserving and symmetry - breaking ground states , as well as thermal states at finite temperature .",
    "the pairwise reduced density matrix @xmath51 is defined as the partial trace on the state of the whole chain with respect to all spins except those at sites @xmath35 and @xmath52 .",
    "while the ground state of the entire chain is a pure state , the reduced state of a pair of spins is in general mixed .",
    "the two - site density matrix can be expanded as follows  @xcite : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the identity on site @xmath35 , and @xmath55 denotes the two - body correlation function between @xmath33 and @xmath56 .",
    "the operator expansion in eq .",

    "however , this number can be reduced by resorting to the symmetries of the hamiltonian .",
    "translational invariance of the lattice implies that the reduced density matrix depends only on the inter - spin distance @xmath58 . also , since the hamiltonian is real , @xmath59 .",

    "obviously , thermal effects also remove and/or distort the ground - state factorization phenomenon , that occurs at zero temperature for @xmath49 .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig : thermalentandquantversushatvarioust ] shows that , as the temperature varies , @xmath70 either belongs to a region where @xmath72 vanishes identically , or is a regular point at which @xmath72 is strictly nonzero .",
    "accordingly , as soon as the temperature @xmath115 increases from zero to some finite value , the discords evaluated for different inter - spin distances do not coincide anymore when @xmath74 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : thermalentandquantversushatvariousr ] ) .",
    "@xmath113{thermalnextnearestquantversustatvarioush } \\includegraphics[height=2.75cm]{thermalnextnearestentversustatvarioush } \\end{array } $ ] @xmath113{firstderthermalnextnearestquantversustatvarioush } \\includegraphics[height=2.75cm]{firstderthermalnextnearestentversustatvarioush } \\end{array } $ ]    from fig .",
    "[ fig : thermalentandquantversushatvarioust ] it also emerges that , as the temperature @xmath115 increases , the peaks corresponding to @xmath72 and @xmath81 tend to flatten to zero quite differently , with the pairwise discord being more robust than the pairwise entanglement against thermal effects .",
    "interestingly , figs .",
    "[ fig : thermalentandquantversustatvarioush ] and  [ fig : thermalnextnearestentandquantversustatvarioush ] show that , for any anisotropy @xmath36 , there exist some values of the external field @xmath38 such that either the pairwise entanglement or the pairwise discord increase with the temperature .",
    "this contrasts the common intuition for which thermal effects can only be detrimental to quantum features .",
    "furthermore , this surprising behavior appears mostly in the case of the pairwise discord .",
    "indeed , the latter increases with the temperature for many values of the external field @xmath38 and any sufficiently small inter - spin distance @xmath84 , whereas the pairwise entanglement displays such behavior only for particular values of @xmath38 and , essentially , in the case of pairs of nearest - neighboring spins .",
    "more precisely , for sufficiently large anisotropy @xmath36 , @xmath81 increases with the temperature for all values of the external field @xmath38 except for those belonging to a small interval around and including the critical point @xmath76 . for sufficiently small @xmath36",
    ", @xmath81 increases with the temperature for all values of the external field @xmath38 except for those belonging to an interval that lies below the critical point @xmath76 and shifts towards lower values of @xmath38 as @xmath36 decreases .",
    "consequently , there is no correspondence between the growth of the pairwise discord with the temperature and the occurrence of a gap in the energy spectrum between the ground state and the first excited state .",
    "in this paper , by resorting to a unifying approach to the quantification of bipartite quantum correlations based on local unitary operations , we have performed the first , direct and comprehensive , comparison between the two - body entanglement and two - body quantum discord in infinite @xmath0 quantum spin chains , both in symmetry - preserving and symmetry - breaking ground states as well as in thermal states at finite temperature .    for symmetry - preserving ground states",
    ", we have shown that the pairwise entanglement captures only a modest portion of the total pairwise quantum correlations .",
    "this fact is trivially obvious at the factorizing field and quite intuitive for long - range inter - spin distances : in both cases , the pairwise entanglement vanishes .",
    "conversely , for symmetry - breaking ground states , we have shown that the pairwise quantum correlations are strongly suppressed in the whole ordered phase @xmath45 , while the pairwise entanglement is either unchanged or undergoes a slight enhancement , thus contributing the largest amount to the total pairwise quantum correlations . when adopting the hilbert - schmidt distance , we have also found that the two - body discord of response can be even smaller than the corresponding entanglement , thus providing a fundamental physical illustration of the fact that the hilbert - schmidt distance , being non contractive under cptp maps , does not allow for a proper quantification of quantum correlations .",
    "for thermal states at finite temperature , we have shown that the pairwise discord of response is in general more robust than the pairwise entanglement against thermal effects .",
    "moreover , we have also shown that a surprising resilience to thermal effects can occur both for the pairwise discord and the pairwise entanglement , whereby these quantum features can , in some regions of the hamiltonian parameters , increase with the temperature , although this behavior appears most enhanced in the case of the pairwise discord .",
    "the fact that pairwise quantum correlations and pairwise entanglement can increase with the temperature in some regimes of the hamiltonian parameters , together with the complex behavior of the maximum pairwise entanglement and discord as functions of the anisotropy are two puzzling features whose physical origin is at present not fully understood and thus deserves further investigation .",
    "it is finally worth remarking that in order to directly compare entanglement and quantum discord on equal footing , one might resort to other unifying approaches to the quantification of entanglement and quantum correlation besides the one based on the formalism of local unitary operations that we have used in the present work .",
    "it would then be interesting to see what conclusions can be drawn by comparing entanglement and quantum correlations , e.g. within the unifying geometric approach .",
    "in such approach , entanglement and quantum discord are quantified in terms of the distance from the set of , respectively , the separable and the classical - quantum states  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one might consider the approach defining quantum correlations as the corresponding entanglement that is necessarily created between system and apparatus during local measurements  @xcite .",
