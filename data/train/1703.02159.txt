    "reaction - diffusion systems play an important role as models for a large variety of spatio - temporal systems arising from various fields : chemistry , physics , mechanics , genetics , ecology  .",
    "an relevant concept for the understanding of their dynamical behaviour is the dominance of equilibria , @xcite : given two stable homogeneous equilibria , in which sense can one say that an equilibrium `` dominates '' the other one  ?",
    "a possible answer is ( see for instance @xcite ) : equilibrium @xmath0 dominates equilibrium @xmath1 if there exists a travelling front connecting these two equilibria and displaying invasion of @xmath1 by @xmath0 ( even if the order relation induced by this definition is not always antisymmetric , see the example in appendix , ) .",
    "a natural related question is that of the influence of mobility on dominance : how is the speed of a front connecting two stable equilibria ( and in particular the sign of this speed ) affected by a change in the diffusion coefficients  ?",
    "this question is relevant in the context of population dynamics .",
    "consider a system modelling the evolution of densities of two species competing in a one - dimensional environment . in this case one",
    "expects the existence of two stable equilibria , each corresponding to the dominance of a species , for the local reaction system .",
    "the question above is that of the influence of the mobility of each of the two species on their relative fitness , that is on the sign of the speed of a front connecting these equilibria .",
    "one may believe that less mobility is always advantageous , since it reduces the dispersal at the interface where the two species coexist , and thus prevents invasion ( see the observations in @xcite ) .",
    "but other effects can be invoked : an increase in the mobility of , say , the first species , changes the total density of individuals on each side of the interface , and results in undercrowding on the side where first species dominates and overcrowding on the other side , an effect having unclear consequences . while according to results of a. hastings @xcite and j. dockery et al .",
    "@xcite a heterogeneous environment seems to be always in favour of a reduction of dispersal , v. hutson and g. t. vickers made on a model the numerical observation that large or small diffusion can not unambiguously be claimed to be favourable in general , @xcite .",
    "more recently , l. girardin and g. nadin considered a lotka ",
    "volterra competition model close to the infinite competition limit and proved in this case a `` unity is not strength '' result stating that a large dispersal is favoured , @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to examine on some cases the value of the first order dependence of the speed of a bistable front with respect to a perturbation of the diffusion matrix , and to try to determine the sign of this quantity .",
    "first we consider a general reaction - diffusion system in spatial dimension one , governing two symmetric scalar components , and assume the existence of two stable homogeneous equilibria that are symmetric ( with respect to exchange of the two components ) and connected by a symmetric ( thus stationary ) front .",
    "then the symmetry between the two scalar components is broken by a small perturbation of the diffusion matrix ( say a small increase of the diffusion coefficient of the first component ) and several expressions are provided for the first order dependence of the speed of the front with respect to this perturbation ( [ sec : general ] ) , together with a geometric interpretation for some of these expressions .",
    "all this suggests that both signs may occur for this first order dependence , depending on the features of the initial system .",
    "two specific examples are then considered .",
    "first ( [ sec : toy ] ) a toy example where the initial standing front is explicit , and where it is shown that both signs ( for the first order dependence introduced above ) actually occur , depending on the value of a parameter of the system .",
    "this confirms on a computable case the aforementioned observations of hutson and vickers .",
    "the second example ( treated in [ sec : lv ] ) is the lotka  volterra competition model in the bistable regime , close to the onset of bistability .",
    "using singular perturbation arguments , it is shown in this case that a large dispersal is advantageous .",
    "let us consider the reaction - diffusion system : @xmath2 where the time variable @xmath3 and the space variable @xmath4 are real , space domain is the full real line , the field variable @xmath5 is @xmath6-dimensional ( @xmath6 is a positive integer ) , the `` reaction '' function @xmath7 is smooth , and the `` diffusion '' matrix @xmath8 is a positive definite symmetric @xmath9 real matrix .",
    "let us assume that this system admits two distinct spatially homogeneous equilibria , in other words that there exist two points @xmath10 and @xmath11 in @xmath12 such that @xmath13 and let us assume that there exists a travelling front connecting these two equilibria , in other words that there exist a smooth function @xmath14 and a real quantity @xmath15 such that the function @xmath16 is a solution of system [ react_diff ] and such that @xmath17 this function @xmath18 is a global solution of the system : @xmath19 let us assume in addition that both equilibria @xmath10 and @xmath11 are hyperbolic ( that is the linear functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 have no eigenvalue with zero real part ) .",
    "in this case both functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 approach @xmath24 at an exponential rate when @xmath25 approaches @xmath26 , and as a consequence these functions belong to the space @xmath27 . let us denote by `` @xmath28 '' the canonical scalar product in @xmath12 , and let @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the usual scalar product and corresponding norm in @xmath27 , namely ( for every pair @xmath31 of functions of @xmath27 ) : @xmath32 now , it follows from system [ syst_front ] that the quantity @xmath15 admits the following explicit expression : @xmath33    if the reaction function @xmath34 derives from a potential @xmath35 ( namely if @xmath36 for all @xmath5 in @xmath12 ) then this expression of @xmath15 becomes : @xmath37 thus , in this case , the sign of the speed @xmath15 of the front only depends on the sign of the difference between @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in particular , if there exist several travelling fronts connecting @xmath10 to @xmath11 , then all the velocities of these fronts have the same sign .",
    "such is not always the case when @xmath34 does not derive from a potential : it is not difficult to construct an example of system of the form [ react_diff ] where two distinct equilibria are connected by two travelling fronts with velocities of opposite signs ( for sake of completeness such an example is given in appendix , see ) .    in the following",
    "we shall not assume that @xmath34 derives from a potential .",
    "our aim is to understand the influence of a small change in the diffusion matrix @xmath8 on the speed @xmath15 of the travelling front @xmath18 .",
    "let us introduce the space coordinate @xmath40 in a frame travelling at speed @xmath15 .",

    "the profile @xmath47 of the travelling front considered in [ subsec : setup ] is a steady state of system [ react_diff_trav_frame ] .",

    ": :    the spatially homogeneous equilibria @xmath10 and    @xmath11 at both ends of the front are spectrally stable for    the reaction - diffusion system [ react_diff ] .",
    "in other words , for every real quantity @xmath54 , all eigenvalues of the @xmath9 real matrices @xmath55 have negative real parts ( the subscript `` stab - ends '' refers to : `` stable at both ends of space '' ) .",
    "equivalently , the essential spectrum of operator @xmath56 is stable @xcite .    : :    the eigenvalue zero of the operator @xmath56 has an    algebraic multiplicity equal to @xmath57 .    in other words , the kernel of operator @xmath56",
    "is reduced to @xmath58 , and the function @xmath59 does not belong to @xmath60 .",
    "the subscript `` transv '' refers to : `` transverse '' ; indeed , this hypothesis is equivalent to the transversality of the travelling front ( see ) .",
    "the two next definitions call upon a topology on the space of travelling fronts , which may be chosen as follows : two travelling fronts @xmath61 and @xmath62 travelling at speeds @xmath63 and @xmath64 are close if : there exists a translate of @xmath62 that is close to @xmath61 ( uniformly on @xmath65 ) , and the two speeds @xmath63 and @xmath64 are close .    the travelling front @xmath18 is said to be _ isolated _ if there exists a neighbourhood of it such that every other travelling front of the same system [ react_diff ] in this neighbourhood is equal to a translate of @xmath18 ( and as a consequence travels at the same speed ) .    the travelling front @xmath18 is said to be _ robust _ if every sufficiently small perturbation of system [ react_diff ] possesses a unique ( up to space translation ) front close to @xmath18 and travelling with a speed close to @xmath15 .",
    "the following statement is a rather standard transversality result @xcite .",
    "[ prop : robustness ] it follows from hypotheses and that the travelling front @xmath18 under consideration is isolated and robust .    for sake of completeness a proof of this proposition",
    "is provided in .      the travelling front @xmath18 is said to be _ spectrally stable _ if hypotheses and are satisfied , and if moreover every nonzero eigenvalue of @xmath56 has a negative real part . in this case",
    "the travelling front is then also _ non linearly stable with asymptotic phase _ , that is for every function @xmath66 sufficiently close ( say uniformly on @xmath65 ) to a translate of @xmath18 , there exists a real quantity @xmath67 such that the solution of system [ react_diff ] with initial condition @xmath68 approaches the solution @xmath69 ( at an exponential rate ) when @xmath3 approaches @xmath70 @xcite",

    "if @xmath85 is positive , then , for @xmath80 small positive , the influence of the perturbation will be to increase the speed of the front , thus to promote @xmath10 with respect to @xmath11 ; * if conversely @xmath85 is negative , then again for @xmath80 small positive , the influence of the perturbation will be to decrease the speed of the front , thus to promote @xmath11 with respect to @xmath10 .",
    "we are now going to provide a second expression of @xmath85 that will turn out to be useful , and in particular easier to interpret than the solvency condition [ solv_cond ] .",

    "now let us consider a more specific situation , assuming that the reaction system is two - dimensional , and that the two `` species '' under consideration are completely symmetric for this system , before the perturbation .",
