    "the most important benefit of using a wireless medium is to have more reliable communication for users in terms of mobility , but it will have its own disadvantages such as communication coverage , interference between users ( or channels ) , fading behavior of transmission channels and transmission power . managing the interference is an issue to overcome when users in wireless networks want to have at the same time an acceptable quality of service ( qos ) and higher transmission rates . rather than avoiding the interference , it can be used in an intelligent way to recover the desired information for an intended receiver .",
    "this interference management technique is called ia .",
    "cof protocol in wireless communication is a novel relaying strategy in which relays can decode or compute the functions of transmitted signals from different transmitters , then forward them to the intended destination . by using this protocol interference",
