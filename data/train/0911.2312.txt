    "based on the mechanisms described above , carrier injection essentially leads to a change in the refractive index .",
    "another significant contribution to the refractive index change is caused by the plasma absorption of the free carriers : electrons in the conduction band for the @xmath0-doped case or the electrons and holes for the photoexcited case .",

    "[ fig10 ] and [ fig11 ] .",
    "it can be observed that the refractive index change due to @xmath0-type doping is much higher in inn compared to gan for both wavelengths .",
    "there are several reasons behind this outcome .",
    "first of all there is a cancellation that occurs for gan ; as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , bgr very effectively cancels the burstein - moss shift up to a density of 10@xmath1  @xmath2 .",
    "the lack of such a cancellation in inn is because of the very strong band - filling effect as a result of small density of states of inn close to conduction band edge , see the inset in fig .",
    "furthermore , contrary to the case in inn , the refractive index change in gan due to band filling is positive up to the ultraviolet .",

    "we further assume that these photocarriers quickly thermalize to their respective band edges and attain a degenerate quasiequilibrium distribution .",
    "since the electron - hole pairs will eventually recombine within a time scale of 300 - 400  ps,@xcite the quasicontinuous optical excitation should replenish this in order to sustain the assumed steady - state carrier distribution .",

    "compared to the @xmath0-doped case in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , we observe two new features around 0 and 0.94  ev which are caused by the intravalence band transitions : the former is due to very low energy transitions at the valence band maximum ( left inset in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] ) , whereas the latter is the result of the @xmath5 transition ( right inset in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] ) .",
    "it is the latter that makes a significant impact around 1.55  @xmath4 m ( 0.8  ev ) and even more so at the 1.3  @xmath4 m wavelength ( 0.954  ev ) .",

    ", there are other theoretical estimations , such as the plasmon - pole@xcite and the vashishta - kalia@xcite models .",

    "however , as we stated previously , in the photoexcited case we still use the berggren - sernelius expression but with the reduced electron - hole effective mass . essentially , the same discussion also applies for the plasma contribution in eq .",

    "results for inn,@xcite our band structure is in good overall agreement .",
    "nevertheless , there remain further discrepancies of most of these theoretical results from the experimental data .",

    "moreover , the characteristic urbach energy parameter in high - quality inn samples turn out to be as low as 7.5 to 15  mev which indicates that these features are anchored to just below the band gap.@xcite    being intended as a bulk study , this work neglects any surface effects , the most important of which is the surface charge accumulation causing built - in electric field and band bending.@xcite in this regard , it has been mentioned by kudrawiec _",

    "<S> based on the full band electronic structure calculations , first we consider the effect of @xmath0-type doping on the optical absorption and the refractive index in wurtzite inn and gan . </S>",
    "<S> we identify quite different dielectric response in either case ; while inn shows a significant shift in the absorption edge due to @xmath0-type doping , this is masked for gan due to efficient cancellation of the burstein - moss effect by the band gap renormalization . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , for high doping levels the intraband absorption becomes significant in inn . for energies below 1  </S>",
    "<S> ev , the corresponding shifts in the real parts of the dielectric function for inn and gan are in opposite directions . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we observe that the free - carrier plasma contribution to refractive index change becomes more important than both band filling and the band gap renormalization for electron densities above 10@xmath1  @xmath2 in gan , and 10@xmath3  @xmath2 in inn . as a result of the two different characteristics mentioned above , the overall change in the refractive index due to </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0-type doping is much higher in inn compared to gan , which in the former exceeds 4% for a doping of 10@xmath1  @xmath2 at 1.55  @xmath4 m wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we consider intrinsic inn under strong photoexcitation which introduces equal density of electron and holes thermalized to their respective band edges . the change in the refractive index at 1.55  @xmath4 m </S>",
    "<S> is observed to be similar to the @xmath0-doped case up to a carrier density of 10@xmath3  @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the photoexcited case this is now accompanied by a strong absorption in this wavelength region due to @xmath5 intravalence band transition . </S>",
    "<S> our findings suggest that the alloy composition of in@xmath6ga@xmath7n can be optimized in the indium - rich region so as to benefit from high carrier - induced refractive index change while operating in the transparency region to minimize the losses . </S>",
    "<S> these can have direct implications for inn - containing optical phase modulators and lasers . </S>"
