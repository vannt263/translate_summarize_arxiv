    "our knowledge of the laws of physics in the sub - nuclear domain ( at distance scales of about @xmath0 cm and smaller ) is for the most part derived from analyzing the outcomes of high - energy collisions of elementary particles .",
    "while the size and sophistication of each component of high - energy collision experiments have steadily grown , the basic experimental setup has remained unchanged since late 1960 s .",
    "first , a particle accelerator uses a carefully designed combination of electric and magnetic fields to produce narrowly focused beams of energetic particles ( typically electrons , protons , and their antiparticles ) .",
    "then , two beams collide head - on , usually with equal and opposite momenta so that the center - of - mass frame of the colliding system coincides with the laboratory frame .",
    "the region where collisions occur ( the  interaction point \" ) is surrounded by a set of particle detectors , which attempt to identify the particles coming out of the collision , and measure their energies and momenta .    since physics at subatomic distance scales",
    "is governed by laws of quantum mechanics , the outcome of each collision can not , as a matter of principle , be known ahead of time ; the best that any theory can do is to predict the _ probabilities _ of various possible outcomes .",
    "modern collider experiments collect and analyze outcomes of huge number of collisions ; the number of events with specified properties within the collected data set is proportional to the probability of such an event .",
    "thus , the probability of a specific outcome of a collision ( or a closely related quantity typically used in particle physics , the _ cross section _ ) provide a natural bridge between theory and experiment .",
    "narrowly speaking , one can say that a particle theorist s job is to infer laws of physics from experimentally measured cross sections .",
    "there is no known algorithm that can do this job .",
    "( this is lucky for us , since otherwise theorists could be replaced by computers ! ) there is , however , a well - developed formalism for predicting cross sections , given a lagrangian quantum field theory . in practice , therefore , theoretical interpretation of collider data proceeds by picking a candidate theory , computing relevant cross sections within that theory , comparing with data , and ( if the comparison does not work ) moving on to the next candidate theory . for the last 30 years , the default  leading candidate",
    "\" theory has been the standard model ( sm ) . as everyone knows , no statistically significant deviation from predictions of this theory has been observed so far , although at times mild inconsistencies with data have motivated theorists to try alternative candidates .",
    "it is , of course , equally well known to the tasi participants that strong theoretical reasons exist to expect that the sm hegemony will finally break down at the energy scales around a tev , which will be explored experimentally for the first time by the large hadron collider ( lhc ) in the next few years .",
    "obtaining detailed quantitative predictions for the lhc experiments , both from the sm and from alternative candidate models , is a crucial task for theorists in the lhc era .",
    "the aim of these lectures is to introduce tasi students to some of the basic concepts and theoretical tools necessary to make such predictions .",
    "consider a collision of two elementary particles , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , in the reference frame where the net momentum of the pair is zero .",
    "this frame is called the _ center - of - mass frame _ , or _ c.o.m .",
    "frame _ for short , since the center of mass of the system is at rest . in the case of @xmath3 colliders , @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    "are just the electron and the positron , and the c.o.m .",
    "frame coincides with the lab frame . for hadron colliders , @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    "are partons ( quarks or gluons ) , and the c.o.m .",
    "frame , which we will also call the _  parton frame \" _ in this case , is generally moving along the collision axis with respect to the lab frame . in either case",
    ", we will neglect the masses of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , since they are tiny compared to the energies we re interested in ( of order 10 gev and higher ) . by convention , we will choose the @xmath4 axis to lie along the direction of the @xmath1 momentum .",
    "the four - momenta of the colliding particles are p_a = ( e,0,0,+e ) ,  p_b = ( e,0,0,-e ) .",
    "the total energy of the colliding system , the _ center - of - mass energy _",
    ", is @xmath5 .",
    "we will also frequently use the mandelstam variable @xmath6 . in the case of hadron colliders , the center - of - mass energy in a collision of two partons will be denoted by @xmath7 , to distinguish it from the energy of the colliding hadron pair @xmath8 .    in particle colliders ,",
    "collisions actually take place between beams containing large number of particles . if two beams collide head - on , the number of collisions leading to a final state with particular characteristics ( type of particles , their momenta , etc . )",
    "should be proportional to the number of particles in each beam , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and inversely proportional to the beams cross - sectional area @xmath11 .",
    "the coefficient of proportionality is the _ scattering cross section _ for this particular final state : = .",
    "if beams collide at a frequency @xmath12 hz , the rate @xmath13 ( number of events of a particular kind recorded per second ) can be written as r = l , where l = is the",
    "_ instantaneous luminosity_. simple as it looks , eq .   is a fundamental cornerstone of collider physics , and it is worth examining it more closely .",
    "the rate @xmath13 is measured directly by experimentalists . , where @xmath14 is the _ detector efficiency _ : the probability that an actual event with particular properties is identified as such by the detector .",
    "efficiencies vary widely depending on the detector and the kind of process one is considering .",
    "in addition , the measured rate typically includes events that do _ not _ actually have the requested properties , but are mis - identified due to detector imperfections . in these lectures , we will mostly not be concerned with such detector effects , except for an occasional brief comment .",
    "an interested reader is referred to eva halkidakis lectures at this school . ]",
    "the quantity @xmath15 ( together with @xmath16 ) contains all the information about the accelerator needed to analyze the experiment .",
    "experimental collaborations carefully monitor and record @xmath15 , as a function of time .",
    "the experimentally measured value of the cross section is inferred from eq .  .",
    "this value can then be compared with the theoretically expected cross section .",
    "[ tab : colliders ]    throughout the lectures , we will contrast theoretical predictions with data from recent and ongoing experiments at energy - frontier colliders .",
    "table  [ tab : colliders ] shows the basic parameters of these colliders , along with the upcoming lhc and the proposed next - generation electron - positron collider , the international linear collider ( ilc ) .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that , for hadron colliders , the listed center - of - mass energy corresponds to the colliding ( anti)protons .",
    "since high - energy processes are initiated by partons , which only carry a fraction of the proton momentum , the energy scales that can be probed at a hadron collider are substantially lower than this energy , typically by factors of @xmath17 depending on the process .",
    "electron - positron colliders , on the other hand , are able to explore many reactions at energy scales extending all the way to their nominal @xmath8 .",
    "the luminosity values shown in the table are the _ integrated _ luminosities , @xmath18 over the lifetime of the experiment .",
    "the table also lists the detectors at each collider .",
    "detector names coincide with the names of collaborations of physicists operating them , and are frequently used to refer to the data published by these collaborations .",
    "computing and interpreting cross sections will be our main focus .",
    "it is clear from its definition , eq .",
    ", that the cross section has cgs units of @xmath19 .",
    "a unit typically used in experimental nuclear and particle physics is 1 _ barn _",
    "@xmath20 @xmath19 . in  theory units \" , @xmath21 , the natural unit for cross section is gev@xmath22 ;",
    "the conversion factor is 1  bn & = & 2568  gev^-2,1  gev^-2 & = & 3.89410 ^ -4  bn . to get a very rough estimate of cross sections expected in particle physics experiments",
    ", we can use dimensional analysis : away from thresholds and resonances , the only energy scale in a collision of two massless particles is @xmath16 , and we should expect the ( total ) scattering cross section to behave roughly as ~. a similar result ( larger by @xmath23 ) is obtained by replacing the colliding particles with classical  billiard balls \" of radius equal to their compton wavelength @xmath24 , and taking their geometric cross section as an estimate .",
    "the geometric cross section also coincides with the upper bound on the total inelastic cross section ( assuming @xmath25-wave scattering ) from unitarity considerations .",
    "the cross sections for specific processes are typically lower , by an order of magnitude or more , than this bound : for example , the @xmath26 cross section on resonance ( @xmath27 ) is about 40 nb , compared to @xmath28 nb .",
    "the decrease of cross sections with energy has an important implication for accelerator design : colliders operating at higher center - of - mass energies must also have higher luminosity , adding to the technical challenges of expanding the high - energy frontier .",
    "this trend is clear in table  [ tab : colliders ] .",
    "the  master formula \" for evaluating the cross section and kinematic distributions for a @xmath29 scattering process is d= ( _ i=1^n ) ( 2)^4 ^4(p_a+p_b - p_i ) | m ( p_a , p_b\\ { p_i } |^2 , where @xmath30 is the invariant matrix element , a.k.a . _ scattering amplitude _ , and @xmath31 are the 4-momenta of the final - state particles .",
    "note that @xmath30 contains all information specific for the process under consideration ( such as coupling constant dependence , etc . )",

    "while eq .   is written in the center of mass frame of the colliding particles , it is in fact invariant under boosts parallel to the collision axis .",
    "this feature will be important when hadron collisions are considered .",
    "if the colliding beams are unpolarized , one needs to average the quantity @xmath32 over all possible initial - state polarizations .",
    "if the beams are polarized ( this was the case at the slc , and may be implemented at the ilc ) , an appropriately weighted average should be computed instead .",
    "in addition , if the final - state particles have spin , @xmath32 should typically be summed over all possible spin states , since no collider detector is capable of detecting spins of individual particles .",
    "( exception occurs when the final - state particles decay promptly , in which case the angular distribution of their decay products may carry information about their polarization state . ) the appropriately averaged and/or summed @xmath33scattering amplitude@xmath34 will be denoted by @xmath35 .",
    "the number of independent kinematic variables in a @xmath29 process is @xmath36 . in practice ,",
    "the initial state is always symmetric under rotation around the collision axis , and no physical observable can depend on the overall azimuthal coordinate , leaving @xmath37 physical variables .",
    "the simplest case , most commonly encountered in practice , is @xmath38 scattering .",
    "the only observable not constrained by energy and momentum conservation is the scattering angle @xmath39 , which by convention is defined as the angle between the 3-momenta of particles @xmath1 and @xmath40 .",
    "the differential cross section is given by =    & + 0 &    where |*p*_1|=. in the most common case of equal masses in the final state , @xmath41 , this formula further simplifies ( for @xmath42 ) to = .",
    "note that the square - root factor is simply the velocity of the final - state particles ( in units of @xmath43 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath35 is often expressed in terms of the _ mandelstam variables _ , lorentz - invariant ( scalar ) bilinears of the 4-momenta of incoming and outgoing particles . in the case of @xmath38 scattering , these are s & = & ( p_a+p_b)^2,t & = & ( p_a - p_1)^2,u & = & ( p_a - p_2)^2 .",
    "they are not independent : it can be easily shown that @xmath44 .",
    "the mandelstam variables are related to the scattering angle : for example , if @xmath45 , we simply have t = - ( 1- ) ,  u = - ( 1 + ) .",
    "the main advantage of using mandelstam variables comes in applications of crossing symmetry to relate processes such as , for example , electron - positron annihilation @xmath46 and compton scattering @xmath47 .",
    "they are also convenient for analyzing hadron collisions , being invariant under boosts connecting the parton and lab reference frames .",
    "in this lecture , we will study a few examples of reactions initiated by electron - positron collisions , and use them to illustrate some fundamental concepts and issues central to the field . since colliding particles are elementary , @xmath3 collisions are somewhat easier to analyze than collisions between hadrons , which will be discussed in lecture  [ sec : hadrons ] .",

    "moreover , below @xmath254 , the pdf s of all light quarks and antiquarks are roughly the same ; this is because most of them come from gluon splittings , which are flavor - blind and produce equal number of @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "( the strange and charm pdf s are suppressed due to their mass , but the effect is not strong . at @xmath255 ,",

    "the reason is that , as @xmath121 is increased , new partons are added that come from collinear splittings of the original partons .",

    "the reason for this apparent contradiction is that we used the _ leading - order _ parton - level cross section in our calculation .",
    "when radiative corrections are included , the parton - level cross section itself becomes @xmath121-dependent .",
    "for example , at nlo in @xmath186 , the parton - level cross section contains a contribution from the process @xmath259 , but only gluons with @xmath260 should be included .",

    "most studies of this kind roughly follow the  twelve - step \" blueprint outlined below .    1 .",
    "suppose that our model predicts a particle @xmath226 , and we would like to design a search for this particle .",

    "there is no need to derive precise feynman rules yet ; simply list the vertices involving @xmath226 and sm states .",
    "2 .   given the vertices , identify @xmath226 production mechanisms at the collider of interest . draw feynman diagrams with @xmath226 in the final state",
    "remember that cross sections generally decrease with the number of interaction vertices and with the number of particles in the final state , so focus on drawing diagrams as simple as possible .",
    "if considering a hadron collider , remember that pdf s drop fast with @xmath235 , and therefore cross sections decrease with the invariant mass of the final state .",
    "this implies that the final states with highest cross sections will involve as few heavy particles as possible .",
    "if the new particle can be singly produced , this will be the dominant process ; if single production is forbidden by symmetries ( e.g. r - parity in supersymmetric models ) , pair - production will dominate .",
    "3 .   based on the above considerations ,",
    "identify the most promising production processes for @xmath226 .",
    "you can also order diagrams according to the strength of couplings that enter : for example , @xmath349 , so , everything else being equal , qcd - mediated processes will have higher cross sections than electroweak reactions . 4 .   carefully derive the feynman rules for all vertices that enter the promising production processes .",

    "the signature of the higgs depends crucially on its mass .",

    "it is impossible to identify the higgs events on top of this huge background , and one is forced to focus on either subleading production processes , or subdominant decay modes . at the tevatron , the most promising strategy is to focus on @xmath387 but look for associated production events , @xmath388 and @xmath389 , with leptonic vector boson decays .",

    ", one can concentrate instead on a rare but very clean decay @xmath391 . in the high - mass region , on the other hand , the dominant decay mode is @xmath392 ( with one of the @xmath301s off - shell for @xmath393 gev ) , and @xmath394 also makes a significant contribution for @xmath395 gev . if the vector boson decays leptonically , these modes do not suffer from large qcd backgrounds , and provide a clean signature .",
    "the  golden \" @xmath396 mode is especially advantageous since it contains no invisible particles , so the higgs boson shows up as a clear peak in the 4-lepton invariant mass distribution .",
    "combined with the strong gluon fusion production channel , the vector boson decays make the search in the high - mass region relatively straightforward , giving the tevatron and especially the lhc sensitivity to high higgs masses in spite of the decreasing production cross section .",
    "the latest published results of the sm higgs searches at the tevatron are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : tev_hbound ] . to present the negative results of the searches ,",
    "the experiments assume that the higgs production cross section in each channel is a free parameter , and put an upper bound on this cross section .",

    "this bound , expressed in units of the sm production cross section for each higgs mass , is plotted on the figure .",
    "the sm higgs can be said to be ruled out if the cross section bound in these units is below 1 .",
    "currently , the tevatron experiments only exclude the sm higgs at the 95% c.l . in a narrow mass window just above the @xmath392 decay threshold , between 163 and 166 gev . as the integrated luminosity increases",
    ", the tevatron is expected to expand this window , unless a deviation from the sm is seen .",
    "lhc experiments are expected to be sensitive to the entire theoretically consistent range of the higgs masses at the 5-sigma level with about 30 fb@xmath397 of data , see fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc_hsens ] .",
    "this corresponds to 3 years of running at design luminosity , although of course depending on the higgs mass such sensitivity may be achieved much sooner . note that , just as at the tevatron , the lhc sensitivity is not a monotonic function of the mass :",
    "in fact , a 300-gev higgs is substantially easier to discover , via the @xmath396 mode , than a 115-gev higgs where one must rely on the rare decay @xmath391 .",
    "as every tasi student knows , the discovery of the higgs would mark the beginning , not the end , of the hunt for new physics at the tev scale .",
    "strong theoretical arguments indicate that the sm higgs can not live in isolation , requiring other new particles to stabilize its mass and complete the electroweak symmetry breaking sector .",
    "the nature of these new particles can at present only be guessed at .",
    "one popular guess is that physics at the tev scale is _ supersymmetric _ : for each particle in the sm , a new  superpartner \" particle appears at this scale , with the same quantum numbers but spin different by @xmath398 . appearing in loops , these particles would cancel the notorious quadratic divergence of the higgs mass parameter present in the sm , restoring naturalness to the higgs sector .",
    "i will not have the opportunity for a thorough review of the model here ; a reader in need of such a review is referred to the set of lectures by p.  fox at this school , as well to the excellent review article by martin  @xcite and the comprehensive book by baer and tata  @xcite .",
    "instead , i will simply very briefly mention the features of the model crucial for collider searches .",
    "[ tab : mssm_particles ]    the particle content at the tev scale predicted by the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is summarized in table  [ tab : mssm_particles ] .",
    "there are 34 new particles waiting to be discovered !",
    "notice the appearance of 3 additional higgs boson states not present in the sm ; this is due to the presence of a second higgs doublet field , required in the mssm for theoretical consistency .",
    "all other listed particles are simply superpartners of known sm states . if supersymmetry were an exact symmetry of nature , all superpartners would have exactly the same mass as their sm counterparts ; of course , this possibility is already completely ruled out by data .",
    "thus , susy must be broken , lifting the superpartner masses into the tev domain .",
    "( larger masses would render susy irrelevant for solving the hierarchy problem . )",
    "many models have been proposed to describe susy breaking ( some promising directions were described by p.  meade and d.  shih at this school ) . however , despite over two decades of intense theoretical work , no completely compelling model has yet emerged . in the absence of clear theoretical predictions , a conservative approach is to simply consider a completely general susy breaking lagrangian , imposing only the restriction that susy breaking must be  soft \" , to not interfere with the susy solution to the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "such general soft lagrangian contains about 100 free parameters , including all superpartner masses , as well as certain trilinear couplings among scalar superpartners ( so - called  a - terms \" ) .",
    "the superabundance of free parameters is a curse on the study of susy signatures at colliders : search strategies should ideally be designed that cover as much of the huge parameter space as possible , and , equally daunting , the results of each search should be presented as exclusion regions in this space . in practice , this challenge has not been met : most searches are planned and executed in terms of simplified models that impose relations among parameters , with the 5-parameter _  minimal supergravity \" , _ or msugra , model being the most common choice .    in spite of the many free parameters , it is possible to identify generic qualitative features of collider events with superparticles . to avoid rapid proton decay",
    ", the mssm postulates an additional discrete symmetry , the r - parity .",
    "this is a @xmath399 symmetry , _ i.e. _ any physical particle is either odd or even under it .",
    "every term in the lagrangian must be even , so that an even number of r - odd particles must appear in each interaction vertex predicted by the theory .",
    "all known sm particles , as well as all higgs scalars , are postulated to be r - even .",
    "the r - parity is embedded in the susy algebra in such a way that superpartners must have opposite r - charges ; in other words , all superpartners of the sm particles are odd .",
    "this has two consequences , both crucial for collider searches :    * superpartners must be _ pair - produced _ in collisions of sm particles .",
    "* the lightest superpartner ( lsp ) must be _ stable _ , and any other superpartner must decay to the lsp plus ( any number of ) r - even particles , either sm or extra higgses .",
    "strong cosmological bounds on electrically charged and colored stable particles indicate that , if the mssm is indeed realized in nature , the lsp should be one of the uncharged , uncolored particles of the model .",
    "there are three possibilities : the lightest neutralino @xmath400 , the lightest sneutrino @xmath401 , or the gravitino @xmath402 .",
    "of the three , the neutralino is an especially interesting possibility , since it can easily have the correct relic abundance to explain the observed dark matter , without conflict with direct dark matter search experiments .",
    "( the neutralino also naturally emerges as the lsp in several popular models of susy breaking , including msugra . )",
    "all these particles interact with ordinary matter too weakly to leave a trace in collider detectors , and so they would appear invisible , like the sm neutrino . thus , the generic signature of susy at colliders is the excess of events with  missing momentum \" , accompanied by the sm particles from decays of the originally produced superpartners to the lsp .",
    "this qualitative prediction depends only on two basic assumptions exactly conserved r - parity and neutral lsp  and is independent of the precise values of the model parameters .",
    "thus , quite generally , an inclusive search for events with missing energy in association with jets and/or charged leptons is the best model - independent search strategy .",

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> this is a set of four lectures presented at the theoretical advanced study institute ( tasi-09 ) in june 2009 . </S>",
    "<S> the goal of the lectures is to introduce students to some of the basic ideas and tools required for theoretical analysis of collider data . </S>",
    "<S> several examples of standard model processes at electron - positron and hadron colliders are considered to illustrate these ideas . in addition , a general strategy for formulating searches for physics beyond the standard model is outlined . </S>",
    "<S> the lectures conclude with a brief survey of recent , ongoing and future searches for the higgs boson and supersymmetric particles . </S>"
