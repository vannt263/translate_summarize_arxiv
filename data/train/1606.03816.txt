    "obama was the first us president in history who successfully leveraged online social media in presidential campaigning , which has been popularized and become a ubiquitous approach to electoral politics ( such as in the on - going 2016 us presidential election ) in contrast to the decreasing relevance of traditional media such as tv and newspapers @xcite .",
    "the power of campaigning via social media in modern politics is a consequence of online social networking being an important part of people s regular daily social lives .",
    "it has been quite common that individuals use social network sites to share their ideas and comment on other people s opinions . in recent years",
    ", large organizations , such as governments , public media , and business corporations , also start to announce news , spread ideas , and/or post advertisements in order to steer the public opinion through social media platform .",
    "there has been extensive interest for these entities to influence the public s view and manipulate the trend by incentivizing influential users to endorse their ideas / merits / opinions at certain monetary expenses or credits .",
    "to obtain most cost - effective trend manipulations , one needs to design an optimal campaigning strategy or policy such that quantities of interests , such as influence of opinions , exposure of a campaign , adoption of new products , can be maximized or steered towards the target amount given realistic budget constraints .",
    "the key factor differentiating social networks from traditional media is _",
    "peer influence_. in fact , events in an online social network can be categorized roughly into two types : endogenous events where users just respond to the actions of their neighbors within the network , and exogenous events where users take actions due to drives external to the network .",
    "then it is natural to raise the following fundamental questions regarding optimal campaigning over social networks : can we model and exploit those event data to steer the online community to a desired exposure level ? more specifically , can we drive the overall exposure to a campaign to a certain level ( e.g. , at least twice per week per user ) by incentivizing a small number of users to take more initiatives ?",
    "what about maximizing the overall exposure for a target group of people ?",
    "more importantly , those exposure shaping tasks are more effective when the interventions are implemented in multiple stages . due to the inherent uncertainty in social behavior , the outcome of each intervention may not be fully predictable but can be anticipated to some extent before the next intervention happens .",
    "a key aspect of such situations is that interventions ca nt be viewed in isolation since one must balance the desire for high present reward with the penalty of low future outcome .    in this paper ,",
    "the _ dynamic programming _ framework  @xcite is employed to tackle the aforementioned issues . in particular , we first establish the fundamental theory of optimal campaigning over social networks where the user activities are modeled as a multivariate hawkes process ( mhp )  @xcite since mhp can capture both endogenous and exogenous event intensities .",
    "we also derive a time dependent linear relation between the intensity of exogenous events and the overall exposure to the campaign . exploiting this connection ,",
    "we develop a convex dynamic programming framework for determining the optimal intervention policy that prescribes the required level of external drive at each stage in order for the campaign to reach a desired exposure profile .",
    "we propose several objective functions that are commonly considered as campaigning criteria in social networks .",
    "experiments on both synthetic data and real world network of news websites in the memetracker dataset show that our algorithms can shape the exposure of campaigns much more accurately than baselines .",
    "c   + a ) the social network and events +    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "for the synthetic case we can freely evaluate the properties of the proposed algorithm under several conditions . we assess the performance of the algorithm and compare to the baselines in three settings : i ) increasing size of the network ; ii ) increasing number of intervention points ; iii ) increasing the time window ( or equivalently the stage duration ) .",
    "the results are reported while keeping other parameters fixed . to compare it to the others we simulate the network with the prescribed intervention intensity and",
    "compute the objective function .",
    "the mean and standard deviation of the objective function out of 10 runs are reported .",
    "figures [ fig : synth - cem - results ] , [ fig : synth - mmesh - results ] , and [ fig : synth - lsesh - results ] shows the results for cem , mem , and les respectively . in each figure ,",
    "the first row is for varying number of nodes , the second row is for varying number of intervention points , and the third row is for varying duration of stages .",
    "the proposed method is consistently better than the baselines .",
    "the trends and facts reported in the main paper are observed in this extended experiment .",
    "additionally , we want to refer the high variance of baseline methods especially rnd and opl which is what we expect ."
