    "turbulence theory in kinetic phase space is more than a simple extension of navier - stokes turbulence into higher dimensions as velocity space is not exactly equivalent to position space : for instance , there is no translational symmetry ( i.e.  small velocities are not equivalent to large velocities ) , and there is always some large - scale velocity dependence imposed by the background distribution function ( e.g.  on the scale of the thermal velocity for a maxwellian background ) ; see also ref .  @xcite , sec .",

    "one of them is the free energy or entropy which is also an invariant in three dimensions ( 3d ) , and another , approximately related to kinetic energy in the long wave - length limit , is particular to two dimensions ( 2d ) . in this",
    "regard , 2d gyrokinetic turbulence is analogous to 2d fluid turbulence , and indeed , reduces to it in a particular long wave - length limit @xcite .",
    "these two invariants can not share the same local - interaction space in a kolmogorov - like phenomenology , which leads to a dual cascade ( forward and inverse cascades ) @xcite .",
    "as the nonlinear term of 2d gyrokinetics is identical in form to that of 3d gyrokinetics , the understanding of the nonlinear interaction in purely 2d system will serve as a foundation for understanding general 3d magnetized plasmas @xcite .",
