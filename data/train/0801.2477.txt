    "recently , g. dolinar ( @xcite ) treated a more general problem of stability concerning a kind of operators which `` almost '' preserves the disjointness of cozero sets ( see definition  [ djp ] ) .",

    "also @xmath10 stands for the banach space of all @xmath9-valued continuous functions defined on @xmath7 , equipped with its usual supremum norm .",
    "an operator @xmath11 is said to be a _ weighted composition map _ if there exist @xmath12 and a map @xmath13 , continuous on @xmath14 , such that @xmath15 for every @xmath16 and @xmath17 .    obviously every weighted composition map is linear and continuous .",
    "we also include the case that @xmath18 as a weighted composition map ( being @xmath19 ) .",
    "recall that a linear operator @xmath20 is said to be _ disjointness preserving _ ( or _ separating _ ) if , given @xmath4 , @xmath6 yields @xmath21 .",
    "clearly every weighted composition map is disjointness preserving .",
    "reciprocally , it is well known that if a disjointness preserving operator is _ continuous _ , then it is a weighted composition . on the other hand , automatic continuity of disjointness preserving operators",
    "can be obtained sometimes ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) ) .",

    "@xmath2-disjointness preserving _ if @xmath22 , whenever @xmath4 satisfy @xmath23 and @xmath6 ( or , equivalently , if @xmath24 whenever @xmath6 ) .    obviously the study of @xmath2-disjointness preserving operators can be restricted to those of norm @xmath25 , because if @xmath26 is @xmath2-disjointness preserving , then @xmath27 is @xmath28-disjointness preserving . on the other hand , every such @xmath29 has the trivial weighted composition map @xmath18 at distance @xmath25 .",
    "that is , giving any bound equal to or bigger than @xmath25 does not provide any information on the problem .",
    "apart from this , it can be easily checked that every continuous linear functional on @xmath10 of norm @xmath25 is @xmath30-disjointness preserving and , consequently , every continuous linear map @xmath20 with @xmath31 is @xmath30-disjointness preserving .",
    "thus , if we consider again the trivial weighted composition map @xmath32 , then @xmath33 . we conclude that our study can be restricted to @xmath2 belonging to the interval @xmath34 .    in @xcite the author ,",
    "following the above stability questions , studies when an @xmath2-disjointness preserving operator is close to a weighted composition map .",
    "the main result in @xcite reads as follows : let @xmath35 and let @xmath20 be an @xmath2-disjointness preserving operator with @xmath31 .",
    "then there exists a weighted composition map @xmath36 such that @xmath37    in view of the above comments we conclude that dolinar s result is meaningful only for @xmath38 .    apart from the general case , dolinar also concentrates on the study of linear and continuous functionals , where the bound given is @xmath39 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) ) .    on the other hand , notice that when @xmath7 has just one point , we are in a situation of `` extreme stability '' , because every continuous linear operator is a weighted composition map .",

    "it is indeed the smallest in every case , as we give an example such that , for every @xmath42 , no number strictly less than @xmath43 satisfies it ( example [ gustavo ] ) .",
    "the question appears to be very related to the following : find the biggest set @xmath44 such that every @xmath45 has the following property : _ given an @xmath2-disjointness preserving operator @xmath46 with @xmath47 , there exists a weighted composition map @xmath48 such that @xmath49 .",

    "the bound , which can be given for every @xmath51 and every @xmath8 , is the number @xmath52 , and is sharp ( theorem  [ opodel ] and example  [ llegomalenayamigos2 ] ) .    how far",
    "of course , an answer valid for every case would be trivial , because if we take @xmath7 with just one point , then every continuous linear operator is a weighted composition map , so the best bound is just @xmath53 . if we avoid this trivial case and require @xmath7 to have at least two points , then we can see that again the problem turns out to be trivial since the best bound is now attained for sets with two points .",
    "the same happens if we require the set @xmath7 to have at least @xmath54 points .",
    "in general , it can be seen that the answer does not depend on the topological features of the spaces but on their cardinalities .",
    "if we assume that @xmath8 has at least two points , then the number @xmath55 is a valid bound if @xmath7 is infinite ( theorem  [ ex3 ] ) , and a different value plays the same rle for each finite set @xmath7 ( theorem  [ recero ] ) .",
    "we also prove that these estimates are sharp in every case ( theorems  [ vr ] and [ cero ] ) . but here , instead of providing a concrete counterexample , we can show that the bounds are best for a general family of spaces @xmath8 , namely , whenever @xmath8 consists of the stone - ech compactification of any discrete space .",

    "in fact some results given in this case will be tools for a more general study .",
