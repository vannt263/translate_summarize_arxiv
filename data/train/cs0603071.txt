    "the proof applies lemmas  [ lemmaaffin ] and [ lemmadicht ] which are in some sense linear counterparts to proposition  [ lemone]b ) and lemma  [ lemthree ] , respectively .",

    "in particular , the reduced denominator @xmath233 of @xmath21 is also that of @xmath134 .",
    "[ lemmadicht ] for each @xmath337 , the set  @xmath338   is dense in @xmath9 .",

    "@xmath4 branches @xmath21 along the very same path as @xmath355 and eventually ends up in a leaf , contradicting that @xmath4 terminates only for @xmath84 .    in the linear setting , does @xmath10 have the same degree of undecidability as the halting problem ?",
    "we have shown that oracle access to the set of rational numbers @xmath10 gives a bss machine additional power but still prevents it from solving the real halting problem @xmath11 ( of bss machines ) .",
    "in addition we have explicitly specified an uncountable number of incomparable recursively enumerable degrees in the real number setting .",
    "this involved arguments from topology as well as from abstract algebra ; e.g. , transcendence , irreducible polynomials , and finite field extensions play a major role . in the linear setting",
    ", a similar result was obtained using number theory ; e.g. , irrationality , primes , and integral lattices .",
    "our proofs generally do not rely on the ordering available over the real numbers .",
    "thus with small corrections ( for example a slightly changed definition of the characteristic path in a potential decision tree ) it also works over the complex numbers yielding the corresponding results .",
    "we close with some remarks concerning hypercomputation .",
    "since there is no commonly accepted definition of what hypercomputation should be our remarks , however , are a bit speculative . regarding attempts to physically realize hypercomputation over the reals our results indicate that it seems advisable ( since provably easier ) to construct a device capable of solving @xmath10 rather than @xmath11 .",
    "such an approach may , in contrast to discrete hypercomputation , benefit from the explicit knowledge of this degree .",
    "one might object that , since  ` _ _ natura non facit saltus _ _ '   according to leibniz , the discontinuity inherent in deciding @xmath10 in @xmath9 ( i.e. , of distinguishing fractions from general reals ) makes an according devise physically impossible .",
    "however we point out that for example the fractional quantum hall effect ( nobel prize physics 1998 ) shows that nature does exhibit exactly this kind of discontinuous behaviour .",
