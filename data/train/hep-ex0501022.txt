    "i am going to talk about new results from cleo and bes , two detectors half a world apart , trying to catch the same particles .",
    "cleo used to do physics in the b - quark region ( @xmath0 gev ) .",
    "it has many credits in bottomonium ( @xmath1 ) spectroscopy , and @xmath2 ) physics .",
    "the cesr accelerator and the cleo detector have now been modified to do physics in the c - quark region ( @xmath3 gev ) ; this means cleo - c for charmonium ( @xmath4 ) spectroscopy , and @xmath5 ) physics .",
    "i will mainly talk about results in charmonium spectroscopy from cleo and cleo - c , but i will also present some spectroscopic results for bottomonium .",
    "bes has worked primarily in charmonium spectroscopy since the beginning of the bepc project .",
    "bes was recently improved to bes ii , and has logged a formidable number of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the new results come from these datasets .",
    "to put the physics of the @xmath8 quarkonium systems in perspective , i illustrate the charmonium and bottomonium spectra in fig .",
    "i want to note that in the case of charmonium before now the big gaps were in the identification of the singlet states @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and in states above the @xmath11 threshold .",
    "this is where remarkable progress has been made , and i will talk about it . in the case of bottomonium",
    "there has been progress in precision , and also in identification of a new state and a new transition .",
    "bes has reported some provocative results about baryon - antibaryon systems and light quark mesons as well .",
    "the existing databases are illustrated in fig .",
    "2 . in the charmonium region bes dominates with 58 million @xmath12 and @xmath13 million @xmath14 , but already cleo - c has more @xmath15 . in the bottomonium region , cleo has greatly improved on its own earlier data , with , for example @xmath16 million @xmath17 .",
    "the search of @xmath9 , the hyperfine partner of @xmath18 , has a long history .",
    "its identification was claimed at a mass @xmath19 mev by the crystal ball in 1982 @xcite , but it was not confirmed by any other experiments , including fermilab @xmath20 experiments e760/e835 @xcite .",
    "recently , belle [ 3,4 ] reported @xmath21 observation in two different measurements , with the results :    [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]      cleo @xcite has made new measurements of the radiative transitions @xmath24 and @xmath25 . the masses of both sets of @xmath26 states are found to be in excellent agreement with earlier results , as summarized by pdg @xcite .",
    "the branching ratios @xmath27 are similarly in excellent agreement with those in the literature , but @xmath28 are all found to be smaller than those in pdg @xcite , by factors @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "until now the only bottomonium states which had been firmly identified were the @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xmath35 . in a tour - de - force measurement of a four photon cascade ,",
    "cleo @xcite has identified the @xmath36 state of bottomonium , with @xmath37 mev .",
    "the cascade was , @xmath38 .      until now the only hadronic transitions ever observed between bottomonium states were the two pion transitions @xmath40 .",
    "recently , a first was achieved by the cleo @xcite identification of weak transitions @xmath41 , with @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "with cesr - iii and cleo - iii transmuting into cesr - c and cleo - c , we do not expect any new data to be taken for bottomonium spectroscopy , and there is little prospect of belle or babar running at any",
    ". however , we can expect cleo to mine all it can from the existing body of their bottomonium data .",
    "the prospects for spectroscopy in the charm / charmonium region are much brighter .",
    "cleo - c is dedicated to producing vast quantities of @xmath45 physics and charmonium physics during the next three years or so .",
    "the bepc - ii ( bes iii ) and gsi ( panda ) should then come online , and we should see many years of dedicated spectroscopy of the charm / charmonium region .",
    "keep tuned .",
    "this research was supported in part by the us department of energy ."
