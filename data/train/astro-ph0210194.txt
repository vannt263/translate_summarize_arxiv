    "the quasar 3c  279 ( z=0.536 ) is one of the best studied active galaxies in the sky .",
    "it is a bright egret @xmath2-ray source @xcite , and shows rapid variability across the entire electromagnetic spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one of the first early triumphs of the technique of very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) , was the discovery of apparent superluminal motion in the parsec - scale jet of this quasar ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "subsequent superluminal ejections have been continually monitored for more than thirty years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the vlbi jet s polarization structure @xcite has been imaged at frequencies as high as 86 ghz @xcite .",
    "circular polarization has been detected in the parsec - scale jet , possibly implying an electron - positron composition @xcite .",
    "the radio jet has long been known to extend out to kiloparsec scales for @xmath05@xmath1 to the south - southwest @xcite .",
    "an extended feature to the northwest can be attributed to a radio lobe fueled by the doppler dimmed counter - jet , but is equally likely to be due to the main jet because of its extreme viewing angle to our line of sight ( figure  [ fig-1 ] ; * ? ? ?",
    "the recent discovery of an x - ray counterpart to the 5@xmath1 long radio jet in a deep _ chandra _ exposure prompted an analysis of archival _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) images in search of optical emission in the jet .",
    "the _ chandra _ results will be presented elsewhere @xcite . in this _ letter _ , we report the detection of optical and ultraviolet ( uv ) emission associated with the brightest region in the kiloparsec scale radio jet .",
    "we adopt a friedmann cosmology with @xmath3 = 75 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 and @xmath5 = 0 throughout this _ letter _",
    ", so at the distance of the quasar , 1 arcsecond equals 5.58 kpc .",
    "we obtained post - costar faint object camera ( foc ) f/96 @xcite images of 3c  279 from the _ hst _ archive with ` on - the - fly ' pipeline calibration applied .",
    "single high quality exposures with the f253 m and f550 m filters ( each @xmath01  ksec ) were taken consecutively during november 1995 as part of a program ( i d 6057 ) to study the inner structure of the quasar @xcite with the fine guidance sensors ( fgs )  see table  1 .",
    "these filters approximate the standard u and v bands , respectively . to our knowledge ,",
    "only the fgs data have been published ( e. schreier , personal communication ) .",
    "a visual inspection of the foc images shows a noticeable linear extension centered @xmath00.6@xmath1 from the quasar nucleus , at a position angle ( in the sky ) of @xmath6 in both the u and v band exposures .",
    "this feature matches the position of the bright knot ` d ' in the radio jet ( nomenclature of * ? ? ?",
    "an overlay of the optical image with a high resolution radio image ( figure  [ fig-1 ] ) show that the optical feature is clearly coincident with this region of the radio jet .",
    "we were able to confirm this detection in two short ( 300 sec ) r - band wfpc2 f702w exposures taken more than a year apart as part of the _ hst _ 3cr snapshot survey @xcite .",
    "both images unfortunately suffered from saturated nuclei , and even worse , a diffraction spike lies at the position angle of the radio jet for almost its entire 5@xmath1 extent",
    ". however , subtracting a smoothed version of the psf from both the individual exposures , and from the combined image , revealed a large excess above the diffraction spike at the position of knot d in each case ( figure  [ fig-2 ] ) .",
    "its count rate ( measured from the unsharp masked image ) is about three times greater than that measured anywhere else on that or the other three diffraction spikes .",
    "we use these data only for confirming the optical identification of knot d , as any flux measurement from these images will be hopelessly contaminated .",
    "two more _ hst _ images were available in the archive at the time of our analysis from the same foc / fgs program described above @xcite .",
    "the observing sequence from the original program was repeated @xmath01.5 years later ( on 30 may 1997 ) , but utilized the f2nd neutral density filters in parallel which resulted in a factor of about six drop in sensitivity .",
    "our extraction procedure was performed on the images from the later epoch and showed flux levels at the predicted position of the 0.6@xmath1 knot to be consistent with the background ( see  [ s : results ] ) .",
    "fluxes for the quasar nucleus could still be extracted from these images yielding 1.1 and 3.5 mjy at u and v bands , which are consistent with contemporaneous ground - based measurements @xcite .",
    "we similarly extracted nuclear fluxes for the 1995 epoch and obtained 0.79 mjy ( u ) and 2.8 mjy ( v ) , again , close to ground - based results by @xcite .",
    "radio data was obtained from the nrao very large array @xcite archive and the merlin archive ( see table  1 for a summary ) . the vla data ( 5 and 15 ghz )",
    "was calibrated in aips @xcite utilizing standard procedures and self - calibrated in the caltech difmap package @xcite .",
    "we selected the data carefully to give us matched resolution images ( @xmath00.4@xmath1 ) at the two frequencies .",
    "fluxes were set using the vla 1999.2 coefficients for 3c  286 .",
    "the merlin data ( 5 ghz ) was pipeline processed at jodrell bank on the @xcite scale , and then combined at brandeis with a day - long vla observation recently obtained when the full array was used as a single element for a vsop space - vlbi experiment .",
    "we accounted for variability in the source between the two epochs of observation by subtracting 9.75 jy from the vla nucleus in the @xmath7 plane . with baselines up to 217 km , this data produced our highest resolution radio image ( figures  [ fig-1 ] &  [ fig-2 ] ) , which most closely matches that achieved by the _ hst _ data ( @xmath00.05 - 0.1@xmath1 ) .",
    "@xcite presented an earlier image of 3c  279 using merlin only data . to our knowledge ,",
    "only the wfpc2 data @xcite , but none of the other multi - wavelength observations presented in this work were previously published .",
    "the jet emission in the two 1995 foc exposures appear prominently above the background and wings of the point spread function ( psf ) . nevertheless , in order to verify that the extended emission detected was not an artifact of the psf wings due to the bright nucleus , we subtracted scaled psfs from each 3c  279 image using images of stars from foc calibration program i d 6196 ( the foc is insensitive to cosmic rays and a careful inspection of the images did not show any unusual defects near the knot position ) .",
    "the emission from radio knot d clearly remained in the resultant images ( not shown ) .",
    "we did not detect any optical counterpart to the rest of the arcsecond - scale jet3@xmath1 where the field of view of the foc images was cut off , and for its entire length in the wfpc2 images .",
    "] , where the radio emission is weaker and the radio - to - optical spectrum ( based on previous ground based optical imaging ) is expected to be steeper : @xmath8 @xcite , using the sign convention @xmath9 .",
    "analysis of the radio data and optical limits for the rest of the jet is deferred to a future paper @xcite .",
    "we extracted counts from the original ( unrotated ) geometrically corrected and flat - fielded images using square apertures with 21 pixel ( @xmath00.3@xmath1 ) sides , centered on the position of the knot ( we chose not to extract fluxes from the psf subtracted images since additional artifacts were introduced from this process ) .",
    "this aperture was judged by eye to contain all the flux from the jet knot , and is situated far enough away from the bright quasar to avoid large contaminations .",
    "the background and contribution from the psf was determined using the same aperture to measure the average count - rates at the three 0.6@xmath1 distant azimuthal positions in @xmath10 intervals around the core .",
    "the count rates were converted to flux densities using the inverse sensitivity measurement given by the ` photflam ` keyword in the image headers , yielding 6.1 and 1.8 @xmath11jy at the v and u bands , respectively .",
    "we experimented with various circular apertures and found measurement differences on the order of @xmath020 - 25@xmath12 ( higher for the uv data ) with that derived above .",
    "therefore , we conservatively estimate this to be the error in our _ hst _ flux measurements .",
    "these fluxes are consistent with ( 1@xmath13 ) upper limits of about 10 @xmath11jy ( v ) and 6 @xmath11jy ( u ) measured from the poisson noise in the second epoch foc data .",
    "we used difmap s ` modelfit ` program to fit elliptical gaussian models to the radio visibility data in the inner region of the jet . the position and size ( including ellipticity ) derived in this manner for knot",
    "d was consistent between the frequencies and gave fluxes of 279 mjy ( 4.76 ghz ) and 115 mjy ( 15 ghz ) which we estimate are accurate to better than 10 and 15@xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the size of the emitting region is best constrained by the merlin+vla image which gives a measured gaussian with dimensions @xmath14 , elongated in the jet direction .",
    "we estimated a 1.67 ghz flux ( 650 mjy @xmath15 ) from a published merlin map @xcite of comparable resolution to our new 5 and 15 ghz radio data , giving us a three point _ radio _",
    "spectral index ( @xmath16=0.79 ) for region d which agrees with the value of 0.75@xmath170.1 measured by @xcite .",
    "the optical and uv fluxes lie below the power - law extrapolation from the radio measurements , indicating steepening at higher frequencies where we measure an optical / uv spectral index of 1.6 with a 2-@xmath13 confidence of 0.3 .",
    "the radio - to - uv spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig-3 ] .",
    "the radio emission from region d shows a high level of fractional polarization ( 20@xmath12 ) at 5 ghz , but does not appear to be strongly shocked as the magnetic field direction is predominantly longitudinal @xcite indicating a shear dominated flow . its integrated radio - to - uv spectrum can be well explained by a steepening synchrotron spectrum from a single population of relativistic electrons , as is the usual interpretation for the growing number of already detected optical / uv arcsecond - scale jets @xcite .",
    "we can extrapolate the radio spectrum to the optical / uv by fitting a break at @xmath18 hz to a smoothly connected double power - law spectrum ( figure  [ fig-3 ] ) , so the synchrotron luminosity appears to peak in the near - infrared .",
    "if we can extend the observed spectrum to even higher energies , it would predict a 1 kev flux of roughly 0.4  njy if the x - ray output from the 0.6@xmath1 feature is dominated by synchrotron losses .",
    "this should be easily detectable in the _ chandra _ exposure obtained by @xcite , although it may be difficult to resolve with the detector s limited resolution of @xmath19/pixel .",
    "the measured steepening in the spectral index ( @xmath20 ) corresponds to a change in the electron distribution index @xmath21@xmath22 ( see below ) of 1.6 .",
    "similar changes have been found for other well - studied high - energy ( optical and x - ray ) synchrotron emitting regions in the jets of , for instance , m87 @xcite and pks  0521365 @xcite .",
    "we applied a homogeneous synchrotron model ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to calculate an equipartition magnetic field , @xmath23~g$ ] .",
    "the factor @xmath24 is defined by the relation : @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the energy densities in the magnetic field and electrons , respectively ( e.g. , if we have equipartition , @xmath28 for an electron - positron plasma ) .",
    "we assumed that the electrons have a power law energy distribution @xmath29 ( with minimum and maximum energy cutoffs , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 ) , and that the radiating particles and magnetic field fill a fraction , @xmath32 , of a spherical volume whose diameter is @xmath33 cm ( applying an appropriate conversion from our measured elliptical gaussian fit to the size ; @xcite ) .",
    "the doppler beaming factor is defined as @xmath34^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath35 is the bulk lorentz factor of the knot , @xmath36 is the velocity of the jet in units of c , and @xmath37 is the angle the jet makes to our line of sight .",
    "this calculation is only weakly dependent on @xmath38 which we arbitrarily set to extend into infinity . in the extreme case",
    "that the errors in the radio fluxes were even larger than our conservative estimates , it may be possible to obtain a single power law index ( @xmath391 ) fit to the overall radio - to - uv spectrum .",
    "our calculation of @xmath40 in this case maintains relatively unaffected by this steeper spectral index .",
    "the derived magnetic field implies that the uv emitting electrons have @xmath41 $ ] with a radiative lifetime ( in their rest frame ) of about @xmath42 yrs .",
    "it is useful to see how the synchrotron cooling time of the uv emitting electrons in knot d compares with the light travel distance from the nucleus .",
    "firstly , the angle between the jet and our line of sight is restricted to be @xmath43 by the observed vlbi apparent superluminal motion of 14c @xcite .",
    "we note that this measurement is the fastest ( and earliest ) motion recorded in this quasar so far , and was observed when the vlbi jet was best aligned ( @xmath44 ) with the position angle of the vla scale jet ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "this gives us a deprojected distance from the nucleus to knot d of @xmath4525 kpc .",
    "now , if the doppler factor this far down the jet is as large as that observed on parsec - scales ( @xmath46 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and making the simple assumptions , @xmath28 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , we can infer a rest - frame @xmath49 g  comparable to those derived for other known optical emitting synchrotron features ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it follows that the _ observed _ ( accounting for time dilation between the rest frame and observer frame ) radiative lifetime is @xmath50 yrs which corresponds to a travel distance of @xmath090 kpc and exceeds the light travel time from the nucleus by a factor of a few .",
    "this makes it just plausible that _ in - situ _ reacceleration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is not strictly required if the doppler factor at the site of knot d is really as high as that measured on parsec scales , but that remains unknown .",
