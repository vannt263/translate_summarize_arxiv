    "the classical nucleation theory ( cnt ) has been extensively tested in systems with relatively simple two - body interactions such as colloids or globular proteins  @xcite .",
    "these molecules are large and move slowly , making it possible to follow the crystallization process experimentally using various techniques of microscopy .",
    "moreover , these systems can also be represented accurately by theoretical models of hard- and soft - spheres , which can crystallize on numerical time scales .",
    "it is therefore possible to characterize fully the microscopic mechanisms responsible for nucleation in terms of the cnt , which works particular well for these systems .",
    "there has also been a number of studies going beyond the soft - sphere models . in particular , there has been considerable work devoted to the nucleation of lennard - jones models  @xcite .",
    "very little work has been done , however , on more complex materials such as oriented liquids  water or tetrahedral semiconductors , for example .",
    "recently , matsumoto _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , using considerable computing power , managed to follow one occurrence of crystallization in a 300 ns run of a 512-molecule simulation of water in the canonical ensemble at 230 k. clearly more simulations are needed in water but also in simpler oriented liquids such as silicon , which shows a similar phases diagram around melting as both liquids show a temperature of density maximum and their density falls off by @xmath1 10% from the disordered liquid to the tetrahedral crystalline structure . as with water",
    ", there has been very few works studying nucleation in this technologically important material  @xcite .",
    "depending on the cooling rate , previous numerical work has shown that supercooled liquid silicon transforms in a glassy  @xcite or amorphous  @xcite state .",
    "recently , it was indicated that this transition takes place just below a liquid - liquid transition  @xcite : at zero pressure in the stillinger - weber silicon , the low density liquid ( ldl ) , which is thermodynamically and structurally contiguous to the amorphous solid , crystallizes rapidly ( around 10 ns ) at 1050 k  @xcite whereas the more common high - density liquid ( hdl ) does not at any temperature on a simulation timescale . in order to circumvent the difficulty to crystallize _",
    "l_-si , uttormark and colleagues  @xcite embedded a spherical crystal seed containing 400 - 800 atoms in bulk liquid and analyzed the growth and dissolution of clusters .",
    "they found that the critical size for a crystallite to grow to macroscopic size was of 140 and 1400 atoms at 60% and 85% of the melting temperature ( t@xmath2 ) . working with a similar method ,",
    "bording and taft  @xcite inserted a crystallite in an amorphous matrix of 4096 germanium atoms and estimated the critical cluster radius to be 2 nm ( around 1500 atoms ) at 60% t@xmath2 .    in this paper , we show that liquid silicon can crystallize in the nvt ensemble on timescale accessible by md simulation without going through the low - density liquid phase .",
    "we also show that the nucleation process , while qualitatively consistent with cnt , differs quantitatively from it .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follow .",
    "we show the behavior of the thermodynamic , kinetic and structural properties during the phase transition in section  [ phase ] . in section  [ stability ] , we analyze the nucleation and crystallization process through the evolution of the cluster that will eventually crystallize the whole system in relation to cnt .",
    "then , in section  [ free_e ] , we compute and compare the free energy of clusters between cnt and the simulation data . finally , we look at the lifetime of small clusters in the supercooled liquid before nucleation takes place in section  [ life ] .",
    "the molecular dynamical simulations ( md ) for this work are performed in the canonical ( nvt ) ensemble at the 0 k crystalline density , i.e. 2.32 g/@xmath3 , and in the isothermal - isobaric ( npt ) ensemble at 0 pressure .",
    "all simulations are done at 1250 k ( 75% t@xmath2 ) in a cubic box containing 10648 atoms , with periodic - boundary conditions .",
    "this size is sufficiently large to avoid catastrophic crystal growth due to interactions between the images of the critical crystallite , which is estimated to be around 200 atoms ( see below ) .",
    "we use the extended - system method of andersen to control pressure  @xcite and hoover s constraint method for the temperature  @xcite .",
    "newton s equations of motion are integrated with a fifth - order gear predictor - corrector and a time step @xmath4 fs .",
    "simulations are typically equilibrated over 50 000 @xmath5 ( 58 ps ) and data are accumulated over @xmath6 ( several ns ) .",
    "atomic interactions are represented by the stillinger - weber potential ( sw ) , developed to reproduce accurately the crystalline and liquid state of si  @xcite .    starting with a liquid",
    "well equilibrated at 2900 k , we generate nine independent trajectories in nvt conditions at 2.32 g/@xmath3 and 75% of t@xmath2 , a degree of undercooling similar to that used for a wide variety of materials both experimentally  @xcite and numerically .",
    "@xcite of these nine trajectories , six crystallize within 10 ns and are numbered 1 to 6 ; the fastest , simulation # 1 , crystallizes within 1.5 ns .    following previous work on liquid si  @xcite",
    ", we use as order parameter the smallest three - dimensional closed - ring structures that can be associated with a given crystalline lattice .",
    "these clusters , shown in fig .",
    "[ basic_b ] , are the smallest elementary building blocks for wurtzite , diamond and @xmath7-tin structures and are defined topologically : the wurtzite lattice is associated with a 12-atom cluster composed of two sixfold rings connected at three points while the diamond and diamond can be described topologically by a single 10-atom cluster with four sixfold rings back to back . to establish the connectivity of these clusters , the first - neighbor cut - off is set to 2.75  , a value similar to that used in these high - quality amorphous networks .",
    "this is somewhat shorter than the typically nearest - neighbor distance used in liquids ( which is about 3.0  ) as it focuses on local crystalline order .",
    "these elementary clusters are present with a low density in the liquid ( @xmath8 % at . ) as well as in high - quality amorphous models prepared using the modified www bond - switching algorithm ( @xmath9 % at . )",
    "these blocks provide therefore a much more sensitive measure of crystallinity than the structure factor or the rdf .",
    "our criteria are different from those used in a previous study of the nucleation of crystallites implanted into a sw liquid by uttormark , thompson and clancy  @xcite . in this case , the description of a crystallite nucleus is defined uniquely based on a mixture of energetic , topological and geometric constraints . for an atom to be part of a crystallite : ( i ) its three - body energy in sw potential of fourfold or fivefold coordinated atoms ( within a 3.35   nearest - neighbor distance ) must be lower than 0.4336 ev ; ( ii ) it must posses four nearest neighbors and at least three of them are also fourfold coordinated ; ( iii ) its angular bond angles meet this criterion : @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 is the angle between nearest neighbors of a fourfold coordinated atom . ) the crystallites identified with this method are less compact than those flagged with our topological order parameter .",
    "this is particularly true for small crystallites ( less than 20 atoms ) , which tend to be open and stringy , like twisted polymers , with uttormark s criteria .",
    "the two methods converge , however , for larger clusters , near and beyond the critical size , where a clear definition of surface is less important .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ carac2 ]      it is formally straightforward to compare the simulations with the predictions of cnt on the thermodynamics of crystal growth . the free energy curve of crystallites can be obtained from the simulations by plotting the equilibrium probability @xmath12 to find a crystallite of size @xmath13 in the metastable liquid  @xcite .",
    "we compute @xmath14 in the supercooled liquid , accumulating data until the largest cluster reaches 500 atoms , less than 5 % of the total number of atoms but over the critical size ( see tab .",
    "[ carac1 ] ) , and over all runs .",
    "this distribution is directly connected to the free energy @xmath15 associated with these clusters : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the number of clusters of size @xmath13 present in the liquid , @xmath18 is the boltzmann constant times temperature and @xmath19 , a constant .",
    "the cnt offers another way to compute the free energy . in a simple relation , the energy gain in the formation of a new phase",
    "is balanced by the cost to produce an interface between the old and new phases : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the helmholtz free energy difference between solid and liquid states in nvt conditions , @xmath22 with @xmath23 the surface tension , @xmath24 for spherical crystallites and @xmath25 the density of the solid phase . while the helmholtz free energy difference @xmath26 is relatively easy to obtain , the evaluation of the surface tension is much trickier because small crystallites are far from spherical and fluctuate considerably in shape for a given size .",
    "crystallites become mostly spherical only well beyond the over - critical size .",
    "figure  [ free_e01 ] compares the free energy for these two methods : from the equilibrium probability ( eq .  [ f_prob ] ) and from cnt predictions ( eq .  [ tcn_01 ] ) . following standard practice ,",
    "the surface energy parameter @xmath27 is fitted in order to obtain the best agreement with the first method .",
    "the helmholtz free energy difference between the crystalline and liquid phases is computed as follows .",
    "the gibbs free energy difference @xmath28 between solid and liquid states in npt conditions at zero pressure is given by the difference in chemical potential @xmath29 between the two phases .",
    "this quantity was computed by broughton and li  @xcite and was found to be @xmath30 ev / at .",
    "however , we need the helmholtz free energy difference @xmath26 at fixed density , which we can obtained by thermodynamical integration from the zero pressure results . starting with the relation for the internal pressure @xmath31",
    ", we use a thermodynamic integration for each phase ( @xmath32- and @xmath33-si ) : @xmath34    the free energy difference between our system at zero pressure and at fixed density is computed by a gaussian integration with five values : @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the values for the gaussian integration with their relative weight @xmath38 .",
    "the initial volume , at zero pressure , for the liquid is @xmath39  @xmath40 ( 2.467 g/@xmath3 ) and the solid , @xmath41  @xmath40 ( 2.29 g/@xmath3 ) ; the final volume is @xmath42  @xmath40 .",
    "each point in the integral is simulated in nvt conditions at 1250 k for the liquid and solid .",
    "we equilibrate our 1000-atoms system for 58 ps and then compute the mean pressure during 345 ps of simulation time .    after integrating ,",
    "we find a free energy difference per atom between the fixed density ( @xmath43 = 2.32 g/@xmath3 ) and zero pressure system  @xcite , for liquid and solid state : @xmath44 this gives a free energy difference between the liquid and solid phase at 2.32 g/@xmath3 and 1250 k of @xmath45 the constant - volume correction is therefore only 6% of the zero pressure result of broughton and li .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ free_e01 ] , however , the cnt curve does not match the free energy data coming from @xmath12 in simulations . in order to find a better fit , the free energy difference @xmath26 between the solid and liquid state should be nine times lower than the value computed with the thermodynamic integration .",
    "we can verify the impact due to the choice of the order parameter on the free energy curve by re - analyzing the data using the criteria of uttormark _",
    "et al . _",
    "the resulting curve is also plotted in fig .  [ free_e01 ] and shows an even flatter curve , away from cnt results .",
    "we also repeated the simulation at 1250 k in the npt ensemble at zero pressure and over 10 ns .",
    "in this situation , the trajectories do not crystallize  the largest crystallite reaches about 100 atoms , well below the estimated critical size .",
    "the free energy distribution obtained from the cluster size distribution , while more curved than that for the nvt conditions , is still far from the cnt predictions ( @xmath28 is about 5 times too low ) .",
    "the discrepancy between the two approaches clearly indicates that the classical nucleation theory does not fully capture the nucleation process in sw si .",
    "we identify two possible sources of discrepancy .",
    "( 1 ) as was demonstrated by sastry and angell recently  @xcite , sw si undergoes a high - density to low - density liquid - liquid phase transition .",
    "the low density phase could be stabilized at higher temperature by the presence of a crystallite . in this case",
    ", it would be necessary to take into account two interfaces instead of one in the cnt equations .",
    "( 2 ) the cnt fails because the critical nucleus is too small breaking the approximation of spherical crystallites . at this moment , we could not verify or disprove either of these possibilities .      beyond the free energy curve",
    ", we also analyze the dynamics of the crystallites present in the supercooled liquid .",
    "the lifetime probability of crystallites can be derived by following the kinetic approach of zeldovich  @xcite .",
    "this approach predicts that the evolution of the clusters can be described by a diffusion equation of the form : @xmath46   \\bigg\\rbrace \\label{zeldo2}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the concentration of crystallites of size @xmath13 at time @xmath48 , @xmath49 the diffusion and @xmath50 the boltzmann factor times the temperature .",
    "van kampen  @xcite resolved the differential equation for small times by assuming the diffusion to be constant . further approximating the potential as linear with respect to the cluster s size ,",
    "van beijeren  @xcite succeeded in finding a solution for longer times .",
    "this latter equation , which gives the distribution function for first arrival at size @xmath51 , for crystallites starting from size @xmath52 is a well - known results  @xcite that confirms van kampen short term behavior and contains an additional friction term @xmath53 which becomes important for longer times :    @xmath54    where @xmath55    this probability distribution is formally known as an inverse gaussian distribution ( or inverse normal , wald ) .",
    "it was first derived independently by schrdinger  @xcite and smoluchowski  @xcite to describe brownian motion in systems with a drift velocity .",
    "hence , the development of a crystallite can be represented as a random walk in a field of force @xmath56 through different size classes where small clusters have a strong tendency to dissolve into the liquid ( a drift to @xmath57 ) and super - critical nano - crystals tend to growth to macroscopic size ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "since we do not have all the information on the free energy of crystallites @xmath59 ( see section  [ free_e ] ) and the diffusion constant , it is not possible to use directly eq .",
    "[ beij ] to compare the lifetime behavior of clusters in the supercooled liquid during nucleation .",
    "however , we can circumvent the difficulty by writing the inverse gaussian distribution under a parametric form where @xmath60 represents the mean and @xmath61 , the variance :    @xmath62    @xmath63    we compute the mean lifetime and variance for crystallites reaching the same maximum size in order to determine the theoretical distribution and compare with the lifetime probabilities from numerical simulations .",
    "because large clusters are not encountered frequently , the amount of data collected over all md simulations remains small for the lilfetime of cluster near the critical size .",
    "[ tv01 ] , the lifetime distributions determined by the eq .",
    "[ igd ] and the simulations data are in good agreement for small crystallites ensuring that cluster nucleation is well described by the inverse gaussian distribution .",
    "the mean lifetimes for crystallites reaching an under - critical size of 10 or 30 atoms is 1.32@xmath64 0.6 and 3.79 @xmath65 0.6 ps respectively , with a variance of 1.73 and 10.01 , although some rare clusters last until 30 and 50 ps ( not shown ) .",
    "as would be expected , the mean lifetime increase with the size .    although some approximations have been made to obtain the lifetime probabilities of clusters by the inverse gaussian distribution and from the simulations data , the results are conclusive for crystallites reaching relatively small size . since small clusters developed themselves in a confined range of size , we believe that the free energy difference can be approximated by a linear relation to the crystallite size and the diffusion kept constant .",
    "there has been a lot of interest recently regarding the nature of the liquid - solid transition in oriented liquid such as water and tetrahedral semiconductors . in many systems",
    ", it appears that there exists a high - density to low - density liquid transition often leading to a glassy or amorphous phase  @xcite . here , we reported results on a study of nucleation in liquid si above the hdl to ldl transition .",
    "we find that homogeneous nucleation takes place on a time scale of about 10 ns in a large enough system at constant volume . using a topological order parameter , it is possible to follow the evolution of the crystallites through the crystallization process . based on this analysis , we estimate the critical size to be around 175 atoms , within the limits of previous estimation of uttormark _",
    "et al._. surprisingly , the critical cluster , the one that will eventually crystallize the whole system , can survive at under - critical size for a long time ( up to 900 ps or more ) before it starts to grow steadily . although the cluster s center of mass does not move significantly , there is a fluctuation in the composition of the cluster , as atoms move from the liquid to the crystallite and vice - versa , even once the crystallite has reached an over - critical size .",
    "a comparison of the simulation results with the classical nucleation theory indicates that the general behavior of the nucleation process is in agreement with cnt .",
    "for example , we find that the lifetime distribution of clusters reaching a specific maximum size follows the inverse gaussian distribution predicted recently  @xcite , supporting the description of the cluster growth as a random walk in the presence of a force field associated with the free energy .",
    "however , the details of the nucleation free energy differ significantly from the theoretical predictions . while the specific origin of this discrepancy remains open",
    ", we suggest that it could be caused by the presence of a low - density liquid at the interface between the crystal and the normal liquid or by the small size of the critical nucleus .",
