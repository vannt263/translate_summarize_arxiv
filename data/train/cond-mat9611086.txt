    "the properties of the electron refrigerator@xcite are considered in this paper . in conjunction with the set  thermometer@xcite it forms a new device@xcite for refrigerating and monitoring electrons at sub  kelvin temperature . a future on  chip instrument",
    "can be used to provide isothermal electrons to other experiments , e.g.  in single electronics .",
    "the operation is similar to a household refrigerator in so far as the electron temperature , which decouples from the that of the phonons , can be chosen beforehand within a certain domain . whereas the set  thermometer , based on `` orthodox",
    "theory'',@xcite is rather transparent , less effort is taken in case of the refrigerator.@xcite    the set - up of the experiment under consideration@xcite is shown schematically in fig .",
    "it consists of a pair of tunnel junctions forming the refrigerator and another pair operating as thermometer .",
    "all junctions are connected to the island in the middle whose electrons are dealt with .",
    "the leads of the refrigerator are superconducting whereas the thermometer leads are made from a normal metal .",
    "the refrigerator double junction is biased by a voltage @xmath0 close to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the superconducting gap of its leads .",
    "this allows only hot electrons ( with an energy larger than the fermi energy ) to leave the island and , vice versa , only cold ones to enter it via the other junction .",
    "it is this dispersion which causes electron refrigeration at sub  kelvin temperature , where the heating by phonons is weak .",
    "on the other hand , the thermometer represents an ultrasmall single  electron double tunnel junction .",
    "the thermal dependence of its coulomb blockade enables the determination of the electron temperature . in general",
    "the thermometer is biased too . since the zero  bias conductance is sufficient@xcite and advantageous in order to determine the temperature ,",
    "the bias is usually small and so is the thermometer current as well as the heating by this current .",
    "the tunneling regime of the refrigerator is considered in this paper , which is in contrast to ref .  .",
    "due to the large junction resistance andreev reflections are suppressed and therefore neglected . following the argument from above , the heating by the thermometer current is also neglected .",
    "furthermore , the refrigerating junctions are thought to be symmetric .",
    "this means that there is an equal voltage drop at each junction and the continuity equation for the electric current is fulfilled . in the experiment,@xcite",
    "however , a slight asymmetry was found , which is neglected henceforth .",
    "additionally , thermalized electrons are supposed , i.e.  a sufficiently high temperature causes a sufficiently short electron  electron scattering time , which in turn causes thermalization of the electrons . as pointed out in ref .",
    "the electron temperature should be above @xmath3 to qualify this assumption .",
    "an opposite point of view,@xcite however , reveals interesting physics as well .",
    "our approach starts from the classical formula for the heat current across a nis junction , namely@xcite @xmath4,\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the density of states on the superconducting side , which is assumed to be the bcs density of states , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 $ ] is the fermi distribution function for the normal and superconducting side , respectively .",
    "@xmath8 is the normal  state junction resistance .",
    "the integral ( [ int ] ) is solved in an analytic approximation in sec .",
    "[ calc ] . later on conclusions of this result are discussed in sec .",
    "it might arise the question , what the advantage of this approximative treatment is if a numerical solution is obtained readily . in our opinion",
    "those formulae yield a better insight into the behavior of the refrigerator and its qualities and therefore they are thoroughly worthwhile .",
    "in term of the bcs density of states @xmath5 eq .

    "furthermore , it is right at @xmath17 . for large @xmath18",
    "the difference to the exact formula is negligible , but for an intermediate energy , @xmath19 it is not .",
    "hence , we expect this approximation to work out at low temperature , i.e.  at @xmath20 here .",
    "this condition is obeyed fairly good in the experiment.@xcite    the main advantage of ( [ approx ] ) , however , is the possibility to reduce the integrals of ( [ int2 ] ) to laplace transformations . in detail",

    "the agreement approves of the introduced approximation ( [ approx ] ) and indicates that its accuracy is in the few  percent range .    in a next step ( [ pv ] ) can be used to determine the optimal value of the bias voltage @xmath0 . from the formal derivative of ( [ pv ] )",

[ vopt ] simplifies again considerably to @xmath37 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we plot both the numerical solution of ( [ vopt ] ) and its approximation ( [ vopt2 ] ) .",
    "up to @xmath38 the approximation works nicely thus covering the relevant temperature range ( see next paragraph ) .",
    "it is difficult to observe this shift in the experimental data,@xcite since it corresponds to maximal @xmath39 only .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the heat current ( [ pv ] ) using the optimal bias voltage @xmath32 of ( [ vopt ] ) is shown in comparison with both experimental data and the simpler approximation ( [ pv2 ] ) .",
    "the maximum of the heat current is found at @xmath40 always . therefore ( [ vopt2 ] ) is a practical approximation under relevant conditions as outlined above . whereas eq .",
    "[ pv2 ] yields a useful rule of thumb , the numerical solution is rather convincing .",
    "both the optimal temperature and the maximal heat current are determined satisfactory for higher temperature .",
    "for lower temperature , however , we observe an increasing deviation . this deviation can not be due to our approximation ( [ approx ] ) , which improves with decreasing temperature . according to ref .   also the thermometer",
    "as such is not responsible for those discrepancies .",
    "we attribute the deviation to rising nonequilibrium effects,@xcite i.e.  a non  fermi like energy distribution of the electrons on the island . in ref .",
    "a value of @xmath3 is given as a lower limit of the equilibrium description .",
    "the exact value , however , depends on the specific sample layout .",
    "it is reasonable to expect an increased limit for the experiment under consideration since the temperature reduction is considerably larger and consequently the nonequilibrium effect becomes more pronounced .",
    "finally , we are going to discuss an estimate of the lower limit of the electron temperature @xmath41 based on ( [ pv ] ) .",
    "it is assumed that the heating of the electrons on the island is only due to phonon coupling@xcite and follows@xcite @xmath42 with the island volume @xmath43 and a material dependent prefactor @xmath44 .",
    "[ elph ] implies the assumption that the electrons in the leads are in thermal equilibrium with the phonons and the phonon temperature is constant throughout the whole device . for the stationary situation at optimal bias , @xmath45 , follows a relation between @xmath41 and @xmath34 in terms of eqs .",
    "[ pv ] ,  [ vopt ] , and  [ elph ] .",
    "simpler is the treatment using ( [ pv2 ] ) and ( [ vopt2 ] ) instead of ( [ pv ] ) and ( [ vopt ] ) , respectively , which results in the expression @xmath46 with @xmath47 . for the maximum temperature reduction , @xmath48 , ( [ tmin2 ] ) yields @xmath49 for the optimal values of @xmath50 . using a further approximation , @xmath51",
    ", we find from ( [ tmin2 ] ) and ( [ tmin3 ] ) @xmath52 the last approximation reveals an interesting uniform relation @xmath53 for the optimal working point of the refrigerator , independent of all device parameters . indeed",
    ", the optimal values of the experiment , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , almost meet this universal ratio .",
    "furthermore , since the figure of the ratio assembles from the general exponents 3/2 and 5 only , it is expected to be right beyond the range of our approximation .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the numerical solution of @xmath56 in terms of eqs .",
    "[ pv ] ,  [ vopt ] , and  [ elph ] is compared with the approximation ( [ tmin2 ] ) and the experimental data .",
    "similarly to the discussion above we attribute the deviations at low temperature to the manifestation of nonequilibrium . otherwise we notice fair agreement of the numerical solution and its approximation as long as the temperature is not to high . in comparison with the experiment",

    "an approximation of the original expression of the heat current across those junctions enables a closed analytic formula for this quantity .",
    "based on this formula several features of the refrigerator are discussed . the optimal bias voltage is determined and the proportionality of the corresponding heat current to @xmath59 is confirmed .",
    "the maximal difference of the electron temperature in the leads , @xmath34 , and the island , @xmath41 , is discussed in stationary regime .",
