    "the accurate measurement of @xmath0 is one of the most challenging theoretical and experimental problems in @xmath1 physics .",
    "its value is crucial for constraining the unitarity triangle and probing the question of whether the ckm framework is adequate for describing flavor physics in the standard model .",
    "the present best experimental values for @xmath0 , from the inclusive decay @xmath4 and the exclusive process @xmath5 , are limited by model - dependence and other theoretical errors .",
    "new approaches to extracting @xmath0 from inclusive and exclusive semileptonic decays have been proposed and are promising , but have not yet proven to be viable experimentally .    in light of this situation ,",
    "new methods for probing @xmath0 are still needed . in a recent paper  @xcite",
    ", we suggested that it would be useful to attempt to measure the inclusive production of `` wrong sign '' charm in @xmath1 decays , that is , to look for evidence for the quark level transition @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , we proposed to study the ratio @xmath7 , noting that the theoretical expression for this quantity is in a number of respects particularly well under control .",
    "( here @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the flavor eigenstates , and we take @xmath10 . )",
    "we went on to compute the leading perturbative and nonperturbative corrections to the parton model result for @xmath11 .",
    "the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite also relied implicitly on the use of parton - hadron duality .",
    "this assumption is common to all extractions of @xmath0 from inclusive @xmath1 decays , and while it is not unreasonable to expect it to hold in this case , there is no rigorous proof that it actually does .",
    "perhaps the near equality of the charged and neutral @xmath1 meson lifetimes provides some empirical evidence that duality is well respected in @xmath1 decays .    in this paper",
    "we will refine the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite in a number of respects .",
    "first , we will include complete radiative corrections to @xmath11 at next - to - leading order , that is , all terms proportional to @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "second , we will include a set of `` enhanced '' two loop terms , often referred to as `` blm '' corrections  @xcite , which are proportional to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the first coefficient in the qcd beta function .",
    "it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that these terms are not likely to be as large in @xmath11 as in , for example @xmath16 , because of the cancellation of the leading renormalon ambiguity .",
    "indeed , our explicit calculation will show that these terms contribute only at the level of ten percent .",
    "third , in ref .",
    "@xcite , we also included the leading nonperturbative contributions to the inclusive decay , which come from annihilation processes and are proportional to @xmath17 .",
    "these terms are formally of order @xmath18 but are enhanced by the two - body , rather than three - body , phase space of the final state .",
    "we found that in charged @xmath1 decays , these processes can contribute at the order of 5% , while in neutral @xmath1 decays they turn out to be negligible .",
    "we will have little new to say about these corrections , except that we will attempt to combine the uncertainties from these contributions with those from the radiative corrections to obtain an overall picture of the reliability of the theoretical calculation .",
    "we will also take the opportunity to include an additional small `` hybrid '' contribution of order @xmath19 .",
    "we will also propose that it is useful to consider a second ratio , @xmath3/\\gamma(b\\to c\\bar ud')$ ] .",
    "we will see that @xmath20 is theoretically clean in a way which is similar to @xmath11 , and we will extend all aspects of our analysis of @xmath11 to include @xmath20 .",
    "the experimental measurement of @xmath20 would certainly be challenging , but the challenges would be distinct from those that confront the measurement of @xmath11 and this second ratio deserves separate consideration .    finally , we will close by presenting an overall picture of the theoretical understanding of @xmath11 and @xmath20 , with our best estimate of the remaining uncertainties and the future prospects for reducing them .",
    "we hope that this will provide an intriguing goal for our experimental colleagues to aim for .",
    "in our previous paper  @xcite , we proposed that the quark level process @xmath22 would be a promising mode from which to extract @xmath0 .",
    "final states with this combination of quark flavors arise only from processes proportional to @xmath0 , with no contributions from penguin diagrams or long distance rescattering . in the form of the ratio @xmath23",
    "the theoretical expression is very well behaved .",
    "the phase space dependence on @xmath24 is identical in the numerator and denominator , as are the leading nonperturbative corrections of order @xmath25 . at tree level and in the limit @xmath26 ,",
    "then , we have simply @xmath27 in ref .",
    "@xcite , we first included radiative corrections at leading logarithmic order , which has the effect of multiplying the expression for @xmath11 by a factor @xmath28 .",
    "we also computed the leading radiative correction to the decay processes @xmath22 and @xmath29 , which although formally subleading is numerically substantial .",
    "the result was an expression of the form @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the one loop radiative correction is @xmath33 , so indeed it is large and should be included .",
    "however , the scale @xmath34 at which @xmath35 ought to be evaluated was not fixed by our calculation , leading to a significant remaining uncertainty .",
    "this can be resolved only with a full next - to - leading order calculation , which we will perform in the next section .",
    "we will find that the partial calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite was correct to within approximately 20% .",
    "unfortunately , the experimental measurement of @xmath11 is extremely challenging .",
    "the largest background to observing the quark level process @xmath22 is @xmath36 , the rate for which is approximately a factor of 100 larger .",
    "the measurement is made more difficult by the fact that the only quantity which is well predicted theoretically is the ratio of fully _ inclusive _ rates , while many of the experimental techniques for rejecting @xmath36 involve tagging on a particular hadronic final state .",
    "although the measurement of @xmath11 may be feasible , it will hardly be straightforward .",
    "nevertheless , relevant experimental techniques already are being developed  @xcite , and the excellent capability of the babar and belle detectors to vertex individually the boosted @xmath1 mesons also will improve the prospects for this measurement  @xcite .",
    "there is another ratio which one might consider , which avoids the necessity of rejecting the @xmath36 background .",
    "let @xmath37 be the fully inclusive production of @xmath38 in nonleptonic @xmath39 decays , and @xmath40 be the inclusive production of @xmath41 . also , define @xmath42 , that is , the inclusive production of @xmath38 _ without _ an accompanying @xmath41 .",
    "note that @xmath43 , so the measurement of @xmath44 does not require rejecting an overwhelming background .",
    "then let @xmath45 we see that @xmath46 cancels in the numerator of @xmath20 .",
    "in terms of quark level transitions , @xmath47 at tree level , @xmath48 . unlike in @xmath11",
    ", there is no leading logarithmic correction to @xmath49 , since these contribute identically to the numerator and the denominator .",
    "the leading radiative correction arises at order @xmath12 , and the leading nonperturbative corrections at order @xmath19 and @xmath50 .",
    "the experimental advantage of @xmath20 is that the large @xmath51 background cancels .",
    "the difficulty is that in order for @xmath20 to be sensitive to @xmath52 , both @xmath53 and @xmath44 must be measured with an accuracy of better than 1% .",
    "this may prove to be as challenging as rejecting @xmath36 , or even more so , but it involves a distinct set of problems .",
    "it will be up to the experimental community to determine whether this measurement is feasible or not .",
    "a quantity which would be more attractive experimentally is @xmath54 since doing so avoids the requirement of determining @xmath44 precisely .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath55 can not be computed with the very small uncertainties of @xmath11 and @xmath20 .",
    "this is simply because , unlike @xmath11 and @xmath20 , the calculation of @xmath55 requires that the ratio @xmath56 be known with a theoretical accuracy of better than 1% .",
    "this is well beyond the level of precision presently attainable , due to the perturbative and nonperturbative contributions which we will discuss below .",
    "thus , we will not consider @xmath55 further .",
    "however , we do note that in anticipation of theoretical advances , it may well be useful for experimentalists to measure @xmath55 as well as @xmath11 and @xmath20 . alternatively",
    ", if @xmath57 could itself be _ measured _ with the required precision , then it could be used to construct @xmath20 from the experimentally more accessible ratio @xmath55 .",
    "@xcite , we included two subsets of radiative corrections .",
    "first , we used an effective lagrangian evaluated at the scale @xmath58 , @xmath59+{\\rm h.c.}\\,.\\ ] ] employing such a lagrangian has the effect of summing all logarithms of the form @xmath60 . at leading log order , @xmath61 and @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "second , we performed a partial one - loop calculation of the radiative correction to the decay rate itself .",
    "although we included the largest contributions , our calculation was incomplete because we omitted terms which were not proportional to @xmath63 .",
    "this allowed us to consider only gluon exchanges within color - singlet currents , simplifying the result enormously . at leading log order terms of this form",
    "contribute 96% of the total decay rate , so we hoped that the error from this approximation would not be too large . the combined radiative correction which we found , keeping all terms of order @xmath60 and of order @xmath35 but only _ some _ of order @xmath64 , was @xmath65 $ ] , where @xmath66 came from qcd running between @xmath67 and @xmath68 and @xmath69 was a finite radiative correction to the decay rate . for @xmath31 and @xmath70 ,",
    "this gave 1.32 , or a combined correction of about 30% .",
    "the largest ambiguity in this result comes from the scale @xmath34 at which the one - loop correction to the decay process is to be evaluated .",
    "this ambiguity can be removed only by performing a full calculation at next - to - leading log order , including consistently all terms of order @xmath13 .",
    "we present the results of such a calculation here .",
    "we have followed closely the analogous calculation of @xmath71 by bagan _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , and have used their partial results where appropriate .",
    "we refer the reader to the excellent exposition of ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion of the method of the analysis , and here present only our results .",
    "a brief synopsis of our calculation is found in the appendix .",
    "we write the answer in the form @xmath72 where @xmath73 are of order @xmath35 . here",
    "@xmath34 is the renormalization scale and @xmath24 is the ratio of the heavy quark pole masses .",
    "we take @xmath74 for @xmath75 , which is in this process an excellent approximation even for the strange quark .    taking the reference",
    "values @xmath76gev , @xmath77gev ( so @xmath31 ) , and @xmath78gev , we find @xmath79 because the leading logarithms cancel in the ratio @xmath49 , @xmath80 starts at order @xmath35 rather than at order @xmath81 and is considerably smaller than @xmath82 . in fig .",
    "[ radplots ] , we display the variation of @xmath83 with @xmath84 and @xmath34 .    in fig .",
    "[ radplots]a , we vary @xmath68 between @xmath85gev and @xmath86gev , fixing @xmath87 by the heavy quark symmetry constraint @xmath88gev and taking @xmath58 .",
    "we see that the dependence on @xmath84 is very mild ; over the conservative range considered , @xmath82 varies by @xmath89 and @xmath80 by @xmath90 . in fig .",
    "[ radplots]b , we fix @xmath91gev and vary @xmath34 between @xmath92 and @xmath93 . for @xmath80 ,",
    "the dependence is soft , approximately @xmath90 .",
    "however , for @xmath82 a significant @xmath34-dependence remains even at next - to - leading order . for @xmath34 as low as @xmath92",
    ", we have @xmath94 .",
    "we will choose to assign an asymmetrical error of @xmath95 to the @xmath34-dependence of @xmath82 . combining the variation in @xmath84 and @xmath34 ,",
    "then , we find the results @xmath96 in the partial calculation of our previous paper , we found @xmath97 , to be compared with @xmath98 here .",
    "we now see that this approximation underestimated the correct next - to - leading order result by 0.08 , or 20% . while our incomplete treatment gave a reasonable result , including the full calculation at this order turns out to be important .",
    "at the next order in @xmath35 , a consistent leading - log calculation requires the three - loop anomalous dimensions of the operators in @xmath99 and the two - loop matrix elements .",
    "however , since the effects of the running are not large , a useful estimate of these corrections is obtained by simply taking the two - loop matrix element of the singlet operator ; this corresponds to neglecting terms of order @xmath100 relative to @xmath101 .",
    "a further simplification is obtained by only retaining the so - called `` blm '' two - loop corrections  @xcite , which are enhanced by a factor of @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the number of light quark flavors .",
    "we used in the previous section to evaluate the coefficients in the effective lagrangian , we only interpret the blm correction as an estimate of the full two - loop matrix elements , not as providing information on the scale at which the one - loop corrections should be evaluated .",
    "we also do not include charm among the light quarks at the scale @xmath58 .",
    "] this class of two - loop corrections is computed easily by performing a weighted integral over the one - loop result calculated with a gluon mass  @xcite .",
    "while the blm corrections are not formally dominant in any limit of qcd , in many processes they are found empirically to be the largest part of the two - loop term . in this section",
    "we calculate the blm corrections to @xmath11 and @xmath49 .",
    "these ratios require the blm corrections to @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the calculation of the blm corrections to @xmath107 is identical to that for @xmath108  @xcite with one of the charm quark masses set to zero , so we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "the corrections are particularly simple because the corrections to the @xmath109 and @xmath110 currents factorize .",
    "this feature also allows the blm corrections to @xmath111 to be extracted easily from existing calculations of the semileptonic decay rate and @xmath112 .",
    "finally , the blm corrections to semileptonic @xmath113 decays were calculated in ref .",
    "writing each decay rate as @xmath114 we plot the @xmath115 s in fig .",
    "[ aplots ] for each of the relevant decays .",

    "( [ gdef ] ) .",
    "the reason is that neither the blm correction nor @xmath69 has a logarithmic dependence on @xmath67 .",

    "in addition to the perturbative corrections discussed so far , there are also nonperturbative contributions to @xmath11 and @xmath49 which are sensitive to the configuration of the initial @xmath1 meson . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the cancellation of the tree level phase space factor eliminates terms in @xmath11 of order @xmath124 . furthermore , while there could be in principle subleading terms at order @xmath25 proportional to the hqet parameters @xmath125 and @xmath126  @xcite , these cancel in the ratio as well .",
    "this can be understood by examining the possible sources of dependence on the charm quark mass .",
    "these corrections enter the calculations of @xmath22 and @xmath71 either from kinematic phase space functions or from performing spin sums .",
    "consider the fierzed form of the effective lagrangian ( [ leff ] ) , @xmath127+{\\rm h.c.}\\,.\\ ] ] substituting @xmath128 and @xmath129 , and exchanging @xmath130 and @xmath38 , we obtain the lagrangian responsible for @xmath131 .",
    "recall that we take @xmath132 .",
    "the calculation of the decay @xmath71 involves the computation of the polarization tensor with a massive @xmath38 quark and a massless @xmath133 antiquark , whereas the @xmath22 decay involves a massless @xmath130 and a massive @xmath41 .",
    "hence the fierz transformation by itself does not guarantee the cancellation of all terms in the ratios @xmath134 .",
    "however , because of the @xmath135 structure of the polarization tensor , and the fact that @xmath136 and @xmath137 correlation functions are symmetric under @xmath138  @xcite , the total decay rate is also symmetric under interchange of the quark masses .",
    "thus , both the phase space and @xmath25 corrections cancel in @xmath49 . to extend the argument to @xmath11 , note that in the fierzed form and at tree level , the decay @xmath139 is the same as @xmath140 , for which the nonperturbative corrections were computed in ref .",
    "this discussion elaborates the observation made in ref .",
    "@xcite that these corrections cancel . a general argument that the terms proportional to @xmath125 ( but not to @xmath126 ) cancel in all ratios of @xmath1 decays was given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there remain , however , mixed terms proportional to @xmath141 , which need not cancel in the ratios . recall that @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the effective @xmath39 field of hqet , is related to the hyperfine interaction of the @xmath39 quark chromomagnetic moment with the light degrees of freedom in the @xmath1 meson  @xcite .",

    "come from two sources .",
    "first , they arise from one - loop radiative corrections to the operator product expansion itself , in which case they are quite small .",
    "second , the color structure allows terms proportional to @xmath145 to arise at tree level from the interference of the color singlet and color exchanged operators .",
    "these terms are really of order @xmath146 and hence are enhanced over the others .",
    "they were first calculated for the decay @xmath131 in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in fact , a straightforward argument shows that these terms are equal in size and of the opposite sign in @xmath22 as compared to @xmath71 .",
    "consider again the fierzed form of the effective lagrangian ( [ leff2 ] ) .",
    "because of the color structure when the operators are written in this form , the term proportional to @xmath147 is generated by attaching a gluon to the @xmath148 loop , performing the operator product expansion , and extracting the chromomagnetic moment operator @xmath149 .",
    "this term is odd under the exchange @xmath150 and @xmath151 , or equivalently @xmath152 , which can be seen immediately by inspection of the relevant feynman diagrams .",
