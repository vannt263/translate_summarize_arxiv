    "perhaps the gauge hierarchy problem is main difficulty of the grand unified theories ( gut ) .",
    "this problem can be stated into the following questions : a ) why is the electro - weak scale stable against the radiative corrections ?",
    "b ) how do the higgs doublets remain light , whereas their colour triplet partners must be superheavy in order to avoid fast proton decay ?",
    "as it is well - known [ 1 ] supersymmetry ( susy ) answers the first question , if its breaking scale is @xmath8 tev .",
    "this is one of the main motivations for the low energy susy .",
    "several attempts to answer the second question ( which is known as dt splitting problem ) were suggested in the literature .",
    "possible solution to the dt splitting problem to be explored below could be due `` custodial symmetry '' mechanism .",
    "[ 2 ] ( which is discussed sect .",
    "it is well known that the combined analysis , including the heavy and light threshold corrections , in the minimal @xmath7 gut predicts a value of @xmath9[3 ] when the superpartners masses are at the tev scale .",
    "if the sparticle masses are at the @xmath10 gev scale the predicted value of @xmath4 is @xmath11 .",
    "on the other hand it is known that from @xmath12-peak we have @xmath13 [ 4 ]    so to reduce the predictions of @xmath4 in the susy gut one needs a high value of @xmath5 which , on the other hand , is unnatural for the stability of the electro - weak scale .    among the existing attempts to solve this problem",
    "we quote one the @xmath7 susy theory with missing partner mechanism with a scalar content @xmath14 ; @xmath15 and @xmath16 representation .",
    "as was shown [ 3 ] the heavy threshold effects coming from those multiplets at the gut scale make possible to get a low value of @xmath4 when @xmath17 1 tev .",
    "another attempt was proposed by brahmachari and mohapatra [ 5 ] in the susy @xmath18 theory with intermediate gauge @xmath19 symmetry at scale @xmath20 .    in the present paper",
    "we propose an alternative scenario : in our case we have @xmath21 intermediate scale which is independently motivated from the natural solution of the doublet - triplet splitting problem , and at the same time is an outcome of the theory in terms of the gut and the week ( or low energy susy breaking ) scale .",
    "using split - multiplet mechanism is possible to make unification for all the reasonable values of @xmath22 and @xmath5 .",
    "consider a @xmath23 gut based on @xmath24 gauge symmetry with a minimal set of higgs superfields needed for the breaking of @xmath24 symmetry down to sm .",
    "these are adjoint 35-plet ( @xmath25 ) and a pair of fundamental @xmath26-plets @xmath27 .",
    "the most general @xmath24 invariant renormalizable scalar superpotential of the higgs superfields has the following form : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the dimensionless constants , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are mass parameters ( we suppose that m @xmath33 m )",
    ". one of the possible vev configuration of this fields ( in unbroken susy limit ) is : @xmath34\\frac{m}{\\lambda}+diag[2~ 2~ 2~ -3~ -3~0 ] \\frac{m}{h }     \\nonumber \\\\",

    "obviously , in this case we have no light higgs doublets .",
    "now let us consider an extension of the @xmath24 symmetry to @xmath41 [ 2 ] , where we introduce @xmath42 - plet superfields @xmath43 transforming as @xmath44 representations of @xmath45 .",
    "we have the following superpotential @xmath46    and we choose the solution for which a single pair @xmath47 ( say for a = 1 ) develops a vev .",
    "the vevs of @xmath25 and @xmath48 have the ( 2 ) form and relevant mass matrix for doublet ( antidoublet ) fragments from @xmath25 and @xmath49 is :    @xmath50\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath51 stands for a doublet ( antidoublet ) from the suitable representation and @xmath52    the zero mass eigenstates of the above mass matrix    @xmath53[b+a]^{-1/2}$ ] + @xmath54[b+a]^{-1/2}$ ]    are eaten up goldstone superfields .",
    "the orthogonal superpositions get the large masses @xmath35 .",
    "as it is clear from eq.(4 ) the physical higgs doublet from the @xmath55 automatically acquire small masses ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "so , we get @xmath57 pairs of the physical higgs doublets with masses @xmath58",
    "as was shown in [ 6 ] in the case of @xmath59-symmetry we have no acceptable unification of the gauge constants . from the unification condition",
    "we get that `` custodial '' symmetry must be larger than @xmath60 . on the other hand the @xmath61 symmetry case exhibits is the problem in the fermion sector , namely for the top quark mass .",
    "this is because the masses of the `` up '' type quarks are induced from the following effective nonrenormalizable couplings ( a , b.c is the indexes of @xmath62 symmetry )    @xmath63    ( where @xmath64 is singlet under @xmath24 symmetry and suppose @xmath65 ) that are trough the generated by heavy particle exchange [ 10 ] , transforming as @xmath66 end @xmath67 representations .",
    "if we assume that @xmath66 end @xmath68 multiplets(or one of them ) have masses @xmath69 , in this case the gauge couplings will enter in the nonperturbative regime before unification point .",
    "increasing masses of @xmath70 end @xmath67 multiplets , say @xmath71 , will decrease the top mass unacceptably . we will show that this problem is solved in @xmath72 symmetry case .",
    "let us choose the higgs content of our @xmath73 model as : @xmath74.where the brackets are indicated their transformation properties under the @xmath75 group .",
    "we also introduce 3 pairs of @xmath1- triplet superfields @xmath76 ( i=1,2,3 ) and assume a @xmath77-symmetry under which @xmath78    consider the most general @xmath79-invariant renormalizable scalar superpotential .",
    "( @xmath1 indexes are omitted )    @xmath80    where @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the dimensionless constants , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the mass parameters .",
    "we assume that @xmath87 and @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are of order of @xmath91 .",
    "note that introduction of the small mass term @xmath92 and @xmath93 in ( 6 ) is not necessary , since it could be generated after susy breaking .",
    "namely , in the simplest version of the minimal @xmath94 supergravity susy violating terms lead to the well known scalar potential [ 7 ]    @xmath95+d - terms\\ ] ]    it is clear , that if one puts @xmath96 @xmath97 in ( 6 ) the mass term @xmath98 and @xmath99  will be automatically generated from ( 7 ) .    among the discretely degenerate susy minima of ( 6 ) the one of our interest is :      where    @xmath101 +    @xmath102 +    in this vacuum the hierarchy of the symmetry breakings is the following : at the scale @xmath103 the gauge @xmath1 symmetry is broken down to @xmath104 by the @xmath25 and @xmath105 which develop the large @xmath106 vevs , at the `` geometrical scale '' @xmath107 the vevs @xmath108 break @xmath39 down to @xmath109 .",
    "so , according to a general argument of sec.2 in this case we have the two pairs of light higgs doublets .    according to the standard scenario of @xmath110 breaking by radiative corrections [ 8 ] the main negative contribution to",
    "the one of the light higgs @xmath111 ^ 2 $ ] comes from the loops with the matter fermions , corrections by the top quark exchange ( due to its largest yukawa coupling constant).the other ones do not have coupling with light matter fermions ( as it is shown in section 4 ) so the flavour changing neutral processes are avoided .",
    "we place each generation of quark  -  lepton superfields we place in the set of anomaly free set of @xmath1 representations .",
    "these are two @xmath112 , @xmath113 and three @xmath36 representations which we denote as @xmath114 and @xmath115 and is the indexe of @xmath116 symmetry ) respectively .",
    "their decompositions under the @xmath117 subgroup are    @xmath118    @xmath119    the masses of the quarks and leptons are generated by the following `` yukawa '' couplings :    a)@xmath120 for the `` down '' type quarks and leptons    b )   @xmath121 for the `` up '' type quarks    for the heavy multiplets we have the following `` yukawa '' couplings .",

    "for example , this term can be easily generated trough the heavy ( with mass @xmath126 ) particle exchange [ 10 ] , namely exchange of the representations of : @xmath127 and @xmath128 can do the job .",
    "the relevant couplings for the case ( d ) are    @xmath129    for the case ( c )    @xmath130    it is assumed that @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 are of order @xmath135    from the ( c ) and ( d ) couplings , the submultiplets : three pair of @xmath136 and one pair @xmath137 acquire masses of order @xmath103 . from the coupling ( e ) and",
    "( f ) a single pair @xmath138 acquire masses of order @xmath139 .",
    "thus , we have per family : @xmath140 submultiplets at the `` geometrical scale '' , and three pairs of the @xmath141 and one pair of the @xmath140 at the gut scale .",
    "besides the problem of the masses for quarks and leptons which could be solved in the above mentioned way there is a problem of unification . because extension of the model with the intermediate scale the unification of the gauge couplings in general may be spoiled .",
    "so , we consider extension of the model , as to include not only chiral superfields but also vector - like fermionic superfields ( vlfs ) .",
    "imagine that we have all possible antisymmetric and fundamental vector - like fermionic representations    @xmath142 ;   @xmath143 ;  @xmath144    the following terms are possible in the `` yukawa '' superpotential : @xmath145 where @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 are dimensionless constants and @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 are mass parameters of order @xmath156 . as was shown @xmath25s field vev",
    "has the form :    @xmath157 + o(m_{3/2})$ ]    it is easy to check that @xmath158 terms can not generate masses of the following fragments    @xmath159    @xmath160    ( these are submultiplets under the @xmath161 subgroup of @xmath1 ) the others acquire masses of order @xmath71 .",
    "the multiplets @xmath162 get mass of order @xmath71 .",
    "this mechanism is known as the split - multiplet mechanism and was proposed in ref [ 9 ] . from the @xmath163 terms",
    "the split fragments get masses @xmath164 and if we suppose that @xmath165 are in the @xmath166 interval we have the split fragments in @xmath167 gev region which lead to the successful unification ( see table 1 ) and this scale we denote as @xmath168",
    "now , let us begin the renormalization group ( rg ) analysis of our model .",
    "the two - loop rg equations for the running gauge couplings of general effective @xmath169 gauge theory have the well known form @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the running gauge constant corresponding to @xmath172 group , while @xmath173 and @xmath174 are one and two - loop b - factors [ 11 ] respectively .",
    "there are three energy regions in our case @xmath175 , @xmath176 , and @xmath177 where the b - factors are :    1 )  @xmath178 , sm region @xmath179 here @xmath180 is the number of light higgs doublets ;    2 )  @xmath176 , susy sm region @xmath181 3 )  @xmath177 region @xmath182    in addition we have to compute the contributions of split - fragments from @xmath183 and @xmath184 @xmath185 we assume that they begin to play the role only from the energy scale @xmath168 , where @xmath168 is a free parameter which fixed from the unification condition : @xmath186    and the value of this scale we can explain from ( 9 ) .",
    "the gauge couplings @xmath187 correspond to @xmath188 gauge groups ( in the @xmath189 region ) respectively . at the scale @xmath190 they are related to @xmath191 , and @xmath192 gauge couplings which correspond to @xmath193 groups ( in the @xmath194 region ) respectively , by equations : @xmath195",
    "we have solved equations ( 13 ) numerically with b - factors ( 14 ) , ( 15 ) , ( 16 ) , ( 17 ) and conditions ( 18 ) , ( 19 ) using as input parameters [ 12 ] @xmath196 the result of computations for the low values of ( 17 ) for @xmath4 end low values of @xmath197 is presented in fig .",
    "1 . we have also plotted the flow of running gauge coupling constants in table 1    note that the grand unification scale is close to @xmath3 .",
    "such a large unification scale avoids the standard susy gut troubles with @xmath6 operator induced baryon decay , since the higgsino mass in our case is of the order of @xmath198 gev ( whereas in the standard susy gut it is @xmath199 gev ) , so the proton lifetime is increased relatively to the standard susy gut case by the factor @xmath200 and no constraints on the susy parameter space are required .",
    "we have studied the @xmath1 susy gut with the `` custodial symmetry '' mechanism for the explanation of the dt hierarchy , which naturally leads to existence of the intermediate @xmath201 symmetry scale @xmath190 in the desert between @xmath5 and @xmath202 .    to obtain the gauge coupling unification",
    "we have introduced an additional pair of light higgs doublets and split the vector - like matter superfields .    as it is shown in this model",
    "it is possible to get unification of the gauge coupling constants for all the reasonable values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 and a correct value of @xmath2 .",
    "since the unification scale is close to @xmath3 , there is no problem with @xmath6 operator induced baryon decay .",
    "on the other hand , the introduction of four light doublets give the chance to obtain the correct value not only for @xmath203 but also for @xmath204 in the manner of ref.[13 ] .",
