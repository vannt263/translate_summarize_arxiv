    "the problem of finding necessary and sufficient conditions for a map to be a strong local minimiser of a given functional is a fundamental question in the calculus of variations .",
    "the scalar case was first solved by weierstrass and later , hestenes @xcite extended these results by considering minimisers that allow more than one independent variable .    regarding the vectorial case ,",
    "the problem has received considerable attention over the past decades . in @xcite zhang",
    "proved a sufficiency theorem in which the strong quasiconvexity of the integrand is used to prove that smooth solutions to the weak euler - lagrange equations are spatially - local minimisers .",
    "in other words , this means that minimality can be obtained when considering sufficiently small domains .",
    "ball conjectured in @xcite that a natural way to extend the weierstrass theory to the vectorial case had to be based on the conditions of quasiconvexity at the interior and at the boundary , the latter having been introduced in @xcite and shown to be a necessary condition for strong local minima ( see also @xcite for other works related to the notion of quasiconvexity at the boundary ) .",
    "more precisely , ball s conjecture states that under suitable quasiconvexity conditions , if a map is sufficiently smooth , satisfies the weak euler - lagrange equations and the strict positivity of the second variation , then it is a strong local minimiser .",
    "further achievements for the vectorial case were obtained in @xcite .",
    "in addition , kristensen and taheri showed that , under strong quasiconvexity and @xmath1-growth conditions , @xmath2-local minimisers are _ partially regular _ ,",
    "i.e. , of class @xmath3 almost everywhere in their domain .",
    "their result extended the partial regularity that evans had established for the first time for global minimisers under similar assumptions on the integrand @xcite . furthermore , and in contrast with the previous achievements on the vectorial problem , kristensen and taheri modified the remarkable example by mller and verk in @xcite to construct a strongly quasiconvex integrand with strictly positive second variation , such that the corresponding weak euler - lagrange equations admit lipschitz solutions that are not @xmath2-local minimisers @xcite .",
    "this made it clear that lipschitz regularity of the extremal is not enough to ensure strong local minimality .",
    "szkelyhidi extended further the example of kristensen and taheri to the case of polyconvex integrands @xcite .",
    "however , it was only until the seminal paper @xcite of grabovsky and mengesha that the conjecture of ball was settled .",
    "they showed that , for domains of class @xmath0 , a strong version of the aforementioned quasiconvexity conditions is in fact sufficient for a @xmath0 map to be a strong local minimiser of an integral functional under specific growth and coercivity assumptions on the integrand .",
    "the aim of the current work is to address the vectorial problem without the @xmath0 regularity assumption on the domain but instead allowing certain types of singularities of the boundary .",
    "more specifically , we establish a quasiconvexity - based sufficiency result for minimisers defined on domains that are locally diffeomorphic to a polytope ( see definition [ def : domains ] for a precise definition ) .    similarly to the work in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that when complemented with the satisfaction of the weak euler - lagrange equations and the ( strong ) positivity of the second variation , a strong version of the quasiconvexity in the interior and the suitably adapted conditions of quasiconvexity at the singular boundary are indeed sufficient for a @xmath0 map to be a strong local minimiser .",
    "the need to extend the weierstrass theory to domains of this type arises naturally in view of applications .",
    "for example , models based on energy minimisation , and consequently the techniques of the vectorial calculus of variations , have been very successful in materials science where typical specimens are polyhedral .",
    "indeed , the work presented here has been largely motivated by that in @xcite where , in a simplified model , a set of quasiconvexity conditions at edges and corners of a ( convex ) polyhedral domain was employed to explain remarkable experimental observations in shape - memory alloys ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we remark that quasiconvexity conditions at points of the boundary with conical singularities were first discussed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 2 ) but , to the best of the authors knowledge , this idea had not been previously applied ( see remark [ remark : cone ] ) .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : definitions ] , we state the general assumptions under which we establish our results .",
    "we further give all the required definitions on our domains as well as the generalised quasiconvexity conditions at the singular boundary .",
    "in section [ sec : necessity ] , we show that all these quasiconvexity at the boundary conditions are indeed necessary for a strong local minimiser and , in section [ sec : sufficiency ] , we state and prove the corresponding quasiconvexity - based sufficiency theorem which generalises the result of @xcite to the case of domains locally diffeomorphic to a polytope .",
    "our strategy , broadly motivated by the work in @xcite , crucially uses a generalisation of zhang s result on spatially - local minimisers .",
    "the proof of this generalisation , in the general case under consideration , becomes notationally involved and potentially difficult to follow its , otherwise , simple and clear ideas .",
    "hence , for the convenience of the reader , the lemma is proved in the simpler case of the domain being itself a polytope , though the result is stated for the general case .",
    "the interested reader is referred to section  [ sec : appenddiffeom ] for a full proof of the lemma .",
    "let @xmath4 be a bounded lipschitz domain ( i.e. open and connected ) and consider an integral functional of the form @xmath5 which is to be minimised over a set of admissible maps @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and the function @xmath8 is continuous .",
