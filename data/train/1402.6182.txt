    "the scientific motivation of neutrino telescopes relies on the unique properties of neutrinos , which can be used to observe and study the high - energy universe .",
    "cosmic rays or high - energy photons have intrinsic limitations : the mean free path of gamma - ray photons strongly depends on their energy , while magnetic fields deflect cosmic rays , diluting the information about their origin .",
    "neutrinos are stable , neutral and weakly interacting particles , and therefore they point directly back to their origin . in addition , neutrinos are expected to originate at the same locations where the acceleration of cosmic rays and the associated production of high - energy photons take place @xcite .",
    "the first evidence of such a cosmic neutrino signal has recently been reported by icecube  @xcite , including in particular a cluster of events close to the galactic centre .",
    "the better view of the southern hemisphere afforded by the antares neutrino telescope , due to its location in the mediterranean sea , provides an increased sensitivity to galactic sources of neutrinos with energies @xmath5 100 tev .",
    "this is particularly important in order to interpret the cluster of events observed by icecube close to the galactic centre .    in this paper",
    "the results of the search for point sources with the data gathered between 2007 and 2012 with the antares neutrino telescope are presented . after a brief description of the apparatus , the data selection and the corresponding detector performance",
    "are presented in sections  [ antaresdet ] and  [ performance ] , respectively . in section  [ method ] , the search method is explained .",
    "the results of the full - sky and candidate sources searches are presented in section  [ results ] .",
    "the implications on some recent interpretations of the icecube results are discussed in section  [ implications ] .",
    "finally , the conclusions are given in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "antares is an underwater neutrino telescope located 40 km to the south of toulon ( france ) in the mediterranean sea ( 42@xmath6 48 n , 6@xmath6 10 e ) @xcite .",
    "it is made of 12 slender lines spaced by about 65 m , anchored on the seabed at 2475 m depth and maintained vertical by a buoy .",
    "each line of 350 m active length comprises 25 floors spaced regularly , each housing 3 photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) looking downward at an angle of 45@xmath6 .",
    "the detection principle is based on the observation of the cherenkov light induced by muons produced in charged current interactions of high energy neutrinos inside or near the detector volume .",
    "some of the emitted photons produce a signal in the pmts ( `` hits '' ) with the corresponding charge and time information .",
    "the hits are used to reconstruct the direction of the muon .",
    "in addition , other neutrino signatures such as cascade events are also detected and reconstructed .",
    "the current analysis uses muon tracks only , which offer a better angular resolution and larger volume than cascades caused by showering events .",
    "high quality runs are selected from data between january 29 , 2007 to december 31 , 2012 .",
    "this measurment period corresponds to a total livetime of 1338 days , which is an increase of 70% compared to the previous antares point - source analysis @xcite .",
    "triggered events are reconstructed using the time and position information of the hits by means of a maximum likelihood ( ml ) method @xcite .",
    "the algorithm consists of a multi - step procedure to fit the direction of the reconstructed muon by maximising the ml - parameter @xmath7 , which describes the quality of the reconstruction .",
    "in addition , the uncertainty of the track direction angle , @xmath8 , is calculated .",
    "this calculation is estimated from the uncertainty on the zenith and azimuth angles drawn from the covariance matrix .    , for tracks with @xmath9 which have an angular error estimate @xmath10 .",
    "the bottom panel shows the ratio between data and simulation .",
    "the green ( red ) distribution corresponds to the simulated atmospheric muons ( neutrinos ) , where a 50% ( 30% ) relative error was assigned @xcite .",
    "data errors correspond to statistical errors only . ]",
    "neutrinos and atmospheric muons are simulated with the genhen @xcite and mupage @xcite packages , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the propagation of the muon tracks is simulated with the km3 package @xcite .",
    "a data versus simulation comparison of the @xmath7 distribution for zenith angles @xmath11 with @xmath12 0.1 can be seen in figure [ lambdafig ] , where the atmospheric neutrino simulation uses the bartol flux @xcite .",
    "events are selected following a blind procedure on pseudo - experiments before performing the analysis on data .",
    "the cuts on reconstructed tracks ( @xmath135.2 , @xmath14 1@xmath6 and @xmath15 0.1 ) are chosen so that the neutrino flux needed to make a 5@xmath2 discovery in 50% of the experiments is minimised .",
    "this selection leads to a final data sample of 5516 events , which includes an estimated 10% background from mis - reconstructed atmospheric muons .",
    "for a neutrino energy spectrum proportional to e@xmath3 , the angular resolution and acceptance for events passing the selection cuts are computed .",
    "an improved modelling of the pmt transit - time distribution compared to ref .",
    "@xcite has been used for the simulation . as a result ,",
    "the estimated median neutrino angular resolution is 0.38@xmath6 , which corresponds to a 15% improvement .",
    "figure [ angres - acc ] ( left ) shows the cumulative distribution of the angle @xmath16 between the reconstructed muon direction and the true neutrino direction .",
    "the distribution is represented both for the whole data set ( blue line ) and for the previous analysis ( dashed red line ) .",
    "the `` acceptance '' is defined as the quantity that multiplied by a given flux , @xmath17 , gives the number of signal events .",
    "this quantity is proportional to the detector response and depends on the source energy spectrum and declination .",
    "the acceptance for a source located at a declination @xmath18 is    @xmath19    where the time integration extends over the whole period of 1338 days and @xmath20 is the neutrino effective area .",
    "the acceptance as a function of the declination @xmath18 is shown in figure [ angres - acc ] ( right ) .",
    "signal events are expected to accumulate in clusters over a background of diffusely distributed atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "the search for clusters is performed using a maximum - likelihood estimation , which describes the data as a mixture of a signal and background probability density functions ( pdfs ) :    @xmath21    both the background and the signal pdfs , @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively , depend on the reconstructed direction , @xmath24 = ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) ( where @xmath25 and @xmath26 indicate the reconstructed right ascension and declination , respectively ) , for the @xmath27-th event . the parameter @xmath28 represents the expected number of signal events for a particular source and n , the total number of events in the sample .",
    "the signal pdf is defined as    @xmath29    where @xmath30 = ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) indicates the position of the source and @xmath33 is the probability for a signal event @xmath27 at a position @xmath24 to be reconstructed with an angular error estimate of @xmath34 and a number of hits @xmath35 .",
    "the number of hits @xmath35 is a proxy for the energy of the event .",
    "the background pdf is described as    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the probability to find an event at a declination @xmath26 and @xmath38 is the probability for a background event to be reconstructed with a number of hits @xmath35 and an angular error estimate of @xmath34 .",
    "the significance of any observation is determined by the test statistic , ts , which is defined as ts = @xmath39 , where @xmath40 indicates the likelihood value for the background only case ( @xmath28 = 0 ) .",
    "larger ts values indicate a lower probability ( p - value ) of the observation to be produced by the expected background .",
    "a full - sky search and a search on an a pre - selected list of candidate sources are performed .",
    "the full - sky search looks for an excess of signal events located anywhere in the whole antares visible sky . a pre - clustering algorithm to select candidate clusters of at least 4 events in a cone of half - opening angle of 3@xmath6 is performed . for each cluster , @xmath41 is maximised by variying the free parameters @xmath30 and n@xmath42 . in this analysis ,",
    "the most significant cluster is found at ( @xmath43 , @xmath18 ) = ( @xmath046.8@xmath6 , @xmath064.9@xmath6 ) with a post - trial p - value of 2.7% ( significance of 2.2@xmath2 using the two - sided convention ) .",
    "this direction is consistent with the most significant cluster found in the previous analysis .",
    "the number of fitted signal events is @xmath44 6.2 .",
    "a total of 6 ( 14 ) events in a cone of 1@xmath6 ( 3@xmath6 ) around the fitted cluster centre are found .",
    "upper limits at the 90% confidence level ( c.l . ) on the muon neutrino flux from point sources located anywhere in the visible antares sky are given by the light blue - dashed line in figure [ sensitivity ] .",
    "each value corresponds to the highest upper - limit obtained in declination bands of 1@xmath6 .",
    "the second search uses a list of 50 neutrino candidate - source positions at which the likelihood is evaluated .",
    "the list of sources with their corresponding pre - trial p - values and flux upper limits is presented in table [ tab : cl ] .",
    "the largest excess corresponds to hess j0632 + 057 , with a post - trial p - value of 6.1% ( significance of 1.9@xmath2 using the two - sided convention ) .",
    "the fitted number of source events is @xmath28 = 1.6 .",
    "the limits for these 50 selected sources and the overall fixed - source sensitivity of the telescope are reported in figure [ sensitivity ] .",
    "the 90% c.l .",
    "flux upper limits and sensitivities are calculated by using the neyman method @xcite .    .",
    "the solid blue ( red ) line indicates the antares ( icecube ) sensitivity for a point - source with an @xmath45 spectrum as a function of the declination .",
    "the blue ( red ) squares represent the upper limits for the antares ( icecube ) candidate sources .",
    "finally , the dashed dark blue ( red ) line indicates the antares ( icecube ) sensitivity for a point - source and for neutrino energies lower than 100 tev , which shows that the icecube sensitivity for sources in the southern hemisphere is mostly due to events of higher energy .",
