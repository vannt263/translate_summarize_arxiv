    "plasmon - assisted hot carrier excitation and transfer across the interfaces @xcite has recently attracted intense interest due to wide - ranging applications in photovoltaics @xcite and photochemistry @xcite . in metal nanostructures with characteristic size @xmath0 below the diffraction limit ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are , respectively , the light speed and frequency , the light scattering is relatively weak , and the absorption is dominated by resonant excitation of surface plasmons , which subsequently decay into electron - hole ( _ e - h _ ) pairs through several decay mechanisms depending on the size and shape of a plasmonic system @xcite . while in relatively large systems , excitation of _",
    "e - h _ pairs with optical energy @xmath4 is accompanied by momentum relaxation due to phonon and impurity scattering , for systems with characteristic size @xmath5 or smaller , the dominant momentum relaxation channel is surface scattering that leads , in particular , to size and shape dependence of the plasmon linewidth @xcite .",
    "calculations of surface - assisted decay rate have been performed for some simple shapes ( mostly spherical ) within random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite or time - dependent local density approximation ( tddft ) @xcite approaches , while for general shape systems , the classical scattering model @xcite suggested the surface scattering rate in the form @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the ballistic electron scattering length , and the constant @xmath8 includes the effects of surface potential , electron spillover , and dielectric environment @xcite .",
    "note , however , that recent measurements of plasmon linewidth in nanostructures of various shapes revealed significant discrepancies with a simple @xmath9 dependence@xcite .",
    "here we present a quantum - mechanical model for surface - assisted excitation of _ e - h _ pairs by alternating local electric field of the form @xmath10 created in the metal either by excitation of a plasmon or as a response to monochromatic external field .",
    "we show that surface contribution to the absorbed power due to energy transfer to the excited carriers is given by @xmath11 where integration is taken over the metal surface , @xmath12 is the local field component _ normal _ to the interface , and @xmath13 is the fermi energy in the metal .",
    "the above expression , which is derived within rpa approach , is valid for systems of arbitrary shape that are significantly larger than the nonlocality scale @xmath14 @xcite , i.e. , for systems at least several nm large .",
    "we compute the surface enhancement of the carrier excitation efficiency for some common nanostructures and show that it is highly sensitive to the local field polarization and system geometry .",
    "we consider a metal nanostructure characterized by complex dielectric function @xmath15 in a medium with dielectric constant @xmath16 , and , for simplicity , restrict ourselves by systems with a single metal - dielectric interface .",
    "the standard expression for absorbed power has the form @xcite , @xmath17 where integration is carried over the metal volume , while the local field @xmath18 is determined , in the quasistatic limit , by the gauss s law @xmath19=0 $ ] [ here @xmath20 equals @xmath21 and @xmath16 in the metal and dielectric regions , respectively ] .",
    "the surface contribution to the absorbed power is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the first - order transition probability rate , leading to the standard rpa expression @xcite @xmath24 \\delta(\\epsilon_{\\alpha}-\\epsilon_{\\beta}+\\hbar\\omega).\\ ] ] here , @xmath25 is the matrix element of local potential @xmath26 defined as @xmath27 ( @xmath28 is the electron charge ) , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are wave - functions for electron states with energies @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively , separated by @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the fermi distribution function . for nanostructures of arbitrary shape , numerical evaluation of @xmath35 is a highly complicated task due to the complexity of electron wave functions .",
    "however , as we show below , for the hard - wall confining potential , @xmath36 can be derived in a closed form for any system significantly larger than @xmath14 ( but still smaller than @xmath37 ) .",
    "excitation of an _ e - h _ pair with a large , compared to the electron level spacing , energy @xmath33 requires momentum transfer to the cavity boundary .",
    "we note that the boundary contribution to @xmath35 can be presented as an integral over the metal surface @xcite , @xmath38^{*}e_{n}(\\bm{s } ) \\nabla_{n}\\psi_{\\beta}(\\bm{s}),\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the wave function derivative normal to the surface , @xmath40 is the corresponding normal field component , @xmath41 is the _ e - h _ pair excitation energy , and @xmath42 is the electron mass . using this matrix element , eq .",
    "( [ power - rpa ] ) takes the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the _ e - h _ surface correlation function , @xmath45 defined in terms of normal derivative of the electron cross density of states , @xmath46 , at surface points : @xmath47 . here",
    "@xmath48 is the confined electron green function , and the function @xmath49 restricts the initial energy of promoted electron to the interval @xmath33 below @xmath13 .    to evaluate @xmath36 , we note that excitation of an _ e - h _ pair with energy @xmath33 is accompanied by momentum transfer @xmath50 and , hence , takes place in a region of size @xmath51 , so that the _ e - h _ correlation function @xmath44 peaks in the region @xmath52 and rapidly oscillates outside of it ( see below ) . at the same time",
    ", the local fields significantly change on a much larger scale @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath54 , the main contribution to the integral in eq .",
    "( [ q - surface ] ) comes from the regions with @xmath55 , so that @xmath36 takes the form @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "evaluation of @xmath58 is based upon multiple - reflection expansion for the electron green function @xmath48 in a hard - wall cavity @xcite . for system s characteristic size @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the fermi wavelength",
    ", the main contribution comes from the direct and singly - reflected paths , while the higher - order reflections are suppressed as powers of @xmath61 . in the leading order ,",
    "we obtain @xmath62 , where @xmath63 , with @xmath64 , is the free electron green function and factor 2 comes from equal contributions of the direct and singly - reflected paths at a surface point @xcite .",
    "it is now easy to see that the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) peaks in the region @xmath65 and rapidly oscillates outside of it . for @xmath66 and @xmath67 ,",
    "this sets the scale @xmath68 for the _ e - h _ correlation function @xmath44 in eq .",

    "after computing normal derivatives in @xmath69 relative to the tangent plane at a surface point @xcite , we obtain @xmath70 , yielding eq .",
    "( [ power - surface ] ) .    the surface contribution @xmath36 to the full absorbed power @xmath71 should be considered in conjunction with its bulk counterpart @xmath72 , i.e. , @xmath73 .",
    "the bulk contribution is given by the standard expression ( [ power - bulk ] ) , where the metal dielectric function @xmath21 includes only the bulk processes . in the following ,",
    "we adopt the drude dielectric function @xmath74 , where @xmath75 describes interband transitions , @xmath76 is the plasma frequency , and @xmath77 is the scattering rate .",
    "in fact , both bulk and surface contributions can be combined , in a natural way , within the general expression ( [ power - bulk ] ) . indeed , using the relation @xmath78 ,",
    "the surface absorbed power ( [ power - surface ] ) can be recast as @xmath79 then , it is easy to see that the surface contribution can be incorporated into general expression ( [ power - bulk ] ) for the absorbed power by modifying the drude scattering rate as @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the usual bulk scattering rate and @xmath82 is the surface scattering rate . indeed , after this modification , @xmath36 can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ power - bulk ] ) as the first - order expansion term in @xmath83 , indicating that the surface scattering mechanism should be treated on par with phonon and impurity scattering .",
    "note that @xmath83 is independent of the local field overall strength but highly sensitive to its polarization relative to the metal - dielectric interface .    turning to the surface - assisted plasmon decay ( landau damping )",

    "( [ ld ] ) with surface - modified @xmath21 .",
    "note that for @xmath3 well below the interband transitions onset , the plasmon decay rate and scattering rate coincide , @xmath90 .",
    "let us now discuss the effect of field polarization and system geometry on the carrier excitation efficiency .",
    "the surface enhancement factor of the absorbed power is given by the ratio of full ( @xmath71 ) to bulk ( @xmath72 ) absorbed power , @xmath91 , which , within rpa , takes a simple form @xmath92 evaluation of surface scattering rate @xmath83 is made more convenient by noting that the gauss s law reduces the volume integral in eq .",
    "( [ rate - ld ] ) to the surface term , so that @xmath93 where real part of the denominator is implied .",
    "this form of @xmath83 as the ratio of two surface integrals reflects the fact that _ e - h _ pairs are excited in a close proximity ( within @xmath14 ) to the interface .",
    "the constant @xmath8 , which equals @xmath94 for the hard - core confining potential , can be determined by matching eq .",
    "( [ rate - surface1 ] ) with the corresponding rate for a spherical particle with radius @xmath95 .",
    "a straightforward evaluation of eq .  ( [ rate - surface1 ] ) recovers the standard result for a sphere @xmath96 , while in the recent tdlda calculations for relatively large ( up to @xmath97 nm ) spherical particles @xcite the value @xmath98 was obtained .",
    "note that for systems , whose geometry permits separation of variables , the form ( [ rate - surface1 ] ) of @xmath83 is especially useful since it leads to _ analytical _ results for some common structures that so far eluded attempts of any quantum - mechanical evaluation , as we illustrate below for metal nanorods and nanodisks .",

    "the normalized rates have the same form ( [ rates - spheroid ] ) but with @xmath106 . in fig .  [ fig1 ]",
    ", we show the normalized rates in a prolate spheroid ( @xmath101 ) for both longitudinal ( pl ) and transverse ( pt ) modes as the system shape evolves from a needle to a sphere .",
    "with changing aspect ratio @xmath99 , the rates exhibit a dramatic difference in behavior depending on the local field polarization .",
    "as nanorods become thinner , the normalized rate decreases for the pl mode but increases for the pt modes .",
    "these trends are reversed for nanodisks ( @xmath105 ) , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] : the normalized rates increase for the longitudinal ( ol ) mode and decrease for the transverse ot mode as the nanodisk radius increases ( at fixed height ) .    the dominant factor that determines the surface enhancement of carrier excitation efficiency is the local field polarization relative to the metal - dielectric interface . in a given system , the surface - assisted carrier excitation rate can be manipulated in a wide range by choosing the electric field orientation .",
