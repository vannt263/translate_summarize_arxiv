    "in type - i seesaw mechanism the lightness of the observed neutrinos are attributed to a seesaw scale around the gut scale incorporated in the theory . in this mechanism , right - handed neutrinos @xmath6 incorporated in the seesaw scale",
    "are usually identified with the mass of the @xmath7 : @xmath8 lightest of which is constrained from leptogenesis as @xmath9 gev@xcite .",
    "probing the new physics at such a high scale is far beyond the reach of ongoing collider experiments .",
    "moreover , apart from experimental accessibility , a theoretical analysis based on naturalness for a hierarchical @xmath7 masses @xmath10 put constraints on them as@xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mass of the lightest neutrino . on the other hand , a seesaw scale in the tev range",
    "can be realized in some other variants , such as inverse seesaw , linear seesaw etc . by paying the price in terms of addition of extra singlet neutral fermions into these mechanisms which can explain the smallness of neutrino mass by a small lepton - number breaking mass matrix .",
    "the ingredients of these two models incorporate , in addition to the standard model singlet right - handed neutrinos @xmath13 , a set of singlet fermions @xmath14 , where @xmath15 ( = 1,2,3 ) are the flavour indices .",
    "the yukawa sector of such low energy seesaw mechanism is described by the lagrangian@xcite -_mass = m_d^_r+m^_r_r+m^_l(_l)^c+_s^s_r + + m^s_r+m^s_r+h.c .",
    "=    & &    m_l & m_d & m + m_d^t & m_r & m + m^t & m & _ s    ( _ l)^c + _ r + s_r    + h.c . where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath3 ( since it is due to combination of two different fields ) are the dirac type and the rest are the majorana type mass matrices . usually the linear seesaw mechanism is facilitated with the exclusion of all other lepton number violating mass terms expect ` @xmath3 ' whereas in inverse seesaw mechanism both @xmath2 and @xmath3 contain lepton number violating mass terms .",
    "thus for linear seesaw , we consider diagonal entries @xmath18 and for inverse seesaw , @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , the low energy effective neutrino mass matrix in linear seesaw@xcite can be written as m _ & & -m(m^-1m_d^t)-[m(m^-1m_d^t)]^t and accordingly in inverse seesaw it turns out as m _ & & m_d m^-1_s ( m_d m^-1)^t .",
    "[ inv ] now as there are fewer number of experimental constraints , a fruitful approach is to minimize the number of parameters in the lagrangian .",
    "popular paradigm is to consider some symmetry in the lagrangian that reduces the number of parameters or to assume texture zeros ( which are also dictated by some underlying symmetry ) in the fundamental mass matrices . 0.1 in in our present work we investigate both the low energy seesaw mechanisms mentioned earlier , incorporating the idea of maximal zero textures@xcite subjected to the criterion of non - zero eigenvalues of the charged lepton ( @xmath1 ) and effective neutrino mass matrix ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "we investigate the viable textures of @xmath0 with maximum number of zeros that can be accommodated with the current data .",
    "our methodology is as follows : + i ) first we explore to find out a minimal texture of charged lepton mass matrix ( @xmath1 ) which gives rise to three distinct nonzero eigenvalues , i.e , minimum number of parameters necessary to obtain det(@xmath20)@xmath21 0 .",
    "the textures obtained are such that they do not contribute to @xmath22 .",
    "+ ii ) next we assume all the three light neutrino eigenvalues of @xmath0 are non - zero i.e. , det@xmath23 .",
    "the linear seesaw formula implies that @xmath16 , @xmath3 and @xmath17 are also non - singular",
    ". this fact unambiguously determines the possible minimal textures of @xmath16 , @xmath3 and @xmath17 . in the inverse seesaw",
    ", the same criterion fixes the minimal textures of @xmath16 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "+ iii ) fixing a particular minimal structure of @xmath16 and @xmath17 in linear seesaw ( or @xmath16 and @xmath3 in inverse seesaw ) , we systematically explore to obtain the minimal texture of the matrix @xmath3 ( in linear seesaw ) and @xmath2 in inverse seesaw by putting zeros in different entries , for the case of linear ( inverse ) seesaw .",
    "+ iv ) following , we utilize the frampton and glashow and marfatia condition@xcite to eliminate emerged unphysical effective neutrino matrices ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "+ v ) finally , we explore numerically the parameter space of the survived matrices utilizing the neutrino oscillation global fit data and predict @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath4 along with the hierarchical structure of neutrino masses .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "[ s2 ] contains minimally parametrized charged lepton mass matrices @xmath1 and it is obtained that they do not contribute to @xmath22 .",
    "effective neutrino mass matrices arising from texture zeros in linear seesaw is discussed in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] . the same analysis for inverse seesaw in presented in sec .",
    "[ s5 ] contains the summary of the present work .",
    "in general , the charged lepton mass matrix has the form @xmath27 we look for maximum zero textures ( minimum number of parameters ) of @xmath1 such that @xmath28 ( or non - zero eigenvalues for @xmath1 ) .",

    "non - singular nature of @xmath1 and @xmath0 dictates certain possible textures for the constituent matrices . in the linear seesaw , in our minimalistic approach",
    ", it is seen that 5 is the maximal number of zeros that can be accommodated in matrix ` @xmath3 ' to obtain phenomenologically viable @xmath0 . on the other hand , in the inverse seesaw ,",
    "all the allowed two - zero textures can be explicitly realized in terms of the minimally parametrized constituent matrices .",
    "we have numerically explored the allowed parameter ranges using neutrino oscillation global fit data and predict @xmath45 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath4 along with the hierarchical structure of neutrino masses .",
    "one of the important prediction of this scheme is the vanishingly small value of @xmath4 which could be tested by the ongoing t2k experiment .",
    "all the matrices predict nonvanishing and highly constrained range of @xmath4 along with the normal hierarchical spectrum of neutrino masses .",
    "numerical analyses shows that two - zero textures can not give rise to large cp violation , and therefore if @xmath5 is established , this minimal scheme will be ruled out .",
