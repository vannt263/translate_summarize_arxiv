    "the dynamics of spiral galaxies exhibit a well - documented fine - tuned conspiracy between the surface density of baryonic matter and the total gravitational field @xmath0 @xcite . whatever the explanation for it , this observational fine - tuned relation involves an acceleration scale @xmath1 such that the effects of the putative dark matter appear at @xmath2 and disappear at @xmath3 in galaxies of all sizes .",
    "this is encapsulated by the empirical formula of milgrom @xcite , at the basis of the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) paradigm .    nevertheless , in the central parts of galaxy clusters , where the observed acceleration @xmath4 , the above prescription underpredicts the mass discrepancy by a factor of a few .",
    "putting aside the obvious possibility of this constituting a practical falsification of mond , three other possibilities are that ( i ) there are dark baryons in the central parts of clusters , ( ii ) there is additional non - baryonic dark matter in the central parts of clusters , or ( iii ) milgrom s formula is the limiting case of a more general empirical relation . for",
    "extensive discussions of ( i ) and ( ii ) see , for instance @xcite . here",
    "we rather concentrate on the possibility of case ( iii ) .    a possibility to explain the discrepancy in galaxy clusters is that the effective force law needs a new scale in addition to @xmath5 .",
    "an obvious scale distinguishing galaxy clusters from galaxies is the deepness of the potential well @xmath6 .",
    "for instance , bekenstein @xcite recently proposed in this vein to add a velocity scale to milgrom s prescription , such that the acceleration scale @xmath5 is a function of @xmath6 . in this note",
    ", we explore this very general idea and digress on its observational consequences .",
    "we start by reviewing the mond formalism in sect .  2 , then expose its generalization in sect .  3 .",
    "plausible variations of @xmath5 as a function of @xmath7 and their observational consequences are then explored in sect .",
    "4 and 5 respectively , and conclusions are drawn in sect .",
    "the idea of mond is to link the observed gravitational attraction , @xmath8 , to the newtonian gravitational field calculated from the observed distribution of visible matter , @xmath9 , by means of an interpolating function @xmath10 : @xmath11 where @xmath12 for @xmath13 and @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "however , this expression is not robust since it does not respect usual conservation laws .",
    "a consistent modification of gravity at the classical level should come from modifying the gravitational part of the newtonian lagrangian density @xmath16 .",
    "bekenstein & milgrom @xcite have developed a modified gravity framework where @xmath17 is replaced by @xmath18 , so that the modified lagrangian density reads : @xmath19 where @xmath20 , and @xmath21 can _ a priori _ be any dimensionless function . varying",
    "the action with respect to @xmath7 then leads to a non - linear generalization of the newtonian poisson equation : @xmath22 \\label{bm}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 . in order to recover the right limits for @xmath24",
    ", one needs to choose @xmath25    in the most popular covariant version of the theory @xcite the weak - field potential is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a scalar field whose lagrangian density is proportional to @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a combination of the metric and of a time - like unit vector .",
    "this scalar field lagrangian density is thus fully similar to eq .",
    "[ aqualaction ] , and any modification of the classical mond lagrangian could thus immediately be translated into a modification of the relativistic version of the theory .",
    "[ aqualaction ] and  [ bm ] suggest that the gravitational constant @xmath30 is effectively a running function of the gradient modulus @xmath0 only . in other words ,",
    "the lagrangian of the associated scalar field @xmath27 has no potential and depends only on its kinetic term .",
    "any direct dependency on the field @xmath7 would however be natural , since it is more general and , as we shall see , empirically desirable .    as noted by bekenstein @xcite ,",
    "an obvious distinction between galaxies and galaxy clusters is the deepness of the potential well .",
    "so one could imagine that the effective transition - acceleration @xmath5 is not a constant but is a monotonically increasing function of the potential depth , e.g. , @xmath31 , which boosts the mond effect in galaxy clusters by a factor of a few@xcite .",
    "a side effect of bekenstein s exponentially - varying function is that it predicts a value of @xmath5 of the order of @xmath32 once the potential reaches the order of @xmath33 , i.e. , a neutron star or a stellar black hole would exhibit an undesirable deep - mond behavior ( see fig .  [ figa0 ] ) .",
    "its effect on large scale structures can be severe , too .",
    "it thus seems necessary to study a wider set of models for the effective variation of @xmath5 , and select the best one from a phenomenological point of view .    to extend the mond lagrangian in this vein",
    "a very general way is to write the following lagrangian : @xmath34 where @xmath35 , and @xmath36 plays the role of @xmath5 in the usual mond .",
    "this leads to the following modified poisson equation , generalizing the mond equation ( eq .  [ bm ] ) : @xmath37}_{t_1 } - \\underbrace{\\left|\\frac{\\partial_{\\phi } \\lambda}{8\\pi g}\\right| f_1 \\left(x^2\\right )   } _ { t_2 } \\label{emond}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , which is typically a positive quantity of order unity .",
    "interestingly , with this `` extended mond '' ( emond ) formalism , gauss theorem ( or newton s second theorem ) would no longer be valid in spherical symmetry .",
    "this means that masses outside a sphere can affect the local gravitational field strength , and the empirical eq.[eq : a ] no longer holds rigorously even in spheres , due to the additional term @xmath40 , although this term is often small as we shall see in the next sections .",
    "so we still have approximately the emond counterpart of milgrom s empirical law : @xmath41 masses outside a spherical shell can also affect the local gravitational field strength by changing the boundary value of @xmath7 or the zero - point of the potential @xmath42 , hence changing @xmath43 at the shell .",
    "the appearance of such an absolute zero - point is a curable artifact of our introduction of a non - covariant @xmath44 instead of a covariant @xmath45 .",
    "our lagrangian in eq .",
    "[ lemond ] can be easily redesigned for a covariant scalar field , e.g. , by replacing @xmath46 .",
    "the boundary values of @xmath27 and @xmath45 are then well - defined by the cosmological evolution of @xmath47 .",
    "the zero point of the newtonian potential @xmath48 can raise or lower @xmath7 , but this has no effect on the scale @xmath49 or the acceleration or the light deflection power @xmath50 .",
    "note that we hereafter assume that the covariant version deflects light in a similar fashion as general relativity , by invoking the same vector field as in teves @xcite in addition to the scalar field @xmath27 , where @xmath51 can increase from @xmath5 in galaxies to @xmath52 in clusters and to @xmath53 in black holes for @xmath54 . ]",

    "the only phenomenological requirements would be that ( i ) @xmath43 does not have a too large value in the strong field or cosmology regime , such that general relativity is effectively recovered there , ( ii ) @xmath43 takes roughly the usual value of @xmath5 in galaxies and does not vary too much from galaxy to galaxy or inside a given galaxy , ( iii ) @xmath43 is boosted in galaxy clusters by a reasonable amount compared to the usual value of @xmath5 so to make a real observational difference with mond .",
    "note also that isolated and non - isolated systems should be coherently transitioned from each other .",
    "this means that the potential @xmath7 ( or scalar field @xmath27 ) in @xmath43 should really be the total potential due to all the material .",
    "this reminds of the external field effect ( efe ) of mond @xcite , but is more contriving since the external potentials can be non - neglibible even when the external force is negligible .",
    "so , the fact that one can neglect the weak efe acting on some objects in mond does not mean that one can ignore the external potential effect ( epe ) of emond .",
    "the cosmological value of the scalar field in the covariant version would thus set a cut - off to @xmath45 .",
    "a crude estimate of the epe is to consider that most galaxies and dwarfs are actually within some @xmath70  mpc of a galaxy cluster ( e.g. , virgo is a rich cluster @xmath70  mpc from us ) .",
    "such clusters will typically contribute some @xmath71 to the potential at the boundary of galaxies .",
    "so we can consider that the total @xmath6 is typically always above @xmath72 , which will set @xmath43 close to a lower cut - off with little variation for small internal potentials of small objects .",
    "similarly , @xmath43 is close to an upper cutoff for galaxies residing inside the deep potential of a rich cluster , consistent with the deep - mond like behavior of these cluster galaxies @xcite .    while there are many plausible functional forms of @xmath44 ( see fig .",
    "[ figa0 ] ) , a simple transition can be achieved by a @xmath10-like dependency on the potential without introducing any extra function : @xmath73 with @xmath74 . here",
    "@xmath10 is the same function as whichever @xmath10-function of mond , except that the argument is the potential instead of the acceleration . to be specific we shall use @xmath75 hereafter unless otherwise stated .",
    "this empirical interpolating function simultaneously determines @xmath43 through eq .",
    "[ mulike ] .",
    "the covariant version could take @xmath76 .    with this choice",
    ", all the above requirements on a possible realistic dependency of @xmath43 on the potential are met .",
    "( i ) @xmath77 varies very little for large scale structure , and is almost equal to the observed amplitude of the cosmological constant .",
    "the value of @xmath43 is limited to @xmath78 even for black holes .",
    "( ii ) due to the epe described above , the value of @xmath43 does not go to zero but levels off at @xmath79 , i.e. , the classical value of @xmath5 ( see fig .  [ figa0 ] ) in small galaxies and in the solar system @xcite . additionally , there will be only very mild ( @xmath80 ) variations of @xmath43 inside galaxies , as well as between galaxies , small variations which might be desirable to explain some anomalies in strong lensing galaxies @xcite . in any case",
    "this scatter is acceptable as the mond formula works for all galaxies as long as @xmath5 is within the range between 0.9 and @xmath81 @xcite . as illustrated on fig .",
    "1 ( bottom panel ) , the effective @xmath10-function stays within the range allowed by data on galaxy scales .",
    "( iii ) finally , the much smaller @xmath10 on scales of galaxy clusters ( bottom panel of fig .  [ figa0 ] ) means a boost of mond effect in these ( see also next section ) .    as for the @xmath82 term in eq .",
    "[ emond ] further examinations show that @xmath83 in the deep - mond regime we found @xmath84 for typical forms of @xmath85 and @xmath24 .",
    "so this extra density @xmath82 has a maximum of about @xmath86 times above the cosmic critical density .",
    "such a low over - density is not very significant even at large radii in galaxies , and is mild in galaxy clusters .",
    "in order to illustrate how such an effective gravity law would affect the dynamics of galaxy clusters , we concentrate hereafter on the above @xmath10-like dependency ( eq .  [ mulike ] ) .",
    "there are two basic questions to be answered : ( i ) how much dark matter would be inferred from a newton - einstein framework for a given distribution of baryons ?",
    "( ii ) can this effective  phantom \" dark matter be generically offset from the baryons as observed in weak lensing maps of the large scale structure and in objects such as the bullet cluster @xcite ?    in order to answer both questions , we consider a double peaked oblate potential : @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "we then determine the dynamical density distribution @xmath90 in newtonian interpretation , and we determine the corresponding distribution of baryons in emond with eq .  5 .",
    "the result is plotted on fig .",
    "[ offset ] : the distribution of baryons is typically about 7 times less massive than the dynamical mass inferred from the same potential in newtonian gravity , and interestingly , this distribution of baryons is 4-peaked , with the main baryonic peaks clearly offset from the corresponding peaks in the potential , or newtonian dynamical mass peaks ( see fig .",
    "[ offset ] ) .",
    "it is thus generally possible to create large  phantom \" dark matter peaks generically offset from the baryon distribution within the present gravitational framework .",
    "this could be relevant to the modelling of the dark core in the trainwreck cluster @xcite or to the bullet cluster @xcite , provided that the covariant version deflects light in a similar fashion as general relativity , by e.g. invoking the same vector field as in teves .",
    "we also note that the main baryonic peak seems to be generically in the more outer parts of the system compared to the main gravity peak , which is somewhat more similar to the situation of the train wreck cluster than to the bullet cluster .",

    "the effective gravity law explored in this note is able to boost gravity in galaxy clusters , eliminating the need for additional hot dark matter in mond , a problem that has been known for more than 10 years @xcite . generally speaking ,",
    "the new framework actually needs two interpolating functions , and two fundamental constants defining their transition domains .",
    "the framework is in principle very flexible , and the details of the interpolating functions can be narrowed ( or excluded ) by observational constraints .",
    "it will for instance be important to test which forms can reconcile a large discrepancy in the clusters themselves with a not - too - large discrepancy in the cluster galaxies . here , we recycled the standard @xmath10 function to tailor the @xmath97 function ( eq .  [ mulike ] ) : the result is a transition between two plateaus , @xmath98 for large scale structures and @xmath99 for small galaxies . to make the scheme ( eq .  [ lemond ] ) covariant and valid for lensing is straightforward ( see end of section 3 ) .",
    "future detailed dynamical and lensing studies of galaxies and galaxy clusters should allow one to test whether this  extended mond \" ( emond ) scheme can indeed provide an effective gravity law reproducing mass discrepancies at all scales .",
