    "nonequilibrium stationary systems with stationary currents are widely - used setups to investigate nonequilibrium phenomena in statistical mechanics . stationary systems and stationary currents ( e.g. , heat current , electric current , and matter current ) are ubiquitous from biochemical systems to engineering products .",
    "if two different types of currents flow in a single system , this system can behave as an engine in the following sense : one current flows obeying the conjugate thermodynamic force , and it induces another current flowing against the conjugate thermodynamic force . in the case of the coupling of heat current and electric current , this phenomenon is known as the seebeck effect and the peltier effect .",
    "molecular motors in living systems are also stationary engines which convert chemical potential consumption to mechanical work or particle current .",
    "the framework of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics for stationary systems in the linear response regime is well - established  @xcite . on the basis of this framework ,",
    "stationary engines in the linear response regime are well - studied and their ability is evaluated .",
    "the most important quantity of engines is efficiency , whose maximum is known as the carnot efficiency ( ce ) .",
    "it is established that the general necessary and sufficient condition for stationary engines in the linear response regime to attain the ce is the tight - coupling condition ( i.e. , the determinant of the onsager matrix is zero )  @xcite .",
    "contrary to the case in the linear response regime , general results on stationary engines beyond the linear response regime have been missing .",
    "most studies have analyzed specific elaborated models including feynman s ratchet  @xcite , the brownian motors  @xcite , the sensor - gate model or the autonomous maxwell s demon  @xcite , ideal diodes  @xcite , soft nanomachines  @xcite , and mesoscopic thermoelectric conductors  @xcite , and some of the proposed models attain the ce  @xcite .",
    "however , general properties for stationary engines are only suggested in some papers that a kind of singularity might be important to attain the ce beyond the linear response regime  @xcite .",
    "there are also some attempts to characterize tight - coupling beyond the linear response regime  @xcite , while the connection to the ce has not been revealed .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the condition for stationary engines to attain the ce . by employing the method of partial entropy production  @xcite and the zeroth law of thermodynamics , we derive the necessary condition for general stationary engines to attain the ce .",
    "our derivation follows the spirit in ref .",
    "@xcite , while ours is more sophisticated and covers broader class of stationary engines .",
    "we then clarify the difference between the case of finite - size engines and that of macroscopic engines in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we find that for the case of finite - size engines the condition to attain the ce in the linear response regime ( i.e. , tight - coupling condition in conventional sense ) and that beyond the linear response regime are completely same .",
    "in contrast , for the case of macroscopic engines in the thermodynamic limit , there are three different types of engines which attain the ce .",
    "the first type attains the ce only in the linear response limit , and the second type can always attain the ce regardless of the amount of the chemical potential difference .",
    "the third type can attain the ce with a pair of chemical potentials within a certain definite range .",
    "the second and the third ones employ different types of singularity to realize the ce .",
    "our aforementioned findings are well characterized by the tight - coupling window , which manifests how and what types of tight - coupling appears beyond the linear response regime .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . before going to general discussion , in sec .",
    "[ models ] , we introduce two models of stationary engines which serve respectively as prototypes of finite - size stationary engines and macroscopic stationary engines . these models attain the ce with some choice of parameters , while they do not with some other choice .",
    "the main part of this paper is sec .",
    "[ gen ] , in which we clarify the general necessary and sufficient condition to attain the ce . in sec .",
    "[ pep ] , we explain the method of partial entropy production , and using this , we demonstrate an important property which is satisfied in engines at the ce . with the aid of this properties , in sec .",
    "[ gen - pri ] , we derive the necessary and sufficient condition to attain the ce . in sec .",
    "[ fin ] , we show some consequences of this condition for finite - size engines . in sec .  [ macro ] , we show some consequences of this condition for macroscopic engines . in sec .",
    "[ window ] , we classify these findings by introducing tight - coupling window .    in the most part of this paper , we consider isothermal engines driven by two particle baths with different chemical potentials , since the extension of our results to the case of heat engines driven by two heat baths is straightforward .",
    "we remark that the maximum of the efficiency for such engines ( i.e. , work extraction divided by chemical potential consumption ) is not @xmath0 but 1 , which we also call as the carnot efficiency .",
    "models    before going to general discussion , we first introduce two models of stationary engines , the information engine with switch and the coarse - grained autonomous carnot engine , which are prototypes of finite - size and macroscopic stationary engines , respectively .",
    "we first introduce the information engine with switch ( ies ) , in which a wall suffering mechanical force and particles driven by chemical potential difference are coupled in the form of information .",
    "the ies consists of three parts ; a site , a wall , and a switch , which are attached to a single heat bath with inverse temperature @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "[ f : add - info ] ) .",
    "the site can store at most one particle , where the number of the particle is denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "two particle baths h and l with chemical potentials @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) exchange particles only with this site . the wall places between the site and one of the baths .",
    "the position of the wall is denoted by @xmath6 . if @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , the wall prohibits the jump of particles between the site and the bath h ( l ) .",
    "the switch @xmath9 changes the coefficients of transition rates of the wall .",
    "the state of the whole system is described by @xmath10 .",
    "the transition rates of @xmath11 is set as a constant independent of @xmath12 and @xmath13 : @xmath14 the transition rates of @xmath12 and @xmath13 are set as @xmath15 and @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "the transition rates of the particles satisfy the following detailed - balance condition  @xcite : @xmath18 and those of the wall also satisfy @xmath19 here , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are applied force to the wall , which we in particular set as @xmath22 . in this model , no direct energy exchange between the particles and the wall occurs , and the particle flow and the replacement of the wall affect each other only through the correlation ( information ) between the presence / absence of the particle in the site and the position of the wall .",
    "the switch changes its own state completely random , and it modulates the transition rates as in the following manner : when @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , the wall is likely to change its state if a particle is ( is not ) in the site .",
    "we note that this additional switch is different from the additional variable introduced in ref .",
    "if @xmath25 and @xmath26 is sufficiently small , the particles are transported from the bath h to l and the wall performs work against the external force .    by taking @xmath27 limit and coarse - graining the fast variable @xmath11 , this model reduces to a model known as the sensor - gate model  @xcite or the autonomous maxwell s demon  @xcite . for the case with @xmath28 ,",
    "the reduced system is tight - coupling in conventional sense ( i.e. , the determinant of the onsager matrix is zero ) , and it attains the ce both in and beyond the linear response regime .",
    "in contrast , for the case with @xmath29 , inevitable particle leakage exists and it never attains the ce .",
    "we next introduce the coarse - grained autonomous carnot engine ( cgace )  @xcite , which is an autonomous version of the engine driven by two particle baths with chemical potentials @xmath3 and @xmath4 denoted by h and l ( see fig .  [",
    "f : ac - cycle ] ) .",
    "the engine is in the isothermal condition with inverse temperature @xmath1 the state of the engine denoted by @xmath30 takes four possible states , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , whose volumes are @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the former two states are attached to the bath h , and the latter two states are attached to the bath l. we here define the number of particles divided by @xmath35 as @xmath39 in order to consider the thermodynamic limit @xmath40 finally . the process @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) is associated with the bath h ( l ) , while the processes @xmath43 and @xmath44 conserve the number of particles , which we call closed processes .",
    "the change in states is described by a markov jump process .",
    "we consider the case that the engine tends to move along @xmath45 due to the particle current from the bath h to l , and we extract the work by imposing external force in the direction @xmath46 . we here suppose that the two closed processes are slow processes and the probability distribution for states with @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) is given by the grand canonical distribution with @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "we define @xmath47 as the energy difference from @xmath31 to @xmath32 including the external force , and @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 are defined in a similar manner . with noting that the total change in potential energy is zero through a cyclic process",
    ", the work done by the engine against the external force through a single rotation @xmath45 is expressed as @xmath51 the isothermal condition of the engine implies that the transition rates of @xmath44 and @xmath43 denoted by @xmath52 satisfy the following detailed - balance condition : @xmath53 where the superscript @xmath54 represents the state of its opposite side : @xmath55 , and @xmath56 is the helmholtz free energy .",
    "we defined normalized energy and the ratio of @xmath35 to @xmath57 as @xmath58 the extensive property of the free energy implies @xmath59 .",
    "we now consider the situation of large @xmath35 .",
    "the stationary distribution of probability density with respect to @xmath39 is calculated as @xmath60 where @xmath61 represents the stationary probability at @xmath31 or @xmath32 , and @xmath62 is a normalization constant ensuring @xmath63=1.\\ ] ] we define @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 in a similar manner .",
    "the stationary probability flow of @xmath67 with @xmath39 is given by @xmath68 the law of large numbers suggests that the realized number of particles under the condition that the transition @xmath67 occurs is around the most provable value @xmath69 as will be discussed in the appendix .",
    "[ detail - cgace ] , the cgace does not attain the ce with nonsingular setups , while it attains the ce with some singular setups .",
    "gen      pep    before going to the derivation of the necessary and sufficient condition for stationary engines to attain the ce , we first explain the method of partial entropy production and its implication , which is first shown in ref .",
    "consider a markov jump process on discrete states .",
    "let @xmath70 and @xmath71 be the probability distribution of @xmath72 and the transition rate from @xmath72 to @xmath73 .",
    "we then define the dual transition rate @xmath74 as satisfying @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the energy and the number of particles of the state @xmath72 . the right - hand side of eq .",
    "is equal to the thermodynamic force on the transition @xmath78 . the entropy production of the total system",
    "is then given by  @xcite @xmath79 precisely speaking , this quantity is not entropy production but entropy production rate , but we also call this quantity as entropy production in case of no confusion .",
    "we now introduce a key quantity : the ( averaged ) partial entropy production with a transition @xmath78 as @xmath80 which is a decomposition of the entropy production into each transition : @xmath81    the nonnegativity of the partial entropy production is confirmed by a simple mathematical inequality : @xmath82 an important consequence of this fact is that zero entropy production ( @xmath83 ) leads to zero partial entropy production for all transitions ( @xmath84 for all @xmath78 ) .",
    "in addition , the equality of the above inequality holds if and only if @xmath85 . since @xmath86 and @xmath87 for the case of the partial entropy production , we find that zero partial entropy production @xmath84 implies @xmath88 which means that the rate of probability distribution between @xmath72 and @xmath73 is equal to corresponding equilibrium distribution .",
    "the aforementioned discussion is summarized as follows : zero entropy production is equivalent to zero partial entropy production for any transition @xmath78 , which directly implies that the rate of probability distributions with @xmath72 and @xmath73 is equal to corresponding equilibrium distribution .",
    "gen - pri    we now derive the necessary and sufficient condition for stationary engines to attain the ce .",
    "we denote the state of the whole system by @xmath89 ( or @xmath90 for the case in the thermodynamic limit ) , where @xmath30 represents the state of the engine and @xmath13 represents the number of particles ( @xmath39 represents the number of particles divided by a typical volume @xmath91 ) . for the case of engines driven by two heat baths , the state of the whole system is denoted by @xmath92 with the energy @xmath93 . in the following , we consider a stationary engine at the ce and clarify the conditions this engine should satisfy .",
    "we first ensure that an engine never attains the ce if there exist two states @xmath89 and @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) such that the bath h induces a transition @xmath96 and the bath l induces another transition @xmath96  @xcite , which we call _ bath separation condition_. we shall explain why this condition is required . as seen in the previous subsection , the entropy production goes to zero only when the local distribution is equilibrium one .",
    "however , two transition paths with different chemical potentials never satisfy the equilibrium condition simultaneously , which implies finite entropy production and less efficiency than the ce .",
    "the bath separation condition implies that the engine is attached to at most a single particle bath at one moment .",
    "we thus decompose the states of the engine @xmath97 into those attached to the bath h expressed as @xmath98 and the bath l as @xmath99 . in the case of the ies ,",
    "the engine takes four possible states @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 , which are decomposed into @xmath104 and @xmath105 . in the case of the cgace ,",
    "the engine takes four possible states @xmath106 , which are decomposed into @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "we suppose that the energy difference of the engine between two states ( e.g. , @xmath109 in the cgace ) is independent of @xmath13 .",
    "two models introduced in the previous section satisfy this condition . if a model does not satisfy this condition , we modify the model by adding a new parameter to satisfy this condition ( details are discussed in the appendix .  [ add - para ] ) .",
    "this setup ensures that the round trip between @xmath30 and @xmath110 does not contribute to the amount of work extraction .    employing the result in the previous subsection again",
    ", we further obtain that the stationary distribution of @xmath13 with the state of the engine @xmath30 satisfies @xmath111 if the engine is at the ce .",
    "we call this condition as _ equilibration condition _  @xcite .",
    "we now focus on a transition @xmath112 . using the bath separation condition and equilibration condition , the average number of particles transported from @xmath113 to @xmath114 under the condition that the transition from @xmath113 to @xmath114 occurs is calculated as @xmath115 where @xmath116 is defined as @xmath117 we next calculate @xmath118 . to calculate this ,",
    "let us consider imaginary situation that the chemical potential of the bath l is not @xmath4 but @xmath3 and whole system is in equilibrium ( see fig .  [ f : imaginary ] ) .",
    "we express quantities in this imaginary setup by labeling the superscript  i m \" .",
    "the zeroth law of thermodynamics claims that there is no particle current between @xmath113 and @xmath114 : @xmath119 in addition , since the distribution of particles in @xmath114 is same in the imaginary setup and in the actual stationary engine , we find @xmath120 combining them , we arrive at the expression of @xmath118 in terms of @xmath116 as @xmath121 where we defined @xmath122 .    the necessary condition for absence of particle leakage ( i.e. , finite entropy production ) between @xmath114 and @xmath113",
    "is expressed as @xmath123 for finite - size engines and @xmath124 for engines in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we here used the fact that an engine at the ce has zero power  @xcite , and thus the probability flow with @xmath125 and that with @xmath112 are balanced .",
    "in contrast , by defining @xmath126 we obtain @xmath127 in the fifth line , we use the fact that the numerator in the fourth line is the variance of @xmath13 with respect to @xmath128 . recalling the condition of zero entropy production , we find that two inequalities in eq .   should be equality .",
    "we first analyze the second inequality .",
    "for the case with finite @xmath129 , the second inequality becomes equality if and only if @xmath130 .",
    "for the case with linear response regime ( @xmath131 ) , we take another approach .",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation relation  @xcite suggests that the tight - coupling condition is equivalent to @xmath132 , where we denoted by @xmath133 and @xmath134 the particle current and another current corresponding to work extraction , respectively .",
    "if @xmath116 has finite fluctuation , this fluctuation can induce finite particle current @xmath133 without inducing another current @xmath134 , which violates the above tight - coupling condition .",
    "hence , @xmath135 holds if and only if @xmath130 both in and beyond the linear response regime .",
    "we next consider the first inequality . under the above condition of @xmath116 , the first inequality becomes equality only when the peak of @xmath136 is also at the same @xmath137 .",
    "our findings are summarized as follows .",
    "a stationary engine attains the ce only when @xmath116 has delta - function - type singularity such that : @xmath138 for finite - size engines and @xmath139 for engines in the thermodynamic limit . here , @xmath140 represents the probability of the number of particles when the transition @xmath141 occurs , and @xmath142 represents the probability density with respect to @xmath39 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath91 in eqs .   and appears in order to translate the transition rate with @xmath143 to the transition rate density with @xmath39 .",
    "it is easy to check that the above conditions are also sufficient for stationary engines to attain the ce .",
    "the equations , ( or , ) require two conditions :    1 .",
    "the probability @xmath140 ( @xmath144 ) is a delta - function with respect to @xmath13 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the two delta - functions have peaks at the same @xmath137 ( @xmath145 ) .    to attain the ce",
    ", these two conditions should be satisfied for any transition between a state with h and that with l. in the remainder of this paper , we treat only a single transition , and we say that the engine attains the ce if the analyzed transition satisfies the above two conditions",
    ".      fin    a finite - size engine does not generally satisfy the condition ( 1 ) .",
    "by contrast , the condition ( 1 ) accompanies the condition ( 2 ) because the presence of a transition ensures the existence of its opposite transition .",
    "thus , the nontrivial question is what types of engines satisfy the condition ( 1 ) . to realize the condition ( 1 ) in finite - size engines",
    ", the transition rate with @xmath125 should be in the following form : it takes a nonzero value only with a particular @xmath13 , that is , @xmath146 for all @xmath147 except @xmath148 .",
    "in this setup , the particle current and the work current ( or another particle current ) are rigidly coupled and particle leakage is intrinsically prohibited .",
    "otherwise , particle leakage inevitably exists , which prohibits the ce .",
    "we remark that this condition is same for both cases in and beyond the linear response regime .",
    "an important consequence of this finding is that if an engine is tight - coupling in the linear response regime , the engine always attains the ce beyond the linear response regime .    to clarify these findings ,",
    "let us take the ies as an example .",
    "the case with @xmath28 corresponds to the tight - coupling condition , and in this case the ies always attains the ce with any @xmath3 and @xmath4 even beyond the linear response regime by tuning @xmath149 . in contrast , the ies with @xmath29 never attains the ce even in the @xmath131 limit . in this case , there exists a cyclic path @xmath150 , which transports a particle from the bath h to l without extracting work ( see fig .",
    "[ f : finite ] ) .",
    "this particle leakage prevents the ies to attain the ce even in the linear response regime",
    ".      macro    the situation is completely different for the case of a macroscopic engine in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "if the bath separation condition and equilibration condition are satisfied , the condition ( 1 ) is always satisfied due to the law of large numbers .",
    "however , the condition ( 2 ) is not satisfied in general .",
    "thus , the nontrivial question is what types of engines satisfy the condition ( 2 ) .",
    "using the helmholtz free energy @xmath56 and defining @xmath151 with a typical volume of the engine @xmath91 , we define a function @xmath152 as @xmath153 the probability density of @xmath39 under the condition of @xmath125 is expressed in terms of @xmath152 as @xmath154 here , if @xmath155 has discontinuity at @xmath156 , we suppose that @xmath155 can take any value between @xmath157 and @xmath158 . due to the law of large numbers",
    ", they have a delta - function type peak at @xmath159 and @xmath160 , which are solutions of @xmath161 we note that the second law of thermodynamics requires monotonic increase of @xmath162 with respect to @xmath39 , which confirms that the above equations have unique solutions .",
    "we draw many properties from these relations . first ,",
    "in the linear response limit @xmath163 , the condition ( 2 ) , @xmath164 , is always satisfied .",
    "a simple example is demonstrated in appendix .",
    "[ upper - cgace ] . thus , if the bath separation condition and equilibration condition are satisfied , a macroscopic engine always attains the ce in the limit of @xmath165",
    ". one may feel that this result looks contradicting to experimental observations on macroscopic thermoelectric devices , where maximum efficiency is usually less than the ce .",
    "however , our result and these observations are in fact consistent because general macroscopic thermoelectric devices do not satisfy the bath separation condition and equilibration condition in general .",
    "second , beyond the linear response regime @xmath166 , the condition @xmath167 reads @xmath168 these conditions are fulfilled in two cases . in the first case , the engine has a discontinuous delta - function type transition rate .",
    "we have already seen this idea for finite - size engines . in this case",
    ", @xmath155 formally takes any real number at @xmath169 , and the engine always attains the ce regardless of the amount of chemical potential difference . in the second case",
    ", the engine has a continuous but indifferentiable transition rate or free energy whose derivative jumps at @xmath170 . in this case , @xmath171 has discontinuity , and an engine with two chemical potentials both of which are in this discontinuous interval always attains the ce .",
    "the cgace clearly illustrates how the second case is realized and how the engine fails to attain the ce without such singularities ( see appendix .  [ detail - cgace ] ) .",
    "window    to elucidate the difference of these various ways to achieve @xmath164 , we introduce the idea of _ tight - coupling window_. let @xmath172 and @xmath173 be given chemical potentials of two particle baths , and suppose that we can tune other parameters ( e.g. , external force , another pair of chemical potentials ) to attain the ce .",
    "we draw the @xmath174 coordinate and plot pairs @xmath175 with which the ce is attainable ( see fig .  [",
    "f : window ] ) .",
    "we call a rectangular plotted on the coordinate as _ window_.    our analyses in the previous sections suggest the possibility of three types of window :    * infinitesimal window : the plotted region is only on @xmath176 and there is no window with finite width .",
    "* finite window : a square with a edge from @xmath177 to @xmath178 is plotted .",
    "* infinite window : the whole space of the coordinate is plotted .",
    "engines with the infinitesimal window attain the ce only in the linear response limit ( @xmath165 ) , and those with other two windows attain the ce even beyond the linear response regime .",
    "our analyses discover that a finite - size engine has the infinite window or no window ( i.e. , the engine never attains the ce even in the linear response limit ) , while an engine in the thermodynamic limit may have all types of window .",
    "a delta - function - type transition rate accompanies the infinite window .",
    "in contrast , a continuous but indifferentiable transition rate or free energy accompanies the finite window .",
    "the infinitesimal window is seen in general macroscopic engines with the bath separation condition and equilibration condition .",
    "this viewpoint serves as a clear understanding of the connection between tight - coupling in the linear response regime and properties in the nonlinear regime .",
    "it also characterizes the notion of tight - coupling beyond the linear response regime .",
    "we remark that our characterization of macroscopic engines is on the foundation of microscopic understanding on transition rates .",
    "this is similar to the case of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , which connects the onsager matrix and equilibrium fluctuation through microscopic analyses  @xcite .",

    ", the attainment of the ce in the linear response regime directly leads to the attainment with any chemical potential differences .",
    "in contrast , for macroscopic engines , there are three types of mechanisms to attain the ce , whose characteristics are elucidated by the tight - coupling window .",
    "as long as satisfying the bath separation condition and equilibration condition , a macroscopic stationary engine attains the ce in the linear response limit . to attain the ce beyond the linear response regime",
