    "by now , the physics of spin phenomena has become an essential component of the research program at many large accelerators of new generation [ 1 - 5 ] .",
    "this is a consequence of , first , the successful development of the polarization technique , in particular , methods of obtaining polarized beams and advances in the construction of polarized targets and polarimeters [ 3 ] .",
    "second , the electroweak interactions play an important role in the energy range of the current accelerators .",
    "they violate both @xmath6 and @xmath7 parity [ 6,7 ] , and also combined @xmath8 invariance [ 8 ] .",
    "this violation manifests itself in polarization effects , which are often used as precision tests of the standard model with accuracy unattainable in other experiments [ 1,5 ] .",
    "third , it is necessary to go beyond the standard model to seek new particles and new types of interactions , and here spin can play a very important role .",
    "the advances in accelerator and polarization techniques have revealed new possibilities in the study of polarized particle interaction processes .",
    "therefore , it is becoming more and more important to calculate theoretically the probabilities for various elementary - particle interaction processes , taking into account the particle polarizations and internal structure , and also to develop new computational tools . when the standard approach [ 9 - 12 ] is used to calculate the probabilities for various processes ( i.e. , to calculate the squared moduli of matrix elements ) , the inclusion of the particle polarizations greatly complicates both the calculations themselves and the structure of the expressions obtained .",
    "their covariance is often lost .",
    "a natural way to simplify the calculations for reactions involving polarized particles is to calculate not the squared moduli of matrix elements , but instead the matrix elements themselves .",
    "this can be done in several different ways [ 13 ] .",
    "one way is to use the explicit form of the fundamental matrices and state functions written in a particular basis of the representation space of the lorentz group in which they are defined .",
    "a noncovariant approach of this type has already been used for spin-1/2 particles by powell [ 14 ] in 1949 .",
    "the general theoretical development of this method is due to sokolov [ 15 ] .",
    "this method continues to be used successfully to this day [ 16,17 ] , owing to the appearance of powerful computer programs for analytic calculations .",
    "however , the most widely used method for calculating the matrix elements of qed processes is the covariant method not involving the use of the explicit matrices and wave functions .",
    "it was proposed in 1961 independently by bellomo [ 18 ] and by bogush and fedorov [ 19 ] .",
    "this approach is based on the method of projection operators in elementary - particle theory developed by fedorov [ 20 ] .",
    "the bellomo method uses a trick which amounts to multiplying the matrix elements @xmath9 of the transition from the initial state ( @xmath10 ) to the final state ( @xmath11 ) , where @xmath12 is the interaction operator , by the quantity @xmath13 , so that the amplitude @xmath14 can be reduced to calculation of a trace : ] @xmath15 @xmath16 here @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the projection matrixs - diadics of the initial and final states [ 20 ] : @xmath19 .",
    "the operator @xmath20 in ( 2 ) is arbitrary . in ref .",
    "18 it was chosen to be : @xmath21 . in recent years",
    ", the greatest progress in the development of the bellomo method ( in the ultrarelativistic , massless case ) has been made by the calcul group [ 21 ] .",
    "the achievements of this group are widely recognized and extensively used by scientists all over the world .",
    "the calcul method has been generalized to fermions with nonzero mass in refs .",
    "22 and 23 , but this generalization requires the introduction of additional vectors unrelated to the kinematics of the process under study , making it inconvenient to use .    in the method proposed in ref .",
    "19 , the operator @xmath22 is constructed on the basis of a complex vector parametrization of the lorentz group [ 24 - 26 ] and the operators @xmath23 of representations of this group in the space of particle wave functions [ 27,28 ] , which play the role of operators for transitions from the initial to the final state : @xmath24 . here",
    "the operator @xmath25 is written as [ 13,19 ] : @xmath26 this version was originally developed for longitudinally polarized dirac particles [ 29 ] .",
    "it was developed further by fedorov [ 30 - 32 ] and his students ( see ref . 13 and references therein ) . in principle , the method developed by fedorov ( ref .",
    "36 ) allows analytic expressions to be obtained for the matrix elements of various qed processes for arbitrarily polarized dirac particles , either massive or massless , which is the main , decisive advantage of this method over that of the calcul group .",
    "however , the striving for generality is not always consistent with efficiency of the approach .    for a number of qed problems , the development of the approach of refs .",
    "13 and 19 for calculating matrix elements of multiparticle processes is largely the result of progress in developing covariant methods of describing the spin properties of two - particle systems based on the use of a vector parametrization of the lorentz little groups [ 13,37 ] .    at the present time",
    ", the helicity basis introduced by jacob and wick [ 33 ] is very popular in high - energy physics .",
    "this is a consequence of the simplicity of the physical interpretation of helicity ( the spin projection on the direction of the particle momentum ) , the fact that the center of mass of the system is distinguished in the helicity basis , and also the fact that the helicity amplitudes admit a simple partial - wave analysis using the @xmath27 group [ 33 ] .",
    "in addition , studying the helicities of moving particles is analogous to studying the spins of particles at rest [ 13 ] .",
    "however , there are several important factors which prevent helicity from playing the dominant role in describing the spin projection of particles .",
    "one is that the helicity is not a particle characteristic which is invariant under lorentz transformation [ 9,13 ] .",
    "nevertheless , in the literature one can find articles with titles like `` a covariant method for calculating helicity amplitudes '' ( ref .",
    "34 ) . in interpreting the dynamics of the spin interaction ,",
    "amplitudes with and without change of the particle helicity are often referred to as amplitudes with and without spin flip .",
    "however , since the particle momentum is changed by the interaction , it is clear that such a classification is very arbitrary .",
    "both types of amplitude actually describe a process with a change in the particle spin state .    many of these difficulties can be avoided for a particular choice of spin basis of a reaction , namely , the diagonal spin basis ( dsb ) , in which the spin 4-vectors @xmath28 and @xmath29 of particles with 4-momenta @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) belong to the hyperplane formed by the 4-vectors @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( refs .",
    "35 and 36 ) : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the spin vectors ( 4 ) obviously do not change under transformations of the lorentz little group common to particles with 4-momenta @xmath30 and @xmath31 [ 37 ] : @xmath36 .",
    "we note that it will be a one - parameter subgroup of the rotation group with axis whose direction is determined by the vector [ 13,37 ] : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is an arbitrary real number .",
    "the direction of @xmath39 ( 5 ) possesses the property that the projections of the spins of both particles on it will have definite values even when the particles have different masses .",
    "therefore , the dsb naturally makes it possible to describe the spin states of systems of any two particles ( including ones with different masses ) by means of the spin projections on the single common direction given by the vector ( 5 ) .    the fundamental fact that the lorentz little group common to particles with momenta @xmath30 and @xmath31",
    "is realized in the dsb leads to a number of remarkable consequences [ 35 - 42 ] .",
    "first , in this basis particles with 4-momenta @xmath30 ( before the interaction ) and @xmath31 ( after the interaction ) have the same spin operators [ 38 - 40 ] , which allows the covariant separation of the interactions with and without change of the spin states of the particles involving in the reaction , making it possible to trace the dynamics of the spin interaction .",
    "second , in the dsb ( 4 ) the mathematical structure of the amplitudes is maximally simplified , owing to the coincidence of the particle spin operators , the separation of wigner rotations from the amplitudes [ 35,36 ] , and the decrease in the number of various scalar products of 4-vectors which characterize the reaction .",
    "third , in the dsb the spin states of massless particless ( @xmath40 ) coincide up to a sign with the helicity states [ 40 - 42 ] .",
    "use of the dsb does not lead to loss of generality , because the transformation to an arbitrary spin basis is carried out by means of wigner @xmath41 functions [ 43 ] . in the new expressions for the amplitudes , the original amplitudes give the best representation of the dynamics of spin phenomena , and the @xmath41 functions are purely kinematical in nature .",
    "therefore , the dsb reveals new possibilities for developing methods to calculate matrix elements and increasing the efficiency of such methods when the bogush - fedorov approach is used [ 13,19 ] .",
    "the first calculation of matrix elements in the dsb was performed in refs .",
    "35 and 36 , using the spinor formalism .",
    "the amplitudes were calculated for the complete set of dirac matrices @xmath42 in which the arbitrary operator @xmath12 entering into ( 1 ) is expanded .",
    "we also note that the methods proposed in refs .",

    "we shall use the following approaches in describing the spin properties of particles : ( a ) the approach proposed by bargmann and wigner , in which the spin - projection operators are determined by using the generators of the lorentz little groups .",
    "these are known in the literature as the pauli - bargmann - lyubanskii operators [ 43,45 ] .",
    "( b ) the covariant spin theory developed by fedorov on the basis of vector parametrization of the lorentz little groups and their representations [ 13 ] .",
    "these approaches are essentially equivalent . however , vector parametrization of the lorentz group not only allows simplification of the theory of the spin properties of elementary particles , but also disposes of ( see ref . 13 )",
    "commonly encountered , incorrect statements about some approaches [ 9,10 ] , such as `` for a given momentum the spin projection on an arbitrary axis can not have a definite value '' .",
    "we shall start from the fact that in momentum space the free state of a particle with 4-momentum @xmath79 and spin projection @xmath80 on the @xmath81 axis is described by the state vector @xmath82 ( we drop the indices denoting the spin @xmath83 , the mass @xmath84 , and other particle characteristics ) .",
    "the particle spin @xmath83 is defined as the angular momentum in the rest frame , where the orbital angular momentum is zero .",
    "it is therefore convenient to define the state vector @xmath82 in terms of the state vector in the rest frame @xmath85 , where @xmath86 .",

    "let @xmath89 be a boost , i.e. , a lorentz transformation such that @xmath90 , @xmath91 , where @xmath92 then @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the operator for this transformation acting in the space of state vectors .",
    "the state vector @xmath82 satisfies the equations : @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97 here @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the energy - momentum and spin - projection operators : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the pauli - lyubanskii 4-vector [ 43 ] : @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the angular - momentum operators . using ( 4 ) , ( 1.6 ) , and ( 1.7 ) , we find that the spin - projection operators for the initial and final particles @xmath104 and @xmath105 in the dsb ( 4 ) coincide and have the form [ 38,39 ] : @xmath106 it should be noted that in any other basis different from the diagonal one , the operators @xmath107 and @xmath108 do not coincide and , therefore , do not commute with each other .",
    "the requirement that the lorentz little groups coincide for particles with momenta @xmath30 and @xmath31 imposes rigorous constraints not only on the choice of particle spin vectors @xmath28 and @xmath29 , but also on the spin - projection axes @xmath109 and @xmath110 ( see ( 1.1 ) ) . as was shown in refs .",

    "we shall start from the following initial .",
    "we take a head - on collision to be one in which the electrons have energy @xmath841 and @xmath842 gev , and @xmath843 ev ( a neodymium laser ) .",
    "we shall use the expansions ( 8.13)-(8.15 ) for numerical calculations of the energy spectra @xmath844 ( where @xmath845 is the total emission probability ) and the degree of circular polarization @xmath807 of an emitted photon for @xmath760 . for @xmath761 we shall use the exact expressions ( 8.16 ) and ( 8.17 ) . in this case",
    "@xmath846 is determined from the conditions for the series ( 8.16 ) to converge .",
    "the results of numerical calculations of the energy spectra for various polarizations of the initial electrons ( @xmath847 ) and laser photon ( @xmath330 ) are shown by the graphs in figs .",
    "3a , 3b , and 3c for @xmath848 , and @xmath849 , respectively .",
    "we see from these figures that the inclusion of nonlinear effects leads to a significant difference between the calculated spectra and the spectra of ordinary compton scattering .",
    "first , the simultaneous absorption of several photons from the wave leads to broadering of the hard-@xmath468 spectrum and the appearance of additional peaks corresponding to the emission of higher - order harmonics . for a given electron energy",
    "this broadering is larger , the larger the wave intensity .",
    "for example , for @xmath841 gev and @xmath850 the spectrum is bounded above by the value @xmath851 , while for @xmath852 it practically vanishes at @xmath853 , even though an insignificant fraction of the photons can carry off up to 97% of the electron energy .",
    "second , the effective increase of the electron mass [ 85 ] @xmath854 leads to compression of the spectra at smaller values of @xmath827 , because for each @xmath789 the spectrum is bounded above by the value @xmath855 and not by @xmath856 .",
    "the increase of the electron energy decreases the relative compression of the first harmonic ( see fig . 3a ) . for relatively low intensity of the laser wave ( @xmath850 )",
    "the main contribution to the emission comes from photons of the first harmonic , and the yield of photons from higher harmonics is insignificant . at intermediate intensity ( @xmath852 )",
    "the broadering of the spectrum due to nonlinear effects is accompanied by an increase of the probability , and the yield of harder photons becomes important . finally , at high intensities ( @xmath857 ) , as seen from fig .",
    "3c , emission owing to nonlinear multiphoton absorption processes becomes comparable to one - photon emission and even begins to dominate ( at @xmath841 gev ) .",
    "therefore , emission of the first harmonic dominates in the cbs spectra in the field of a circularly polarized electromagnetic wave at @xmath850 , while at @xmath858 the emission in mainly due to higher harmonics , i.e. , the emission of a hard photon by an electron essentially becomes nonlinear [ 86 ] .",
    "= 0.4 = 0.4 = 0.4    to study the polarization effects at each value of the energy @xmath823 , we calculated the energy spectra for the following polarization states of the electron and laser photon : @xmath859 these correspond to lines 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively , in fig .",
    "everything said above about the behavior of the energy spectra pertained to these three lines .",
    "regarding their relative location , from fig .",
    "3 we see that the most intense spectra correspond to the case where the electron and laser photon spins are parallel ( @xmath860 ) , while the least intense ones correspond to antiparallel spins ( @xmath861 ) , as in the case of ordinary compton back - scattering ( see ref .",
    "we also note that the difference between the spectra calculated for the three polarization cases considered is very large at small values of the intensity parameter ( @xmath850 ) , but insignificant at @xmath862 gev ) .",

    "for this we first note that the above - mentioned kinematical features of the behavior of the amplitudes @xmath864 in ( 8.7 ) and ( 8.8 ) has a spin origin [ 86 ] .",
    "in fact , the equation @xmath796 correspond to photon emission in the direction of motion of the initial electron beam . in the case of absorption of @xmath789 photons ( @xmath865 ) from the wave and exact backward scattering of the hard photon , the total helicity of the @xmath866 and @xmath867 system before and after the interaction is not conserved .",
    "it is this which causes all the amplitudes @xmath868 for @xmath869 and also @xmath870)to vanish .",
    "the requirement of helicity conservation also leads to @xmath871 for ordinary compton scattering at the edge of the spectrum [ 86 ] .    as can be seen from figs .",
    "4 and 5 , the inclusion of nonlinear effects ( @xmath831 ) decreases the degree of circular polarization at the first peak .",
    "the contribution of higher harmonics leads to the appearance of additional peaks , and at the edge of the spectrum ( for @xmath872 ) we have @xmath873 , as in the case of ordinary scattering .",
    "however , it should be noted that the yield of these photons is insignificant , since the spectra are practically broken off at @xmath874 .",
    "the situation regarding @xmath875 is the most favorable in this respect , as there is a large range of hard @xmath468 energies in which the degree of circular polarization @xmath876 is very close to unity .",
    "84 it was shown that a hard photon obtained in the reaction ( 8.1 ) can create @xmath2 pairs in a collision with photons of the same laser beam .",

    "the lowest energy of the compton photon ( @xmath877 ) in the process ( 8.2 ) for a neodymium laser with @xmath878 ev is @xmath879 gev .",

    "it is easily checked that the inclusion of the influence of the nonlinear effects in ( 8.1 ) on the process ( 8.2 ) also leads to a significant lowering of the @xmath2-pair production threshold and to an increase in the number of pairs [ 90 ] .",

    "the goal of the present review was to explain what the dsb is , what new contribution it makes to the description of particle spin properties and also to the development of the covariant method to calculate matrix elements in the bogush - fedorov approach , and how this method is related to others like that of the calcul group .",
    "we have seen that the dsb plays a key role among all the other methods in that in it the loretz little group common to particles with 4-momenta @xmath50 ( before the interaction ) and @xmath929 ( after the interaction ) is realized .",
    "the dsb allows the description of the spin states of systems consisting of two particles ( even when they have different masses ) by means of the spin projections on a single common direction .",
    "the coincidence of the loretz little groups causes the particles before and after the interaction to have a common set of spin operators which commute with each other , and this allows the covariant separation of the interactions with and without change of the spin states of the particles involved in the reaction , so that the dynamics of the spin interaction can be traced .",
    "thanks to the coincidence of the spin operators and also the fact that wigner rotations are singled out , the mathematical structure of the diagonal amplitudes is maximally simplified .    to calculate matrix elements in the covariant bogush - fedorov approach ,",
    "it is necessary to know the projection operators of the particle states , the operator for the transition from the initial to the final state ( and its inverse ) , and also the raising and lowering spin operators in the case of spin flip transitions . in the review",
    "we have developed this covariant approach by using the dsb .",
    "we have constructed the operators @xmath930 used to calculate the diagonal amplitudes in the case of transitions without and with spin flip .",
    "they are valid in both the massive and the massless cases .",
    "we have obtained three equivalent representations for them which have a compact form .",
    "we have also studied the transition to the massless case , in which the dsb coincides up to a sign with the helicity basis .    in the calcul method",
    "the fermion must be massless .",
    "the key feature of that method is the very convenient choice of photon polarization vectors , in which the momenta of the fermions from which the photons are emitted are used .",
    "this ensures gauge invariance and simplifies the structure of the amplitudes , so that they can ultimately be calculated . in the calcul method",
    "the mass can be taken into account only in the ultrarelativistic case and only in the form of awkward mass corrections . as a rule , generalizations of this method to the massive case",
    "require the introduction of auxiliary vectors unrelated to the kinematics of the problem , which are therefore inconvenient to work with .",
    "nevertheless , this method contains the attractive idea of constructing the photon polarization vectors in terms of the 4-momenta of the particles participating in the reaction .",
    "this allows a decrease in the number of various scalar products in the final expressions for the amplitudes and thereby simplifies the calculations .",
    "therefore , giving up on the generality of the treatment makes the solution of the problem more efficient .",
    "this is even more true with regard to the method developed for calculating diagonal amplitudes , because the construction of the mathematical formalism for them involves only the 4-momenta of the particles participating in the reaction . in the dsb",
    "this is sufficient , thanks to the use of the ideas of the covariant bogush - fedorov approach .",
    "let us briefly list the main results of our calculations of several specific qed processes using the method developed for calculating matrix elements in the dsb .",
    "we have shown that in the ultrarelativistic ( massless ) limit , the differential cross sections for mller and bhabha bremsstrahlung ( @xmath931 ) in the case where not only the initial @xmath325 and @xmath408 , but also the photon are helically polarized can be presented as the product of two factors , one of which is universal and coincides with that obtained earlier by the calcul group when polarization is absent .",
    "the helicity amplitudes of the three - photon annihilation of a free pair @xmath932 have been calculated along with the orthopositronium annihilation amplitudes corresponding to total spin projection @xmath933 .",
    "the differential cross sections taking into account the polarizations of the various particles were obtained .",
    "the annihilation probability was calculated in the case where one @xmath468 is linearly polarized and the other two are unpolarized .",
    "the expression obtained for the degree of photon linear polarization coincides with the results of other authors .",
    "a compact expression was obtained for the differential cross section of the bethe - heitler emission of a linearly polarized photon by an electron , taking into account the proton recoil and form factors , thanks to the factorization of the squared electric and magnetic form factors of the proton . in the limit where the proton is a point particle of infinite mass ,",
    "this expression becomes the usual one .",
    "we have studied the reaction @xmath610 , taking into account the proton polarizability in the kinematics corresponding to electron scattering at small angles and photon scattering at fairly large angles , where proton bremsstrahlung dominates .",
    "the results of numerical calculations performed in the rest frame of the initial proton at electron beam energy @xmath934 mev in the chosen kinematics show that the conditions needed to isolate the subprocess @xmath935 from the reaction @xmath465 are satisfied , because the relative contribution of the bethe - heitler and interference terms to the reaction cross section is less than 10 % , and the cross section for the reaction @xmath465 is quite sensitive to the proton polarizability .",
    "a covariant expression has been obtained for the lepton tensor in which the contribution of states with transverse and longitudinal polarization of the virtual photon is isolated .",
    "it has been shown that inclusion of the lepton mass tends to increase the degree of linear polarization of the virtual photon .",
    "we have studied nonlinear effects in compton back - scattering of photons by an intense circularly polarized laser wave focused on a beam of longitudinally polarized ultrarelativistic electrons ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "we have found that at high intensities the emission of a hard photon is essentially nonlinear , and the effect of the polarizations is markedly diminished .",
    "we have shown that the broadering of the spectrum in nonlinear compton back - scattering tends to lower the @xmath362-pair production threshold and increase the number of pairs in collisions of a hard compton photon with several laser photons simultaneously ( @xmath936 ) .",
    "thus , the absence of difficulties associated with inclusion of mass and calculation of spin flip amplitudes , and also the elegance of the results obtained , demonstrate the clear superiority of developed method to calculate matrix elements .",

    "<S> in- _  and _ out- _ particles to coincidence , allowing to separate in a covariant way the interactions with and without change of the spin states of the particles involved in the reaction and to follow in details the whole dynamics of the spin interactions . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to methods of calcul group and others , the developed approach is valid for both massive fermions and massless ones . </S>",
    "<S> it is not necessary to introduce auxiliary vectors in dsb . </S>",

    "<S> we apply this formalism to the following processes : 1 ) mller and bhabha bremsstrahlung ( @xmath0 ) in the ultrarelativistic ( massless ) limit when initial particles and photon are helicity polarized ; 2 ) compton back - scattering of photons of intensive circularly polarized laser wave focused on a beam of longitudinally polarized ultrarelativistic electrons ( @xmath1 ) ; 3 ) @xmath2-pair production by a hard photon in simultaneous collision with several laser beam photons ( @xmath3 ) ; 4 ) bethe - heitler process in the case of a linearly polarized photon emission by an electron with account for proton recoil and form factors ; 5 ) the reaction @xmath4 with proton polarizability being taken into account in the kinematics when proton bremsstrahlung dominates ; 6 ) orthopositronium 3-photon annihilation ( @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained with the help of the developed dsb - formalism certify its efficiency for calculating of multiparticle processes when polarization is to be taken into account .    </S>",
