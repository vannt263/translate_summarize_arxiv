    "@xmath8 , using @xmath4 as a time change gives a model of _ anomalous diffusion _ , where the mean - squared displacement of @xmath23 grows non - linearly in time .",
    "for example , if @xmath8 is an @xmath24-stable subordinator , that is , the subordinator whose lvy exponent is given by @xmath25 then the mean of @xmath19 is given by the power law @xmath26 .",
    "other types of non - linear behavior are also possible . in @xcite , meerschaert considers the subordinator with lvy exponent given by the following generalization of ( [ e : astable ] ) : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a probability measure on @xmath29 . depending on the choice of @xmath28 ,",
    "the mean of @xmath4 in this case can grow at logarithmic rates .",
    "meerschaert also shows in this case that the transition density of the process @xmath23 solves a time - fractional diffusion equation whose order is distributed according to @xmath28 .",
    "inverse subordinators have also appeared in many other areas of probability theory .",
    "early work regarding the joint distribution of @xmath19 and @xmath30 was done in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more recently , in @xcite , kaj and martin - lf show that a scaled sum of these processes converges weakly to another non - stable and non - gaussian process .",
    "an application of inverse subordinators in modeling of foreign exchange markets was considered in @xcite .",
    "distributional properties of inverse subordinators were studied in @xcite , which drew upon a connection with cox processes . a different approach using differential equations to characterize the joint distribution function of the process @xmath4 was used in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an important function in the study of inverse subordinators is the so - called _ renewal function _ , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , which is given by the mean of the inverse subordinator , @xmath33 .",
    "it has be shown by different methods that this function characterizes all finite - dimensional distributions of the process @xmath4 .",
    "the laplace transform of @xmath5 is given simply in terms of the lvy exponent @xmath7 , however , inverting this laplace transform to obtain @xmath5 in closed form is not always possible .",
    "in this paper , we provide two numerical methods for obtaining this mean first - passage time which take as input the drift @xmath34 and the lvy measure @xmath14 of the corresponding subordinator @xmath8 .",
    "once @xmath5 is obtained , higher order moments can be calculated by methods described in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we begin in section [ s : background ] by giving a brief background on the theory of inverse subordinators , as well as describe the importance of the function @xmath5 . in section [ s : numerical ] , we develop two methods for calculating @xmath5 numerically and test them in cases where @xmath5 can be computed analytically . in section [ s : examples ] we apply these techniques to the following examples : poisson process with drift ( section [ s : poisson ] ) , compound poisson process with pareto jumps ( section [ s : pareto ] ) , special cases of the `` mixed '' @xmath24-stable process ( section [ s : astable ] ) , and the generalized inverse gaussian lvy process ( section [ s : gig ] ) .",
    "for each example , we compute one and two - time moments of @xmath4 .",
    "methods to compute @xmath5 for each example are implemented in matlab .",
    "the software for doing this is freely available from the authors and its use is described in section [ s : guide ] .",
    "we start by recalling the fundamental relationship between a subordinator and its inverse .",
    "if @xmath8 is strictly increasing , then for @xmath35 and @xmath36 positive , @xmath37 if @xmath8 is not strictly increasing , then the above relationship holds off a set of measure @xmath10 in @xmath38 ( see @xcite ) .    as in the introduction , define the _ renewal function _ to be the mean of the inverse subordinator , @xmath39 for @xmath32 .",

    "since @xmath4 is non - decreasing , we can define the borel measure @xmath44 which is induced by @xmath5 , which is commonly referred to as the _ renewal measure_. notice that the renewal measure has the following property . for a.e .",

    "\\label{e : renewalmeasure}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by approximating with step functions , this relationship can be extended to continuous functions @xmath47 as @xmath48 . with this",
    ", we see the laplace transform of @xmath44 is given by @xmath49    the pair @xmath5 and @xmath44 can be used to compute all joint moments of the process @xmath4 . for non - negative integers @xmath50",
    "define @xmath51 the order of the moment in ( [ e : nmoment ] ) is defined to be @xmath52 .",
    "the following theorem from @xcite gives the @xmath53-time laplace transform @xmath54 in terms of a strictly lower older moment .",

    "taking inverse laplace transforms , the @xmath55 order moment is given as the sum of convolutions @xmath59 for full details , see @xcite .",
    "thus , if one knows the function @xmath60 , @xmath32 , then all higher order moments can be obtained inductively .",
    "for example , the covariance is given by @xmath61    it is not always easy , however , to invert the laplace transform ( [ e : lt_mfpt ] ) to obtain @xmath31 analytically . in the following ,",
    "we give two methods for numerically inverting this laplace transform given only the drift @xmath34 and lvy measure @xmath14 of the subordinator @xmath8 .",
    "once @xmath5 is obtained , the density of the renewal measure can be obtained by numerical differentiation and integral expressions such as ( [ e : inversecov1 ] ) can be approximated by numerical integration .",
    "the first method is based on the bromwhich integral which expresses the inverse laplace transform as a path integral in the complex plane , and the second is based on the post - widder inversion formula , which expresses @xmath5 as a limit of terms involving derivatives of @xmath42 .",
    "in section [ s : background ] we saw that all moments of an inverse subordinator can be computed if one has first computed the renewal function @xmath39 , which is given by the inverse laplace transform of ( [ e : lt_mfpt ] ) . in some cases , an analytical expression for @xmath5 can be found , and in most cases , the asymptotics of @xmath5 can be studied using a tauberian theorem . in this section",
    "we give two methods for calculating @xmath5 numerically .",
    "the first is simple and precise , but is difficult to use when @xmath7 is a complicated function .",
    "the second is more robust , but requires smoothness in @xmath5 to be effective .",
    "the first method involves calculating the inverse laplace transform of @xmath42 by numerically approximating the bromwich integral : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is chosen such that @xmath42 is analytic in the region @xmath64 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath65 for @xmath66 , and symmetry properties of analytic functions which are real valued on the real axis , ( [ e : bromwich ] ) simplifies into two equivalent expressions : @xmath67 for details see @xcite .",
    "since @xmath70 and @xmath7 is increasing in @xmath71 , @xmath6 has a singularity the origin .",
    "therefore , we much choose @xmath72 above . then , given @xmath34 and @xmath14 , we evaluate the integrals in ( [ e : phirphii ] ) to obtain @xmath73 and @xmath74 and use ( [ e : realut ] ) and ( [ e : imut ] ) to obtain @xmath75 and @xmath76 for fixed @xmath77 and then compute either integral in ( [ e : integral ] ) to get @xmath31 . alternatively ,",
    "if @xmath7 is known in closed form , then @xmath73 and @xmath74 can be computed directly .",
    "this method works fairly well when @xmath73 and @xmath74 are easy to compute , for instance , in the case of the poisson process with drift .",
    "the main problem with the method is when the integrands in ( [ e : integral ] ) and/or ( [ e : phirphii ] ) are highly oscillatory and slowly decaying , causing most integration algorithms to converge very slowly .",
    "the following method is based on the post - widder inversion formula ( @xcite , theorem 2 or  @xcite , section vii.6 ) . in order to justify using this formula in our case , we state and prove this result under slightly weaker conditions than those found in  @xcite .",

    "notice that @xmath95 has a gamma distribution with mean @xmath90 and variance @xmath96 . by the law of large numbers , @xmath97 as @xmath98 and by the continuous mapping theorem ( @xcite , theorem 5.10.4 ) , @xmath99 .",
    "observe that we also have the following convergence in mean : @xmath100 which follows from the uniform integrability of @xmath101 .",
    "this can be seen using the density of a gamma random variable and the assumption that @xmath102 as @xmath80 .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath103      * 1 . * in order to justify using the post - widder formula , we must be sure that the renewal function @xmath5 satisfies @xmath105 as @xmath106 .",
    "fortunately , the renewal theorem ( see for instance , proposition 3 in @xcite ) implies that if @xmath8 has finite mean , then @xmath31 will grow as @xmath107 as @xmath108 .",
    "if @xmath8 has infinite mean , its mean first hitting time @xmath109 will , on average , grow slower than in the finite mean case for large @xmath90 . to see this , any subordinator @xmath8 with infinite mean",
    "can be bounded below by a subordinator @xmath110 with finite mean by truncating the large jumps of @xmath8 for all @xmath111 a.s . ] .",

    "greater than @xmath4 , and thus @xmath113 .",
    "we will first focus on step @xmath119 above .",
    "the main difficulty with using this method resides in the fact that ( [ e : pwinversion ] ) involves derivatives of arbitrarily high orders , which are often difficult to compute .",

    "recall leibnitz s formula , which states that for smooth functions @xmath120 , @xmath121 let @xmath122,@xmath83 , and @xmath123 . applying leibnitz s formula to @xmath124 with @xmath125",

    ", we see that for any @xmath131 , @xmath132 from this , we obtain the following matrix equation : @xmath133 choosing @xmath134 , we conclude that @xmath129 satisfies the matrix equation @xmath135 , where @xmath136 and @xmath137 observe that the entries in @xmath138 are easily expressed in terms of the drift @xmath34 and the lvy measure @xmath14 corresponding to the subordinator @xmath8 .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath139 thus , to compute @xmath129 , one needs to compute the entries of @xmath138 using ( [ e : gji ] ) and ( [ e : phidiff ] ) , and then solve the matrix equation @xmath135 .",
    "notice that the integrals in ( [ e : phidiff ] ) are much easier to compute than those in section [ s : integration ] since the integrands do not oscillate ; they decay exponentially and are positive .",
    "observe that @xmath140 , and hence @xmath141 are easy to compute . using this method , we get @xmath142 in ( [ e : uks ] ) .",
    "the density @xmath143 of the renewal measure is also of interest , for example in ( [ e : inversecov1 ] ) .",
    "it can be approximated as @xmath5 is in ( [ e : uks ] ) , since the laplace transform of @xmath143 is @xmath144 .",
    "one needs to compute @xmath145 , which is obtained with no extra cost from ( [ e : matrixeqn ] ) since it is the last component of @xmath129 .    for step 2 above , we refer to the technique explained in @xcite .",
    "to summarize , it has been shown ( @xcite,@xcite ) that if @xmath5 is smooth , then we have the following series expansion : @xmath146 where @xmath147 are remainder terms .",
    "write @xmath148 and let @xmath149 . with this , ( [ e : seriesexp ] ) implies @xmath150 our goal is to compute @xmath151 with @xmath90 fixed . to do so",
    ", we consider @xmath152 as a function of @xmath153 and , given @xmath154 and @xmath155 , we write down the so - called `` lagrange polynomial '' @xmath156 : this is the polynomial of degree @xmath157 which passes through the @xmath53 points @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 observe that if @xmath161 for some @xmath162 , then all the summands in ( [ e : lagrangepoly ] ) vanish except for the term where @xmath163 , which is equal to @xmath164 .",
    "thus the polynomial @xmath156 passes through the @xmath53 points @xmath158 , @xmath159 .",
    "observe that we can not compute @xmath165 since @xmath166 corresponds to @xmath167 .",
    "however , with the method described above , we can compute @xmath168 for @xmath169 and then approximate @xmath170 by @xmath171 . since @xmath172 , @xmath5",
    "is then approximated by the linear combination @xmath173 where the weights @xmath174 , calculated by setting @xmath166 in ( [ e : lagrangepoly ] ) , depend on the choice of @xmath175 ) obtained by polynomial interpolation is equivalent to taking the linear combination which cancels the first @xmath53 remainder terms in ( [ e : seriesexp ] ) . ] .",
    "thus , given a desired level of accuracy @xmath181 and @xmath83 fixed , we compute the sequence @xmath182 until @xmath183 and then set @xmath184 . typically this method converges with @xmath185 for reasonable values of @xmath186 . since @xmath187 , it is often impossible to compute @xmath188 for @xmath189 in double precision arithmetic , as noted in the remarks below .",
    "note that for ( [ e : seriesexp ] ) to hold and for this method to be most effective , @xmath5 must be sufficiently smooth .",
    "we found that for points at which @xmath5 is not differentiable , the sequence @xmath190 had a slower rate of convergence .",
    "caution should be taken when computing terms like @xmath192 for @xmath193 large , since numbers like @xmath194 and @xmath195 are outside the range of double precision arithmetic .",
    "instead , one should use expressions like @xmath196 , because while @xmath197 and @xmath198 may be large , their ratio may be small .",
    "nevertheless , for large enough @xmath177 and @xmath199 ( relation ( [ e : vk ] ) , for example , which requires computing @xmath200 ) , even the ratio may be too large .",
    "this happens for instance if @xmath201 , in which case @xmath202 . to be safe , we used at most @xmath187 .",
    "a similar overflow problem can occur for @xmath203 large . to avoid this",
    ", one can make the following adjustment to ( [ e : pwinversion ] ) .",
    "let @xmath204 , then @xmath205 where @xmath206 is a rescaled version of @xmath42 : @xmath207 repeating the steps of this method with ( [ e : pwinversion2 ] ) , we get @xmath208 where @xmath209 and @xmath210 is the solution to the matrix equation @xmath211 , where @xmath212 . to compute these products and ratios , a procedure as the one describes in the previous remark should be done to avoid overflow .",

    "the approximation is very good .    for the poisson process",
