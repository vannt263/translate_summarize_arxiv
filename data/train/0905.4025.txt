    "the diffusion coefficient increase at some adlayer densities ( here @xmath112 ) is due to the attraction felt by particles at specific distances .",
    "the overall shape , however , of the coverage dependence of diffusion curves is always a result of several different , often compensating each other factors , like a character of interaction at different distances ( which affect both the static and the kinetic factor ) , a relative height of the interaction potential energy barrier which a hopping particle must overcome between adsorption sites ( which enters the kinetic factor ) .",
    "it is not possible , therefore , to guess from the interaction potential energy curves alone whether maxima of the diffusion coefficient at certain coverages do exist or do not . only analyzing the diffusion coefficient vs.  density curves we may rationalize the existence of certain characteristic features .",

    "this , however , can not be the only reason for such a behavior because , except at @xmath119 , such sudden slope changes are much less pronounced for purely repulsive interactions , certainly the attraction must also play a role .",

    "the interaction is effectively equivalent to a short range attraction ( the first minimum of the interaction potential energy is at @xmath164 ) while for @xmath148 the repulsion at @xmath121 competes with attraction at @xmath165 . for this intermediate case",
