    "psf photometry does not correct for multiple stars coincident well within the fwhm of the system .",
    "the clustercentric effects ( fig .",
    "[ fig - dist ] ,  [ fig - r ] ) impose a degeneracy which complicates the analysis of multiple populations and potential radial trends which are population - dependent ( e.g. , @xmath23 cen ) , although for the latter mixing over such a large timescale and mass segregation likewise require consideration .",
    "the signatures of multiple populations may be mimicked by photometric contamination .",
    "photometry acquired for m13 from the abbey ridge observatory ( aro ) confirms the trends observed in fig .",
    "[ fig - cmds ] .",
    "for example , as expected photometry near the core is artificially brighter and less complete owing to the increased sky brightness .",
    "the aro s comparatively small aperture telescope , in tandem with typically large local seeing , conspire to create a sizable fwhm ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "hst seeing is more than an order of magnitude smaller , and for that reason the aro data were acquired to provide an empirical means to evaluate contamination effects directly .",
    "the trends observed are not unique to a given dataset cited , but may be present ( to an extent ) in most globular cluster photometry .",

    "the absolute wesenheit function characterizing rr lyrae variables is thus : @xmath27 @xcite derived the lmc distance via a universal wesenheit template , which leverages the statistical weight of the entire variable star demographic to establish precise ( @xmath28% ) distances .",

    ". the template may be refined by employing new hst parallaxes for rz cep , xz cyg , su dra , uv oct , vy pyx , and @xmath30 pav @xcite .",
    "however , certain of the aforementioned stars lack reliable mean @xmath3 photometry , which is necessary for tabulating wesenheit magnitudes .",
    "the desired observations are presently being acquired via facilities operated by the aavso ( t. krajci & a. henden / bsm ) .",
    "type ii cepheids detected in the less - crowded outer region of m106 @xcite were likewise incorporated into the wesenheit template owing to the availability of a precise maser distance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the wesenheit approach obviates the need for uncertain reddening corrections , and thus the maser distance is used directly .",
    "admittedly , the approach supersedes one of the authors ( dm ) prior first - order ( yet ultimately incorrect ) effort to unify variables of the instability strip in order to establish reliable distances ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "equation  [ eqn - wvi2 ] may be employed to establish the distance to ngc2419 , however , a preferred approach is to simultaneously use the sx phe , rr lyrae , and type ii cepheid variables discovered by @xcite .",

    "the universal wesenheit template is shown as fig .",
    "[ fig - w ] .",
    "the template features galactic ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and m106 data , in addition to lmc variables cataloged by ogle ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which were incorporated into the template using the lmc distance derived by @xcite .",
    "designations for several variables tabulated in the ogle survey are inconsistent with their wesenheit magnitudes ( e.g. , overtone classical cepheids on the fundamental mode ridge , etc . ) , yet these objects constitute the minority ( see also the break between @xmath29 scuti and overtone classical cepheids ) .    to mitigate the effects of contaminated photometry stars @xmath31 ( subjective ) from the core of ngc2419 were utilized to deduce the distance .",
    "stars exhibiting anomalous wesenheit positions were not included in the determination .",
    "the offset from the wesenheit template implies @xmath32 for ngc2419 , which is consistent with estimates tabulated by harris and @xcite .",
    "the distance is merely evaluated for illustrative purposes since the maximum extent of the contamination is unclear ( fig .  [ fig - dist ] ) .",
    "the analysis reveals that the type ii cepheid ( v18 ) is either contaminated , a binary system , anomalous , or not a cluster member ( fig .",
    "[ fig - w ] ) .",
    "the binary hypothesis is supported by the discovery of numerous binary classical and type ii cepheids in the galaxy and lmc @xcite .",
    "the three sx phe variables lie on the wesenheit ridge tied to fundamental mode pulsators ( fig .",

    "sx phe and other metal - poor population ii @xmath29 scutis lie toward the short - period extension of the wesenheit ridge characterizing population i @xmath29 scutis .",
    "the analysis reaffirms that a ( deleterious ) clustercentric distance dependence exists in photometry associated with the globular clusters m15 , m2 , m3 , m54 , m92 , ngc2419 , ngc6441 , @xmath23 cen , m4 , m13 , and ngc2808 ( figs .",
