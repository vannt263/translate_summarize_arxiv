    "when subject to external forces , disordered materials such as emulsions , colloidal suspensions , and granular media exhibit a nontrivial response , which has received considerable attention over the last two decades @xcite .",
    "highly heterogeneous force networks form between the particles @xcite and one of the main concerns regarding the contact force statistics is their asymptotic behavior at large forces .    early experimental measurements @xcite and numerical simulations with contact dynamics @xcite or soft particle methods with hookian @xcite and hertzian @xcite interactions reported an exponential tail for the normal force distribution @xmath0 .",
    "however , faster than exponential tails were also found later in experiments @xcite and simulations with hookian @xcite , hertzian @xcite and other force laws @xcite .",
    "there have been theoretical attempts to explain the tail behavior @xcite which mainly support the exponential decay .",
    "more recently , tighe et al .",
    "@xcite took the force balance at the particle level into account when maximizing the entropy with respect to the admissible force states and proposed an analytic expression for the normal force distribution in static granular media , predicting a gaussian behavior for large forces , supported by a numerical study @xcite within the framework of the force network ensemble @xcite .",
    "some of the studies observe a crossover form an exponential - like to a faster than exponential behavior with increasing the applied isotropic compression @xcite . in this paper",
    "we provide numerical evidence for the faster than exponential decay in frictional soft spheres , and address the question whether the asymptotic behavior changes qualitatively when approaching the jamming transition .",
    "much less has been reported so far on the tangential force distribution @xmath1 @xcite and the evolution of the force distributions during deformation processes . here , we study the evolution of the tangential force distribution as well as the friction mobilization during the isotropic compression .",
    "note that for example the experiments on photoelastic particles provide evidence for a different behavior of the force distributions in sheared systems .",
    "for example , @xmath0 of sheared packings decays much more slowly than that of the compressed ones . besides the path dependence of the deformation , shear induced anisotropy has been also reported @xcite .",
    "the study of sheared systems is however beyond the scope of this work .",
    "in this report , the evolution of the inter - particle forces during a quasi - static isotropic compression was studied numerically ( using dem simulations ) .",
    "the two dimensional simulation box has periodic boundaries to avoid effects due to the presence of walls .",
    "the particle interactions are computed , using a linear spring - dashpot model for both normal and tangential forces ( with the spring constant ratio @xmath5 either being @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) , as well as the hertz - mindlin model as described in @xcite .",
    "the tangential force is additionally limited by the coulomb limit .",
    "the results presented throughout the paper belong to the linear force law with friction coefficient @xmath8 and stiffness ratio @xmath9 , unless stated otherwise .",
    "the packings consist of nearly @xmath10 disks with radii taken from a uniform distribution in the range @xmath11 $ ] , where @xmath12 is the average particle radius and is used as the natural unit of length in the following .",
    "the unit of force is chosen to be @xmath13 .",
    "the initial configuration is generated by randomly placing the particles without accepting any overlap between them .",
    "afterwards , this unjammed system is compressed quasi - statically through a sequence of incremental compression and relaxation steps .",
    "a compression step is realized by re - scaling the particle positions and keeping their radii fixed .",
    "the relaxation routine ensures that the net force exerted on each particle is a factor of @xmath14 below the mean contact force , before the next deformation step starts .",
    "each time the system is equilibrated , the force state of the packing is stored .",
    "this process continues until the average overlap exceeds a given value . upon decreasing the volume , the average overlap @xmath15 remains zero until the jamming transition is reached . beyond this transition",
    "@xmath15 increases with the compression and , due to its purely geometric origin , is chosen as the order parameter to characterize the jammed state .",
    "note that ohern et al .",
    "@xcite suggested that averaging over configurations with slightly different average forces can distort the results close to the jamming transition .",
    "to avoid such effects , the calculated distributions in our study are taken from single realizations .",
    "for increasing applied deformation .",
    "inset : the same plot in log - lin scale .",
    "the lines are fits using eq .",

    "( b ) the standard deviation @xmath16 ( full circles ) , the skewness @xmath17 ( open triangles ) , and the excess kurtosis @xmath18 ( open squares ) versus @xmath15 . ]    upon increasing the deformation in our simulations , not only the mean value of @xmath19 increases but also the shape of the distribution is affected , e.g. , the standard deviation and skewness change .",
    "using the normalized contact force @xmath20 , three typical distributions @xmath21 at different values of @xmath15 are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure:1](a ) . in all cases ,",
    "the distribution has a peak and one can see that the tail of the distributions gradually becomes more bent during the compression process .",
    "these results , as well as the observations for the tangential forces and mobilization ( discussed below ) are in good agreement with experimental results by majmudar and behringer @xcite .",
    "fits of the form @xmath22 weighted with the reciprocal variance , are found to characterize the shape of @xmath23 for different compressions ( see lines in fig .  [",
    "figure:1](a ) ) .",
    "the fitting parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are not independent , due to constrains for the normalization @xmath29 and on the first moment @xmath30 of the distribution .",
    "thus the number of fit parameters can be reduced to three . even without taking the constrains into account during fitting ,",
    "they are fulfilled with deviations below @xmath31 .",
    "note that the fit in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pnform ] ) captures not only the tail behavior but also the overall shape of the distribution with effectively three fitting parameters .",
    "the robustness of the results with respect to the microscopic properties of the interparticle force is studied , using different values of friction coefficient @xmath32 and stiffness ratio @xmath5 , as well as linear and non - linear force laws .",
    "the results for four sets of the parameters are shown in fig  [ figure:2 ] .",
    "while the exact values of the fitting parameters depend on the contact force properties , the qualitative behavior in terms of the mean normal overlap is universal .",
    "for example , the exponent @xmath28 is found to be independent of the compression with values ranging from @xmath33 to @xmath34 , depending on the contact properties .",
    "allowing for this additional parameter leads to fits that capture the tail behavior substantially better than gaussian ( @xmath35 ) or exponential ( @xmath36 ) fits .",
    "this supports the reports on a decay faster than exponential for large forces and shows that while the shape of the distribution changes as the jamming transition is approached , the asymptotic behavior for large forces remains the same .    , @xmath27 , @xmath26 , and @xmath25 according to eq . for systems with different contact force properties . ]",
    "the evolution of the width @xmath26 with increasing deformation is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure:2 ] , indicating that the normalized distributions become narrower .",
    "the figure also shows that the exponent @xmath25 decreases with @xmath15 , while the shift @xmath27 increases with the compression . in fig .",
    "[ figure:1](b ) , the shape change of @xmath23 is investigated by calculating higher moments of the force sets .",
    "the standard deviation , @xmath16 , of the data decreases with @xmath15 , similar to the behavior of @xmath26 . a smaller standard deviation of the normalized forces at higher compression corresponds to a more homogeneous force network .",
    "for comparison , let us consider a situation where all contact forces are just rescaled , when increasing the external load . in this case , the relative width of the force distribution would remain constant . the fact that @xmath16 decreases may be attributed to the possibility of opening and closing of new contacts during the compression , and also to the nonaffine motions which allow local changes of the overlaps leading to a more uniform stress at larger deformation .",
    "the skewness @xmath17 , which reflects the degree of asymmetry of a distribution ( for @xmath37 being symmetric ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure:1 ] .",
    "it is a decreasing function of @xmath15 , thus , the distributions become more symmetric at larger deformations .",
    "the excess kurtosis @xmath18 describes the peakedness and tail behavior of the distribution",
    ". a higher @xmath18 represents a fatter tail ( slower decay ) .",
    "therefore , the decrease of @xmath18 in fig .  [ figure:1](b ) agrees with the observation that the bending of the tail increases , when the packing is more compressed .",
    "the behavior for @xmath38 and @xmath39 may have led to the impression of a crossover between an exponential and gaussian tail in previous publications .       for different values of the mean overlap @xmath15 .",
    "inset : same in log - lin scale .",
    "the lines indicate fits given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ptform ] ) .",
    "( b ) the shift @xmath40 of the gaussian versus @xmath15 .",
    "( c ) the average tangential force @xmath41 ( full circles ) and the standard deviation @xmath42 ( open circles ) versus @xmath15 .",
    "the solid line corresponds to a linear increase . ]",
    "the distribution of tangential forces is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath43 , without a notable peak or plateau .",
    "figure [ figure:3](a ) shows that the data nearly collapse for different compressions , if the forces are normalized with the mean force @xmath44 , which means that the distribution broadens with increasing strain .",
    "the semi - logarithmic inset shows an increasing curvature with increasing average overlap ( even though much less pronounced than for@xmath45 ) , indicating a non - exponential behavior .",
    "the data over the whole range of tangential forces can be fitted with @xmath46 ,   \\label{eq : ptform}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the fitting parameter and the normalization gives @xmath47 , while the constraint for the first moment leads to @xmath48 adding a variable exponent ( like @xmath28 in ) in the exponential function as an additional parameter does not improve the fit .",
    "adding an additional power law term , leads to a small , negative exponent ( @xmath49 ) and thus an almost constant pre - factor .",
    "an alternative fit to an exponential which has been proposed in the literature is only applicable for the tail in the low deformation regime and can not be supported by the data in this study .",
    "figure [ figure:3](b ) shows that @xmath40 first decreases with compression and then reaches an overlap - independent regime for overlaps larger than @xmath50 .",
    "the standard deviation @xmath42 of the normalized tangential forces , shown in figure [ figure:3](c ) , decreases by about @xmath51 similarly to @xmath16 .",
    "the average tangential force increases linearly with increasing overlap ( see fig .",
    "[ figure:3](c ) ) .     for different strains .",
    "( b ) fraction of the nearly mobilized contacts @xmath52 ( separately shown for small and large normal forces ) , and the distance from isostaticity @xmath53 in terms of @xmath15 for the linear force law with @xmath54 .",
    "( c),(d ) histograms of the friction mobilization @xmath55 for small and large forces in the packing with @xmath56 . ]      to elucidate the influence of friction on the evolution of the contact forces , the distribution of friction mobilization @xmath2 is studied .",
    "the coulomb condition specifies that @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , the mobilization @xmath58 quantifies the distance of a contact from the coulomb friction limit .",
    "it varies within the range @xmath59 $ ] , with @xmath60 for fully mobilized contacts , i.e.  those contacts in the static packing that are on the verge of sliding .",
    "figure [ figure:4](a ) shows that @xmath2 decays with increasing @xmath55 except for a peak at @xmath61 .",
    "similar results were observed in experiments with photoelastic particles @xcite .",
    "the decay of @xmath2 shows that most of the contacts are far from the coulomb limit . with increasing deformation",
    ", @xmath2 grows for small and decreases for large @xmath55 , i.e.  the probability distribution becomes steeper .",
    "the probability of fully mobilized contacts , however , remains approximately independent of @xmath62 .",
    "this is shown more clearly in fig .",
    "[ figure:4](b ) , where the fraction @xmath52 of contacts with a mobilization close to one ( @xmath63 ) is separately calculated for weak ( @xmath64 ) and strong ( @xmath65 ) normal forces , since the underlying mechanisms of stress propagation have been found to be different for these two subnetworks @xcite .",
    "@xmath52 fluctuates around @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) for weak ( strong ) forces .",
    "note that these values depend in general on the friction coefficient @xcite .",
    "the constant nature of @xmath52 together with the increase of the average coordination number @xmath68 with @xmath15 indicates that the excess coordination number of the packing @xmath69 grows when increasing the applied deformation [ fig .",
    "[ figure:4](b ) ] .",
    "it was shown that the mechanical response of frictional packings exhibits a critical scaling with @xmath70 in the limit of @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "more generally , @xmath70 influences the extent of force indeterminacy which governs the stability of the granular packings @xcite .",
    "the enhancement of mechanical stability with increasing the compression can be also traced back to the fact that topological properties of the force network , like the number of triangular structures , evolve during the process @xcite , allowing to predict the jamming transition point .",
    "the triangular structures are found to play an important role in stabilizing the packing @xcite .    the majority of the contacts with a mobilization close to @xmath7 carry a normal force below the average .",
    "figures  [ figure:4](c ) and ( d ) show the distribution of @xmath55 separately for both categories of forces .",
    "in addition to the difference at @xmath72 , the histogram is steeper for strong forces .",
    "this shows that the force network of the strong forces is more stable and sliding events mainly occur at weak contacts .     versus @xmath73 for the packing with @xmath74 .",
    "( b ) the correlation between @xmath73 and @xmath55 as a function of @xmath75 , separately shown for small ( full circles ) and large ( open circles ) forces . ]",
    "the simulation results reveal a dependence of the friction mobilization at a contact on the magnitude of the normal force carried by that contact .",
    "figure  [ figure:5](a ) shows a typical scatter plot of @xmath55 versus @xmath76 .",
    "the accumulation of contacts with @xmath77 denotes the fully mobilized contacts at the edge of the coulomb friction cone . for weak normal forces",
    ", the data points are scattered over the whole range of possible mobilizations . however ,",
    "at strong normal forces , they tend towards smaller values of @xmath55 and the fraction of fully mobilized contacts diminishes .",
    "this results in the decrease of the average mobilization as a function of the normal force ( not shown ) .",
    "thus the contacts which carry small normal forces are more liable for non - elastic deformations not only due to the higher chance of opening for such contacts ( because of a smaller overlap ) , but also due to sliding , since these contacts have a larger mobilization . to quantify the relation , the pearson correlation coefficient of @xmath19 and @xmath55 is shown in fig .  [ figure:5](b ) .",
    "the correlation is calculated for each packing , separately for weak and strong forces . while the correlations are scattered around zero for weak normal forces",
    ", there is a robust anti - correlation between @xmath19 and @xmath55 for strong forces , which remains unchanged over the whole range of deformations .",
    "this verifies again that @xmath19 and @xmath55 are inversely related to each other , and that larger forces show a lower probability to exceed the sliding threshold than small forces .",
    "the inter - particle force evolution during the isotropic compression of soft particle packings was investigated and empirical expressions for the normal and tangential force distributions were presented , that showed a faster than exponential decay for large forces .",
    "the results revealed that the relative width of the distributions decrease with increasing deformation , leading to a more homogeneous force network .",
    "it is notable that while the width of the distribution changes , the decay of the large forces remains unchanged .",
    "the investigation of friction mobilization @xmath55 showed that , independent of the deformation , the fully mobilized contacts are most likely those carrying small normal forces .",
    "finally , we note that the investigation of sheared systems is essential as a further step towards understanding the deformation at the microscopic level , which complements the theoretical studies based on the assumption of affine motion of particles @xcite and facilitates the development of a general microscopic model for the deformation of granular materials .",
