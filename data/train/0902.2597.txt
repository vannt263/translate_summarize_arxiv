    "the reionization and metal enrichment of the universe are thought to begin with the formation of first metal - free ( pop iii ) stars @xcite .",
    "hence , the formation rate of pop iii stars is crucial for the subsequent structure formation in the universe .",
    "the pop iii objects are expected to collapse at @xmath3 , forming a minihalo with a mass of @xmath4 and an extent of @xmath5pc @xcite . in the course of bottom - up structure formation , such pop iii minihaloes",
    "merge to form first galaxies at @xmath6 , having the virial temperature @xmath7k and the mass @xmath8 . even in the evolution of first galaxies ,",
    "pop iii stars can play a significant role , since an appreciable number of stars may form from metal - free component in interstellar gas @xcite .",
    "the formation of very first stars has been investigated intensively in the last decade .",
    "many studies have come to a similar conclusion that such stars form in a top - heavy mass function with the peak of @xmath9 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite have shown that the variations of cosmological density fluctuations allow the mass of pop iii stars to be down to @xmath10 .",
    "on the other hand , the secondary pop iii star formation has been investigated recently .",
    "the formation of secondary stars is subject to various feedback effects by first stars .",
    "one of them is the supernova ( sn ) feedback through mechanical and chemical effects .",
    "the negative feedback by sne is the evaporation of neighboring clouds , since the sn shock heats up the gas in clouds . on the hand",
    ", sne can bring positive feedback through the compression by shock and the cooling by ejected heavy elements .",
    "the secondary star formation can be promoted by such positive feedback effects @xcite .",
    "another important feedback effect is brought by the ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation from first stars , since they are very luminous at ultraviolet band .",
    "first stars photoionize and photoheat the surrounding media , and also photodissociate h@xmath11 molecules , which are the main coolant of primordial gas .",
    "the radiative feedback from first stars is the primary feedback until first stars end the life - time of @xmath12yr with sne .",
    "the photodissociation of h@xmath11 molecules leads to a negative radiative feedback effect , which has been studied by many authors so far .",
    "@xcite investigated the effect of h@xmath11-dissociating radiation from a single pop iii star residing in a virialized halo .",
    "they found that if the halo is uniform , h@xmath11 molecules in the halo are totally dissociated , so that the gas can not collapse to form stars .",
    "@xcite considered more realistic clumpy halos .",
    "they found that if the gas density is sufficiently high , photodissociation process proceeds slower than the collapse of the cloud .",
    "hence , the cloud can form stars .",
    "this result is confirmed by the recent 3d radiation hydrodynamic simulation by @xcite including the effects of hydrodynamics as well as the radiation transfer of h@xmath11-dissociating radiation .",
    "the feedback effects by diffuse h@xmath11-dissociating radiation can be important after the local feedback in minihaloes @xcite .",
    "these works basically focused on the photodissociation effects .",
    "we also have to take into account the effects of ionizing photons .",
    "ionizing radiation heats up the gas through the photoionization processes .",
    "the temperature of photoheated gas is kept to be around @xmath13k , owing to the balance between the radiative cooling and photoheating .",
    "if the gravitational potential of star forming halos are not so deep as to retain the photoheated gas , the heated gas evaporates from the halos ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the case in which ionizing radiation is coupled with h@xmath11-dissociating radiation is complex .",
    "when an ionization front ( i - front ) propagates in a collapsing core , the enhanced fraction of electrons catalyzes h@xmath11 formation @xcite .",
    "in particular , the mild ionization ahead of the i - front generates an h@xmath11 shell , which potentially shields h@xmath11 dissociating photons @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is likely to work positively to form pop iii stars . on the other hand ,",
    "the i - front can be accompanied with a shock for an optically - thick cloud @xcite .",
    "the shock affects significantly the collapse of cloud .",
    "this is a totally radiation hydrodynamic ( rhd ) process .",
    "such radiation hydrodynamic feedback has been investigated by 1d spherical rhd simulations @xcite , 2d cylindrical rhd simulations @xcite , and 3d rhd simulations @xcite .",
    "the results by 2d and 3d simulations are in good agreement with each other .",
    "it is found that ionizing radiation can bring positive feedback through the formation of h@xmath11 shell .",
    "@xcite investigated rhd feedback by a @xmath14 source star , and @xcite derived the feedback criterion .",
    "however , if a source star is less massive , the relative intensity of h@xmath11-dissociating radiation to ionizing radiation increases .",
    "then , the feedback tends to be more negative .",
    "in fact , the mass of first stars might be some @xmath15 owing to the variations of cosmological density fluctuations @xcite , the enhanced h@xmath11 cooling in pre - ionized gas @xcite , or the hd cooling in fossil hii regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "also , the elemental abundance patterns of hyper - metal - poor stars well match the yields by supernova explosions with a progenitor mass of @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the rhd feedback effects by pop iii stars less massive than @xmath17 have not been investigated so far , and no criterion has not been derived .    in this paper , we perform 3d rhd simulations in order to investigate the radiative feedback effects from pop iii stars with various masses .",
    "we derive the criteria for the collapse of cloud cores irradiated by a neighboring pop iii star with 25,40,80 , or @xmath14 . in  2 , the simulation code and procedure are described .",

    "we use the chemical network solver in @xcite as well as the radiative transfer solver described in @xcite . for the shielding by @xmath1 molecules against h@xmath11-dissociating radiation at lyman - werner ( lw ) band ( 11.26 - 13.6 ev )",

    "the cloud is initially uniform with the density of @xmath29 , and has the mass of @xmath30 .",
    "the initial chemical compositions are assumed to be the cosmological compositions provided by @xcite . before the uv irradiation , the cloud contracts self - gravitationally to form a collapsing core . as for the core temperature @xmath31",
    ", we employ two models .",
    "one is a high temperature model , and the other is a low temperature model . by changing the initial temperature of the clouds @xmath32",
    ", we realize such core temperatures . as shown in fig .",

    "if the initial temperature is set to be @xmath36k , the cloud core cools below @xmath37k , since @xmath1 molecules are rapidly formed owing to the high initial temperature ( see fig.[rhot ] ) .",
    "another difference between two models is the ratio of gravitational energy @xmath38 to internal energy @xmath39 , because it is dependent on the initial temperature .",
    "the @xmath40 ratio is @xmath41 for the low initial temperature ( high @xmath31 ) model , while the @xmath40 ratio is @xmath42 for the high initial temperature ( low @xmath31 ) model .",

    "the properties of source stars as the effective temperature of star @xmath46 , the number of ionizing photons emitted per second @xmath47 , and the luminosity at lw band are taken from @xcite , which are summarized in table 1 .",
    "note that we do not consider the lifetimes of source stars in this paper , since we focus on elucidating the rhd feedback before sn explosions .",

    "the simulations are performed until @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the free - fall time determined by @xmath43 .",
    "if the density of cloud core exceeds @xmath51 before @xmath52 , we stop the calculation , since the cloud is expected to keep collapsing . in order to clarify the effects of the ionizing radiation",
    ", we also perform the simulations artificially disregarding ionizing radiation but still including lw radiation , and the results are compared with those of normal simulations .",
    "the number of sph particles handled in our simulations is 262,144 for all runs .",
    "the present simulations are mainly carried out with a novel hybrid computer system in university of tsukuba , called _ first _ simulator , which has been designed to simulate multi - component self - gravitating radiation hydrodynamic systems with high accuracy @xcite .",

    "the results with ionizing radiation are compared to those without ionizing radiation . in the simulation with ionizing radiation ,",
    "the density of cloud core keeps increasing , and the density exceeds the limit ( @xmath51 ) due to the run - away collapse at 3.4myr after the ignition of the source star . on the other hand , in the simulation without ionizing radiation , the gravitational contraction of cloud core",
    "is stopped by the thermal pressure , and eventually a hydrostatic core forms .",
    "various physical quantities along the symmetry axis at 1myr are shown in fig . [ vpq80 m ] . if ionizing radiation is included , a dense shell forms ahead of the ionization front ( i - front ) .",
    "the @xmath1 molecule fraction is raised up to a level @xmath56 in the shell , so that @xmath1 column density exceeds @xmath27 .",
    "owing to the self - shielding of lw band radiation by the shell , the @xmath1 fraction in the cloud core is increased , compared to the case without ionizing radiation .",
    "eventually , the enhanced @xmath1 cooling allows the core to undergo the run - away collapse . on the other hand ,",
    "unless ionizing radiation is included , lw band radiation from the source star reduces the @xmath1 fraction , so that the cloud core is settled in a hydrostatic configuration .",

    "as shown in fig . [ evo25 m ] , the cloud fails to collapse and a hydrostatic core forms , notwithstanding the presence of ionizing radiation .",
    "similar to the case of @xmath53 , the h@xmath11 fraction ahead of the i - front is enhanced associated with a dense shell . however , the h@xmath11 column density of the shell is not high enough to shield the h@xmath11 dissociating photons .",
    "thus , the h@xmath11 fraction at the cloud core stays as low as @xmath60 , which is the almost same level in the case without ionizing radiation .",
    "thus , in this lower stellar mass case , the ionizing radiation can not suppress the negative feedback .",
    "in fig . [ evo80mlow ] and fig . [ vpq80mlow ] , the results for the low core temperature model ( @xmath37k ) are shown . in these simulations ,",
    "the parameters are set to be @xmath61 , @xmath62pc , and @xmath63 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ evo80mlow ] , the cloud fails to collapse , despite the presence of ionizing radiation .",
    "however , the reason for the failure is different from the @xmath64 case .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ vpq80mlow ] that the shielding effect raises the @xmath1 column density , compared to the case with no ionizing radiation . in this low core temperature model , hydrogen molecules",
    "are strongly destroyed by the lw radiation , and the @xmath1 fraction decreases to @xmath65 . since the core radius is smaller for the low core temperature , the self - shielding for lw radiation by the core is weaker .",

    "however , in the case of @xmath67 , ionizing radiation does not help the clouds to collapse , but the fate of clouds is determined solely by h@xmath11-dissociating radiation .",

    "but , the regions of the collapse with the aid of ionizing radiation ( triangles ) are obviously narrower , and in wider regions the clouds fail to collapse . these results basically originates in the fact that the radius of cloud core is smaller , compared to a high core temperature model with @xmath34k . for the smaller core radius ,",
    "h@xmath11-dissociating radiation is liable to permeate and suppress the core collapse .",
    "however , the critical stellar mass , @xmath69 , below which ionizing radiation can not extinguish the negative feedback by photodissociation , is almost the same as that in the case with @xmath70k .",

    "@xcite explored the photodissociation feedback of a pop iii star with @xmath72 on a neighboring prestellar core by rhd simulations which dose not include ionizing radiation .",

    "this equation involves the self - shielding effect by the core .",
    "the dependence on the core temperature basically originates in the core radius ( @xmath79 ) and the @xmath1 formation rate in the core ( @xmath80 ) .",

    ". this disagreement can be understand by the dynamical effect of the collapsing clouds @xcite .",
    "the actual dynamical contraction is faster for the high core temperature model , since the ratio of gravitational energy to internal energy is higher ( @xmath82 ) as described in ",
    "then , the @xmath1 fraction in the core recovers rapidly , during the adiabatic compression phase .",

    ", the dynamical effect is not so strong because of @xmath87 , and therefore @xmath88 .",
    "furthermore , if the ionizing radiation is included , we should incorporate the shielding effect by an @xmath1 shell . here , we derive a new criterion including the this effect . since a cloud collapses in a self - similar fashion before uv irradiation , the density profile of outer envelope in the cloud is expressed as @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the core radius which roughly corresponds to the jeans scale ; @xmath91 where @xmath92 denotes the boltzmann constant and @xmath93 denotes the proton mass .",
    "assuming that the thickness of the @xmath1 shell is determined by the amount of ionized gas in the envelope and the @xmath94 fraction in the shell is constant , the @xmath1 column density of the shell @xmath95 is given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 , and @xmath98 are the distance between the cloud core and the @xmath99 shell , and the @xmath1 fraction in the shell , respectively . here ,",
    "@xmath97 is set to be the position where the number of recombination per unit time in the ionized region around a source star balances with the number rate of incident ionizing photons , since the @xmath1 shell appears ahead of ionization front .",
    "hence , @xmath97 satisfies @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the recombination coefficient to all excited levels of hydrogen .",
    "using equation ( [ nh2sh1 ] ) and ( [ nion ] ) , we obtain @xmath102 because of the intense lw radiation , the @xmath1 at the shell is in chemical equilibrium .",
    "therefore , @xmath98 is given by @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the electron fraction at the @xmath1 shell and @xmath105 is the reaction rate of @xmath21 process . in this case",
    ", we should consider the self - shielding effect by the shell itself . as a result , these rates are @xmath106 @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are the temperature at the shell , and the lw flux from the star in the absence of shielding effect , @xmath110 .",
    "in addition , @xmath111 is the self - shielding function given by ( [ shield - function ] ) .",
    "combining equations ( [ nh2sh2])-([kdis ] ) with assumption of @xmath112 and @xmath113k as shown in the present numerical results , we have @xmath114 @xmath115 notice that @xmath95 is determined solely by the ratio of @xmath116 to @xmath77 , and strongly depends on the ratio . in the above numerical results , it is shown that the critical stellar mass does not depend sensitively on the cloud core temperature .",
    "this fact is consistent with equation ( [ nh2sh3 ] ) , in which the @xmath1 column density of shell is independent of the core temperature @xmath31 .",
    "multiplying @xmath77 in equation ( [ dcrd ] ) by @xmath117 , we obtain the critical distance as @xmath118 in which both shielding effects by the core and the @xmath1 shell are taken into account .",

    "<S> we explore the impact of ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation from massive population iii ( pop iii ) stars of 25 , 40 , 80 , and 120 @xmath0 on the subsequent pop iii star formation . in this paper , particular attention is paid to the dependence of radiative feedback on the mass of source pop iii star . </S>",
    "<S> uv radiation from the source star can work to impede the secondary star formation through the photoheating and photodissociation processes . </S>",
    "<S> recently , susa & umemura ( 2006 ) have shown that the ionizing radiation alleviates the negative effect by @xmath1-dissociating radiation from 120@xmath0 popiii star , since an @xmath1 shell formed ahead of an ionizing front can effectively shield @xmath1-dissociating radiation . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , it is expected that the negative feedback by @xmath1-dissociating radiation can be predominant if a source star is less massive , since a ratio of the @xmath1-dissociating photon number to the ionizing photon number becomes higher . in order to investigate the radiative feedback effects from such less massive stars , </S>",
    "<S> we perform three - dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations , incorporating the radiative transfer effect of ionizing and @xmath1-dissociating radiation . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , we find that if a source star is less massive than @xmath2 , the ionizing radiation can not suppress the negative feedback of @xmath1-dissociating radiation . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the fate of the neighboring clouds around such less massive stars is determined solely by the flux of @xmath1-dissociating radiation from source stars . with making analytic estimates of @xmath1 shell formation and its shielding effect </S>",
    "<S> , we derive the criteria for radiation hydrodynamic feedback depending on the source star mass .    </S>",
