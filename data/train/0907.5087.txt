    "@xcite in this picture only the chromium sites are magnetic and the double exchange mechanism between the cr@xmath11 and the cr@xmath12 ions align their magnetic moment parallel . however , early neutron diffration studies indicated that each chromium is in the cr@xmath11 state .",
    "@xcite later , goodenough proposed the copper ions to be divalent cu@xmath14 and as a source of the magnetism the 90 degree superexchange to be responsible for the coupling between the cr@xmath11 ions through the completely filled se 4p states .",

    "@xcite    in order to have a deeper understanding of the electronic structure of cucr@xmath0se@xmath1 we have investigated the low - energy ( e=0.1 - 4ev ) charge excitations over the temperature range of t=10 - 300k by determining both diagonal and off - diagonal element of the optical conductivity tensor . beside the low - energy response of the metallic carriers and the charge transfer excitations above @xmath15ev , we have found a sharp and distinct optical transition in the mid - infrared region with large magneto - optical activity .",

    "@xcite it has a low - energy shoulder located at e=1.9ev which likely originates from the on - site chromium d - d transition since this structure is common for chromium spinels insensitive to the change of the other cation .",
    "@xcite this originally dipole - forbidden transition becomes allowed by the hybridization with the ligand , which results in the fairly small oscillatory strength .",

    "although the magnetization is almost constant below room temperature , the moke is enhanced by 45@xmath8 down to @xmath36@xmath5@xmath37k .    from the complex kerr angle",
    ", we have calculated the off - diagonal conductivity according to the following relation : @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the elements of the complex optical conductivity tensor .",
    "the kerr rotation and ellipticity describe the phase - shift and the intensity difference , respectively , between left and right circularly polarized light upon normal - incidence reflection from a magnetic surface .",
    "the corresponding results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .    in spite of the large moke around @xmath2@xmath5@xmath25ev ,",
    "neither the off - diagonal nor the diagonal conductivity show any specific optical excitation in this energy region .",
    "the large enhancement of the moke signal corresponds to the plasma resonance at @xmath31@xmath25ev ; it is caused by the strong minimum of the denominator of eq .",
    "[ sxy_formula ] rather than by an increase of the off - diagonal conductivity.@xcite the almost perfect cancelation of this resonance in the off - diagonal conductivity indicates the properness of the kramers - kronig transformation for the reflectivity .",
    "when the optical excitations are broad compared to the magnetically induced splitting of these transitions for the two circular polarizations , the kerr parameters @xmath34 and @xmath32 are proportional to the derivative of the reflectivity : @xmath44 where @xmath45=r@xmath46e@xmath47 are the fresnel coefficients for the right and left circularly polarized photons and @xmath48@xmath5@xmath49 and @xmath50 are the reflectivity and the corresponding phase .",
    "the sudden decrease of the reflectivity near the plasma edge , which generate the large moke signal , is sensitive to the slope of the reflectivity which becomes steeper as the life - time increases toward low temperatures , causing considerable temperature dependence in the region of the plasma resonance .    .",

    "[ fig3 ] ) is dominated by two main structures , namely a broader hump around @xmath2@xmath5@xmath21ev and a resonance - like peak centered at @xmath2@xmath5@xmath6ev . the dispersive line - shape in the imaginary part of the off - diagonal conductivity and also the corresponding large values  im@xmath51=53@xmath52 and im@xmath51=110@xmath52 at @xmath36@xmath5@xmath37k ,",
    "respectively  are suggestive of parity allowed transitions , which is reasonable for the se 4p@xmath20cr 3d charge transfer transition at @xmath2@xmath5@xmath21ev . the magnitude of the low - energy part of the off - diagonal conductivity enlarged in fig .  [ fig4 ] .",
    "is very close to that of the dc hall effect obtained in the same magnetic field,@xcite except for @xmath36@xmath5@xmath37k where @xmath53@xmath5@xmath54@xmath52 .",
    "as the temperature decreases the low - energy tail of the real part is considerably reduced in contrast to the temperature independent behavior of the magnetization .",
    "this may indicate that a non - perturbative treatment of the spin - orbit coupling is also necessary to describe the low - energy off - diagonal conductivity as it was formerly proposed for the dc anomalous hall effect.@xcite        the relations between the elements of the optical conductivity tensor and the underlying microscopic optical processes are described by the kubo formula : @xmath55f(\\varepsilon_i ) \\{|\\langle f|\\pi_+|i\\rangle|^2 + \\nonumber\\\\ + |\\langle f|\\pi_-|i\\rangle|^2\\ } [ \\delta(\\omega_{fi}-\\omega)+\\delta(\\omega_{fi}+\\omega ) ] , \\nonumber\\\\ im\\{\\sigma_{xy}\\}=\\frac{\\pi e^2}{4m^2v\\hbar\\omega}\\sum_{i , f } [ 1-f(\\varepsilon_f)]f(\\varepsilon_i ) \\{|\\langle f|\\pi_+|i\\rangle|^2- \\nonumber\\\\ - |\\langle f|\\pi_-|i\\rangle|^2\\ } [ \\delta(\\omega_{fi}-\\omega)+\\delta(\\omega_{fi}+\\omega)],\\label{kubo_formula}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 are the momentum operators in circular basis .",
    "the real part of the diagonal optical conductivity is proportional to the joint density of states for the occupied and unoccupied states multiplied by the electric dipole matrix elements , therefore , it describes the absorption of light for left and right circularly polarized photons in average . on the other hand , the off - diagonal conductivity is the difference between the absorption spectra corresponding the two circular polarizations .",
    "contributions from electric dipole processes to off - diagonal optical conductivity are remarkable in ferromagnetic materials  due to the orbital magnetization induced by the spontaneous spin polarization via the spin - orbit interaction  similarly to the anomalous hall effect in the dc limit .     and an e@xmath57 band .",
    "the hybridization between the selenium and chromium induce a gap just below the fermi energy and a holes appears in the majority spin channel .",
    "the arrows indicate the excitations observed both in the diagonal and off - diagonal conductivity spectra with the same labels as used in fig .  1 and 3.,width=316 ]    to understand the origin of the optical excitations ,",
    "the results of the recent band structure calculations@xcite are summarized schematically in fig .",
    "the chromium d - band is split by the cubic crystal field to a t@xmath58 and an e@xmath57 band .",
    "the selenium 4p and the copper 3d states are fully mixed with each other . furthermore , the hybridization between the selenium 4p and the chromium t@xmath58 induces a gap just below the fermi energy in the majority spin channel . as a consequence ,",
    "states from the se 4p band are shifted above the fermi level ( referred to as `` hump in the density of states '' in the introduction ) , thus holes appears in the majority spin channel .",
    "the main optical transitions observed in the experiments are also indicated in the figure .",
    "our optical and magneto - optical study confirms the results of the band structure calculations both in the close vicinity of the fermi energy and on a few ev large scale . in agreement with the theoretical results",
    ", we explain the transition at @xmath2@xmath5@xmath6ev as excitations trough the hybridization induced gap .",
    "the high oscillator strength is due to the parity difference between the initial and the final states .",
    "the large off - diagonal conductivity is possibly owing to the strong spin - orbit coupling for the delocalized electrons with strong selenium character ( e@xmath59@xmath3@xmath6ev ) and the highly spin polarized states in the @xmath601ev vicinity of the fermi level.@xcite the first charge transfer excitations around @xmath2@xmath5@xmath21ev , with a remarkable oscillator strength and magneto - optical activity are attributed to se 4p@xmath20cr 3d transition , while the excitation at @xmath2@xmath5@xmath22ev is assigned to on - site d - d transitions of chromium ions .",
    "these are in overall agreement with the numerical calculations , although the transition energies are somewhat higher in the experiment .",
    "@xcite the contribution of the d - d transition to the off - diagonal conductivity is small compared to that of the charge transfer transition . besides the reduced oscillator strength of the d - d transition due to its dipole forbidden nature ,",
    "it is likely caused by the fairly small spin - orbit coupling for chromium ( e@xmath59@xmath5@xmath61ev ) .",
    "@xcite    the measurement of the off - diagonal conductivity greatly helps to extract the optical transition found around @xmath2@xmath5@xmath6ev since its large magneto - optical activity dominates over the contribution from the metallic charge carriers ( damped cyclotron resonance ) contrary to the case of the diagonal conductivity .",
    "we have measured the reflectivity and magneto - optical kerr effect over a broad energy range ( e=0.08 - 26ev and e=0.1 - 4ev , respectively ) at various temperatures down to t=10k and evaluated the elements of the optical conductivity tensor .",
    "the diagonal and off - diagonal optical conductivity spectra determined from the experiments are consistent with the results of former band structure calculations@xcite over the whole energy region . at low energies",
