    "the maximum of the peak weakly shifts to higher temperature when the field is increased from 0 to @xmath150koe . this weak increase is a consequence of the perpendicular orientation of the external magnetic field with respect to the exchange field arising from @xmath151 .",

    "figure  [ fig6]d displays the thermal expansion of tbmno@xmath2  in zero field along the @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath11 axes . the transitions at @xmath40  and @xmath160  cause anomalies of @xmath1 along all three crystallographic directions , which are discussed in detail in ref .  .",
    "in addition , for all three directions broad schottky contributions of different signs are present around @xmath25  k , which originate from the @xmath3 states of tb@xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath166 state of the free tb@xmath46 ion splits into @xmath167 singlets in an orthorhombic cf . to our knowledge ,",
    "the @xmath3 energy level scheme of tb@xmath46 in tbmno@xmath2is not known@xcite and we are not aware of any investigations of the crystal - field splitting of related tb@xmath54o@xmath2 compounds .",
    "thus , a detailed analysis of this schottky contribution to @xmath1 is not possible . as a rough estimate of the relevant energy scale a fit of the thermal expansion data by equation  ( [ equ_alphasch ] )",
    "yields an effective energy gap of @xmath168 .",
    "the comparison of the thermal conductivity with the thermal expansion data shows that the extrema of @xmath34occur close to the minimum of @xmath0 .",
    "this correlation strongly suggests that the minimum of @xmath26 at @xmath169  is caused by resonant scattering of phonons between different cf levels of tb@xmath46 .",
    "such an interpretation is further supported by the magnetic - field dependencies of @xmath26 . for @xmath31 and @xmath27 ,",
    "@xmath26 is suppressed over a broad temperature range , whereas it is enhanced for @xmath32 .",
    "these large field dependencies up to high temperatures are rather unusual , and clearly not related to the low - temperature ordering phenomena below @xmath170 .",
    "the influence of the various transitions below 41  k on @xmath26 is weak .",
    "we only observe small dips at the transition temperatures @xmath40  and @xmath160as indicated by the arrows in fig .",
    "the shape of the thermal conductivity curves remains essentially unchanged .",
    "we conclude that these ordering transitions play little role for @xmath26 , since the low @xmath26 is completely dominated by the scattering of phonons by the @xmath3 cf levels of tb@xmath46 .    below @xmath160  additional magnetic - field dependencies",
    "are observed .",
    "one can distinguish the measurements with @xmath32 or @xmath21 , where the lti - to - ltc transition occurs , from those with @xmath27 , where the system turns into the paraelectric phase for sufficiently large fields .",
    "for the latter case , a sharp increase of @xmath26 is observed when the paraelectric phase is reached , see fig .",
    "the pronounced hysteresis of the @xmath25  koe curve reflects the first - order nature of this transition .",
    "apart from the different transition temperatures , the curves for @xmath25  koe and @xmath171  koe are almost identical . for @xmath172",
    ", @xmath26 increases at the lti - to - ltc transition ( @xmath173  k ; see fig .",
    "[ fig6]b ) .",
    "although this field dependence is of opposite sign compared to the high - temperature field dependence for @xmath31 , it is difficult to separate both effects , because the scattering by the cf levels of tb@xmath46 probably causes a magnetic - field dependence of @xmath0 down to the lowest temperature . since the lti - to - ltc",
    "transition is accompanied by a polarization flop from @xmath162 to @xmath161 , one may suspect that the increase of @xmath26 is related to the formation of ferroelectric domains .",
    "we have , however , ruled out this possibility by measurements of the electrical polarization as well as of the thermal conductivity under application of large electrical fields ( not shown ) . although the domain formation could be clearly seen in the polarization measurements , no electric - field influence was detectable in @xmath0 .",
    "thus , another explanation for the suppressed thermal conductivity in the lti phase is needed . probably , it is the incommensurability itself , which causes an additional thermal resistance , because the crystal symmetry is lowered in the lti phase .",
    "accordingly , one should expect a similar behavior for @xmath32 , but the broadening of the lti - to - ltc transition due to its large hysteresis@xcite and the superimposed high - temperature field dependence prevent a separation of the different effects at low temperatures .",
    "the incommensurability is also consistent with the jump of @xmath0 for @xmath27 , since the paraelectric phase is commensurate and therefore of higher symmetry .",
    "we have studied the thermal expansion and thermal conductivity of ndmno@xmath2  and tbmno@xmath2  under application of large magnetic fields .",
    "the thermal conductivity of ndmno@xmath2  is a very unusual .",
    "the nel transition at @xmath40@xmath42  leads to a strong suppression of the phonon thermal conductivity over a large temperature range .",
    "including a magnetic scattering rate proportional to the magnetic specific heat allows us to describe the thermal conductivity from @xmath40  to room temperature . at low temperatures",
    "the thermal conductivity is further suppressed by another scattering mechanism .",
    "the @xmath3 ground - state doublet of nd@xmath46 is split ( @xmath174 ) by an exchange interaction with the canted mn moments .",
    "our analysis suggests a significant enhancement of the mn canting angle in ndmno@xmath2  compared to that in prmno@xmath2  as a consequence of this nd - mn interaction .",
    "the splitting of the ground - state doublet thereby allows for resonant scattering of phonons which causes the additional suppression of @xmath0 in zero field .",
    "the analysis of the thermal expansion in magnetic fields up to @xmath24  koe reveals that @xmath103 strongly increases in magnetic fields @xmath27 .",
    "this increase of @xmath103 shifts the effectiveness of the resonant scattering processes towards higher temperature and causes a drastic increase of @xmath0 at low temperatures . for @xmath27 , with increasing temperature a gradual change occurs leading to a suppression of @xmath0 .",
    "a similar suppression is present for @xmath32 and @xmath31 in the entire low - temperature range .",
    "this requires the presence of a second field - dependent scattering mechanism , which may be related to scattering of phonons either by magnons or by higher - lying cf levels .",
    "tbmno@xmath2  also exhibits a strongly suppressed thermal conductivity over the entire temperature range .",
    "the clear correlation of the temperature dependencies of @xmath0 and of the uniaxial thermal expansion coefficients @xmath1 enables us to conclude that the dominant mechanism suppressing @xmath0 is resonant scattering of phonons by the @xmath3 cf levels of tb@xmath46 .",
    "the interpretation of ref .   that the low absolute values of the thermal conductivity of tbmno@xmath2  should be caused by the complex magnetic and electric ordering phenomena",
    "is ruled out by our data .",
    "in contrast , the complex transitions of tbmno@xmath2  only cause very weak anomalies in @xmath0 at @xmath40  and @xmath160 .",
    "a somewhat larger influence is present at the transitions induced by finite magnetic fields .",
    "the lti - to - ltc transition for @xmath175 as well as the transition to the paraelectric phase for @xmath27 cause an increase of the thermal conductivity . probably , this increase of @xmath0 arises from the incommensurability of the lti phase , which is transformed to a commensurate phase of higher symmetry for all three field directions .",
    "we also found that the ferroelectric domain structure has no measurable influence on the heat transport in tbmno@xmath2 ."
