    "we considered the influence of slow random motion of random scatterers on the localization of quantum particles .",
    "it turned out that whenever the states of the quantum particles were localized , under the assumption , that the same scatterers are _ static _ , taking the motion of the scatterers into account leads to a finite value of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "in particular , for the three dimensional case , there exists a narrow crossover region in energy space , which separates the states with high and low diffusion coefficient , the latter being inversely proportional to the dephasing time .",
    "( for the states with fast diffusion the dephasing is irrelevant . ) like the position of the mobility edge in the case of static scatterers , the position of this crossover region is determined by the criterion that the mean free path is of the order of the quantum particle wavelength .",
    "this crossover region we call the quasi - mobility edge , and the phenomena in general we call quasi - localization . for the two dimensional case",
    "we have a transition between weak localization , observed when the dephasing length is less than the localization length ( calculated for static scatterers ) , and strong localization observed in the opposite case .    the main application of our results we see as lying in the description of kinetics of ultracold gases .",
    "however , we would like to mention possible application of these results to at least one other field . in our previous publication @xcite",
    ", we studied the influence of dephasing on the anderson localization of the electrons in magnetic semiconductors , driven by spin fluctuations of magnetic ions . there the role of heavy particles was played by magnons ; complete spin polarization of conduction electrons prevented magnon emission or absorption processes , and only the processes of electron - magnon scattering being allowed ."
