    "since the first brown dwarfs were discovered two decades ago becklin88 , nakajima95 , hundreds more brown dwarfs have been discovered using wide field infrared surveys .",
    "these substellar objects , too low in mass to fuse hydrogen in their cores , range in mass from @xmath4 13 to 75 @xmath5  and are classified by their spectra into l , t , and most recently y dwarfs kirkpatrick05 , cushing11 . without hydrogen fusion as an internal energy source , brown dwarfs never reach a main - sequence state of constant luminosity ; instead , they cool over time and will transition through the brown dwarf spectral sequence as different molecules and condensates form in their atmospheres . to model their atmospheres accurately",
    "requires an understanding of both the chemistry and physics of the materials that will condense into clouds .",
    "grain or condensate formation has been predicted to play an important role in l dwarf atmospheres since before the first brown dwarfs were discovered lunine86 , lunine89 .",
    "modern equilibrium thermochemical models predict that a variety of different condensates will form in l dwarf atmospheres fegley94",
    ", lodders99 ; by comparing models to observations , it is now well - established that a variety of refractory materials condense in l dwarfs [ see , e.g.][]tsuji96 , allard01,marley02,burrows06,cushing08 .",
    "the condensates that appear to dominate , based on the abundances of elements available to condense , are corundum ( al@xmath0o@xmath6 ) , iron ( fe ) , enstatite ( mgsio@xmath6 ) , and forsterite ( mg@xmath0sio@xmath7 ) , and these species form cloud layers , removing atoms found within the clouds from the lower pressure atmosphere above fegley96 , lodders02 , lodders03 , lodders06 , visscher10 . within windows between major molecular absorption bands , there is little gas opacity so , in models without clouds , the emergent flux comes from hotter layers deep within the atmosphere .",
    "cloud opacity tends to suppress the flux in the near - infrared within these windows ; a thick cloud layer limits the depth from which the planet can radiate , removing some of the flux at these wavelengths , and forcing it to other wavelengths am01 .",
    "when the opacity of these clouds is included in radiative - convective equilibrium models of brown dwarf atmospheres , the resulting model spectra match those of observed l dwarfs cushing06 , cushing08 , saumon08 , stephens09 .",
    "observations show that there is a range of colors for a given spectral type , which are believed to be associated with cloud variations or metallicity , but the details of this are not fully understood .",
    "regardless , observed colors and spectra of l dwarfs can not be well - matched without a significant cloud layer burrows06 .      as a brown dwarf continues to cool , it undergoes a significant transformation in its observed spectrum when it reaches an effective temperature of approximately 1400 k. objects cooler than this transitional effective temperature begin to show methane absorption features in their near - infrared spectra and , when these features appear , are classified as t dwarfs burgasser02 , kirkpatrick05 . within a small range of effective temperature ,",
    "the iron and silicate clouds become dramatically less important .",
    "marley10 show that this transition could potentially be explained by the breaking up of these cloud layers into patchy clouds , but the details of the transition are still very much unknown .",
    "however , the recent discovery of highly photometrically variable early t dwarfs suggests that cloud patchiness may indeed play a role radigan12 , artigau09 .",
    "regardless , as the clouds dissipate , the atmospheric windows in the near - infrared clear .",
    "flux emerges from deeper , hotter atmospheric layers , and the brown dwarf becomes much bluer in @xmath8 color ( see figure [ intro - colormag ] )",
    ".      the first t dwarf discovered , gl229b nakajima95 , oppenheimer95 , was modeled by marley96 , allard96 , fegley96 , and tsuji96 using cloud - free models .",
    "these models assume that the condensate - forming materials have been removed from the gas phase , but do not contribute to the cloud opacity .",
    "early t dwarfs are generally quite well - modeled using cloudless atmospheric models . however , recent observations of cooler t dwarfs suggest that t dwarfs of type t8 or later ( @xmath1@xmath9 800 k ) appear to be systematically redder in @xmath8 and @xmath10 colors than the cloudless models predict ( see figure [ intro - colormag ] )",
    ".    one of the challenges of modeling brown dwarf spectra is the uncertainties in the absorption bands of major gas species such as methane and ammonia , as well as absorption due to collisional processes .",
    "recent work by saumon12 has modeled a range of brown dwarfs using improved line lists for ammonia from yurchenko11 and an improved treatment of the pressure - induced opacity of h@xmath0 collisions from richard12 .",
    "this work improves the accuracy of model near - infrared spectra and reddens the @xmath8 colors of the model spectra with effective temperatures between 500 and 1500 k. the color shift is due to decreased opacity in @xmath11 band from collision - induced absorption and , for @xmath1@xmath9 500 k model only , increased ammonia opacity in @xmath12 band .",

    "helling and collaborators helling06 also recognized that some of these species will form condensates in some cases but also did not compute model atmospheres that included this opacity source .",
    "fortney05c noted that some of these species might be detectable in extrasolar planet transit spectra which probe a longer path length through the atmosphere .",

    ", we do not include the opacity of iron , silicate , and corundum clouds ; based on observed trends , we assume that the opacity of these clouds becomes negligible for the early t dwarfs .",
    "we instead include cr , mns , na@xmath0s , zns , and kcl .",
    "the am01 approach avoids treating the highly uncertain microphysical processes that create clouds in brown dwarf and planetary atmospheres .",
    "instead , it aims to balance the advection and diffusion of each species vapor and condensate at each layer of the atmosphere .",
    "it balances the upward transport of vapor and condensate by turbulent mixing in the atmosphere with the downward transport of condensate by sedimentation .",
    "this balance is achieved using the equation    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the vertical eddy diffusion coefficient , @xmath17 is the mixing ratio of condensate and vapor , @xmath18 is the mixing ratio of condensate , @xmath19 is the convective velocity scale , and @xmath3  is a parameter that describes the efficiency of sedimentation in the atmosphere .",
    "this calculation provides the total amount of condensate at each layer of the atmosphere .",
    "the distribution of particle sizes at each level of the atmosphere is represented by a log - normal distribution in which the modal particle size is calculated using the sedimentation flux .",

    "the cloud models will therefore be only minimally affected by the changes in the pressure - temperature profile of the atmosphere due to the changes in gas opacity .",
    "however , the overall spectra of models will look quite different in regions where co absorbs strongly , such as the 4.5  feature , so future , more comprehensive fits of sulphide cloud models to observations will have to include non - equilibrium models .",
    "clouds must form in brown dwarf atmospheres as they cool ; there is no way to avoid the condensation of different species as the atmosphere reaches lower effective temperatures . in these models ,",
    "we parameterize the opacity of clouds by creating a distribution of cloud material in the atmosphere which has a distribution of cloud particle sizes . within the models",
    ", we can change those distributions .",
    "a cloud that sediments into a small number of large particles will settle into a thin layer and will not significantly change the emergent spectrum ; the same cloud material organized into an extended cloud with small particle sizes will have a dramatic effect on the model spectrum .",
    "for these reasons , we require a model of cloud particle sizes and distribution as well as the underlying chemistry .",
    "when we consider models that include new or different clouds , we do not change any of the underlying chemistry of condensation ; we change the opacity of the condensate particles and in doing so modify the effect that the cloud formation has on emergent flux .",
    "burgasser10 invoked the reemergence of silicate clouds to explain the spectrum of ross 458c .",
    "we suggest instead that the initial emergence of sulfide clouds would have a similar effect on the spectrum and provide a more natural explanation for the results .    from observations ,",
    "it is clear that the range in t dwarf colors just following the l / t transition is small ; spectra of t dwarfs show no evidence that clouds still affect the emergent flux for objects slightly cooler than this transition .",
    "this observation suggests that the iron and silicate clouds have dissipated between 1400 and 1200 k ( for typical field dwarfs ) and are no longer important in t dwarf atmospheres .",
    "if iron and silicate clouds were sometimes important in t dwarf atmospheres , we would expect to see a population of relatively quite red objects at effective temperatures between that of ross 458c and the l dwarfs ; no brown dwarf with these properties has been observed .    as t dwarfs cool , the range in observed infrared colors increases ; a population of red t dwarfs develops , which are redder in the near - infrared than cloudless models predict . based on these observations ,",
    "we favor a mechanism that can not strongly alter @xmath1@xmath4900 - 1200 k t dwarf atmospheres , but naturally reddens @xmath1@xmath9800 k t dwarfs .",
    "the emergence of sulfide clouds provides that natural explanation for this range in t dwarf colors at low effective temperatures .",
    "just as the iron and silicate clouds condense in the photospheres of l dwarfs and change their observed spectra , the sulfide clouds begin to condense in the photospheres of t dwarfs with temperatures cooler than 900 k , changing their observed spectra .",
    "we have not yet investigated whether the sulfide clouds will have identifiable spectral features that would confirm their presence in t dwarf atmospheres , but given the features in the sulfide indices of refraction ( see figure [ na2s_n ] ) these features would likely be in the mid - infrared .",
    "there are several challenges in modeling t dwarfs that have not yet been addressed in these calculations .",
    "because of the high densities in brown dwarf atmospheres , sodium and potassium bands at optical wavelengths are extremely pressure - broadened in t dwarf spectra tsuji99 , burrows00 , allard05 , allard07 .",
    "the wings of these broadened bands extend into the near - infrared in @xmath85 and @xmath12 bands , creating additional opacity at those wavelengths .",
    "for these calculations , we use the line broadening treatment outlined in burrows00 , which is somewhat _ ad hoc _ and potentially creates some inaccuracies in the model flux in @xmath85 and @xmath12 bands .",
    "a calculation of the molecular potentials for potassium and sodium in these high pressure environments , as is carried out in allard05 , allard07 , would improve the accuracy of these models .",
    "another challenge in modeling t dwarf spectra is the inadequacies of methane opacity calculations ; methane is the only important gas - phase absorber with inadequate opacity measurements or calculations .",
    "uncertainties in methane absorption bands create inaccuracies in t dwarf models , especially in @xmath13 band where it is a very strong absorber saumon12 .",
    "sulfide clouds could form partial cloud layers with patchy clouds .",
    "one way to infer patchy cloud cover is to observe variability in photometric colors ; variability can indicate high - contrast cloud features rotating in and out of view .",
    "radigan12 studied objects at the l / t transition and inferred that the iron and silicate clouds could be in the process of breaking up and forming patchy clouds in those atmospheres .",
    "a similar study of the variability of cool t dwarfs could reveal a similar physical process in sulfide clouds .      a larger number of high fidelity spectra of the coldest t dwarfs would help to constrain these cloudy models .",
    "currently there are a few objects with effective temperatures cooler than 700 k with moderate resolution spectra .",
    "a larger sample of objects would give us better statistics on the overall population of t dwarfs , with different surface gravities , metallicities , and cloud structures .      at cooler effective temperatures",
    ", water clouds will condense in brown dwarf atmospheres burrows03 .",
    "oxygen is 300 times more abundant than sodium in a solar - composition gas and the silicate clouds only use 20% of the total oxygen in the atmosphere , so water clouds will be much more massive and important in shaping the emergent flux . as missions like wise find colder objects kirkpatrick11 , cushing11 and these objects are observed spectroscopically , future models of brown dwarfs will need to include the condensation of these more volatile clouds .",
    "before the water clouds condense , lodders99 , lodders06 predict that rbcl and cscl will condense ; however , the abundances of cs and rb are very low lodders03 so these clouds will be optically thin .",
    "if equilibrium conditions prevail , nh@xmath7h@xmath0po@xmath7 would also condense fegley94 , visscher06 with a mass similar to that of the na@xmath0s  cloud . whether nh@xmath7h@xmath0po@xmath7 condenses or p remains in the gas phase as ph@xmath6 ( as on jupiter and saturn ) deserves further study to examine potential effects on the spectra of the coolest brown dwarfs .",
    "observations and models of t dwarfs provide a testbed to study planetary atmospheres . while brown dwarfs are more massive than planets , the atmospheres of t dwarfs have similar effective temperatures to those of young giant planets burrows97,fortney08b .",
    "the study of t dwarfs provides crucial tests of cloudy atmosphere models that will be applicable to directly - imaged exoplanet atmospheres .",
    "cloud models designed originally for brown dwarfs are already being applied to exoplanets .",
    "cloud models with iron and silicate clouds were originally developed to model l dwarf atmospheres ; these models have been successfully applied to observations of the only directly imaged multiple planet system , hr 8799 .",
    "several studies of the hr 8799 planets have shown that the iron and silicate clouds play a significant role in their atmospheres marois08 , barman11 , galicher11 , bowler10 , currie11 , madhu11c , marley12 .",
    "as instruments like the gemini planet imager and sphere begin to discover new planets in the next few years , we will be able to apply brown dwarf models to colder planetary atmospheres in which clouds will likely play a key role in shaping their spectra .",
    "cloud formation is a natural and unavoidable phenomenon in cool substellar atmospheres . at temperatures cooler than those of l dwarfs",
    ", chemistry dictates that additional condensates , beyond the silicates and iron , must form .",
    "we have examined the effect of including the most abundant of these lower - temperature condensates , cr , mns , na@xmath0s , zns , and kcl , in brown dwarf model atmospheres . within the framework of the am01 cloud model",
    ", we have investigated the opacity of these clouds over a wide range of parameter space , across the relevant range of t dwarfs , to the warmest y dwarfs . from our suite of models from 400 to 1300 k , log @xmath2=4.0 to 5.5 , @xmath3=2 to 5 ,",
    "we have shown the likely role that these low-@xmath1  clouds , dominated by sulfides , play in these cool atmospheres .",
    "model spectra were compared to two t dwarfs , ross 458c and ugps 072205 .",
    "these two objects have red near - infrared colors and are not well - matched by cloudless models .",
    "model spectra that include the sulfide clouds match the observed spectra of both objects more accurately than cloudless models .    the photometric colors of the cloudy models were calculated and compared to the full population of brown dwarfs with parallax measurements .",
    "this analysis shows that the sulfide clouds provide a mechanism to match the near - infrared colors of observed brown dwarfs .",
    "the agreement is particularly good in @xmath10 , while in @xmath8 the models are somewhat too red .",
    "wise observations of the coolest t dwarfs and warmest y dwarfs indicate the these new models fit observations better than cloud - free models .",
