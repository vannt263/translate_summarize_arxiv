    "the tevatron @xmath1 collider operates at a center - of - mass energy @xmath2 tev .",
    "top quarks are produced mainly strongly in pairs and , within the standard model ( sm ) , decay almost exclusively into a @xmath3 boson and a @xmath4-quark via the weak interaction .",
    "therefore , any deviation in the v - a structure of the @xmath5 decay or evidence for more exotic final states would be indicative of new physics .",
    "both the cdf and dcollaborations study the detailed kinematics of the products from @xmath5 decay and search for non - sm contributions .",
    "these will be summarized in this report .",
    "the helicity of the @xmath3 bosons in top decays is defined by the v - a structure of the @xmath6 vertex and can be accessed through the kinematics of the @xmath3 decay products .",
    "the alignment of the @xmath3 spin can be characterized by the angle  @xmath7 between the @xmath3 momentum vector in the top quark rest frame and the momentum of the down - type fermion in the @xmath3 rest frame .",
    "the sm predicts the fraction of longitudinally polarized @xmath3 bosons to be @xmath8 , the fraction of left - handed @xmath3s @xmath9 , while the right - handed fraction @xmath10 is greatly suppressed by the v - a structure of the decay .    the cdf collaboration has performed three independent measurements of the longitudinal @xmath11 and right - handed @xmath10 fractions of the helicity of the @xmath3 boson using lepton @xmath12 jets events with at least one secondary - vertex tag ( @xmath4-tag ) in 1.9  fb@xmath0 of data .",
    "the first method relies on the matrix element technique  @xcite . in this measurement , the fractions",
    "are set to @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the two other techniques focus on measuring the @xmath15 distribution in kinematically reconstructed @xmath16 final states . in one case (  unfolding technique \" )",
    "the observed @xmath15 distribution is corrected by subtracting the background and accounting for bin - to - bin migration of @xmath16 events from true to reconstructed values of @xmath15 . in the other analysis (  template method \" ) templates of @xmath17 for @xmath16 with different @xmath3 polarizations and backgrounds after event reconstruction are fitted to the data .",
    "both analyses perform 1-parameter fits ( fixing @xmath11 or @xmath10 to their sm values ) and 2-parameter fits by simultaneously extracting the @xmath11 and @xmath10 fractions .",
    "the results of these two analyses have been further combined using the blue technique  @xcite .",
    "the summary of cdf results is presented in table  [ tab : whel ] .",
    "the dcollaboration measures the @xmath3 polarization using the template technique in 2.7 fb@xmath0 of data in both dilepton and lepton @xmath12 jets event topologies .",
    "the lepton @xmath12 jets events are fully reconstructed , and the information in the @xmath18 decays is also sampled by randomly picking the down - type quark as one of the jets associated with the @xmath3 boson .",
    "dileptons are reconstructed within their eight - fold ambiguity , and the average of @xmath15 for all solutions is used in the extraction of helicity .",
