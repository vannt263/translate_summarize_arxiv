    "a bipartite quantum system is considered separable if it can be written as @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are individual partial density matrices .",
    "a system that can not be factored into the form above is said to be entangled . in practice ,",
    "determining whether a general @xmath0 bipartite system can be factored into the form above is very hard .",
    "thus , several tests have been introduced in order to determine whether a system is entangled .",
    "one test originates from quantum information theory , and it relies on calculating conditional entropies .",
    "conditional entropy indicates the entropy of one subsystem after measuring the other , and it is given by : @xmath11 a bipartite system with at least one degree of freedom having negative conditional entropy is entangled .",
    "therefore a necessary condition for separability is that the conditional entropies are positive .",

    ", @xcite relies on partial transposition .",
    "partial transposition is a blockwise transposition of a matrix and it is given by : @xmath16 a system whose partially transposed density matrix is negative is entangled .",
    "therefore a necessary condition for separability is the positivity of the partially transposed density matrix ( the horodecki s @xcite showed that it is also a sufficient condition for separability of @xmath0 systems with @xmath17 ) .",
    "kraus and coworkers @xcite analyzed systems supported on @xmath18 .",
    "they gave necessary and sufficient conditions for separability of systems with positive partially transposed ( ppt ) density matrices .",
    "they showed that if the rank of density matrix is equal to @xmath19 , the density matrix is separable .",
    "however , other criteria they devised are very complicated to implement for a generic density matrix .",
    "the jcm is the simplest fully quantum model that describes the interaction between light and matter .",
    "the model consists of a single quantized two level atom interacting with a single quantized electromagnetic cavity mode under the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) and the dipole approximation .",
    "the resonant jcm hamiltonian @xcite in the interaction representation is given by : @xmath20 for a system that starts in a pure state partial entropies of the field and the atom are equal at all times for a system that starts in a pure state @xcite .",
    "as already indicated above , this result is a consequence of the equality between the eigenvalues of the partial density matrices in a bipartite system , which in turn is a consequence of the schmidt decomposition .",
    "since the partial entropies fluctuate together in time , their sum does not conserve the total entropy .",
    "@xmath21 thus , in this case partial entropies are not an additive ( extensive ) quantity . nevertheless ,",
    "knowledge of partial entropies gives information about the dynamics of the total system .",
    "the question that we address here is whether we can find states of light and matter for which the partial entropies are quasi - additive .",
    "mixed states of light and matter can be natural candidates in this respect .",
    "we consider various combinations of initial pure and mixed states of light and matter .",
    "the mixed state for the electromagnetic field is chosen to be a planck distribution for a single cavity mode : @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the average number of photons in the cavity .",
    "the mixed state for the atom has the following general form : @xmath24 .",
    "when the cavity mode is in exact resonance with the atomic transition , one can derive an analytic expression for the propagator and obtain analytic expressions for the full and partial density matrices at any time . the general solution for the full density matrix",
    "has the following form : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the interaction hamiltonian mentioned above . by expanding @xmath27 in a taylor series one obtains the analytic form of the propagator : @xmath28 to simulate the evolution of the entropic quantities , we truncated the set of fock states that compose the planck distribution at some @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "the accuracy of the results we obtained was tested by adding more fock states to the planck distribution to see if the simulated values changed .",

    "[ fig1 ] the changes in atomic and field partial entropies ( @xmath33 ) vs. the dimensionless quantity @xmath34 are plotted . in fig.1a",
    "the atom is initially excited and the field is in a weakly excited thermal state ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "this case is similar to a situation where both the field and atom are initially in a pure state , because both partial entropies rise and lower together ( although they are not equal ) . in fig .",
    "1b the atom is initially in the ground state and the field is in a weakly excited thermal state .",
    "it is clear that there is entropy exchange between the atom and field ( although the exchange is not complete ) .",
    "the sum of the field and atomic entropy changes ( green curve ) is quasi - conserved as seen by its amplitude of fluctuations , which is significantly smaller than each of the partial entropy changes .",
    "when the field is excited more , i.e. @xmath35 , or @xmath36 , no substantial entropy exchange between the atom and field occurs .",
    "in particular , when the field is highly excited ( @xmath37 ) and the atom is close to a pure state , there is a sharp and rapid collapse of the atomic purity ( sharp and rapid rise in the von neumann entropy ) with no substantial revival .    in order to determine which initial atomic states can exchange entropy with a weakly excited thermal field we considered different initial atomic states by discretizing the bloch sphere with a longitudinal angle ( @xmath38 , for positive @xmath39",
    "the atom is more excited ) and a bloch vector length ( @xmath40 ) , disregarding the azimuthal angle ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "we introduce a time averaged entropy exchange parameter defined by : @xmath42 where @xmath43 , and in the numerator the smaller of the two instantaneous partial entropy changes was substituted .",
    "the time averaged entropy exchange parameter is suitable for quantifying the extent of entropy flow between a weakly excited thermal field and an atom due to the oscillatory nature of the partial entropies .",
    "furthermore , the entropy exchange parameter is bounded : @xmath44 ; when it tends to @xmath45 there is high degree of entropy exchange , and when it tends to @xmath46 the two partial entropies rise and lower together .     and the bloch vector length @xmath47",

    "[ fig2 ] the entropy exchange parameter is plotted for a weakly excited thermal field and various initial atomic states .",
    "the dark blue region in parameter space is characterized by significant entropy exchange ( @xmath48 ) ; and in this region the atom is mostly in the ground state ( ground state probability is more than @xmath51 ) .",
    "thus entropy exchange occurs most effectively when the atom is initially close to the ground state .",
    "an example for an almost complete entropy exchange is given in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where the changes in atomic and field partial entropies are shown for an atom initially in the state @xmath52 ( @xmath50 ) . in this case the sum of the two partial entropies is almost completely conserved as seen by the amplitude of fluctuation of the sum of the partial entropy changes , which is two orders of magnitude smaller than each of the partial entropy changes .",
    "we now provide an analytical derivation for the entropy exchange effect .",
    "we first note that contours of significant entropy exchange ( @xmath48 , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) center around a point on the central vertical axis of the bloch sphere .",
    "this is a fixed point where the partial density matrices are stationary , and it corresponds to a situation where the field temperature is identical to the atomic boltzman temperature as we shall now show .",
    "consider a situation where : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the transition frequency .",
    "the full density matrix where both the atom and field are in mixed states ( with no initial coherence ) is given by : @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "the partial density matrices are in diagonal form : @xmath57 where @xmath58 by substituting equation [ ratios ] into equation [ mixeda ] one obtains : @xmath59 for example for a weakly excited thermal field with @xmath60 , this point is located at @xmath61 ( as indicated by the black arrow in fig .",

    "we now proceed to analyze the vicinity around the fixed point , where substantial entropy exchange occurs . for a weakly excited thermal field",
    "the atomic fixed point is close to the ground state ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we consider an initial state where an atom in the ground state interacts with a thermal cavity mode : @xmath62 . in this case",
    "the full density matrix is given by : @xmath63 where @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "the partial density matrices are in diagonal form : @xmath66 since the purity is qualitatively similar to the von neumann entropy we can analyze the time dependence of the partial purities .",
    "the time derivatives of the partial purities are given by : @xmath67 one can rearrange the time derivatives in equation [ dsrga ] in terms of @xmath68 multiplying sums of oscillatory functions . for a weakly excited thermal cavity ( @xmath69 ) the @xmath68 decrease by approximately an order of magnitude for every increment in either @xmath70 or @xmath71 . approximating the derivatives of the partial purities by the first non vanishing term ( @xmath72 )",
    "one obtains : @xmath73 the above approximation shows explicitly that there is entropy exchange between a weakly excited thermal cavity mode and an atom initially in the ground state .",
    "the leading terms in the time derivatives of the partial purities have the same functional dependence on time but with opposite signs .",
    "consider now an initial state of an excited atom interacting with a thermal cavity mode : @xmath74 . in this case",
    "the full density matrix is given by : @xmath75 where @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "again the partial density matrices are in diagonal form : @xmath78 the time derivatives of the partial purities are given by : @xmath79 rearranging the time derivatives in equation [ dsrgb ] in terms of @xmath68 , as in the case when the atom was initially in the ground state , and approximating them by the first non vanishing term ( @xmath80 ) one obtains : @xmath81 the above approximation shows that in this case the partial purities oscillate together in time .",
    "the leading terms in the time derivatives of the partial purities are identical .",
    "when the cavity mode is excited thermally with more photons , i.e. @xmath82 , the terms in the time derivatives of the partial purities rearranged according to @xmath68 no longer decrease by an order of magnitude as @xmath83 increase .",
    "now many terms contribute substantially to the partial entropy behavior ; since these terms are not identical in both degrees of freedom , observing entropy exchange becomes increasingly less probable as @xmath23 increases .",
    "we consider now the relationship between entropy correlations developed between the atom and field discussed in previous sections , and entanglement of the various atomic - field states .",
    "one would expect that as @xmath84 the system becomes separable .",
    "this is motivated by the following formula from statistical mechanics @xcite : @xmath85 if @xmath86 , then @xmath87 ( since the sum over the natural logarithm terms has to be zero ) .",
    "this means that the two subsystems are independent ( if @xmath88 then the two subsystems are weakly classically correlated ) . in regions of the bloch sphere where the entropy exchange is almost complete ( @xmath89 ) : @xmath90 the last two equalities hold since the combined atomic - field system begins to evolve from a separable state , and since the evolution is unitary , respectively .",
    "therefore , we would expect that in regions of the bloch sphere where the entropy exchange is almost complete , there should be minimal entanglement .",
    "we now proceed with comparing our measure for entropy exchange with various entanglement measures .    ) .",
    "the region in parameter space where @xmath91 ( dotted line ) encompasses the entire region of entropy exchange ( @xmath92 ) , but in addition includes significant area where there is no entropy exchange ( even regions with @xmath93 ; compare with fig .",
    "[ fig2]),width=302 ]    as discussed in the introduction , bipartite systems with excessive mutual entropy are entangled .",
    "we introduce an entanglement parameter @xmath94 based on the ratio between mutual entropy and partial entropies : @xmath95}\\label{r}\\ ] ] it follows from equation [ smutlim ] that @xmath96 , with @xmath97 being a sufficient condition for entanglement and conversely @xmath98 being a necessary condition for separability . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the time averaged entanglement parameter , @xmath99 , is plotted for different initial atomic states coupled to a weakly excited thermal field .",
    "the region in parameter space with @xmath91 ( bounded by a dashed line ) indicates that the _ necessary _ condition for separability is fulfilled for most of the evolution time .",
    "this region is large , occupying about 75% of the interior of the bloch sphere .",
    "it encompasses the entire region of entropy exchange ( @xmath100 ) , but in addition includes significant area where there is no entropy exchange ( even regions with @xmath93 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that @xmath101 is a _ necessary _ but not a _",
    "sufficient_condition for separability .",
    "although the region defined by this necessary condition is too broad to be informative , note that in cases where there is substantial entropy exchange as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , @xmath99 approaches zero in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .    ) and various atomic states .",
    "the region of atomic parameter space with substantial entropy exchange ( @xmath48 , bounded by a solid white line ) falls within the region with minimal entanglement parameter ( dark ) , which is dominated by anti - correlated partial entropies.,width=302 ]    we consider now the ppt test , where the existence of even a single negative eigenvalue of the partially transposed density matrix is a _ sufficient _ criterion for entanglement . since the ppt test can only be applied for finite dimensional density matrices , in order to apply it to the jaynes - cummings model we need to truncate the infinite set of fock states .",
    "we do this according to the following procedure : @xmath102 in words , all residual probability from the truncation is placed in the @xmath103st state .",
    "the criterion for truncating the infinite set of fock states is that the partial entropies do not change by more than @xmath104 .",
    "we find that no matter what the initial state of the atom is , there is always at least one negative eigenvalue of the partially transposed density matrix .",
    "however , further investigation shows that this result is in essence due to the truncation of the infinite fock basis to a finite size .",
    "specifically , we find that in all regions of the bloch sphere there is always one negative eigenvalue of extremely small magnitude whose size is on the order of the probabilities tail of the infinite fock basis that gets truncated . since our primary interest here is in the original and not in the truncated jaynes - cummings model , we are inclined to ignore this negative eigenvalue of extremely small magnitude and to interpret the test of partial transposition in terms of the remaining negative eigenvalues .",
    "the remaining negative eigenvalues are all of sizable magnitude and robust with respect to the size of the fock basis .    with that introduction ,",
    "we define @xmath105 as the largest ( in absolute value ) negative eigenvalue of the partially transposed density matrix , @xmath106 .",
    "we then introduce as an entanglement measure @xmath107 where the overbar signifies the time average . in figure [ fig5 ]",
    "we plot the entanglement parameter , @xmath108 , for different initial states for @xmath109 . clearly , there are two well - defined regions in atomic parameter space .",
    "the dark region corresponds to a single negative eigenvalue of @xmath106 on the order of @xmath110 .",
    "this region is characterized by marginal entanglement , corresponding in all likelihood to completely separable evolution in the untruncated jaynes - cummings model .",
    "notice that the region of atomic parameter space with substantial entropy exchange ( @xmath48 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , shown as a solid white line in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) falls precisely within the region with minimal entanglement parameter , @xmath108 .",
    "the lighter shade region in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] is characterized by two or more negative eigenvalues of @xmath106 .",
    "we believe that this region corresponds to significant entanglement in the original , untruncated jaynes - cummings model .",
    "this region is clearly orthogonal to that of the region of entropy exchange .",
    "we have explored entropy correlations between a quantized cavity mode and a single atom in the framework of the jcm by considering both pure and mixed atomic and field states . in particular",
    ", we explored the regime of entropy _ exchange _ between light and matter .",
    "we presented two qualitatively different entropy correlations .",
    "the first type of correlation is a case where both the atomic and field partial entropies fluctuate together in time .",
    "this is reminiscent of the case where both the atom and field start out in a pure state , and consequently their partial entropies are identical at all times .",
    "the second type of correlation is a case where the atomic and field partial entropies are anti - correlated .",
    "this implies that there is entropy exchange between the atom and the field . since",
    "substantial entropy exchange occurs when the field is in a weakly excited thermal state ( @xmath69 ) we introduced an entropy exchange parameter in order to determine which initial atomic states can efficiently exchange entropy with the field .",
    "substantial entropy exchange occurs when the atom is initially close to the ground state .",
    "we showed that contours of substantial entropy exchange center around a stationary point in the bloch sphere .",
    "this point corresponds to a situation where the initial field and atomic ( boltzman ) temperature exactly match . by analyzing the partial purities we derived an analytic approximation for the entropy exchange phenomenon .",
    "the change in the atomic and field partial purities have the same functional dependence on time but with opposite signs .",
    "it is natural to ask if there is any connection between the entropy exchange that we observe in this paper and a thermodynamic heat exchange process .",
    "although we can not rule out this possibility , we believe that the connection is unlikely . in classical thermodynamics , heat exchange is related to the transfer of energy that is in some sense degraded . in our case , because the entropy exchange is periodic and the system is small , there is no reason to believe a priori that the energy that is exchanged is unrecoverable for pure work .",
    "nevertheless , if one examines the ratio @xmath111 , where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the instantaneous rates of energy and entropy change of each subsystem respectively , there is some overall correlation with the initial temperature @xmath114 of the field , in agreement with the classical result @xmath115 .",
    "a well - established measure of entanglement is the test of negative eigenvalues of the partial transpose of the density matrix ( ppt test ) .",
    "unfortunately , the ppt test can not be applied directly to the jaynes - cummings model with its formally infinite hilbert space for the field .",
    "we therefore applied the ppt test to a model in which the infinite fock basis was truncated .",
    "we found that there is always at least one negative eigenvalue for the partially transposed density matrix .",
    "however , further investigation showed that this result is due to the truncation of the fock basis .",
    "since our primary interest here is in the original and not in the truncated jaynes - cummings model , we essentially discard this negative eigenvalue of extremely small magnitude and interpret the test of partial transposition in terms of only the remaining negative eigenvalues .",
    "we find that the region of the bloch sphere in which there are are no additional negative eigenvalues maps very closely onto the region where where there is substantial entropy exchange between atom and field .",
    "this result is intuitively appealing , showing a strong negative correlation between entropy exchange and entanglement .",
