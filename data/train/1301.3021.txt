    "the detection and parameter estimation of moving targets is one of the most important radar applications .",
    "the use of antenna arrays greatly improves our ability to perform this task .",
    "antenna arrays make it possible to estimate not only the range and doppler frequency , but also the azimuth of the target .",
    "furthermore , using multiple antennas can significantly increase signal strength and thus in turn can greatly enhance accuracy and our ability to locate low contrast targets ( `` faint '' or `` weak '' targets ) .",
    "therefore it does not come as a surprise that in recent years radar systems employing multiple antennas at the transmitter and the receiver ( also referred to as mimo radar , where mimo stands for multiple - input multiple - output ) have attracted enormous attention in the engineering and signal processing community . despite the significant resources that have been devoted to mimo radar , there exists fairly little rigorous mathematical theory for mimo radar that addresses fundamental questions , such as how many targets can be detected at which azimuth - range - doppler resolution and at what signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "existing theory focuses mainly on the detection of a single target  @xcite . only very recently , in the footsteps of compressive sensing , do we see the emergence of a rigorous mathematical theory for mimo radar that addresses the more realistic and more interesting case of multiple targets  @xcite .",
    "however , for the widely popular case of randomly spaced antennas , the mathematical theory is still in its infancy . in an independent and seemingly disparate line of research in radar",
    ", mathematicians and engineers have devoted substantial efforts to the design of radar transmission waveforms that satisfy a variety of desirable properties .",
    "the vast majority of this research has focused on single antenna radar systems , and it is a priori not clear if and how these waveforms can be utilized for mimo radar . in this paper",
    "we bring together these two independent areas of research , mimo radar with random antenna arrays and radar waveform design , by developing a rigorous mathematical framework for accurate target detection via random arrays , which at the same time utilizes some of the most attractive radar waveforms , such as kerdock codes .",
    "a radar system illuminates a region of interest in order to detect the location , velocity , and reflectivity of the objects ( targets ) in its field of view .",
    "we consider the following standard ( narrowband ) radar model  @xcite .",
    "suppose a target located at _ range _",
    "@xmath0 is traveling with _ constant velocity _ @xmath1 and has _",
    "reflection coefficient _ @xmath2 .",
    "suppose further just for the moment that we have only one target , one transmitter and one receiver ( in which case we can not detect direction ) .",
    "after transmitting signal @xmath3 , the receiver observes the reflected signal @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the round trip time of flight , @xmath6 is the speed of light , @xmath7 is the doppler shift , and @xmath8 is the carrier frequency .",
    "the basic idea is that the _ range - velocity _ information @xmath9 of the target can be inferred from the observed _ time delay - doppler shift _",
    "@xmath10 of @xmath11 in ( [ eq : radar_reflected_signal ] ) . for only one target",
    "this can be done conveniently by correlating the received signal @xmath12 with time - frequency shifted versions of the transmitted signal .",
    "since we are dealing with bandlimited signals , it suffices to consider discrete signals sampled at a properly chosen rate @xmath13 .",
    "it is therefore common practice to compute @xmath14 and then locate the largest value of @xmath15 in order to detect the target in the range - doppler domain .    in the presence of multiple targets",
    "more sophisticated methods are necessary . in order to resolve azimuth in addition",
    "to range and doppler , we need to employ an array of antennas .",
    "we assume an array of @xmath16 transmit and @xmath17 receiver antennas that are co - located ( also known as mono - static radar ) as illustrated in figure  [ fig : mimoradar ] .",
    "a more detailed description of the setup is postponed to section  [ s : setup ] .",
    "[ fig : mimoradar ]    the transmit antennas send simultaneously probing signals , which can differ from antenna to antenna and can be chosen to our specifications .",
    "it is convenient to divide the region of interest into range - azimuth - doppler cells corresponding to distance , direction and velocity , respectively .",
    "let @xmath18 be a measurement matrix whose columns correspond to the signal recorded at each receive antenna from a single unit - strength scatterer at a specific range - azimuth - doppler cell .",
    "let @xmath19 denote a vector whose elements represent the complex amplitudes of the scatterers .",
    "in many cases the radar scene is sparse in the sense that only a small fraction ( often a _ very _ small fraction ) of the cells is occupied by the objects of interest . in this case",
    "most of the entries of @xmath19 will be zero , but we do not know which ones , otherwise we would have located the targets already . with @xmath20",
    "representing a noise vector , we are faced with the linear system of equations @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a vector of measurements collected by the receive antennas over an observation interval .",
    "typically this system will be _ underdetermined _ , which implies that it will have infinitely many solutions .",
    "what comes to our rescue here is the sparsity of @xmath19 . while conventional radar processing techniques do not take full advantage of sparsity of the radar scene , the recent development of compressive sensing provides us with the possibility to optimally utilize this property  @xcite .",
    "the approach pursued in this paper to obtain a sparse solution of   is based on the lasso  @xcite , which gained tremendous popularity in connection with compressive sensing .",
    "the lasso solves @xmath23 where the parameter @xmath24 trades off goodness of fit with sparsity .    however , one of the main challenges in bringing compressive sensing theory into radar is that in radar the sensing matrix @xmath18 can not be freely chosen .",
    "its structure is dictated by the laws of physics on which radar is based .",
    "the crux is to carefully balance the desired resolution in the azimuth - range - doppler domain with the degrees of freedom at our disposal in the formation of @xmath18 , such as the antenna locations and the transmit waveforms .",
    "a great deal of work has been devoted in the mathematical and engineering literature to the design of radar transmission waveforms , see for instance  @xcite for a small sample of references .",
    "the design criteria for radar waveforms can be roughly split into two categories : ( i ) properties that are important from the viewpoint of hardware implementation , and ( ii ) properties that are relevant for target detection .",
    "waveforms that fall in the first category are for example polyphase sequences for some @xmath25 , see e.g.  @xcite . ] , since they give rise to signals with low peak - to - average power ratio is defined , up to different normalizations , as @xmath26 . ]",
    "a low papr is desirable in the digital - to - analog conversion of signals , since signals with large papr would require expensive power amplifiers .",
    "polyphase sequences also have the advantage that they can be very convientiently implemented in hardware via simple look - up tables .",
    "the second category usually includes waveforms with low auto - correlation and ( nearly ) ideal ambiguity function .",
    "quite a number of polyphase sequences , such as alltop sequences or kerdock codes , fall in this category . with the exception of  @xcite a rigorous mathematical theory concerning the benefits ( or even optimality ) of such sequences",
    "has only existed for the detection of a single target .",
    "common to all these carefully constructed sequences in both categories is that they have been designed for single - antenna radar systems and it is a priori not clear at all if any of these sequences are useful in exploiting the potential benefits of a mimo radar system .",
    "our paper provides two main contributions : ( i ) we derive the first rigorous mathematical theory for the detection of moving targets in the azimuth - range - doppler domain for random sensor arrays .",
    "( ii ) the transmitted waveforms satisfy a variety of properties that are very desirable and important from a practical viewpoint .",
    "in particular , we show that kerdock sequences , which would perform very poorly in single - antenna radar , are nearly ideally suited for mimo radar with randomly spaced antennas .",
    "since kerdock codes are polyphase sequences , they have excellent papr and they are easy to implement in hardware via a simple look - up table .",
    "thus , our framework does not just lead to useful theoretical insights , but also has a very strong practical appeal .",
    "random sensor arrays have been around for half a century .",
    "the pioneering work  @xcite by lo contains a mathematical analysis of important specific characteristics of random arrays , such as sidelope behavior and antenna gain .",
    "there is extensive engineering literature that deals with random arrays in connection with phased array radar technology , e.g.  see  @xcite .",
    "recently , carin made an explicit connection between the areas of random sensor arrays and compressive sensing  @xcite .",
    "he has shown that algorithms developed in these two seemingly different areas are in fact highly inter - related .",
    "the setup in @xcite is quite different from ours , since the paper is only concerned with angular resolution ( thus transmission waveforms do not even explicitly enter into the model ) , while it is often crucial in practice to be able to estimate range and doppler as well .",
    "moreover , the theoretical analysis in  @xcite follows more an engineering style and places less emphasis on mathematical rigor .",
    "the paper  @xcite provides interesting results for the angular estimation of stationary targets .",
    "its setup is similar to that in  @xcite , and quite different from ours , as it does not deal with waveform design nor with moving targets .",
    "kerdock codes have been proposed for radar in  @xcite .",
    "however in the setting of a single transmit antenna .",
    "kerdock codes are known to perform rather poorly .",
    "] even in the case of single targets as considered in  @xcite . only in the setting of",
    "mulitple transmit antennas can kerdock codes exhibit their enormous potential .",
    "our paper utilizes some properties of kerdock codes proved in  @xcite , but otherwise there is no overlap . in our paper",
    "we also present an extension of the main result , that allows for instance the use of the so - called finite harmonic oscillator system as transmission waveforms .",
    "these sequences have been derived in  @xcite , where the authors also briefly sketch their use in a single - antenna radar system for the simple case of a single target .",
    "thus , while our framework allows one to employ the finite harmonic oscillator system , there is essentially no overlap of our results with those in  @xcite .",
    "the paper @xcite ( coauthored by one of the authors ) is closest to this paper , but the setting is in a sense complementary .",
    "@xcite considers a mimo radar setting with a very specific ( non - random ) choice for the antenna locations , but random waveforms , while the current paper deals with randomly spaced antennas , but very specific , deterministic waveforms . at first glance",
    ", the difference may appear to be mainly semantic .",
    "but in practice , the second setting has many advantages . from an engineer s viewpoint",
    "random waveforms have several drawback over properly designed deterministic waveforms : they are much harder to implement on a digital device ( requiring more complicated hardware , more memory , ... ) ; and they exhibit a larger peak - to - average - power ratio . on the other hand it makes no difference from the viewpoint of physics or hardware , if we place the antennas at random or at deterministic locations . in particular",
    ", the current paper yields some important insights , which can not be inferred from  @xcite : we obtain a theoretical framework for radar operating with random antenna arrays , a technique which have been around for half a century ; we show that kerdock sequences , which are not useful for siso or simo radar , are excellent for mimo radar ; our approach allows for waveforms that satisfy a number of properties which are very desirable in practice , and are not satisfied by random waveforms . indeed , as mentioned above",
