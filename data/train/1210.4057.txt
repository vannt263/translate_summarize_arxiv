    "<S> conclusions_.  we have demonstrated that a majorana mode can be realized using the interplay of landau quantization and andreev reflection in a superconductor  topological - insulator hybrid structure . </S>",
    "<S> this mode is robust against disorder due to its chiral nature and associated uniqueness of the zero - energy state that is localized at the interface , and its velocity is tunable by adjusting the strength of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we have developed a theory to describe the coupling of this mode to other dirac - andreev edge states and showed how this coupling results in an energy - dependent electric charge for majorana - mode states . </S>",
    "<S> this feature should enable creation and manipulation of such excitations using external gate voltages .    _ </S>",
    "<S> acknowledgments_.  </S>",
    "<S> we acknowledge financial support by the swiss snf , the nccr nanoscience , and the nccr quantum science and technology . </S>"
