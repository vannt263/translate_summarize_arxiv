    "it has been known for some time that the effects of heavy dynamical fermions can be included in monte carlo simulations by a hopping parameter expansion of the fermion determinant .",
    "this is reminiscent of the euler - heisenberg lagrangian of perturbative qed , in which the effects of electron loops are included in a gauge - invariant effective lagrangian .",
    "recently hasenfratz and degrand @xcite have performed a zero - temperature calculation of the shift in the lattice gauge coupling constant @xmath6 , defined as @xmath7 , induced by staggered dynamical fermions and applied the result to the finite temperature phase transition in qcd .",

    "the diagrams contributing to the fermionic renormalization of @xmath13 are shown in fig .",

    "at finite temperature there are two independent symmetric tensors of order @xmath32 which are four - dimensionally transverse@xcite . in what follows",

    "the first of the corresponding lattice tensors is specified by @xmath33 @xmath34 and the second is @xmath35 where @xmath36 the lattice quantities @xmath37 are defined by @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40    the existence of these two independent tensors leads to separate renormalizations of the spatial and temporal gauge couplings at finite temperature .",
    "the first tensor , @xmath41 , is associated with the magnetic , or spatial , part of the action , while the second tensor , @xmath42 , is associated with the electric , or temporal , part of the action .",
    "we find that @xmath43 and @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 as the temperature is taken to zero , the two expressions smoothly approach each other to give the zero - temperature result .",
    "the integrals ( [ e2.3.8 ] ) and ( [ e2.3.9 ] ) were evaluated numerically by calculating mode sums for large values of @xmath47 and various values of @xmath48 .",
    "figure [ f4 ] compares @xmath49 per fermion ( spatial and temporal ) vs. @xmath5 for @xmath10 and @xmath50 with the zero temperature result of hasenfratz and degrand @xcite .",
    "the finite temperature values approach the zero temperature result from below as a consequence of the antiperiodic boundary conditions ; as @xmath48 increases , the sum includes more terms in the region near @xmath51 , which dominates for small @xmath9 . as might be expected , the temporal shift in @xmath6 is more sensitive to the effect of finite temperature than the spatial shift . for small values of @xmath5 ,",
    "corresponding to large values of the fermion mass , the effects of finite temperature are small .",
    "this is easily understood , since @xmath5 is much smaller than @xmath48 . however , for intermediate values of @xmath5 , finite temperature corrections ruin the excellent agreement between the zero - temperature calculation and the monte carlo results discussed in sec .",
    "[ s1 ] .      the connection between the the zero and finite temperature result can be understood more physically by transforming the sum over matsubara frequencies into a sum over images using the poisson summation formula for antiperiodic boundary conditions @xmath52 so that , for example , the shift in the spatial coupling is given by @xmath53 with a similar result for @xmath54 .",
    "this form has a simple physical interpretation : the first integral is the zero - temperature shift , and the integer @xmath55 in the second term labels the net number of times the fermion wraps around the lattice in the temporal direction .",
    "the finite temperature corrections result from the @xmath14 expansion of image diagrams such as those depicted in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] . numerically ,",
    "the dominant corrections to the zero - temperature result come from the first few values of @xmath55 , with the @xmath56 and @xmath57 terms accounting for more than @xmath58 of the finite temperature correction for @xmath59 .    although not apparent in our perturbative calculations , in order to maintain gauge invariance , the vertical segments of the image diagrams must be accompanied by powers of polyakov loops .",
    "it is an observed feature of simulations with dynamical fermions that the @xmath0 symmetry is approximately maintained in the low - temperature phase .",
    "this suggests that the image contibutions may be negligible below @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the zero temperature corrections to @xmath6 are suppressed nonperturbatively in the confined regime .",
    "in particular , just below @xmath1 the zero - temperature result will hold for @xmath49 .",
    "figure [ f6 ] illustrates an idealized behaviour for @xmath60 as a function of @xmath61 .",
    "there is another set of terms induced by the fermion determinant only at finite temperature . as is well known , the @xmath0 symmetry of the pure gauge theory is explicitly broken by dynamical fermions .",
    "to lowest order in the hopping parameter expansion , a path of @xmath48 hops around the lattice in the temporal direction produces a effective coupling to the polyakov loop , explicitly breaking the @xmath0 symmetry . evaluating the fermion determinant in a constant @xmath62 background field and applying the poisson summation formula [ eq .",
    "( [ e2.5.1 ] ) ] once again , we find an additional contribution to the effective action : @xmath63 \\label{e3.1}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 denotes a polyakov loop and the couplings @xmath65 are given by @xmath66 \\cos(nn_tq_0 ) \\label{e3.2}\\ ] ] this result can also be obtained by using a contour integral to evaluate the sum over matsubara frequencies .",
    "the leading term in this effective action has been discussed for the case @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "the maximum values of the @xmath65 are obtained when @xmath68 . for @xmath10",
    "we find @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and increasingly smaller magnitudes for higher order couplings . because @xmath71 favors @xmath0 breaking , it acts to lower the critical value of @xmath6 . unlike the @xmath72 term considered in sec .",
    "[ s2 ] , this effect can not be directly included as a finite shift in @xmath6 . the most direct way to determine",
    "the shift in @xmath6 due to @xmath71 term is to perform a monte carlo simulation of the pure gauge theory with an @xmath71 term added to the action .",
    "the numerical simulation results presented in this section were obtained from runs of 40,000 sweeps ( after thermalization ) on a @xmath73 lattice using a variety of work stations .",
    "we have observed that this additional source of @xmath49 is small compared to the renormalization of the plaquette couplings discussed in the preceeding section , regardless of @xmath9 .",
    "for example , even @xmath74 at @xmath10 leads to a shift in @xmath6 per fermion of @xmath75 .",
    "this value of @xmath71 corresponds to @xmath76 which yields a zero - temperature predicted shift in @xmath6 per fermion of @xmath77 .",
    "although the effect of the @xmath71 term in the effective action on the critical value of @xmath6 is quite small , @xmath71 has a profound effect on the character of the transition .",
    "figure  [ f7 ] shows the frequency distribution for the spatial expectation value of the polyakov loop as a function of @xmath71 at the appropriate @xmath78 on a @xmath79 lattice . as @xmath71 increases , the peaks associated with the two phases move closer together until they merge at what is presumably a second - order critical end - point",
    "a first - order phase transition exists for values of @xmath71 smaller than approximately @xmath80 .",
    "the monte carlo results for the phase diagram of a pure gauge theory with an @xmath71 coupling can be mapped back to the phase diagram of qcd with dynamical quarks by including both the @xmath71 term and the shift @xmath13 . including zero - temperature plaquette coupling renormalization , the endpoint of this first - order phase transition line maps to the point @xmath81 in the @xmath82-plane for the case of sixteen degenerate staggered fermion species .",
    "this is roughly consistent with the endpoint of the first - order phase transition observed in simulations with dynamical staggered fermions @xcite .",
    "however , a definitive comparison will likely require significant computational resources .",
    "figure [ f8 ] , a graph of @xmath1 versus @xmath5 , summarizes the results we have obtained . as shown by hasenfratz and degrand ,",
    "the zero - temperature shift in the coupling constant due to dynamical fermions nicely accounts for the shift in @xmath1 .",
    "we have found that finite temperature corrections to the gauge coupling renormalization lift the degeneracy of the spatial and temporal couplings , and the results are significantly different from the zero - temperature results .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , they are in conflict with the monte carlo data . at finite temperature ,",
    "dynamical fermions couple to polyakov loops via loops circling the lattice in the timelike direction .",
    "this also acts to shift the value of @xmath1 .",
    "this shift is small , however , and does not restore the success of the zero - temperature calculation .",
    "as we have shown , the image expansion makes it plausible that the success of the zero - temperature calculation in determining the critical value of @xmath6 is due to a nonperturbative suppression of finite temperature effects in the low temperature regime .",
    "specifically , the small expectation value of the polyakov loops at low temperatures indicates a suppression of those quark paths which account for finite temperature corrections .",
    "this leads to the behavior of the effective gauge coupling constants shown in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] above .",
    "if this picture is correct , a gauge theory with dynamical fermions of intermediate mass is well modeled by a pure gauge theory in which the spatial and temporal couplings are slightly different . along the critical line , both couplings jump discontinuously .",
    "this could be studied in more detail by adjusting spatial and temporal couplings in a pure gauge theory simulation so that plaquette expectation values matched those observed in dynamical simulations .",
    "this might also afford an opportunity to consider the effects of finite spatial sizes .",
    "such effects are easily included in eq .",
    "[ e2.5.2 ] for the coupling shift by choosing the spatial mode sums appropriately .",
    "while the coupling to polyakov loops induced by dynamic fermion loops seems to play little role in determining @xmath1 , this coupling does influence the order of the transition ; in our @xmath10 simulations of a pure gauge theory with an additional coupling @xmath71 to polyakov loops , a sufficiently large value of @xmath71 causes the first order line to terminate , while shifting @xmath1 very little .",
    "thus , the effective coupling @xmath71 appears to be the most important factor in determining the end point of the first - order deconfining phase transition line .",
    "in addition to the transition temperature , other quantities can be estimated using these perturbative techniques .",
    "for example , the chiral order parameter @xmath83 can be estimated as a constant term plus a term proportional to the expectation value of a plaquette plus a term proportional to the expectation value of the polyakov loop .",
    "however , the use of a perturbative evaluation of the fermion determinant obviously fails to include the effects of chiral symmetry breaking , which is the dominant factor in determining @xmath83 for light quarks .",
    "presumably this accounts for the failure of the effective theory for light quark masses .",
