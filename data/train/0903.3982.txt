    "in general relativity , as other areas of physics , the notion of energy is of both conceptual and practical importance . unlike other areas of physics however",

    "the global definitions of energy , such as the bondi or adm formulations , also seem inadequate because they are not localized and must necessarily refer to the entire spacetime .",
    "a reasonable compromise seems to have been reached with the notion of ` quasilocal energy '  energy that is defined for an extended but finite region of spacetime .",
    "there is a plethora of definitions of quasilocal energy , many of which are thoroughly reviewed in @xcite .",
    "the virtues and weaknesses of these definitions can be revealed by application to specific spacetimes . the schwarzschild and kerr spacetimes are common testing grounds for the various notions of quasilocal energy . however the fact that these spacetimes are stationary limits their discriminating power .",
    "non - stationary examples can discern among the various notions of quasilocal energy in a way that stationary examples can not .",
    "the primary purpose of this paper is to examine the case of a generic friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker universe , commonly referred to as frw cosmology in much of the literature . aside from its practical applicability",
    ", this non - stationary example reveals in a new way how various notions of quasilocal energy differ from one another . due to limitations of time and space ,",
    "i have chosen to focus on only two formulations of quasilocal energy among the many possible ones .",
    "the first is the formulation of brown and york @xcite and the second is the closely related formulation of epp @xcite .",
    "i will comment on other formulations only in passing , although they certainly deserve greater attention .",
    "from a theoretical point of view , the brown - york formulation is appealing because it is based on the rigorous hamilton - jacobi theory of classical mechanics .",
    "although one may question the applicability of this theory to general relativity , the ends ultimately justify its use .",

    "however , for an arbitrary 2-manifold embedded in a 4-manifold , the extrinsic curvature has two components . in other words , being of codimension two , @xmath14 has two linearly independent normal vectors each of which has an extrinsic curvature associated with it .",
    "a natural question then is to ask which of the two components should be used to calculate quasilocal energy .",
    "above , @xmath14 is viewed as a submanifold of @xmath4 , and its normal @xmath32 in @xmath4 is used to calculate the quasilocal energy .",

    ", the calculation above depends in a critical way on the choice of foliation .",
    "a different foliation of @xmath2 would mix the two components of extrinsic curvature , giving an entirely different expression for the quasilocal energy .",
    "the static spacetimes considered in @xcite have a natural foliation for which the second component of extrinsic curvature vanishes and thus makes no contribution to the quasilocal energy . for a robertson - walker spacetime ,",
    "this is no longer the case .",
    "what is missing from the above calculation is a proper treatment of both components of extrinsic curvature .",
    "the basic idea behind the notion of quasilocal energy , at least in the brown - york and epp formulations , is that the energy contained in a closed surface is related to the extrinsic curvature of that surface .",
    "therefore to begin with , a precise definition of extrinsic curvature is needed .",

    "the second fundamental form is in fact defined by this decomposition @xcite : @xmath100 the induced covariant derivative is the projection of @xmath101 onto @xmath20 , and is the unique covariant derivative that is torsion - free and compatible with the induced metric on @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the mean extrinsic curvature vector @xmath102 is defined as the trace of the second fundamental form : @xmath103 where the vectors @xmath104 are tangent to the submanifold @xmath20 .",

    ", the second fundamental form is defined simply as @xmath109 . in this case , since there is only one normal vector , it can be omitted from the definition , making the second fundamental form a tensor of type @xmath110 . in this context , the second fundamental form is also called the extrinsic curvature .",

    "it can also be shown for @xmath113 and @xmath85 compatible with @xmath84 that @xmath114 .",
    "this is the basis for writing , as one often sees in the literature , @xmath115 .",
    "also in this context , the mean extrinsic curvature vector is really just a scalar and reduces to the usual definition of mean extrinsic curvature found in the study of surfaces embedded in @xmath116 for example .    adapting the above notation to the case at hand ,",
    "@xmath2 becomes the four - dimensional spacetime , and @xmath20 becomes the two - dimensional boundary surface @xmath14 .",
    "being of dimension two and codimension two , @xmath14 has two tangent vectors @xmath117 , and two normal vectors @xmath118 .",
    "the epp definition of quasilocal energy can be expressed in terms of the mean extrinsic curvature scalar .",
    "the energy inside @xmath14 , without the reference term , is : @xmath119 a reference point must also be defined . as before , minkowski spacetime is used as the reference , and the epp quasilocal energy becomes : @xmath120 epp s derivation of this result was motivated by an analogy with the formula @xmath121 from special relativity , and so proceeded along different lines than that presented here .",
    "however as epp notes @xcite , the final result can be expressed in terms of the means extrinsic curvature scalar exactly as in .",
    "it is instructive to compare the epp energy to the brown - york energy .",
    "the main distinction of the epp energy is that it is independent of the foliation .",
    "this is so because in @xmath105 both components of the extrinsic curvature are accounted for and combined in a way that is invariant under a change of basis for the normal space @xmath90",
    ". since the choice of foliation is tantamount to the choice of observers , this amounts to saying that the epp energy is invariant under boosts of observers .",
    "for this reason , it is tempting to refer to epp s definition as quasilocal mass rather than energy .",
    "however , other properties of this quantity compel epp to refer to it as an ` invariant quasilocal energy ' rather than mass @xcite .    for stationary spacetimes ,",
    "the brown - york energy calculated for stationary observers is identical to the epp energy .",
    "to put it differently , suppose that for a stationary spacetime one chooses the natural constant-@xmath13 foliation , where @xmath13 is the coordinate along the timelike killing vector .",
    "then , the brown - york energy calculated for this foliation is equal to the epp energy .",
    "for example , both formulations results in the same expression for the quasilocal energy of schwarzschild spacetime : @xmath122 in the limit @xmath123 , this result reduces to @xmath2 which is exactly the adm energy .",
    "the real distinction between these formulations manifests itself when considering non - stationary spacetimes where the natural choice of foliation can result in non - vanishing extrinsic curvature in both components . in the next section",
    ", this is demonstrated explicitly in the context of frw cosmology .",
    "it should be mentioned that the epp quasilocal energy is similar to the definition offered by wang and yau in @xcite .",

    "although their approach is considerably more complicated , it can be shown that with the natural foliation and a constant time function , @xmath125 , their approach and that of epp give the same result when applied to the frw universe .      in this subsection",
