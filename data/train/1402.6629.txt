    "the very possibility of scientific investigation requires a universe satisfying a simple but fundamental symmetry : what we humans choose to call things can not affect what is going on .",
    "the laws of nature must not , in particular , depend on our designation , at any particular moment , of a `` system of interest '' to investigate .",
    "whatever these laws are , they must be invariant under our various divisions of the world into `` systems '' and their `` surrounding environments '' ; without such invariance , there would be no sense in which nature could be said to have laws . moreover , objectivity , even in its most minimal sense of intersubjectivity among human observers , requires that the laws of nature be invariant under changes in who is making the observations . if every observer inferred different laws from their observations , science would be impossible .",
    "let us call this fundamental symmetry `` decompositional equivalence '' and define it as follows : any system satisfies decompositional equivalence if and only if the laws governing its behavior are invariant under arbitrary decompositions of the system into subsystems .",
    "to say that the physical universe @xmath0 satisfies decompositional equivalence is then to say that the laws of physics , or alternatively , physical interactions , are invariant under arbitrary decompositions of @xmath0 into subsystems .",
    "it is , in particular , to say that the laws of physics are invariant under arbitrary decompositions of @xmath0 into a system of interest @xmath1 , an observer @xmath2 and a surrounding environment @xmath3 , where @xmath3 is taken to include everything in @xmath0 not included in either @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "decompositional equivalence can be viewed as a form of scale invariance . if the laws of physics are invariant under arbitrary decompositions of @xmath0 into @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , then they are invariant under changes in the scales at which @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are defined .",
    "decompositional equivalence can , therefore , be rendered as the claim that there is no preferred scale of observation and hence no preferred class of observers .",
    "if @xmath0 satisfies decompositional equivalence , the laws of physics in @xmath0 are independent of what _ any _ observer might choose to designate as the `` system of interest . ''    it is shown here that the physical universe @xmath0 satisfying decompositional equivalence is , when combined with landauer s principle that `` information is physical '' and hence has a finite free - energy cost of encoding @xcite , sufficient to generate quantum theory .",
    "it is , in particular , sufficient to generate standard , unitary quantum theory .",
    "quantum theory is , therefore , the correct physical theory of a universe that satisfies both landauer s principle and decompositional equivalence .",
    "if quantum theory is false , then either landauer s principle is false and information needs not be physically encoded , or else decompositional equivalence is false and a scale - independent or observer - independent science is impossible .",
    "demonstrating this claim is surprisingly straightforward .",
    "the first step is to recognize that if @xmath2 can be chosen arbitrarily , @xmath2 can not be assumed to encode any particular information about @xmath1 prior to making observations .",
    "therefore the only information about @xmath1 that @xmath2 can be regarded as encoding is information obtained by observation .",
    "as information is physical , obtaining information by observation requires physical interaction .",
    "hence @xmath2 can obtain information about @xmath1 only through physical interaction .",
    "the second step is to note that the subsystem of @xmath0 with which @xmath2 interacts , which will be referred to as @xmath4 for @xmath2 s `` box , '' comprises both @xmath1 and @xmath3 . because @xmath0 satisfies decompositional equivalence , @xmath2 s physical interaction with @xmath4 , described formally by a hamiltonian operator @xmath5 , must be invariant under arbitrary alternative partitionings of @xmath4 .",
    "this invariance of @xmath5 under arbitrary alternative partitionings of @xmath4 renders @xmath4 a _ black box _ as defined by classical cybernetics @xcite , a system with observable external behavior but an unobservable and hence unknowable interior .",
    "the third step is to show that if landauer s principle is assumed , the acquisition of information from a black box is described by unitary quantum theory .",
    "the three sections that follow make this demonstration precise .",
    "its consequences for the physical interpretation of quantum superposition are then discussed , using the canonical double - slit experiment as an example .",
    "the paper concludes by raising the obvious question : if decompositions can be made arbitrarily , what explains the ability of human - or any - observers to agree about what they are observing ? in a universe satisfying decompositional equivalence , this becomes a question for fundamental physics .    before proceeding ,",
    "however , it is worth noting that decompositional equivalence is in fact built into the formalisms of both classical and quantum physics .",
    "both theories employ abstract vector spaces to represent physical states , the real configuration space in classical physics and the complex hilbert space in quantum physics .",
    "both spaces can be arbitrarily decomposed into subspaces using vector - space product operators , the cartesian product @xmath6 in classical physics and the tensor product @xmath7 in quantum physics .",
    "these operators are both associative : for any decomposition of @xmath0 into @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 , the configuration space @xmath8 in classical physics , and the hilbert space @xmath9 in quantum physics .",
    "classical physics , however , violates landauer s principle by assuming the possibility of arbitrarily - precise measurements , and standard approximations and idealizations commonly employed within both theories violate decompositional equivalence either by assuming that physical laws change abruptly at system boundaries or by treating some system boundaries as objectively `` preferred '' over others .",
    "alternatives to standard , unitary quantum theory that introduce a physical `` collapse '' process ( e.g. @xcite ) , in particular , violate decompositional equivalence at all scales at which the collapse process is permitted to occur . as will be shown , it is the ubiquitous presence of such ancillary , decompositional - equivalence - violating assumptions that renders even standard unitary quantum theory paradoxical .",
    "when decompositional equivalence is explicitly respected , nothing collapses , nothing decoheres and there are no `` multiple worlds '' ; in this case , the distinction between `` quantum '' and `` classical '' becomes a semantic distinction between physical dynamics , which must be represented using quantum theory , and observational outcomes , which are _ descriptions of _ physical dynamics encoded by finite strings of classical bits .",
    "the paradoxes associated with `` collapse '' are replaced , in the present analysis , by deep empirical questions about the structure and functioning of observers , human or otherwise .",
    "in a universe satisfying decompositional equivalence , how subsystems are defined or designated can make no difference to the laws of physics . how subsystems are defined or designated",
    "can , therefore , make no difference to the dynamics executed by the universe ; hence the universal hamiltonian @xmath10 representing those dynamics must be invariant under arbitrary changes in the definition or designation of subsystems .",
    "this invariance is , once again , built into the formalism of both classical and quantum physics ; in both theories , the hamiltonian @xmath11 for any arbitrary choice of @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 , where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the self - interactions of @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 respectively and the higher - order terms are between - system interactions .",
    "the associativity of addition then guarantees decompositional equivalence .",
    "if @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 can be defined or designated arbitrarily , the labels ` @xmath1 , ' ` @xmath3 ' and ` @xmath2 ' clearly can have no special meaning .",
    "any subsystem whatsoever can be designated as the system of interest ; similarly , any system whatsoever can be considered to be an `` environment '' or an `` observer . ''",
    "any restriction on the kinds of subsystems labelled with these terms , e.g. any restriction on the hamiltonians @xmath13 or @xmath14 beyond the requirement that @xmath11 , violates decompositional equivalence .    while trivial from a formal perspective , the arbitrariness with which @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 can be chosen has important consequences for how the theory is interpreted and used .",
    "the first and most important of these is that observers can not be assumed to have any special characteristics or to be in any particular special state at the initiation of observations .",
    "observers can not , in particular , be assumed to have any prior knowledge of the system being observed .",
    "if observation is characterized in bayesian terms , the probability distribution over the states of the observed system prior to any observations being conducted must be assumed to be uniform .",
    "the assumption that observers have no prior knowledge of the system being observed is often stated in discussions of both classical and quantum physics .",
    "schlosshauer , for example , includes the idea that observers can be `` initially completely ignorant '' when describing classical observations :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` here ( i.e. in classical physics ) we can enlarge our ` catalog ' of physical properties of the system ( and therefore specify its state more completely ) by performing an arbitrary number of measurements of identical physical quantities , in any given order",

    "how then can they agree that they have observed the same system ?",
    "within the context of a formal , theoretical description of the situation , it can simply be stipulated that the observers are jointly interacting with one single system , just as the ancient proverb stipulates that the blind men are interacting with a single elephant .",
    "any such stipulation , however , clearly begs the question of how the stipulating agent identified the system under observation and determined that it , not something else , was the system with which each observer was interacting ( e.g. @xcite ) . how is the situation to be described if this artificial , question - begging `` god s eye '' stipulation is removed ?    if observers are arbitrarily chosen and can not be assumed to have any prior knowledge of the systems to be observed , and if `` god s eye '' stipulations",
    "that _ this _ observer is interacting with _ that _ system are rejected as question - begging , what remains to be said is that an observer interacted with a system - some system or other - and received an observational outcome .",
    "the observational outcome(s ) received constitute the observer s entire knowledge of the system .",
    "a well - established , over half - century - old body of theory describes the situation in which an observer can obtain outcomes from an observed system , but can know nothing about the system beyond the outcomes that have been obtained .",
    "this is precisely the situation of an observer who interacts with a `` black box '' as described by classical cybernetics ( e.g. @xcite ) or of an observer who receives signals , via a communication channel , from an unknown source as described by classical information theory @xcite .",

    "what , however , can be said about @xmath16 itself , and how can the two distinct states @xmath42 and @xmath41 be further characterized ?",
    "here it is necessary to return to the theorist s perspective .",
    "from this perspective , it is clear that the state designations `` @xmath42 '' and `` @xmath41 '' are highly ambiguous ; both refer to multiple spatial configurations of objects that are distinguishable from a `` god s eye '' perspective but indistinguishable by @xmath2 .",
    "the state transitions @xmath49 and @xmath50 are similarly , from the theorist s perspective , implemented by multiple distinct changes in the spatial configuration of objects .    as @xmath2 functions as a clock , the time coordinate @xmath26 can be used to parameterize the state changes that occur in @xmath4 and hence to parameterize the action of @xmath16 .",
    "each tick of this clock and hence the two endpoints of each interval @xmath27 correspond to some object being brought into contact , through the action of @xmath16 , with @xmath2 s meter stick . hence @xmath16 can be regarded as a periodic function of @xmath26 with period @xmath27 . with respect to some arbitrarily chosen initial value @xmath51 , one or the other of @xmath41 or @xmath42 is observed at each subsequent time @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , etc . whether @xmath41 or @xmath42 is observed after @xmath55 clock ticks , i.e. at @xmath56 can , therefore , be viewed as determined by the values at @xmath56 of two time - dependent phase angles @xmath57 and @xmath58 . as",
    "@xmath16 is unobservable by @xmath2 , these phase angles must be unobservable by @xmath2 .",
    "they must , therefore , be complex phases , i.e. there are real functions @xmath59 and @xmath60 such that @xmath61 and @xmath61 .",
    "hence the observed state @xmath62 of @xmath4 at @xmath26 can be written :    @xmath63    where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are real coefficients chosen so that @xmath66 . from the `` god s eye ''",
    "perspective , it is clear that the ratio @xmath67 .",
    "one would , moreover , expect from this perspective that over a sufficiently long elapsed time , the probabilities @xmath68 and @xmath69 of observing @xmath42 and @xmath41 , respectively , would be such that @xmath70 , i.e. one would expect the usual born rule of quantum theory to hold .",
    "because @xmath4 is a black box , however , the numbers @xmath71 and @xmath72 can not be determined by observation , so the equation @xmath73 can not be derived by @xmath2 . the ergotic assumption that the observed frequencies of @xmath42 and @xmath41 between @xmath51 and @xmath56 for some large @xmath55 correspond to probabilities of future observations can not be proved valid for any black box , as its validity would contradict the ashby - moore theorem noted earlier .",
    "the born rule remains , therefore , a useful _ rule _ for an observer , but it can not be considered a theorem .    with the characterization of @xmath62 given by eq .",
    "3 , it is clear that the postulated @xmath40 is a ( finite dimensional ) hilbert space , that @xmath42 and @xmath41 are basis vectors , and that @xmath46 and @xmath47 are von neumann projections .",
    "the generalization from two basis vectors to any finite number is , moreover , straightforward . as any physically - implemented measurement device has finite resolution - infinite resolution would , by landauer s principle , entail infinite free - energy consumption - infinite - dimensional hilbert spaces are , as previously pointed out by fuchs @xcite , merely a convenience for performing calculations .",
    "it remains now only to establish that the time - propagator @xmath74 associated with @xmath16 is unitary , from which the schrdinger equation follows .",
    "the propagator @xmath74 , however , is just the function :    @xmath75    for any @xmath76 . combining eq . 2 and 3 to replace states by the operators that produce them , we have :    @xmath77    as @xmath46 and @xmath47 resolve the identity on @xmath40",
    ", @xmath78 must be unitary .",
    "the physical dynamics represented by @xmath74 and @xmath16 is , therefore , symmetric in @xmath26 . from the `` god s eye ''",
    "perspective , this time symmetry corresponds to reversibility of the mechanism that brings objects into contact with the meter stick . from @xmath2 s perspective",
    ", it corresponds to @xmath2 s inability to determine whether an apparently - random bit string is being read forwards or backwards .",
    "the expressions in eq .",
    "3 and 5 are clearly superpositions ; the basis vectors @xmath42 and @xmath41 are superposed in eq . 3 and the operators @xmath46 and @xmath47 are superposed in eq .",
    "the physicality of superpositions is widely regarded as one of the central mysteries of quantum theory .",
    "it is , therefore , worth reflected on what these expressions mean .",
    "the first thing to note is that nothing is superposed in fig .",
    "2 ; indeed fig .",
    "2 depicts a perfectly `` classical '' layout of macroscopic objects .",
    "this classical layout is , however , merely a theoretical stipulation ; it is drawn from a `` god s eye '' perspective that does not correspond to the perspective of the specified observer @xmath2 . as fig .",
    "2 assigns each object a specific position , considering this `` god s eye '' perspective to be the perspective of any observer would violate the assumption that any observer s world is , for that observer , a black box . any observer s world",
    "being , for that observer , a black box is as we have seen a consequence of decompositional equivalence ; it is decompositional equivalence that limits observers to only the information that can be transferred across the observer - box boundary by a well - defined observer - box interaction hamiltonian .",
    "attributing the `` god s eye '' perspective to an observer therefore violates decompositional equivalence .",
    "the information that any observer _ can _ obtain from the world is determined by the measurement devices that the observer can deploy .",
    "landauer s principle restricts any observer to a finite free - energy budget , so both the number of measurement devices and their measurement resolutions must be finite .",
    "what can be obtained from the world is therefore , for any observer , just a finite set of finite bit strings .",
    "such finite sets of bit strings provide the only observational input into , and the only observational evidence for testing , any formalized model of the world .",
    "in this situation , observers are faced with two unresolvable ambiguities .",
    "first , it is impossible , in principle , for an observer to distinguish changes in the state of a single system from the unobserved substitution of one system for another . in the world of fig .",
    "2 , for example , @xmath2 can not determine whether a change in observed outcome from `` 0 '' to `` 1 '' reflects a change in the length of some single object that is in continuous contact with the meter stick , or a change in which object has been placed in contact with the meter stick .",
    "the states @xmath42 and @xmath41 are , therefore , ambiguous as to system ; @xmath2 can not determine which system they are states of .",
    "second , it is impossible , in principle , for an observer to determine whether a fixed state is the state of a fixed system . in the world of fig .",
    "2 , the outcomes `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' are both ambiguous between many systems .",
    "these ambiguities characterize the outcomes obtainable by any observer of any black box , regardless of the number of measurement devices that can be deployed or their resolution , as long as both are finite , i.e. as long as landauer s principle is respected . the well - known `` no - go '' theorems of quantum theory , including bell s theorem and the kochen - specker theorem , follow from these ambiguities about the provenance of observational outcomes @xcite .",
    "superpositions provide a natural mathematical representation of this in - principle ambiguity about the provenance of observational outcomes .",
    "while it is standard practice in presentations of quantum theory to treat the system as fixed and represent the system s states as superpositions , this practice has no formal basis and , as we have seen , implicitly violates decompositional equivalence .",
    "it is entirely equivalent , and intuitively far more natural , to treat the observed state as fixed and represent the system occupying that state as a superposition .",
    "it is , after all , the _ state _ that is observed , as it is the state - being at this position , being this big , having this mass , moving this fast , etc .",
    "- that corresponds to the value(s ) of one or more measurement outcomes .    when the ubiquitous superpositions in quantum theory are viewed this way , as superpositions of systems , not states , they cease to be so mysterious . while natural language expresses the conceit that `` systems '' are fixed and enduring things , we all know that this is not actually the case .",
    "the microstructures of all systems are in constant flux .",
    "living systems obviously gain and lose material components , and hence become different _ physical systems _ , on a daily if not hourly or even moment - to - moment basis ; your own breathing provides an example .",
    "it is , moreover , just an item of faith , sometimes explicitly propped up by appeals to occam s razor , that systems do not undergo more radical alterations or even substitutions of one for another while we are not observing them .",
    "the cognitive mechanisms underlying this item of faith are becoming better understood , largely by studying their points of failure @xcite .",
    "quantum theory reminds us that this inference of object identity through time is always just an _ inference _ , one based on observational outcomes that can not , even in principle , demonstrate the conclusion .",
    "quantum theory was originally developed not by considering thought experiments such as that presented here , but by searching for a mathematical formalism that could explain the results of otherwise - mystifying experiments .",
    "once it was understood that light behaved like a particle in the quantum domain , the already century - old double - slit experiment , which when performed by thomas young in 1803 had demonstrated that light behaved as a wave , became a mystery .",
    "indeed feynman , in an often - quoted passage , describes it as `` a phenomenon which is impossible , _ absolutely _ impossible , to explain in any classical way , and which has in it the heart of quantum mechanics . in reality",
    ", it contains the only mystery '' ( @xcite vol .",

    "1.1 , emphasis in original ) .",
    "the apparatus for the double - slit experiment is schematically illustrated , from the perspective of its designer , in fig .",
    "a source emits particles or waves of some kind : photons , electrons , c@xmath79 `` buckyballs '' @xcite or even heavier molecules with masses up to 10,000 amu @xcite .",
    "these pass though a pair of slits , the implementation of which depends on the type of particle / wave passing through them , and are detected at some distance beyond the slits .",
    "these components of the apparatus are connected by a rigid structure that also isolates them , in darkness and under high vacuum , from the outside world .",
    "observers employing the double - slit apparatus to make measurements do not , therefore , have observational access to the internals of the instrument .",
    "observers interact , instead , with a `` user interface '' comprising controls that set the source intensity and the states , either open or closed , of the two slits , together with a display screen that shows the positions , on the @xmath80 plane perpendicular to the instrument s axis , of any detected particles .",
    "the state of the instrument from the observer s perspective is defined by the states of these interface elements , as shown in fig . 3b .",

    "if neither slit is open , nothing is detected on the screen . if only one slit is open ,",
    "particles are detected in an approximately gaussian distribution , elongated on the @xmath86 axis and centered on the @xmath80 position of the open slit .",
    "if both slits are open , an interference pattern appears along the @xmath85 axis of the display , with the interference peak and valley intensities indicated on the @xmath86 axis .",
    "these patterns are maintained even if the source intensity is set to just one particle per unit time .",
    "if , however , the detection screen is moved to be immediately behind the slits ( for photons ) or some means of detecting which slit a particle passed through is installed ( for massive particles ) , the interference pattern disappears .",
    "the standard interpretation of this phenomenology is that individual particles , even individual large molecules such as the porphyrins employed by @xcite , act as waves , passing through both slits if both are open and subsequently interfering with themselves .",
    "both this ambiguous wave - particle behavior and the fact that the interference pattern disappears if the particle s trajectory is `` observed '' by monitoring the slit it passed through are canonical `` quantum '' phenomena .",
    "let us consider this standard interpretation in somewhat more detail .",
    "if the source intensity is adjusted so that many particles are emitted per unit time , the resulting `` beam '' of particles illuminates the plate @xmath82 in which the slits are cut .",
    "some fraction of the `` beam '' passes through the slits and subsequently , the `` beam '' components that passed through the left slit interfere with the components that passed through the right slit .",
    "this situation is analogous to what happens when water waves encounter a breakwater barrier with two openings , as often demonstrated in laboratory exercises for beginning physics students .",
    "hence the `` beam '' behaves like a classical wave .",
    "this classical analogy breaks down , however , when the source intensity is turned down to one particle per unit time . as the interference pattern persists , built up one detection event at a time , it must be assumed either that each particle went through both slits and subsequently interfered with itself , or else that the particles can interfere with each other across time , with the first assumption by far the most commonly chosen . in this case",
    "the trajectory of each particle can be thought of as comprising two components .",
    "first , the particle travels from the source to both slits ; representing the @xmath85 coordinates of the slits as @xmath87 and @xmath88 and ignoring the other coordinates , this first part of the trajectory can be represented as @xmath89 ( the @xmath85 coordinate location of the source ) @xmath90 .",
    "this first part of the trajectory has , in other words , a fixed starting point but a superposition of end points .",
    "the second part of the trajectory can then be represented as @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the @xmath85 coordinate of the detection event .",
    "each particle is , therefore , considered to be in a superposition of @xmath85 coordinate states for its entire trajectory , excepting only its initial location at the source and its final location on the detector .",
    "the @xmath85 coordinate of each particle is , however , _ observed _ only at the detector .",
    "no aspect of its trajectory is observed other than its detection at @xmath93 .",
    "indeed , that the particle even has a trajectory is an interpretative assumption based on the designer s , not the observer s , perspective on the apparatus .",
    "what the observer can determine by observation is that the number of detection events correlates with the source intensity provided that at least one slit is open , and that the number of open slits determines the pattern - either gaussian or interference - that is detected . by appeal to the classical theory of waves , the observer can infer that the slits are far enough from the detection screen for an interference pattern to develop whenever both slits are open .",
    "where , however , is the source ?",
    "it is consistent with the observed detection patterns that each slit is also a source ; if a slit is open , it emits particles at the chosen intensity , but if it is closed it does not . the question : `` what is the source of a particle detected at time @xmath94 ? '' has , therefore , a determinate answer if only one slit is open , but if both slits are open , the answer is ambiguous .",
    "this ambiguity can be expressed by representing the source as being in a superposition @xmath95 of positions along the @xmath85 axis , or following the reasoning in  5 , representing the source as a superposition of systems @xmath96 , where the notations `` @xmath97 '' and `` @xmath98 '' refer to left and right sources of particles .",
    "these alternative expressions equally capture what an observer can know about the source of an observed particle .",
    "it is important to note that taking the apparatus apart to allow inspection of the internal components does not resolve the ambiguity .",
    "once the instrument is disassembled , the interference pattern disappears . indeed",
    "any attempt to determine whether the particle has a trajectory prior to encountering the slits disrupts the pattern , just as attempting to determine which slit has been traversed does .",
    "the source superpositions @xmath95 or @xmath96 , and the interference pattern they produce , can therefore be viewed as a consequence - perhaps even a side - effect - of the isolation and consequent unobservability of the internals of the apparatus .",
    "they are , in other words , consequences of the apparatus being a black box .",
    "decompositional equivalence is such a simple and fundamental symmetry that it is generally assumed without comment .",
    "whenever we give the components of some composite object separate names , for example , we assume decompositional equivalence : we assume that our identification and naming of subsystems within the composite system does not change how the composite system behaves . from a formal perspective , we assume decompositional equivalence whenever we represent the physical states of an object as elements in an abstract space on which an associative product is well - defined . without this assumption ,",
    "any discussion of `` subsystems '' or `` parts '' becomes impossible ; without decompositional equivalence , singling some part of an object out as `` of interest '' potentially changes the object s behavior in arbitrary ways .",
    "what has been shown here is that this fundamental symmetry is , when combined with landauer s principle , sufficient to derive quantum theory .",
    "the derivation turns on a simple observation : if the decomposition of an object does not affect its overt behavior , then its overt behavior can not determine its decomposition .",
    "its overt behavior can not , in particular , provide evidence for the existence of a `` preferred '' decomposition . by allowing any system",
    "to be arbitrarily decomposed without consequences , decompositional equivalence renders any supposed internal boundaries dynamically irrelevant .",
    "it renders all systems black boxes .",
    "what the formalism of quantum theory describes are the observational outcomes obtainable from a black box .",
    "the ubiquitous superpositions of quantum theory account formally for the in - principle ambiguity of outcome provenance with which observers of a black box are faced .    because decompositional equivalence is generally implicit , assumptions that violate decompositional equivalence often go unnoticed .",
    "any assumption that some subsystem boundaries , but not others , can be regarded as `` given '' by the laws of nature violates decompositional equivalence .",
    "this very assumption is made , however , whenever it is assumed that multiple observers will identify the same subsystem boundaries as `` preferred '' and hence identify the same subsystems as `` systems of interest . ''",
    "it is also made whenever special physical processes , such as `` collapse '' or decoherence , are assumed to occur at some subsystem boundaries but not others .",
    "such assumptions are , effectively , assumptions that some particular `` preferred '' subsystem boundaries are fixed by the initial conditions of the universe @xcite .",
    "the empirical success of quantum theory indicates that such decompositional - equivalence - violating assumptions are unjustified .    in place of the usual paradoxes of `` collapse '' or `` multiple worlds , '' a quantum theory that explicitly acknowledges decompositional equivalence presents us with deep empirical questions about the structure and functioning of observers . if `` preferred '' subsystem boundaries are not `` given '' by the laws of nature , what explains the ability of human observers to agree about what constitutes a `` system '' ?",
    "how is communication by pointing possible , let alone communication by language ?",
    "how are shared semantics ever developed ?",
    "these are generally regarded as questions for developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience .",
    "decompositional equivalence reveals that they are questions for fundamental physics as well .",
