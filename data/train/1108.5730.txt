    "the concept of isolated system plays a fundamental role in the formulation of the quantum mechanics .",
    "this concept is an idealization that was constructed as an aid to understand some phenomena displayed by real systems which may be regarded as approximately isolated .",
    "however , since about 50 years ago , the study of quantum decoherence has acquired a central position in the formulation of the quantum mechanics .",
    "in fact , concepts such as thermodynamic equilibrium seem impossible to coordinate with the idea of isolated system because the quantum state for such a system follows a unitary evolution and it can not reach a final equilibrium state at @xmath0 .    in this context",
    "we ask ourselves if it is possible to introduce the concept of temperature for an isolated quantum system which evolves in a composite hilbert space . in this paper",
    "the system known as the quantum walk on the line @xcite has been chosen as a model to answer this question . the quantum walk ( qw ) is a natural generalization of the classical random walk in the frame of quantum computation and quantum information processing and it is receiving permanent attention childs , linden , alejo3 .",
    "it has the property to spread over the line linearly in time as characterized by the standard deviation @xmath1 , while its classical analog spreads out as @xmath2 .",
    "this property , as well as quantum parallelism and quantum entanglement , could be used to increase the efficiency of quantum algorithms @xcite .",
    "recently we have been investigating @xcite the asymptotic behavior of the qw on the line , focusing on the probability distribution of chirality independently of position .",
    "we showed that this distribution has a stationary long - time limit that depends on the initial conditions .",
    "this result is unexpected in the context of the unitary evolution of the qw because such a behavior is usually associated to a markovian process . in this paper",
    "we further explore the behavior of the chirality distribution and define a thermodynamic equilibrium between the degrees of freedom of position and chirality .",
    "this equilibrium allows to introduce a temperature concept for this unitary closed system .",
    "we obtain a master equation with a time - dependent population rate , that describes the transient behavior of the reduced density operator of the qw towards thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the qw s reduced density operator shows an surprising behavior : its behavior looks diffusive but however the global evolution of the system is unitary .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "the standard qw model is developed , in the third section the entanglement temperature is defined .",
    "then in the fourth and fifth sections the entanglement temperature is obtained for localized initial conditions and for distributed initial conditions respectively . in the six section the transient behavior towards thermal equilibrium",
    "is studied , and finally in the last section some conclusions are drafted .",
    "the composite hilbert space of the qw is the tensor product @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the hilbert space associated to the motion on the line and @xmath5 is the chirality ( or coin ) hilbert space . in this composite space",
    "the walker moves , at discrete time steps @xmath6 , along a one - dimensional lattice of sites @xmath7 .",
    "the direction of motion depends on the state of the chirality , with the eigenstates @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the wave vector can be expressed as the spinor @xmath10 |k\\rangle ,   \\label{spinor}\\]]where the upper ( lower ) component is associated to the left ( right ) chirality .",
    "then @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the probability of finding the walker at @xmath13 and the coin in state @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the probability of finding the walker at @xmath13 is @xmath14and @xmath15 .",
    "the qw is ruled by a unitary map whose standard form is @xcite @xmath16where @xmath17 $ ] is a parameter defining the bias of the coin toss ( @xmath18 for an unbiased or hadamard coin ) .",
    "the global left and right chirality probabilities is defined as @xmath19with @xmath20 .",
    "the global chirality distribution ( gcd ) is defined as the distribution formed by the couple @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the gcd satisfies the following map @xmath22 } & = { \\left ( \\begin{array}{cc } \\cos ^{2}\\theta   & \\sin ^{2}\\theta   \\\\ \\sin ^{2}\\theta   & \\cos ^{2}\\theta \\end{array}\\right ) } \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } p_{l}(t ) \\\\ p_{r}(t)\\end{array}\\right ]    \\notag \\\\ & + \\mathrm{re}\\left [ q(t)\\right ] \\sin { 2}\\theta \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } 1 \\\\ -1\\end{array}\\right ] ,   \\label{master}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath23the two dimensional matrix in eq.([master ] ) can be interpreted as a transition probability matrix for a classical two dimensional random walk as it satisfies the necessary requirements , namely , all its elements are positive and the sum over the elements of any column or row is equal to one . on the other hand , it is clear that @xmath24 accounts for the interferences .",
    "when @xmath24 vanishes the behavior of the gcd can be described as a classical markovian process . however in the generic case @xmath24 together with @xmath25 and @xmath26 are time depend functions that have long - time limiting values @xcite which are determined by the initial conditions of eq.([mapa ] ) .",
    "eq.([master ] ) can be solved in this limit .",
    "we define @xmath27and then we obtain the asymptotic stationary solution for the gcd as @xmath28 } = \\frac{1}{2}\\left [ \\begin{array}{c } 1 + 2\\mathrm{re}(q_{0})/\\tan \\theta   \\\\ 1 - 2\\mathrm{re}(q_{0})/\\tan \\theta \\end{array}\\right ] .   \\label{estacio}\\ ] ] this interesting result for the qw shows that the long - time probability to find the system with left or right chirality has a limit .",
    "therefore , although the dynamical evolution of the qw is unitary , the evolution of its gcd has an asymptotic limit characteristic of a diffusive behavior .",
    "this situation is further surprising if we compare our case with the case of the qw on finite graphs @xcite where it is shown that there is no converge to any stationary distribution .",
    "the concept of entanglement is an important element in the development of quantum communication , quantum cryptography and quantum computation . in this context",
    "several authors have investigated the relation between asymptotic entanglement and the initial conditions of the qw carneiro , abal , annabestani , omar , pathak , petulante , venegas , endrejat , ellinas1,ellinas2,maloyer .",
    "other authors @xcite have proposed to use the qw as a tool for quantum algorithm development and as an entanglement generator potentially useful to test quantum hardware .",
    "the unitary evolution of the qw generates entanglement between the coin and position degrees of freedom . to characterize this entanglement we start with the von neumann entropy which is quantum analogue of the gibbs entropy",
    "@xmath29where @xmath30 is the density matrix of the quantum system . due to the unitary dynamics of the qw",
    "the system remains in a pure state and this entropy vanishes .",
    "however for these pure states the entanglement between the chirality and the position can be quantified by the associated von neumann entropy for the reduced density operator carneiro , abal that defines the entropy of entanglement @xmath31 where @xmath32 and the partial trace is taken over the positions . using the wave function eq.([spinor ] ) and",
    "its normalization properties we obtain the reduced density operator @xcite @xmath33 the density operator @xmath34 has the eigenvalues @xmath35 .",
    "\\label{lam}\\ ] ] then the entanglement entropy eq.([dos ] ) is expressed through these two eigenvalues as @xmath36 in the asymptotic regime @xmath37 the eigenvalues go to a stationary limit , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "\\label{lam0}\\ ] ] further from eq.([estacio ] ) follows the relation @xmath40 which is substituted in eq.([lam0 ] ) , and then the asymptotic eigenvalues are expressed as @xmath41 with @xmath42 note that the values of the interference term @xmath43 are constrained to satisfy the condition @xmath44 and then @xmath45     as a function of the dimensionless parameter @xmath46 . from the top to the bottom",
    "they are : in thick line @xmath47 , in dashed line the entropy @xmath48 , in thin line the energy @xmath49 and in dashed - dot line the helmholtz free energy @xmath50 . ]",
    "the entanglement entropy has an asymptotic limit too @xmath51 that only depends on the initial conditions through the interference term @xmath43 .",
    "therefore we are led to consider that after some transient time the qw achieves a thermodynamic equilibrium between the position and chirality degrees of freedom . in order to make a fuller description of this equilibrium",
    "it is necessary to connect the eigenvalues of @xmath52 with its associated hamiltonian operator @xmath53 . to obtain this connection we shall use the quantum brownian motion model of ref.@xcite .",
    "we considered the system associated with the chirality degrees of freedom and characterized by the density matrix @xmath52 in thermal contact ( entanglement ) with the bath system associated with the position degrees of freedom , the lattice . in this context",
    "@xmath52 satisfies the equation @xmath54+\\gamma \\rho_{c } , \\label{scho}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 $ ] is the commutator and @xmath56 represents the brownian motion of @xmath52 induced by the noise ( fluctuating forces ) exerted on @xmath52 by the lattice ( position degrees of freedom ) . in the equilibrium ( stationary )",
    "situation we must have @xmath57 and @xmath58 @xcite , that is @xmath59=0 .",
    "\\label{scho2}\\ ] ] therefore , in the asymptotic regime , the density operator @xmath34 must be an explicit function of the hamiltonian operator which must be time independent .",
    "now we call @xmath60 the eigenfunctions of the density matrix , and then the operators @xmath61 and @xmath34 are both diagonal in this basis . therefore , the eigenvalues @xmath62 and @xmath63 depend of the corresponding eigenvalues of @xmath53 .",
    "we take these eigenvalues to be @xmath64 without any loss of generality , they represent the possible values of the entanglement energy .",
    "this interpretation agrees with the fact that @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the probabilities that the system is in the eigenstate @xmath65 or @xmath66 .",
    "the precise dependence between @xmath67 and @xmath68 is determined by the type of ensemble we construct .",
    "the main proposal of this paper is that this equilibrium corresponds to a quantum canonical ensemble .",
    "therefore we propose that @xmath69 which defines the entanglement temperature @xmath70 .",
    "then the probability that the state chosen at random from the ensemble @xmath71 , @xmath66 } , possesses an energy @xmath72 is determined by the boltzmann factor @xmath73 .",
    "let us call @xmath74 the diagonal expression of the density operator @xmath34 , then @xmath75 this operator is formally the same density operator that corresponds to an electron with possesses an intrinsic spin and a magnetic moment in a external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "starting from eq.([rhoni ] ) it is possible to build the thermodynamics for the qw entanglement .",
    "the partition function of the system is then given by @xmath76 accordingly , and also using eqs.([lam0],[lam2 ] ) , the temperature is given by @xmath77 the helmholtz free energy by @xmath78=\\frac{t}{2}\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{4}-\\chi\\right ) ,   \\label{betaa}\\ ] ] the internal energy by @xmath79 and finally the entropy by @xmath80 where this last thermodynamic definition for the entropy of course agrees with the previous shannon expression in eq.([s0 ] ) . to finished this section in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] we present the dependence of these thermodynamic magnitudes with the interference parameter @xmath81 .",
    "and @xmath82 .",
    "due to the rotation symmetry in the angle @xmath83 , only four zones are distinguished : two `` cold '' and two `` hot '' .",

    "the system showed a negligible transient dynamics , in concordance with the calculation developed in ref .",
    "therefore , for these initial conditions , the reduced density matrix is essentially always in thermodynamic equilibrium .    with the aim to understand the transient behavior of the system we develop an analytic theory implementing a parallelism between the reduced density operator eq.([rhoni ] ) and the density operator of an electron in a external magnetic field . with this picture on mind",

    "finally it is important to point out that the asymptotic behavior found here is similar to the behavior of the simple cellular automaton known as _ sandpile _ @xcite .",
    "such behaviors are characteristic of extended dynamical systems with spatial degrees of freedom .",
    "they naturally evolve to self - organized states with correlations that decay with a power law .",
    "the unitary evolution of the qw in a composite hilbert space is studied .",
    "in particular the entanglement between chirality and position degrees of freedom is investigated . after a transient time",
    "the system establishes a stationary entanglement between the coin and the position that allows to develop a thermodynamic theory .",
    "the asymptotic reduced density operator is used to introduce the entanglement thermodynamic functions in the canonical equilibrium .",
    "these thermodynamic functions characterize the asymptotic entanglement .",
    "it is shown that the qw initial condition determines the system s temperature , as well as other thermodynamic function . a map for the isotherms is analytically built for arbitrary localized initial conditions .",
    "additionally , it is shown that choosing appropriately the bias of the coin - toss , it is possible to obtain a predetermined entanglement temperature .",
    "the transient dynamics of the reduced density operator outside the thermodynamic equilibrium is also studied .",
    "we show numerically that this transient behavior can be adjusted with a power law , whose exponent depends on the initial conditions .",
    "we built a master equation to describe this behavior where the population rates have a time dependence .",
    "the accuracy of the master equation solution is numerically verified and it is shown that the reduced density has a cellular automaton behavior .    the behavior of the reduced density operator looks diffusive but it has a dependence with the initial conditions , the global evolution of the system is unitary .",
    "then , if an observer only had information related with the chirality degrees of freedom , it would be very difficult for him to recognize the unitary character of the quantum evolution .",
    "in general , from this simple model we can conclude that if the quantum system dynamics is developed in a composite hilbert space , then the behavior of operators that only belong to one sub - space could camouflage the unitary character of the global evolution .",
