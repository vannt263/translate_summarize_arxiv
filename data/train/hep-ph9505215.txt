    "most hadrons found experimentally have been identified as mesons ( @xmath1 ) or baryons ( @xmath2 ) and their masses and decays can be described fairly well in various quark models . however , there are still a few so - called exotic mesons which can not be interpreted as @xmath1 states . for the lightest exotic mesons @xmath3 and @xmath4 an underlying @xmath0 structure ( or @xmath5 molecule ) , besides other interpretations ( e.g. @xcite ) , has been discussed @xcite , but could not been proved yet unambiguously .",
    "recent experiments and data has renewed the interest in these exotic states @xcite .    we will discuss the existence of bound @xmath6 states within a non - relativistic constituent quark model , which was successfully used to describe meson and baryon mass spectra @xcite and decays . we can compare the states of this four particle problem with uncorrelated two - meson states and thus obtain a first clue whether the calculated states in reality would be bound or dissociated .",
    "in addition , the model is just simple enough to make the calculation of this real four particle problem possible .",
    "we consider the three lightest quark flavours @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where the constituent quark masses of @xmath10 and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 stands for a @xmath7 or @xmath8 ) are assumed to differ .",
    "the potential part of the hamiltonian consists of a sum of two - body forces .",
    "this contains a long range , colourdependent confinement part and a short range instanton induced interaction , which is generalized to three flavours @xcite .",
    "the hamiltoninan was calculated in a full basis of solutions of the @xmath11-dimensional harmonic oscillator .",
    "solving the eigenvalue problem and by a variational principle yield the mass spectra and the corresponding eigenstates for further examination of the internal structure of the states .",
    "for calculating the @xmath0 states , we used a hamiltonian of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the sum of the four constituent quark masses and @xmath14 the kinetic energy for the relative motion .",
    "as confinement potential @xmath15 , we choosed a linear rising potential with the relative quark-(anti)quark distance : @xmath16 the offset @xmath17 and the slope @xmath18 are different for @xmath19 and @xmath1 confinement . as noted in @xcite @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    "are not independent .",
    "the dependence of @xmath22 from @xmath21 is given by geometrical reasons  @xcite .",
    "the following relations should hold : @xmath23 although the parameters were independently varied , the above relations in the present approach are fullfilled with great accuracy .",
    "they are given in table  [ para ] .",
    "we consider two different kind of colour dependencies @xmath24 of @xmath15 , which in the meson or baryon case are identical . in the first case , @xmath24 is identical to the colour singlett projector @xmath25 @xcite : @xmath26 whereas in the other case we have : @xmath27 with @xmath28 is a gell - man matrix .",
    "the @xmath29 potential acts only on colour singletts . in the case of @xmath0",
    "only the four @xmath1 pairs will be affected .",
    "since it is an purely attractive potential two distinct @xmath1 colour singlett states ( which we call quasi - mesons ) will always have a net attraction , because also @xmath1 pairs with @xmath30 and @xmath31 from different quasi - mesons have always colour singlett contributions yielding unwanted long range forces .",
    "the @xmath32 potential has a better behaviour for @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the distance of the two quasi - mesons .",
    "as was shown @xcite , it goes with @xmath35 as @xmath34 grows large which is a consequence of the repulsive part of @xmath32 , which is an effect without experimental evidence .",
    "in addition @xmath32 allows a better comparison with earlier results of other authors @xcite .",
    "finally , @xmath36 is the residual quark-(anti)quark interaction .",
    "the @xmath37 term is of the form @xmath38 where the flavour matrix @xmath39 is shown in table  [ gqq ] , @xmath40 are spin projectors on the relative @xmath19 spin state and @xmath41 denotes a colour projector .",
    "@xmath42 is the relative distance of the two quarks .",
    "the @xmath43 term is of the same form , if one changes all colour to anticolours and all flavour to their antiflavour indices .",
    "all @xmath1 terms are of the form @xmath44 where the flavour depending @xmath45 is given in table  [ gqq ] ( for the calculation of this residual interaction from an effective lagrangian see @xcite ) .    the matrices @xmath39 and @xmath45 include the total flavour dependence of @xmath46",
    ". as one can see from table  [ gqq ] , @xmath39 contains a projector on flavour antisymmetric states , while @xmath45 generates a flavour mixing for @xmath47 states , which allows to describe the @xmath48-@xmath49 splitting in the meson case , and lowers the energy of the isovector state .",
    "the more complicated structure of @xmath46 for @xmath0 in comparison to the meson or baryon case is a consequence of the fact that there exist two distinct colour singletts for @xmath0 and consequently the terms including @xmath50 or @xmath51 do not vanish .",
    "the residual interaction is a pure contact force and as such leads to an unbound hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , we have chosen to regularize the interaction by replacing the @xmath52 distribution by a gaussian @xmath53 where @xmath54 can be interpreted as an effective range of the pairing force .",
    "we note that a derivation of the t hooft force going beyond the one loop approximation which was used , is expected to such a finite range  @xcite .    for the calculation of the @xmath0 mass spectra and the eigenstates ,",
    "we proceed as follows : the matrix elements of the hamiltonian  ( [ hamil ] ) are calculated within a spin - flavour @xmath55 , @xmath56 oscillator basis for each relative coordinate comprising @xmath57 oscillator excitations in total .",
    "we should note that this size of the model space is still too small for reaching convergence of the spectra .",
    "calculations with @xmath58 oscillator excitation were limited by the calculational effort however , the comparison with meson calculations shows that the lowest eigenvalues are calculated with an accuracy of a few mev .",
    "we obtained the @xmath0 spectra by application of the variational principle , i.e. diagonalisation of the hamiltonian in the oscillator basis and minimization of the lowest energy eigenvalue with respect to the oscillator length parameter .",
    "this is consistent to the earlier meson and hadron calculations in  @xcite .",
    "the parameters entering the present calculation are given in table  [ para ] .",
    "these parameter were fitted to the meson and baryon spectra .",
    "fig .  [ spec ] shows the mass spectra in the most interesting scalar isoscalar and isovector channel .",
    "the columns for each channel are devided into four subcolumns , which show from left to right the sum of the experimental masses of two mesons , the sum of two meson masses calculated with the the same model in the meson sector , the calculated @xmath0 spectra with @xmath29 and , finally , the spectra calculated with @xmath32 . in addition , the very left subcolumns shows the masses of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the most popular @xmath0 candidates .",
    "the @xmath0 eigenvalues are denoted by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the total spin , @xmath61 the total angular momentum and @xmath62 resp .",
    "@xmath63 the exchange symmetrie of @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath66 with @xmath67 respectively .",
    "@xmath10 counts all states with identical @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the two meson - state masses , which are compared with the @xmath0 spectra , are choosen to have the same observable quantum numbers as the @xmath0 states with the two mesons in a relative @xmath9-wave .",
    "a main diffiulty of our @xmath0 model is , that we can not describe two free mesons in a finite model space with a finite number of oscillator excitations .",
    "otherwise , it would be impossible to calculate the hamiltonian .",
    "it is therefore neccessary to examine the internal structure of the @xmath0 states in detail to differentiate real bound @xmath6 states from quasi free two meson states .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "[ spec ] , the @xmath6 spectra describe in good approximation the lowest two meson mass sum for the spectra calculated with the @xmath29 potential .",
    "the lowest state @xmath68 lies under the @xmath69 treshold which is due to the strong long range meson - meson attraction from the @xmath29 potential . since we consider this long range attraction to be unphysical ,",
    "this does not imply that @xmath68 is in reality a bound @xmath0 state .",
    "the eigenstates calculated with the @xmath32 , especially the lowest one , have higher energies due to the repulsive part of this potential .    as a consequence of the discretization of the two meson continuum in our variational approach ,",
    "both spectra contain more eigenstates in the energy region shown than the sum of the masses of two mesons ( with the two mesons in a @xmath9-wave ) would predict .",
    "in other words , the spectra alone do not allow to draw any conclusions wether there exist any `` real '' @xmath0 bound states within this model or not .",
    "a closer examination of the internal structure of the calculated eigenstates is therefore neccessary .",
    "to obtain such a closer view of the interpretation of the internal structure of the calculated @xmath0 states , we calculated various probability densities .",
    "let us consider the lowest eigenstate @xmath68 .",
    "( unless stated otherwise we refer to the calculation with the @xmath29 potential . )",
    "[ densnmax ] shows the densities for the various relative distances with @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "these densities were calculated by summing over all internal quantum numbers and integrating the @xmath0 probability density @xmath72 over all relative coordinates except the relative distance under investigation , with @xmath73 denoting a relative coordinate ( e.g. the @xmath30-@xmath31-distance ) and @xmath74 a multiindex for all internal quantum numbers .",
    "the @xmath1 distribution is calculated as : @xmath75 since all four pairs have the same distribution .",
    "it is observed that all densities in fig .",
    "[ densnmax ] are spreading with growing @xmath76 .",
    "while the @xmath30-@xmath31 distance ( or inner quasi - meson radius ) distribution keeps its form , the @xmath1-@xmath1 ( or quasi - meson ) distance distribution is mostly spread and its form seems to go over in a uniform distribution with rising @xmath76 , only slightly modified by the long range part of the @xmath29 potential , as mentioned above .    for higher excited states the @xmath1-@xmath1 distribution gets more complex and broader",
    "while the @xmath30-@xmath31 distribution again ist mostly localised , and the same conclusions as above can be drawn .",
    "comparison with the distribution of @xmath77-meson radius within the same model shows that it has nearly the same form as the @xmath30-@xmath31 distribution of the lowest @xmath6 state @xmath68 ( see fig .",
    "[ densnmax ] ) .    at last , we considered the distribution @xmath78 of a single quark on the @xmath79-axis given by : @xmath80 where @xmath81 are the absolute coordinates of the ( anti-)quarks .",
    "the first @xmath52-function ensures that the center of mass is identical with the center of the coordinate system , and @xmath82 cancels the integration over @xmath83 ; @xmath84 is defined by : @xmath85 surprisingly , the @xmath78 depends only very weakly on @xmath76 , so we can neglect this dependence for a qualitive analysis .",
    "the distribution has a quite sharp maximum at @xmath86 and two significant shoulders at @xmath87 .",
    "if we make the assumption , that we have a superposition of two gaussian - like quasi - meson distributions with their maxima seperated by a distance @xmath88 , we would expect a distribution of the form @xmath89 so we would expect a gaussian which is modulated by a cosh - function . now it is possible to write @xmath78 in the form @xmath90 where the width @xmath91 is a flavour dependent constant .",
    "the coefficient functions @xmath92 corresponding to the gaussian expansion ( [ gaussexp ] ) are shown in the fig .",
    "[ koeff ] .",
    "it is clear to see , that for @xmath93 the coefficients which give the important contributions to the sum behave much like @xmath94 functions .",
    "this gives evidence that the @xmath68 state in fact describes two free quasi - mesons and is not a bound @xmath0 system .",
    "although the contributions of the different flavour components change , this picture is qualitatively still correct if one considers the next higher excited states , also for the @xmath95 .",
    "that means , _ all _ states could be most - likely described as free quasi - mesons .",
    "the little local maximum of the @xmath96 coefficient in fig .",
    "[ koeff ] may indicate that there exist a meson - meson attraction for small distances , which is , however , too weak to lead to a bound system .",
    "we have extended a model , which is well established in the meson and baryon sector , to @xmath0 systems , without any change in the interaction .",
    "the interpretation of the results was not easy , because of the difficulty to distinguish @xmath0 from bound states and quasi - free mesons .",
    "on the basis of the internal structure , i.e. the density for a single quark and its representation as a sum of gaussians , we believe , however , to have found a good method to identify possible @xmath0 states in spite of the background of quasi - free meson states .    on the basis of results presented in this contribution",
    ", the only plausible interpretation is that _ all _ states we calculated correspond to quasi - free mesons .",
    "especially , we found no hint that there exist very tightly bound states of two quarks and two antiquarks .",
    "however , this does not yet rule out , that the @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons are @xmath5 molecular states , bound by long range forces , as provided e.g. by meson exchange @xcite .",
