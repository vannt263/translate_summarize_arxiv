    "they arise from the dimension - five operator @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the 1 higgs doublet and @xmath4 is a lepton doublet  @xcite .",
    "nothing is known from first principles about the mechanism that induces this operator , its associated mass scale or flavour structure .",
    "its most popular realization is the seesaw mechanism  @xcite which induces small neutrino masses from the exchange of heavy states , as expected in unified models .",
    "in addition to the standard 1 doublet higgs multiplet whose vacuum expectation value ( vev ) generates gauge boson and charged fermion masses , the full seesaw model ( now called type - ii as opposed to the original terminology in @xcite ) , contains higgses transforming as 1 singlet and triplet , carrying 2 units of lepton number , and with vevs @xmath5 obeying @xmath6 with @xmath7 ( i=1,2,3 correspond to singlet , doublet and triplet , respectively ) . the resulting perturbative description of the seesaw is first given in the second paper in  @xcite , while its _ effective _ model - independent low - energy description involves a 3@xmath86 charged current lepton mixing matrix which has 24 parameters .",
    "these correspond to 12 mixing angles and 12 cp phases ( both dirac and majorana - type ) , given in  @xcite  ( first paper ) .",
    "some of these parameters are involved in leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "current neutrino oscillation data are well described by the _ simplest _ ( unitary approximation to the ) lepton mixing matrix neglecting cp violation . here",
    "i focus mainly on the determination of neutrino mass and mixing parameters in neutrino oscillation studies , a currently thriving industry  @xcite , with many new experiments underway or planned .",
    "the interpretation of the data requires good solar and atmospheric neutrino flux calculations  @xcite , neutrino cross sections and experimental response functions , and a careful description of matter effects  @xcite in the sun and the earth .    in the early eighties it was",
    "also argued that , on quite _ general _ grounds , well beyond the details of the seesaw mechanism , massive neutrinos should be majorana particles  @xcite , leading to l - violating processes such as . after summarizing the status of 3-neutrino oscillation parameters",
    "i briefly discuss their impact on future searches  @xcite .",
    "the solar neutrino data includes the measured rates of the chlorine experiment at the homestake mine ( @xmath9  snu ) , the most up - to - date gallium results of sage ( @xmath10  snu ) and gallex / gno ( @xmath11  snu ) , as well as the 1496day super - k data in the form of 44 bins ( 8 energy bins , 6 of which are further divided into 7 zenith angle bins ) .",
    "the sno data include the most recent data from the salt phase in the form of the neutral current ( nc ) , charged current ( cc ) and elastic scattering ( es ) fluxes , as well as the 2002 spectral day / night data ( 17 energy bins for each day and night period ) .",
    "the analysis methods are described in  @xcite and references therein .",
    "we use a generalization of the pull approach for the @xmath12 calculation originally suggested in ref .",

    "our generalized method is exact to all orders in the pulls and covers the case of correlated statistical errors  @xcite as necessary to treat the sno ",
    "salt experiment .",
    "this is particularly interesting as it allows us to include the standard solar model @xmath13b flux prediction as well as the sno nc measurement on the same footing , without pre - selecting a particular value , as implied by expanding around the predicted value : the fit itself chooses the best compromise between the sno nc data and the ssm prediction .",
    "kamland detects reactor anti - neutrinos at the kamiokande site by the process @xmath14 , where the delayed coincidence of the prompt energy from the positron and a characteristic gamma from the neutron capture allows an efficient reduction of backgrounds .",
    "most of the incident @xmath15 flux comes from nuclear plants at distances of @xmath16 km from the detector , far enough to probe the lma solution of the solar neutrino problem .",
    "the neutrino energy is related to the prompt energy by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the neutron - proton mass difference and @xmath19 is the positron mass . for lower energies",
    "there is a relevant contribution from geo - neutrino events to the signal  @xcite . to avoid large uncertainties associated with the geo - neutrino flux an energy cut at 2.6  mev prompt",
    "energy is applied for the oscillation analysis .",
    "first kamland data corresponding to a 162 ton - year exposure gave 54 anti - neutrino events in the final sample , after all cuts , while @xmath20 events are predicted for no oscillations with @xmath21 background events .",
    "the probability that the kamland result is consistent with the no  disappearance hypothesis is less than 0.05% .",
    "this gave the first evidence for the disappearance of neutrinos traveling to a detector from a power reactor and the first terrestrial confirmation of the solar neutrino anomaly .    with a somewhat larger fiducial volume of the detector",
    "an exposure corresponding to 766.3  ton - year ( including a reanalysis of the previous 2002 data ) has been given  @xcite .",
    "in total 258 events have been observed , versus @xmath22 reactor neutrino events expected in the case of no disappearance and @xmath23 background events .",

    "kamland data are in beautiful agreement with the region implied by the lma solution to the solar neutrino problem , which in this way has been singled out as the only viable one in contrast to the previous variety of oscillation solutions  @xcite .",

    "the dip in the @xmath31 distribution of the atmospheric @xmath32 survival probability seen in super - k gives a clearer signature for neutrino oscillations .",
    "the analysis summarized below includes the most recent charged - current atmospheric neutrino data from super - k , with the @xmath33-like and @xmath30-like data samples of sub- and multi - gev contained events grouped into 10 zenith - angle bins , with 5 angular bins of stopping muons and 10 through - going bins of up - going muon events .",

    "this data sample contains mainly muon events from the quasi - elastic scattering @xmath42 , and the reconstructed energy is closely related to the true neutrino energy .",

    "it is reasonable to fit the data divided into 15 bins in reconstructed neutrino energy .",
