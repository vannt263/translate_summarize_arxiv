    "metastability is a feature commonly displayed by dynamical systems  @xcite .",
    "one of its simplest manifestation is in the context of finite - dimensional systems whose evolution is governed by the so - called overdamped langevin equation , that is , steepest descent over a given energy subject to thermal fluctuations modeled by an additive white - noise driving term . in such systems , if the energy landscape possesses several local minima separated by barriers much higher than the available thermal energy , with high probability the solution will spend a long time in a basin associated with the energy minimum before making a transition to another such basin .",
    "the time scale of these transitions follows the arrhenius law , i.e. it is exponentially large in the energy barrier the system must surmount to escape the basin , measured in units of temperature .",
    "this prediction can be confirmed rigorously using freidlin - wentzell large deviation theory  @xcite , which also predicts the mechanism of the transitions .",
    "more refined estimates for the transition time that include its prefactor can be obtained using e.g.  the potential theoretic approach to metastability introduced by bovier and collaborators  @xcite , and extended by many others  @xcite .",
    "these results can be extended to infinite - dimensional dynamical systems , e.g. the stochastic allen - cahn equation  @xcite .",
    "they can also be extended to other types of dynamics , e.g.  if inertial effects are included . in this case , the system s evolution can be modeled by the ( inertial ) langevin equation , that is , hamilton s equations in which a linear damping term and a white - noise forcing term are added in the equation for the momenta .",
    "more complicated is the case of hamiltonian systems in which there is no damping nor thermal noise , since the dynamics of such systems is conservative and deterministic .",
    "still , metastability can arise in this context as well .",
    "this is most easily pictured in finite dimensional systems , assuming that the constant energy surface the system is evolving upon consists of two large regions connected by a narrow bottleneck : this arises e.g.  if the total energy of the system is only slightly higher than the potential energy barrier between two regions in position space . if the dynamics is ergodic , the system can and will eventually cross this bottleneck , but in order to do so it must give up most of its kinetic energy to overcome the potential energy , which is highly unlikely to happen .",
    "this picture is intuitively appealing , though it may be hard to justify rigorously since ergodicity is typically very hard to prove . on top of this",
    ", it also becomes harder to use and justify as the dimensionality of the system under consideration increases .",
    "indeed , energy typically is an extensive property that grows with the system s size , meaning that large systems always have much more energy that what is needed to cross a given potential energy barrier .",
    "in particular , the picture above seems to become moot for infinite - dimensional hamiltonian systems , since their total energy can be infinite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate metastability in the context of one such system .",
    "specifically , we will study the nonlinear one - dimensional wave equation for @xmath7 @xmath8 for @xmath9 $ ] , with either dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions at @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and @xmath12 for some @xmath13 as @xmath4 . in",

    "[ sec : equivalence ] .",
    "the fact that   is the only natural invariant measure for   is intriguing : indeed , in finite dimensions , hamiltonian systems possess two different invariant measures , the microcanonical and the canonical ones , and if their dynamics are ergodic , it can only be so with respect to the former since their evolution is energy - conserving  @xcite .",
    "what therefore happens to the microcanonical measure in the context of the wave equation ?",
    "the equivalence of invariant measure for the energy conserving wave equation in   and its langevin counterpart in   also raises another question : do other features of their dynamics coincide , in particular those related to metastability",
    "?    we will address both these questions here .",
    "regarding the first , we will consider finite dimensional truncations of the wave equation based on the hamiltonian defined as @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 for @xmath28 , we denote @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are fixed by some boundary conditions .",
    "these finite dimensional truncations do indeed possess both the microcanonical and the canonical measures ( see and   below ) as invariant measures .",
    "however we will show in proposition  [ prop:1 ] below that _ both the microcanonical measure on the energy shell @xmath33 and the canonical measure at inverse temperature @xmath34 associated with the truncated hamiltonian in   converge to the same canonical measure in   as the size @xmath35 of the truncation tends to infinity .",
    "_ this result will be proven in the context of quadratic potentials @xmath2 but should hold also for more general potentials . note that the scaling @xmath36 implies that the energy of the discretized solutions converge to infinity as @xmath37 .",
    "the inverse temperature @xmath34 in   controls the concentration of the invariant measure around the minimizers of the hamiltonian  .",
    "this concentration of measure suggests that the system s dynamics can display metastability if @xmath2 is a double well potential , like e.g. @xmath38 , since in that case the hamiltonian   has two minimizers : these are @xmath39 and @xmath40 where @xmath41 are the solutions to @xmath42 that minimize the potential energy @xmath43 defined in  . for @xmath38 and neumann boundary condition , these are simply @xmath44 , and they can be similarly obtained for dirichlet boundary conditions ( see fig .

    "fig : solutions ] below ) .",
    "we will show in proposition  [ prop : concentration ] that the measure in   concentrates around these minimizers @xmath45 as @xmath46 , therefore suggesting that the solutions to   spend long periods of time around one before making a transition to the vicinity of the other .    as a means to quantify this behavior and answer the second question raised above , we will compute the mean frequency , averaged over initial conditions drawn from the invariant measure  , at which the solutions to   make transitions between two regions that each contain @xmath47 and @xmath48 and partition its phase - space . specifically",

    "this will allow us to obtain asymptotic expressions for the average residency times @xmath63 and @xmath64 on either side of @xmath58 , defined as @xmath65 where @xmath66 the asymptotic expressions for @xmath67 we will arrive at are @xmath68 here , @xmath69 denote the energy barriers between the minima and the saddle point and @xmath70 where @xmath71 are the eigenvalues of the operator   and @xmath72 those of @xmath73 in   the eigenvalues are enumerated such that @xmath74 whenever @xmath75 .",
    "note that the negative eigenvalue @xmath76 corresponding to the unstable direction of the saddle solution ( that is , associated with the eigenvector @xmath77 defined above ) is not included in the infinite product .",
    "note also that the infinite product in converges in one spatial - dimension , @xmath78 , but it does not for @xmath79 .",
    "this issue is consistent with the behavior of the spde in   which is well - posed for @xmath78 , but not for @xmath80  @xcite .",
    "interestingly the prediction in   for the residency times of the solutions to   coincide with the zero - damping limit of the residency times of the solutions to the langevin stochastic partial differential equation in  , since the latter are given by @xmath81    an interesting additional question is whether these results also apply for almost all initial conditions drawn from the invariant measure .",
    "this trajectory - wise comparison is nontrivial as it requires an assumption of ergodicity .",
    "below , we will investigate this assumption numerically .",
    "these computations suggest that the system s dynamics is indeed ergodic and rapidly mixing if the parameter @xmath6 is small enough : in this case , the residency times of every trajectory closely match that predicted by tst , and successive visits to @xmath82 and @xmath83 are roughly uncorrelated statistically .",
    "this means that the dynamics of   can be effectively coarse - grained to that of a two - state markov jump process with rates that can be deduced from the mean tst frequency .",
    "it also means that in this regime the dynamics of   is not fundamentally different from that of its stochastic counterpart in  , and in the latter we expect that the limits @xmath46 and @xmath84 commute .",
    "if the parameter @xmath6 is too large , however , either ergodicity breaks down , or the mixing time increases and becomes much larger than the inverse of the mean tst frequency . as a result ,",
    "successive visits in @xmath82 and @xmath83 become strongly correlated , and the coarse - graining of   to a two - state markov jump process fails . in this regime ,",
