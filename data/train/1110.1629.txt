    "similarly , comparing the mean color - excess inferred from various standard candles at a common zero - point ( e.g. , ic 1613 ) likewise enables a determination of the impact of metallicity on that parameter , although marginal differences may arise since classical cepheids ( population i objects ) are often located in dustier regions .",

    "however , a degeneracy emerges which complicates the analysis since the surface brightness and stellar density increase toward the central ( metal - rich ) regions , and thus photometric contamination ( blending / crowding ) becomes significant .",
    "indeed , it is argued here that the ( spurious ) brightening ( @xmath7 ) of extragalactic cepheids as a function of decreasing galactocentric distance @xcite is direct empirical evidence of photometric contamination .",

    "the impetus for the universal wesenheit template is to employ the statistical weight of the entire variable star demographic to establish precise distances , constrain pulsation modes , and to provide broader context to identify peculiarities among certain variables @xcite .",
    "the reddening - free nature of the wesenheit approach obviates the propagation of uncertainties tied to tentative total / differential extinction corrections , ensuring that further calibration may ensue directly from published or forthcoming geometric - based distances ( masers , hst , vlba , gaia ) .",

    "the ensuing metallicity corrected distances for the magellanic clouds are in significant disagreement with estimates from countless indicators ( table  [ table1 ] ) . in tandem with the evidence summarized in  [ s - m ] , the results indicate that variations in chemical composition among cepheids are a comparatively insignificant source of uncertainty for @xmath50-established distances and determinations of @xmath8 .",
    "metallicity corrections seem unnecessary for @xmath7-based distances , and consequently the observed apparent brightening ( @xmath7 ) of extragalactic cepheids with decreasing galactocentric distance @xcite likely stems from the associated increase in surface brightness and stellar density toward the galaxy center ( * ? ? ?",

    "furthermore , the results for m101 provide additional empirical constraints on photometric contamination ( blending / crowding ) , which in harmony with the challenges of establishing precise , standardized , multi - epoch , multi - band photometry : constitute a significant source of uncertainty for extragalactic cepheid distances .    future research shall aim to assess the viability of establishing classical cepheid calibrators from their membership in spiral arms , which are likewise delineated by young open clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the aforementioned classical cepheids exhibit pulsation periods of 14 and 28@xmath53 accordingly , and would bolster the longer period regime of the galactic calibration which is comparatively undersampled ( see @xcite or fig .  3 in * ? ? ?",
