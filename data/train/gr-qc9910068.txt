    "the zeroth and first laws of black hole mechanics refer to equilibrium situations and small departures therefrom .",
    "therefore , in the standard treatments @xcite one restricts oneself to stationary space - times admitting event horizons and perturbations off such space - times .",
    "while this simple idealization is a natural starting point , from physical considerations it seems overly restrictive .",
    "( see @xcite and especially @xcite for a detailed discussion . ) .",
    "a framework , which is tailored to more realistic physical situations was introduced in @xcite and the zeroth and first laws were correspondingly extended in @xcite .",
    "this framework generalizes black hole mechanics in two directions .",
    "first , the notion of event horizons is replaced by that of ` isolated horizons ' ; while the former can only be defined retroactively , after having access to the entire space - time history , the latter can be defined quasi - locally .",
    "second , the underlying space - time need not admit any killing field ; isolated horizons need not be killing horizons .",
    "the static event horizons normally used in black hole mechanics @xcite and the cosmological horizons in de sitter space - times @xcite are all special cases of isolated horizons .",
    "however , because we can now admit gravitational and matter radiation , there are many more examples . in particular , while the space @xmath0 of static space - times admitting event horizons in the einstein - maxwell theory is finite dimensional , the space @xmath1 of space - times admitting isolated horizons is _ infinite _ dimensional @xcite .    in the discussion of zeroth and first laws in @xcite ,",
    "two restrictive assumptions were made .",
    "first , the horizon was assumed to be non - rotating .",
    "second , while a rather general class of matter fields was allowed , it was assumed that the only relevant charges i.e .",
    ", hair are the standard electric and magnetic ones . in this note , we will continue to work with non - rotating horizons but weaken the second assumption by allowing a dilaton field and a general coupling , parameterized as usual by a ( non - negative ) coupling constant @xmath2 . by setting @xmath3 ,",
    "one recovers the standard einstein - maxwell - klein - gordon system ( which was included in @xcite ) . for @xmath4 ( in units in which the string tension is set equal to one ) one obtains the action widely used in the study of the low energy limit of string theory . for all values of @xmath2",
    ", we will be able to extend the isolated horizon framework and prove the zeroth and first laws .",
    "the main challenge encountered in this extension is the following . in the standard treatment , static black holes in dilaton gravity",
    "are characterized by three parameters : the mass @xmath5 , the ( modified ) electric charge @xmath6 ( or , the magnetic charge @xmath7 ) and a dilaton charge @xmath8 . of these",
    ", @xmath5 and @xmath8 are defined at _ infinity _ ( while @xmath6 and @xmath7 , being absolutely conserved , can be defined on any 2-sphere ) . in the more general context of isolated horizons",
    ", gravitational radiation and matter fields may be present between the horizon and infinity .",
    "now @xmath5 and @xmath8 carry information about these fields and can no longer be regarded as intrinsic parameters of the horizon itself",
    ". therefore , the laws of mechanics can not refer to them ; we need new intrinsic parameters . in the einstein - maxwell case ,",
    "this was accomplished @xcite by replacing @xmath5 with the area @xmath9 of the isolated horizon @xmath10 ( in this case , @xmath11 ) .",
    "a natural strategy now is to continue to use @xmath9 in place of @xmath5 and use the value @xmath12 of the dilaton field _ on _ the horizon in place of @xmath8 .",
    "however , it is far from obvious that this strategy is viable",
    ". for , there are at least four conditions to meet .",
    "first , the isolated horizon boundary conditions should tell us that the field @xmath12 is constant on @xmath10 .",
    "second , we should be able to define surface gravity @xmath13 in absence of a killing field and show that it is constant on _ any _ isolated horizon , in spite of the fact that the values of fields such as the weyl component @xmath14 and the maxwell component @xmath15 can be ` dynamical ' on isolated horizons .",
    "third , to have a meaningful formulation of the first law , the hamiltonian strategy of @xcite for defining the mass @xmath16 of the isolated horizon should go through and enable us to express @xmath16 in terms only of the horizon parameters , in spite of the fact that values of fields such as @xmath14 and @xmath17 on @xmath10 are not determined by the horizon parameters .",
    "finally , the functional dependence of the horizon mass @xmath16 , the surface gravity @xmath13 and the electric potential @xmath18 on the horizon parameters @xmath19 ( or , @xmath20 ) and @xmath12 should be such that the first law holds . we will show that all these conditions can be met .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "for convenience of readers who may not be familiar with dilaton couplings , in section [ s2 ] we briefly recall the relevant results from literature . in section [ s3 ] , we specify the boundary conditions defining non - rotating isolated horizons in dilaton gravity and summarize their consequences which are needed for the main results",
    ". section [ s4 ] introduces surface gravity @xmath13 and establishes the zeroth law while section [ s5 ] introduces the mass @xmath16 and establishes the first law .",
    "since the underlying strategy in sections [ s4]and [ s5 ] is the same as in @xcite , we will use the same notation ( which , incidentally , differs in some minor ways from the conventions used in @xcite ) and refrain from repeating the detailed arguments and proofs given in @xcite .",
    "rather , we will recall the main conceptual steps and emphasize the new issues and subtleties that arise due to dilaton couplings .",
    "also , we will use this opportunity to make some new observations which hold also in cases considered in @xcite . finally ,",
    "while the earlier treatments were spinorial , in this paper , we will complement that discussion by working only with tensors .",
    "in dilaton gravity , ( in the so - called einstein frame ) the gravitational part of the action , @xmath21 is the standard one @xcite .",
    "the matter part of the action may be less familiar .",
    "it is given by : s_dil ( , a ) = -_m [ 2()^2 + e^-2_ab^ab]^4x[dil : act ] where @xmath22 is a free parameter which governs the strength of the coupling of the dilaton field @xmath23 to the maxwell field @xmath24 .",
    "since the action is invariant under simultaneous changes of sign of @xmath23 and @xmath2 , without loss of generality , one can restrict oneself to non - negative values of @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath25 , we recover the einstein - maxwell - klein - gordon system .",
    "the total action @xmath26 is given by s_tot = s_grav + s_dil .",
    "the equations of motion that follow from @xmath26 are : _ a ^^ab = 0,_a(e^-2^ab)=0,[dil : eom1 ] + ^2+e^-2 ^ 2=0 , [ dil : eom2 ] + r_ab= g , [ dil : eom3 ] where @xmath27 .    since @xmath28 by definition of @xmath29 , the magnetic charge , p[s ] :",
    "= _ s is absolutely conserved , i.e. , is independent of the particular choice of the 2-sphere @xmath30 , in a given homology class , made in its evaluation .",
    "note however that @xmath31 , whence the standard electric charge q_std : = _ s ^(with @xmath32 ) is _ not _ absolutely conserved .",
    "the effective current @xmath33 depends on the maxwell field itself and is given by @xmath34\\ , \\nabla_b \\phi\\ , f^{ab}$ ] .",
    "hence , @xmath35 satisfies a balance equation : q_std[s_1 ] - q_std[s_2]= _",
    "m_12 ^where @xmath36 is the 3-surface with boundaries @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "however , it is obvious from ( [ dil : eom1 ] ) that the 2-form @xmath39 is closed . therefore , there is in fact a conserved electric charge , _ cons[s]:=_s",
    "e^-2 ^ .again , @xmath40 $ ] depends only on the homology class of @xmath30 .",
    "finally , in the asymptotically flat context of primary interest to this paper , the requirement that the 4-momentum be finite leads one to a natural boundary condition on the dilaton field at spatial infinity : @xmath23 must approach a constant , @xmath8 .",
    "this constant provides a ` dilatonic charge ' @xmath8 associated with the solution .",
    "is generally defined only in stationary space - times .",

    "note that the values of @xmath43 $ ] , @xmath44 $ ] and @xmath8 are related via q_cons[s _ ] = e^-2 _ q_std[s _ ] so that , in the parameterization of the solution , one can replace @xmath8 with @xmath45 $ ] .    of special interest",
    "are two symmetries of the theory .",
    "the first is a natural generalization of the standard duality rotation of the maxwell theory : [ duality ] ( , _ ab , g_ab ) d ( , _ ab , g_ab ) = ( - , ^_ab , g_ab ) . as in the standard maxwell theory , the action fails to be invariant under this transformation since @xmath46 .",
    "however , it is obvious from the equations of motion that if @xmath47 is a solution , so is the duality rotated triplet @xmath48 .",
    "this fact is generally exploited to restrict oneself to the sector of the theory in which the magnetic charge vanishes : properties of solutions with a magnetic charge can be obtained simply by a duality rotation of the solution with a corresponding electric charge .",
    "is a _ discrete _ transformation and maps solutions with pure electric charge to those with pure magnetic charge .",
    "the analog of the continuous transformations @xmath49 parameterized by an angle @xmath50 of the einstein - maxwell theory does not seem to exist in dilaton gravity .",
    "furthermore , solutions with both electric and magnetic charge are known @xcite only for @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and they were _ not _ constructed using a symmetry of the theory . ]",
    "the second symmetry is continuous and corresponds to a constant shift in @xmath23 : [ trans ] ( , _ ab , g_ab ) ( , _ ab , g_ab ) = ( + k , k _ ab , g_ab ) where @xmath53 is a real constant .",
    "it is easy to see that this transformation leaves the action invariant and hence also maps solutions to solutions .",
    "this symmetry is often exploited to restrict oneself to the sector of the theory in which @xmath54 .",
    "again , properties of solutions with non - zero @xmath8 can be obtained by applying the appropriate map @xmath55 .    from now on , for notational simplicity , we set @xmath56 = { q}[s]$ ] and @xmath57      static , spherically symmetric solutions to dilaton gravity are special cases of a general class of black holes first discovered by gibbons @xcite and gibbons and maeda @xcite .",
    "( these solutions were independently discovered by garfinkle , horowitz and strominger @xcite . ) in the case @xmath4 , they are the unique static black hole solutions of dilaton gravity @xcite . for general @xmath2 , we will refer to them as the gibbons - maeda ( gm ) solutions .    by making an appeal to the duality rotation @xmath58 and the constant shift transformation @xmath55 ,",
    "one restricts oneself to the case in which the magnetic charge @xmath7 and the dilaton charge @xmath8 vanish .",
    "then , the general solution is conveniently parameterized by two numbers , @xmath59 ( with @xmath60 ) , related to the adm mass @xmath5 and conserved electric charge @xmath6 via : gm&=&+ + g^2 & = & the solution is given by : s^2&=&-^2t^2+^-2r^2+r^2 + * f*&=&tr , and + e^2&=&^2 ^ 2/(1+^2 ) . here",
    ", @xmath61 is a radial coordinate , related to the geometrical radius @xmath62 of 2-spheres spanned by the orbits of the rotational killing fields via r = r^^2/(1+^2 ) and @xmath63 is a function of @xmath61 , given by ^2=^(1-^2)/(1+^2 ) .",
    "when @xmath25 , the dilaton field @xmath23 vanishes and the solution reduces to the reissner - nordstrm solution of the einstein - maxwell theory .",
    "the case @xmath51 is of interest to string theory .",
    "for all @xmath2 , @xmath64 is an event horizon and for all _ non - zero _ values of @xmath2 , there is a curvature singularity at @xmath65 . for @xmath25 ,",
    "@xmath66 is a non - singular inner horizon .",
    "finally , the extremal black holes correspond to @xmath67 ( or @xmath68 ) .",
    "the horizon of these extremal black holes is singular except when @xmath25 .    in this 2-parameter family of black holes",
    ", one can directly compute the acceleration of the killing field @xmath69 ( with @xmath70 ) on the horizon to obtain an expression for the surface gravity @xmath13 .",
    "we have : [ kappa1 ] = ^(1-^2)/(1+^2 ) . from ( [ kappa1 ] )",
    "it is obvious that the zeroth law holds .",
    "furthermore , @xmath71 for all non - extremal black holes . in the extremal case , since the event horizon is singular unless @xmath25 , surface gravity is defined unambiguously only if @xmath3 ( and is zero in this case ) . however ,",
    "if @xmath72 , one can define @xmath13 by a limiting procedure and show that @xmath73 for @xmath72 and @xmath74 if @xmath51 .",
    "next , let us consider the first law .",
    "it is straightforward to check that , for any variation @xmath75 within this family of solutions , we have [ 1law1 ] = + , where @xmath76 is the area of the horizon and @xmath77 is the value of the natural scalar potential at the horizon .    to conclude ,",
    "let us return to the symmetry transformations .",
    "since the adm mass @xmath5 and the surface gravity @xmath13 are determined entirely by the metric and the metric does not change under @xmath58 or @xmath55 , neither do @xmath5 and @xmath13 . on the other hand , the electric and magnetic charges do change .",
    "the effect of @xmath58 is the same as in maxwell s theory .",
    "let us therefore focus on @xmath78 .",
    "let us begin with a gibbons - maeda solution @xmath79 and set @xmath80 .",
    "the resulting solution does not belong to the gibbons - maeda family since @xmath81 at infinity .",
    "the parameters of the new solution are @xmath82 .",
    "thus , the ( trivially ) generalized gibbons - maeda ( ggm ) solutions are characterized by _ three _ parameters , @xmath83 with @xmath84 and @xmath85 , rather than just two . in terms of these",
    ", the physical quantities associated with the black - hole are given by : m= m^o , a_hor = a_hor^o , = ^o , = ^o e^k and = ^o e^-k .",
    "consequently , for this family , the first law becomes : [ ggm1law ] & = & + + k + & = & + where @xmath86 ( i.e. @xmath87 $ ] ) and @xmath88 .",
    "we will return to these generalized gibbons - maeda solutions in sections [ s4 ] and [ s5 ] .",
    "we are now ready to consider situations which are not necessarily static and introduce the notion of isolated horizons @xmath10 for dilaton gravity .",
    "the basic boundary conditions defining @xmath10 are the same as those introduced in @xcite .",
    "however , we will use this opportunity to present them _ without _ recourse to spinors .",
    "while this formulation is less convenient for detailed calculations such as the ones performed in @xcite , it makes the meaning of the underlying assumptions more transparent .",
    "let us begin by introducing some notation .",
    "fix any null surface @xmath89 , topologically @xmath90 , and consider foliations of @xmath91 by families of 2-spheres transversal to its null normal . given a foliation , we parameterize its leaves by @xmath92 such that @xmath93 increases to the future and set @xmath94 . under a reparametrization @xmath95",

    "we can extend each @xmath100 to the full space - time uniquely by demanding that the extended 1-form be null .",

    "( thus , @xmath101 is future - pointing .",
    "if we change the parameterization , @xmath103 transforms via : @xmath104 .",
    "thus , given a foliation , we acquire an equivalence class @xmath105 $ ] of pairs , @xmath106 , of vector fields and 1-forms on @xmath91 subject to the relation @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is any positive function on @xmath91 which is constant on each leaf of the foliation . given a pair @xmath109 in the equivalence class ,",
    "we introduce a complex vector field @xmath110 on @xmath91 , tangential to each leaf in the foliation , such that @xmath111 .",
    "( by construction , @xmath112 on @xmath91 . )",
    "the vector field @xmath110 is unique up to a phase factor . with this structure at hand",
    ", we now introduce the main definition .    _ definition : _ the internal boundary @xmath10 of a space - time @xmath113 will be said to represent _ a non - rotating isolated horizon _ provided the following conditions hold will denote equality at points of @xmath10 . for fields defined throughout space - time , an under - arrow will denote pull - back to @xmath10 . the part of the newman - penrose framework @xcite used in this paper is summarized in the appendices a and b of @xcite . ] :    * \\(i ) _ manifold conditions : _",
    "@xmath10 is a null surface , topologically @xmath114 . *",

    "@xmath10 admits a foliation such that the newman - penrose coefficients associated with the corresponding direction fields @xmath115 $ ] on @xmath10 are subject to the following conditions : + ( iii.a ) @xmath116 , the expansion of @xmath117 $ ] , vanishes on @xmath10 .",
    "+ ( iii.b ) @xmath118 and @xmath119 vanish on @xmath10 and the expansion @xmath120 of @xmath99 is negative is everywhere positive on @xmath10 . see @xcite . ] and constant on each leaf of the foliation .",
    "* \\(iv ) _ conditions on matter : _ the maxwell field @xmath29 is such that _ 1 = m^a|m^b ( - i ^)_ab is constant on each leaf of the foliation introduced in condition ( iii ) .",
    "the first two conditions are quite tame : ( i ) simply asks that @xmath10 be null and have appropriate topology while ( ii ) is completely analogous to the dynamical condition imposed at infinity .",
    "as the terminology suggests , ( iii.a ) and ( iii.b ) are the most important conditions .",
    "note first that , if a pair @xmath121 in the equivalence class @xmath115 $ ] associated with the foliation satisfies these conditions , so does any other pair , @xmath122 .",
    "thus , the conditions are well - defined .",
    "they are motivated by the following considerations .",
    "condition ( iii.a ) captures the idea that the horizon is isolated without having to refer to a killing field .",
    "in particular , it implies that the area of each 2-sphere leaf in the foliation be the same .",
    "we will denote this area by @xmath9 and define the _ horizon radius _ @xmath123 via @xmath124 .",
    "( in previous papers @xcite , the horizon radius was denoted by @xmath125 .",
    "we have changed the notation to avoid possible confusion with the ( non - geometric ) radial coordinate @xmath61 generally used in the discussion of dilaton black holes . )",
    "condition ( iii.b ) has three sets of implications .",
    "first , one can show that if , as required , one can find a foliation of @xmath10 satisfying ( iii.b ) , that foliation is _",
    "unique_. ( in the ggm family , as one might expect , this condition selects the foliation to which the three rotational killing fields are tangential . )",
    "second , it implies that the imaginary part of ( the newman - penrose weyl component ) @xmath126 , which captures angular momentum , vanishes and thus restricts us to _ non - rotating _ horizons .",
    "third , the requirement that the expansion @xmath127 of @xmath128 be negative implies that @xmath10 is a _ future _ horizon rather than past @xcite . finally , consider the spherical symmetry requirement on the maxwell field component @xmath129 .",
    "while this condition is a strong restriction , it can be motivated as follows . conditions ( i )  ( iii ) imply that @xmath130 , the ` radiative part of the maxwell field traversing @xmath10 ' vanishes ( confirming the interpretation that @xmath10 is isolated ) . if the ` radial derivative ' of @xmath131 also vanishes at @xmath10 i.e .",
    ", heuristically , if there is no flux of electro - magnetic radiation across @xmath10 also to the next order condition ( iv ) is automatically satisfied .",
    "( for further motivation and remarks on these conditions , see @xcite . )",
    "note that there is no explicit restriction on the dilaton field at @xmath10 .",
    "since these conditions are _ local _ to @xmath10 , as indicated in the introduction , the notion of an isolated horizon is quasi - local ; in particular , one does not need an entire space - time history to locate an isolated horizon .",
    "furthermore , the boundary conditions allow for presence of radiation in the exterior region .",
    "therefore , space - times admitting isolated horizons need not admit any killing field @xcite .",
    "indeed , the space @xmath132 of solutions to field equations admitting isolated horizons is infinite dimensional .",
    "( strategies for construction of such solutions are discussed in @xcite ) .    in spite of this generality ,",
    "boundary conditions place surprisingly strong restrictions on the structure of various fields _ at _ @xmath10 .",
    "let us begin with conditions on the dilaton and maxwell fields .",
    "the stress - energy tensor @xmath133 of @xmath134 satisfies the dominant energy condition .",
    "hence , on @xmath10 , @xmath135 is a future directed , causal vector field .",
    "now , using the raychaudhuri equation and field equations _ at _ @xmath10 ( condition ( ii ) of the definition ) , we conclude @xmath136 . by expanding out this expression",
    "( see eq ( [ dil : eom3 ] ) ) we obtain [ 3.2 ] _  0 = _ 1 [ n - m|m ] + _ 2 [ m ] + cc for _ some _ complex functions @xmath129 and @xmath15 ( the newman - penrose components of @xmath29 ) on @xmath10 , where @xmath137 stands for ` the complex conjugate term ' .",
    "these equations say that that there is no flux of dilatonic or electro - magnetic radiation across @xmath10 .",
    "next , since @xmath138 is a future pointing causal vector and @xmath139 , it follows that @xmath140 .",
    "finally , the main conditions ( iii ) in the definition imply that @xmath141 @xcite and , since the field equations hold at @xmath10 , we conclude @xmath142 .",
    "this implies that the field @xmath23 is constant on @xmath10 .",
    "we will denote this constant by @xmath12 and refer to it as _ the dilatonic charge of the isolated horizon_. finally , condition ( iv ) in the definition implies _ 1 = e^2 _ _ , where @xmath12 is the value of the dilaton field on @xmath10 and @xmath143 is the conserved electric charge .",
    "thus the boundary conditions severely restrict the form of matter fields at @xmath10 .",
    "the dilaton field @xmath23 is constant on @xmath10 , the component @xmath144 of the maxwell field vanishes and the component @xmath129 is completely determined by the dilaton and ( conserved ) electric charge .",
    "however , the component @xmath15 of the electro - magnetic field is unconstrained .",
    "restrictions imposed on space - time curvature at @xmath10 are essentially the same as in ref @xcite .",
    "connection associated with the dyad @xmath145 .",
    "see @xcite . ]",
    "results relevant to this paper can be summarized as follows . in the newman - penrose notation , for the ricci tensor components , we have : [ ricci ] _ 00 & = & r_ab ^a^b = 0 , _ 01 = r_ab^a m^b = 0 , _ 02 = r_ab m^a m^b = 0 , + _ 11 & = & r_ab ( ^an^b + m^a|m^b ) = - 8 ^ 2 g e^2 _ ( ) ^2 , r = 0 , where @xmath62 is the scalar curvature .",

    "this structure is the same as in the ggm solutions discussed at the end of section [ s2 ] .",
    "however , on a general isolated horizon , other curvature components may be ` dynamical ' , i.e. , vary along the integral curves of @xmath101 .    in view of this structure of various fields on @xmath10 , it is natural to use the triplet @xmath146 the horizon radius , the conserved charge and the value of the dilaton field on the horizon to parameterize general isolated horizons . in the ggm solutions , these parameters are subject to the restriction @xmath147 . in the more general context of isolated horizons , we will restrict the range of parameters by the same condition . unlike the adm mass @xmath5 ,",

    "we will conclude this section with a remark .",
    "there exist in the literature other families of static , spherically symmetric solutions with maxwell and dilaton fields with killing horizons which , however , fail to be asymptotically flat ( or anti - de sitter ) @xcite . in the general case",
    ", the field equations they obey contain a potential term @xmath150 for the dilaton field and reduce to those given in section [ s2.1 ] only in the case when @xmath151 .",
    "however , for all potentials , our boundary conditions are satisfied at the killing horizons of these solutions ; thus those horizons are , in particular , isolated horizons .",
    "furthermore , for _ general _ isolated horizons in any of these theories , even without killing fields , all conclusions of this section continue to hold ( even though , for certain potentials @xmath150 , the stress - energy tensor does not satisfy the dominant energy condition ) .",
    "isolated horizons offer a natural home for such black holes since , unlike event horizons , they do not refer to the structure at infinity .",
    "in each ggm solution there is a unique time - translational killing field @xmath69 which is unit at infinity . as usual ,",

    "for each such @xmath101 , we can define the surface gravity @xmath160 _ relative to that _ @xmath101 via @xmath161 .",
    "rescaling of @xmath101 now induces to a ` gauge transformation ' in @xmath13 : @xmath162 .",
    "( recall that in the general newman - penrose framework , @xmath13 is a connection component and therefore undergoes the standard gauge transformations under a change of the null tetrad . by fixing @xmath101 up to a constant rescaling",
    ", we have reduced the general gauge freedom to that of a constant rescaling . )",
    "since the zeroth law only says that the surface gravity is constant on @xmath10 , if it holds for one @xmath101 , it holds for every @xmath163 .",
    "thus , for the zeroth law , it is in fact _ not _ essential to get rid of the rescaling freedom .",
    "recall that the isolated horizon is naturally equipped with equivalence classes @xmath115 $ ] of vector and co - vector fields , subject to the relation : @xmath164 for any positive function @xmath165 on @xmath10 .",
    "our first task is to reduce the freedom in the choice of @xmath166 to that of a constant .",
    "we use the same strategy as in @xcite .",
    "( for motivation , see @xcite . )",
    "recall that @xmath127 , the expansion of @xmath99 is strictly negative and constant on each leaf of the preferred foliation ; @xmath167 .",
    "it is easy to verify that n^a g(v ) n^a impliesg(v ) ( v ) .",
    "hence , we can _ always _ use the @xmath166 freedom to set @xmath168 .",
    "this condition restricts the family of @xmath121 pairs and reduces the equivalence relation to @xmath169 where @xmath158 is any constant on @xmath10 .",
    "we will denote the restricted equivalence class by @xmath115_r$ ] . in the second step",
    ", we will _ fix _ the numerical value of @xmath127 in terms of the parameters of the isolated horizon and eliminate the rescaling freedom altogether , thereby selecting a canonical pair @xmath109 on each isolated horizon .    with the equivalence class @xmath115_r$ ] at our disposal , as discussed above",
    ", we can define a surface gravity @xmath160 via @xmath170 .",
    "constancy of @xmath160 on @xmath10 follows from the same arguments that were used in @xcite . for completeness ,",
    "let us briefly recall the structure of that proof .",
    "first , using conditions on derivatives of @xmath171 introduced in the definition , one can express the self - dual part of the riemann curvature in terms of @xmath172 ( and another field which is not relevant to this discussion ) . comparing this expression to the standard newman - penrose expansion of the self - dual curvature tensor in terms of curvature scalars @xcite , and using the fact that certain curvature scalars vanish on @xmath10 ( see ( [ ricci ] ) and ( [ weyl ] ) )",
    ", one can conclude [ 4.13 ] _ n = 0 , _",
    "the first equation implies that @xmath160 is spherically symmetric .",
    "hence , it only remains to show that @xmath173 .",
    "since @xmath127 is now a constant on @xmath10 , it suffices to show that @xmath174 .",
    "now , the ( second ) bianchi identity implies that [ bi ] l_ ( _ 2 - _ 11 ) = 0 finally , using ( [ 3.2 ] ) and the fact that the dilaton field @xmath23 is constant on @xmath10 , we conclude : @xmath175 .",
    "thus , @xmath176 is constants on @xmath10 .",
    "combining these results , we conclude @xmath177 , whence @xmath160 is constant on @xmath10 .",
    "this establishes the zeroth law .    with an eye toward the first law ,",
    "let us now carry out the second step in fixing the normalization of @xmath101 .",
    "so far , we have only required that @xmath127 be a ( negative ) constant but not fixed its value . under the rescaling @xmath178 we have : @xmath179 , and @xmath180 .",
    "hence , the remaining rescaling freedom in @xmath101 and @xmath13 can be exhausted simply by fixing the value of @xmath127 in terms of the isolated horizon parameters .",
    "the obvious strategy is to fix @xmath127 to the value @xmath181 it takes on the ggm solutions .",
    "however , there is a practical difficulty : although @xmath181 is a well - defined function of the isolated horizon parameters @xmath182 and @xmath12 , to our knowledge , there is no closed expression for it in terms of these parameters .",
    "therefore , for computational convenience , let us first make a change of coordinates on the three dimensional parameter space @xmath183 defined by the triplet @xmath184 .",
    "introduce @xmath125 and @xmath185 via [ new ] r_&= & r _ ^^2/1+^2 + e^ _ & = & e^k_. it is easy to check that @xmath186 is a good set of coordinates on @xmath183 with ranges @xmath187 and @xmath188 . with these definitions , in the ggm solutions we have : r_= r_+,^2_= e^-2k , k_=k .",
    "however , from a conceptual point of view , on general isolated horizons @xmath184 are the fundamental parameters and @xmath186 are simply convenient functions of them defined via ( [ new ] ) . in particular , on a general isolated horizon , @xmath185 is unrelated to the value @xmath8 of the dilaton field at infinity .",
    "we are now ready to express @xmath181 of ( [ kappa1 ] ) in a closed form : [ mu ] _ ggm = - ^-1 therefore , for _ general isolated horizons _ we will gauge - fix @xmath101 by demanding that @xmath127 be given by the right side of ( [ mu ] ) . with this final ` gauge - fixing ' , @xmath101 is uniquely determined on each isolated horizon .",
    "we will denote the corresponding @xmath160 simply by @xmath13 and call it _ the surface gravity _ of the isolated horizon @xmath10 . using ( [ 4.13 ] ) , ( [ ricci ] ) and ( [ weyl ] ) and the expression ( [ mu ] ) of @xmath127 , we can express @xmath13 in terms of the isolated horizon parameters as [ kappa ] = r _ , where , as before , @xmath189 is the area of the horizon . by construction , in the ggm solutions , @xmath13 reduces to ( [ kappa1 ] ) .",
    "finally , as discussed in @xcite , to arrive at the standard form of the first law , we need to gauge fix the electro - magnetic potential @xmath190 .",
    "again , the strategy is similar to the one we used to gauge fix the normalization of @xmath101 : we first express @xmath191 in the ggm solutions in terms of the isolated horizon parameters and then ask that @xmath18 be the same function of the parameters in the general case .",
    "again , to obtain an expression of @xmath191 in a closed form , we are led to use @xmath192 .",
    "it is easy to verify that [ phi ] _ ggm = e^2k _ .",
    "hence , on general isolated horizons , we work in a gauge in which @xmath18 is given by the right side of ( [ phi ] ) . as in the einstein - maxwell case",
    "@xcite , this gauge fixing makes the matter action @xmath193 functionally differentiable even in presence of the internal boundary @xmath10 .",
    "we conclude this section with a remark .",
    "a general isolated horizon carries three independent parameters , @xmath194 , arising from the metric , maxwell and dilaton fields respectively .",
    "therefore , to unambiguously implement the above procedure to gauge - fix the normalization of @xmath101 , we needed access to a three parameter family of ` reference ' static solutions , one for each point in the parameter set .",
    "this is why it was essential to consider the generalization of the gibbons - maeda solutions to include non - zero values of @xmath8 .",
    "had we restricted ourselves to the original gibbons - maeda family , the mapping between the 3-dimensional parameter space @xmath183 and the space of static solutions would have been ambiguous . for the generalized gibbons - maeda family ,",
    "the mapping is 1 - 1 and hence unambiguous .",
    "as explained in the introduction , since space - times under consideration are not necessarily stationary , it is no longer meaningful to identify the adm mass @xmath5 with the mass @xmath16 of the isolated horizon . for the formulation of the first law ,",
    "therefore , we must first introduce an appropriate definition of @xmath16 .",
    "the hamiltonian framework provides a natural strategy . in the einstein - maxwell case",
    "the total hamiltonian consists of a bulk term and _ two _ surface terms , one at infinity and the other at the isolated horizon . as usual ,",
    "the bulk term is a linear combination of constraints and the surface term at infinity yields the adm energy . in a rest - frame adapted to the horizon",
    "it is then natural to identify the surface term at @xmath10 as the horizon mass , @xmath16 .",
    "indeed , there are several considerations that support this identification @xcite .",
    "we will use the same strategy in the dilatonic case .",
    "for the gravitational part of the action and hamiltonian , the discussion of @xcite only assumed that the stress - energy tensor satisfies two conditions at @xmath10 : i ) @xmath138 is a future pointing causal vector field on @xmath10 ; and , ii ) @xmath195 is spherically symmetric on @xmath10 .",
    "both these conditions are met in the present case .",
    "therefore , we can take over the results of @xcite directly . for the matter part of the action and hamiltonian ,",
    "the overall situation is again analogous , although there are the obvious differences in the detailed expressions because of dilaton couplings . as in the einstein - maxwell case ,",
    "matter terms contribute to the surface terms in the hamiltonian only because one has to perform one integration by parts to obtain the gauss constraint in the bulk term .",
    "the net result is the following .",
    "consider a foliation of the given space - time region @xmath196 by a 1-parameter family of ( partial ) cauchy surfaces @xmath5 , each of which extends from the isolated horizon @xmath10 to spatial infinity @xmath197 ( see figure ) .",
    "we will assume that @xmath5 intersects @xmath10 in a 2-sphere belonging to our preferred foliation and that the initial data induced on @xmath5 are asymptotically flat .",
    "denote by @xmath198 and @xmath199 the 2-sphere boundary of @xmath5 at the horizon and infinity , respectively .",
    "choose a time - like vector field @xmath69 in @xmath196 which tends to the unit time - translation orthogonal to the foliation at spatial infinity and to the vector field @xmath103 on @xmath10 , normalized as in section [ s4 ] .",
    "then , the hamiltonian @xmath200 generating evolution along @xmath69 is given by : [ ham ] h_t & = & _ m constraints+ _ r_o _ s_r_o ( _ 2 ) ^2 + & + & _ s _ ( _ 2 ) ^2 + ( l ) _",
    "+ where @xmath201 are large 2-spheres of radius @xmath202 .",
    "( the calculation and the final result are completely analogous to those in the einstein - maxwell case @xcite .",
    "the only differences are : i ) since we have set the cosmological constant equal to zero , the scalar curvature of the 4-metric vanishes on @xmath10 , and ii ) the surface term that results from integration by parts of the maxwell gauss constraint now contains @xmath203 in place of @xmath204 . )",
    "note that the surface terms depend only on the ` coulombic ' parts of the gravitational and maxwell fields .",
    "the form of their integrands is rather similar since asymptotically the newman - penrose spin - coefficient @xmath127 goes as @xmath205 .",
    "however , while the surface term at infinity depends _ only _ of the weyl curvature , the term at the horizon depends also on the maxwell potential .",
    "it is easy to check that the surface term at infinity is , as usual , the time component @xmath206 of the adm 4-momentum @xmath207 , which in the present -,+,+,+ signature is negative of the adm energy , @xmath208 .",
    "it is natural to identify the surface term at @xmath198 as the energy of the isolated horizon .",
    "( there is no minus sign because @xmath198 is the _ inner _ boundary of @xmath5 ) .",
    "since @xmath209 and since @xmath103 represents the ` rest frame ' of the isolated horizon , this energy can in turn be identified with the horizon mass @xmath16 .",
    "thus , we have : [ mass ] m_= _ s _ ( _ 2 ) ^2 + ( l ) _ . using the expression ( [ 4.13 ] ) of surface gravity in terms of the weyl tensor and the expression ( [ phi ] ) of @xmath210 on @xmath10",
    ", we can cast @xmath16 in a more familiar form : [ smarr ] m_= a _ + _ thus , as in the ggm solutions , we obtain the smarr formula .",
    "however , the meaning of various symbols in the equation is somewhat different .",
    "since an isolated horizon need not be a killing horizon , in general @xmath16 does equal the adm mass , nor is @xmath13 or @xmath18 computed using a killing field .",
    "if the space - time happens to be static with @xmath69 as the killing field , general arguments from symplectic geometry can be used to show that the numerical value of the hamiltonian @xmath200 vanishes at this solution @xcite . since the constraints are satisfied in any solution , the bulk term in ( [ ham ] ) vanishes as well .",
    "hence , in this case , @xmath211 . in general",
    ", however , the two differ by the ` radiative energy ' in the space - time . in the einstein - maxwell case",
    ", one can argue @xcite that , if @xmath10 stretches all the way to @xmath212 , under suitable regularity conditions @xmath16 equals the future limit of the bondi - energy in the frame in which the black hole is at rest .",
    "there appears to be no obstruction to extending that argument to the dilatonic case . finally ,",
    "as emphasized in @xcite , the matter contribution to the mass formula ( [ mass ] ) is subtle : while it does not include the energy in radiation outside the horizon , it does include the energy in the ` coulombic part ' of the field associated with the black hole hair .",
    "( recall that the future limit of the bondi energy has this property . )",
    "however , since this issue was discussed in detail in @xcite , and since dilaton couplings do not add substantive complications , we will not repeat that discussion it here .",
    "we now have expressions of the mass @xmath16 , surface gravity @xmath13 , area @xmath9 and the electric potential @xmath18 of any isolated horizon in terms of the convenient functions @xmath213 of its fundamental parameters @xmath214 : [ functions1 ] m_=(1 + ( 1-^2 ) ) & ; & a_=4r_^2 ( 1- ( 1+^2 ) ) ^2 ^ 2/(1+^2 ) + = ( 1- ( 1+^2 ) ) & ; & = e^2k _ . since all quantities are now expressed in a closed form in terms of the same parameters of isolated horizons , it is easy to compute their variations . a simple calculation yields [ 1law2 ] & = & + + _ k _ + & = & + where @xmath215 ( i.e. , @xmath216/r^2_\\delta$ ] ) and @xmath217 . thus , as one might have expected from the einstein - maxwell analysis of @xcite , the first law ( [ ggm1law ] ) for general isolated horizons has the same form as ( [ ggm1law ] ) , the first law in ggm solutions .",
    "the only difference in the detailed expression is the replacement of the adm mass @xmath5 by the horizon mass @xmath16 .",
    "however , physically , this difference is important @xcite .",
    "consider , for example , a space - time which admits an isolated horizon @xmath218 for a finite time interval which ceases to be isolated for a small duration because of the influx of radiation into the horizon and settles down again to an isolated horizon @xmath219 .",
    "then , using two ` triangular ' regions @xmath220 and @xmath221 in the space - time with internal boundaries @xmath218 and @xmath219 respectively ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , one can compute the masses @xmath222 and @xmath223 of the two isolated horizons . while the adm mass @xmath5 of the space - time remains unchanged during this physical process , the isolated horizon mass does change ; @xmath224 . by using the raychaudhuri equation , one can show that the the difference is precisely the mass associated with the radiation which fell in .",
    "thus , in this process the mass contained in the radiation outside the horizon decreases , the horizon mass increases but the sum , which equals the adm mass @xmath5 , remains unchanged . if there is flux of charged matter across the horizon , the situation is more subtle but the final result is the same . as discussed in detail in @xcite , in this case , there does not appear to exist a treatment of the physical process version of the first law without recourse to the isolated horizon framework .",
    "finally , note that the expression ( [ smarr ] ) of @xmath16 can be trivially rewritten in terms of the hatted variables : m_= a _",
    "+ _ thus , for dilatonic isolated horizons , the smarr formula and the first law have the same form as in the einstein - maxwell case , the only difference being that the electric potential and charge are now replaced by @xmath225 and @xmath226 .",
    "we will conclude this discussion with three remarks : a ) the space @xmath1 of space - times admitting isolated horizons is infinite dimensional .",
    "fortunately , however , the boundary conditions are sufficiently strong to enable us to express physical parameters such as the mass @xmath16 and the surface gravity @xmath13 in terms of only three parameters ; they are lifts to @xmath1 of functions on @xmath183 .",
    "explicit calculations presented in this section made a heavy use of the new coordinates @xmath227 on @xmath183 .",
    "however , from a conceptual standpoint , the introduction of these coordinates is not essential . for , @xmath16 , @xmath13 , @xmath9 and @xmath18 are all well - defined functions on @xmath183 and the first law is a statement of relations between the gradients of three of these functions .",
    "it makes no reference at all to the choice of coordinates on @xmath183 . indeed , in principle ,",
    "we could have used only the fundamental parameters @xmath184 throughout ; passage to @xmath186 served to simplify the algebra .",
    "\\b ) the new parameterization entered our explicit calculations because we wished to reduce the rescaling freedom in @xmath101 in such a way that in the static ( ggm ) solutions @xmath101 coincides with the restriction to @xmath10 of that static killing field which is unit at infinity . to implement this condition , we had to ask that , on general isolated horizons , @xmath127 be the same function of parameters as @xmath181 is in static solutions and @xmath181 could not be expressed in a closed form in terms of @xmath184 .",
    "while this choice of scale for @xmath101 is most convenient for making contact with the standard static framework , we could have made other choices . in general ,",
    "if we rescale @xmath101 via @xmath228 , where @xmath158 is a constant on @xmath10 ( but may be a function of the parameters ) , we have @xmath229 , @xmath230 , @xmath231 and @xmath232 while the area @xmath9 and the charge @xmath203 remain unchanged ( see eq ( [ mass ] ) and the discussion in section [ s4 ] ) .",
    "let us choose @xmath233 .",
    "then we have [ functions2 ] m_^=(1 + ( 1-^2 ) ) & ; & a_^=4r_^2 + ^= ( 1- ( 1+^2 ) ) & ; & ^= , where , as before , @xmath234 = \\q_\\delta\\ , e^{2\\alpha\\phi_\\delta}$ ] and @xmath235 $ ] .",
    "thus , in this rescaling gauge , all physical quantities are expressed entirely in terms of the fundamental parameters @xmath194 . in this gauge",
    "the first law becomes : [ 1law3 ] = ^ a_^+ ( 1-^2 ) q^ _ , where @xmath236 .",
    "note that eqs ( [ functions2 ] ) and ( [ 1law3 ] ) are completely equivalent to eqs ( [ functions1 ] ) and ( [ 1law2 ] ) ; the two sets express the same information but in different rescaling - gauges .",
    "one set is adapted to the fundamental parameters of isolated horizons but fails to reduce to the standard set of expressions used in the static context .",
    "the other set does reproduce the standard expressions in the static case but involves the use of auxiliary parameters @xmath237 .",
    "\\c ) our main results can be immediately generalized to incorporate a cosmological constant @xmath238 .",
    "the only essential change in section [ s3 ] is that the scalar curvature @xmath62 of the 4-metric at the horizon is now given by @xmath239 , which in turn introduces factors of @xmath238 in the expressions of physical quantities in sections [ s4 ] and [ s5 ] ( see @xcite ) .",
    "now , it is known that there are no static black hole solutions in presence of a positive cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "therefore , if isolated horizons exist with @xmath240 , we would not be able to fix the normalization of @xmath101 using the procedure used in section [ s4 ] .",
    "however , as the discussion of sections [ s4 ] and [ s5 ] and the discussion in the point b ) above shows , one could still establish the zeroth and first laws . for @xmath241 ,",
    "static solutions are known to exist @xcite and we can repeat the procedure given above . then , one can show = ( 1-(1+^2 ) e^2k_- ) the electrostatic potential @xmath18 is unaffected and the smarr formula ( [ smarr ] ) and the first law continues to hold .",
    "in @xcite , the zeroth and first laws were established for mechanics of non - rotating isolated horizons in general relativity .",
    "while the restrictions on the matter content were rather mild , that analysis did not allow a dilatonic charge or dilaton couplings . in this note",
    ", we extended that analysis to dilaton gravity .",
    "key ideas and strategies are the same as those introduced in @xcite . however , the incorporation of general dilaton couplings i.e . , arbitrary values of the coupling parameter @xmath2 was not entirely straightforward because the specific gauge choices needed to define surface gravity and electro - magnetic potential on general isolated horizons are now rather complicated .",
    "however , once an appropriate viewpoint towards parameterization of general isolated horizons is introduced , one realizes that the complications are rather tame ; only the algebra becomes more involved . in the final picture ,",
    "the proof of the zeroth law is completely analogous to that in the einstein - maxwell case and the first law has exactly the same form as in static ggm solutions .",
    "there are three natural directions in which the results of this paper could be extended .",
    "first , as in the previous work @xcite , our boundary conditions imply that the intrinsic 2-metric on @xmath10 is spherically symmetric ( although the space - time metric need not admit _ any _ killing field in a neighborhood of @xmath10 . )",
    "it is of interest to extend the analysis to incorporate ( non - rotating but ) distorted isolated horizons .",
    "this would only require weakening of the boundary condition ( iii.b ) on derivatives of @xmath128 and ( iv ) on spherical symmetry of @xmath129 .",
    "a second and more interesting extension would be inclusion of rotation .",
    "again , only conditions ( iii.b ) and ( iv ) would have to be weakened . very recently , both these extensions were carried out for the einstein - maxwell theory @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to the present paper , these analyses do not fix the scaling of @xmath103 using static solutions ; a more general strategy is involved .",
    "therefore , it is likely that those considerations will extend to dilaton couplings as well , even though explicit distorted or rotating dilatonic solutions are still not known . finally , as pointed out at the end of section [ s3 ] , isolated horizons provide a natural home to study black holes with non - standard asymptotic structure . for theories considered in @xcite",
    ", the present analysis already suffices to establish the zeroth law , i.e. , the constancy of @xmath13 on the horizon .",
    "it would be interesting to analyze whether the methods developed in @xcite can be used to establish the first law .",
    "we would like to thank chris beetle , steve fairhurst and jerzy lewandowski for discussions , hernando quevedo for checking certain properties of the gibbons - maeda solutions using reduce , and gary gibbons and a referee for pointing out references @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
