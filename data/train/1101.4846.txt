    "it is commonly accepted that plasmoids play a very important role in the magnetic field reconnection in solar flares .",
    "their importance , for the first time , was recognized by @xcite . in the 1992 october  5 flare , observed in soft x - rays by _ yohkoh _ satellite , they analyzed the plasmoid which was ejected during the impulsive phase upwards into the corona .",
    "studying the same flare , @xcite showed that this plasmoid ejection was associated with the drifting pulsating structure ( dps ) on radiowaves .",
    "they proposed the model of this radio emission , which was further developed in the papers by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in this model , in the current sheet , due to tearing and coalescence processes the plasmoids are formed . as shown by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite during these processes electrons",
    "are very efficiently accelerated .",
    "the electrons are then trapped in plasmoids , where they generate langmuir waves , which through a wave transformation produce the electromagnetic waves recorded on the radio spectrum as dpss . due to limited range of plasma densities in the plasmoid the dps",
    "is generated in the limited range of frequencies . in the vertical current sheet",
    "the plasmoids move upwards or downwards or even stay without any motion in dependance on a form of the surrounding magnetic field @xcite . due to a preference of divergent magnetic field lines in the upward direction ,",
    "most of the plasmoids move upwards and corresponding dpss drift towards lower frequencies . nevertheless , in some cases",
    "the plasmoids move downwards and even interact with the underlying flare arcade as observed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the electron acceleration by multi - island coalescence processes in pic model with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "they found that the most effective acceleration process is during the coalescence of plasmoids ( `` anti - reconnection '' ) , see also @xcite and @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite proposed that the current sheet , stretched by a rising magnetic rope , is fragmented to smaller and smaller plasmoids by the tearing mode instability in subsequently narrower and narrower current sheets ( cascading reconnection ) .",
    "this suggestion has been recently further theoretically developed by @xcite and @xcite into the theory of chain plasmoid instability .",
    "an advantage of this concept is that it explains how very narrow current sheets with high current densities ( requested for the anomalous resistivity generation and fast reconnection ) are generated . moreover , many x - points in this model give sufficient volume for an acceleration of particles .",
    "besides this fragmentation described by @xcite , @xcite found a new fragmentation in the region between two merging plasmoids using mhd simulations .",
    "this fragmentation is caused by the tearing mode instability in the current sheet generated between these interacting plasmoids and this process is repeated in smaller and smaller spatial scales .",
    "this fragmentation is driven by a merging process of the plasmoids .",
    "considering all the above - mentioned processes , in the present paper , we focus our attention to two processes : ( a ) successive merging of plasmoids to large plasmoid and ( b ) fragmentation process between merging plasmoids .",
    "we selected these processes because we think that the successive merging of plasmoids can explain the above - the - loop - top hard x - ray source ( as a large stationary plasmoid ) . on the other hand",
    ", the fragmentation can explain the narrowband dm - spikes . because both these phenomena are generated by accelerated electrons , in following simulations we use the particle - in - cell ( pic ) model instead of mhd models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the above - the - loop - top hard x - ray sources belong to the most discussed topics in recent years .",
    "the well - known example of such a hard x - ray source is that observed in the @xmath33050 kev energy range by @xcite .",
    "however , such events are very rare @xcite .",
    "another very interesting example was published just recently by @xcite .",
    "they presented the hard x - ray source ( with the energy up to @xmath380 kev ) which was located 6 mm above thermal flare loops .",
    "they derived the upper limit of the plasma density and source volume as n@xmath4 8@xmath510@xmath0 @xmath2 and @xmath6 8@xmath5 10@xmath7 @xmath8 , respectively . just a relatively low plasma density in such hard x - ray sources",
    "attracts attention of scientists .",
    "@xcite concluded that these hard x - ray sources have to be close to the acceleration region and the distribution function of electrons emitting hard x - rays is strongly non - thermal or the plasma in the source is very hot ( up to t@xmath9 @xmath3 200 mk ) .",
    "several ideas explaining these x - ray sources have been proposed , e.g. the magnetic or turbulent trapping , and dense ( collisionally thick ) coronal sources ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )    the narrowband dm - spikes ( further spikes ) belong to the most interesting radio bursts due to exceptionally high brightness temperatures ( t@xmath10  @xmath11  10@xmath12  k ) and short durations ( @xmath13  0.1  s , see the review by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "their observational characteristics were described in many papers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "on the other hand , the theoretical models can be divided into two groups : a )  based on the plasma emission and acceleration processes @xcite , and b )  based on the electron - cyclotron maser @xcite . to distinguish between these two types of models polarization and harmonic structures of the spikes",
    "have been also studied @xcite .",
    "searching for a  characteristic bandwidth of individual spikes @xcite found that the fourier transform of the dynamic spectra of spikes have a  power - law form with power - law indices close to  @xmath14 .",
    "based on these results @xcite proposed that the spikes are generated in turbulent reconnection outflows .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : first , we present our model scenario and explain the successive merging and fragmentation process . then using a 2.5-d pic model we simulate these processes .",
    "the results are then used in the interpretation of the above - the - loop - top hard x - ray sources and narrowband dm - spikes .",
    "fig .  [ figure1 ] shows our model scenario , which is based on the standard cshkp flare model ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . in the central part of the current sheet , in agreement with @xcite , we assume a fragmentation of the current sheet ( stretching - tearing fragmentation ) . furthermore , based on the new results of @xcite , we propose that the reconnection plasma outflow ( which is downward oriented ) accumulates plasmoids in the region just above the flare arcade , where thus plasmoids can interact efficiently .",
    "we think that in some cases a large plasmoid can be formed here as a result of successive merging of plasmoids . on the other hand , between",
    "the merging plasmoids new current sheets are formed and in these current sheets one again further ( but on smaller and smaller spatial scales ) plasmoids are generated ( fragmentation between merging plasmoids ) . while the first process of the successive merging we propose for the interpretation of the above - the - loop - top hard x - ray sources , the second process is a very promising process explaining the narrowband dm - spikes ( see the following sections [ sect31 ] and [ sect32 ] ) .    for simulation we used a 2.5-d ( 2d3v  2 spatial and 3 velocity components ) fully relativistic electromagnetic particle - in - cell model @xcite .",

    "the figure shows that the initial current sheet is fragmented into several sub - current sheets . in these secondary current sheets",
    "further tearing can exist provided they are sufficiently long .",

    "[ figure6 ] is @xmath39 ) . at this scale ,",
    "however no further fragmentation has been observed , the current structures dissipate by plasma kinetic processes silently.    considering the structures of fragmented current sheets ( cascade of plasmoids ) obtained by numerical simulations ( fig .  [ figure6 ] ) , we constructed the schematic structure of fragmentation .",
    "an example of such a structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] .",
    "the circles mean plasmoids with positively ( @xmath40 ) and negatively ( @xmath41 ) oriented electric currents , the parallel lines mean boundaries of current sheets .",

    "the power - law dependence were found also in the analysis of the frequency bandwidth of the narrowband dm - spikes @xcite .",
    "therefore , considering this fact , the model scenario shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] , and the turbulent - plasma model of spikes by @xcite , we propose that the narrowband dm - spikes are generated in fragmentation processes between merging plasmoids in the reconnection outflow in the region above the flare loop arcade . while @xcite supposed ( silently ) mhd / alfvnic turbulence in the super - sonic outflows ,",
    "our recent simulations indicate that the tearing / coalescence cascade might be more likely source of turbulence .",

    "they can generate the radio emission in the frequency range corresponding to the range of the plasma density in this plasmoid .",
    "due to expected power - law dependence of spatial scales of these fragmented plasmoids , the dependence of bandwidths of the resulting radio emission should be the power - law one as observed in the narrowband dm - spikes .",
    "the reddish areas mean the electric current densities with the initial orientation of the electric current , and the blue ones mean those with the opposite orientation ; red and green lines are positions of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively ; their intersections represent the x- and o- type null points.,width=302 ]    to support this idea , in fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] we present the radio spectrum observed during the 28 march 2001 flare by two ondejov radiospectrographs ( 0.82.0 and 2.04.5 ghz ) @xcite .",
    "it shows two positively drifting pulsating structures ( dpss ) which according to our previous studies indicate two plasmoids moving downwards to the sources of the narrowband dm - spikes ( generated in the region of fragmentation , compare to the model scenario in fig .",

    "the plus and minus signs express orientation of electric currents in the plasmoids . @xmath60 and @xmath61 are in arbitrary units.,width=226 ]",
    "important aspect of our model is that we used free boundary conditions which enabled successive merging of small plasmoids into a large final plasmoid . in simulations",
    ", we recognized also a fragmentation of current sheet between two merging plasmoids .",
    "we showed that these processes very efficiently accelerate electrons to energies relevant for the emission in the hard x - ray range .",
    "based on this result we propose that the above - the - loop - top hard x - ray sources are produced by the successive merging of plasmoids in the region with the turbulent reconnection outflow , in the region just above the loop arcade . computed x - ray spectra support this idea .",
    "to explain a difference between the slopes of the computed and observed x - ray spectra we propose that the observed power - law spectrum is a sum of emissions from many locations with different thermal and nonthermal distribution functions .    in simulations we used the particle - in - cell model . although , the studied processes are self - similar ( i.e. they does not depend on scales , see e.g. the mhd and pic simulations in the paper by @xcite ) , the results need to be taken with a caution , because the spatial and time scales in the model and real plasmoids differ in several orders of magnitude . on the other hand , it is beyond a possibility of any present numerical model to take into account all these scales .",
    "further aspect of the pic modelling is that the coulomb collisions were not considered in our model .",
    "namely , the time interval of our computations is much shorter than the collision time in the - above - the - loop - top x - ray sources ; e.g. @xmath32 = 7800 for the plasma density n@xmath9 = 10@xmath62 @xmath2 corresponds to 4.5 @xmath5 10@xmath63 s and the collision time to 0.115 t@xmath64 s , where t@xmath65 = t@xmath9/10@xmath66 . on the other hand ,",
    "the coulomb collisions are essential for the bremsstrahlung x - ray emission .",
    "the hard x - ray spectra in the december 31 , 2007 flare were detected as the mean ones over intervals of several seconds . furthermore , the - above - the - loop - top hard x - ray source lasted of about 2 minutes . thus comparing these times with the collision one , the collisions influence not only the observed spectra , but also a duration of the x - ray source",
    ". therefore some re - acceleration of electrons is even needed . in the present model",
    "such a re - acceleration is very probable , because the plasmoids are generated in a broad range of spatial scales and electrons can travel several times though regions of interacting plasmoids .",
    "although an inclusion of the coulomb collisions and corresponding prolongation of computations are beyond the possibility of our present pic modelling , we think that the observed spectra are given by a competition of the collisions with the re - acceleration of electrons . on the other hand , in pic model",
    "the anomalous collisions ( wave - particle interactions ) , which are much more effective than the coulomb collisions , are present as confirmed by fast thermalization of nonthermal distribution functions .",
    "we made additional computations with different initial parameters and we found : a ) the energy gain of accelerated electrons increases with the decrease of the plasma beta parameter , and b ) the increase of the proton - electron mass ratio m@xmath67/m@xmath9 makes computations longer , but results are similar .",
    "we compared the present simulation also with that in the numerical model which size was two times smaller ( @xmath15 = 600@xmath16 @xmath5 2000@xmath16 ) and in which only 5 plasmoids were initiated ( contrary to 10 plasmoids in the present simulation ) . in this case",
    "the final mean energy of accelerated electrons was 5.3 times greater than the initial one , compare with that of 10.7 times ( from the initial temperature 10  mk to final temperature 107  mk ) in the present case .",
    "namely , each coalescence process increases the energy of accelerated electrons , therefore the number of successive coalescence processes is essential for their final energy .    for calculations of the hard x - ray spectra , presented in fig .",
    "[ figure5]b we used two methods",
    ". the obtained results are similar .",
    "small differences are due to differences in these methods and deviations of the computed distribution functions from the thermal one .",
    "the plasmoids in 2-d are in reality 3-d magnetic ropes . while in 2-d",
    "the trapping of energetic electrons is a natural consequence of a close magnetic field structure of the plasmoid , in 3-d , this structure is only semi - closed .",
    "however , we consider the merging processes in the turbulent reconnection outflow therefore the magnetic trapping of electrons , similar to that proposed by @xcite is highly probable .",
    "moreover , the coalescence fragmentation process , which generates the reverse electric currents ( which in 3-d has to be closed in finite volume ) will contribute to a full trapping of electrons .    in agreement with the conclusions by @xcite , in the model",
    "the acceleration region is very close to the hard x - ray source .",
    "it enables to re - accelerate energetic electrons , which loss their energy due to collisions .",
    "acceleration regions are among interacting plasmoids and also between the plasmoids and the arcade of flaring loops .",
    "this model can explain not only the above - the - loop - top hard x - ray sources , but also the loop - top sources because the arcade of loops is , in principle , the plasmoid fixed in its half height at the photosphere .",
    "considering all aspects of the fragmentation process ( power - law spatial scales of plasmoids , effective acceleration of electrons , trapping of electrons in plasmoids , location in the reconnection plasma outflow ) we think that this process can explain a generation of the narrowband dm - spikes .",
    "we supported this idea by the radio spectrum observed during the 28 march 2001 showing dpss drifting towards the narrowband dm - spikes .",
    "furthermore , it is known that more than 70  @xmath68 of all groups of dm - spikes are observed during the goes - rising - flare phases @xcite .",
    "although these arguments support the presented idea , further analysis of the narrowband dm - spikes and their modelling is necessary .",
    "the presented model is a natural extension of our previous models explaining the plasmoid formation , its ejection , and corresponding dps .",
    "the question arises why the above - the - loop - top hard x - ray sources are very rare comparing , e.g. , with dpss or dm - spikes observations .",
    "we think that the above - the - loop - top hard x - ray source is large and stationary plasmoid , which is sufficiently dense and in which there is sufficient amount of energetic electrons .",
    "positional stationarity and location of this plasmoid is given by surrounding magnetic field and location where this plasmoid starts to be formed , see the paper by @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the plasmoids generating dpss or dm - spikes need not to be so dense and they need not to have such amount of energetic electrons .",
    "it is known that for generation of the radio emission a number of energetic electrons can be much smaller than that for the hard x - ray emission .",
    "namely , the intensity of the radio emission depends on derivatives of the electron distribution function in the momentum space ; not on the absolute amount of energetic electrons as in the case of the hard x - ray emission .",
