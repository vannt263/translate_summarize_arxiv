    "astrophysical observations indicate that nearly seventy percent of the cosmic energy density is hidden in some unknown ` dark ' sector commonly called as ` dark energy ' ( de ) @xcite .",
    "the remaining contribution to the total energy density is contained in dark matter and meager baryonic matter @xcite .",
    "dark energy is described phenomenologically by an equation of state ( eos ) @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the pressure and energy density of dark energy , while @xmath8 is an eos parameter which effectively describes cosmic acceleration . to describe de",
    ", one must have @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "* general relativity ( gr ) offers only one solution to this puzzle * , , namely ` cosmological constant ' which suffers from fine tuning and coincidence problems .",
    "since gr fails to explain the cosmic accelerated expansion , one needs to modify curvature or the matter part in the einstein field equations .",
    "some notable examples are @xmath11 gravity @xcite , scalar - tensor gravity @xcite and lovelock gravity @xcite and more recently @xmath0 gravity @xcite , to name a few .",
    "other models where matter action is modified include the bulk viscous stress @xcite and the anisotropic stress @xcite or some exotic fluid like chaplygin gas ( cg ) @xcite .",
    "* one of the crucial tests to check the viability of extended theories of gravity is the potential detection of gravitational waves @xcite . *",
    "we assume a phenomenological form of interaction between matter and dark energy since these are the dominant components of the cosmic composition , following @xcite .",
    "the exact nature of this interaction is beyond the scope of the paper and unresolved till we obtain a consistent theory of quantum gravity . in these interacting dark energy - dark matter models",
    ", the dark energy decays into matter at a rate proportional to hubble length .",
    "* the interacting dark energy scenario can successfully resolve the coincidence problem then stable attractor solutions of the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) equations can be obtained @xcite.some observational support to these models come from the astrophysical observations @xcite . * * for motivation from field theory and particle physics of the interacting dark energy , the interested reader is referred to @xcite . *",
    "the present paper is devoted to the study of dynamics of interacting dark energy in @xmath0 cosmology .",
    "this theory is based on torsion scalar @xmath12 rather than curvature scalar @xmath13 .",
    "we assume the dark energy in the form of a perfect fluid interacting with the matter . *",
    "we study this model by the local stability method and than extend it for dark energy satisfying a more general form of equation of state . *",
    "general relativity is a gauge theory of the gravitational field .",
    "it is based on the equivalence principle .",
    "* however it is not necessary to work with riemannian manifolds . *",
    "* there are some extended theories such as riemann - cartan , in them the geometrical structure of the theory has non - vanishing object of non - metricity . * in these extensions , there are more than one dynamical quantity ( metric ) . for example",

    ", we can leave the riemannian manifold and go to weitznbock spacetime , with torsion and zero local riemann tensor .",
    "* one sample of such theories is called teleparallel gravity in which we are working in a non - riemannian manifold.*the dynamics of the metric is determined using the scalar torsion @xmath12 . * * the fundamental quantities in teleparallel theory are the vierbein ( tetrad ) basis vectors @xmath14 . * this basis is an orthogonal , coordinate free basis , defined by the following equation @xmath15 this tetrad basis must be orthonormal and @xmath16 is the minkowski metric .",
    "it means that @xmath17 .",
    "* there is a simple extension of the teleparallel gravity , which is called @xmath0 gravity . * in this theories , f is an arbitrary function of the torsion @xmath12 .",

    "the theory has been found to address the issue of cosmic acceleration in the early and late evolution of universe @xcite but this crucially depends on the choice of suitable @xmath0 , * for instance exponential form containing @xmath12 can not lead to phantom crossing @xcite*. reconstruction of @xmath0 models has been reported in @xcite * while thermodynamics of @xmath0 cosmology including the generalized second law of thermodynamics has been recently investigated @xcite . *      we adopt the metric in the form of a flat friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker metric with metric @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",

    "teleparallel gravities , phase space analysis for different dark energy models has been reported in @xcite . *",
    "in this section , we treat dark energy as a perfect fluid . physically it means that the fluid has no viscosity or heat transfer property .",
    "its a simple fluid which can not be self - gravitating and has a smooth distribution in space . a perfect fluid",
    "is represented by a phenomenological linear equation of state connecting energy density and pressure by @xmath56 where @xmath8 is a ` constant ' of proportionality but can be a function of time or e - folding parameter @xmath57 . for a general dark energy paradigm ,",
    "the minimum condition to be satisfied is @xmath58 .",

    "thus we must choose @xmath0 to solve the system .",
    "it is discussed in @xcite that a power - law form of correction term @xmath64 @xmath65 such as @xmath66 can remove the finite - time future singularity . however , when @xmath67 , the correction term behaves like a cosmological constant .",
    "* the model with @xmath68 can be helpful in realizing power - law inflation , and also describes little - rip and pseudo - rip cosmology @xcite . * due to these reasons , we choose @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a constant . *",
    "note that choosing @xmath71 ( or @xmath30 ) leads to teleparallel gravity which is equivalent to general relativity .",
    "note that this choice @xmath72 has correspondence with the cosmological constant eos in @xmath0 gravity @xcite .",
    "this @xmath0 model can be recovered via reconstruction scheme of holographic dark energy @xcite .",
    "also it can be inspired from a model for dark energy model form the veneziano ghost @xcite .",
    "recently capozziello et al @xcite investigated the cosmography of @xmath0 cosmology by using data of bao , supernovae ia and wmap .",
    "following their interesting results , we notice that if we choose @xmath73 , than one can estimate the parameters of this @xmath0 model as a function of hubble parameter @xmath74 and the cosmographic parameters and the value of matter density parameter .",
    "*    recently attractor solutions for the dynamical system with three fluids ( dark matter , dark energy and radiation ) interacting non - gravitationally have been investigated to resolve the coincidence problem using similar @xmath0 @xcite .    to perform the stability of the system comprising equations ( [ sys1 ] ) and ( [ sys2 ] ) , we first calculate the critical points ( @xmath75 ) by equating @xmath76 we find two critical points a and b for system ( [ sys1 ] ) and ( [ sys2 ] ) given in table - i .",

    "is said to be _ stable _ if the corresponding eigenvalues are negative @xmath85 for all the values of the model parameters .",
    "such stable critical points are called attractor solutions of the dynamical system * i.e. solution of the dynamical system for different initial conditions which converge to a stable critical point . * a critical point",
    "is said to be _ unstable _ if both the eigenvalues are positive , * and a _ saddle point _ if one of the eigenvalues is positive .",
    "* we are interested only in stable critical points .",
    "sometimes we get _ conditionally stable _ critical points i.e. the critical point which can be stable only under some conditions on the model parameters . in cosmology",
    "conditionally stable points are also of interest . in table-[table : parameters ] , we write down the values of relevant cosmological parameters including the total equation of state and the deceleration parameter . note that for @xmath86 , we have @xmath87 , therefore @xmath88 . for a , @xmath89",

    "* this is a new constraint on the coupling constant @xmath100 from the phase analysis approach .",

    "we remember here that , this discussion is free from any specific form of the @xmath0 .",
    "we conclude that for interacting dark energy models in @xmath0 gravity , there is only one physically acceptable critical point d.",
    "* in this paper , we investigated the stability and phase space description of a perfect fluid form of the dark energy interacting with matter . *",
    "we wrote the general dynamical system equations for two fluids and found the critical points .",
    "* we linearized the system of equations and showed that for perfect fluid case there is only one attractor solution . * for any value of the eos parameter @xmath8 , we obtained a new bound on the coupling constant @xmath102 .",
    "it is a new constraint on @xmath100 in the context of the @xmath0 gravity which shows that energy is being transferred from matter to dark energy .",
    "thus we obtain a scenario where the universe becomes increasingly dark energy dominated .",
