    "the study of arguments as abstract entities and their interaction as introduced by dung  @xcite has become one of the most active research branches within artificial intelligence and reasoning , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "argumentation handles possible conflicts between arguments in form of attacks .",
    "the arguments may either originate from a dialogue between several agents or from the pieces of information at the disposal of a single agent , this information may even contain contradictions .",
    "a main issue for any argumentation system is the selection of acceptable sets of arguments , where an acceptable set of arguments must be in some sense coherent and be able to defend itself against all attacking arguments .",
    "abstract argumentation provides suitable concepts and formalisms to study , represent , and process various reasoning problems most prominently in defeasible reasoning ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) and agent interaction ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    extending dung s concept ,",
    "bench - capon  @xcite introduced _ value - based argumentation _",
    "systems that allow to compare arguments with respect to their relative strength such that an argument can not successfully attack another argument that is considered of a higher rank .",
    "the ranking is specified by the combination of an assignment of _ values _ to arguments and an ordering of the values ; the latter is called an _ audience _  @xcite . as laid out by bench - capon ,",
    "the role of arguments in this setting is to persuade rather than to prove , demonstrate or refute .",
    "whether an argument can be accepted with respect to _ all possible _ or _ at least one _ audience allows to formalize the notions of _ objective acceptance _ and _ subjective acceptance _",
    ", respectively .",
    "an important limitation for using value - based argumentation systems in real - world applications is the _ computational intractability _ of the two basic acceptance problems : deciding whether a given argument is subjectively accepted is @xmath0-hard , deciding whether it is objectively accepted is @xmath1-hard @xcite .",
    "therefore it is important to identify classes of value - based systems that are still useful and expressible but allow a polynomial - time tractable acceptance decision .",
    "however , no non - trivial tractable classes of value - based systems have been identified so far , except for systems with a tree structure where the degree of nodes and the number of nodes of degree exceeding  2 are bounded  @xcite .",
    "in fact , as pointed out by dunne  @xcite , the acceptance problems remain intractable for value - based systems whose graphical structures form trees , in strong contrast to the main computational problems for non - value - based argumentation that are linear - time tractable for tree systems , or more generally , for systems of bounded treewidth  @xcite .",
    "[ [ our - contribution ] ] our contribution + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in this paper we introduce nontrivial classes of value - based systems for which the acceptance problems are tractable . the classes are defined in terms of the following notions :    * the _ value - width _ of a value - based system is the largest number of arguments of the same value . * the _ extended graph structure _ of a value - based system has as nodes the arguments of the value - based system , two arguments are joined by an edge if either one attacks the other or both share the same value . * the _ value graph _ of a value - based system has as vertices the values of the system , two values @xmath2 and @xmath3 are joined by a directed edge if some argument of value @xmath2 attacks an argument of value @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "we show that the acceptance problems are tractable for the following classes of value - based systems :    * value - based systems with a bipartite graph structure where at most two arguments share the same value ( i.e. , systems of value - width  2 ) ; * value - based systems whose extended graph structure has bounded treewidth ; and * value - based systems of bounded value - width whose value graphs have bounded treewidth .    in fact , we show that both acceptance problems are _ linear time tractable _ for the classes ( p2 ) and  ( p3 ) , the latter being a subclass of the former .",
    "our results suggest that the extended graph structure is a suitable structural representation of value - based argumentation systems .",
    "the positive results ( p1)(p3 ) hold for systems with unbounded number of arguments , attacks and values .",
    "we contrast our positive results with negative results that rule out classes conjectured to be tractable .",
    "we show that the acceptance problems are ( co)-np - hard for the following classes :    * value - based systems of value - width 2 ; * value - based systems where the number of attacks between arguments of the same value is bounded ( systems of _ bounded attack - width _ ) ; * value - based systems with bipartite value graphs .",
    "in fact , we show that both acceptance problems are intractable for value - based systems of value - width 2 and attack - width  1 . classes ( n1 ) and ( n2 ) were conjectured to be tractable  @xcite , the complexity of ( n3 ) was stated as an open problem  @xcite .",
    "the reminder of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : pre ] we provide basic definitions and preliminaries . in section  [ sec : valuewidth ] we define the parameters value - width and attack - width and establish the results involving systems of value - width  2 , we also discuss the relationship between systems of value - width 2 and dialogues  @xcite . in section  [ sec : tw ] we consider value - based systems with an extended graph structure of bounded treewidth and show linear time tractability .",
