    "unfortunately , in the majority of published papers devoted to silicon refractive index measuring , the crystals used for this purpose are characterized neither in purity , nor in conductivity , both influencing the measurement results .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of measuring the room - temperature transmission spectra in the short - wavelength edge and phonon absorption regions , the raman spectra excited by the 514.5  nm ar laser line and the refractive index spectral dependence in the , , and far - ir spectral ranges in silicon single crystals with natural isotopic composition , @xmath3 , and silicon isotopes @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 with the basic isotope content above 99.9  at.% prepared by the same technology .",
