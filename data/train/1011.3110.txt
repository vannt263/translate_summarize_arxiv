    "the formation of structures at the nanoscale has attracted a lot of attention .",
    "the morphological and statistical properties of these systems are governed by microscopic processes like adsorption and desorption , fragmentation , diffusion and aggregation , etc .",
    "different non - equilibrium steady - states can be accessed and phase transitions induced if the rates of the these processes are varied .",
    "several experimental and theoretical studies have focused on adatom and cluster diffusion @xcite . however , there are relatively few studies which consider the fragmentation of clusters , expected to commonly occur during hyperthermal ion beam depositions and sputter depositions @xcite .",
    "the bombardment of clusters by energetic ions induces _ large island boundary fluctuations _ which cause multiple - chipping events @xcite .",
    "these systems have received limited attention to date because of the unavailability of experimental probes to observe fragmentation .",
    "further , the occurrence of these events is often on a pico - second time scale , making collection of data difficult .",
    "the processes of fragmentation and aggregation significantly affect the growth mechanism by altering the number of small and large clusters .",
    "the steady - state cluster - size distribution in these systems is generally characterized by an exponentially decaying tail @xcite .",
    "in contrast , systems with adatom and cluster diffusion exhibit steady - state distributions which are power laws @xcite .    in many physical systems ,",
    "the fragmentation kernel depends upon the masses of the chip size and the fragmenting cluster .",
    "for example , recent experiments on @xmath8 clusters sputtered from embedded @xmath8 nanoparticles report distinct chipping kernels for small and large clusters @xcite . in a related context , groups , herds , schools and flocks of animals also exhibit size - dependent fragmentation @xcite .",
    "similar observations have been made in the context of polymerization @xcite , gelation @xcite and complex networks @xcite . in all these systems , the steady - state distributions are either exponentials or power laws or their combinations .",
    "fragmentation is thus a ubiquitous phenomenon , observed in a variety of physical systems . in the present paper ,",
    "we study conserved mass models with mass - dependent chipping ",
    "the fragmentation rates depend on the chip size and mass of the fragmenting site .",
    "we obtain the steady - state mass distributions of these models in the mean - field ( mf ) limit , and compare them with results from monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",

    "the mass of the neighbor adds up , while that of the departure site decreases , with the total mass of the system remaining conserved .",

    "it is especially relevant in the context of fragmentation of sputtered clusters .",
