    "recent observational progress on the temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) has made primordial inflation  @xcite the most promising candidate to describe the early universe .",
    "being an effective description at a relatively low energy embedded in an ultraviolet complete theory , it is natural to expect that the inflationary lagrangian contains substructure which prevents otherwise smooth evolution of the universe during the entire inflationary epoch  @xcite .",
    "the resulting features in the primordial correlation functions imply enhanced interactions , giving rise to a unique observational window into the unknown physics of the parent theory .",
    "over the previous decade it has been shown that the primordial power spectrum reconstructed from the observed cmb data allows for the existence of features with roughly 5% modulations in the amplitude  @xcite .",
    "although there is no high confidence detection beyond the smooth power - law form of the primordial power spectrum , the search for features remains tantalizing due to their potential ability to rule out a large class of inflationary scenarios .",
    "furthermore , the existence of features in the power spectrum implies features also in higher order correlation functions .",
    "this suggests a compelling way to look for features in the bispectrum by using its correlation with the power spectrum .    in this article , using the primordial power spectrum reconstructed directly from the planck temperature data  @xcite , we search for scales and triangular configurations at which we would expect non - trivial signals in the bispectrum .",
    "the method described in this work , being both fast and accurate , provides an ideal platform to search for correlated features in the primordial bispectrum  @xcite .",
    "the explicit correlation between the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation @xmath4 and its bispectrum was first elucidated in  @xcite , where the features are sourced by a non - trivial speed of sound @xmath5 .",
    "this is motivated from an effective single field description of inflation when heavy degrees of freedom are systematically integrated out  @xcite .",
    "given that @xmath6 , we can explicitly find the leading contributions to the bispectrum @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was noted in  @xcite that the correlation between correlation functions can be further extended in the context of the generalized slow roll formalism ( gsr )  @xcite from the relation  @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 , with @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , is the gsr fundamental function and @xmath13/\\pi$ ] .",
    "then , the `` source '' of the power spectrum @xmath14 with @xmath15 can be written in terms of @xmath16 and its first two derivatives , i.e. @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "on totally general grounds , the bispectrum is specified by additional information on the source of the bispectrum @xmath19  @xcite , which is obtained from the cubic order action  @xcite . in the effective field theory viewpoint",
    "@xcite , the action at each order is specified by a set of mass scales @xmath20 , so that at quadratic order @xmath21 determines @xmath5 , while at cubic order @xmath22 is to be additionally specified , in principle , as an independent coupling .",
    "this is materialized as the bispectrum source @xmath19 , which is not generically written in terms of the power spectrum source @xmath23 and hence the power spectrum @xmath16 and its derivatives .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath19 can be explicitly connected to @xmath16 if we focus our attention on the case in which the most important source of features is specified .",
    "an example is given in @xcite  a varying @xmath5 gives rise to @xmath19 that has the same origin as @xmath23 , so we can specify the correlation .",
    "the same formula for @xmath7 can be derived using the gsr approximation  @xcite .",
    "another typical and important case is when the inflaton potential @xmath24 exhibits sudden changes , such as kinks and steps  @xcite . in that case , with @xmath25 , the dominant source of the features is the variation of @xmath26 , i.e. @xmath27 provided that inflation is not disturbed even with a violent variation of @xmath26 because @xmath28 at all times .",
    "then , gsr is a powerful tool to provide analytic results for the power spectrum  @xcite as well as the bispectrum  @xcite , which would otherwise require time - intensive numerical calculations  @xcite .",
    "the usual cubic action  @xcite is , however , not appropriate because a term with @xmath29 is contained in the field redefinition , which we should later restore by hand .",
    "it is thus desirable to use an alternative form where @xmath29 is explicit outside the field redefinition terms .",
    "this form is presented in  @xcite , and collecting only terms with @xmath29 , @xmath30 \\ , .\\ ] ] to compute the bispectrum it is convenient , since @xmath28 , to consider a perfect de sitter background @xmath31 .",
    "then @xmath29 can be written to leading order in gsr as @xmath32 plugging this expression into with the fluctuations given by the de sitter mode functions , we derive an alternative form to  @xcite connecting the bispectrum with the power spectrum and its first two derivatives :    @xmath33 ( 1-n_{{\\cal r } } ) \\nonumber\\\\ & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad \\left .",

    ", @xmath36 is the area squared of the triangle with three sides @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "furthermore , with the @xmath40 ansatz  @xcite in mind , we may define a dimensionless shape function @xmath41 this can be evaluated in any configuration of interest .",
    "in particular , we can reproduce the standard consistency relation in the squeezed limit , say , @xmath42 , @xmath43 for .",
    "note that is in agreement with the result of  @xcite , where using a different method this formula was derived with the @xmath44 and @xmath45 terms missing on the grounds that they are subleading and do not contribute in the squeezed limit .",
    "[ fig : compare ]    before applying to actual data , we have tested the veracity of gsr using a step potential  @xcite @xmath46 \\ , .\\ ] ] to this end , we numerically calculated the bispectrum using bingo  @xcite and compared it with the output of .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : compare ] , from which we observe excellent agreement , for parameters of the potential such that @xmath28 and @xmath47 .",
    "thus using gsr , if @xmath16 can be estimated independently of any specific inflationary model , one can make general statements regarding the location and magnitude of any potentially observable features in the bispectrum .",
    "however , for sharper departures from slow - roll , where one expects slow - roll parameters to be greater than unity , our leading - order analytic approximation starts deviating from the exact solution  @xcite and numerical computations such as bingo can provide the accurate results . finally note that we can use analytic templates as well to model sharp features like steps  @xcite .",
    "reconstruction of the primordial power spectrum using the cmb temperature data has been the subject of considerable research over the past decade .",
    "here we adopt the model - independent , non - parametric modified richardson - lucy algorithm  @xcite , which relates @xmath16 in @xmath48-space to the cmb temperature power spectrum @xmath49 using a convolution of the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the radiative transport kernel that contains information regarding the background cosmology and @xmath52 denotes the discrete @xmath48-space binning index .",
    "@xmath53 is obtained using the 2013 release of planck temperature data  @xcite , in which we use four frequency channels covering a multipole range @xmath54 .",
    "the removal of foregrounds and lensing , and the iterative procedure by which   is inverted to obtain @xmath55 along with all details pertaining to the reconstruction method can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the recovered @xmath55 possesses both features and unavoidable noise .",
    "indeed one can not make a clear distinction between them when using a model - independent reconstruction .",
    "however , the important point for our purposes is that the shape of the resulting @xmath55 is independent of any specific inflationary model , and the location of any significant deviations from a featureless power spectrum can direct our search for corresponding features in the bispectrum .     according to the procedure outlined in the text . here",
    "we plot the fractional deviation with respect to the best fit power - law model .",
    "the dark ( light ) shaded contours contain 68% ( 95% ) of the reconstructed @xmath55.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we generate @xmath56 gaussian realizations of @xmath53 .",
    "they are obtained by taking the existing data points and adding gaussian random fluctuations with variance equal to the diagonal component of the full error covariance matrix .",
    "each @xmath49 is then passed through the iterative procedure outlined in  @xcite to obtain a corresponding realization of @xmath55 .",
    "following this they are smoothed with a gaussian filter , and the resulting @xmath55 provides an improved fit compared to the baseline model .",
    "the result is exhibited in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "as reported in  @xcite , we find the maximum deviation from a featureless power spectrum lying at @xmath57 ( the other feature near @xmath58 was reported to be a systematic error in planck ) .",
    "we now take the @xmath56 reconstructed @xmath16 s and estimate their bispectra using . to do so",
    ", we must numerically calculate the first and second derivatives of @xmath55 .",
    "this is achieved by constructing a chebyshev spline to approximate a smooth continuous curve using @xmath52 points .",
    "we use @xmath59 chebyshev polynomials , where @xmath59 is an integer that dictates the smoothness of the splined curve .",
    "we choose @xmath59 such that the curve provides an equal @xmath60 fit to the planck temperature data as the non - parametric reconstruction .",
    "based on this criteria , we choose a value of @xmath61 : a smaller value degrades the fit , resulting in a larger @xmath62 and a curve that fails to capture the important features in the data , whereas a larger value introduces spurious oscillations that amount to capturing the noise .",
    "[ fig : fnlproj ]    differentiating the chebyshev fit , we calculate the bispectrum and exhibit @xmath40 given by projected onto certain configurations in figure  [ fig : fnlproj ] . in the squeezed configuration",
    ", there is a mild anomalous behaviour at @xmath63 , the same @xmath48-value for which the power spectrum exhibits a potential feature , however the amplitude of this deviation from a featureless bispectrum is very small . there is a larger amplitude discrepancy at @xmath64 .    in the equilateral limit ,",
    "the shaded region is larger than in the squeezed limit .",
    "this is expected as @xmath65 is no longer suppressed for this triangular configuration . here",
    "the bispectrum corresponding to a flat , featureless power spectrum lies within the @xmath66 bounding region for practically all @xmath48 .",
    "there are some oscillations , however these are likely to represent noise in the fitting procedure .",
    "we arrive at this conclusion by varying @xmath59 over @xmath67 : all @xmath59 in this range provide a roughly comparable fit to the data and the oscillations are not robust to varying @xmath59 .",
    "( top ) and @xmath68 ( bottom ) as a function of @xmath69 and @xmath70 , with @xmath71 .",
    "regions of interest are @xmath72 and @xmath73 , red ( blue ) contours in the top ( bottom ) panel , indicating areas where the featureless expectation value lies outside the @xmath66 contours.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    [ fig : fnl2d ]    given that we can reconstruct @xmath40 for any configuration , we can perform a general search in @xmath74 space for regions with significant deviations from the flat @xmath16 expectation .",
    "we focus on @xmath48-bands which are known to possess a feature in @xmath16 . specifically , we fix , say , @xmath75 , and explore the residual two - dimensional @xmath76 subspace .",
    "we are especially interested in any regions where the featureless expectation value of @xmath77 lies outside the @xmath66 bounded region of the reconstruction .",
    "hence for each point in the @xmath76 space , we calculate @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , where @xmath78 is the fiducial value of @xmath77 , calculated for a featureless @xmath16 with @xmath81 , and @xmath82 are the values that bound @xmath66 of the reconstructed @xmath40 from above and below . in figure",
    "[ fig : fnl2d ] we show @xmath83 and @xmath68 , plotting over the range @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the stripes correspond to oscillations in @xmath77 observed in figure  [ fig : fnlproj ] .",
    "of particular interest are regions where @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "these are the regions where the featureless @xmath77 lies outside the @xmath66 band , indicating possible features .",
    "they are exhibited as red ( blue ) contours in the top ( bottom ) panel of figure  [ fig : fnl2d ] .",
    "such behaviour is most clearly observed in the top left corner of the top panel in figure  [ fig : fnl2d ] , i.e. most pronounced in the squeezed limit .",
    "there are a small number of narrow oscillatory bands which deviate from the featureless limit , however this is likely the same manifestation of noise as found in the equilateral configuration .",
    "in this article we search for features in the bispectrum using the primordial power spectrum reconstructed from the angular power spectrum data of cmb temperature anisotropies .",
    "this is an important first step in extracting cmb three - point correlations directly from cmb two - point correlations of temperature fluctuations .",
    "the method presented is novel and allows a fast and reliable joint analysis of the cmb two- and three - point data . a model - independent reconstruction of the power spectrum can highlight the presence of features that we would expect to see in the bispectrum , and avoid model comparison with the data using a full markov chain monte carlo analysis .    using our method",
    ", we find that in the squeezed configuration around @xmath2 mpc@xmath1 and @xmath0 mpc@xmath1 there are potential features with marginal @xmath3 confidence . in the equilateral configuration",
    ", the reconstructions do not strongly constrain the form of the bispectrum - a featureless bispectrum is consistent but we can not rule out the possibility of large features being present .    given the large uncertainty , it is important to confront these findings with cmb three - point temperature correlations directly . a joint constraint on inflationary features using the two- and three - point correlations of temperature  @xcite and polarization anisotropies",
