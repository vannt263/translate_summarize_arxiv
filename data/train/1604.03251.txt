    "the earliest scientific work on pattern formation in granular media dates back to chladni  @xcite and faraday  @xcite who studied the now well - known heaping phenomenon in shallow layers of vibrating particles .",
    "there have been a renewed interest to understand the pattern - formation scenario in a vibrated granular bed starting from early 1990 s  @xcite and two comprehensive reviews on granular patterns till 2005 can be found in refs .  @xcite . since then",
    "a vertically shaken box of particles has become a canonical experimental setup to study granular patterns ; more specifically , under harmonic shaking via @xmath13 , such a system is known to admit a variety of interesting patterns : the standing waves , ` @xmath14 ' sub - harmonic waves via period - doubling bifurcations  @xcite , surface waves and heaping  @xcite , faraday waves and oscillons  @xcite , convection  @xcite and density - inverted state  @xcite .",
    "the primary control parameter for the onset and/or bifurcation of any of these patterns is the dimensionless shaking acceleration @xmath15 , which is a relative measure of the driving acceleration with respect to the gravitational acceleration @xmath3 . for a review on various patterns in",
    "a quasi-2d vibrated bed as well as to know the specific contributions of various research groups , we refer the readers to the introductory section of a recent work  @xcite . in the present experimental work ,",
    "we shall primarily focus on unveiling the transition scenario among different patterns ( the bouncing bed , the density - inverted state , the convection and the granular gas ) in a vibrofluidized bed with increasing @xmath4 , and this being a well - studied problem , here we provide only a brief review of the recent works of eshuis _ et al _",
    "@xcite and others which motivated the present study .",
    "the above mentioned density - inverted state was dubbed _",
    "granular _ leidenfrost state ( ls ) by eshuis  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite who established a possible connection with the original leidenfrost effect  @xcite : a liquid drop placed on a hot plate can float over its own vapor layer if the temperature of the plate exceeds a minimum value ( leidenfrost temperature ) . akin to this , a dense , compact layer of particles can be supported by a dilute gaseous region of fast moving particles underneath it in vertically shaken granular bed beyond critical value of the shaking intensity .",
    "more specifically , they found that a dense region of particles with crystalline - type structure can float over a granular gas at mild acceleration ( @xmath16 ) which bifurcates from a time - periodic bouncing bed state .",
    "previous molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations had also predicted the possibility of such _ density inversion _",

    "@xcite , on a shallow vertically - shaken granular materials held in a `` quasi-2d '' box ( of a few particle wide ) , provides the complete phase diagram of various patterns consisting of ( i ) solid bed , ( ii ) bouncing bed , ( iii ) sub - harmonic undulatory waves , ( iv ) granular leidenfrost state , ( v ) convection and ( vi ) granular gas .",
    "they also carefully documented the related bifurcation scenario for each pattern as a function of @xmath4 and the particle loading .",
    "they found that with increasing shaking intensity @xmath4 the convection - rolls can appear either ( i ) from the bouncing - bed state at small particle loading , or ( ii ) from the leidenfrost state at large particle loading . on the other hand ,",
    "the primary onset of the leidenfrost state was found to occur from the undulatory waves with increasing @xmath4 , however , the undulatory state can also exist over a range of @xmath4 between two leidenfrost states ( at lower and higher values of @xmath4 ) .",
    "the latter finding implies that two successive bifurcations from a `` sub - harmonic '' wavy - state to the leidenfrost state resulted to the onset of convection at large particle loadings .",
    "it must be noted that the temporal - order of the leidenfrost state was never quantified  @xcite via experiments , but it appears to be a quasi - steady or steady state from the related theoretical analyses  @xcite . in any case , the convection - rolls found at strong shaking ( i.e.  at large values of @xmath17 ) are the granular analog of rayleigh - benard convection , and they must be differentiated from the so - called `` boundary - driven '' convection  @xcite that appear at milder shaking ( @xmath18 ) .    in this work",
    "we carry out experiments in a purely two - dimensional ( 2d ) container that can accomodate only one layer of particles along the depth of the container , and in doing so we uncover the complete sequence of bifurcations in a 2d - vibrofluidized bed as well as provide quantitative results about different patterned states . in a quasi-2d setup of a few - particle diameter depth , such as that employed by eshuis  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , it is difficult to obtain quantitative data on ( i ) the hydrodynamic fields ( density , granular temperature and velocity ) as well as on ( ii ) particle - level quantities ( microstructure , distribution function , etc . ) . such quantitative measurements are however possible in pure 2d - container that can accommodate a mono - layer of particles along its depth as in the experimental work of eshuis  _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "our primary focus is to ( i ) to quantify the onset of the transition from the bouncing bed to the leidenfrost state in terms of different control parameters , ( ii ) to analyze the microstructure in the latter state and related signatures of transition , ( iii ) to quantify the temporal - order ( steady or time - periodic ) of the leidenfrost state , and finally ( iv ) to uncover the possible routes to transition of the ls to convection and eventually to a gas .",
    "the characteristics and distinguishing features of different states have also been probed with the help of their mean - fields , namely , the density and temperature profiles along the vertical direction .",

    "<S> experiments are conducted in a two - dimensional mono - layer vibrofluidized bed of glass beads , with a goal to understand the transition scenario and the underlying microstructure and dynamics in different patterned - states . at small shaking accelerations ( @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the amplitude and angular frequency of shaking and @xmath3 is the gravitational acceleration ) </S>",
    "<S> , the particles remain attached with the base of the vibrating container  this is known as the solid bed ( sb ) . with increasing @xmath4 ( at large enough shaking amplitude @xmath5 ) and/or with increasing @xmath5 ( at large enough @xmath4 ) , the sequence of transitions / bifurcations unfolds as follows : sb ( `` solid bed '' ) to bb ( `` bouncing bed '' ) to ls ( `` leidenfrost state '' ) to `` 2-roll convection '' to `` 1-roll convection '' and finally to a gas - like state . </S>",
    "<S> for a given length of the container , the coarsening of multiple convection rolls leading to the genesis of a `` single - roll '' structure ( dubbed the _ multi - roll transition _ ) , and its subsequent transition to a granular - gas are two novel findings of this work . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the critical shaking intensity ( @xmath6 ) for `` @xmath7''-transition has a power - law dependence on the particle loading ( @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the number of particle layers at rest and @xmath10 is the particle diameter ) and the shaking amplitude ( @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristics of @xmath11 and @xmath12 states are studied by calculating ( i ) the coarse - grained density and temperature profiles and ( ii ) the pair correlation function . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that while the contact network of particles in the bb - state represents a hexagonal - packed structure , the contact network within the `` floating - cluster '' of the ls resembles a liquid - like state . </S>",
    "<S> an unsteadiness of the leidenfrost state has been uncovered wherein the interface ( between the floating - cluster and the dilute collisional layer underneath ) and the top of the bed are found to oscillate sinusoidally , with its oscillation frequency closely matching with the frequency of external shaking . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the granular leidenfrost state is a period-1 wave as is the case for bb - state . </S>"
