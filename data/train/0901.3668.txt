    "the ability of a conductor to carry electric current is characterized by its conductance @xmath6 equal to the ratio of the current carried through to the voltage across the conductor .",
    "@xmath6 is finite because of scattering on impurities and lattice defects , which prevents the electrons from propagating ballistically , along straight lines , transforming their trajectories into random walks with a step size @xmath7 .",
    "the conductance @xmath6 depends on the exact configuration of impurities inside the conductor .",
    "the ensemble average of the conductance , @xmath8 , can be expressed as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 represents the average over an ensemble of random impurity configurations , @xmath11 is the dimensionless conductance , @xmath12 is the electron charge , and @xmath13 is the planck constant .",
    "deviations of conductance from its average value , @xmath14 , arise from the interference of electronic wavefunctions and , for this reason , are only important in the mesoscopic regime , i.e. , when the electronic wavefunction is phase coherent .",
    "a prominent feature of electronic transport in mesoscopic systems is the universal conductance fluctuations ( ucf ) : @xmath15 , for any metal , independent of sample size or disorder strength @xcite .",
    "the ucf can be expressed in terms of @xmath11 as @xmath16 .",
    "there is a remarkable analogy between electronic transport in mesoscopic systems and wave propagation in random media @xcite .",
    "the dimensionless conductance @xmath11 can be defined for classical waves as the transmittance @xmath17 , that is , the sum over transmission coefficients @xmath18 from an incident mode @xmath19 to an outgoing mode @xmath20 , at a given frequency @xmath21 , @xmath22 . here",
    "the modes @xmath19 and @xmath20 correspond to transverse eigenmodes of the empty waveguide and form a complete set of basis functions , sufficient to represent any wave field entering or leaving the waveguide . a given mode @xmath19",
    "is characterized by a transverse wave vector @xmath23 .",
    "the statement of ucf is then equivalent to @xmath24 .",
    "the origin of ucf can be traced to correlations of transmission coefficients @xmath18 of a random sample .",

    "is often referred to as a `` long - range '' correlation function .",
    "its contribution to @xmath37 is still much less than unity .",
    "it is @xmath38  the smallest of the three correlation functions and independent of @xmath19 , @xmath39 , @xmath20 and @xmath40  that explains ucf : @xmath41 . because @xmath42 does not decay neither with @xmath33 nor with @xmath32 , it is reffered to as an `` infinite - range '' correlation function .",
    "ucf have been extensively studied in mesoscopic systems both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite ( see refs .   and for reviews ) .",
    "they have also been demonstrated in random media , with light @xcite and microwaves @xcite , through the observation of the infinite - range ( @xmath42 ) intensity correlation .",
    "however , all studies of ucf yet conducted have only concerned the steady - state conductance . in this paper",
    ", we study fluctuations of the time - dependent conductance of a disordered system by means of diagrammatic theory and microwave pulsed transmission measurements .",
    "we show that the universality of conductance fluctuations is lost in the dynamic experiment : the fluctuations depend on the length of the sample and the mean free path @xmath7 .",
    "the variance of normalized transmittance is observed to increase as a third power of delay time from an exciting pulse .",
    "a comparative analysis of the underlying mesoscopic correlations allows us to identify a new characteristic time scale @xmath43 , @xmath4 being the diffusion time , at which @xmath0 grows larger than @xmath2 .",
    "in order to study the dynamic conductance fluctuations , we consider a pulsed wave propagating through a quasi-1d waveguide with static disorder , of cross section @xmath44 and length @xmath45 , parallel to the @xmath46-axis .",
    "this geometry also corresponds to the theoretical model of a disordered mesoscopic conductor . a pulsed excitation @xmath47 at a point @xmath48 on the input surface @xmath49 of the waveguide ( @xmath50 ) results in a complex intensity distribution @xmath51 at the output surface @xmath52 of the waveguide ( @xmath53 ) .",
