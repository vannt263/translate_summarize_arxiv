    "charge symmetry violation ( csv ) , in itself , is an interesting physical phenomenon . while the charge symmetry ( cs ) implies that the interaction between two neutrons or two protons are equal , but , in nature , this is found to be only approximately true .",
    "the violation of cs automatically violates charge independence ( ci ) , however , the converse might not be always true @xcite .",
    "it is possible to have cs even if the ci is violated which actually is a higher symmetry .",
    "the csv , at the qcd level , is caused by the splitting of @xmath5-@xmath6 quark masses .",
    "experimentally csv can be observed at various levels .",
    "for instance , in @xmath2 interaction , the effect of csv is traditionally inferred from the difference of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 scattering lengths in the @xmath9 state .",
    "the most recent scattering data @xcite observes that the amount of csv in the @xmath9 state is @xmath10 , where the superscript @xmath11 indicates the ` nuclear ' effect obtained after the electromagnetic ( em ) corrections",
    ". other convincing evidence of csv @xmath2 interaction comes from the binding energy difference of mirror nuclei which is known as okamoto - nolen -schifer ( ons ) anomaly @xcite .",
    "the modern manifestation of csv includes difference of neutron - proton form factors , hadronic correction to @xmath12 @xcite and the observation of the decay of @xmath13 etc @xcite .    in the present work we focus on the hadronic sector , and , in particular",
    ", we attempt to construct csv potential for the @xmath2 interaction in one boson exchange ( obe ) model by invoking momentum dependent @xmath0-@xmath4 mixing .",
    "the fact that the neutron and proton masses are not degenerate , the various isospin pure resonant states like @xmath0-@xmath4 or @xmath14-@xmath15 can , in reality , mix without violating any conservation principles dictated by other symmetries . in particular , the @xmath0-@xmath4 mixing seems to be a viable mechanism for the generation of significant amount of csv @xcite .",
    "the earlier construction of csv potential involved on - shell mixing of the @xmath0 and @xmath4 meson states @xcite . a whole class of phenomenon including the difference of @xmath8-@xmath7 scattering length , binding energy difference of @xmath16-@xmath17 , or ons anomoly in general",
    "could be successfully explained via @xmath0-@xmath4 mixing @xcite .",
    "however , in ref.@xcite such a success was severely criticised on ground that the on - shell mixing amplitude differs quite significantly as one extrapolates the results from the @xmath3 ( or @xmath4 ) pole to the space - like region which is relevant for the construction of the csv potential .",
    "goldman , henderson and thomas @xcite showed the strong @xmath18 dependence of @xmath0-@xmath4 mixing to csv potential using a simple quark model .",
    "similar results were reported in ref.@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that such momentum dependencies suppress the contribution of @xmath0-@xmath4 mixing and also changes the sign of the mixing amplitude as one moves away from the @xmath3 and @xmath4 poles .",
    "on the other hand miller @xcite and coon _ et al _ @xcite have advanced counter arguments that would restore the traditional role of @xmath0-@xmath4 mixing .",
    "the issue is still unresolved .",
    "informative summaries of the controversial point of views can be found in refs .",
    "subsequently , several other calculations were also performed including qcd sum - rule @xcite with varied conclusions .",
    "recently machleidt and mther @xcite have discussed various csv mechanism to estimate the @xmath9 scattering length .",
    "therefore , the issues , including @xmath0-@xmath4 mixing as the origin of the csv force , seem to be quite open which provide part of the motivation of the present work .",
    "here we revisit the problem of @xmath0-@xmath4 mixing and invoke the mechanism adopted in @xcite _",
    "i. e. _ the mixing is driven by the neutron - proton mass difference .",
    "although the driving mechanism is same , the main difference of our work with that presented in ref.@xcite resides in the treatment of the external legs . this is another source of csv due to the non - degenerate nucleon mass .",
    "this , as we shall see , has serious consequence which even modify the central part of the csv potential .",
    "we highlight the importance of @xmath19 tensor interaction and show how this can counter balance the weakening of the strength of csv interaction even when one extrapolates @xcite the results from on - shell to off - shell .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "in section ii we present the formalism where three momentum dependent @xmath0-@xmath4 mixing amplitude is used for the construction of csv potential .",
    "the numerical results including the contributions of external legs and the @xmath19 tensor coupling to csv potential are discussed in section iii .",
    "finally , we summarize in section iv .",
