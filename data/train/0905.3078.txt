    "although the existence of dark matter was already established by zwicky in 1933 @xcite , its origin and nature is still unknown .",
    "several models were proposed to explain the missing matter , among others weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , sterile neutrinos , regular neutrinos , massive astrophysical compact halo objects ( machos ) and also primordial black holes ( pbhs ) .",
    "machos and regular neutrinos have been shown to have a negligible effect on dark matter .",
    "primordial black holes , on the other hand , can contribute up to 100% in the mass range @xmath0  g  @xmath4  g. here , @xmath5 is the mass of the primordial black hole . below and above this mass range ,",
    "the contribution of pbhs to the dark matter is constrained , with current limits shown in fig .",
    "[ pbh_limits : fig ] : pbhs with masses at @xmath6  g are expected to evaporate in the local universe , with a unique signature of high - energy photon emission with energies above @xmath7  mev .",
    "measurements by the egret experiment do not show any evidence of pbh evaporation signatures and the contribution of pbhs to dark matter is strongly constrained to a fraction of less than @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "new data from the fermi experiment will provide further improvement to this limit .",
    "the region above @xmath1  g is constrained to a level of less than @xmath3 of the dark matter and for pbhs of the order of solar masses and above , constraints are much more stringent , up to @xmath9 , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .        in this paper",
    ", we investigate if it is possible to detect pbhs , or alternatively to constrain their contribution to the dark matter , by their interactions with stellar objects in the galaxy . in order to do this ,",
    "we discuss the following questions : in section [ interaction : sec ] , we discuss how often interactions between pbhs and stellar objects happen .",
    "we answer the question of the energy loss in a single passage in section [ energy_loss : sec ] . in section [",
    "captures : sec ] , we investigate at what point is the pbh captured by stellar objects and possible consequences .",
    "section [ conclusions : sec ] discusses the results .",
    "all our results are based on simple estimates , without considering exact distributions of the pbh masses , velocities or the spatial distribution of dark matter .",
    "effects of including these effects are either negligible or would decrease the sensitivity to the observation of pbh interactions ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give an upper limit on possible effects .",
    "in the following calculation , we consider the interaction of pbhs with four classes of objects : main sequence stars ( ms@xmath10 ) , red giant cores ( rgc ) , white dwarfs ( wd ) and neutron stars ( n@xmath10 ) the rate of pbh interactions with a class of stellar objects is given by @xmath11 here , @xmath12 is the number of stellar objects in the considered class .",
    "the flux of primordial black holes , @xmath13 , is given by the product of the pbhs number density @xmath14 with their velocity @xmath15 : @xmath16 we use the measured rotational velocity of matter in the galaxy as the relative velocity between pbhs and stellar objects , @xmath17  cms@xmath18 .",
    "the number density of primordial black holes can be determined by assuming that pbhs represent a fraction @xmath19 of the dm in the galactic halo , @xmath20 .",
    "the spherical halo has an approximate radius of @xmath21  kpc .",
    "we further assume that all pbhs are produced at the same mass value @xmath5 , with @xmath5 as a free parameter .",
    "thus , the number density of pbhs is @xmath22 and the event rate can be written as @xmath23 the cross section of a pbh interacting with a star is given as @xmath24 here , we use the conservation of angular momentum in order to estimate the impact parameter @xmath25 , which guarantees the collision with the star .",
    "angular momentum conservation gives the relation @xmath26 with the pbh s velocity @xmath27 when it reaches the surface of the star .",
    "the final velocity is determined using energy conservation : @xmath28 with @xmath29 as the mass of the stellar object .",
    "the characteristic distance of the pbh entering the gravitational field of the star can be approximated as the typical distance between objects in the galaxy , @xmath30 , assuming that each star - like objects deflects the pbh at least marginally .",
    "we assume this typical distance to be @xmath31  pc .",
    "the gravitational energy is negligible in the initial state  pc , we get @xmath32  cms@xmath18 ] and the final velocity can be expressed as @xmath34 using equ .",

    "apart from the pbh mass , which we leave as a variable , the remaining parameters depend on the property of the astrophysical objects considered . the basic properties of the source classes are listed in table [ source_class_properties : tab ] .",
