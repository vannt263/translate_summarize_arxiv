    "the _ spitzer _ space telescope opens a unique mid- and far - infrared window to the exploration of massive star formation not only in our galaxy but also in our neighboring dwarf galaxies , the large and small magellanic cloud ( lmc , smc ) .",
    "stellar associations in both the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) contain the richest sample of young bright stars in these galaxies , and consequently our knowledge on their young massive stars has been collected from studies of such stellar systems ( see e.g. massey 2002 ) .",
    "furthermore , almost every mcs association coincide with one or more h  ii regions , as they have been earlier cataloged ( henize 1956 ; davies et al .",
    "1976 ) , and it has been shown that the measured h  fluxes are in excellent agreement with those expected from the ionizing flux of the detected massive stars ( massey 1993 ) .",
    "however , mcs associations are not mere aggregates of young bright stars alone , but they also host large numbers of faint pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars , as recent hst studies showed for both the lmc ( gouliermis et al .",
    "2006 ) and the smc ( nota et al .",
    "both , the existence of h  ii regions and pms stars in stellar associations of the mcs indicate that star formation may be still active in their vicinity , and _ spitzer",
    "_ offers a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis .    indeed , using _ spitzer _",
    "observations , jones et al .",
    "( 2005 ) reported four young stellar objects ( ysos ) in the h  ii complex n 159 ( located in the vicinity of the association lh 105 ; lucke & hodge 1970 ) in the lmc .",
    "chu et al .",
    "( 2005 ) obtained _ spitzer _ observations of the super - bubble n 51d ( associations lh  51/54 ) in the lmc and they found three ysos projected within the super - bubble .",
    "images from the _ hubble _ space telescope ( hst ) in h  and [ s ii ] allowed them to identify dust globules associated with two of them .",
    "the third yso was associated with the first herbig - haro object detected outside the galaxy .",
    "furthermore , meixner et al . ( 2006 ) in their presentation of the first results from the _ spitzer _ space telescope survey of the lmc legacy project _ surveying the agents of a galaxy s evolution _ ( sage ) , show as a test - case epoch 1 data of the area of two h  ii regions , n 79/n 83 ( associations lh 2/lh 5 ) .",
    "they found that mips 70  and 160  images of the diffuse dust emission of the regions reveal a distribution similar to the gas emissions , especially the h i 21 cm emission , and they note that the measured point - source sensitivity for the epoch 1 data is consistent with expectations for the survey .",
    "bolatto et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , recently , presented their results from the _ spitzer _ survey of the small magellanic cloud ( s@xmath1mc ) , which imaged the star - forming body of the smc in all seven mips and irac wave bands .",
    "these authors compiled a photometric catalog of 400,000 mid- and far - infrared point sources in the smc , from which they identified 282 bright candidate ysos as bright 5.8  sources with very faint optical counterparts and very red mid - infrared colors ( [ 5.8]@xmath2[8.0 ] @xmath3 1.2 mag ) .",

    "general description of the mid - infrared characteristics of the region is given in  3 , and in  4 the point sources detected with our photometry , and the selection of candidate ysos are presented .",
    "the recent release of high - resolution data on ngc  602/n  90 obtained with the _ advanced camera for surveys _ on _ hubble _ space telescope allowed us a detailed photometric study of the stellar association and its surroundings down to the faint red pre - main sequence stars of the system ( schmalzl et al .",

    "finally , general conclusions of this study are given in  6 .",
    "the imaging data of our study have been obtained with the _ infrared array camera _ ( irac ; fazio et al .",
    "2004 ) on - board _ spitzer",
    "_ space telescope ( werner et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the images are publicly available and are downloaded from the _ spitzer _ space telescope archive using the leopard package .",
    "these observations ( dataset archive i d : aor 12485120 ) were obtained within the gto science program 125 ( pi : g. fazio ) on 28 november 2004 .",
    "we retrieved the post basic calibrated data ( pbcd ) for all four irac channels ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8  and 8.0 ) , which are already fully co - added and calibrated .",
    "after visual inspection of the images we carried out psf - photometry with the daophot package provided within the iraf environment . in the case of the region of ngc  602/n  90 , psf photometry is required as the field is too crowded for aperture photometry to be appropriately applied . consequently , for each filter we constructed a reference psf by combining the psf of at least 5 objects with a high signal to noise ratio and we used this psf to fit all objects identified with a 3-@xmath4 confidence level over the local background .",
    "we converted the pixel values in each filter from mjysr@xmath5 to dns@xmath5 according to `` irac data handbook '' version 5.1.1 and we computed the corresponding magnitudes as @xmath6 with @xmath7 denoting the flux measured in dns@xmath5 and @xmath8 being the zero point for each filter .",
    "zero points were taken from hartmann et al .",
    "( 2005 ) : 19.66 ( 3.6 ) , 18.94 ( 4.5 ) , 16.88 ( 5.8 ) and 17.39 ( 8.0 ) .",
    "for the initial psf fit we used a psf size of 2 pixel , and applied aperture corrections as described in the `` irac data handbook '' to obtain the final magnitudes . finally , we cross - matched the obtained catalogs for each filter to identify the sources that are detected in more than one irac bands , by allowing a maximum offset of 2 pixels for the center of each point source .",
    "_ spitzer _ covers a suitable wavelength range ( 3.6 - 160 ) for defining the dust properties of the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the mid - infrared channels of irac ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8 ) are good tracers of the smallest grains through polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission .",
    "very small grains ( typical sizes 12 - 150  ) and pahs ( typical sizes 4 - 12  ; desert et al .",
    "1990 ) are very efficient in heating the gas through the photoelectric effect ( bakes & tielens 1994 ) and therefore their analysis is very important for understanding the thermodynamics of the ism .",
    "iras data on both lmc and smc suggest a deficit of the smallest dust grains in the low - metallicity environments of these galaxies due to the lower 12  emission in comparison to the milky way and other higher metallicity galaxies ( schwering 1989 ; sauvage et al .",
    "a study in the smc by stanimirovi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) concluded that the dust in the smc is dominated by large grains .",
    "the lower abundance of pahs and very small grains in the smc is also supported by detailed modeling of smc uv absorption and fir emission data by weingartner & draine ( 2001 ) , li & draine ( 2002 ) , and clayton et al .",
    "a different grain size distribution with respect to the galaxy , or grain destruction , possibly due to the intense uv radiation and/or by supernova shocks have been proposed to explain the very small grain paucity in both galaxies .",
    "the absence of pahs and very small grains has a profound influence on the gas heating and the existence of cold and warm phases in the interstellar medium ( wolfire et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the images of ngc  602/n  90 taken with _ spitzer _ , which we present here , can be used for a qualitative analysis on the dust properties and its relation to stellar sources of radiation in the region of ngc  602 . a color composite image from irac channels 1 , 2 and 4",

    "[ irac - maps ] reveal the stars , whereas the red color ( 8 ) shows mainly the diffuse dust emission .",
    "specifically , the origin of diffuse emission at 3.6  is likely to originate partly from bound - free transitions in the ionized gas with some contribution from the 3.29  emission near molecular clouds ( thought to be due to c@xmath2h bond stretching in pahs ) and very small dust grain emission ( e.g. engelbracht et al .",
    "the 4.5  diffuse emission is a combination of bound - free continuum and brackett-@xmath9 recombination emission in h  ii regions .",
    "both the 5.8 and 8.0  bands show molecular material in the interstellar medium ( ism ) and circumstellar envelopes , as well as increasingly faint stellar photospheres .",

    "it encompass the 5.6 and 6.2 pah band emission .",
    "the origin of the 8  diffuse emission is most likely the very bright emission complex at 7 - 9  thought to be dominated by c@xmath2c stretching modes ( with some contribution from in - plane c@xmath2h bending ) of the bonds in pahs and very small carbonaceous dust grains ( jger et al .",

    "we attempt to address these issues by plotting the cmd of all stars from our acs photometry , that are associated with the candidate ysos found with irac . the part of a @xmath18 , @xmath15 cmd , which is expected to be occupied by pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars of star - forming regions in the mcs observed with _",
    "hubble _ is fairly known ( e.g. gouliermis et al .",
    "2006 , nota et al .",
    "this cmd for the optical sources related to the candidate ysos in the region of ngc  602/n  90 , plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig - cmdpms ] , shows that all of the stars found to coincide with the candidate ysos in our sample are actually pms stars , suggesting that either we probably observe the existence of compact pms star clusters recently formed ( or currently under formation ) around typical ysos , or that the sources identified as candidate ysos _ are _ themselves unresolved young pms clusters . in either case",
    "it is almost certain that these stellar concentrations demonstrate possible events of extragalactic clustered star formation on the act .",
    "if so , it would be interesting to know how long ago this formation took place .    to answer this question , on the cmd of fig .",
    "[ fig - cmdpms ] we also plot pms evolutionary tracks from the models by palla & stahler ( 1999 ) , and two indicative isochrones ( for 0.1 and 5 myr ) and the zero age main sequence ( zams ) from the same models",
    ". simulations of the positions at the @xmath18 , @xmath15 cmd of all pms stars found in the region of ngc  602/n  90 by schmalzl et al .",
    "( 2007 ) indicate that reddening , variability and binarity are important factors , which cause a spread of the loci of pms stars in this cmd and that even modest interstellar reddening ( schmalzl et al .",
    "find @xmath19  0.04  -  0.06  mag for the association ngc  602 ) can make these stars appear younger ( being `` pushed '' to redder colors ) . considering these results and the plot of fig .",
    "[ fig - cmdpms ] , one may conclude that the pms stars , which coincide with the candidate ysos of our sample do not seem to be older than about 5 myr , giving an upper limit to the time - scale within which these clusters were formed .    for a more detailed analysis one should concentrate on the stellar content of each of the individual clusters , but in most of the cases very low numbers of stars per cluster",
    "do not allow such an analysis .",
    "we selected the most populous among the identified clusters ( the ones corresponding to candidate ysos no 22 , 29 , 51 and 54 ) to plot their individual cmds , but the stellar numbers were still not enough to define a more narrow age range .",
    "pms stars are mainly red sources , and therefore near - infrared imaging with cameras equipped with adaptive optics ( ao ) systems would provide the necessary resolution for a richer sample of pms stellar members in these clusters .",
    "indeed , high resolution near - infrared observations of these clusters would certainly be very useful , because they would 1 ) provide better statistics with higher numbers of detected members , enough to plot the cmds of individual clusters and 2 ) fill the gap between optical and mid - infrared wavelengths , providing near - infrared magnitudes for these pms stars .",
    "the later information will offer the opportunity to construct accurate spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of candidate ysos , to be compared to models .    as far as candidate ysos that coincide with no more than two pms stars concerns , in fig .",
    "[ fig - ysosamples ] we also show several different cases of `` single '' candidate ysos ( e.g. objects no 1 , 5 , 49 , 53 ) , but as their images show it is unclear if such sources are indeed single isolated objects or embedded clusters ( as the faint magnitudes given in table [ tab - yso ] suggest ) , or even one massive embedded protostar .",
    "modeling of the seds of such objects is quite difficult , in the sense that many different models seem to fit the seds , due to their small number of points , and near - infrared ao observations would certainly add three more points to the seds , throwing more light toward this direction as well .",
    "it is worth noting that fig .",
    "[ fig - ysosamples ] also demonstrates few interesting cases of candidate ysos ( objects no 26 , 49 , 34 , 35 , 46 and 53 ) , both with and without optical counterparts , which are located at the edge of features similar to the `` pillars of creation '' or `` elephant trunks '' in the galactic h  ii region m  16 ( the eagle nebula ; hester et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the sample of candidate ysos derived from our irac photometry in the region of ngc  602/n  90 ( table [ tab - yso ] ) is based on a single classification scheme .",
    "as a consequence , although it is almost certain that this sample does include true ysos , there is always a possibility that it also includes sources misidentified as ysos , like small h  ii regions , or that it is quite incomplete not including all possible true ysos , like the class i ysos in the sample of allen et al .",
    "the identification of pms stars in the areas of the candidate ysos as their optical counterparts indicates that half of these objects are not single sources .",
    "but , considering the difficulty of modeling the seds of these objects , it is not straightforward to clarify which of them represent embedded proto - clusters . in the case of candidate ysos",
    "coinciding with one or two pms stars , there is no information if there should be more optical counterparts , which simply were not detected in our acs photometry , or if these are indeed single proto - stellar objects .    in any case , the composite acs image of the area of ngc  602/n  90 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - ysomap ] provides evidence that sequential star formation does take place in the area and especially on the dust ridges of a cavity , which seems to extend outwards .",
    "this feature is most probably the product of photoionization by the young association , ngc  602 , located almost at its center . the combination of both acs ( fig .",
    "[ fig - ysomap ] ) and irac ( fig .",
    "[ irac - maps ] ) observations provides a more complete image of the star formation in the area .",
    "specifically , taking into account the loci of the sources classified as candidate ysos , the ism features shown in the image from acs , and the 8  emission shown in the irac image , one may conclude that in the observed area the stellar association ngc  602 ionizes the surrounding material giving birth to the h  ii region , n  90 , and producing a cavity in the remaining of its parental molecular cloud .",
    "this event triggers sequential star formation not later than @xmath11  5  myr ago , which seems to propagate mostly to the east and south .",
    "this second star formation event may be characterized by higher a concentration of ysos , most of which may be related to compact pms clusters .",
    "this scenario is also supported by the study of the pms population in ngc  602 and its surroundings by schmalzl et al .",
    "we present our results from _ spitzer_/irac photometry on the star - forming region ngc  602/n  90 in the small magellanic cloud .",
    "we performed psf photometry on irac images taken in four mid - infrared channels ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8  and 8.0 ) centered on the h  ii region n  90 .",
    "we identified 57 objects in all four channels and 44 in channels 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "we classified the sources found in all four irac channels from their loci in the [ 3.6]@xmath2[8.0 ] , [ 8.0 ] color - magnitude diagram , based on templates and models for different red sources in the milky way , and the [ 5.8]@xmath2[8.0 ] , [ 3.6]@xmath2[4.5 ] color - color diagram , according to the classification scheme developed by bolatto et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for smc ysos .",
    "according to our classification there are 22 candidate ysos in the region of ngc  602/n  90 .",
    "we use our results from psf photometry in the filters @xmath15 and @xmath17 of the same region from imaging with the wide - field channel of acs on - board the _ hubble _ space telescope ( schmalzl et al .",
    "2007 ) to identify optical sources , which coincide with the candidate ysos .",
    "all these optical sources are identified as pms stars .",
    "we found that almost half of the candidate ysos match with no more than two pms stars , but examination of their loci on the acs images does not exclude the possibility that there may be more highly embedded sources or not well resolved also in the optical .",
    "the remaining candidate ysos coincide with more than 3 pms stars , and four of them seem to include small compact pms clusters of 7 ( or more ) stars .",
    "we found that these stars are probably formed earlier than 5 myr ago , according to pms evolutionary models .",
    "we could not find any optical counterpart for five ysos , two of which are located outside the field observed with acs .    from the positions of the detected candidate ysos",
    ", we conclude that they are probably the products of a sequential star formation process , which presumably propagates mostly to the east and south , on the ridges of the molecular cloud , as they formed from the photo - ionizing process of the stellar association ngc  602 located in the center of the apparent cavity of the cloud .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that our sample of candidate ysos may be contaminated by other objects like small h  ii regions , or it may not include some true ysos . based on our results",
    "we stress the importance of high - resolution near - infrared imaging of the candidate ysos in order 1 ) to resolve more faint red stellar sources and detect a higher number of related pms stars , and 2 ) to fill the wavelength gap between optical and mid - infrared by providing near - infrared measurements of all detected sources , so that their seds will be thoroughly modeled , as well as of high - resolution radio observations , which will provide additional information on the ionizing flux for the identified objects .",
