    "in fermionic matter which is sufficiently cold and dense , any attractive interaction at the fermi surface leads to the formation of cooper pairs @xcite .",
    "the cooper pairs form a bose condensate , so that exciting a quasiparticle costs an amount of energy @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the gap energy .",

    "one - gluon exchange between two quarks is attractive in the color - antitriplet channel .",
    "one therefore expects that at sufficiently large quark chemical potential @xmath6 and sufficiently small temperature @xmath7 quarks condense into cooper pairs which are color antitriplets .",
    "this condensate breaks the @xmath8 color symmetry of the ground state , and gives rise to _",
    "color superconductivity_. for qcd , this phenomenon was first investigated by barrois @xcite , by bailin and love @xcite , and others @xcite . in seminal work ,",
    "bailin and love estimated the gap energy to be on the order of @xmath9 . since the critical temperature for the onset of superconductivity , @xmath10 , is of the order of the gap energy , @xmath5 , a color - superconducting phase of quark matter could form in the interior of neutron stars .",
    "color superconductivity was also studied in an @xmath11 gauge theory @xcite .",
    "interest in this subject was renewed through works by alford , rajagopal , and wilczek @xcite and by rapp , schfer , shuryak , and velkovsky @xcite . in these papers ,",
    "the attractive interaction was modeled with the instanton vertex . in the framework of a simple model of the type studied by nambu and jona - lasinio ( njl ) @xcite ,",
    "these authors found gap energies of the order of @xmath12 .",
    "since @xmath13 , for gap energies of this order of magnitude color superconductivity is no longer only relevant for astrophysical scenarios , it could also occur in relativistic heavy - ion collisions , whenever the bombarding energy is large enough to form relatively cold , baryon - rich quark - gluon matter .",
    "the maximum amount of baryon stopping was found in heavy - ion collisions at ags energies , @xmath14 agev ; therefore , the most favorable conditions to form a color - superconducting phase of quark - gluon matter would occur in nuclear collisions somewhere in the energy range from @xmath15 to @xmath16 agev , i.e. , from gsi ",
    "sis to cern  sps energies .",
    "most studies of color superconductivity assumed that only the two lightest quark flavors , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , form cooper pairs .",
    "this is based on the argument that , due to the larger strange quark mass , @xmath19 mev , the fermi surfaces of non - strange and strange quarks do not match @xcite , consequently there are no @xmath20 or @xmath21 cooper pairs . however , for a system where @xmath22 , this mismatch is , to leading order in @xmath6 , only of order @xmath23 , and therefore vanishes at sufficiently large chemical potential .",
    "based on this observation , alford , rajagopal , and wilczek suggested a new form of color superconductivity , where all three flavors condense to lock the breaking of color and flavor symmetry @xcite .",
    "comparison with earlier investigations @xcite of the patterns of symmetry breaking in chiral models revealed @xcite that the color - flavor locked state is energetically favored .",
    "this was independently confirmed by schfer and wilczek in a numerical study of the effective potential @xcite .",
    "other studies which investigated the interplay of color superconductivity and chiral symmetry breaking at finite temperature include those of berges and rajagopal @xcite and langfeld and rho @xcite .",
    "color superconductivity was also investigated via renormalization group techniques by evans , hsu , and schwetz @xcite and by schfer and wilczek @xcite .",
    "all of these studies were based exclusively on njl - type models .",
    "the sole exception is the work of son @xcite who applied renormalization group techniques to study the scale of the energy gap in qcd .",
    "he pointed out that non - instantaneous one - gluon exchange modifies the weak - coupling expression for the gap , @xmath24 to @xmath25 ; this was also noted in @xcite .",
    "this increases the likelihood to find color superconductivity at nonzero temperature .",
    "a quark - quark condensate @xmath26 is a @xmath27 matrix in color space ( @xmath28 ) , a @xmath29 matrix in flavor space ( @xmath30 ) , and a @xmath31 matrix in dirac space ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "quark pair condensation can in principle occur in channels with arbitrary total spin @xmath33 .",
    "most previous studies indicate , however , that condensation in the channel with total spin @xmath34 is favored for two or more flavors .    in this work , we shall not discuss the color or flavor structure of the gap matrix @xcite , but rather focus on the dirac structure .",
    "to do so , it is sufficient to study a simpler model , where fermions interact via the exchange of scalar bosons , @xmath35 ( we do not add a quartic self - interaction for the scalar field ; such an interaction will not qualitatively change our results . ) scalar one - boson exchange is attractive , therefore , we expect the formation of cooper pairs at finite density and sufficiently low temperature in the @xmath34 channel",
    ". since the fermions in the lagrangian ( [ l ] ) are not charged , this model can only exhibit superfluidity , not superconductivity .",
    "nevertheless , the dirac structure of the superfluid condensate is closely analogous to that of the color - superconducting condensate in qcd .",
    "our principal result is the following .",
    "massless fermions have four types of @xmath34 condensates , corresponding to the pairing of fermions with the same helicity and chirality @xcite . for fermions interacting via yukawa interactions as in ( [ l ] ) , the gap for right - handed , positive helicity quasiparticles is equal in magnitude ( and opposite in sign ) to that for left - handed , negative helicity quasiparticles .",
    "a novel feature of the relativistic treatment is the appearance of gaps for quasi - antiparticles . with yukawa interactions ,",
    "we find that the gap for right - handed , negative helicity quasi - antiparticles is equal in magnitude to that for left - handed , positive helicity quasi - antiparticles .",
    "these relations between the right- and left - handed gaps imply that there is condensation only in the @xmath36 channel . for @xmath37 ,",
    "the quasiparticle and quasi - antiparticle gaps are not equal .    in the limit",
    "@xmath38 , the model ( [ l ] ) reduces to an njl - type model , and the quasiparticle and quasi - antiparticle gaps become degenerate .",
    "thus njl - type models are unrealistic , in that they force the equality of the quasiparticle and quasi - antiparticle gaps .",
    "the number of condensates is not merely a technical matter , but can even affect the order of a superconducting phase transition . consider the transition where up and down quarks condense to a color - superconducting phase .",
    "in @xcite we demonstrated that if only one condensate appears , such as that for particles , the transition is in the universality class of a single @xmath39 vector and can be of second order .",
    "based on the analysis of this paper , it seems unavoidable that condensates for both particles and antiparticles appear together .",
    "the universality class becomes that of two @xmath39 vectors ; while the fixed - point structure of this model is unknown , it might be driven first order by the coleman ",
    "weinberg phenomenon .",
    "if true , it implies that for two degenerate flavors , the color - superconducting transition is of first order , independent of the chiral transition @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we also showed that the transition where up and down quarks condense with strange quarks is driven first order by the coleman ",
    "weinberg mechanism .",
    "schfer and wilczek argued that the degrees of freedom in quark and hadron matter match at nonzero @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "their observation implies that this line of first order transitions , which starts at zero temperature , could terminate at some nonzero temperature , similar to the liquid - gas transition in water or nuclear matter .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we compute the full fermion propagator and discuss the excitation spectrum in a superfluid .",
    "then , the gap equations are derived in the mean - field approximation for the model ( [ l ] ) .",

    "we study solutions of the gap equations as a function of the coupling @xmath41 and the renormalization scale @xmath40 .",
    "we also analyze the temperature dependence of the gap energy and discuss the critical temperature @xmath10 , at which superfluidity vanishes .",
