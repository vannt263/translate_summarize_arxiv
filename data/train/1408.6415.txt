    "to pin down the isospin - dependent term of the equation of state ( eos ) of neutron - rich nucleonic matter , i.e. , the density @xmath0 dependence of nuclear symmetry energy @xmath1 , is a common goal of many studies in both nuclear physics and astrophysics , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent and comprehensive review . to achieve this goal , it is important to know more about the origin of the symmetry energy . the symmetry energy has kinetic and potential parts . in many studies ,",
    "the kinetic symmetry energy is normally approximated by a free fermi gas model prediction @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the fermi energy at density @xmath0 .",
    "however , this approximation was recently found to be invalid when effects of the isospin - dependent short - range nucleon - nucleon correlations are considered . in particular ,",
    "it was shown in both phenomenological models @xcite and microscopic many - body theories @xcite that the short - range correlation ( src ) due to the tensor force acting predominately between a spin - triplet , isospin - singlet neutron - proton pair reduce significantly the kinetic symmetry energy to even negative values at saturation density @xmath4 . moreover ,",
    "circumstantial evidence supporting this prediction was recently found from analyzing both ( e , e@xmath5 ) scattering @xcite and heavy - ion collision experiments @xcite .",
    "since the total symmetry energy at @xmath4 is relatively well determined to be around a global average of @xmath6 mev @xcite , the magnitude of the potential symmetry energy at @xmath4 has to be enhanced proportionally .",
    "we notice that in situations where only the total symmetry energy matters , such as , the extraction of symmetry energy and its density slope from analyzing atomic masses , @xmath7 and @xmath8 decay energies , isobaric analog states and the isoscaling parameters , how the @xmath9 is divided into its kinetic and potential parts has no observable effect .",
    "however , it matters in dynamical models where the symmetry potential is a direct input .",
    "for example , in transport model simulations of heavy - ion collisions , the symmetry potential corresponding to a given potential symmetry energy is a direct input .",
    "on the other hand , the kinetic symmetry energy does not directly enter transport model simulations but limits the magnitude of the potential symmetry energy through the sum rule @xmath10 .",
    "the enhanced ( reduced ) potential ( kinetic ) symmetry energy is expected to affect the significance of the isospin degree of freedom in heavy - ion collisions . while extensive studies of the potential symmetry energy over a broad density range using heavy - ion experiments have been carried out , information about the kinetic symmetry energy at @xmath4 from @xmath11 scattering experiments just started appearing @xcite .",
    "of course , they are complementary to each other and a complete determination of the density dependence of nuclear symmetry requires better knowledge of both kinetic and potential symmetry energies . in this work , within the ibuu transport model @xcite",
    "we examine quantitatively how the role of isospin degree of freedom might be increased by the enhanced ( reduced ) potential ( kinetic ) symmetry energy in heavy - ion collisions at intermediate energies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we shall first examine how the existing constraints on the magnitude and slope of the @xmath1 at @xmath4 may limit its division into kinetic and potential parts .",
    "then , within the ibuu transport model using the option of a momentum - independent potential we examine effects of a reduced ( enhanced ) kinetic ( potential ) symmetry energy on ( 1 ) the time evolution of the neutron / proton ratio in both the gas ( @xmath12 ) and liquid ( @xmath13 ) regions , ( 2 ) the free neutron / proton ratio as a function of nucleon kinetic energy and their beam energy dependence , ( 3 ) the mid - rapidity neutron / proton ratio as a function of transverse momentum , and ( 4 ) the time evolution of the @xmath14 ratio in heavy - ion collisions near the pion production threshold .",
    "finally , we summarize .",
    "the allowed region of the @xmath15 plane corresponding approximately to the lower and upper limits of the constraints on the @xmath16 correlation shown in the inset . ]     the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy with various combinations of the @xmath15 values in comparison with the experimental constraints in the subsaturation density region @xcite . ]",
    "significant progress has been made recently in constraining the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy around @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "however , the available constraints do not constrain individually the kinetic and potential parts of the symmetry energy .",
    "in fact , with the exception of dynamical observables in nuclear reactions , only the total symmetry energy is extracted from model analyses of experimental data . assuming the kinetic part is the one given in eq .",
    "[ fg ] , the potential part @xmath17 normally contains one or more parameters with its strength limited by the condition @xmath18 mev at @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , the correlated fermi gas model @xcite and the microscopic many - body theories  @xcite have all indicated consistently that the src reduces the magnitude significantly but affects very little the slope @xmath19 of the kinetic symmetry energy with respect to the free fermi gas model prediction .",
    "it is thus reasonable to parameterize the symmetry energy as @xmath20(\\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_0})^{\\gamma}\\ ] ] using two parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 to vary its kinetic and potential part , respectively .",
    "the corresponding @xmath23 is @xmath24    at least 30 different analyses so far have attempted to constrain the @xmath16 correlation using various data from both terrestrial nuclear laboratory experiments and astrophysical observations . shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] are two examples from analyzing atomic masses @xcite and the dipole polarizability of @xmath25pb @xcite . given a set of @xmath9 and @xmath23 , a correlation between @xmath21 and @xmath22 can be obtained from eq .",
    "[ ll ] . shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] are boundaries in the @xmath15 plane between two extremes with @xmath26 mev and @xmath27 on the left and @xmath28 mev and @xmath29 mev on the right .",
    "it is seen that widely diverse combinations of @xmath21 and @xmath22 are allowed by the existing constraints on the @xmath16 correlation . in particular , it is interesting to note from examining eq . [ ll ] that if @xmath30 , then @xmath31 independent of @xmath21 , namely any value of @xmath21 is allowed when both the kinetic and potential parts vary with @xmath32 .",
    "probably incidentally , 28 analyses of various terrestrial and astrophysical data led to the global mean values of @xmath33 mev and @xmath34 mev @xcite satisfying approximately the @xmath31 relation .",
    "thus , the currently existing constraints on the @xmath16 correlation does not limit even loosely the value of @xmath21 , namely the kinetic symmetry energy essentially can be anything",
    ".    the range of the allowed @xmath15 combinations can also be examined by comparing the symmetry energy parameterized in eq .",
    "[ esym ] with its existing constraint in the subsaturaion density region @xcite . as an example , shown in fig .",
    "2 is such a comparison with @xmath35 mev .",
    "it is seen that for a given @xmath22 , depending on whether it is smaller or larger than @xmath36 , the symmetry energy becomes softer or stiffer by reducing the value of @xmath21 ( kinetic symmetry energy ) . for @xmath35 mev",
    ", @xmath21 can be as small as zero . by varying the value of @xmath9 between 25 and 36 mev covering the whole range currently used in the literature , we find that even negative kinetic symmetry energy is allowed , consistent with the information shown in fig.1 and predictions in refs .   @xcite . from fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] , we also notice that the stiffness of the symmetry energy at suprasaturation densities is affected appreciably by both the @xmath21 and @xmath22 parameters , i.e. , both the kinetic and potential parts of the symmetry energy .",
    "the @xmath1 parameterized in eq .",
    "[ esym ] can be used directly to understand some experimental observables within statistical models when the thermal and chemical equilibrium have been reached . however , in heavy - ion collisions thermal equilibrium normally happens at the so - called freeze - out density below @xmath4 . to extract nuclear symmetry energy at supra - saturation densities from heavy - ion collisions",
    "one has to use dynamical observables and understand well the role of the isospin degree of freedom during the reaction .",
    "this has been shown to be a very challenging task .",
    "to go one step further and get information about the separate kinetic and potential parts of the symmetry energy is much more difficult . how to explicitly incorporate properly src effects from the initialization of nucleons in phase space , to the in - medium elementary nucleon - nucleon collisions and the off - shell propagation of high - momentum nucleons during heavy - ion collisions is a complex problem on the agenda of our future work .",
    "in this exploratory study , we address a relatively simple question ,",
    "namely , under the condition that the symmetry energy @xmath9 at saturation density is fixed , how does the enhanced ( reduced ) potential ( kinetic ) symmetry energy affect the isospin dynamics and isovector observables in heavy - ion collisions ? the key to answer this question is the nucleon symmetry potential . without considering the momentum dependence , the symmetry potential corresponding to the symmetry energy of eq .",
    "[ esym ] is @xmath37\\cdot(\\rho/\\rho_0)^{\\gamma } \\cdot[\\pm 2\\delta+(\\gamma-1)\\delta^2]\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the isospin asymmetry of the medium .",
    "we notice that the @xmath39 term dominates and the @xmath40 sign is for @xmath41 , namely , neutrons ( protons ) feel repulsive ( attractive ) symmetry potentials . basically , the @xmath21 and @xmath22 control respectively the magnitude and density dependence of the symmetry potential . while numerically varying",
    "the @xmath21 is equivalent to varying the @xmath9 as in some previous studies in the literature , they are conceptually different and have different consequences .",
    "we emphasize again that in our approach the @xmath9 is fixed at a value consistent with the existing experimental constraints by varying simultaneously and self - consistently the kinetic and potential parts of the symmetry energy in the opposite direction .",
    "the reaction dynamics is determined by the nuclear force , i.e. , the density gradient of the potential , thus both the @xmath21 and @xmath22 parameters affect the isospin dynamics . with @xmath42 , the eq .",

    "as one expects , the free neutron / proton ratio depends on both the @xmath21 and @xmath22 parameters .",

    "some experimental consequences are discussed . in particular , the evolution of the neutron / proton and @xmath14 ratio as well as the kinetic energy and transverse momentum dependence of the free neutron / proton ratio at the freeze - out of heavy - ion collisions are all strongly affected by the reduced kinetic symmetry energy due to the short - range nucleon - nucleon correlation .",
    "we would like to re - emphasize that the main purpose of this exploratory work is to get a qualitatively understanding of the effects of the src reduced kinetic symmetry energy in heavy - ion collisions . as we mentioned earlier , a lot more work needs to be done to draw a strong conclusion from comparing with data quantitatively . in particular , to incorporate consistently src effects in the initialization of colliding nuclei , off - shell propagation of high - momentum nucleons and the momentum - dependence of the symmetry potential in transport models remains an interesting challenge .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth noting that current indications for a reduced kinetic symmetry energy are strong .",
    "for example , without considering the src reduced kinetic symmetry energy , ibuu calculations @xcite fall far below the nscl / msu data on the free neutron / proton double ratio from central @xmath44sn+@xmath44sn and @xmath43sn+@xmath43sn collisions at 50 and 120 mev / u  @xcite .",
    "this failure calls for new mechanisms to enhance the double neutron / proton ratio .",
    "interestingly , with all the cautions mentioned above , calculations using the same model as in the present work can well reproduce the nscl / msu data @xcite .",
    "in fact , by performing the @xmath60 fit to the nscl / msu data in the @xmath15 parameter plane , we found that the best combination is @xmath61 and @xmath62 , corresponding to a kinetic symmetry energy of @xmath63 mev at @xmath4 @xcite .",
