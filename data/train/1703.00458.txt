    "alternatively , instabilities leading to clumps could be driven by interactions with other galaxies in which gas rich interactions maintain a disk@xcite .",

    "theory predicts that non - axisymmetric instabilities occur in locations where @xmath80 is a decreasing function of radius .",
    "no such preference is seen in our data .",
    "[ fig : fvort ] , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    if the primary formation mechanism of massive clumps were the compression of gas in extremely gas rich major - mergers there is no clear reason for the relationships in fig .",

    "for the same average relative clump size dynamo merging galaxies ( h10 - 2 and g13 - 1 ) are more dispersion dominated than the turbulent disks .",

    "though beyond the scope of this work , a comparison of simulation results would be helpful .    a clump with energy , @xmath84 , will loose energy as it radially decays .",
    "this energy is translated to an increase in disk velocity dispersion , @xmath18 . using the average position of clumps in clumpy dynamo disks ( 2.7  kpc ) , the average size of disks in the same galaxies ( 5  kpc ) , and assuming @xmath85 , one derives @xmath86 .",

    "@xcite shows that the larger number of clumps compared to @xmath93 observations is likely a resolution effect .",
    "it seems unlikely that each clump represents a minor merger within the past @xmath51  gyr .",
    "moreover , the local gravity and shear are very likely to alter the structure of a clump initiating from a minor merger .",
    "an alternate possibility is that clumps resulting from minor mergers reshape to match the stability conditions derived in eq .",

    "ultimately a measurement of clump properties in figs .",
    "[ fig : cors ] and [ fig : qclump ] derived from minor mergers in simulations with realistic conditions would be useful .    to zeroth order ,",
    "if all clumps result from minor - mergers there should be no dependence of @xmath61 on galactocentric radius .",
    "conversely , in the disk - instability model @xmath55 should decrease with radius , until @xmath94 flattens , and therefore @xmath61 would decrease with galactic radius . in dynamo",
    "we find that clumps located in the central 20% of the disk have a median clump size of @xmath95 , where as the median of the rest of the disk is @xmath96 .",
    "yet another possible mechanism driving clump formation are non - axisymmetric instabilities@xcite .",
    "these instabilities do not require low @xmath1 , and thus it seems unlikely that we would observe such regularity in fig .",
    "[ fig : cors ] in this case .",
    "the main criterion for non - axisymmetric instabilities is that the _ potential vorticity _ be a decreasing function of radius . for rotating disk galaxies potential vorticity , @xmath80 ,",
    "is defined as @xmath97 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fvort ] we plot profiles of @xmath80 for all dynamo galaxies that contain large clumps ( @xmath98% ) .",

    ", there is clearly no preferential relationship between clump locations and @xmath99f , suggesting non - axisymmetric instabilities are not likely driving clump formation .",
    "in this letter we report the observation of positive , linear correlations between the average , normalized size of clumps ( @xmath61 ) in turbulent disks with both the ratio of velocity dispersion - to - rotation speed ( @xmath55 ) of the disk and the gas fraction ( @xmath60 ) of the disk . these correlations in our data ( fig .",
