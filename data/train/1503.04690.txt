    "in recent years , organic nanofibers have gained a broad fundamental and industrial interest , due to their peculiar physical properties and to their numerous potential applications , such as tissue engineering , air and water filtration , drug delivery and regenerative medicine .",
    "flexible fibers can be used on a micro- down to nano - scale in electrical , mechanical and optical systems . in particular",
    ", the small cross - section of electrospun nanofibers in combination with their extreme length ( in principle up to km when polymer solutions with high degree of molecular entanglement are used ) provides a high surface - area ratio which offers intriguing perspectives for practical applications . as a consequence ,",
    "several studies have been focused on the characterization and production of such one - dimensional ( 1d ) organic nanostructures .",
    "many articles @xcite and books @xcite concerning the production of electrospun nanofibers and the investigation of the phenomenology of electrified jets have been published in the last two decades .    following the pioneering works of rayleigh @xcite and , later , zeleny @xcite ,",
    "electrospun nanofibers are synthesized by the uniaxial elongation of a polymer solution jet , which is ejected at a nozzle from the surface of a charged droplet ( see fig [ fig : schema - esperimento ] ) .",
    "this elongation of the fluid body is obtained by means of an intense , external electrostatic field @xcite ( typically @xmath0 ) which generates a voltage bias between the nozzle ( spinneret ) and a conductive collector . during the jet path from the nozzle to the collector ,",
    "the stream cross - section can decrease up to six orders of magnitude , providing a jet , and consequently solid fibers , with transversal size well below the micrometer - scale . in a typical electrospinning ( es )",
    "process the uniaxial elongation of the extruded polymer jet involves mainly two sequential stages : 1 ) an initial quasi - steady stage , in which the jet is stretched in a straight path ; 2 ) a second stage in which relevant bending instabilities might occur , induced by small perturbations and leading to a jet trajectory spiralling out from the pristine axis of elongation . the perturbations initiating bending instabilities can be related to mechanical vibrations , as well as to hydrodynamic - aerodynamic solicitations along the jet path . according to the earnshaw s theorem @xcite , an off - axis misalignment provides an electrostatic - driven bending instability before the jet reaches the conductive collector , where the fibers are finally deposited . as a consequence , the length of the trajectory of the jet increases , and the cross - sectional size of the elongated fluid body ( and of the ultimately deposited nanofibers ) undergoes a corresponding further decrease . for these reasons , the design of electrospinning experiments in which the length of the initial , uniaxial elongation region of the jet is minimized ,",
    "can be highly desired when nanofibers with very small diameters are to be produced with a given polymer .",
    "notwithstanding its major interest , a comprehensive investigation to understand the transition between different regimes of the jet dynamics is not complete , and the relation between dissipative - perturbing forces and the first quasi - steady stage of the es process is still in need of further clarification .",
    "in particular , an uniaxial dissipative - perturbing force , such as the air drag force , can reduce the length of the initial straight path , so that the overall distance covered by the jet between the spinneret and the collecting surface increases , and the stream cross - section is further decreased by subsequent instabilities as mentioned above .",
    "simulation models can be very useful to rationalize these phenomenona and to improve our capability of prediction of which processing parameters mostly affect the fiber morphology . in the last years , many studies were published in this respect @xcite .",
    "many of these works are based on the equations of continuum mechanics @xcite . in other studies ,",
    "the electrified jet is described as series of discrete elements obeying the equations of newtonian mechanics @xcite , as in our work .    here , the dynamics of an electrified polymer jet is investigated in its early - stage under a stationary dissipative - perturbing force , which is modeled by a simple brownian term .",
    "such brownian noise can efficiently model the stationary perturbation due to many , simultaneously occurring and tiny impacts along the pristine stretching direction , as those related to air drag forces affecting the dynamics of the jet while it moves through a gaseous medium",
    ". such assumption was already proposed on the base of reported experiments @xcite . in the present study",
    ", we include a dissipative - perturbing force to the one - dimensional bead - spring model , developed by pontrelli _",
    "@xcite , in order to model the effects of the air drag force .",
    "this is accomplished by adding two force terms to the set of equations of motion ( eom ) : a random term and a dissipative term .",
    "these two components of the overall forces obey the fluctuation - dissipation langevin relation @xcite , hence the electrified jet is described by a langevin - like stochastic differential equation .",
    "anticipating the conclusions , we observe that a second quasi steady stage appears by applying different magnitude of dissipative - perturbing force .",
    "further , the proposed approach provides a useful starting point to develop stochastic three - dimensional models of es processes .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we present our model for the uniaxial elongation of a viscoelastic jet , and we introduce the corresponding set of stochastic eom , which governs the dynamics of system . hence , the time integrator of the stochastic eom is also reported in sec .",
    "results are reported and discussed in sec .",
    "finally , the conclusions are outlined in sec .",
    "we describe a rectilinear jet in the es experiment by a viscoelastic dumbbell , @xmath1 , with two charged beads of mass @xmath2 , at distance @xmath3 and having the same charge @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schema - esperimento ] ) .",
    "we assume one of the two beads to be fixed , denoted by symbol @xmath5 , and the other , denoted by @xmath6 , is free to move .",
    "a viscoelastic force pulls @xmath6 back to @xmath5 .",
    "the collector surface is at a distance @xmath7 from the spinneret ( bead injection point ) , and a voltage bias @xmath8 is applied between the two elements .",
    "the bead @xmath6 is subject to the force due to the external electrical field @xmath9 , to the coulomb repulsive force between the two beads , and to the dumbbell viscoelastic force . anticipating the results in sec .",
    "4 , in this scheme electrostatics and viscoelasticity compete and determine the first stage of the elongation process , whereas the second stage of the jet path is mainly governed by the external electrical field .",
    "overall , the time evolution of the viscoelastic fluid body can be properly described by the following ordinary differential equations as proposed by reneker _ _ et .",

    "the dimensionless groups are given by :    @xmath31    a reminder for the definitions of the dimensionless parameters is reported in table 1 .",
    "we now extend this model to include air drag effects on the jet dynamics , adding two further force terms to eq .",
    "[ eq : ode]c .",
    "we indicate as @xmath32 a generic diffusion coefficient in the velocity space and as @xmath33 a dissipative term , and we assume that a dissipative force term is present , with form @xmath34 .",
    "in addition , a random force component is considered , which reads @xmath35 , where @xmath36 describes a stochastic process that is nowhere differentiable with @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "note that the dissipative term @xmath34 is usually dependent on the geometry of the jet , which changes in time .",
    "in particular , based on experimental results , the dissipative air drag force was proposed equal to @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the air density and kinematic viscosity , respectively@xcite . assuming a constant volume of the jet , so that @xmath42 , we obtain @xmath43 , provided that the air drag force is depending on the jet length factor @xmath44 . in this work",
    "we assume that @xmath33 is not @xmath3-dependent , supported by the fact that , in the initial stage of the elongation process , the jet length does not change dramatically . for simplicity , we also model the dissipative force as a term which increases linearly with @xmath45 instead of @xmath46 , thus obtaining a simple langevin - like stochastic model obeying to the fluctuation - dissipation langevin relation .",
    "thus , adding the two dissipative and randomic force terms in eq .",
    "[ eq : vel - ode ] , we obtain :    @xmath47    in order to be consistent with the adopted description , we introduce :    @xmath48    which are the dimensionless counterparts of @xmath33 and @xmath32 . using these definitions and the dimensionless groups , we rewrite the eq .",
    "[ eq : sde - dimen ] as :    @xmath49    we highlight that @xmath50 sets the width of the fluctuations .",
    "in particular , it is possible to demonstrate @xcite that the variance @xmath51 of the velocity @xmath52 due to only the random and dissipative terms at time @xmath12 , computed over an ensemble of stochastic trajectories , is equal to @xmath53@xmath54^{2}>$ ] @xmath55 , and , consequently , @xmath56 , which is sometimes called fluctuation - dissipation langevin relation .    in order to integrate the differential eom we discretize @xmath12 as @xmath57 with @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes the number of sub - intervals . in this work",
    "we adopt the explicit strong order scheme by platen @xcite , whereof the order of strong convergence was evaluated equal to 1.5 .",
    "it is worth to note that for the specific case under investigation the diffusion coefficient vector has only one non - zero component equal to @xmath50 , which is constant . as consequence",
    ", the original integration scheme considerably simplifies .",
    "this scheme avoids the use of derivatives by corresponding finite differences in the same way as runge - kutta schemes do for odes in a deterministic setting , and it is briefly summarized as follows .",

    "in the case @xmath75 and @xmath76 , eq . [ eq : sde ] reduces to eq .",
    "[ eq : ode].c .",
    "consequently , the integration scheme described by eq .",
    "[ eq : integrator - platen ] can be used also to integrate eqs .",
    "[ eq : ode ] for the deterministic case .",
    "we exploited in preliminary test the time reversibility to assess a suitable time step @xmath77 , which was found equal to @xmath78 in order to provide a precision lower than @xmath79 for the length @xmath80 .",
    "we study and comment on a few , metastable and asymptotic regimes of electrified jets , associated with the eq .",
    "[ eq : sde ] .",
    "we consider the typical values @xmath81 and @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "other parameters , related with experiments , are @xmath83 and @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "the deterministic system case can be described by choosing @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the simulations start with @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 . in fig",
    "[ fig : caso-1-l - w ] we report the time evolution of the velocity @xmath88 .",
    "two sequential stages are seen in the elongation dynamics ( point @xmath89 and @xmath90 in the figure ) .",
    "initially , a moderate increase is found for @xmath88 up to a quasi stationary point ( @xmath91 ) . at this point , corresponding to the lower limit of the derivative @xmath92 , the viscoelastic force @xmath93 equals the sum of @xmath94 and @xmath95 , thus zeroing the total force .",
    "then , in the second stage ( after @xmath91 ) the velocity trend comes to a nearly linearly - increasing regime , as expected by the relation @xmath96 .",
    "further , we show in fig [ fig : caso-1-l - w ] the time evolution of the length @xmath80 . we observe that @xmath80 increases as a quadratic term , since the limit of its second derivative is constant , @xmath97 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : caso-1-l - w ] we also report the three force terms @xmath98 , @xmath95 and @xmath99 . in the first stage",
    "we observe an early transient , characterized by the build - up of the term @xmath99 , which peaks around @xmath100 under the coulomb force @xmath98 and the external electric field @xmath95 . in the second stage , the term @xmath99 and @xmath98 start to decay , and the dynamics tends asymptotically to be governed only by the term @xmath95 .",
    "we point out that a smaller @xmath91 means a shorter straight path of the electrified jet , so that the overall length of the trajectory covered by the jet from the nozzle and to the collector increases , and the stream cross - section decreases correspondingly .",
    "we now investigate the jet elongation under stochastic perturbation .",
    "in particular , it is our interest to assess how @xmath91 is affected the dissipative - perturbing term @xmath101 in eq .",
    "[ eq : sde ] .",
    "we investigate different magnitudes of @xmath102 keeping the ratio @xmath103 constant .",
    "we stress that the magnitude of the parameters @xmath102 and @xmath103 is depending on the amplitude of the modeled perturbation .",
    "as example , let us consider the aforementioned experimental formula @xmath104 in order to assess a typical value of @xmath102 .",

    "the time dependent mean value of physical observables is then computed along the dynamics , and the statistical dispersion is evaluated as interquartile range ( iqr ) @xcite .",
    "all the trajectories are carried out at the reference values of @xmath81 and @xmath82 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : caso - stoc - v ] we show the time evolution of the velocity @xmath88 for three values of the friction coefficient @xmath102 .",
    "first of all , we note , in all the cases with @xmath114 the presence of two quasi - stationary points denoted @xmath91 and @xmath115 , instead of only one , like in the deterministic system . here",
    ", @xmath91 is the point of coordinates @xmath116 , where the system reaches the condition @xmath117 for the first time , and similarly @xmath115 is the point @xmath118 where the system reaches the condition @xmath117 for the second time .",
    "this second point @xmath115 is originated by the dissipation air drag term , which slows down the dynamics of the jet .",
    "this effecy is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshot - conf ] , where the jet dynamics in the presence and in the absence of the air drag force are compared .",
    "interestingly , since a slower dynamics makes the fluid body more exposed to bending instabilities , the air drag effect can likely increase the ultimate jet elongation and lead to a further reduction of the filament cross - section , which plays in favour of the transversal miniaturization of the finally collected nanofibers .",
    "we point out that , although the present 1d model is not able to describe bending instabilities , it represents a preliminary step for developing three - dimensional stochastic models of es processes .    by using the points @xmath91 and @xmath115",
    "we now define three sequential stages of the uniaxial elongation process ( denoted in figure [ fig : caso - stoc - v ] as _ a _ , _ b _ and c , respectively ) .    in order to analyze the different regimes , we examine the force terms reported in figure [",
    "fig : stoc - force ] for the case @xmath119 .",
    "first of all , we observe that the coulomb term @xmath98 decays rapidly , playing a secondary role .    the first stage _ a _ is characterized by the @xmath99 and @xmath120 terms , increasing due to jet stretching as induced by the external field @xmath95 .",
    "the combined action of the opposite forces produces the first quasi stationary point @xmath91 , where the terms @xmath99 and @xmath120 balance the term @xmath95 . in the second stage _",
    "b _ , the terms @xmath99 and @xmath120 become larger in modulus than the opposite electrostatic term ( @xmath95 ) , so that we observe a decrease of the velocity @xmath52 . at the same time , the term @xmath99 starts to decay , and the sum of the two terms @xmath99 and @xmath120 becomes insufficient to balance the opposite coulomb term @xmath95 . thus , we observe the second quasi stationary point @xmath115 .    in the third stage ,",
    "the jet dynamics is finally governed by the remaining opposite terms @xmath95 and @xmath120 , since the term @xmath99 tends to zero . as consequence ,",
    "the velocity @xmath52 rises again under the external electrical force @xmath95 , to achieve asymptotically a final stationary regime , where the dissipative force @xmath120 balances completely @xmath95 . in table",
    "[ tab : pqsvalues ] the values of @xmath91 and @xmath115 are summarized for all the three values of @xmath102 . we note that the gap between @xmath91 and @xmath115 becomes larger by increasing @xmath102 , and the path length through the second stage increases ( see figure [ fig : caso - stoc - v ] ) .",
    "note that the straight path of the electrified jet is described by the observable @xmath121 .",
    "we observe a decrease of the length @xmath121 upon increasing @xmath102 ( figure [ fig : caso - stoc - l ] ) , namely the length covered by the jet during its initial elongational stage is reduced due to the early uniaxial perturbation .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the linear langevin model employed in this work leads to an underestimate of the drag effect , which is generally reported to be mildly superlinear .",
    "even though this non - linearity may lead to significant effects on the long - term dynamics of the system , it is unlikely to affect the short - term one , which is the focus of the present paper .",
    "the non - linear friction is being studied in forthcoming work , and surely warrants a thorough investigation for the case of fully three - dimensional long - term dynamics .",
    "advantages for es processes coming from unveiling and characterizing these effects can be numerous , including the possibility of better controlling the dynamics of electrified jets .",
    "in particular , the diameter of collected nanostructures could be significantly reduced by exploiting air drag effects , which can increase the jet path by slowing down the dynamics of the process .",
    "electrified viscoelastic fluid bodies , as those typical of es experiments , were analyzed under conditions comprising stationary stochastic perturbations .",
    "a brownian term has been employed to model a stationary dissipative - perturbing force .",
    "the resulting effects on the jet stretching were investigated .",
    "the main finding is that perturbation forces , such as air drag force , change significantly the es dynamics , leading to the presence of a second quasi stationary point .",
    "further , we find that the jet linear extension in the early es stage decreases upon increasing dissipation . these conclusions may allow experimental conditions embedding increased dissipative components to be designed , which might enhance the efficiency of the es process and the capability to produce ultra - thin polymer fibers .",
    "examples of such conditions may include gas flows in the process atmosphere , and mechanical solicitations resulting in enhanced ambient vibrations .",
