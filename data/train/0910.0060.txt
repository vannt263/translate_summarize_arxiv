    "the dynamics of an open quantum system can be described by its scattering matrix .",
    "the scattering matrix is defined as the linear operator which transforms an incoming wavefunction , expanded in an asymptotic channel eigenmode basis , into the outgoing wavefunction .",
    "probability conservation forces the scattering matrix to be unitary .",
    "as the scattering matrix describes the system , it can be used to investigate the desired physical properties of the system .",
    "a quantity of particular interest is the wigner time delay @xcite which was first derived for the one channel case from a hermitian operator based on the scattering amplitude .",
    "the time delay is , as the name suggests , a measure of the extra time a particle spends inside the scattering region as a result of being scattered ( for some details see @xcite for example ) , and was later generalised to multi - channel scattering matrices @xcite . with @xmath0 scattering channels ,",
    "the hermitian operator admits @xmath0 eigenvalues which are the _ individual delay times _ of the system , and the _ wigner time delay _ is simply the average of these values .    for classically chaotic systems with a small opening",
    ", the probability for particles to remain inside the system decays exponentially with a typical time scale depending on the size of the opening .",
    "the exponential decay can be seen as a natural consequence of the ergodicity of the classical motion as ( for reasonable times ) the particle is equally likely to hit any part of the boundary of the system leading to a roughly constant small probability to leave through the opening each time it hits .",
    "the continuous limit of this process is the exponential decay , and the time scale associated to the decay is , for chaotic systems , exactly the average time delay @xcite of the corresponding quantum system .",
    "staying with the classical version for now , if we spread particles evenly over the available space and evolve them over time they will condense onto a typically fractal pattern arranged around the zero - measure set of trapped periodic orbits that never leave the system . from this set , and following their stable manifolds very closely we can construct trajectories that start outside the system , approach trapped orbits and remain inside the system for arbitrarily long times before eventually escaping following the unstable manifolds .",
    "in fact , it turns out that these trajectories , or rather correlations between them , are responsible in the semiclassical limit for recreating the oscillating part of the time delay @xcite , which is given exactly in terms of the trapped periodic orbits @xcite .    as the oscillating part of the time delay",
    "is given in terms of periodic orbits in the semiclassical limit ( of @xmath1 ) , correlations between periodic orbits must then be responsible for the typical fluctuations of the wigner time delay .",
    "in particular the form factor of the time delay can be written in terms of pairs of periodic orbits and the types of correlations that contribute were first treated for the spectral form factor for closed systems , where gutzwiller s trace formula @xcite likewise provides a sum over pairs of orbits .",
    "the semiclassical treatment of this sum started with the diagonal approximation @xcite of pairing orbits with themselves ( or their time reversal ) and used the sum rule of @xcite to find the semiclassical contribution .",
    "this was followed more recently by the treatment of correlated pairs of orbits which are almost identical everywhere , but which differ in a very small region called an encounter where the orbits behave differently and end up reconnecting inside the encounter @xcite .",
    "all the possible types of orbits with encounters were then generated and treated @xcite , and this treatment was applied to the time delay to obtain a semiclassical expansion for its form factor @xcite .",
    "the expansion for the form factor of the wigner time delay was shown to agree with the result from random matrix theory ( rmt ) , in line with the idea that most properties of quantum chaotic systems are well described by the results of rmt .",
    "but rmt can tell us at lot more about the expected typical behaviour of the individual delay times , and in particular that their distribution should have a compact support @xcite in the limit where the opening supports a large number of channels .",
    "of course the classical decay gives no upper bound on the distribution of the delay times , and so ( if we expect to recover rmt results ) quantum interference as expressed through semiclassical correlations between classical trajectories should somehow contrive to limit the maximum delay time .",
    "our aim in this article is to identify the sort of correlations that contribute in the semiclassical limit and to describe how they lead to the rmt result .",
    "we start with an introduction to the time delay in section  [ timedelay ] .",
    "to study the distribution of the delay times we evaluate their moments which can be expressed in terms of correlation functions of the scattering matrix .",
    "this approach simplifies the semiclassical treatment compared to the direct evaluation of the time delay matrix .    in section  [ rmtpredictions ]",
    "we briefly review the rmt results before applying the semiclassical approximation to the scattering matrix elements to obtain expressions in terms of scattering trajectories .",
    "for the low order moments , which we treat in section  [ firstmoments ] , we build on the work of the semiclassical treatment of the conductance @xcite and its second moment @xcite . to treat all the moments , we delve into the combinatorial relations that first arose in the treatment of the moments of the transmission amplitudes @xcite .",
    "this work is extended in section  [ allmoments ] , where we find an implicit expression for the generating function of the moments and show complete agreement with the rmt distribution of delay times . considering a simpler case in  [ sec : c_all_orders ]",
    ", we briefly derive the correlation functions which recently appeared in the semiclassical treatment of the density of states of andreev billiards @xcite .",
    "if we consider a chaotic cavity with one or more open leads that carry @xmath0 scattering channels , the scattering dynamics is encoded in the @xmath2 unitary scattering matrix @xmath3 which relates the incoming and outgoing waves .",
    "we are interested in the wigner time delay , which represents the extra time spent in the scattering process compared to free motion , and which can be found using the wigner - smith matrix @xcite @xmath4 differentiating the unitarity condition , @xmath5 , with respect to @xmath6 , we see that @xmath7 and that the matrix @xmath8 is hermitian with real eigenvalues .",

    "this correlation function provides a symmetrized version of the time delay @xcite @xmath14 , \\ ] ] which agrees with the definition in because of the unitarity of the scattering matrix as expressed through .    as well as giving us the first moment of the delay times ( the wigner time delay ) , this correlation function can also provide us with the second .",

    "further can not produce higher moments since the @xmath20-th moment involves the first derivative of @xmath3 appearing @xmath20 times while the definition of @xmath16 , see  , involves only two matrices .",

    "we can obtain all the moments up to the @xmath23-th by differentiating .",
    "the formulae , which are different for odd and even moments , are @xmath24    though this provides an efficient way to calculate the lower order moments , the different energy arguments complicate the semiclassical treatment . on the other hand , setting all energy arguments to @xmath25 and differentiating @xmath20 times",
    "leads to appearance of additional unwanted terms . to deal with such terms",

    "however , we found that performing the summation in is a difficult task .",
    "thus from now on we will work with @xmath32 directly .",
    "however , the technique we develop for evaluating @xmath32 is suitable for the simpler function @xmath31 as well .",
    "we exploit it by deriving an equation for the generating function of @xmath31 in [ sec : c_all_orders ] .",
    "finally , we note that one can use the semiclassical approximation directly in the definition of the wigner - smith matrix , equation  ( [ eq : q_def ] ) .",
    "the approach we took , however , allows us to build on previous semiclassical work performed in open systems , in particular on the average conductance of a chaotic ballistic device and its moments @xcite .",
    "we will obtain , as in the case of the conductance and shot noise , simple diagrammatic rules for the semiclassical contributions of correlated trajectories .",
    "but before approaching this task we will quickly review the rmt results for the delay times .",
    "the random matrix result for the probability distribution of the delay times is @xcite @xmath33 from which we can calculate the moments @xmath34 substituting @xmath35 this can be written more obviously in terms of the moments of the semicircle distribution @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "the odd moments of the semicircle distribution are 0 , while the even moments can be written as @xmath38 where @xmath39 are the catalan numbers defined as @xmath40 by expanding the term @xmath41 in in powers of @xmath42 , we can therefore express the moments ( beyond the first ) by the following sums @xmath43 the sequence of integers obtained from combining the catalan numbers as above , and hence appearing in the moments , can then be shown @xcite to be the so - called schrder numbers ( sloane s a006318 or 2@xmath44a001003 ) @xcite . more importantly for our purposes , the schrder numbers can be derived from a generating function @xcite and so the moments of the delay times can also be generated from @xmath45",

    "after semiclassical approximation , the correlation function @xmath61 becomes @xmath62 which is a sum over trajectory pairs @xmath63 both of which start and end in the same channels ( @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively ) , followed by a sum over all the possible channels .",
    "we note that the difference of actions @xmath66 is divided by @xmath67 and therefore the resulting phase oscillates wildly unless the action difference is of order @xmath68 .",
    "the semiclassical expansion is based on identifying couples ( or , more generally , families ) of orbits that have small action differences .    to leading order in inverse",

    "the diagonal approximation thus gives @xmath75 where we have used the fact that @xmath76 to simplify .",
    "substituting into we obtain @xmath77 which just states that the average delay time is the inverse of the classical escape rate as we might expect .      to obtain the next moment we move to the correlation function @xmath78 . for this",
    "we will need to treat not only the diagonal pairs , but also correlated trajectories that have encounters .",
    "the calculation follows the calculation of the shot noise power @xcite which was first performed to leading order in inverse channel number for quantum graphs @xcite .",
    "the semiclassical treatment of the shot noise builds on work on the conductance @xcite , which itself is built on the work on spectral statistics @xcite .",
    "first we slightly modify ( [ eq : d_trace_exp ] ) to explicitly include an indication of the unitarity of @xmath79 @xmath80 while the semiclassical approximation ( [ scatmateqn ] ) preserves the unitarity of @xmath79 , and thus the kronecker deltas are not necessary , their inclusion greatly facilitates the derivation .",
    "we now write down the semiclassical expression for the correlation function @xmath78 in terms of open trajectories @xmath81 for diagonal terms we can either pair @xmath82 and @xmath83 , or @xmath84 and @xmath85 . for the first case , the start channels @xmath64 and @xmath86 must coincide thus triggering the kronecker delta . for the second case we have @xmath87 .",
    "either case leads to a ( leading order ) channel factor of @xmath88 , because the number of channels we can choose in the outer summation is 3 .",
    "putting these two possibilities into ( [ eq : d2traj ] ) we can write the diagonal contribution as @xmath89 note that in the second case it can also happen that @xmath90 , but this case gives a lower order channel factor of @xmath91 and is therefore neglected . using the open sum rule from we get @xmath92 however , as we know from the calculation of the shot noise @xcite , the diagonal terms are not the only ones that contribute to leading order in inverse channel number . if the trajectories @xmath51 and @xmath93 come very close to each other in an encounter , as in figure  [ trajectoryquad ] , then the partner trajectories can cross over inside the encounter leading to a quadruplet of trajectories with a small action difference .",
    "such a quadruplet can then give a contribution in the semiclassical limit .",
    "while such an encounter makes the contribution higher order in inverse channel number , the sum over channels now contributes the factor of @xmath94 . as a result the quadruplet contributes at the same order as the diagonal terms .        to calculate the contribution",
    ", we simply put the additional energy arguments into the calculation of the shot noise power .",
    "the contribution can be separated into a product over the links and the encounters @xcite and written as @xmath95 where @xmath96 refers to the structure of the diagram : one encounter with two ( unprimed ) trajectories meeting ( a `` 2-encounter '' ) . in the final integral ,",
    "@xmath97 and @xmath98 are the separations along the stable and unstable manifolds of the two original stretches inside the encounter and @xmath99 is the volume of the available phase space , while @xmath100 is the duration of the encounter .",
    "an important point is that although the encounter involves two trajectory stretches , as they are close to each other they will either remain inside the system or escape together and their average survival probability is given by the time of just a single stretch .",
    "the presence of the encounter actually slightly enhances the survival probability of the whole trajectory quadruplet , and this tiny classical effect has important semiclassical implications . elsewhere in ,",
    "the @xmath101 are the durations of the link stretches as depicted in figure  [ trajectoryquad ] .",
    "performing the integrals following @xcite , we obtain the result @xmath102 the structure of the answer is very simple : each @xmath103-encounter contributes a factor of @xmath104 , while each link stretch gives the factor @xmath105 . these diagrammatic rules , which first arose for the conductance @xcite , massively simplify calculating the semiclassical contributions , and are the reason we consider correlation functions rather than the time delay directly .",
    "we can combine the two leading order results from and to obtain the second moment @xmath106 in conclusion of this subsection we mention that the configurations described as diagonal contributions above can be obtained from the diagram in figure  [ trajectoryquad ] by setting @xmath107 for the first case and @xmath108 for the second .",
    "we will refer to this reduction as moving or sliding an encounter into the lead . as we have seen above ,",
    "moving an encounter into the input lead can lead to a contribution that is different from the encounter in the output lead .      before we proceed to calculate @xmath109",
    ", we will briefly look at how we can form the diagrams that contribute .",
    "as we have seen , the @xmath20-th correlator is expressed as a sum over @xmath110 trajectories @xmath111 taking the trace of the product of matrices means that we identify @xmath112 .",
    "therefore the trajectories complete a cycle , if we consider moving forward along the unprimed trajectories and back along the primed ones .",
    "the resulting structure for @xmath113 is shown in figure  [ ceps3fig]a and , as we have also seen , in we add the actions of the unprimed trajectories and subtract the actions of the primed ones , so the resulting phase oscillates wildly unless the total action difference is of the order of @xmath68 .",
    "to obtain such a small action difference we can collapse all the trajectories onto each other , as in figure  [ ceps3fig]b , creating encounters of the type we saw in figure  [ trajectoryquad ] .",
    "it turns out that to obtain all contributions from this type of direct collapse we need to cyclically permute the labels of the trajectories , resulting in three copies of the diagram in figure  [ ceps3fig]b . alongside this direct collapse we can imagine sliding the encounters together to create a single diagram with a single 3-encounter , as shown in figure  [ ceps3fig]c .",
    "further possibilities then arise from sliding the encounters into the leads , giving the remaining diagrams depicted in figure  [ ceps3fig ] .     in a )",
    "can be collapsed down to ( three copies ) of the structure in b ) , which has two 2-encounters , to ensure a small action difference .",
    "sliding the encounters together creates the single 3-encounter in c ) , while moving encounters into the leads generates all the further possibilities .",
    "trajectories @xmath114 are indicated by solid lines and trajectories @xmath115 by dashed lines.,width=453 ]    before we write down the total contribution , we consider two instructive examples .",
    "first we evaluate the contribution from the diagram in figure  [ ceps3fig]e .",
    "we assume the trajectories indicated by solid lines are numbered top to bottom as @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "then we have @xmath90 since the first encounter is in the incoming lead .",
    "this activates one of the kronecker deltas in the expression for @xmath109 ( see or the similar expression in ) .",
    "the terms due to trajectories @xmath117 and @xmath118 , which have a non - degenerate encounter , are the same as in , giving in total @xmath119 where @xmath120 refers to the duration of @xmath121-th part of trajectory @xmath51 and the power of @xmath0 came from the 5 choices of the remaining channels .",
    "evaluating the integrals we get @xmath122 if on the other hand , we consider the contribution of the diagram in figure  [ ceps3fig]g , we notice that @xmath123 , thus activating three kronecker deltas .",
    "the contribution of this diagram is thus @xmath124 comparing the results in , and we can surmise that the power of @xmath125 that results from sliding an encounter into the incoming lead is equal to the number of _ direct _ stretches from the encounter to the outgoing lead , i.e.  the stretches that do not participate in any other encounters . this observation can be mathematically verified by using the relationship between diagrams and factorisations of the cyclic permutation @xcite .",
    "to summarise , we can write down the contribution of each diagram by simply looking at its links and encounters and assigning    * a factor of @xmath126 to each stretch , * a factor of @xmath127 to each non - degenerate @xmath103-encounter , * a factor of @xmath128 to each encounter happening in the incoming lead and having @xmath97 _ direct _ stretches to the outgoing lead . * a factor of 1 to each encounter happening in the outgoing lead .    altogether , the leading contribution to @xmath109 is thus @xmath129 where the factor of three counts the three different ways to label the diagram of figure  [ ceps3fig]b and its descendants .",
    "the third moment can thus be calculated to be @xmath130 and we note that if we put in three different energy arguments in line with , we can use the same diagrams to get the next three moments using and as @xmath131",
    "-tree . ]    now that we know the rules which govern the contributions of individual diagrams , we can look at generating all the diagrams and their contributions recursively . to leading order in inverse channel number , the contributing diagrams of the type @xmath132 are in a bijective correspondence with rooted plane trees @xcite that have @xmath133 vertices of degree @xmath134 and",
    "all other vertices of degree one ( called `` leaves '' ) , see figure  [ fig : tree_example ] .",
    "we denote by @xmath135 the total number of vertices of degree higher than 1 .",
    "these vertices correspond to encounters in the diagram .",
    "the total number of leaves can easily be seen to be @xmath136 , where @xmath137 .",
    "starting from the root the leaves are labelled @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath86 , @xmath138 ,  , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the order of the correlation function @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath142-labelled leaves correspond to incoming trajectories starting in the lead and the @xmath143-labelled leaves correspond to the outgoing trajectories exiting into the lead .",
    "as we have seen , some encounters can touch the lead , but this can only happen if an @xmath103-encounter has @xmath103 vertices with labels @xmath142 connected to it ( @xmath142-touch ) or @xmath103 vertices with labels @xmath143 connected to it ( @xmath143-touch ) .",
    "for example , in figure  [ fig : tree_example ] , the vertex @xmath52 can @xmath142-touch , the vertex @xmath144 can @xmath143-touch and the vertex @xmath53 can do neither .    when an encounter _ can _ touch the lead , the total answer we seek is the sum of the contributions from when it _ does _ and when it _ does not _ do it .",
    "equivalently , we can take the multiplicative factor of an encounter to be the sum of all factors it can produce . to illustrate this point",
    ", we revisit the calculation of @xmath109 and rewrite equation in the form @xmath145 this is the sum of contributions of three @xmath146-trees and one @xmath147-tree , see figure  [ fig : oreder3trees ] .",
    "the structure of a contribution is as follows : the prefactor is @xmath148 , where @xmath20 is half the number of leaves ( the order of the correlation function ) .",
    "then follow the factors corresponding to the vertices of the diagram .",
    "each vertex of degree @xmath134 ( corresponding to an @xmath103-encounter ) gives a multiplicative factor of @xmath149 modified by an additional @xmath150 if the vertex can @xmath143-touch and by @xmath151 if the vertex can @xmath142-touch , where @xmath97 is the number of @xmath143-leaves attached to the vertex . in the case",

    "an @xmath143-leaf could be chosen and the answer for @xmath32 should not depend on the choice .",
    "thus the function @xmath162 should be symmetric with respect to swapping the variables @xmath179 with @xmath180 , @xmath181 with @xmath182 and @xmath164 with @xmath169 .",
    "this is not apparent from ( [ eq : recur_f ] ) but will be checked ( and used ! ) at a later stage .",
    "now we can make the substitutions @xmath183 the substitutions give the contribution of each tree diagram as in , but we have included the powers of @xmath184 to keep track of which order correlation function they contribute to .",
    "indeed , the power of @xmath184 corresponding to a @xmath132 tree would be @xmath185 .",
    "substitution therefore gives a prefactor of @xmath186 and so to get the additional factor of @xmath126 we need for the correct prefactor , we introduce @xmath187 .",
    "the function @xmath188 is a generating function of the `` restricted '' coefficients @xmath166 , i.e. @xmath189 performing all the changes of variable , apart from for now , from we arrive at @xmath190 and a similar equation for @xmath191 .",
    "the sums can be performed easily , especially when we notice that the first two terms correspond to the @xmath192 terms of the two sums , leading to @xmath193 taking the numerator of the above equation , we arrive at @xmath194+(\\rmi\\epsilon)^2rg\\gh = 0 , \\ ] ] and similarly for @xmath191 @xmath195+(\\rmi\\epsilon)^2rg\\gh = 0 .\\ ] ] we have written the equations in a form that highlights the symmetric terms involving @xmath196 . taking the difference between and we obtain @xmath197",
    "this can now be substituted back into or to give an implicit equation for @xmath188 or @xmath191 , although we only state the result after the simplifying substitution from @xmath198\\left(1+r\\right)=\\frac{rg^2}{\\left(1-\\rmi\\epsilon\\right)}\\left[g-\\frac{1}{\\left(1-\\rmi\\epsilon\\right)}-\\frac{\\epsilon^2}{\\left(1-\\rmi\\epsilon\\right)}\\right ] , \\ ] ] putting all substitutions apart from  ( [ eq : substausigma ] ) into , and defining @xmath199 , we obtain @xmath200",
    "though it is clear that the last two terms together are symmetric , this still needs to be checked for the first term .",
    "we can rewrite it as @xmath201 so that we can see the symmetry follows from .",
    "having verified the symmetry of the generating function @xmath202 we can put in the symmetry - breaking substitution , or rather the simpler and equivalent @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",
    "we finally get the generating function of the required semiclassical correlation functions @xmath205 from , we can see that the @xmath20-th moment is simply @xmath206 times the coefficient of @xmath207 in the expansion of @xmath202 .",
    "setting @xmath208 to cancel the factors of @xmath209 , we just need to extract the coefficients of @xmath210 from @xmath202 .",
    "to do so we let @xmath211 and obtain @xmath212 substituting @xmath213 , @xmath214 and setting @xmath215 in equation  , we get the equation @xmath216 for @xmath217 and , through relation  , the equation @xmath218 for the generating function of the moments . solving this , and taking the solution which gives the correct value of @xmath219 when @xmath220",
    ", we get exactly the generating function from rmt .",
    "as the semiclassically calculated moments match the rmt ones to all orders , we then recover the full distribution of the delay times from @xcite .",
    "for open chaotic systems we presented a semiclassical derivation of all moments of the individual delay times , up to leading order in inverse channel number .",
    "the derivation essentially relies on the twin properties of hyperbolicity and ergodicity of the chaotic dynamics : the latter for the possible return to nearby points to create encounters and the former to allow the reconnections inside those encounters .",
    "this leads to a result which is in agreement with the rmt prediction for the delay time distribution , a semicircle type law .",
    "notably this implies an upper bound on the longest delay time . in the derivation we relied heavily on the previous work on semiclassical expansions , in particular @xcite , which contain an implicit assumption of instant equilibration in the underlying classical dynamics .",
    "the influence of slower equilibration can be explored by treating the effect of the ehrenfest time on the semiclassical contributions @xcite . when the ehrenfest time becomes much larger than the typical time trajectories spend inside the system one",
    "recovers the classical exponential distribution of delay times .",
    "it is also interesting to explore the effect of moving from chaotic to mixed phase space ( with regular islands ) on the distribution of the delay times and this upper bound .",
    "the interference effects which lead to the current result rely on the chaotic dynamics and should be suppressed if the chaotic part is reduced . however , additional effects such as periodic orbit bifurcations @xcite can also be fairly strong .",
    "the moments of the delay times and in particular their upper bound could therefore be very sensitive measures to explore the dynamics inside quantum dots , and possibly used to measure the relative weights of the chaotic and regular parts of phase space .    by considering scattering matrix correlation functions , which were then treated semiclassically",
    ", we were able to derive equations that implicitly define the generating functions of the moments .",
    "it is worth noting here that such correlation functions are useful for investigating other questions , such as the density of states of chaotic andreev billiards .    restricting our attention to",
    "the leading order in inverse channel number resulted in limiting the contributing diagrams to trees only .",
    "this , in turn , allowed standard recursive tools to be used . looking beyond the leading order , the semiclassical diagrams have more complicated structures so that such tools can no longer be directly applied .",
    "thus , in our view , the remaining challenge of obtaining a semiclassical expansion of all moments to all orders is a task of significant technical difficulty .",
    "however , it is a task of particular interest , not only because the subleading orders should be influenced by the symmetries of the system , but also because the effects of a finite number of channels is of much experimental relevance .",
    "a solution to this problem would have to involve new combinatorial tools and we hope that a clear and general algebraic structure will emerge as a result of research in this direction .",
    "here we briefly outline the results for the correlation functions @xmath31 defined in . as these do not involve subtracting the identity matrix from each bracket ( as we did in ) we no longer need to change the contribution of certain diagonal pairs or subtract anything when the start channels coincide .",
    "we can therefore simply set both @xmath221 in the treatment of section  [ allmoments ] and generate @xmath31 instead .",
    "this simplification means that @xmath222 because of , so that @xmath188 is now given implicitly by @xmath223=\\frac{rg^2}{\\left(1-\\rmi\\epsilon\\right)}\\left[g-\\frac{1}{\\left(1-\\rmi\\epsilon\\right)}-\\frac{\\epsilon^2}{\\left(1-\\rmi\\epsilon\\right)}\\right ] , \\ ] ] where in fact the only difference is that the @xmath224 on the left hand side of has disappeared .",
    "we can generate the first few terms in the expansion @xmath225 as @xmath226 adding the contribution from the top node in @xmath162 , we obtain the full generating function of @xmath31 , which is given by @xmath227 the expansion @xmath228 then leads to @xmath229=\\frac{1 - 2\\rmi\\epsilon-2\\epsilon^2}{\\left(1-\\rmi\\epsilon\\right)^4 } , \\\\ c(\\epsilon,3)&=\\left[g_{2}+2g_{1}g_{0}+{g_{0}}^{3}\\right]=\\frac{1 - 4\\rmi\\epsilon-9\\epsilon^2 + 8\\rmi\\epsilon^3 + 5\\epsilon^4}{\\left(1-\\rmi\\epsilon\\right)^7 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which are exactly the correlation functions we can obtain by considering the diagrams explicitly as in section  [ firstmoments ] . combining these results in line with expanding ,",
    "we recover the first three functions @xmath32 calculated in section  [ firstmoments ] . we could also continue to generate terms to obtain the moments via .",
    "however , the function @xmath230 contains more information than just the moments , for example by setting @xmath231 we see that @xmath232 .",
    "hence @xmath233 which shows that @xmath234^n = m , \\ ] ] and that the unitarity of the scattering matrix holds semiclassically for all powers @xmath20 to leading order in inverse channel number .",
    "as another example , this function @xmath202 and the correlation functions it generates appear in the density of states of chaotic andreev billiards @xcite ."
