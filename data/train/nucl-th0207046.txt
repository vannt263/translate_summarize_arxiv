    "charge symmetry is a special case of the general flavour symmetry of qcd , which at its simplest distinguishes the proton and the neutron ( or @xmath6 and @xmath7 quarks ) .",
    "it is , of course , trivially broken by the electromagnetic interaction , notably the coulomb force in comparisons of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 systems and by the magnetic interaction in the @xmath3 system .",
    "other well known sources are the @xmath3 mass difference and @xmath10- as well as @xmath11-meson mixing . these in turn may be related to the up- and down - quark mass difference - the microscopic flavour symmetry breaking in qcd .",
    "one might consider remarkable the fact that , although the relative quark mass difference is large ( @xmath12 ) , the symmetry breaking at the observable hadron level is two orders of magnitude smaller .    in the mirror system",
    "@xmath8 vs. @xmath9 csb has been studied for many decades @xcite , while its appearance in the @xmath3 system was first seen only a decade ago @xcite as the difference @xmath13 of elastic analyzing powers .",
    "different csb observables have been seen in calculations to be sensitive to different combinations of sources .",
    "for example , in @xmath3 scattering above 300 mev the @xmath3 mass difference in ope dominates , while at and below @xmath14 200 mev @xmath11 meson mixing and the magnetic interaction become about equally important@xcite .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath8 vs. @xmath9 difference is dominated by @xmath11 meson mixing @xcite .",
    "the csb effects in the @xmath3 system change the total isospin of the two nucleons ( class iv in the terminology of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , whereas in @xmath8 and @xmath9 the isospin must be conserved ( class iii ) .",
    "it is easily seen that in the reaction @xmath15 the isospin change @xmath16 implies a csb asymmetry of the unpolarized cross section about 90@xmath17 and vice versa .",
    "namely , due to the generalized pauli principle and conservation of the angular momentum and parity , with isospin one initial states for odd @xmath18 only singlet - even initial states are possible and for even @xmath18 only triplet - odd states .",
    "the presence of some isospin zero component in the initial state introduces opposite spin - parity assignments and the initial spin states will then have both parities involved .",
    "this minor asymmetry is being measured in an on - going experiment at triumf @xcite .    since class iv forces mentioned above",
    "change the isospin , as an initial state interaction they can quite naturally give rise to @xmath19 final states even from initial @xmath20 @xmath3 states .",
    "further , although in a purely nucleonic basis @xmath10 mixing force conserves the isospin ( class iii ) , it can cause a @xmath20 @xmath21 admixture even in initial isospin zero states @xcite and thus contribute to pion production from these states .",
    "in addition @xmath10 mixing can contribute very explicitly in the final actual production vertex in the form of production first of an isoscalar @xmath22 meson which then transforms into a pion .    of traditional csb mechanisms in pion production @xmath10 mixing",
    "is important and was seen to dominate at threshold @xcite , while the @xmath3 mass difference becomes more important at higher energies , where the two @xmath10 mixing mechanisms described above tend to cancel @xcite .    exploiting the fact that chiral symmetry gives predictions for effects arising from the small but explicit breaking of this symmetry generated by the quark masses , ref . @xcite",
    "employed a csb effective lagrangian based on chiral symmetry and including the @xmath6 and @xmath7 quark mass differences @xmath23 to describe pion - nucleon @xmath24-wave rescattering in @xmath25 .",
    "this rescattering dominates isospin conserving production at threshold . here",
    "@xmath26 represents the pauli matrices in isospin space , @xmath27 mev is the pion decay constant , and @xmath28 , though for simplicity @xmath29 was used .",
    "it is important to note that the pion - nucleon interaction in the second term is linked by chiral symmetry to the first term , which in turn is directly related to the neutron - proton mass difference giving @xmath30 . here",
    "@xmath31 is an electromagnetic `` hard photon '' exchange contribution to the neutron - proton mass difference also related to the isospin violating pion - nucleon interaction in the effective lagrangian @xmath32 this csb rescattering mechanism is presented in fig .",
    "1a .    above",
    ", the quark mass difference is by no means small as compared with their sum but rather @xmath33 with @xmath34 , although the individual parameters @xmath35 and @xmath31 are not completely uniquely determined and remain model dependent .",
    "their values have reasonable ranges 23 mev and ( 0.5)(1.5 ) mev , respectively .    at the triumf experiment energy 279.5 mev the integrated forward - backward asymmetry @xmath36 } { \\int_0^\\pi d\\omega \\ ; \\sigma(\\theta)}.                \\label{asym}\\ ] ]",
    "was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite in terms of the above mass differences as @xmath37 where the conventional meson contributions in the first term have been taken from ref .",
    "@xcite . due to the dominance of the @xmath10 mixing",
    ", the uncertainties in its strength directly scale that term .",
    "apart from minor pionic effects due to the @xmath3 mass difference , it is proportional to @xmath38 .",
    "the values @xmath39 and @xmath40 mev@xmath41 have been used for this result .",
    "( in addition , the analogous effect from @xmath42 with the same coupling and the mixing matrix element 5500 mev@xmath41 was icluded @xcite . )",
    "since in eq .",
    "( [ afb ] ) @xmath35 and @xmath31 add constructively , the latter term arising from the new effective lagrangian easily dominates the total @xmath43 making it change sign . with the given first term , the total @xmath43 would vary in the range 0.30.6% .",
    "it is unlikely that the first term is an overestimate , so the range might rather be even more positive . with the anticipated experimental resolution of 0.12% @xcite this is a significant result .",
    "if the uncertainties in the @xmath10 mechanisms ( notably the @xmath44 coupling constant ) can be solved , csb pion production could set constraints also on @xmath35 and @xmath31 .",
    "since the new effective csb interaction gave such a large contribution in pion production , one is prone to worry how much this @xmath45 rescattering might contribute to elastic @xmath1 scattering possibly breaking the consensus there . in ref . @xcite the csb @xmath1 two - pion exchange interaction depicted in fig .",
    "1b was shown in lowest order ( in the static approximation for baryons ) to be of the form of class iii @xmath46 [ \\mu^2+({\\bf k } -{\\bf q}/2)^2]},\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the pion - nucleon coupling constant and @xmath48 the pion mass . a similar expression resulted for exchanges involving an intermediate @xmath49 isobar ( fig . 1c ) .",
    "contrary to pion production , in this case , although the integrals and parameters are rather large , the two mass differences cancel to a large extent leaving only rather small contributions to the difference between @xmath9 and @xmath8 scattering . to see this , one need only compare the range of the factor @xmath50 [ + 0.8(-0.2 ) mev ] with the range of @xmath51 [ 2.23.4 mev ]",
    "correspondingly , the contributions to the scattering length and effective range differences @xmath4 and @xmath5 vary between 0.17 fm and 0.05 fm , and 0.003 and 0.001 fm , respectively .",
    "also the contribution from this source to the @xmath52h@xmath52he binding energy difference is expected to be small .",
