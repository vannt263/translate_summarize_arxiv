    "superconductivity is a ubiquitous phenomenon in metals : according to a commonly held view , all metals become either superconducting or magnetic at low enough temperatures .",
    "however , the corresponding transition temperatures may be ( so far ) unobservably low . in conventional superconductors , such as al , hg , or nb , the transition temperature depends exponentially on the inverse of the bcs coupling constant , and whereas the coupling constant itself may be fairly large ( the relevant energy scale connected with it may be many times larger than the thermal energy at room temperature ) , the resulting transition temperature typically does not much exceed 10 k. this property is intrinsically related to the quadratic dependence of electrons energy on momentum , which leads to a logarithmic divergence in the bcs self - consistency equation . with a higher - order dispersion around the fermi energy ,",
    "the relation between the magnitudes of the critical temperature and the coupling constant becomes stronger , boosting the superconductivity .",
    "the extreme case would be a completely dispersionless energy spectrum , the so called `` flat band '' .",
    "fermionic systems with dispersionless branches of excitation spectrum have quite unusual properties ; nowadays they attract lots of research interest .",
    "flat bands were predicted in many condensed matter systems , see for example @xcite . in some cases",
    "the flat bands are protected by topology in momentum space ; they emerge on the surfaces of gapless topological matter@xcite such as surfaces of nodal superconductors @xcite , graphene edges @xcite , surfaces of multilayered graphene structures @xcite , and in the cores of quantized vortices in topological superfluids and superconductors @xcite .",
    "the singular density of states ( dos ) associated with the dispersionless spectrum was recently shown by us to essentially enhance the transition temperature opening a new route to room - temperature superconductivity .",
    "the problem is to find the metal with such a higher - order dispersion around the fermi sea .",
    "along with our collaborators , we have shown @xcite that within the nearest - neighbour approximation , rhombohedral graphite has topologically protected surface states with a flat band at the fermi energy , and these surface states support high - temperature superconductivity where the superconducting order parameter is concentrated around the surfaces .",
    "such a superconductor may also carry a large surface supercurrent with a critical value proportional to the large critical temperature .",
    "the corresponding critical temperature depends linearly on the pairing interaction strength and can be thus considerably higher than the usual exponentially small critical temperature in the bulk . a flat band forms out of a low dispersive band that appears on the surface of a multilayered graphene structure with rhombohedral stacking with a large number of layers .",
    "surface superconductivity is favorable already for a system having @xmath0 layers , where the normal - state spectrum has a power - law dispersion @xmath1 as a function of the in - plane momentum @xmath2 .",
    "the dos @xmath3 has a singularity at zero energy which results in a drastic enhancement of the critical temperature .",
    "however , next - nearest neighbour hoppings which are present in real rhombohedral graphite can break the exact topological protection and , therefore , the flat - band mechanism of superconductivity at sufficiently low values of the coupling constant can be destroyed . here",
    "we study the detailed effect of these higher - order interactions and show that though they indeed break the flat - band scenario for weak superconducting coupling , they provide another mechanism of surface superconductivity which is of the bcs type but has a much larger coupling constant than the usual superconductivity in bulk graphite .",
    "this large coupling constant comes from a large dos associated with a heavy effective mass of surface quasiparticles that is clearly distinguishable on the background of the flat band which would exist without the higher - order interactions .",
    "both these mechanisms favor the high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "our results provide a criterion for the parameters needed to obtain the highest critical temperature",
    ". they may be relevant in explaining the recent experimental findings @xcite reporting the observation of even room - temperature superconductivity in doped graphite .",
    "here we briefly outline the main results of our paper .",
    "more detailed calculations are described in the following sections . in this work",
    "we study rhombohedral graphite by taking into account , besides the lowest - order interlayer hopping energy @xmath4 , also the higher - order hoppings @xmath5 and @xmath6 . from these , only the latter breaks the topological protection of the flat band .",
    "we find that , even in the presence of all these interactions , rhombohedral graphite still has surface states .",
    "however , instead of a flat band of radius @xmath7 they have a weak dispersion @xmath8 within the region @xmath9 . here",
    "a small factor @xmath10 arises from the higher - order interlayer hopping @xmath6 ; @xmath11 is the zero - order intralayer nearest - neighbour hopping energy , @xmath12 is the fermi velocity in graphene , and @xmath13 is the chemical potential",
    ". these surface states are not symmetric with respect to the point @xmath14 , more or less in the same way as the presence of the next - neighbour coupling breaks the electron - hole symmetry in graphene @xcite . for @xmath15 ,",
    "the energy of the surface states deviates rapidly from @xmath13 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig:3dspectrum ] and [ fig:2dnormalspectrum ] ) .",
    "qualitatively , the energy gap is localized at the surface and can be determined by a simplified self - consistency equation , which for @xmath16 and @xmath17 has the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a superconducting coupling energy proportional to the pairing interaction @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the distance between the layers . equation ( [ eq : selfcons1 ] ) yields @xmath22 we thus find that for @xmath23 , the gap @xmath24 is exponentially small , similar to conventional bcs superconductors , whereas for larger coupling constant @xmath24 tends to the flat - band result @xcite @xmath25 which is linear in the coupling strength .",
    "these values of @xmath24 yield critical temperatures @xmath26 of the order @xmath27 , the exact prefactor depending on which of the above regimes the coupling constant is .",
    "the above considerations help to identify the regime of parameters where extremely high - temperature surface superconductivity might be found . in our estimates",
    ", we use the tight - binding parameters summarized in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , which gives @xmath28 ev , @xmath29 ev , @xmath30 ev , and @xmath31 ev .",
    "we disregard the next - nearest neighbour intralayer hopping proportional to @xmath32 ev and even smaller interaction across two layers .",
    "in addition of its small relative magnitude , the next - nearest hopping @xmath33 does not affect the conical dispersion of single graphene layer and thus is not expected to essentially modify our results .",
    "note , however , that also widely different values of higher - order hopping constants are discussed in literature @xcite , especially with a much higher @xmath6 ( for example @xcite claims @xmath34 ) . with the above values , the crossover between the two regimes takes place around @xmath35 0.04  0.08 ev ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : selfconsdelta ] below ) .",
    "thus , for @xmath36 , the gap and the critical temperature would be exponentially small whereas for @xmath37 it would be @xmath38 k. this is much larger than the expected gap in the bulk for the same magnitude of the coupling .",
