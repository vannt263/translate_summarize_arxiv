    "can be adapted for computing sample partial canonical correlations .",
    "one now carries out principal components analysis of the data from all three processes and then regresses the scores for the @xmath297 process data onto the scores from the @xmath55 sample paths .",
    "the example  [ examcomp ] computational scheme is then applied to the residuals from the two regression analyses .    to illustrate the idea ,",
    "consider again the two processes from example  [ examcomp ] .",
    "sample paths were generated as before except that in each instance we subtracted a term @xmath298 with @xmath299 a standard normal random variable and @xmath300 equal to 1 for the @xmath55 process and 2 for the @xmath54 process .",

    "we have developed a framework that can be used to study the correlation properties of groups of hilbert space indexed stochastic processes .",
    "our applications have been restricted to groups of size two or three ; however , it is clear that similar analyses are possible with any finite number of processes .",
    "for example , the partial canonical correlation work of section  [ sec3 ] extends in principle to examination of pairs of residual processes after correcting for projections onto several other processes .",
    "we note in passing that it has been assumed that all the @xmath0-valued random variables take values in the same hilbert space .",
    "the extension to where some or all of the variables produce elements of different hilbert spaces incurs some additional notational expense but is otherwise straightforward .",

    "we next turn to the proof of theorem  [ thccachar ] .",
