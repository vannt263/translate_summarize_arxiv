    "the oscillations of differentially rotating systems are important in many areas of astrophysics .",
    "they are of particular relevance to neutron star astrophysicists , because non - axisymmetric oscillations of compact stars are promising sources of gravitational waves .",
    "detection and interpretation of gravitational waves from oscillating neutron stars could answer many questions about neutron star physics that are difficult to answer using electromagnetic observations , for example regarding the supranuclear equation of state .",
    "emission of gravitational waves from neutron star oscillations will be strongest if the oscillations can grow via some dynamical or secular instability .",
    "the most promising instability scenarios arise for newly - born , accreting or newly - merged neutron stars .",
    "but it is in precisely these situations that we expect the stars to be differentially rotating .",
    "the latest simulations of core collapse indicate that the nascent neutron star emerges rotating differentially @xcite .",
    "@xcite has shown that rapid accretion from a companion could drive differential rotation in the surface layers of the neutron star , and a similar effect may occur during rapid accretion of supernova fallback material @xcite . @xcite and @xcite have shown that a long - lived massive differentially rotating neutron star may be generated as the result of the merger of two neutron stars .",
    "in addition , recent work on r - modes in neutron stars suggests that the modes may drive a uniformly rotating star into differential rotation via non - linear effects @xcite .",
    "understanding the effect of differential rotation will be critical if we are to model gravitational wave emission from these systems correctly .",
    "differential rotation introduces two interesting phenomena .",
    "firstly , it may lead to dynamical shear instabilities @xcite .",
    "secondly , the dynamical equations of the inviscid problem are complicated by the presence of corotation points",
    ". these are points where the pattern speed of a mode matches the local angular velocity , and at these points the governing equations are formally singular .",
    "the range of frequencies for which modes possess corotation points is termed the corotation band .",
    "it gives rise to a continuous spectrum , the dynamical role of which is unclear .",
    "neither issue has received significant attention in the stellar perturbation literature ( see @xcite , hereafter referred to as paper i , for a summary of previous work ) .",
    "we have begun to address the problem by modelling a simple system , a differentially rotating incompressible spherical shell .",
    "this model is simplistic , but exhibits the main features of the more complex three - dimensional problem . in paper",
    "i we conducted a normal mode analysis for the shell . in the uniform rotation limit",
    "the shell problem admits only the standard r - modes as solutions . as the degree of differential rotation increases",
    ", the frequencies of these modes gradually approach the lower edge of the expanding corotation band .",
    "most modes approach the boundary tangentially and appear to cease to exist when the degree of differential rotation exceeds a certain threshold value . in only a few cases do modes cross the corotation band boundary .    for real frequencies in the corotation band",
    "the shell problem admits a continuous spectrum of solutions with discontinuous first derivatives . in general , the continuous spectrum solutions have both a logarithmic singularity and a finite step in the first derivative at the corotation point . for certain special frequencies , however , the step in the first derivative vanishes .",
    "we refer to these solutions as zero - step solutions .",
    "since these solutions appear when regular normal modes cross into the corotation band , they are likely to be of particular importance . furthermore ,",
    "in differentially rotating cylinders , these solutions can merge to give rise to dynamical instabilities @xcite .",
    "even though we do not observe such behaviour in our problem it is an interesting possibility that should not be overlooked in future studies .",
    "the character of the modes that cross into the corotation band varies .",
    "only in one exceptional case , for the simplest rotation law examined , do we observe a mode crossing the corotation band boundary and continuing to exist as a regular stable mode .",
    "we think that such regular modes within the corotation band are unlikely to exist for more realistic rotation laws . in general , at all points where modes cross the corotation band boundary we observe the development of zero - step solutions . at some points",
    "we also observe the development of dynamically unstable modes . a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for dynamical instability",
    "is that the equilibrium vorticity have a turning point on the shell .",
    "some of the rotation laws examined in paper i meet this condition when the degree of differential rotation exceeds a certain threshold value .",
    "all modes crossing the corotation band boundary above this threshold become dynamically unstable .",
    "in addition , we observe for one rotation law the development of dynamical instability via the merger of two stable modes outside the corotation band .",
    "paper i raised a number of questions .",
    "is it possible to derive a necessary and sufficient condition for instability ?",
    "do the singular solutions of the continuous spectrum have physical meaning ? and do the zero - step solutions appear distinct from the continuous spectrum in time evolutions ? in this paper we resolve these questions by addressing the initial value problem for the shell . by trying to isolate the various contributions to the evolution of smooth initial data",
    ", we hope to clarify the physical role of different parts of the spectrum of a differentially rotating system .",
    "the results for this simple toy model will guide us in future investigations of the three dimensional problem @xcite .",
    "in paper i we analysed the normal mode problem for the differentially rotating spherical shell .",
    "since we will refer to a number of the results from the mode analysis in this paper , we summarise the key results in this section . consider an incompressible fluid on a differentially rotating spherical shell ( with radius @xmath0 ) .",
    "assuming that the perturbations are @xmath1 we have the @xmath2-component of the perturbed euler equation ,    @xmath3    and the @xmath4-component @xmath5 where the equilibrium vorticity is @xmath6 the perturbed continuity equation for an incompressible fluid is @xmath7 this tells us that only toroidal modes are permitted in this problem . defining the stream function ( in the standard way ) @xmath8 we can combine equations ( [ thetaeuler ] ) and ( [ phieuler ] ) to give the vorticity equation @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the laplacian on the unit sphere .",
    "changing variables to @xmath11 the vorticity equation becomes @xmath12 where @xmath13 and we use a prime to denote derivatives with respect to @xmath14 . in terms of @xmath14 the equilibrium vorticity is @xmath15 assuming that we are interested in a mode solution behaving as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the frequency , equation ( [ voryt ] ) becomes    @xmath18    at corotation points ( @xmath19 ) , @xmath20 and the equations are formally singular .",
    "the nature of the solutions in the vicinity of the corotation point can be analysed using the method of frobenius .",
    "the general solution is found to be    @xmath21    where    @xmath22    and      we use separate solutions for @xmath24 on either side of the corotation point to avoid taking the logarithm of a negative quantity .",
    "the two solutions for @xmath24 are matched such that @xmath25 is continuous at the corotation point .",
    "the first derivatives are however discontinuous at @xmath26 , with ( in general ) both a logarithmic singularity and a step discontinuity .",
    "the size of this step discontinuity in @xmath27 varies as one traverses the frequency band spanned by the continuous spectrum , and for certain special frequencies it vanishes .",
    "we refer to the solutions at these frequencies as zero - step solutions . at the zero - step frequencies the wronskian of the two linearly independent solutions to equation ( [ vorteq3 ] ) vanishes , despite the logarithmic discontinuity in the first derivative .",
    "the importance of this will become apparent .",
    "let us now consider dynamical instabilities . from equation ( [ voryt ] )",
    "it is possible to derive the necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for instability @xmath28 .",
    "this condition is met for some of the rotation laws considered in paper i when the degree of differential rotation exceeds some threshold value .",
    "dynamical instabilities are then found to develop both where modes meet the corotation band boundary , and where modes merge outside the corotation band .",
    "in this paper we consider equation ( [ voryt ] ) as an initial - value problem .",
    "that is , we are interested in the evolution of prescribed initial data , say , @xmath29 we first transform the problem into the frequency domain via the laplace transform ( we use @xmath30 in order to allow direct comparison with the mode calculations in paper i ) .",
    "@xmath31 with inverse @xmath32 applying this transform to equation ( [ voryt ] ) we find @xmath33 note that @xmath34 is always non - zero for this problem .",
    "the only non - zero smooth initial data for which @xmath35 would violate the boundary conditions .",
    "we should also make a brief comment on the laplace transform . for growing oscillatory @xmath25 , with time dependence @xmath36 $ ] , equation ( [ gov ] ) is only correct if the imaginary part of @xmath17 , @xmath37 , is greater than @xmath38 .",
    "otherwise the transform would fail to converge as @xmath39 .",
    "we must therefore ensure that the constant @xmath40 , which appears in the limits of integration of the inverse laplace transform in equation ( [ lapinv ] ) , lies above all of the poles of the integrand .",
    "this means that we must have @xmath41 .",
    "thus on the line integral , we always have @xmath42 , and we never breach the assumption that we made when taking the laplace transform .",
    "we then assume analytic continuation of the laplace transform into the entire complex @xmath17 plane , and use the residue theorem to evaluate the line integral .",
    "this does not change the situation : the line integral itself always has @xmath42 and the laplace transform and its inverse are well - defined .",
    "we will now use the green s function method to derive a formal solution to this equation ( assuming for the moment that the problem is regular ) .",
    "given a solution @xmath43 to @xmath44 we have @xmath45 note that because of the symmetry of the problem we need only consider the upper hemisphere of the shell .",
    "finally , inverting the transform we obtain the solution to the initial value problem @xmath46 the analytic properties of the integrand determine the spectrum of the problem .    in the standard way",
    ", we construct the required green s function @xmath47 from solutions to the homogeneous problem .",
    "thus we want to solve @xmath48 consider two solutions , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , that satisfy the boundary conditions at the left and right endpoints of the interval , respectively . using the differential equation one can easily show that the wronskian of any two solutions can be written @xmath51 pick an arbitrary point @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "then an overall solution , that is continuous at @xmath53 , can be written @xmath54 .",

    "unfortunately , we can not in general solve even the homogeneous problem ( for @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) analytically .",
    "it is however possible to generate specific toy problems for which the initial value problem may be solved analytically .",
    "we are particularly interested in the behaviour of the continuous spectrum and the zero - step solutions .",
    "we therefore develop two toy problems .",
    "the first is a particular rotation law that admits only a continuous spectrum as a solution .",
    "an analytic solution of the initial value problem is possible for simple initial data , and the solution sheds light on the physical nature of the perturbation . in the second problem we aim to investigate the nature of the zero - step solutions .",
    "ideally one would like to find a simple rotation law , with a zero - step solution , for which one could solve the initial value problem analytically .",
    "we have not been able to identify such a law .",
    "instead we have developed a toy mathematical problem with solutions that include both a continuous spectrum and a zero - step solution .",
    "the behaviour of the eigenfunctions of this system near the critical point is mathematically identical to the behaviour that we find for the shell problem .",
    "the initial value problem for our toy system can however be solved analytically , guiding us towards a quasi - analytic solution for the zero - step solutions and continuous spectrum of the shell problem .",
    "the details of the two toy problems are contained in appendices [ simple ] and [ notsosimple ] . in this section",
    "we summarise only the key results from each problem .",
    "appendix [ simple ] presents a full analytic solution of the initial value problem on the shell , for a simple rotation law that possesses only a continuous spectrum ( with no zero - step solutions ) . for simple initial data the collective perturbation associated with the continuous spectrum",
    "is found to be non - singular , and hence physical .",
    "the perturbation dies away with time , with inverse power law decay rather than exponential decay .",
    "the frequency of the decaying perturbation depends in part upon position .",
    "similar behaviour has been found for the continuous spectrum of a differentially rotating cylinder @xcite .",
    "appendix [ notsosimple ] introduces a toy problem that has singular continuous spectrum eigenfunctions with behaviour similar to those of our problem . by careful selection of boundary conditions",
    ", one can ensure the presence of a single zero - step solution within the continuous spectrum . in this case",
    "we are able to make some progress towards an analytic solution of the initial value problem .",
    "we draw several important conclusions that are likely to transfer to the differentially rotating shell .",
    "firstly , the physical perturbation contains a constant amplitude oscillatory component at the zero - step frequency .",
    "secondly , just as in appendix [ simple ] , the rest of the continuous spectrum dies away with time for simple initial data .",
    "again we find inverse power law decay rather than exponential decay .",
    "the frequency of the perturbation associated with the continuous spectrum is , as before , found to depend in part upon position .",
    "let us now proceed as far as we can with the analytic solution to the initial value problem for the differentially rotating shell .",
    "we start by considering the integral over position , equation ( [ i2 ] ) .",
    "we will write @xmath60 , where the corotation point @xmath61 is a function of @xmath17 .",
    "equation ( [ i2 ] ) becomes    @xmath62    if @xmath17 is in the range of @xmath63 , then @xmath64 and the integrand will be singular at @xmath65 .",
    "in paper i we examined the variation of @xmath66 with @xmath67 and found that in the vicinity of the corotation point ( @xmath68 ) , for real @xmath17 , it behaves as    @xmath69    whether @xmath61 is greater than or less than @xmath14 will depend on @xmath17 .",
    "if @xmath70 , the first integral in equation ( [ pvreq ] ) has a pole and a branch point at @xmath71 , and we must treat the integral as a principal value integral .",
    "if on the other hand @xmath72 , then it is the second integral that must be treated as a principal value integral . the same procedure is followed in appendix [ notsosimple ] .",
    "these integrals are not easily evaluated analytically ; one must in general resort to numerical methods to solve even the homogeneous problem for @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "however , by examining the power series expansions around the singular point , which are identical to the power series expansions around the singular point for the problem in appendix [ notsosimple ] , it is easy to see that the principal value integrals must result in smooth , non - singular functions .",
    "thus even without solving the integrals analytically , we can state that the first integral will give rise to a function @xmath73 and the second integral to a function @xmath74 , where both @xmath75 and @xmath76 are smooth , non - singular functions .",
    "the frequency integral , equation ( [ i1 ] ) , becomes    @xmath77   e^{-i\\omega t } d\\omega.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we can not solve this integral analytically .",
    "instead , we will use cauchy s theorem to extract its properties .",
    "we complete the contour using a semicircle of infinite radius in the lower half plane that must be deformed around any branch cuts .",
    "the contribution from the semicircle integral vanishes because the integrand tends to zero on this part of the contour .",
    "the only non - zero contribution will come from the poles and branch cuts of the integrand .",
    "we know from paper i that there are zeroes of @xmath78 at frequencies at which there are discrete normal modes , and at frequencies within the continuous spectrum where there are zero - step solutions .",
    "@xmath78 has a zero of multiplicity one in all cases except where modes or zero - step solutions merge : at these frequencies it has a zero of multiplicity two .",
    "we must also consider the behaviour of @xmath66 .",
    "this function is well - behaved and non - singular except for @xmath17 within the range of @xmath63 .",
    "let us first consider the behaviour near the frequency @xmath79 , the corotation frequency .",
    "we need to know how @xmath66 varies with @xmath17 for fixed @xmath14 .",
    "this would in principle require a numerical calculation , but for the fact that we do know how @xmath66 varies with @xmath14 for fixed @xmath17 in the vicinity of the point @xmath80 . because @xmath26 is a function of @xmath17",
    ", we can rewrite our power series expansions as an expansion around the singular frequency rather than the singular position ( see appendix [ notsosimple ] , where the equivalence is clearer ) .",
    "we find that @xmath66 is non - singular but has a branch point at @xmath79 .",
    "the two end points of the continuous spectrum , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are also branch points .",
    "the contour of integration should look similar to that shown in figure [ xsep ] .",
    "we can now make some definitive statements about the time - dependence of the physical perturbation @xmath83 .    1 .",
    "the poles of the integrand at discrete frequencies @xmath84 where the wronskian is zero will contribute terms with simple oscillatory time dependence @xmath85 .",
    "this is true both for discrete normal modes and the zero - step solutions .",
    "thus by virtue of having zero wronskian , the zero - step frequencies should appear virtually indistinguishable from the standard discrete normal modes , despite being in the continuous spectrum .",
    "2 .   at frequencies where modes merge and the wronskian has a double pole we will have additional terms of the form @xmath86 . such linear growth signals the onset of instability , as can be seen if one considers an unstable mode exhibiting exponential growth @xmath87 $ ] . for small @xmath88 this can be expressed as a taylor series : + @xmath89.\\ ] ] + this behaviour is to be expected since mode mergers usually lead to dynamical instability @xcite .",
    "3 .    the behaviour of the continuous spectrum is more difficult to ascertain but , since the end points of the corotation band on the real line are branch points , we would expect decaying oscillatory behaviour similar to that found in appendix [ notsosimple ] .",
    "the frequency of oscillation will inevitably depend in part upon position .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility of constant amplitude oscillation , or even growth of the continuous spectrum , in response to some initial data .",
    "what is clear , however , is that the perturbation associated with the continuous spectrum is non - singular and hence physical .",
    "having discussed the general properties of the solution , we will now use an analytic approach to the problem to derive a sufficient condition for instability .",
    "we follow the method outlined by @xcite for inviscid plane parallel shear flow .",
    "we start by reference to equation ( [ ode2 ] ) , the equation obeyed by @xmath55 .",
    "let us assume that we can normalise the solution in such a way that    @xmath90    we assume that @xmath91 is real ( note that , strictly speaking , @xmath91 will depend on @xmath17 and @xmath67 ) .",
    "then we find from equation ( [ ode2 ] ) that @xmath92 hence @xmath93    in the limit when @xmath17 is real but outside the range @xmath94 for @xmath26 in [ 0,1 ] , @xmath95 is real .",

    "if on the other hand @xmath17 is real , but in the range @xmath96 for @xmath97 $ ] , then the integrand is singular and the integral must be interpreted as the principal value were regular at the corotation point then the integrand would not be singular .",
    "this applies to both types of regular eigenfunction described in paper i , and can be seen from the power series expansions of the regular eigenfunctions around the singular point . ] .",
    "@xmath98 the sign depends on whether we circle the singularity in the upper or the lower half - plane .",
    "this quantity @xmath95 , as defined in equation ( [ epsdef ] ) , can be used to derive a sufficient instability criterion .",
    "our next step is to derive a useful expression for @xmath55 .    in section ( [ green ] )",
    "we constructed a green s function for the initial value problem , equation ( [ time2 ] ) , that depended on @xmath99 , which depends in turn on the solutions , @xmath66 , to the homogeneous problem .",

    "the zero - step solutions are an exception , having zero wronskian and a logarithmic discontinuity in the first derivative .",

    "we were also interested to see how the rest of the continuous spectrum behaved in response to an initial perturbation .",
    "the continuous spectrum was observed to die away with time for smooth initial data , and to be excited to a much lower extent than the modes and zero - step solutions .",
    "the numerical evolutions support the conclusions from our green s function analysis .",
    "in particular , it is clear that the zero - step solutions stand out from the rest of the continuous spectrum .",

    "the peak at around 825 for @xmath165 = 4 and 5 initial data is probably associated with the continuous spectrum and is an artefact of sampling position.,height=226 ]",
    "the main question arising from the normal mode analysis of paper i was the nature of the physical perturbations associated with the singular eigenfunctions of both the zero - step corotating solutions , and the continuous spectrum within which they exist . by studying the initial value problem",
    "both analytically and numerically we have been able to resolve this issue .",
    "firstly , we have confirmed that the physical perturbations associated with these phenomena are not singular .",
    "their time dependence in response to an initial perturbation , however , is complicated . for appropriate initial data ,",
    "the zero - step solutions behave in much the same way as stable normal modes outside corotation .",
    "that is , they produce a clear peak in the power spectrum at a fixed frequency , standing out from the rest of the continuous spectrum .",
    "the fact that such oscillatory solutions can exist within the continuous spectrum is of great relevance for future studies of the oscillations of differentially rotating systems .",
    "the behaviour of the rest of the continuous spectrum is difficult to predict analytically , and can only be elucidated by numerical time evolutions .",
    "the analytic calculations suggest that the physical perturbation associated with the continuous spectrum is oscillatory , with a complicated frequency dependence that varies in part according to the position on the shell .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillations could grow , remain at constant amplitude or die away with time ( as a an inverse power of time ) , depending on the initial data and the rotation law .",
    "for the rotation laws and initial data that we have studied we observe only decay , but we can not rule out either constant amplitudes or growth .",
    "the results of numerical time evolutions have verified to high accuracy the predictions of mode frequencies made by the normal mode analysis .",
    "this is true both for modes outside the corotation band ( including dynamically unstable modes ) , and the zero - step solutions within it .",
