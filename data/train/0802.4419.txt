    "the dynamics of molecular motors is an important topic in biophysics and nanotechnology . in the living and in the artificial nanoscale world",
    "fast non - diffusive directed transport or rotary motion constitute key ingredients of any complex structure .",
    "molecular motors are the `` nanomachines '' which perform these tasks @xcite .",
    "this definition involves a considerable amount of different molecules : motor proteins , such as myosin and kinesin , rna polymerases , topoisomerases , ...    in this paper we focus on the problem of directed motion over a substrate which is exemplified in the kinesin @xcite .",
    "active transport in eukariotic cells is driven by complex proteins like kinesin which moves cargo inside cells away from the nucleus along microtubules transforming chemical fuel ( atp molecule ) into mechanical work .",
    "kinesin is a two head protein linked by a domain ( neck ) and a tail which attach a cargo or vesicle to be carried .",
    "the two heads perform a processive walk over the substrate ( the microtubule ) .",
    "the way in which this process is performed attracts big interest in the research in molecular biology as well as in biological physics . in order to understand how kinesin works two properties that arise from the structure @xcite of the microtubules",
    "can not be forgotten : they have a regular , periodic structure and structural polarity ",
    "they are asymmetric with respect to their two ends , which determines the direction of kinesin motion    in the last fifteen years , experimental molecular biology has provide a lot of new results which allows to elucidate , at mesoscopic level , the main mechanisms for directed transport .",
    "these experimental evidences are mostly based in single molecules experiments  @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of these results is not always easy and many times are not conclusive on the detailed way in which the motor walks .",
    "two basic mechanisms have been proposed to explain the kinesin motion : `` inchworm '' and `` hand - over - hand '' motion ( see figure [ fig : hand_inch ] ) . in the first case ,",
    "one head does not overcome the other one . in this case",
    "the period of the motion is one period of the microtubule structure ( @xmath0 in the figure ) . in the hand - over - hand mechanism",
    "one head overcomes the other .",
    "now the period for each head is the double ( @xmath1 ) . in both cases",
    "the center of masses advances the same length .",
    "although first single molecule experiments were compatible with both mechanisms more recent experiments have shown @xcite in a very clever way that hand - over - hand motion may be more plausible .",
    "( color online ) schematic representation of the possible mechanisms of motion for the motor of kinesin . in the hand - over - hand case",
    "each head moves a distance equals to @xmath1 whereas in the inchworm the period of motion is @xmath0.,width=321 ]    two strategies can be devised in order to model the motion of molecular motors  @xcite .",
    "on one hand continuous models based on mirror symmetry breaking potentials ( ratchet potentials  @xcite ) or time symmetry broken driven forces  @xcite . on the other hand , discrete kinetics models which are based on the solution of master equations associated to different states of the motor ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "using either approximation both mechanisms have been studied : inchworm  @xcite or hand - over - hand  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study a minimalist mechanical continuous model for hand - over - hand motion that , we believe , captures the main features of biological motors .",
    "the model also has into account the properties of the microtubule substrate .",
    "the article is organised as follows : first we cast a two dimensional model which can mimic the motion of the motor . within of reasonable values of parameters",
    "we explore different regimes of motion . in the conclusions section",
    "we will discuss the validity of the results to model a molecular motor .",
    "in order to find a suitable model for the kinesin motor , its properties shall be studied carefully . ref .",
    "@xcite summarizes all these features : kinesin is a two - head protein which moves along the microtubule with @xmath2 steps , matching the repeat distance of the microtubule lattice ; each step needs 1 atp which is hydrolyzed and the movement stalls when a backward load of @xmath3 is applied .",
    "experiments reported in @xcite show , by marking one of the heads , that the motion follows the hand - over - hand mechanism , as a @xmath4 step is observed for each head , thus forbidding the movement proposed in the inchworm mechanism .",
    "the description of the movement is rather simple : the two heads of the kinesin are attached to the microtubule @xcite in two neighbor monomers until 1 atp molecule is hydrolyzed by the head backwards .",
    "this energy frees the head , which moves to a new binding place ahead the other one .",
    "two complementary mechanisms to understand how the particle released is able to find the next binding site have been proposed  @xcite : ( a ) the _ neck linker _",
    "mechanism assumes a conformational change in the neck between heads which moves the free head from one place to the next forwards .",
    "( b ) the _ diffusional search",
    "_ relies on the assumption that the noise associated to the thermal bath that surrounds the particle makes the free particle move , and this movement is preferably forwards and forced by the particle ahead which is attached to the microtubule .",
    "thermal fluctuations play a central role in the whole process . in the nanometer - length dimension and at room temperature ,",
    "motion is governed by randomness induced by the environment ( in this case the cytosol , made up mainly by water ) . at this scale damping and thermal noise are dominant and the dynamics can be studied by an overdamped langevin equation : @xmath5 here @xmath6 stands for external forces and @xmath7 for thermal noise , being @xmath8 ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 are cartesian components of the vector @xmath7 ) .",
    "we will model the kinesin as two interacting particles moving in the plane under the effect of flashing ratchet substrate potentials ( two particles moving in two dimensions ) .",
    "the potential energy of the system is given by @xmath11    the two heads of the kinesin are linked through a modified version of the finite extensible non - linear elastic ( fene ) interaction @xcite : @xmath12 with @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the stiffness of the neck , @xmath0 the equilibrium distance between heads and @xmath15 determines a maximum allowed separation , @xmath16 .    with respect to the substrate potentials ,",

    "the idea is to reproduce a cyclic motion .",
    "such a cycle has 4 steps , see fig .",
    "( [ fig : time ] . first ( @xmath33 ) both particles are confined close to the minima of their respective potentials and thus separated an averaged distance @xmath0 ( the natural length of the neck ) .",
    "after a given time @xmath34 some energy arrives at particle 1 for instance which does not see its substrate potential for a time @xmath35 . during this time this particle",
    "suffer a thermal diffusion only subjected to the interaction with the other particle .",
    "when @xmath21 is switched on again at @xmath36 , the particle slides down towards some minimum energy position .",
    "this step lasts another @xmath34 time and then at @xmath37 , @xmath20 is switched off for a @xmath38 time closing the cycle .",
    "the total period of this cycle is @xmath39 .",
    "as we will see , thanks to the asymmetric character of the potential a directed motion is obtained .    in order to compute the efficiency of the motion",
    "we define an efficiency parameter given by : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the average advance of particle 1 ( for instance ) per cycle of the potential .",
    "note that our definition of efficiency is basically the velocity of the motion , in fact the mean velocity can be computed as @xmath42 and is not related to the input of energy and the output of work .",
    "the important parameter here is @xmath38 , the time a particle has for the diffusive motion .",
    "@xmath34 only requires to be long enough to allow for relaxation towards a minimum , which in overdamped dynamics happens very fast .",
    "thus , in our simulations we have played with different values of @xmath38 and set @xmath43 .",
    "this value corresponds to a duty ratio @xmath44 which guarantees the processivity of the motion  @xcite .",
    "we will measure distance in units of @xmath45 nm , the distance between monomers in the microtubule , see also  @xcite .",
    "energy is measured in units of @xmath46 , the maximum value of the substrate potential .",
    "we choose @xmath47 @xmath48 ( at 300k ) @xcite .",
    "the natural unit of time will be @xmath49ns . here , @xmath50 is the damping coefficient used in the langevin equation ( @xmath51 , with @xmath52pa the viscosity of the water and @xmath53 the size of the head )",

    "we are going to present our results based in the numerical integration of the normalised system of equations for the two particles .",
    "the integration algorithm we use is a version of the runge - kutta algorithm for integration of stochastic differential equations ( @xmath56 ) @xcite .",
    "with respect to the different constants and parameters , unless extra information is given , the default normalized parameters will be we @xmath57 ( 300 k ) , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "[ fig : dynamics ] shows a typical example of the dynamics of the system at the parameter values listed above .",
    "there we can see that simulations reproduce the expected mechanism , a hand - over - hand net advance of the molecule .",
    "middle figure shows a detail of the top one .",
    "if both potentials are on , the particles do random motions around the minimum potential energy position .",
    "however , as one of the potentials is turned off , its linked particle starts to diffuse in 2d .",
    "the importance of the asymmetric mechanism is fully understood here .",
    "after @xmath35 , when the potential is turned on again , most of the times the particle is sited to the right of the maximum of the asymmetric potential and then typically moves down to the nearest minimum position . as we have said , due to the asymmetry of the potential",
    ", this minimum more frequently corresponds to the one to the right of the original one .",
    "clearly , the more asymmetric the potential is , the more likely the system moves forward .    in the third graph of fig .",

    "we have to decide how the total load @xmath90 is divided into the two heads of the protein .",
    "it seems obvious that a head can make an opposite force to the applied only in case it is fixed to the microtubule .",
