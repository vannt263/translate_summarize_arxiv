    "in the description of a many  body system , the word * correlation * indicates the fact that the state of each particle of the system depends on the presence of the other particles .    in an infinite system of interacting particles ,",
    "this definition of correlation can be exactly translated saying that _ anything beyond the fermi ",
    "gas model is a correlation_. for a finite set of particles the phrase _ anything beyond the shell model is a correlation _ , does not translate the definition of correlation given above since the mean  filed is already correlating the particles of the system , localising their presence around a specific point of the space .    a proper description of a finite many ",
    "body system should treat on the same ground the correlation generated by the mean  field and those produced by the residual interaction among the particles .    the correlated basis function theory ( cbf )",
    "provides a theoretical framework for this consistent treatment .",
    "the cbf has been applied successfully to both few  body systems and nuclear matter ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in recent years , we have started a work aimed to apply the cbf to the description of medium and heavy nuclei @xcite . in this report",
    "we shall present some recent results of this work .",
    "the cbf is based upon the variational principle @xmath0=\\delta \\frac { < \\psi | h | \\psi > } { < \\psi | \\psi > } = 0,\\ ] ] which corresponds exactly to the schrdinger equation if the variation is performed considering the full hilbert space of many  body wave functions , or in other words , if no limitations on the structure of the many  body wave function @xmath1 are enforced .    on the other hand ,",
    "one solves the variational principle instead of the schrdinger equation because one wants to work in a limited sub  space of the hilbert space .",
    "for example , the assumption that @xmath1 is a slater determinant of single particle wave functions leads to the hartree  fock equations .",
    "the assumption on the structure of @xmath1 used in the cbf is : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a slater determinant and @xmath4 is a many  body correlation function defined as a symmetrized product of two - body correlation functions : @xmath5\\ ] ] in the above equation @xmath6 represents the symmetrizer operator and the two  body correlation functions have been expressed in a most general form , where the state dependence , given by the operators @xmath7 , is , in general , the same of the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "this correlation operator contains only explicit two  body correlations .",
    "more general forms , mainly used in light nuclei , may also include three  body correlations .",
    "the variational procedure consists in performing the variation on the correlation function and on the set of single particle wave functions in order to find the minimum of the energy functional of eq .",
    "this requires the evaluation of complicated multidimensional integrals .",
    "the most direct approach to tackle the problem is the numerical evaluation performed with monte carlo technology . in this case",
    "the full procedure is called variational monte carlo ( vmc ) calculation .",
    "this brute force method is , unfortunately , not suitable to describe medium and heavy nuclei since the number of spin  isospin states to be sampled becomes enormous ( for the @xmath8ca nucleus is of the order of the avogadro number ) .",
    "since we are interested in the description of medium and heavy nuclei we used a different technique : the cluster expansion .",
    "this technique is better illustrated when the correlation function is purely scalar and commutes with the nuclear potential , @xmath9 . in this case",
    "the mean value of @xmath9 can be written as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 represents the distance between the @xmath12 and @xmath13 nucleons .",
    "the last equality of the previous equation follows from the orthonormality of the single particle wave functions .",
    "we definine a function @xmath14 as : @xmath15 the importance of this function lies in the fact that it is appreciably different from zero only in a small region of @xmath16 , and it can be used as an expansion parameter .",
    "the mean value of the potential becomes : @xmath17    the cluster structure clearly shows up in the above equation .",
    "let s consider the term obtained retaining only the @xmath18 s in the expansion of @xmath19 .",
    "we obtain : @xmath20 which is the mean value of the potential between the uncorrelated states .",
    "if @xmath9 is a two  body potential @xmath21 the sum of all the terms linear in @xmath14 generates two  body cluster diagrams @xmath22 and three or four  body cluster diagrams of the form : @xmath23 the three ",
    "body diagrams are obtained when either @xmath12 or @xmath13 is equal to @xmath18 or @xmath24 and the other index is different , while in the four  body diagrams both @xmath12 and @xmath13 are different from @xmath18 and @xmath24 . summing all the terms quadratic in the @xmath14 functions , @xmath25 three , four , five and six ",
    "body cluster diagrams are obtained .",
    "the procedure continues considering all the terms given by eq .",
    "[ cluster ] .",
    "a similar expansion can be derived for the kinetic energy mean value .",
    "the analysis of the cluster expansion is done in a more efficient way using the so  called mayer diagrams @xcite . from this analysis",
    "it turns out that the mean value of the hamiltonian between the two correlated states can be expressed simply in terms of two classes of diagrams : the nodal diagrams and the elementary , or bridge , diagrams ( see references @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the fermi hypernetted chain ( fhnc ) provides a set of integral equations which allows one to sum up all the nodal diagrams .",
    "there is not closed form to do the same for the elementary diagrams .",
    "they should be calculated one by one like in ordinary perturbation theories .    a usual approximation in this kind of calculations ,",
    "the so  called fhnc/0 approximation , consists in neglecting the elementary diagrams .",
    "it is worth to stress here that the fhnc/0 calculations differ from the monte carlo ones only by the fact that the elementary diagrams are not considered .",
    "the relevance of these diagrams has been studied in nuclear matter where it has been found that their contribution to the energy is small @xcite .",
    "this is not the case for other many - body systems , like liquid helium @xcite .",
    "our first goal was to test the validity of fhnc theory against vmc calculations @xcite .",
    "for this reason we have performed calculations in model nuclei using scalar correlation functions and semi - realistic interactions .",
    "our model nuclei are composed by protons and neutrons having the same radial single ",
    "particle wave functions , their angular momentum coupling is done in the @xmath26 scheme , and the coulomb interaction is switched off .",
    "the comparison between our results and the vmc ones are presented in tab.1 where , in addition to the binding energies @xmath27 , the contribution of the majorana @xmath28 and wigner @xmath29 terms of the potential and that of the kinetic energy @xmath30 are shown .",
    "the calculations have been performed using the brink and boeker b1 interaction @xcite and with harmonic oscillator single particle wave functions .",
    "the fhnc results are presented in the rows labelled fhnc/0 .",
    "we observe the fact that in @xmath31o the binding energies differ from the vmc results by a factor of about the 10% .",
    "more important was the fact that the spin sum rule , @xmath32 scheme , and with coulomb interaction . in this new situation",
    "we found that the @xmath33 coupling is generating , in the nuclei with unsaturated @xmath34 levels , a new statistical correlation .    in tab.2 .",
    "we present the results of calculations performed keeping fixed the woods - saxon mean  field which generates the single particle wave functions and changing the correlation function in order to minimise the binding energy .",
    "the interaction used is the s3 force of afnan and tang @xcite extended to consider the odd channels as described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the results of the column @xmath35 have been obtained using the same mean  field potential for protons and neutrons ( a woods - saxon well without spin  orbit term ) , switching off the coulomb interaction and the new statistical correlation .",
    "the effect of this new correlation can be seen comparing the results of column @xmath35 with those column @xmath36 .",
    "the only difference with the calculation of the @xmath35 column is just the inclusion of the new correlation terms .",
    "the effect of this new correlation is present only in the potential energy term of the @xmath37c , @xmath38ca and @xmath39pb nuclei which have some unsaturated @xmath34 shell , and it is rather small .",
    "the @xmath40 column presents the results obtained adding the coulomb interaction in the hamiltonian .",
    "the contribution of the nuclear interaction ( @xmath9 ) to the binding energy is about the same for @xmath8ca , @xmath38ca and @xmath39pb .",
    "this nuclei are sufficiently large to allow the nuclear interaction to _",
    "saturate_. on the other hand , the contribution of the coulomb interaction ( @xmath41 ) , because of the infinite range of the force , increases like the number of the protons pairs .",
    "the @xmath42 column shows the results obtained inserting the coulomb potential also in the mean  field .",
    "we have used the potential generated by a homogeneously charged sphere .",
    "other choices did not make any relevant difference .    instead of performing a full minimisation of the energy functional changing both the mean  field and the correlation function , we took from the literature woods  saxon potentials fixed in order to reproduce single particle energies around the fermi surface , and with these mean  fields we minimised the binding energies finding the optimal correlation functions for both the b1 and s3 interactions .",
    "the results of these calculations are presented in tab.3 and they show the same characteristics of those of tab.2 . the nuclear interaction _",
    "saturates _ for the heavier nuclei while the contribution of the coulomb interaction increases with the number of protons .",
    "it is interesting to compare the results obtained by the fhnc/0 calculations ( rows @xmath43 ) with those obtained including the elementary diagram ( rows @xmath44 ) .",
    "the contribution of the elementary diagram is noticeable in the lighter nuclei .",
    "in @xmath45 is of the order of the 10% and even more .",
    "as soon as the number of particles increases , the elementary diagram becomes less important . in @xmath39pb",
    "its contribution is of few parts on a thousand .",
    "this fact is in agreement with our experience of nuclear matter calculations where the elementary diagrams are irrelevant .",
    "an interesting feature of these calculations is shown in fig.1 where the optimal correlation functions are shown .",
    "the correlation functions seem to depend only from the interaction and not from the mean  field .",
    "the correlation functions obtained with the @xmath46 interaction have deeper minima than those obtained with the @xmath47 interaction .    in fig.2",
    "we compare the uncorrelated proton distribution ( full lines ) with those calculated with our theory using the @xmath47 and @xmath46 interactions ( dashed and dashed dotted lines respectively ) .",
    "the effect of the correlation on the distributions seems to be larger for the calculations done with the @xmath47 interaction than in the case of the @xmath46 interaction .",
    "it is remarkable the small effect shown on the @xmath39pb distribution .",
    "we found analogous effects on the neutrons distributions .    in fig.3",
    "we show the proton momentum distributions . in this figure",
    "the presence of short  range correlations shows up at high momentum value where the fhnc results are orders of magnitude bigger than the uncorrelated results .",
    "the differences between the calculations performed with the two interactions are small if compared with those with the uncorrelated momentum distribution .",
    "the cbf - fhnc theory presented above is a good approximation for the exact solution of the many - body schrdinger equation .",
    "a cbf basis may also be constructed , to be used in perturbation theory .",
    "this expansion is expected to have a fast convergence , since much of the non  perturbative physics , related to the short - range part of the nuclear potential , is already embedded in the basis itself .    unfortunately it is unrealistic to expect of being able to calculate in a short time the two - nucleon emission cross sections using this theory .",
    "the comparison with the experimental data produced in the next few years by the electron accelerators will be done through models .",
    "this theory is however a basis and/or a testing ground for these models .",
    "it is in this perspective that we have started to develop a simplified model of the theory .",
    "this model consists essentially in calculating only the cluster expansion terms with a single dynamical correlation line .",
    "the nice feature of this model is that , in spite of the relative simplicity with respect to the full theory , it satisfies the same set of sum rules of the full calculation .",
    "details of the model can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in fig.4",
    "we compare the proton density distribution obtained with our model ( dotted line ) , with that obtained performing the full fhnc calculation ( dashed line ) .",
    "the model is slightly emphasising the effect of the correlations .",
    "the relative simplicity of the model allows us to include easily the effect of the state dependent part of the correlation which are shown in fig.5 . in this figure",
    "the full line is the uncorrelated proton distribution and the other lines have been obtained including the various state dependent channels .",
    "the number from @xmath18 to @xmath48 are indicating the inclusion of each central channel @xmath49 and the @xmath50 and @xmath51 the isoscalar and isovector tensor channels@xcite .",
    "the lower panel shows the difference between uncorrelated and correlated distributions .",
    "we have recently extended our model to describe excited states . in fig.6",
    "we present the charge form factors for the discrete transitions @xmath52 in @xmath8ca and @xmath38ca .",
    "the dashed lines show the results obtained with the uncorrelated shell model , and the full lines the results obtained with our model .",
    "electron scattering experiments have , so far , investigated the one - body part of the nuclear many - body wave function . with the double coincidence experiments we shall start to investigate the two - body part of the nuclear wave function .",
    "the mean  field models , quite successful in describing the one  body observables , are inadequate to describe two - body properties of the nuclei .",
    "a profitable comparison between theory and experiment can not be obtained adding corrections to mean  field models fixed to reproduce one  body properties . this because in these models , part of the effects we want to investigate , those of the correlation , are already taken into account in an average way .",
    "a proper theoretical description of the nuclear two - body properties can be obtained only if one treats on the same ground mean - field , correlations and also final state interactions .",
    "the cbf - fhnc theory provides a theoretical framework to carry on this ambitious program .",
