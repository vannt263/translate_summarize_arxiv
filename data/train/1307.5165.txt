    "the most precise tests of non - magnetic spin - dependent interactions like ( i ) the lorentz invariance violating coupling of spins to a background field@xcite or ( ii ) the search for a p- and t - violating short - range interaction mediated by light , pseudo - scalar bosons ( axions)@xcite are often performed in experiments that compare the transition frequencies of two co - located systems ( clock comparison)@xcite .",
    "this type of experiment is only sensitive if the spin - dependent interaction in question is varying in time . in case of the search for a coupling of spins to a relic background field @xcite",
    ", the earth s daily rotation leads to a modulation of the orientation in space with the sidereal frequency .",
    "as the frequency of this modulation is unfavorably low , we developed a system to rotate the magnetic guiding field of our @xmath0he-@xmath1xe - comagnetometer ( @xmath3 ) in order to have a much more preferable modulation frequency that may help to get rid of the correlated errors which at present limit our overall sensitivity .",
    "inside the @xmath4-metal shielded room bmsr-2 at ptb , berlin , two square helmholtz coil pairs ( fixed perpendicular to each other ) are driven by low noise , high resolution current sources in order to provide the homogeneous magnetic field of about 400 nt .",
    "the stability of the current is @xmath5 , while the stability of the magnetic field is @xmath6 due to drifts of the @xmath4-metal shielding , measured by analyzing larmor frequency drifts . with this setup",
    "we can generate a guiding field , which points into any direction @xmath7 in the horizontal plane .",
    "besides the proof of principle that a coherent measurement of spin precession with a slowly rotating guiding field is possible ( i.e. , we do not lose the phase information ) , our results have an unexpected impact on the measurements with static guiding fields : the transverse relaxation time strongly depends on the direction of the magnetic guiding field and varies between 20 h and 100 h for helium ( fig .",
    "[ aba : fig1 ] ) , and between 6 h and 8.5 h for xenon . the characteristic pattern in fig .",
    "[ aba : fig1 ] for @xmath8 repeats itself after every revolution and is reproduced in all successive runs over a period of at least two weeks . for @xmath9 , the characteristic pattern is similar@xcite .",
    "this effect of `` incidental shimming''@xcite has the following explanation : the presence of magnetic field gradients across a sample cell causes an increased transverse relaxation rate .",
    "the origin of this relaxation mechanism is the loss of phase coherence . for a spherical sample cell of radius r",
    "the relaxation rate @xmath10 is @xcite @xmath11 with the guiding field pointing into the x - direction .",
    "@xmath12 is the gyromagnetic ratio and d is the diffusion coefficient of the gas .",
    "it is useful to measure at low fields in order to minimize the absolute field gradients , which are of order pt / cm inside bmsr-2 .",
    "there are two main sources of gradients : residual field gradients from the @xmath4-metal shielding and gradients produced by the helmholtz coils .",
    "the latter ones will change , as the magnetic guiding field is rotated . at some angle @xmath7 the gradients from the chamber and coils",
    "almost cancel each other and @xmath2 is maximized . at other angles",
    "the cancellation is less distinct with a minimum in @xmath2 at a field orientation where the gradients add up constructively .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that by rotating the magnetic guiding field by @xmath13 the transverse relaxation time goes from the global maximum to the global minimum .",
    "these results gave us the possibility to optimize @xmath2 and thus the observation time for the search for a lorentz violating coupling of spins to a hypothetical background field . in our present experiments",
    "coherent spin precession can be monitored for more than 24 hours ( @xmath14)@xcite .",
    "longer observation times @xmath15 cause a higher sensitivity in frequency measurement ( @xmath16 ) according to the cramer - rao lower bound @xcite and , furthermore , greatly reduce the correlated errors , especially if runs of coherent spin precession are substantially longer than the period of a sidereal day.@xcite    xx v.a .",
