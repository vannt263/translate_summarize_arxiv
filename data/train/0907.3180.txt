    "the cosmological constant problem is one of the most important and deepest problem in theoretical physics . in the seminal review",
    "@xcite weinberg points out that in order to solve this problem completely one need understand the following two puzzles .",
    "one is why the observed value of the cosmological constant is so small comparing with the theoretical value of the vacuum energy predicted by quantum field theory , and the second one is why the matter density and the dark energy density now observed have the same order , which is also dubbed as the coincidence problem .",
    "recently smolin elaborates the first puzzle into two questions , with one being qualitative and the other quantitative@xcite .",
    "namely , why is the cosmological constant not of the order of planck mass ? and why is the observed value is @xmath1 after some cancelation from symmetry breaking .",
    "recently afshordi proposed an interesting program to solve the first cosmological constant problem by introducing a novel notion of gravitational aether@xcite . following the thermodynamical description of general relativity by jacobson@xcite , he conjectured that the usual source term in einstein s equation can be modified as @xmath2 .",
    "then to preserve the successful predictions of general relativity and the conversation of the total energy momentum tensor , or the bianchi identity , an additional term @xmath3 is needed on the right hand side of the equation , representing the existence of some sort of gravitational aether .",
    "one remarkable result derived from this modification is that the vacuum energy can be decoupled at appropriate scale .",
    "previously another approach to degravitate the vacuum energy has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "however , when degravitating the vacuum energy from the source , the framework of gravitational aether at the same time puts an upper bound on the ratio of two effective newton s constant for pressureless dust and radiation , which is @xmath4 . in the original paper @xcite by afshordi , it is argued that this ratio would be preferred by the current observation data , for instance from the combination of @xmath5 forest and cmb observation@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we think this constraint is far from robust , and as the author noticed , this is a controversial result if comparing it with the result from big bang nucleosynthesis@xcite , which is given as @xmath6@xcite .",
    "in particular the latter one is a widely admitted and used quantity by most theoretical physicists and cosmological community .",
    "furthermore , in this framework it is possible to match the data only under the condition that the state parameter of the gravitational aether is very large , namely @xmath7 , indicating it is forced to be a sort of incompressible fluid .",
    "though under some consideration a large value of the state parameter is desirable , we view this as another limitation on the nature of the gravitational aether . therefore in this paper",
    "we intend to loose the constraint on the ratio of effective newton s constants in this framework , and expect this improvement can provide more space for further tests so as to keep the consistency of this proposed framework with the observational data .    our key idea to improve this framework is to generalize the fluid characteristic of the gravitational aether .",
    "since it is still beyond the experimental tests , treating the gravitational aether as a perfect fluid is only an assumption for simplicity . in this paper we propose that the gravitational aether may be treated as a fluid with viscosity .",
    "it turns out that this treatment will greatly change the form of the effective newton s constant , and thus provide a mechanism to adjust the ratio of the newton s constants for matter and radiation .",
    "we organize our paper as follows . in next section",
    "we briefly review the key ideas and results for an ideal gravitational aether and see how it can degravitate the vacuum energy from gravity .",
    "then we present our scheme to treat the aether as a viscous fluid in section three , focusing on the possibility of adjusting the ratio of the effective newton s constants . in section four",
    "we demonstrate that this strategy can be extended to the case with multi - fluids . as a summary",
    ", we discuss some open questions and further possible improvement in section five .",
    "in this section we briefly review the approach proposed in @xcite which is supposed to solve the first cosmological constant problem . in this framework einstein equation in a spacetime with contents of common matter and gravitational aether",
    "is modified as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the ordinary energy - momentum tensor of matter and @xmath10 is its trace , while @xmath11 is the energy - momentum tensor of gravitational aether .",
    "adding such a term is to preserve the divergenceless of the right hand side of eq.([aaa ] ) , which means    @xmath12    since for the usual matter we have @xmath13 , the bianchi identity ( [ aab ] ) leads to @xmath14 which is a _ dynamical _ equation controlling the relations between the matter and the gravitational aether . consider the homogeneity of spacetime we may have @xmath15    in the flat frw metric with the signature @xmath16 , we consider the matter ingredient composed of an ideal fluid with a constant state parameter @xmath17 , thus @xmath18 . if one assumes that the gravitational aether is also a simple perfect fluid with an energy - momentum tensor as @xmath19,\\ ] ] then from eq.([aac ] ) we can derive @xmath20 where we have used @xmath21 and @xmath22 . equation ( [ aai ] ) plays a key role to degravitate the vacuum energy from gravity . to understand this we write down the cosmological equation from the modified einstein equation ( [ aaa ] ) , @xmath23 with an effective newton s constant @xmath24 substituting the solution to eq .",
    "( [ aai ] ) into above formula one finds that the effective newton s constant becomes @xmath25 where it is required that @xmath26 and @xmath27 in order to obtain the inhomogeneous solution@xcite .",
    "first of all , we notice that the effective newton s constant depends only on the state parameters of the gravitational aether and matter .",
    "in particular the energy density of aether @xmath28 plays no role in the final version of the modified cosmological equation .",
    "one remarkable result which can be read from eq.([aan ] ) is that the effective newton s constant would approach to zero whenever @xmath29 , indicating that the zero - point energy is decoupled from spacetime geometry , known as degravitation .",
    "however , the price this mechanism has to pay is that the ratio of the effective newton s constants are bounded for various contents of matter .",
    "specifically , for the cases of pressureless dust era and radiation era , one finds that @xmath30 which means the ratio of these two effective newton s constant has a maximal value which is @xmath0 , as the state parameter @xmath31 goes to infinity .",
    "this is a very strong constraint , although in some circumstances this upper bound still falls in a region allowed by recent observations and data analysis .",
    "is there any plausible mechanism to improve this situation ? this is what we intend to do in next section .",
    "our main idea is to generalize the fluid characteristic of gravitational aether , which is treated as a perfect fluid in previous section .",
    "however this is just an assumption .",
    "if the aether has a bulk viscosity , then its energy - momentum tensor is modified as @xmath32,\\ ] ] where the relation between the pressure and the energy density of the fluid is generalized to @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the scalar expansion which is proportional to the hubble parameter in the context of viscous cosmology , usually set as @xmath35 in comoving coordinates@xcite .",
    "@xmath36 is the bulk viscosity which in general is a function of energy densities of multi - fluids as well as their state parameters , and its specific forms can be found in literature , for instance @xcite .",
    "here we take one of them , setting @xmath37 where @xmath38 may be a function of state parameters @xmath17 and @xmath31 .",
    "then , with the use of the modified friedmann equation we can rewrite the pressure as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is independent of energy densities , but only a function of @xmath17 and @xmath31 which should be chosen . in this paper",
    "we consider one simple form with @xmath41 for the viscosity of the gravitational aether , where @xmath42 is just a dimensionless constant . as a result , the pressure has the following form    @xmath43    now , with the generalized energy - momentum tensor we turn to eq.([aai ] ) and find it is changed into @xmath44=\\frac{1}{4}(1 - 3\\omega)\\frac{d\\rho}{dt}.\\ ] ]    when both state parameters @xmath17 and @xmath31 are constants , we obtain a solution to this equation as @xmath45 we notice that the ratio between the energy densities of matter and aether keep constant .",
    "in contrast to the case of perfect aether , we find the ratio is not vanishing as @xmath46 , but approaching to @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "similar situation occurs for an ideal aether fluid , where the energy density of the aether has to be negative for @xmath49 and @xmath26 . ] . since the modification of energy - momentum tensor will not affect the relation between @xmath50 and @xmath51 , substituting eq.([ai ] ) into eq.([aaj ] )",
    "we obtain the effective newton s constant as @xmath52g'.\\ ] ] this is the main result in our paper , and several remarks are given as follows .    1 .",
    "first of all , viscous gravitational aether does provide a similar mechanism to degravitate the vacuum energy from gravity , as @xmath53 .",
    "2 .   in this case",
    "the ratio of the effective newton s constants for pressureless dust and radiation changes to the form @xmath54.\\ ] ] obviously when @xmath55,we go back to the case of ideal aether , i.e. @xmath56 .",
    "however , when @xmath57 , we find the ratio can be larger than @xmath58 .",
    "for instance , let @xmath59 , we have @xmath60 and @xmath61 therefore the ratio can be larger than @xmath58 whenever @xmath62 .",
    "in particular , when @xmath63 , the ratio is exactly equal to one , @xmath64 .",
    "in figure one we illustrate the variation of the ratio with the state parameter of the gravitational aether when @xmath42 takes various values .",
    "3 .   in above discussion",
    "we intend to lift the upper bound with an assumption that the aether is a kind of nearly incompressible fluid , namely @xmath65 . as a matter of fact , we may loose this constraint when the gravitational aether has a viscosity",
    ". we can choose a team of proper values for @xmath42 and @xmath31 to let @xmath64 .",
    "for instance , if we take @xmath66 , we find the ratio @xmath67 as @xmath68 , and the effective newton s constants are @xmath69 . alternatively , if @xmath70 , then @xmath67 as @xmath71 , and the effective newton s constants are @xmath72 . in figure two",
    "we illustrate the relation between @xmath73 and @xmath42 when setting @xmath64 , which is nothing but @xmath74",
    "in previous sections we discussed the effective newton s constants could be different for perfect fluids with different state parameters under the condition that the universe is filled with the gravitational aether and a single perfect fluid which is supposed to be dominating in different era of the universe . to make this proposal more practical we need consider the case that the gravitational aether is mixed with multi - fluids including all the ingredients of the universe .",
    "next we demonstrate that the analysis presented in previous sections can be extended to this case indeed . for simplicity",
    "we consider the gravitational aether is mixed with two perfect fluids , but all the derivations and results can be straightforwardly generalized to the case with multi - fluids .",
    "consider two perfect fluids with energy densities and constant state parameters @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively , we obtain the modified friedmann equation as    @xmath77    with two effective newton s constants which have the form @xmath78g'.\\ ] ]    at first we assume that the gravitational aether is a perfect fluid without viscosity . then from eq.([aac ] ) we can derive the equation which constrains the evolution of the gravitational aether and the fluids as @xmath79 to obtain a solution to this equation we firstly notice that from the conservation equations of fluids @xmath80 and @xmath81 , a relation between the energy densities of two fluids can be obtained @xmath82 substituting this into equation ( [ acm ] ) , we can solve for @xmath28 as a function of the energy density @xmath83 @xmath84 with @xmath85 now it is straightforward to obtain the effective newton s constants for these two fluids by substituting eq.([rhom ] ) into eq.([gef ] ) @xmath86 as a result , we show that the gravitational aether proposal can be generalized to the case with multi - fluids .",
    "in particular , the effective newton s constants have the same form as that for a single perfect fluid .",
    "when the viscosity of the gravitational aether is taken into account , we propose that the pressure of the aether is modified as @xmath87.\\ ] ] then with the same algebra we obtain the effective newton s constants for these two fluids as @xmath88g'\\nonumber\\\\         g^{eff}_2         & = & \\frac{1+\\omega_2}{\\omega'-\\omega_2}\\left [ \\frac{3}{4}(\\omega'-\\frac{1}{3})-\\beta\\omega'\\omega_2\\right]g'.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] they have the same form as that for a single fluid . therefore we conclude that our strategy is general and can be applicable to the case with multi - fluids .",
    "the notion of gravitational aether is introduced to solve the first cosmological constant problem . in this mechanism",
    "the effective newton s constant is matter dependent such that the vacuum energy can be decoupled from gravity , but the price is that the ratio of effective newton s constants for pressureless dust and radiation is bounded , no larger than @xmath0 . in this paper",
    "we proposed that this difficulty may be overcome by generalizing the ideal gravitational aether to the one with viscosity .",
    "moreover , the aether need not be a kind of incompressible fluid .    to obtain such effects",
    "we have taken a special form of the viscous term .",
    "in particular , it depends on the energy density of ordinary matter rather than that of the gravitational aether , which looks peculiar .",
    "it means that the viscosity is not an intrinsic property of the gravitational aether itself , but generated whenever the aether is mixed with matter fluids .",
    "although we may change its form into one proportional to the square of the hubble parameter through the friedmann equation , we think this form of viscosity calls for further understanding .",
    "to push the proposal of gravitational aether forward , we need do more , specially in the interpretation of current accelerating expansion of the universe and the proportion of the dark energy in contents of cosmological ingredients@xcite .",
    "since our strategy can be extended to the case with multi - fluids , the program along this direction is under progress and will be presented elsewhere .",
