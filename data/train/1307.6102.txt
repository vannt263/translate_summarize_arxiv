    "inventory management is of great economic importance to industry , but forecasting demand for spare parts is difficult because it is _ intermittent _ : in many time periods the demand is zero .",
    "various methods have been proposed for forecasting , some simple and others statistically sophisticated , but relatively little work has been done on intermittent demand .",
    "we now list the methods most relevant to this paper . _ single exponential smoothing _ ( ses ) generates estimates @xmath0 of the demand by exponentially weighting previous observations @xmath1 via the formula @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a _ smoothing parameter_. the smaller the value of @xmath4 the less weight is attached to the most recent observations .",
    "an up - to - date survey of exponential smoothing algorithms is given in @xcite .",
    "they perform remarkably well , often beating more complex approaches @xcite , but ses is known to perform poorly ( under some measures of accuracy ) on intermittent demand .",
    "a well - known method for handling intermittency is _",
    "croston s method _",
    "@xcite which applies ses to the demand sizes @xmath1 and intervals @xmath5 independently .",
    "given smoothed demand @xmath0 and smoothed interval @xmath6 at time @xmath7 , the forecast is @xmath8 both @xmath0 and @xmath6 are updated at each time @xmath7 for which @xmath9 .",
    "according to @xcite it is hard to conclude from the various studies that croston s method is successful , because the results depend on the data used and on how forecast errors are measured .",
    "but it is generally regarded as one of the best methods for intermittent series @xcite , and versions of the method are used in leading statistical forecasting software packages such as sap and forecast pro @xcite .    to remove at least some of the known bias of croston s method on stochastic intermittent demand ( in which demands occur randomly ) , a correction factor is introduced by syntetos & boylan @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the smoothing factor used for inter - demand intervals , which may be different to the @xmath4 smoothing factor used for demands . because it is used to smooth both @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "] this works well for intermittent demand but is incorrect for non - intermittent demand .",
    "this problem is cured by syntetos @xcite who uses a forecast @xmath14 this reduces bias on non - intermittent demand , but slightly increases forecast variance @xcite .",
    "another modified croston method is given by levn & segerstedt @xcite , who claim that it also removes the bias in the original method but in a simpler way : they apply ses to the ratio of demand size and interval length each time a nonzero demand occurs .",
    "that is , they update the forecast using @xmath15 however , this also turns out to be biased @xcite .",
    "a more recent development is the tsb ( teunter - syntetos - babai ) algorithm @xcite , which updates the demand probability instead of the demand interval .",
    "this allows it to solve the problem of _ obsolescence _ which was not previously dealt with in the literature .",
    "an item is considered obsolete if it has seen no demand for a long time .",
    "when many thousands of items are being handled automatically , this may go unnoticed by croston s method and its variants .",
    "one of the authors of this paper ( prestwich ) has worked with an inventory company who used croston s method , but were forced to resort to ad hoc rules such as : _ if an item has seen no demand for 2 years then forecast 0 .",
    "_ tsb is designed to overcome this problem . instead of a smoothed interval",
    "@xmath13 it uses exponential smoothing to estimate a probability @xmath16 where @xmath17 is 1 when demand occurs at time @xmath7 and 0 otherwise .",
    "different smoothing factors @xmath4 and @xmath11 are used for @xmath0 and @xmath16 respectively .",
    "@xmath16 is updated every period , while @xmath0 is only updated when demand occurs .",
    "the forecast is @xmath18    in this paper we shall use cr to denote the original method of croston , sba the variant of syntetos & boylan , sy that of syntetos , and tsb that of teunter , syntetos & babai .",
    "we explore a new variant of croston s method that is unbiased and handles obsolescence .",
    "its novelty is that during long periods of no demand its forecasts decay hyperbolically instead of exponentially ( as in tsb ) , a property that derives from bayesian inference .",
    "the new method is described in section [ method ] and evaluated in section [ experiments ] , and conclusions are summarised in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "this paper is an extended version of @xcite .",
    "we take a croston - style approach , separating demands into demand sizes @xmath19 and the inter - demand interval @xmath20 . as in most croston methods , when non - zero demand occurs the estimated demand size @xmath0 and inter - demand period @xmath6 are both exponentially smoothed , using factors @xmath4 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "the novelty of our method is what happens when there is no demand .",
    "suppose that at time @xmath7 , up to and including the last non - zero demand we have smoothed demand size @xmath0 and inter - demand period @xmath6 , and that we have observed @xmath20 consecutive periods without demand since the last non - zero demand .",
    "what should be our estimate of the probability that a demand will occur in the next period ?",
    "a similar question was addressed by laplace @xcite : given that the sun has risen @xmath21 times in the past , what is the probability that it will rise again tomorrow ?",
    "his solution was to add one to the count of each event ( the sun rising or not rising ) to avoid zero probabilities , and estimate the probability by counting the adjusted frequencies .",
    "so if we have observed @xmath21 sunrises and 0 non - sunrises , in the absence of any other knowledge we would estimate the probability of a non - sunrise tomorrow as @xmath22 .",
    "this is known as the _ rule of succession_. but he noted that , given any additional knowledge about sunrises , we should adjust this probability .",
    "these ideas are encapsulated in the modern _ pseudocount _ method which can be viewed as bayesian inference with a beta prior distribution .",
    "we base our discussion on a recent book @xcite ( chapter 7 ) that describes the technique we need in the context of bayesian classifiers .",
    "for the two possibilities @xmath23 and @xmath9 we add non - negative pseudocounts @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively to the actual counts @xmath26 and @xmath27 of observations . from the beta distribution hyperparameters , but we already use these symbols for smoothing factors . ]",
    "as well as addressing the problem of zero observations , pseudocounts allow us to express the relative importance of prior knowledge and new data when computing the posterior distribution . by bayes rule",
    "the posterior probability of a nonzero demand occurring is estimated by @xmath28 ( this is actually a conditional probability that depends on the recent observations and prior probabilities , but we follow @xcite and write @xmath29 for simplicity . ) in our problem we have seen no demand for @xmath20 periods so @xmath30 and @xmath31 : @xmath32 we can eliminate one of the pseudocounts by noting that the prior probability of a demand found by exponential smoothing is @xmath33 , and that the pseudocounts must reflect this : @xmath34 hence @xmath35 and @xmath36 as with tsb , to obtain a forecast we multiply this probability by the smoothed demand size : @xmath37 we can also eliminate @xmath25 by choosing a value that gives an unbiased forecaster on stochastic intermittent demand , as follows . consider the demand sequence as a sequence of substrings , each starting with a nonzero demand : for example the sequence @xmath38 has substrings @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 . within a substring @xmath0 and @xmath6 remain constant so our forecaster has expected forecast @xmath42 = \\mathbb{e}\\left [ \\frac{\\hat{y}_t}{\\hat{\\tau}_t } \\left ( \\frac{1}{1 + \\tau_t/ \\hat{\\tau}_tc_1 } \\right ) \\right ] \\approx   \\mathbb{e}\\left [ \\frac{\\hat{y}_t}{\\hat{\\tau}_t } \\left ( 1 - \\frac{\\tau_t } { \\hat{\\tau}_tc_1 } \\right ) \\right ] = \\frac{\\hat{y}_t}{\\hat{\\tau}_t } \\left(1- \\frac{1}{c_1}\\right)\\ ] ] the derivation used the linearity of expectation , the constancy of @xmath0 and @xmath6 , the fact that @xmath43=\\hat{\\tau}_t$ ] , and the approximation @xmath44 for small @xmath45 which can be found by taking the first two terms of geometric series @xmath46 . choosing @xmath47 , and therefore @xmath48 , we obtain a forecast @xmath49 with expected value @xmath50 which is identical to the actual sba forecast .",
    "so on any substring our forecaster has the same expected forecast as sba , given the same values of @xmath0 and @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , it updates @xmath0 and @xmath6 in exactly the same way as sba at the start of each substring , therefore it has the same expected forecast as sba over the entire demand sequence .",
    "thus by @xcite it is unbiased on stochastic intermittent demand .",
    "a drawback with this forecaster is that , like sba , it is biased on non - intermittent demand .",
    "this can be overcome by a slight adjustment to the forecast : @xmath51 following a similar derivation of the expected forecast : @xmath52 & = & \\mathbb{e}\\left [ \\frac{\\hat{y}_t}{\\hat{\\tau}_t } \\left ( \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{\\beta}{2\\hat{\\tau}_t}(\\tau_t -1 ) } \\right ) \\right]\\\\ & \\approx &   \\mathbb{e}\\left [ \\frac{\\hat{y}_t}{\\hat{\\tau}_t } \\left ( 1 - \\frac{\\beta}{2\\hat{\\tau}_t}(\\tau_t -1 ) \\right ) \\right]\\\\ & = & \\frac{\\hat{y}_t}{\\hat{\\tau}_t } \\left(1-",
    "\\frac{\\beta}{2}\\right ) \\left(1 + \\frac{\\beta}{2\\hat{\\tau}_t\\left(1- \\frac{\\beta}{2}\\right ) } \\right)\\\\ & \\approx & \\frac{\\hat{y}_t}{\\hat{\\tau}_t } \\left(1- \\frac{\\beta}{2}\\right ) \\left(1 + \\frac{\\beta}{2\\hat{\\tau}_t } \\right)\\\\ & \\approx & \\left(1- \\frac{\\beta}{2}\\right ) \\frac{\\hat{y}_t}{\\hat{\\tau}_t \\left(1 - \\frac{\\beta}{2\\hat{\\tau}_t } \\right)}\\\\ & = & \\left(1- \\frac{\\beta}{2}\\right ) \\frac{\\hat{y}_t}{\\hat{\\tau}_t - \\frac{\\beta}{2 } } \\end{array}\\ ] ] the final expression is exactly the forecast made by the sy method throughout the substring .",
    "but sy is unbiased on standard stochastic intermittent demand and also on non - intermittent demand @xcite , so ( using the same arguments as above ) our forecaster is too .",
    "this is the forecaster we shall use , and we call it hyperbolic - exponential smoothing ( he s ) because of its combination of exponential smoothing with hyperbolic decay .",
    "an illustration of the different behaviour of sy , tsb and he s is shown in figure [ pluseffect ] .",
    "demand is stochastic intermittent with probability 0.25 , all nonzero demands ( shown as impulses ) are 1 , and the forecasters use @xmath53 .",
    "on stochastic intermittent demand the he s forecasts are similar to those of sy , though there is some decay between demands .",
    "tsb also has greater variation , though this difference could be reduced by using smaller smoothing parameters .",
    "when demand becomes zero , for example because the item becomes obsolete , sy remains constant , tsb decays exponentially and he s decays hyperbolically .",
    "we now test he s empirically to evaluate its bias and forecasting accuracy . in all experiments , for cr , sba and sy we let @xmath54 as is usual with those methods .      in any comparison of forecasting methods we must choose accuracy measures .",
    "@xcite lists 17 measures , noting that a `` bewildering array of accuracy measures have been used to evaluate the performance of forecasting methods '' , that no single method is generally preferred , and that some are not well - defined on data with intermittent demand",
    ". we shall use measures that have been recently recommended for intermittent demand .",
    "to measure bias we use mase ( mean absolute scaled error ) , recommended by @xcite and defined as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a scaled error defined by @xmath57 @xmath58 is the error @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the time periods of the samples used for forecasting , which we take to be the @xmath61 samples used to initialise the smoothed estimates .",
    "we take these means over multiple runs .",
    "mase effectively evaluates a forecasting method against the _ naive _ ( or _ random walk _ ) forecaster , which simply forecasts that the next demand will be identical to the current demand .    as a measure of deviation we use the mad / mean ratio ( mmr ) , which has been argued to be superior to several other methods used in forecasting competitions @xcite and is defined by @xmath62 again the summations are taken over multiple runs .    as another measure of deviation",
    "we also use the relative root mean squared error , defined as rmse / rmse@xmath63 where rmse is measured on the method being evaluated and rmse@xmath63 on a baseline measure , both taken over multiple runs .",
    "when the baseline is random walk this is thiel s u2 statistic @xcite , and this is the baseline we use .",
    "the motivation behind using these two measures of deviation is that mmr is based on absolute errors while u2 is based on root mean squared errors ; the latter penalises outliers more than the former so any differences between them could be revealing .    for stationary demand experiments we shall also compare tsb and he s using two relative measures .",
    "firstly we use the relative geometric root mean squared error ( rgrmse ) of he s with respect to tsb , analysed by @xcite and defined in our case as the geometric mean of @xmath64 taken over all periods in multiple runs .",
    "rgrmse is also known as the geometric mean relative absolute error and was used by @xcite .",
    "@xcite recommends the use of such relative error - based measures , though they have the drawback of potentially infinite variance because the denominator can be arbitrarily small @xcite .",
    "secondly we use the percentage of times better ( pb ) , recommended by @xcite and defined as the percentage of times the absolute he s error is less than the absolute tsb error .",
    "we base our first experiments on those of teunter _",
    "_ @xcite in which demands occur with some probability in each period , hence inter - demand intervals are distributed geometrically , and we use a logarithmic distribution for demand sizes . geometrically distributed intervals are a discrete version of poisson intervals , and the combination of poisson intervals and logarithmic demand sizes yields a negative binomial distribution , for which there is theoretical and empirical evidence : see for example the recent discussion in @xcite .",
    "teunter _ et al .",
    "_ compare several forecasters on demand that is nonzero with probability @xmath65 where @xmath65 is either 0.2 or 0.5 , and whose size is logarithmically distributed .",
    "the logarithmic distribution is characterised by a parameter @xmath66 and is discrete with @xmath67= - \\ell^k / k \\log(1- \\ell)$ ] for @xmath68 .",
    "they use two values : @xmath69 to simulate low demand and @xmath70 to simulate lumpy demand .",
    "they use @xmath4 values 0.1 , 0.2 and 0.3 , and @xmath11 values 0.01 , 0.02 , 0.03 , 0.04 , 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 .",
    "we add sy and he s to these experiments , but we drop ses as they found it to have large errors .",
    "they take mean results over 10 runs , each with 120 time periods , whereas we use 100 runs .",
    "they initialise each forecaster with `` correct '' values whereas we initialise with arbitrary values @xmath71 then run them for @xmath61 periods using demand probability @xmath65 . a final difference",
    "is that instead of mean error and mean squared error we use mase and mmr / u2 respectively .",
    "the results are shown in tables [ sta1][sta4 ] .",
    "because cr , sba and sy use only one smoothing factor @xmath4 we do not show their results for cases in which @xmath72 .",
    "comparing mase best - cases in each table , tsb and sy are least biased , closely followed by he s , then cr and sba . comparing mmr best - cases , sba is best , followed by tsb and he s , then cr and sy . comparing u2 best - cases he s is always at least as good as tsb , though there is little difference . comparing mmr - worst cases ,",
    "neither tsb nor he s dominates the other though he s seems slightly better .",
    "again sba gives best results , cr and sy generally the worst .",
    "comparing u2-worst cases he s beats tsb and seems to be more robust under different smoothing factors .",
    "sba again gives best results , while cr and sy have variable performance .    to examine the relative best - case performance of he s and tsb more closely , table [ logcomp ] compares tsb and he s using rgrmse and pb . to make this comparison we must choose smoothing factors @xmath73 for both methods ,",
    "and we do this in two different ways : those giving the best mmr results and those giving the best u2 results .",
    "the table also shows the best factors , denoted by @xmath74 . using the mmr - best factors he s performs rather less well than tsb on lumpy demand , under both rgrmse and pb . but",
    "using u2-best factors there is little difference between the methods .",
    "the table also shows that to optimise u2 we should use small factors for both tsb and he s , but to optimise mmr the best factors depend on the form of the demand .",
    "another demand distribution that has recieved interest , and for which there is also theoretical and empirical support , is the stuttering poisson distribution @xcite in which demand intervals are poisson and demand sizes are geometrically distributed .",
    "again we use a discrete version with geometrically distributed intervals .",
    "the geometric distribution is characterised by a probability we shall denote by @xmath75 , and is discrete with @xmath67=(1-g)^{k-1}g$ ] for @xmath76 .",
    "we use two values of @xmath75 : 0.2 and 0.8 to simulate low and lumpy demand respectively .",
    "otherwise the experiments are as in section [ biasstoch2 ] .",
    "the results are shown in tables [ stu1][stu4 ] .",
    "though the numbers are different , qualitatively the tsb and he s results are the same as for logarithmic demand sizes . however , cr , sba and sy now give similar results to each other , and sba no longer has the best best - case u2 result , though it still has the best worst - case u2 result .",
    "table [ geocomp ] compares tsb and he s using the rgrmse and pb measures .",
    "qualitatively the results are the same as with logarithmic demand sizes , except that he s is now worse than tsb in all 4 tables for mmr best - cases  though there is still little difference between the u2-best cases .",
    "the experiments so far use stationary demand , but teunter _ et al . _",
    "also consider nonstationary demand .",
    "again demand sizes follow the logarithmic distribution , while the probability of a nonzero demand decreases linearly from @xmath65 in the first period to 0 during the last period .",
    "demand sizes are again logarithmically distributed . as pointed out by teunter _",
    "et al . _ , none of the forecasters use trending to model the decreasing demand so all are positively biased .",
    "the results are shown in tables [ dec1][dec4 ] .",
    "tsb clearly has the best best - case mase , mmr and u2 results , while he s is next - best , though sba occasionally beats he s .",
    "he s has the worst worst - case mase , mmr and u2 results , followed by tsb .",
    "however , if we only consider he s and tsb results for which @xmath77 then cr , sba and sy have the worst worst - cases , with he s also poor on lumpy demand .",
    "the best @xmath11 for all methods is larger : as pointed out by teunter _",
    ", large smoothing factors are best at handling non - stationary demand , while small factors are best when demand is stationary .",
    "the best @xmath4 value is relatively unimportant here , which makes sense as demand sizes are stationary .",
    "we repeat the experiments of section [ decreasing ] , but instead of linearly decreasing the probability of demand we reduce it immediately to 0 after half ( 60 ) of the periods , again following teunter _",
    "_ demand sizes are again logarithmically distributed .",
    "the results are shown in tables [ obs1][obs4 ] . as found by teunter _",
    "the differences between tsb and cr , sba and sy are more pronounced because the latter are given no opportunity to adjust to the change in demand pattern .",
    "the results are qualitatively similar to those for decreasing demand , but with greater differences .",
    "it is noted in @xcite that although tsb is unbiased in the above sense , it is biased if we only compare forecasts with expected demand at issue points only ( that is when demand occurs ) .",
    "ses is similarly biased , but not croston methods such as sba or sy .",
    "the cause is the decay in forecast size between demands , and he s will clearly suffer from a similar bias .",
    "we repeated the stationary demand experiments with logarithmically and geometrically distributed demand sizes , and measured the bias of tsb and he s based on issue points only .",
    "both had greater bias than sy ( as expected ) but neither dominated the other .      on stationary demand",
    "sba performs very well , followed by tsb and he s .",
    "the relative performance of he s and tsb depends on how they are tuned .",
    "if we tune them using mmr then tsb beats he s under both the rgrmse and pb measures , but the best smoothing factors are erratic ; while if we tune them using u2 there is no significant difference between them , and the best smoothing factors are small . we prefer to take the u2-based results , not because they are better for our method but because they are more consistent with other work : teunter _ et al .",
    "_ found that small smoothing factors are best for stationary demand , though admittedly this could simply be because they used another ( unscaled ) mean squared error measure .",
    "intuitively this makes sense , whereas using mmr we found no consistent results for the best smoothing factors .",
    "@xcite also recommend tuning by u2 .",
    "thus we recommend tuning forecasting methods using u2 rather than mmr , and when doing this small smoothing factors are best for stationary demand .",
    "under these conditions tsb and he s seem to be equally good under two different measures , though they are slightly beaten by sba .",
    "he s is more robust than tsb under changes to the smoothing factors , with better worst - case behaviour as measured by both mmr and u2 .",
    "we believe that this is because he s s hyperbolic decay between demands is slower than tsb s exponential decay , so large smoothing factors are less harmful .",
    "but on non - stationary demand , with intervals increasing linearly or abruptly , tsb is best followed by he s , with cr , sba and sy giving worse performance if we consider the same range of smoothing factor settings . here",
    "tsb s greater reactivity serves it well . as found by other researchers , and as is intuitively clear , large smoothing factors are best at handling changes in demand pattern",
    "however , he s s robustness means that we can recommend smoothing factors that behave reasonably well on both stationary and non - stationary demand : @xmath78 .",
    "the results in all cases are not much worse than with optimally - tuned factors .",
    "we presented a new forecasting method called hyperbolic - exponential smoothing ( he s ) , which is based on an application of bayesian inference when no demand occurs .",
    "we showed theoretically that he s is approximately unbiased , and compared it empirically with croston variants cr , sba , sy and tsb . on stationary demand we found little difference between tsb and he s , though he s was more robust under changes to smoothing factors , and both performed well against other croston methods . on non - stationary demand tsb",
    "performed best , followed by he s .",
    "like tsb , he s has two smoothing factors @xmath4 and @xmath11 . in common with other methods ,",
    "he s performs best on stationary demand with small smoothing factors , and best on non - stationary demand with larger factors . using smoothing factors @xmath78 gave reasonable results on a variety of demand patterns and we recommend these values .",

    "<S> we describe a new hybrid of croston s method and bayesian inference called hyperbolic - exponential smoothing , which is unbiased on non - intermittent and stochastic intermittent demand , decays hyperbolically when obsolescence occurs and performs well in experiments . </S>"
