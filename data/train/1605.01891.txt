    "the accuracy of experiments testing the quantum properties of larger and larger systems is improving at a fast pace .",
    "quantum superpositions have been directly observed in a large variety of mesoscopic systems , ranging from atoms  @xcite to macro - molecules  @xcite , and optomechanics promises to reach much larger masses  @xcite .",
    "this is interesting and important , since it helps answering the question whether the quantum superposition principle , the building block of the theory , holds also at large scales , or breaks down at some point .",
    "moreover , as most quantum technologies rely on the superposition principle being applicable to arbitrarily complex systems , assessing its validity will impact the future directions of technological research .",
    "on the theoretical side , collapse models  @xcite take into account , in a quantitative way , the possibility of a progressive breakdown of quantum linearity when the size and complexity of the system increase .",
    "more than this , strong arguments  @xcite show that they are the only possible way of modifying quantum theory , taking into account such a breakdown . therefore , testing these models serve as a benchmark for any test of the superposition principle .    according to collapse models ,",
    "material particles interact with an external classical noise , which induces the collapse of the wave function .",
    "the effect is negligible for microscopic systems but , as it scales with the number of particles , macroscopic objects are always well - localised in space .",
    "the most complete and well studied model is the continuous spontaneous localization ( csl ) model  @xcite , which we will consider in this article together with its non - markovian ( ccsl )  @xcite and dissipative ( dcsl )  @xcite extensions .",
    "the csl model contains two new parameters : @xmath3 , which sets the strength of the interaction with the collapse noise , and @xmath2 , which defines the resolution of the collapse process . as for the dcsl model",
    ", a third parameter @xmath4 , related to the temperature @xmath5 of the collapse noise , is introduced . in the ccsl model instead , the third new parameter is the cut - off frequency @xmath6 , which controls the noise spectrum .",
    "setting a bound on @xmath3 and @xmath2 ( and on @xmath5 for dcsl model , and @xmath6 for the ccsl model ) is one of the outputs of experimental tests of the quantum superposition principle .    in the literature , the following values for @xmath3 and @xmath2 have been suggested . according to ghirardi , rimini and weber  @xcite , @xmath7 m and @xmath8 s@xmath9 .",
    "these values come from the requirement that macroscopic objects must alway be well localized . in  @xcite , slightly different values were proposed : @xmath7 m and @xmath10 s@xmath9 .",
    "adler , on the other hand , suggested stronger values : @xmath7 m and @xmath11 s@xmath9 and @xmath12 m and @xmath13 s@xmath9 , as a result of the analysis of the process of latent image formation in photography  @xcite .",
    "with reference to the dcsl model , if the collapse noise is associated to some cosmological field , a reasonable value of the temperature of the noise field is @xmath14 k. for the ccsl model , a reasonable cosmological value for the frequency cut - off is @xmath15 hz  @xcite .",
    "upper bounds on the collapse parameters are set by experiments .",
    "the direct way of testing them is through interferometric experiments .",
    "the best limits of this kind come from matter - wave interferometry performed by arndt s group  @xcite , which are reported in fig .",
    "[ exc_csl ] .",
    "more recently , non interferometric experiments have been pushed forward  @xcite .",
    "they all aim at testing a side - effect of the collapse noise : the brownian motion it induces on the dynamics of any system .",
    "two experimental scenarios of this kind are relevant : cantilevers  @xcite , where the brownian motion shows up as a violation of the equipartition theorem ( an anomalous heating ) , and x - ray detection  @xcite , where the brownian motion induces spontaneous photon emission from matter .",
    "the relevant bounds are again reported in fig .  [ exc_csl ] .    a recent experiment  @xcite succeeded in cooling a cloud of @xmath16rb atoms down to pk .",
    "this serves as a further test of collapse models , as we will see .",
    "the authors of  @xcite analyzed the spontaneous heating induced by a classical stochastic force acting on the cloud  @xcite , and set a bound on the heating rate , due to the stochastic diffusion , equal to @xmath17 pk / s .",
    "aim of this article is to perform an exact calculation of the predictions of the csl model for the experiment considered in  @xcite , and compare these predictions with the experimental data .",
    "we will set bounds on @xmath3 and @xmath2 of csl ( as well as on @xmath5 of dcsl and @xmath6 of ccsl ) .",
    "in the case of dcsl we will see that there exist values of @xmath5 such that the noise cools the system , not heat it .    instead of computing the change in the energy due to the collapse noise as done in  @xcite",
    ", we will compute the change of the variance in position of the cloud , which is the quantity measured in the experiment .",
    "the associated bounds are reported in figs . 6 and 7 .",
    "as we will see , these bounds are the strongest in a significant region of the parameter space , as we will discuss in section iv .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the experimental setup of  @xcite . in section iii",
    "we compute the theoretical predictions according to the csl model . in sections",
    "iv and v we study , respectively , the predictions of the non - white and of the dissipative extensions of the csl model .",
    "finally , in section vi we compare the theoretical predictions with the experimental results , and we derive the upper bounds on the collapse parameters .",
    "a gas of @xmath16rb atoms is cooled down to very low temperatures ( @xmath18 pk ) by using a  delta - kick \" technique .",
    "all the relevant experimental data are summarized in fig .",
    "[ prima ] .",
    "the gas is initially ( t=0 ) trapped by a harmonic potential with standard deviation in position equal to @xmath19 m .",
    "the cooling process comprises the following three steps :    _ step 1 _ : the harmonic trap is removed and the gas evolves freely for a relatively long time , @xmath20 s. this allows atoms with the same average momentum to be approximatively at the same distance from the initial localized state of the gas .",
    "_ step 2 _ : delta - kick .",
    "a gaussian laser beam interacts with the atoms , the laser - atom interaction being modeled by an external harmonic potential . by choosing the proper harmonic frequency and interaction time",
    ", the potential reduces the kinetic energy of the atoms .",
    "the interaction lasts for a short time , @xmath21 ms .",
    "_ step 3 _ : the gas evolves again freely for a relatively long time , @xmath22 s. the position variance of the gas is then measured , from which the temperature of the gas is inferred .",
    "the delta - kick frequency @xmath23 plays a critical role in the analysis .",
    "an estimation of @xmath23 is given in eq .",
    "( 103 ) of  @xcite through a classical calculation .",
    "if the initial position and velocity of the atoms are uncorrelated , the frequency becomes : @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 ms is the time when the gas reaches the minimum spread in position ( obtained in  @xcite through a fit of the experimental data ) .",
    "inserting all numerical values , we obtain : @xmath27 rad / s .    as a confirmation of this prediction",
    ", we verified that , for all the values of @xmath23 outside the range 6 - 7 rad / s , the predicted increase of the variance @xmath28 is in contradiction with the experimental data even for @xmath29 , i.e. even for ordinary quantum mechanics .",
    "therefore , @xmath23 should lay within that interval . then , we divided the interval 6 - 7 rad / s in ten parts , and computed which of the ten values of @xmath23 gives the weakest bounds on @xmath3 and @xmath2 ; the result is @xmath30 rad / s .",
    "since we can not estimate the error associated to @xmath23 , we take a conservative attitude , and choose this value for the following calculations .    in fig .",
    "@xmath31 of  @xcite , the experimental data are shown .",
    "however , the only experimental value , explicitly reported together with error - bars , is the minimum value of the position standard deviation , @xmath32 m , detected at delta - kick time of @xmath33 ms , and shown in the inset of our fig .",
