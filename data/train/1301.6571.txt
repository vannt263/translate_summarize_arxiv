    "the development of sustainable energy solutions based on scalable processes and non - toxic materials constitutes a key priority in the current scientific research agenda , and in this area nanostructured energy - harvesting solar and thermoelectric devices are playing a lead role .",
    "recently there has been a surge of interest in devices using semiconducting metal chalcogenides of the stibnite family .",
    "for example recent studies have demonstrated the potential of these semiconductors both in photovoltaics applications,@xcite and in thermoelectric generators.@xcite    in the area of nanostructured photovoltaics semiconducting metal chalcogenides have successfully been used to replace the inorganic dye in dye - sensitized solar cells,@xcite leading to the development of solid - state semiconductor - sensitized solar cells.@xcite in these devices thin layers or nanoparticles of the semiconducting chalcogenides act as light absorbers , and upon photoexcitation they transfer an electron to the acceptor ( typically tio@xmath0 ) and a hole to the hole - transporter ( for example a conducting polymer ) .",
    "the record efficiency within this class of devices is 5.1% and was obtained using stibnite ( sb@xmath0s@xmath1 ) as semiconductor sensitizer.@xcite    a recent atomistic computational study of photovoltaic interfaces for semicondictor - sensitized solar cells pointed out that , in addition to stibnite , the other members of the stibnite mineral family , namely antimonselite ( sb@xmath0se@xmath1 ) , bismuthinite ( bi@xmath0s@xmath1 ) , and guanajuatite ( bi@xmath0se@xmath1 ) , exhibit optical properties similar to stibnite and should be considered as potential candidates for novel semiconductor sensitizers.@xcite using density - functional calculations and empirical scissor corrections of the band gaps , in ref .",
    "it was found that stibnite and antimonselite should form type - ii heterojunctions with tio@xmath0 , while bismuthinite should form a type - i heterojunction and hence would not be able to transfer electrons to tio@xmath0 .",
    "these theoretical predictions have recently been confirmed by the experimental investigations of refs .  , thereby providing a motivation for further studies and for the more sophisticated analysis presented in this work .",
    "the four minerals of the stibnite family crystallize in an orthorhombic structure consisting of parallel one - dimensional ( a@xmath4b@xmath5)@xmath6 ribbons , with a = sb , bi and b = s , se . a ball - and - stick model of this structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cryst ] . besides its natural occurrence in mineral form",
    ", stibnite can be synthesised using a variety of low - cost fabrication techniques.@xcite using these techniques it is possible to obtain a good degree of crystallinity,@xcite to control dimensionality,@xcite and to tune the optical properties.@xcite    b@xmath1 semiconducting metal chalcogenides of the stibnite family , with a standing for sb or bi ( brown ) , and b for s or se ( yellow ) .",
    "the two inequivalent ( a@xmath4b@xmath5)@xmath6 ribbons in the unit cell are highlighted in red , and the perspective view is along the direction of the ribbons . ]    semiconductors of the stibnite family have also been synthesized in various nanostructured forms .",
    "for example refs .   and refs .",
    "reported nanowires and nanotubes , respectively , of stibnite , antimonselite and bismuthinite .",
    "nanowires of stibnite were found to exhibit enhanced ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties as compared to their bulk counterpart.@xcite nanowires and nanotubes of antimonselite were found to exhibit conductivities much higher than their bulk counterpart,@xcite and are being considered for thermoelectric applications . in the case of bismuthinite ,",
    "ref .   reported nanowires with diameters as small as 1.6  nm , corresponding to a transverse size of only two ribbons .",
    "the rhombohedral phase of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 has been investigated extensively since this compound is a prototypical topological insulator.@xcite however to the best of our knowledge little is known about orthorhombic bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , i.e.  guanajuatite , which is stable only at high temperature and pressure.@xcite    the band gaps of stibnite , antimonselite and bismuthinite have been measured extensively via optical absorption experiments .",
    "the band gap of stibnite ranges between 1.42 - 1.78  ev.@xcite for antimonselite ref .   reported a direct gap of 1.55  ev , while ref .   gave an indirect gap between 1 - 1.2  ev .",
    "the measured band gap of bismuthinite is 1.38 - 1.58  ev.@xcite the spread in the measured gaps can be attributed to the different preparation conditions used , yielding different degrees of polycrystallinity and even amorphous samples in some cases , and also different stoichiometries .",
    "in addition all these compounds exhibit closely lying direct and indirect transitions ( cf .",
    "[ fig : bandstruct ] below ) , thereby complicating the assignment of the nature of the optical gap .",
    "all four minerals of the stibnite family have been investigated in detail using density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations .",
    "the electronic properties of these compounds have been studied in refs .  , and",
    "the elastic and optical properties have been calculated in ref .  .",
    "a comparison of the theoretical studies published so far shows some inconsistencies in the calculated band gaps , for example the values reported for stibnite are in the range 1.18 - 1.55  ev.@xcite as expected all the calculated dft gaps underestimate the measured band gaps . to the best of our knowledge",
    "only one work@xcite reported a calculation of the quasiparticle band gap of stibnite and antimonselite within the gw approximation.@xcite the electronic structure of the rhombohedral bi@xmath0se@xmath1 has also been explored within the gw approach @xcite .    within this context there",
    "exists a need for detailed and reproducible calculations of the electronic structure of stibnite and related compounds based on state - of - the - art quasiparticle techniques . in line with this need the goal of the present work is to report a systematic and reproducible study of the quasiparticle band structures of all four a@xmath0b@xmath1 semiconducting metal chalcogenides of the stibnite family .",
    "an emphasis is placed on convergence tests and on the sensitivity of the quasiparticle corrections to the structural parameters , the inclusion of semicore @xmath3 states in the calculations , and relativistic effects .",
    "our calculated band gaps are 1.5 ev ( sb@xmath0s@xmath1 ) , 1.3 ev ( sb@xmath0se@xmath1 ) , 1.4 ev ( bi@xmath0s@xmath1 ) and 0.9 ev ( bi@xmath0se@xmath1 ) . by inspection of the band structures we infer that all four compounds have direct band gaps ,",
    "although in most cases an indirect transition just below the direct gap ( within 0.1  ev ) is also possible .",
    "the inclusion of semicore electrons in the calculations is found to modify the band gaps by 0.1 - 0.2  ev .",
    "in addition we find that the gaps are rather sensitive to the lattice parameters , as they change by up to 0.3  ev when the lattice parameters are taken from experiment or fully optimized within dft .",
    "relativistic corrections are found to be essentially negligible for sb@xmath0s@xmath1 and sb@xmath0se@xmath1 , while in the case of bi@xmath0s@xmath1 and bi@xmath0se@xmath1 the band gaps decrease by 0.3 - 0.4  ev upon inclusion of spin - orbit coupling .",

    "the structural parameters were measured by refs .   and are reported in ref .  .",
    "as the crystal structure consists of a bundle of relatively well separated ribbons , it is convenient to separate the cohesive energy into intra - ribbon and inter - ribbon components .",
    "the intra - ribbon cohesive energy is calculated as the difference between the total energy of one ribbon and the total energies of its consituent atoms .",
    "the inter - ribbon cohesive energy is evaluated as the difference between the total energy of the unit cell and twice the total energy of one ribbon in isolation ( each unit cell contains two ribbons ) .",
    "we calculate the quasiparticle energies within many - body perturbation theory using the gw method,@xcite as implemented in the ` sax ` code.@xcite the gw self - energy is evaluated in the g@xmath2w@xmath2 approximation as @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath16 denotes the electron green s function defined by the kohn - sham eigenstates @xmath17 and eigenvalues @xmath18 corresponding to the band index @xmath19 and the wavevector @xmath20 , and @xmath21 represents the screened coulomb interaction calculated in the random phase approximation.@xcite the quasiparticle energies @xmath22 are obtained as:@xcite @xmath23 where @xmath22 is the quasiparticle energy , @xmath24 the associated quasiparticle renormalization , and @xmath25 is the exchange and correlation potential .    the self - energy can be written as the sum of a bare exchange contribution @xmath26 and a correlation contribution @xmath27 : @xmath28 .",
    "the exchange part does not depend explicitly on the excitation energy and reads:@xcite @xmath29 where the sum is over occupied states and @xmath30 represents the bare coulomb interaction .",
    "this contribution to the quasiparticle correction is sensitive to the overlap between kohn - sham wavefunctions regardless of their energy . as a result",
    "the use of semicore states can have significant effect on the calculations , as shown in refs .  .",
    "this aspect will be discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec.qp-corrections ] .",
    "the energy - dependence of the correlation contribution @xmath27 arising from the dynamically - screened coulomb interaction is described via the godby - needs plasmon - pole model.@xcite we use a plasmon - pole energy of 1 ry for all materials , similar to the energy of the peaks in the calculated electron energy loss spectra .",
    "since the computational efforts for achieving convergence in @xmath27 and @xmath26 are very different owing to the necessity of evaluating unoccupied states for @xmath27 , we perform separate convergence tests for these two components . for the exchange contribution we use kinetic energy cutoffs of 75  ry and 100  ry for calculations without and with semicore electrons , respectively . for the correlation contribution",
    "we perform convergence tests by calculating the band gap at various kinetic energy cutoffs up to 7  ry for the polarizability .",
    "figure  [ fig : conv](a ) shows that the band gap is converged within 0.05  ev already for a cutoff of 5  ry .",
    "the dependence of the band gap on the polarizability cutoff shows the same trend for calculations with or without semicore states .",
    "this is consistent with the expectation that the effect of semicore states in @xmath27 should be small.@xcite based on the data of fig .",
    "[ fig : conv](a ) , in the following we use a polarizability cutoff of 7  ry for calculations without semicore electrons , and of 6  ry for the more demanding calculations including semicore states . in fig .",
    "[ fig : conv](b ) we show the convergence of the band gap of antimonselite with respect to the energy of the highest unoccupied state included in the polarizability .",
    "based on the trend in this figure we set the number of unoccupied states to 224 and 264 for calculations with and without semicore , corresponding to a maximum energy denominator of 35  ev .",
    "both @xmath16 and @xmath21 are calculated on uniform and @xmath14-centered 2@xmath136@xmath132 brillouin - zone meshes .        in order to estimate the accuracy of our quasiparticle corrections with respect to the above convergence parameters we follow the approach of ref .  .",
    "in this approach the dependence of the band gap on a given convergence parameter is fitted by a simple function in order to extract a `` best - guess '' asymptotic limit .",
    "this asymptotic limit is then taken to represent the converged gap . in this work",
    "we tentatively approximate gap vs.  cutoff curves using the following function : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the quasiparticle band gap , @xmath33 is the convergence parameter ( i.e.  the polarizability cutoff or the largest energy denominator ) and @xmath34 are fitting parameters .",
    "while eq .",
    "( [ eq : fit ] ) is largely arbitrary , this choice reflects the expectation that the gap will converge faster than @xmath35 owing to the damping introduced by the matrix elements in the adler - wiser polarizability.@xcite figure  [ fig : conv ] shows that the fitting curves obtained for stibnite describe rather accurately the calculated data points , therefore it is reasonable to assume that the parameter @xmath36 obtained from the fit should provide a good estimate of the converged gap . by repeating this procedure for all four compounds sb@xmath0s@xmath1 , sb@xmath0se@xmath1 , bi@xmath0s@xmath1 , and bi@xmath0se@xmath1",
    "we find that the convergence parameters described above yield band gaps which differ by less than 0.05  ev from the corresponding asymptotic values .",
    "owing to the high atomic numbers of bi and sb , it is important to check the role of spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in the electronic structure of semiconductors of the stibnite family . in this work",
    "we evaluate soc effects at the dft level , by constructing a set of fully - relativistic troullier - martins pseudopotentials including semicore @xmath3 states .",
    "the pseudopotentials are generated using the `",
    "ld1.x ` program of the ` quantum espresso ` package .",
    "we checked that the planewaves cutoffs described in sec .",
    "[ sec.dft ] for scalar - relativistic calculations are also appropriate for these fully - relativistic pseudopotentials . for s and se relativistic effects",
    "are not expected to be significant , and scalar - relativistic pseudopotentials are used throughout .",
    "we determine the spin - orbit corrections to the band gaps by taking the differences between self - consistent calculations using the fully - relativistic pseudopotentials with or without noncollinear magnetism.@xcite we then apply these differences as scissor corrections to the corresponding quasiparticle band gaps obtained from scalar relativistic calculations .",
    "table  [ tb : latconst ] shows the comparison between our calculated lattice parameters and experiment .",
    "as expected the use of the local density approximation leads to a general underestimation of the experimental parameters .",
    "interestingly , while such underestimation does not exceed 1.1% along the direction of the ( a@xmath4b@xmath5)@xmath6 ribbons ( @xmath37 parameter in table  [ tb : latconst ] , cf .",
    "[ fig : cryst ] ) , the deviation can reach up to 4.2% in the direction perpendicular to the ribbons ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 parameters in table  [ tb : latconst ] ) .",
    "we tentatively assign this behavior to the fact that inter - ribbon forces are likely to include non - negligible van der waals components , and hence are not described correctly within the lda .",
    "inspection of the calculated cohesive energies seems to support this possibility .",
    "indeed we obtain intra - ribbon cohesive energies of 3.9  ev / atom ( sb@xmath0s@xmath1 ) , 3.5  ev / atom ( sb@xmath0se@xmath1 ) 3.6  ev / atom ( bi@xmath0s@xmath1 ) and 3.3  ev / atom ( bi@xmath0se@xmath1 ) . the inter - ribbon cohesive energy are one order of magnitude smaller , 0.2  ev / atom ( sb@xmath0s@xmath1 and sb@xmath0se@xmath1 ) and 0.3  ev / atom ( bi@xmath0s@xmath1 and bi@xmath0se@xmath1 ) .",
    "we also performed additional calculations of the structural parameters using the van der waals functional of ref .  .",
    "the lattice parameters calculated using the vdw functional overestimate the experimental values by up to 6.9% along the directions perpendicular to the ribbons , while along the ribbons the calculated parameters are in agreement with experiment ( within 0.3% ) .",
    "similar trends have been observed in calculations on graphite and boron nitride in ref .  .",
    "these results indicate that for semiconductors of the stibnite family the use of a van der waals functional does not improve the agreement of the calculated structural parameters with experiment .    in order to take into account the differences between calculated and experimental lattice parameters , in the following we report quasiparticle calculations obtained using either the dft / lda structure or the experimental structure .",

    "taking the calculated quasiparticle band gaps of 0.9 - 1.5  ev as representative of the optical gaps , the four semiconductors considered here lie precisely in the range of the optimal shockley - queisser performance.@xcite the shockley - queisser analysis addresses the ultimate efficiency of a solar cell based on a single material as light absorber and electron conductor , e.g.  silicon solar cells . in this analysis the optimum efficiency results from a trade - off between maximizing the band gap in order to increase the photovoltage , and minimizing the band gap in order to increase the photocurrent.@xcite    in the case of nanostructured solar cells based on the donor / acceptor concept such as for instance semiconductor - sensitized solar cells,@xcite the shockley - queisser analysis needs to be modified in order to take into account the energy - level alignment at the donor / acceptor interface .",
    "in fact , while the photocurrent is still determined by the optical gap of the absorber ( typically the donor ) , at variance with conventional bulk solar cells the photovoltage is dictated by the difference between the lowest unoccupied states of the acceptor and the highest occupied states of the donor .",
    "this effect can be taken into account by introducing the concept of `` loss - in - potential'',@xcite which is the reduction of the photovoltage resulting from the energy mismatch and additional losses .",

    "we have placed an emphasis on convergence tests and explored the effects of various calculation parameters , such as for instance the role of semicore @xmath3 electrons and lattice parameters .",
    "the inclusion of semicore electrons in the calculations is found to modify the band gaps by up to 0.2  ev , and the choice of experimental vs.  optimized lattice parameters can lead to differences of up to 0.3  ev in the calculated gaps .",
