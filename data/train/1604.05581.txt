    "on the cartesian plane there are two methods to define an ordered plane on which the pasch axiom is false .",
    "if we leave out a point from an euclidean plane we can give such a plane as a simple example . using this method",
    "we automatically omit some further axioms from the axiom system of the euclidean plane .",
    "a line through the missing point can not fulfil the first and third axioms of congruency ( namely , that every segment can be `` laid off '' on a given side of a given point on a given line in at least one way , and the axiom of the addition of congruent segments ) , respectively . in addition , the cantor axiom ( and consequently the dedekind axiom ) is also false on this plane .",
    "another method has been shown by szczerba ( see @xcite and @xcite ) who defined the property of `` betweenness '' based on an exotic ordering of the points on a line . applying this method on the cartesian plane we can define a plane in which  except the pasch axiom  all axioms of the euclidean plane hold .",
    "we describe this method briefly .",
    "let @xmath1 be an additive onto function and @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath3 if @xmath4 .",
    "then @xmath5 is a semi - ordered field , means that it is an ordered additive group but it is not hold necessarily that if @xmath6 and @xmath7 then @xmath8 .",
    "szczerba proved that the cartesian plane over @xmath5 satisfies the axioms of plane geometry ( with the full second - order continuity axiom ) except the pasch axiom .",
    "moreover if the ordering is not the usual one ( based on an @xmath9-linear mapping @xmath10 ) then the corresponding cartesian plane does not satisfy the pasch axiom . to define such a non - usual ordering we have to define an additive non - linear function .",
    "szczerba s method based on the hammel basis of the reals over the rationals and hence it uses the axiom of choice .",
    "addler certified in @xcite that the axiom of choice plays an essential role in szczerba s proof , namely all models satisfying the axioms of the euclidean plane except the pasch axiom are isomorphic to the model constructed by szczerba .",
    "addler noted also that the construction of additive non - linear functions implies the existence of non - measurable sets in the sense of lebesgue ( such a function is not lebesgue measurable ) .",
    "hence if we change the axiom of choice to the axiom of determinacy then all additive functions are linear ones , which means that all models satisfying the remaining axioms of the plane geometry fulfil the pasch axiom too .",
    "our purpose is to define a non - paschian plane based on such well - defined property of betweenness which can not be derived from an ordering of the points lying on a line . in the new model",
    "it is not possible to define the congruence of segments but we can define angle , triangle and angle measure , respectively . with respect to our definitions",
    "the plane has an elliptic character , meaning that the sum of the angles of a triangle is greater than @xmath0 .",
    "it is interesting that the continuity axioms hold as well .",
    "finally , contrary to the plane of szczerba our construction is independent from the axiom of choice , namely it remains a non - paschian plane even if we substitute the axiom of choice with the axiom of determinateness .",
    "there are several books on the foundations of geometry .",
    "we mention here some of them as references for the interested reader .",
    "we propose the books @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite to investigate non - euclidean geometries in general and the papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for a deeper investigation of the hyperbolic plane .",
    "in this paper the concept of _ plane _ has a double meaning , on one hand , it is a so - called _ set of points _ and on the other hand , it is a set of _ lines _",
    ", thus we denote by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "we would like to allow on the plane the binary notion of _ incidence _ to points and lines ; and the ternary notion of _ betweenness _ defined on the set of points which are lying on the same line .",
    "we use hilbert s axiom system ( see @xcite ) which is the most popular and used one in the fundamentals of geometry .",
    "let us denote the binary relation of _ incidence _ of the point @xmath13 and the line @xmath14 by @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the axioms of incidence are formulated as follows :    1 .",
    "for any two points @xmath13 and @xmath18 there exists a line @xmath14 which fulfil @xmath15 and @xmath19 .",
    "2 .   for any two distinct points there exists only one line that contains both ; consequently , if @xmath15 and @xmath19 and also if @xmath20 and @xmath21 are fulfilled then @xmath22 .",
    "( hence the line @xmath14 determined uniquely by @xmath13 and @xmath18 , and it can be denoted by @xmath23 . )",
    "3 .   there exist at least two points on a line ; for all @xmath17 there are @xmath24 such that @xmath15 and @xmath21 .",
    "there exist at least three points which do not lie on the same line .    for three points @xmath25 the relation that the point _",
    "@xmath18 is between the points @xmath13 and @xmath26 _ we denote by @xmath27 .",
    "the axioms of betweenness are    1 .   if @xmath27 , then @xmath28 , and there is a line @xmath29 which contains the points @xmath25 .",
    "if @xmath13 and @xmath26 are two distinct points , there is at least one point @xmath30 for which @xmath31 .",
    "3 .   of any three points on a line",
    "there exists only one which lies between the other two .",
    "( pasch s axiom ) : let @xmath13 , @xmath18 , @xmath26 be three distinct points not collinear and let @xmath14 be a line not passing through any of the points @xmath13 , @xmath18 , @xmath26 . if there exists a point @xmath32 lying on the line @xmath14 for which @xmath33 then either there is a point @xmath34 such that @xmath35 and @xmath36 or there exists a point @xmath37 such that @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "we note that hilbert s axiom system has a weaker form , where the existence part of @xmath40 ( `` there is at least one '' ) is proven by a theorem .",
    "as we can see from these axioms ( using tarski s apellations of @xcite ) we have a lower 2-dimensional axiom ( @xmath41 ) , but we do not use upper 2-dimensional axiom .",
    "in fact , the pasch s axiom ( @xmath42 ) in the present form restrict the value of the usual concept of dimension to @xmath43 and so a natural definition arise for ordered plane of dimension @xmath44 if we assume the above seven axioms . if we would like to consider the dimension open then we have to modify the strong axiom @xmath42 on such a way that it will be effect only on `` 2-dimensional configurations '' .",

    "for example , we do not investigate its validity on lines which intersects only two lines from the fixed three ones . hence we exclude those counterexamples on pasch",
    "s axiom in what a possible point of intersection has been dropped from the plane .",
    "we also disregard from those lines which in a case of the extension of the axiom system to the axiom system of a higher dimensional space can not be considered as a line of the plane of the points @xmath25 .    on the base of this weakening",
    "it is possible that we can not fit together the betweenness property of three lines , because there is no a fourth one which intersects all of them in distinct points .",
    "( the original strong form of pasch s axiom excludes this possibility . )",
    "hence we introduce a fourth axiom of incidence which is in the case when the original pasch s axiom holds is a consequence of the axioms .    1 .   :",

    "[ t5 ] requires that for a line @xmath71 the corresponding equivalence relation has exactly two equivalence classes .    the model of our non - paschian ordered plane is based on the known model of a finite line , which is the so - called _ line - model of five - points_. in this model a betweenness relation",

    "( thus the model shows that the axioms @xmath75 do not imply that a line has infinitely many points ( see in @xcite or @xcite ) . using this model",

    "let @xmath67 and @xmath34 be the vertices of a regular pentagon . clearly , all triangles determined by three vertices of a regular pentagon are isosceles triangles but not equilateral ones . hence in each triangle",
