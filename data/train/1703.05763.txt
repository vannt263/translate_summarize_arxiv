    "pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) are extended sources around a rotation powered pulsar .",
    "they show a broadband spectrum from radio to @xmath2-rays so that they would contain very high energy non - thermal particles @xcite .",
    "the central pulsar releases its rotational energy as the pulsar wind , which is a highly relativistic magnetized electron - positron outflow , and plays a role of the energy source of the pwn .",
    "the strong termination shock , which is formed by the interaction between the pulsar wind and external supernova remnant ( or interstellar medium ) , has been supposed to produce the non - thermal electrons and positrons , and they emit the synchrotron radiation @xcite and the inverse compton emission @xcite .",
    "pwne are characterized by a center - filled morphology caused by confinement in a supernova remnant ( snr ) , which is associated with the progenitor of the central pulsar .",
    "most pwne are detected as spatially extended sources in radio and x - rays . while the radio spectral index is almost spatially homogeneous ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the x - ray spectral index increases with the distance from the pulsar ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , pwne are found to be very bright sources in also tev @xmath2-rays @xcite .",
    "one - zone models of pwne , which are invented by @xcite and developed by several authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , can reproduce broadband spectra of entire nebulae well .",
    "the one - zone models do not describe the spatial distribution of the emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus it is indispensable to invest a model which includes the spatial structure of nebulae .    the model of ( * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter kc84s ) has been established as a standard model of pwne .",
    "they constructed a steady - state and 1-d magnetohydrodynamic model of the crab nebula . also , assuming the particle acceleration at the termination shock , they calculated the evolution of non - thermal pairs along the flow and the synchrotron emission from advected particles . adopting the model of kc84s , @xcite succeeded in reproducing the entire photon spectrum including the inverse compton component",
    "however , as @xcite suggested , it is unclear whether kc84s can apply to general pwne other than the crab nebula .",
    "furthermore , @xcite showed that the model of kc84s disagrees with the observed radial profile of the x - ray spectral index in 3c 58 .",
    "they suggested that the radial profile of the x - ray spectral index in the model should change more rapidly , and the x - ray nebula size becomes more compact than the observation .",
    "note that the entire photon spectrum was not taken into account as a model constraint in @xcite .",
    "this ignited the revision of kc84s .",
    "@xcite introduced the effect of the spatial diffusion of the particles , and reproduced the x - ray radial profile .",
    "@xcite supported this idea via 3-d magnetohydrodynamic and test - particle simulations . in each of the studies , simultaneous verification of the entire spectrum and the spatial profile of the emission",
    "is not discussed , thus there is no consensus on the spatial structure in pwn models so far . in order to advance the study ,",
    "it is essential to clarify controversial points in the simple steady 1-d model before introducing nontrivial effects such as the particle diffusion .",
    "we choose two objects , 3c 58 and g21.5 - 0.9 , to examine the 1-d steady model .",
    "both of the pwne show the feature that the extent of the x - ray emission is the same as the radio one , in contrast to the crab nebula , in which the observed size shrinks with increasing frequency .",
    "furthermore , the 1-d steady model has been never applied to those two pwne .",
    "our purpose is to make the validity of the 1-d steady model clear for general pwne , so that those two pwne are suitable targets for testing .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit the 1-d steady model and calculate the photon spectrum and its radial profile numerically . in section [ sec : model ] , we review the 1-d steady model of pwne based on kc84s . the parameter dependence of this model is investigated in section [ sec : dependence ] .",
    "the application to the two observed sources ( 3c 58 and g21.5 - 0.9 ) is presented in section [ sec : application ] .",
    "in this paper , we adopt the one - dimensional magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) model constructed by kc84s .",
    "we numerically solve the energy distribution of the electron ",
    "positron pair plasma along the outflow obtained by mhd equations . from the resultant spectral distribution of the pairs",

    "we review the the 1-d steady model and present the method to calculate the radial evolution of the energy distribution of electrons and positrons .    here , we consider that the pwn is a steady outflow and has a radius @xmath3 .",
    "the relativistic magnetized wind emitted from the central pulsar forms a strong termination shock at a radius @xmath0 . assuming that the pre - shock plasma is cold ,",
