    "solitary waves , such as bright and dark solitons , are ubiquitous dynamical patterns in the fields of nonlinear optics and matter waves @xcite .",
    "besides these customary waveforms , solitary coherent structures in the form of domain walls ( dws ) were also predicted in optical fibers with normal group - velocity dispersion carrying two waves with orthogonal polarizations , circular or linear , that interact through the cross - phase modulation induced by the kerr nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "similar structures were also predicted in planar nonlinear optical waveguides @xcite .",
    "the fiber - optic dws are distinguished by the property that , asymptotically , they contain a single polarization , with a switch between the polarizations in a localized region .",
    "optical - dw solutions were , in fact , found following the pattern of earlier known solutions of the dw ( alias grain - boundary ) type in systems of coupled ginzburg - landau equations that describe interactions between roll patterns @xcite or traveling waves @xcite with different orientations in a convection layer .",
    "domain walls may also arise in very different physical media ( that , however , bear a similar mathematical description ) , namely in binary ( two - component ) bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) .",
    "in particular , stable dw configurations have been predicted in quasi - one - dimensional ( cigar - shaped ) binary becs @xcite .",
    "such stable solutions can also exist in the presence of a periodic optical - lattice ( ol ) potential @xcite , combined with the parabolic magnetic trap @xcite .",
    "optical dws , as well as high - repetition periodic dw trains , have been experimentally observed in fibers @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "binary becs have been experimentally achieved , for instance , in mixtures of different spin states of @xmath0rb @xcite , including cases when an ol was used for the confinement @xcite .",
    "efforts were also made to create binary becs with different atomic species , such as @xmath1k and @xmath0rb @xcite , or @xmath2li and @xmath3cs @xcite .",
    "however , dws have not yet been observed , therefore a relevant issue is to predict more favorable conditions for their existence .    here ,",
    "we propose a setting in which patterns of the dw type can be realized in a _ single - component _ bec with the _ attractive _ interaction between atoms .",
    "we demonstrate that this may occur , under suitable conditions , in the presence of the ol potential .",
    "furthermore , we show that the corresponding dw solutions can be stabilized by the magnetic - trap potential .",
    "our results also predict the existence of patterns of the same type in nonlinear - optical media , such as a multichannel nonlinear planar waveguide with transverse modulation of the refractive index @xcite , or , possibly , in two - dimensional photonic crystals .",
    "in particular , the attractive character of the cubic nonlinearity , which is necessary for the existence of dws , is provided in optics by the usual kerr effect .",
    "the presentation is structured as follows : in section ii , we give a detailed formulation of the model , and develop an analytical approach to the dw solutions , based on the variational approximation ( va ) . in section iii , we construct the dw solution numerically , both in the absence and in the presence of the magnetic trap ; we obtain a variety of new solutions , including an asymmetric dw - type soliton and a twisted dw , as well as multi - dw patterns .",
    "section iv concludes the paper .",
    "assuming that the nonlinear interactions are weak relative to tight confinement in transverse dimensions , the transverse size of the cigar - shaped condensate is much smaller than its length .",
    "in such a case , which can be realized in strongly anisotropic traps , the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation , which governs the bec in the mean - field approximation , assumes an effectively one - dimensional form @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the single - atom wave function , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are measured , respectively , in units of @xmath8 and the transverse harmonic - oscillator length @xmath9 ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the mass and transverse confining frequency ) , and the energy unit is @xmath12 .",
    "the nonlinearity prefactor @xmath13 is proportional to the scattering length @xmath14 of the inter - atomic interactions ( see e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath15 corresponding to the repulsive / attractive interactions . in the general case ,",
    "the potential is @xmath16 where the two terms represent the magnetic trap and the ol , respectively . in eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 being the axial confining frequency ) is the effective strength of the magnetic trap , @xmath19 is the ol strength ( @xmath20 is the recoil energy , @xmath21 being the wavelength of the counter - propagating laser beams which generate the ol ) , and @xmath22 is the wavenumber of the ol . in the experiment , it can be controlled not only by changing @xmath21 , but also , more conveniently , by varying the angle @xmath23 between the laser beams , as the the local intensity in the interference pattern is modulated at the wavelength @xmath24 @xcite .    to estimate actual physical quantities in this situation",
    ", we can take a typical example of the attractive ( @xmath25 ) condensate of @xmath2li containing @xmath26 atoms , confined in a cigar - shaped trap with the frequencies @xmath27 hz and @xmath28 hz .",
    "this implies @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) , while the time and space units correspond to @xmath30 ms and @xmath31 m , respectively .",
    "finally , concerning the ol wavenumber , @xmath32 ( this is a value that will be dealt with in this work ) corresponds to the wavelength @xmath33 @xmath34 m of the interference pattern ( in physical units ) .",
    "these values can be used for the interpretation of the results that are presented below in terms of the dimensionless variables .",
    "stationary solutions to eq .",
    "( [ dweq1 ] ) are seeked for as @xmath35 , where @xmath34 is the chemical potential ( proportional to the energy per atom ) , and the real function @xmath36 obeys the equation @xmath37 the prime standing for @xmath38 .",
    "dw - like solutions are those following the pattern of the _ ansatz _ @xmath39 , \\label{dweq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the amplitude of the wave function at @xmath41 ( assuming an infinitely long system ) , and @xmath42 is the location of the dw s center . in linear",
    "quantum mechanics , a state of this type can not exist because the atoms would tunnel from the filled domain , @xmath43 , into the empty one , @xmath44",
    ". however , in the gp equation ( [ dweq1 ] ) , the nonlinear mean - field term adds a negative contribution to the effective potential in the filled domain . if , as a result , a state of the type ( [ dweq2 ] ) is possible with @xmath45 , the tunneling will be suppressed , and a dw state may be supported",
    "of course , such qualitative considerations provide no guarantee that a dw waveform will really exist . to investigate this possibility in quantitative terms",
    ", we will first resort to the va ( variational approximation ) , which will be followed by direct numerical analysis in the next section . to this end , we note that eq .",
    "( [ dweq8 ] ) can be derived from the lagrangian , @xmath46 , with the density @xmath47 in this part of the work , the potential @xmath48 does not include the parabolic trap , see eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) .    with the use of the ansatz ( [ dweq2 ] ) , the integral which gives",
    "the lagrangian @xmath49 diverges as @xmath50 .",
    "isolating the diverging part , and subjecting it to the variation in @xmath40 , immediately yields a result @xmath51 hence @xmath34 and @xmath52 should be of the same sign .",
    "because we actually need @xmath45 for the existence of the dw ( see above ) , this implies that @xmath53 , i.e. , _ attraction _ between atoms in becs ( which occurs in @xmath2li @xcite , as mentioned above , or in @xmath54rb @xcite ) , is a necessary condition for the existence of the dw .",
    "the actual shape of the dw differs from the simplest ansatz ( [ dweq2 ] ) by the presence of the oscillating part in the wave function at @xmath55 , see fig .",
    "( [ dweq1])(c ) below . in the lowest approximation , treating the ol term in eq .",
    "( [ dweq8 ] ) as a small perturbation , one can find the asymptotic form of the wave function at @xmath50 in the form @xmath56",
    "\\label{corrected}\\ ] ] [ the expression ( [ dweq5 ] ) was substituted for the amplitude ] , and the ansatz ( [ dweq2 ] ) can be modified accordingly , @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "the divergence of the lagrangian does not affect the remaining variational equations , @xmath58 ( cf . the situation in the case of solitons with nonvanishing tails , where variational equations for the core of the soliton can also be derived in a divergence - free form @xcite ) .",
    "an eventual result is @xmath59 equation ( [ cos ] ) describes equilibrium between the negative pressure force acting on the dw from the filled domain ( the attraction tends to pull the atoms in ) and the pinning force induced by the ol . the main conclusion following from eq .",
    "( [ cos ] ) is that a necessary condition for the existence of the dw solution is that the strength of the ol must exceed a minimum ( threshold ) value @xmath60 we note that the vanishing of the expression ( [ thr ] ) in the case of @xmath61 is a formal feature , produced by the divergence of the oscillating correction in eq .",
    "( [ corrected ] ) in this case .",
    "in fact , this is a resonant case , and a proper form of the correction can be derived using well - known methods of the nonlinear - resonance theory .",
    "we do not consider this special case here .",
    "comparison with numerical results presented in the next section shows that the exact threshold value is smaller than the one given by eq .",
    "( [ thr ] ) by a factor @xmath62 .",
    "this discrepancy may be explained by the assumption , implied in the ansatz ( [ dweq2 ] ) , that the dw has zero width ; in fact , numerical results [ see fig . [",
    "dfig1](c ) below ] demonstrate that it is narrow indeed , but still its width is not much smaller than @xmath63 .",
    "the va can be extended to incorporate a finite width of the dw ; however , the analytical results then become very cumbersome , therefore they are not displayed here .",
    "we will present results of computations for a typical case within the range of parameters in which the va predicts the existence of the dw , namely for @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "this case can be readily implemented in the experiment , adjusting the magnitude of the scattering length @xmath14 ( which sets the value of the normalized nonlinearity parameter @xmath52 ) by means of the feshbach resonance induced by external magnetic field @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; for other values of @xmath52 and @xmath34 , the results are quite similar . with fixed @xmath52 and @xmath34 , in what follows we vary the parameters of the potential to obtain different types of solutions .",
    "the stationary equation ( [ dweq8 ] ) was solved by means of a standard newton - type algorithm .",
    "once a solution @xmath66 to this equation was found , its linear stability was examined , using a straightforward form of the perturbed solution , @xmath67 \\right\\ } ,   \\label{ab}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 denotes the complex conjugation .",
    "the resulting linear equations for the small perturbations @xmath69 and @xmath70 are @xmath71 these can be tackled by means of a matrix eigenvalue solver ( using the finite - difference discretization with a spatial step chosen to be @xmath72 ) .",
    "the eigenfrequencies @xmath73 thus found will be shown in the spectral plane @xmath74 , where the subscripts denote their real and imaginary parts .",
    "the configuration is _ linearly unstable _ if there is an eigenfrequency with a non - vanishing imaginary part @xmath75 .",
    "if the stationary solution is found to be unstable , a fourth - order runge - kutta integrator , with time step @xmath76 and no - flux boundary conditions at the edges of the domain , was used to directly simulate the development of the instability .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]",
    "domain - wall ( dw ) solutions appear in a variety of contexts in optics and matter - wave physics , in both theoretical and experimental studies ( experimentally , dws have been observed in nonlinear optical fibers ) .",
    "most of these settings are inherently two - component ones with immiscible components , the repulsion between them making it possible to support stable dws .    in this work",
    ", we have investigated possibilities to create domain walls in _ single - component _ models ( particularly , in those based on the gross - pitaevskii equation , and relevant to the description of bose - einstein condensates ) in the presence of external potentials ( ol and parabolic trap ) .",
    "the same model is relevant to the study of spatial solitons in planar waveguides with transverse modulation of the refractive index . by means of the analytical approach , based on variational methods , and through direct simulations",
    "we have found that dws are possible only in the model with intrinsic attraction , and a necessary condition is that the ol strength must exceed a threshold value .",
    "regular domain walls ( with no zero crossings ) in the ol potential are found to be unstable , to which an explanation was given .",
    "if the magnetic trap is introduced , _ twisted _ dws can be stable , as well as asymmetric single - pulse soliton solutions .",
    "bound states of elementary dws ( regular and twisted ones ) have also been investigated ; they have a chance to be stable in the latter case .",
