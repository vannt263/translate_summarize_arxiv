    "the main impediment towards the use of single photons in schemes for deterministic quantum logic and teleportation @xcite as very robust and versatile carriers of quantum information @xcite is the weakness of optical nonlinearities in conventional media . a major trend aimed at the enhancement of optical nonlinearities exploits one - dimensional ( 1d- ) periodic distributed bragg reflectors and 2d- or 3d - periodic photonic crystals ( pcs ) , where light can be slowed down or trapped via multiple reflections in the vicinity of photonic bandgaps ( pbgs ) @xcite .",
    "giantly enhanced nonlinearity has been predicted when dopants with transition frequencies within the pbg are implanted in the structure , so that light near such frequencies resonantly interacts with the dopants and is concurrently affected by the pbg dispersion @xcite .",
    "the resulting soliton - like transmission of very weak pulses within the pbg while filtering out spurious noise is highly advantageous for classical communication @xcite .",
    "however , this mechanism is incompatible with the goals of quantum logic and communications , particularly with photon - photon entanglement , because of the quantum noise associated with resonant field - atom interactions .",
    "another pathway to enhance the nonlinearities is based on electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) in atomic media , which comes about when classical driving fields induce coherence between atomic levels and transform the weak fields into atom - dressed dark - state polaritons @xcite .",
    "the ultrahigh sensitivity of the eit polaritonic dispersion to a small field - induced stark shift of its atomic level can result in an appreciable nonlinear phase shift , impressed by one ultraweak field upon another @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding this promising sensitivity , eit - polariton entanglement by a large conditional phase shift of one photon in the presence of another ( also known as cross - phase modulation ) faces serious challenges in spatially uniform media .",
    "one drawback of these schemes has been the mismatch between the group velocities of the probe pulse moving as a slow eit polariton and the nearly - free propagating signal pulse , which severely limits their effective interaction length and the maximal conditional phase - shift @xcite . to enable long interaction times and thus large conditional phase shifts in a medium of finite length ( up to a few centimeters ) , the group velocities of _ both _ interacting pulses should be small @xcite .",
    "this , however , imposes a limitation on the photonic component of the signal polariton whose magnitude determines the phase shift .",
    "copropagating pulses pose yet another difficulty : since the phase - shift of each pulse is proportional to the local intensity of the other pulse , different parts of the interacting pulses acquire different phase shifts , which results in their spectral broadening .    here",
    "we put forward a mechanism that may produce strong photon - photon interactions along with suppressed quantum noise and give rise to their entanglement with high fidelity , by combining the advantages of their dispersion in pbg structures and of the strongly enhanced nonlinear optical coupling achievable via eit in an appropriately doped medium .",
    "the main idea is that a single - photon signal pulse is adiabatically converted into a standing - wave polaritonic excitation inside the periodic structure .",
    "this trapped polariton , having an appreciable photonic component , can impress a large , spatially - uniform phase shift upon a slowly propagating probe polariton",

    "the signal is stopped , its photonic component being converted into the stationary atomic ( raman ) coherence @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "next , the driving field @xmath22 is adiabatically switched on to a value @xmath23 , converting the atomic coherence into the signal field @xmath0 , whose frequency is inside of the pbg and amplitude is larger than that of the input signal @xmath12 by a factor of @xmath24 @xcite . due to the bragg scattering of the forward and backward propagating components of the signal pulse with the wave vectors @xmath25 , it remains localized ( trapped ) within the medium @xcite .",
    "both components @xmath0 of the signal field dispersively interact with atoms b via transition @xmath26 with the detuning @xmath27 .",
    "this off - resonant interaction causes an ac stark shift of level @xmath28 , thereby strongly affecting the eit dispersion for the probe field @xmath1 , which interacts with atoms b on the transition @xmath29 @xcite . for a large enough product of the signal - field intensity @xmath30 and interaction time @xmath31 ( @xmath32 being the probe group velocity )",
