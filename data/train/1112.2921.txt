    "one way to address this issue is the analysis of the magnetic properties of evolved stars . while the strong mg - fields of magnetic white dwarfs are easily detectable due to the prominent zeeman splitting of their spectral lines , weaker fields can only be detected with spectropolarimetry .",
    "such fields of the order of a few kg have been detected in white dwarfs and central stars of planetary nebulae .",
    "a first attempt to determine the magnetic fields of bright hot subdwarf stars using this method was made by @xcite , who also targeted hd76431 , but did not detect a magnetic field ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "@xcite on the other hand reported the detection of a magnetic field in hd76431 with a mean longitudinal field strength of @xmath7 using the medium resolution instrument fors1 mounted at the eso - vlt . here",
    "we present the results of a spectropolarimetric monitoring campaign of this star using high - resolution data .",
    "magnetic field measurements were performed with an analyser of circular polarization and dual - slicer ( 14 slices ) at a spectral resolution of @xmath8 on the main stellar spectrograph mounted at the 6 m telescope of the special astrophysical observatory ( sao ) in northern caucasus .",
    "eight spectra of hd76431 have been obtained with the quarter - wave plate rotating at @xmath9 and back with individual exposure times of @xmath10 .",
    "spectra of standard stars have been observed with the same setup .",

    "the shift due to the measured field is clearly visible .",

    "no excess was detected for hd76431 .",
    "whether this star has a companion remains unclear up to now .",
    "if so , the companion must be an object of low luminosity compared to the subdwarf , most likely a late main sequence star or a white dwarf .",
    "in contrast to the detection reported by @xcite no significant magnetic field could be found in hd76431 .",
    "this result is consistent with the non - detection by @xcite . given that the measurement obtained by @xcite is correct , the magnetic field of this star may be variable on a timescale of years .",
    "the reason for this variation may be slow rotation of the star .",
