    "in many social , technological , and biological networks , there exist several common topological characteristics which can be emerged by simple generation mechanisms @xcite , and a small fraction of networks crucially influences the communication properties for the routing and the robustness of connectivity .",
    "one of the sensational facts is the * small - world * ( sw ) phenomenon : each pair of nodes are connected through relatively small number of hops to a huge network size defined by the total number of nodes .",
    "this favorable phenomenon has been explained by the sw model with a small fraction of random rewirings on a one - dimensional lattice @xcite .",
    "another fact is the * scale - free * ( sf ) structure that follows a power - law degree distribution @xmath0 , @xmath1 , consists of many nodes with low degrees and a few hubs with high degrees .",
    "the heterogeneous networks are drastically broken into many isolated clusters , when only a small fraction of high degree nodes are removed as the intentional attacks @xcite .",
    "however , the sf structure is robust against random failures @xcite , and well balanced in the meaning of both economical and efficient communication by small number of hops in a connected network as few links as possible @xcite .    on the other hands , real complex networks , such as power - grid , airline flight - connection , and the internet ,",
    "are embedded in a metric space , and long - range links are restricted @xcite for economical reasons . based on the connection probability according to a penalty of distance @xmath2 between two nodes and on random triangulation",
    ", the generation mechanisms of geographical sf networks have been proposed in * lattice - embedded scale - free * ( lesf ) @xcite and * random apollonian * ( ra ) @xcite network models .",
    "unfortunately , the vulnerability of connectivity has been numerically found in both networks @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been theoretically predicted @xcite in a generating function approach to more general networks with any degree distribution that a geographical constraint on linking decreases the tolerance to random failures , since the percolation threshold is increased by the majority of small - order cycles that locally connected with a few hops . as the smallest - order",
    ", triangular cycles tend to be particularly constructed by a geographical constraint .",
    "in contrast , it has been suggested that higher - order cycles connected with many hops improve the robustness in the theoretical analysis on a one - dimensional sw model modified by adding shortcuts between two nodes out of the connected neighbors @xcite .",
    "similarly , the expected delivery time of any decentralized search algorithm without global information is decreased on a two - dimensional lattice whose each node has a shortcut with the connection probability proportional to the power of distance @xmath3 , @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "these results support the usefulness of shortcuts for maintaining both the robust connectivity and the communication efficiency , however the network structures are almost regular and far from the realistic sf .",
    "recently , it has been numerically shown @xcite that the robustness is improved by fully random rewirings under a same degree distribution @xcite in typical geographical network models : * delaunay triangulation * ( dt ) @xcite , ra , and * delaunay - like scale - free * ( dlsf ) networks @xcite . instead of rewirings",
    ", we expect the shortcut effect on the improvement of robustness in such geographical sf networks . adding shortcuts is practically more natural rather than rewirings , because the already constructed links are not wastefully discarded .",
    "thus , we investigate how large connected component still remains at a rate of removed nodes as the random failures and the targeted attacks on hubs in the geographical sf networks with shortcuts , comparing the original ones without shortcuts .",
    "we show that a small quantity of geographical randomness highly contributes to maintain both the communication efficiency and the robustness under almost invariant degree distributions to the original ones .",
    "it is not trivial that the improvement of robustness is equivalent to the effect by fully random rewirings .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we briefly introduce the geographical networks based on planar triangulation and embedding in a lattice under a given power - law degree distribution . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we numerically investigate the effects of shortcuts on the optimal paths in two measures of distance / hop and the robustness in the geographical networks . in particular , we show that a degree cutoff enhances the improvement of the error and attack tolerance .",
    "moreover , we virtually examine the effects for realistic data of the internet topologies . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we summarize these results .",
    "planar networks without crossing of links are suitable for efficient geographical routings , since we can easily find the shortest path from a set of edges of the faces that intersect the straight line between the source and terminal . in computer science , online routing algorithms @xcite that guarantee delivery of messages using only local information about positions of the source , terminal , and the adjacent nodes to a current node are well - known . as a connection to sf networks",
    ", we consider delaunay triangulation ( dt ) and random apollonian ( ra ) network models based on planar triangulation of a polygonal region .",
    "dt is the optimal planar triangulation in some geometric criteria @xcite with respect to the maximin angle and the minimax circumcircle of triangles on a two - dimensional space .",
    "in addition , the ratio of the shortest path length is bounded by a constant factor to the direct euclidean distance between any source and terminal @xcite , while ra network belongs to both sf and planar networks @xcite , however long - range links inevitably appear near the edges of an initial polygon . to reduce the long - range links ,",
    "delaunay - like scale - free ( dlsf ) network has been proposed @xcite .    on the preliminaries ,",
    "just like overhead highways , we add shortcuts between randomly chosen two nodes excluding self - loops and multi - links after constructing the above networks . for adding shortcuts , the routing algorithm can be extended as mentioned in appendix 1 .",
    "note that the added shortcuts contribute to create some higher - order cycles which consists of a long path and the overhead bridge in the majority of triangular cycles .",
    "the original degree distributions without shortcuts follow a power - law with the exponent nearly 3 in ra , log - normal in dt , and power - law with an exponential cutoff in dlsf networks @xcite .",
    "note that the lognormal distribution has an unimodal shape as similar to one in erds - renyi random networks .",
    "thus , ra and dlsf networks are vulnerable because of double constraints of planarity and geographical distances on the linkings , but dt networks are not so .",
    "we have confirmed that the degree distributions have only small deviation from the original ones at shortcut rate up to the amount of @xmath5 of the total links .",
    "let us consider a @xmath6-dimensional lattice of size @xmath7 with the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the lesf network model @xcite combines the configuration model @xcite for any degree distribution with a geographical constraint on a lattice .",
    "although the homogeneous positioning of nodes differs from a realistic spacial distribution such as in the internet routers according to the population density @xcite , it has been studied as a fundamental spacial model .",
    "note that the spatial distribution of nodes is restricted on the regular lattice , some links are crossed , therefore lesf networks are not planar .    in the following simulation ,",
    "we assign a degree taken from the distribution @xmath8 to each node on a two - dimensional lattice of the network size @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "the networks have the average numbers @xmath13 of the total links at @xmath14 and @xmath15 at @xmath16 for comparison .",
    "the case of @xmath17 is equivalent to the warren - sander - sokolov model @xcite whose degree distribution follows a pure power - law , however a cutoff is rather natural in real networks with something of constraints on linkings @xcite . as similar to the previously mentioned planar networks ,",
    "there are little deviation form the original power - law distributions with strong and weak cutoffs at @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the detailed configuration procedures for ra , dt , dlsf , and lesf networks are summarized in appendix 2 .",
    "for the shortcut rates from @xmath20 to @xmath21 , we investigate four combinations of distance / hops and two kinds of the optimal paths with respect to the shortest * distance * and the minimum number ( or called * length * ) of hops : the average distance @xmath22 on the shortest paths , the distance @xmath23 on the paths of the minimum hops , the average number of hops @xmath24 on these paths , and the number of hops @xmath25 on the shortest paths between any two nodes in the geographical networks .",
    "the prime denotes the cross relation to the case of no prime in the combinations of the measures and the two kinds of paths .",
    "the distance is defined by a sum of link lengths on the path , and the average means a statistical ensemble over the optimal paths in the above two criteria .",
    "note that the shortest path and the path of the minimum hops may be distinct , these are related to the link cost or delay and the load for transfer of a message .",
    "it is better to shorten both the distance and the number of hops , however the constraints are generally conflicted .     and",

    "we find that , from the solid and dashed lines in figs .",
    "[ fig_d_l](a)(b ) , the average distance @xmath22 and the number of hops @xmath24 become shorter as increasing the shortcut rate .",
    "in particular , the shortcuts are effective for the distance in ra and dlsf ( solid lines marked with circles and pluses ) networks , and also for the number of hops in dts ( dashed line marked with triangles ) . on another measures of @xmath23 and @xmath25 , the dashed lines for dts ( marked with triangles ) and ra ( with circles ) networks in fig . [ fig_d_l](a ) and the solid lines for ra ( with circles ) and dlsf ( with pluses ) networks in fig .",
    "[ fig_d_l](b ) approach to each other .",
    "thus , the shortcuts even around @xmath26 decrease both @xmath22 and @xmath24 , and maintain small @xmath23 and @xmath25 . on the other hand , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_sfl_d_l ] , the average distance and the number of hops are almost constant in lesf networks . probably , the links emanated from hubs already act as shortcuts on the lattice .",
    "these results are obtained from ensembles over 100 realizations for each network model .",
    "the fault tolerance and attack vulnerability are known as the typical properties of sf networks @xcite , which are further affected by geographical constraints .",
    "we investigate the tolerance of connectivity in the giant component ( gc ) of the geographical networks with shortcuts comparing with that of the original ones without shortcuts .",
    "the size @xmath27 of gc and the average size @xmath28 of isolated clusters are obtained from ensembles over 100 realizations for each network model .",
    "figure [ fig_gc_rand ] shows the typical results that a small fraction of shortcuts suppresses the breaking of the gc against random failures .",
    "it seems to be enough in less than @xmath26 . in other dlsf , lesf ( @xmath19 ) networks ,",
    "the effects are similar .",
    "thus , the added shortcuts strengthen the tolerance in comparison with each original network",
    ".    figures [ fig_gc_attack ] and [ fig_size_attack ] show the effect of shortcuts on the robustness against the targeted attacks on hubs . in particular , around the shortcuts rate @xmath26 ,",
    "the extremely vulnerable ra and dlsf networks are improved up to the similar level to dts .",
    "we compare the critical values of fraction @xmath29 of removed nodes at the peak of the average size @xmath28 , as the gc is broken off .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig_fc](b ) , the critical values @xmath29 in ra and dlsf networks reach to @xmath30 at the level of the original dts without shortcuts .",
    "it is consistent with the effect in evolving networks with local preferential attachment @xcite that the tolerance becomes higher as increasing the cutoff under the same average degree @xmath31 and size @xmath32 .",
