    "as can be seen fig.[f6 ] during the prolonged deep minimum between cycles 23 and 24 the north - south asymmetry in the number of small sunspot groups also indicates the southern hemisphere dominate with more small sunspot groups .",

    "[ f1 ] and [ f2 ] show that in cycle  24 the peaks of the small sunspot groups are small in both the northern and southern hemispheres and their heights close to the heights of the corresponding peaks of the weak cycle  14 .",

    "the difference between the mean values of the ratios of cycles  23 and 24 seem to be slightly larger in the southern hemisphere than in the northern hemisphere .",
    "from the analysis and the results above we can draw the following conclusions :    1 .   the solar cycle pair ( 22 , 23 ) violated the g - o rule of sunspot cycles mainly due to , besides in cycle  23 a large deficiency of small sunspot groups in both the northern and southern hemispheres , during cycle  22 a large abundance of small sunspot groups in the southern hemisphere .",
    "2 .   in the case of large and small sunspot groups",
    "the cycle pair ( 22 , 23 ) violated the g - o rule in the northern and the hemispheres , respectively , suggesting the north - south asymmetry in solar activity has a significant contribution in the violation of g - o rule .",
    "3 .   in both the northern and southern hemispheres the average ratio of the number of large to the number of small sunspot groups is larger in the rising phase of cycle  24 than that in the same phase of cycle  23 .",
    "this could be a reason behind the cmes ( halo ) are more abundant ( in spite of the low sunspot activity ) in the rising phase of cycle  24 than in the same phase of cycle  23 .",
    "the mechanisms of the generations of the magnetic structures of the large and the small sunspot groups may be associated with plasma dynamics at deeper and sallower layers , respectively , of the sun s convection zone  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "that is , the magnetic structures of large sunspot groups are deep rooted than the those of small sunspot groups .",
    "this could be responsible for the above said difference in the north - south asymmetry of the numbers of large sunspot groups with that of small sunspot groups .",
    "the conclusion 3 above is consistent with the known result that the cme productivity increases with active region size  @xcite .",
    "that is , a large sunspot group could produce relatively a large number of cmes .",
    "large sunspot groups also live long and their rate of evolution / decay also seem to be relatively large  @xcite . hence , during the evolution / decay of a large sunspot group the release of relatively large amount of underneath stored thermal energy may be responsible for more cmes .",

    "<S> according to gnevyshev - ohl ( g - o ) rule an odd - numbered cycle is stronger than its preceding even - numbered cycle . in the modern time </S>",
    "<S> the cycle pair  ( 22 , 23 ) violated this rule . by using the combined greenwich photoheliographic results ( gpr ) and solar optical observing network ( soon ) sunspot group data during the period 18742015 , and debrecen photoheliographic data ( dpd ) of sunspot groups during the period 19742015 , here we have found that the solar cycle pair ( 22 , 23 ) violated the g - o rule because , besides during cycle  23 a large deficiency of small sunspot groups in both the northern and the southern hemispheres , during cycle  22 a large abundance of small sunspot groups in the southern hemisphere . in the case of large and small sunspot groups </S>",
    "<S> the cycle pair ( 22 , 23 ) violated the g - o rule in the northern and southern hemispheres , respectively , suggesting the north - south asymmetry in solar activity has a significant contribution in the violation of g - o rule . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of solar cycle  24 is smaller than that of solar cycle  23 . </S>",
    "<S> however , coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) rate in the rising phases of the cycles  23 and 24 are almost same ( even slightly large in cycle  24 ) . from both the soon and the dpd sunspot group data here </S>",
    "<S> we have also found that on the average the ratio of the number ( counts ) of large sunspot groups to the number of small sunspot groups is larger in the rising phase of cycle  24 than that in the corresponding phase of cycle  23 . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest this could be a potential reason for the aforesaid discrepancy in the cme rates during the rising phases of cycles 23 and 24 . </S>",
    "<S> these results have significant implication on solar cycle mechanism . </S>"
