    "frozen gases are a new and in some ways ideal laboratory to test our understanding of quantum theory in a complex system . with present technology one can manipulate and detect electronic processes with an extraordinary selectivity and precision ; furthermore , the translational temperature of the gas can be lowered to the point where it can be ignored when discussing electronic processes .",
    "frozen rydberg gases have the added advantages that their states are well understood and many processes occur on a microsecond time scale , easily allowing for time - resolved spectroscopy .",
    "pioneering experiments on resonant processes in these gases have been carried out by anderson _ _ et al.__@xcite and mourachko _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "the present work was motivated by the desire to understand those experiments and the subsequent work of lowell _ _ et al.__@xcite highlighting the dynamic aspects of these resonant , many particle systems .",
    "the measurements are of mixtures of @xmath5 atoms initially prepared in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 states ( henceforth to be called the @xmath8 and @xmath9 states , respectively ) .",
    "there are initially @xmath10 atoms in the @xmath8 state and @xmath11 atoms in the @xmath12 state .",
    "the transition @xmath13 is monitored , where @xmath14 refers to the @xmath15 state and @xmath16 refers to the @xmath17 state , at and near resonance , where @xmath18 .",
    "some of the experimental features we wish to understand are the rapid rise followed by slow approach to saturation of the signal and the width of the lineshape ( in the detuning @xmath19 ) as a function of time .",
    "each individual interaction leads to a ( coherent ) oscillatory behavior , but as we will see below , averaging the @xmath20 interaction over the random positions of the atoms greatly smooths out the signal . the effective `` incoherence '' brought about by the @xmath21 process ( the `` walking away '' discussed by mourachko _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite ) completes the smoothing out of the on - resonance signal but has less effect on the off - resonance signal .",
    "( the @xmath22 process is also present , but is smaller than @xmath23 by a factor of @xmath24 in this case and can therefore be neglected to the first approximation . )",
    "it was surmised by anderson _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite that the linewidth must be of the order of the average interaction energy .",
    "this interaction splits the @xmath25-@xmath26 degeneracy and the subsequent migration of the @xmath27 state to other atoms broadens the energy of this `` elementary excitation '' into a band , as appropriate to an amorphous solid .",
    "cluster calculations were performed to illustrate this band formation@xcite , but averaging over atom positions was done by order - of - magnitude arguments only .",
    "mourachko _ _ et al.__@xcite pointed out , in connection with their experiments on a different system , that the `` walking away '' of the @xmath28 excitation from its original location should be regarded as a diffusion process , and dynamical equations for the resonance transition in the presence of this diffusion were written down@xcite .",
    "the present work builds on these earlier insights , but goes considerably further in the process of accurately averaging over atomic positions .",
    "it turns out that this averaging ( effectively , a phase averaging ) itself produces an @xmath29 dependence at large times , characteristic of a diffusive process .",
    "a report of the newer experimental data by lowell _",
    "_ in comparison with the results of the present theory is being submitted separately@xcite . in this paper",
    "we give a full account of the general theory , and we discuss in detail in section  [ dilute ] a particular case that cleanly shows the effects of randomness and phase - averaging . in this simple case , the averaging process can be carried out exactly . for the practically important @xmath0 interaction potential , one can proceed in a mathematically elegant way and obtain closed formulas that can be evaluated by a computer package , or in some cases by hand .",
    "it appears to be a fortunate coincidence that the @xmath0 potential accurately describes the dipole - dipole interactions that are so prevalent in nature .",
    "some aspects of this approach are easily extended to more general interactions ; however , the @xmath0 dependence has special properties which , when coupled with the assumption of a random distribution of atoms , lead to relatively simple results .",
    "although this work was stimulated by experiments on rydberg atoms , it is generally applicable to resonances induced by dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "these may be common in highly excited gases and in molecular systems .",
    "frozen , resonant gases may even exist in interstellar clouds .",
    "we develop the theory in three stages .",
    "first , in section  [ dilute ] , we discuss a single @xmath9 atom interacting resonantly with a surrounding gas of @xmath8 atoms , without any possibility for the @xmath8 excitation to `` walk away '' through an @xmath21 process . when the result is averaged over the positions of the @xmath8 atoms , it corresponds to a `` sparse '' system of @xmath12 atoms , i.e. a system where @xmath30 .",
    "we do not know of an existing experiment to which this treatment applies , so this section can be viewed as a theoretical prediction of the outcome of a possible experiment .",
    "our purpose here is also one of exposition : this example allows us to introduce in the simplest context some of the mathematical techniques used throughout the paper . in section  [ decay ] , we complicate things somewhat by allowing the @xmath8 state to decay away exponentially ( or more generally , but explicit formulas are given for the exponential decay ) .",
    "if the @xmath8 state decays diffusively , our treatment here is related to that of mourachko _ _ et al.__@xcite , except for the introduction of mathematically exact phase averaging . here ,",
    "too , the treatment applies only to the case where @xmath30 .",
    "finally , in section  [ spin ] we introduce an effective spin hamiltonian which fully models the atomic system for all values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , as well as for any strength of the resonant process @xmath31 and of the mixing processes ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) .",
    "this system is relevant to the experiments of anderson _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and lowell _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "we show its equivalence to the previous results in the sparse limit @xmath34 and discuss briefly the approximate solution in the non - sparse case .",
    "the results in this section are summarized elsewhere@xcite , but the derivation is presented here for the first time , as are additional formulas .",
    "the limitations of the present theory and some of the many possible extensions are discussed briefly in section  [ discuss ] .",
    "we consider one atom , initially in the state @xmath9 , in interaction with a gas of @xmath8 atoms through an @xmath20 process . like mourachko _ _ et al.__@xcite , we describe the system by the equations :    @xmath35    here @xmath36 is the amplitude of the state in which the atom at the origin is in state @xmath9 and all other atoms are in state @xmath8 , while @xmath37 ( with @xmath38 running from @xmath39 to @xmath10 ) is the amplitude of the state in which the atom at the origin is in state @xmath16 and the atom at @xmath40 is in state @xmath41 , while all the others remain in state @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath42 is the interaction potential and @xmath43 is the detuning from resonance .",
    "we will assume that @xmath42 is of the dipole - dipole form @xmath44 the atoms are sufficiently cold that during the time scale of interest they move only a very small fraction of their separation , and therefore @xmath42 can be taken to be independent of time .",
    "as the temperature increases one approaches the opposite limit , where binary collisions control the resonant process@xcite .",
    "there must of course be a gradual transition , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the set of differential equations ( 1 ) can easily be solved with the initial condition @xmath45 and @xmath46 for all @xmath38 , yielding @xmath47 with @xmath48 eq .",
    "( [ ckdot ] ) then gives @xmath36 .",
    "the experiment monitors an optical transition from the @xmath16 state ( or , equivalently , from one of the @xmath41 states ) , which is proportional to @xmath49 we see that the signal @xmath50 exhibits rabi oscillations .",
    "we apply this result to a system of @xmath51 atoms , initially in state @xmath9 , randomly dispersed among a much larger number , @xmath10 , of @xmath8 atoms . in this sparse limit ,",
    "the signal is proportional to @xmath51 times the sample average of @xmath52 , and the sample average is equivalent to an ensemble average over the atomic positions @xmath40 that are hidden in @xmath53 ( see eq .",
    "( [ avexp ] ) below ) . in general , averaging is more easily done on the laplace transform of the signal , which in this case is @xmath54 later in this paper , more complex models are solved directly by laplace ( or fourier ) transforms ; thus eq .",
    "( [ stild ] ) is useful for comparison with these more general results and approximations .      to compute ensemble averages , we use the following result , valid in the limit @xmath55 , for a random distribution of the variables @xmath40 : @xmath56   \\nonumber \\\\ \\hspace{-0.2 cm } & = & \\hspace{-0.2cm}\\left\\ { \\frac{1}{\\omega } \\int d^{3}r\\exp \\left [ -\\beta v^{2}(r)\\right ] \\right\\ } ^{n }   \\nonumber \\\\",

    "a single @xmath163 pair produces , of course , a signal with a sinusoidal behavior , and the same is true , less obviously , for a single @xmath9 interacting with a sea of @xmath8 that are not mutually interacting .",
    "the phase interference brought in by averaging over configurations causes the signal from a sparse system of @xmath9 to take on the form shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "because the averaging does not completely wash out the oscillations at small times , especially for nonzero values of the detuning , the resonance linewidth has the nonmonotonic behavior seen in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] .",
    "the initial rise of the averaged signal is linear in time , even though the unaveraged signal is quadratic , and is given by @xmath245 , with @xmath62 defined in eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) .",
    "the linewidth at large times is approximately @xmath246@xcite .",
    "the fact that @xmath62 is sizably larger than the simple estimate @xmath247 reflects quantitatively the fact that  close pairs \" of atoms are more heavily weighted in the average .",
    "in section  [ decay ] we try to allow for any ratio @xmath248 , but we still keep @xmath240 : physically , we consider a sparse distribution of ( initially ) @xmath9 states in a gas where @xmath160-@xmath161 flips take place at a non - negligible rate .",
    "the first question we should answer is : after the @xmath249 transition , does the @xmath28 state `` walk away '' to infinity or remain localized ? in this paper , we have assumed that localization does not take place , or , if it does , is important only in the very sparse limit where the localization length is smaller than @xmath250 .",
    "leaving much room for future work , we have simply introduced a lifetime @xmath251 for the @xmath28 state to `` stick around '' .",
    "the spectral function for the propagating @xmath160-@xmath161 flip is then simply a lorentzian .",
    "we have obtained tentative estimates of @xmath106 when it is entirely due to the @xmath160-@xmath161 flips , and we plan to report these results in the near future .",
    "there can also be other contributions to @xmath106 , arising for instance from translational motion of the atoms .",
    "( the gas can be treated as frozen to a good approximation when the typical collision time @xmath252 exceeds @xmath139 , and certainly @xmath253 contributes to @xmath254 . ) in this paper , we in effect add a damping term to the equations of section  [ dilute ] , making the problem soluble again .",
    "the effect of @xmath106 is to further smooth out and wash away the oscillatory behavior of the unaveraged signal . for large @xmath106",
    "all traces of the oscillations are wiped out and the signal saturates according to @xmath255 , where @xmath4 is given by eq .",
    "( [ gammaeq ] ) .",
    "the saturated linewidth is infinite , because the @xmath9 state eventually decays for all values of @xmath83 .",
    "however , the signal at finite @xmath2 varies significantly with @xmath256 indicating that the linewidth has a minimum at intermediate times . for small @xmath2",
    "the signal is always independent of @xmath256 consistent with a linewidth proportional to @xmath257 , as seen already in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] .",
    "in section  [ spin ] we introduce an effective spin hamiltonian to describe the resonating frozen gas for all values of the parameters @xmath258 and @xmath259 , and we discuss in particular the case @xmath194 , which is relevant to the experiments carried out so far .",
    "the only simplification we make in this spin hamiltonian is to neglect the potential responsible for the @xmath260-@xmath261 interaction .",
    "this coupling can easily be included , although the resulting equations of motion contain more terms and would be more difficult to handle ; it is in fact small for the experiments of anderson _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "other resonant systems can be described by similar spin hamiltonians .",
    "the experiment of mourachko _ _ et al.__@xcite , for example , consists of a @xmath262 resonance in the presence of @xmath160-@xmath161 and @xmath263 flips .",
    "a spin - one hamiltonian therefore describes this system , with the @xmath264 @xmath148 and @xmath39 spin states corresponding to the @xmath265 @xmath266 and @xmath9 atomic states , respectively . in this case , there is only one set of spins and all spins are initially in the @xmath267 state .",
    "the spin model we have discussed in this paper consists of two sets of spins , which complicates matters but at the same time allows one to consider the limit in which one set is sparse .",
    "there is practically no end to the variety of phenomena that this type of spin hamiltonian can describe , combining features from many branches of physics .",
    "atomic physics , random systems , spin systems and magnetic resonance , and many - body theory are all represented .",
    "the equilibrium behavior poses interesting problems of statistical mechanics , but we are interested in the quantum dynamics , starting from a prepared state .",
    "we have obtained and solved approximate dynamical equations for the case @xmath268 , using the lorentzian approximation as in section  [ decay ] to model the @xmath160-@xmath161 interaction . much more",
    "work can be done and is now in progress , and some of the results may change when better approximations are introduced . in particular , in a better theory",
    "the linewidth is likely to depend on the @xmath160-@xmath161 interaction as well as on the @xmath269-@xmath26 . nevertheless , the qualitative behavior of the signal is common to all approximations we have tested so far and matches what is seen in the experiments that initially motivated this work .",
    "the important features that we already discussed are all there : the sharp initial rise , the slow saturation , the dependence on @xmath83 that is less pronounced at small times and corresponds to a time - dependent linewidth .",
