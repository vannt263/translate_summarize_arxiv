    "surges are phenomena in which dark dense mass are ejected in the solar atmosphere from chromospheric into coronal heights . usually , they appear as straight or slightly curved ejective structures , and they often recur @xcite . at first ,",

    "the rotational or helical motions were , on occasions , also observed in surge activity @xcite .",
    "surges were also observed as emission in he ii @xmath18    solar images @xcite , obtained by the slitless xuv spectrograph on a _ skylab _ mission and with the extreme ultraviolet imaging telescope on board the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _",
    "( _ soho _ ) , respectively . with developing observational instruments and spacecrafts ,",
    "chromospheric ejections were detected by using data from the @xmath2  cm swedish vacuum solar telescope and the _ transition region and coronal explorer _ ( _ trace _ , @xcite ) , as well as from the big bear solar observatory @xcite and with the solar ultraviolet measurements of emitted radiation ( sumer ) spectroscopic observations on board _ soho _ @xcite .",
    "based on observational studies , it is now accepted that the driving mechanism of mass ejection in surges is magnetic reconnection at chromospheric heights .",
    "@xcite found that h@xmath0 surges occur at the very beginning phases of magnetic - flux emergence , and suggested that surges are produced by magnetic reconnection between the emerging flux and the pre - existing magnetic flux .",
    "@xcite reported that circumstances favorable to magnetic reconnection are produced by moving satellite spots in a surge - productive region .",
    "@xcite presented a multi - wavelength study of recurrent surges originated due to the photospheric reconnections .",
    "very recently , @xcite reported a multi - wavelength study of solar jets on 2010 december 11 using the _ solar dynamics observatory _ ( _ sdo _ , @xcite ) data .",
    "they found an increase in the amplitude of oscillations close to their footpoints of the observed jets , which provides the evidence for the wave - induced reconnection as a mechanism for jets triggering .",
    "@xcite also showed that a high - temperature x - ray jet and a cool untwisted surge can coexist located side by side at the site ( see fig .",
    "10c in their paper ) .",
    "@xcite and @xcite succeeded to reproduce surge mass ejections from chromospheric heights by magnetic reconnection between an emerging flux and a pre - existing magnetic field .",
    "this numerical result was later confirmed by @xcite who studied the radio properties of @xmath19 x - ray coronal jets as observed by the _",

    ", they found electron temperature @xmath21  k and emission measure @xmath22  @xmath6 , as well as derived constraints on the ejecta electron number density , notably @xmath23  @xmath6 .",
    "h@xmath0 surges and associated soft x - ray loops were also studied by @xcite who performed simultaneous observations of noaa ar 6850 on 1991 october 7 , made with the msdp spectrograph operating on the solar tower in meudon and with the _ yohkoh _ sxt . by measuring the volume emission measures of the two flaring loops ( northern and southern ones ) and the surge region ( mid - part of the surge )",

    "they also measured the temperature and density distribution of the observed surge during its maximum rise and found an average temperature and a number density of @xmath8  k and @xmath31  @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "@xcite studied the conditions for flares and surges in ar 2744 on 1980 october 21 and 22 using observations from the _ solar maximum mission _ satellite and coordinated ground - based observations , which together covered a wide temperature range from @xmath32  k to @xmath33  k. in particular , the detected surge on october 22 had a total emission measure of @xmath34  @xmath6 and duration of about @xmath35  s. the rough estimations of temperature and electron number density yielded @xmath36  k and @xmath37  @xmath6 .",
    "similar values for the temperature and electron number density of h@xmath0 surges were obtained earlier by @xcite from observations of a surge prominence in ar 17212 on 1980 october 30 made at an interval of @xmath38  s and @xmath16  s in the h@xmath0 line center , through a halle filter of @xmath39    passband in conjunction with a @xmath40  cm aperture solar spar telescope .",
    "as seen , the electron number density and the temperature of solar surges can vary in rather wide limits , from @xmath41  @xmath6 and @xmath42  k for cool h@xmath0 surges to @xmath43  @xmath6 and @xmath44  k for high - temperature euv surges . since each surge is a jet in a well - defined magnetic flux tube , it is naturally to expect that the magnetohydrodynamic waves propagating along the magnetized plasma flow can become unstable against the kelvin ",
    "helmholtz ( kh ) instability .",
    "it is well - known that kh instabilities occur when two fluids of different densities or different speeds flow by each other . in the solar atmosphere , which is made of a very hot and practically fully ionized plasma ,",
    "the two flows come from an expanse of plasma erupting off the sun s surface as it passes by plasma that is not erupting .",
    "the difference in flow speeds and densities across this boundary sparks the instability that builds into the waves .",
    "when the instability reaches its nonlinear stage , vortices might form , reconnection might be initiated and plasma structures might detach . now , after the launch of _ sdo _ satellite , due to its high spatial and temporal resolution , the kh instability of the coronal mass ejection reconnection outflow layer in the lower corona , occurred on 2010 november 3 , has been imaged by @xcite .",
    "very recently , that kh instability observation was modeled by @xcite . a concise but very good exploration of kh instabilities in the solar atmosphere in view of their interpretation from observations the reader can find in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this study is to see whether mhd waves traveling along the surge jet can become unstable within its velocity range of @xmath17@xmath15  kms@xmath3 . in the following sect .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we will build up simplified models for the surge .",

    "the last sect .",
    "[ sec : concl ] summarizes our results .",
    "we explore one of the four h@xmath0 surges observed by @xcite in the solar active region noaa ar 8227 ( n@xmath45 , e@xmath46 ) on 1998 may 30 from 7:50 to 16:50 ut . the electron number density derived from the emission measure analysis of the _ trace _",

    "estimated chromospheric magnetic field is @xmath49  g and from the conservation of magnetic flux between the reconnection region and the photosphere one finds that the coronal magnetic field is @xmath4@xmath16  g. @xcite claim that their observations confirm the emerging flux regions model of @xcite and @xcite ; moreover the clear evidence of spatiotemporal correlations between chromospheric ( ca ii k , h@xmath0 ) and coronal brightenings ( _ trace _ fe ix @xmath47   ) indicates that the chromosphere is heated up to coronal temperatures at the surge footpoint by the energy release during magnetic field reconnection , as shown in the numerical simulation of @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the main body of the aforementioned surge is positioned at the tr / lower corona region .",
    "thus , we can take the electron number density of the surge environment to be equal to @xmath50  @xmath6 ( the label ` e ' stands for _ exterior _ ) , and its temperature reasonably can be @xmath51  k. concerning the surge temperature , we suppose it to be equal to @xmath52  k. then with a background magnetic field @xmath53  g and a density contrast @xmath54 ( we assume that plasma densities in both media are homogeneous ) , we have the following characteristic sound and alfvn speed inside the surge and in the surrounding magnetized plasma : @xmath55  kms@xmath3 , @xmath56  kms@xmath3 ( more exactly @xmath57  kms@xmath3 , which value determines the magnetic field inside the jet to be equal to @xmath58  g ) , and @xmath59  kms@xmath3 , @xmath60  kms@xmath3 .",
    "thus , the plasma betas of the two media are respectively @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "incompressible plasma is a good approximation to study the kh instability , though the observed values are not favorable for the incompressibility . nevertheless , in the following we consider the incompressible plasma inside and outside the surge .     solar surge . ]",
    "we model the surge as a vertically moving with a velocity @xmath63 cylindrical flux tube with radius @xmath64 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) , where @xmath65  mm is the surge width .",
    "our frame of reference is attached to the tr / coronal plasma that implies that @xmath63 is the relative jet velocity with respect to its environment . we must mention that because the density contrast , @xmath66 , is relatively high , in such a case , like in spicules , the occurrence of a kh instability , for instance of kink ( @xmath67 ) waves , becomes possible at generally high alfvn mach numbers ( the alfvn mach number is defined as the ratio of jet velocity to alfvn speed inside the jet , @xmath68 ) and correspondingly at high critical flow velocities being far beyond the speeds accessible for surges / spicules in the solar atmosphere @xcite .",
    "this circumstance implies that the only possible way for emerging a kh instability in surges is the excitation of higher mhd harmonics that can become unstable at sub - alfvnic flow velocities in twisted tubes @xcite . here ,",
    "we consider two possible magnetic field geometries : ( i ) a moving twisted magnetic flux tube embedded in untwisted magnetic field @xmath69 ( the left tube in fig .",

    "our model for the surge is a vertically moving twisted magnetic cylindrical flux tube that might be surrounded by plasma embedded in homogeneous magnetic field or by magnetized plasma with twisted magnetic field . in each case",
    "the twist of given magnetic field ( internal or external one ) is characterized by the ratio of azimuthal magnetic field component at the inner surface of the tube to its longitudinal component . among the mhd modes which propagate along the moving tube only the high harmonics with negative mode numbers",
    "can become unstable at accessible critical flow velocities .",
    "one can observe practically a developing kh instability if only the parameter @xmath155 characterizing the magnetic field twist is large enough .",
    "for instance , at the first magnetic field configuration ( the left flux tube in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) the @xmath152 harmonic becomes unstable at critical flow velocity of @xmath1  kms@xmath3 and wavelength @xmath153  mm with a linear growth rate @xmath154  s@xmath3 as the magnetic field twist parameter @xmath182 .",
    "we note , that exploring the kh instability @xcite in a high - temperature solar surge , like that observed by @xcite , for the same mode at the same position on the @xmath137-axis and the same value of @xmath155 , one obtains a wave growth rate of @xmath194  s@xmath3 being exactly equal to the growth rate of the imaged kh instability in a coronal mass ejecta in the lower corona by @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the aforementioned @xmath154  s@xmath3 is of the same order as the growth rate of @xmath195  s@xmath3 of vortex - shaped features along the interface between an erupting ( dimming ) region and the surrounding corona imaged by the _ sdo_/aia as reported by @xcite .",
    "all these comparisons allows us to believe that the kh instability might be imaged in surges , too . the second magnetic field configuration ( the right flux tube in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) , reveals some new aspects of the kh instability , notably for a fixed pair of magnetic fields twist parameters , in our case equal to @xmath159 and @xmath160 , for given high - harmonic mode one appears two instability windows on the @xmath137-axis , next to each other .",
    "thus , the range of kh instability is extended .",
    "true , in the second instability windows the growth rates are much lower than in the standard instability windows , but nevertheless these weak / slow instabilities can occur . moreover , the critical flow velocity for emerging kh instability might be relatively lower .",
    "for example , the @xmath158 harmonic with wavelength of @xmath196  mm can become unstable at jet speed of only @xmath197  kms@xmath3 and its growth rate is equal to @xmath198  s@xmath3 .",
    "solar h@xmath0 surges are generally small - scale eruptive events and their contributions to solar coronal heating due to triggered by the kh instability wave turbulence is modest .",
    "there are some cases , for instance as surges are detected in uv and euv spectral lines , when the developing kh instability can bring forth a noticeable contribution to the solar corona energy budget .",
