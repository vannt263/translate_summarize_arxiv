    "several studies , based on the first year of fermi / lat operations , have shown that : ( i ) the @xmath0-ray and the averaged radio flux densities are significantly correlated ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and ( ii ) blazars detected at @xmath0-rays are more likely to have larger doppler factors and larger apparent opening angles than those not detected by lat ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this observational evidence strongly suggests that radio and @xmath0-ray emission have a co - spatial origin . to locate and identify the region where the bulk of @xmath0-ray emission is produced , and to provide details about its connection to the radio jet , an analysis of simultaneous radio and @xmath0-ray light curves is essential .    however , we highlight two caveats about the interpretation of radio / gamma correlation analyses , which have often been interpreted too simplistically .",
    "first , it is well - known that there is usually a considerable delay between mm and cm radio flares .",
    "thus , although cm - flares would tend to peak after the @xmath0-ray flares , mm - flares would show shorter delays or possibly even peak before the @xmath0-rays .",
    "the very important second caveat is that a correlation analysis tends to measure the distance between the peaks , especially if the flares have different timescales ( as the radio and the @xmath0-ray flares tend to have ) .",
    "however , a radio flare starts to grow a considerable time before it peaks .",
    "the _ beginning _ of a millimeter flare coincides with the ejection of a new vlbi component from the radio core @xcite .",
    "this is the epoch that must be compared with the @xmath0-ray flaring , not the epoch of the radio flare maximum .",
    "the crucial question is whether a @xmath0-ray flare occurs _ before _",
    "the beginning of a mm - flare , or _",
    "after _ it ; in the former case the @xmath0-rays originate upstream of the radio core ( the beginning of the radio jet ) , in the latter , they originate downstream of the radio core , presumably from the same disturbances that produce the radio outbursts .    in this proceeding",
    "we summarize our recent results @xcite , obtained after combining the finely sampled 37  ghz metshovi light curves and the monthly binned @xmath0-ray light curves provided by the  first source catalog ( 1fgl , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by using a radio flare decomposition method",
    ", we estimate the beginning epochs of millimeter flares and their phases during @xmath0-ray flaring events to establish the true temporal sequence between @xmath0-ray and radio flaring .",
    "the metshovi quasar monitoring program currently includes about 250 agn at 37  ghz . from them , we selected a sample of sources that fulfill the following criteria : ( i ) well - sampled light curves during the period 2007 - 2010 , covering the 1fgl period , ( ii ) a firm association with the 1fgl catalogue , and ( iii ) a @xmath0-ray monthly light curve during the 1fgl period that is significantly different from a flat one .",
    "our final sample consists of 60 sources classified according to their optical spectral type as highly polarized quasars ( hpq , 22 ) , low polarization quasars ( lpq ,  5 ) , quasars without any optical polarization data ( qso ,  15 ) , bl  lac type objects ( blo ,  17 ) , and radio galaxies ( gal ,  1 ) .",
    "the sample of sources used in this work is listed in table 1 of @xcite",
    "to compare radio flux densities and @xmath0-ray photon fluxes , monthly binned radio light curves were created from the metshovi light curves .",
    "the time bins are the same as in the 1fgl flux history curves , allowing us to compare simultaneously @xmath0-ray photon flux and radio flux - density variations with the time resolution of a month .",
    "figure 1 shows that simultaneous measurements at the two bands appear to be positively correlated .",
    "however , we find significant differences between quasars and bl  lacs , which we describe below . by applying the spearman",
    "s rank correlation test , two very clear results emerge .",
    "first , there is a significant positive correlation between the @xmath0-ray photon flux and the 37  ghz flux density for quasars , while the bl  lac fluxes are not correlated .",
    "second , the strength and the significance of the correlations is different for each type of quasar .",
    "the photon flux - flux density correlation for quasars is absent for qsos , significant for lpqs , and very significant for hpqs .",
    "such a dependence on the degree of optical polarization may arise naturally if the polarization indicates the viewing angle of the jet , with sources with high optical polarization having their jets oriented closest to our line of sight ( see figure 7 in @xcite ) .",
    "the dependence of the flux - flux relation on optical polarization agrees with previous results , where it has been shown that the brightest @xmath0-ray emitters have preferentially smaller viewing angles and consequently higher doppler boosting factors ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "since @xmath0-ray fluxes and radio flux densities are significantly correlated for sources where the relativistic jet is aligned close to our line of sight , this implies that there is a strong coupling between the radio and the @xmath0-ray emission mechanisms .",
    "that the correlation is seen on monthly timescales further indicates a cospatial origin in quasar - type blazars .",
    "we have decomposed the mm light curves into individual exponential flares ( see figure 2 ) , each of which corresponds to a new disturbance created in the jet and is often detectable as a new vlbi component @xcite .",
    "we further calculate the phase of the mm - flare when the most prominent maxima in the 1fgl light curves occurred .",
    "our analysis shows that the most significant @xmath0-ray flux peaks tend to occur when a mm - flare is either rising or peaking .",
    "this indicates that the strong @xmath0-ray flares are produced in the same disturbances that produce the mm flares .    using our data",
    ", we can estimate the time delay between the time when the mm flare starts and when the @xmath0-rays peak for each source .",
    "we define the beginning of a mm flare to be : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the time of the mm flare peak and @xmath5 is the variability timescale .",
    "in other words , we define the beginning of the flare as the epoch when its flux is @xmath6 of the maximum flux , @xmath7 . for each source",
    "we estimate the time delay between the time of mm - flare onset ( green circle in figure 2 ) and when the @xmath0-ray peak occurs ( filled triangle in figure 2 ) .",
    "the observed time delay has a distribution centered around 70 days with the onset of the mm - flare preceding the @xmath0-ray peak .    after converting the time delays to linear distances from the region where the mm - outburst begins (",
    "i.e. the radio - core ) to the region of the @xmath0-ray production , our estimates lead us to conclude that in our sample the average location of the @xmath0-ray emission region is about 7 parsecs downstream the radio - core .",
    "the results presented in @xcite strongly indicate that at least for the strongest @xmath0-rays the production sites are downstream or within the radio core @xcite , well outside the blr at distances of several parsecs or even tens of parsecs from the black hole and the accretion disk . a number of papers based on _ fermi _ data have reached similar conclusions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the current agn paradigm",
    ", it is widely believed that are produced via inverse compton ( ic ) mechanisms in the relativistic jet , and the seed photons for the ic process may be provided by the jet synchrotron emission ( synchrotron self compton , ssc ) as well as by external photon sources ( external compton , ec ) such as an accretion disk , the broad - line region ( blr ) or the hot dusty torus . at the distance of 7 parsecs from the radio core  keeping in mind that the radio core itself is often at a considerable distance from the black hole ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* )  the only sources of seed photons for the ic processes are the jet itself and the dusty torus . however , there is growing evidence @xcite that the blr might extend to much larger distances than given by virial estimates ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "one possibility is that the jet drags a part of the blr whit it , see figure 3 for a sketch of an outflowing blr among the other inner agn constituents .",
    "while single zone ssc has failed to reproduce the observed @xmath0-rays @xcite and so far there are only a couple of blazars with firm detections of a dusty torus @xcite , a tentative idea to test is _ whether an outflowing blr can serve as a source of external photons to produce @xmath0-rays , even at distances of parsecs downstream of the radio - core_. in this scenario , the strong @xmath0-ray events are produced in the same disturbance that produces the radio outburst by upscattering external photons provided by an outflowing blr .",
    "the most effective way to explore any of the above scenarios ( and others ) is by modeling simultaneous , well - sampled spectral energy distributions ( seds ) @xcite following a multizone modeling approach @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent results have suggested that the more massive the black hole is , the faster and the more luminous jet it produces @xcite .",
    "therefore , a reliable estimate of the black hole masses is an essential input to theoretical models of both the shape and the variability of blazars seds .",
