    "for each lattice , we also vary the mutual shift @xmath50 as an additional parameter to find the energy minimum .",

    "[ phases ] shows that in the range of high densities of added electrons or holes , the stripe phase , correlated between the two layers by the interlayer interaction , is preferable ( in analogy to a single graphene layer@xcite ) .",
    "moderate density imbalance does not destroy this phase .",
    "if one layer is undoped , e.g. , @xmath61 , then the stripe in the other is stable for @xmath62 , but any small @xmath63 drives the systems to the hexagonal phase due to the great advantage of wigner - crystal - like ordering in layer 2 .",
    "there is a small interval of stability of square lattice cdw near @xmath64 .",
    "this structure arises because in two nearby layers the sparse packing of two interlacing hexagonal lattices , i.e. , a honeycomb lattice , means a disadvantage relative to the square , tipping the delicate balance in favor of the latter.@xcite    in most of the phase space , the hexagonal cdw is promoted by the interlayer correlation effects in contrast with single - layer graphene where the stripe cdw has been predicted.@xcite however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ zoom](d ) , the cohesive energies in the two - layer system are smaller in magnitude ( less negative ) , which is due to the detrimental effect of the stronger screening of the coulomb repulsion by the fermi sea of electrons in remote landau levels , which overcomes the stabilizing effect of the interlayer correlations .",
    "we estimate the critical temperature for each of these phases by a landau - ginzburg mean - field theory . for this",
    ", we calculate the free energy @xmath65 of electrons in the cdw state , substracting the energy of the uniform liquid , @xmath66.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] then , we analyze the temperature dependence of the free - energy difference term that is quadratic in the order parameter , @xmath67    for the stripe and square cdws , where symmetry rules out any third - order invariants of the order parameter , the cdw transition is of the second order .",
    "then , the above expression can be used to find the critical temperature @xmath10 of the phase transition : such temperature that @xmath65 becomes negative at @xmath68 .",
    "naturally , the instability is always due to the shortest few equivalent reciprocal lattice vectors . for the stripe and square phases",
    ", the above method overestimates the critical temperature , since melting would be dominated by the defects and , in ideally clean systems , the transition is of the kosterlitz - thouless type .    for the hexagonal cdw phase , symmetry allows for cubic terms in the ginzburg - landau theory . in this case",
    ", we expect the phase transition to be a weak first - order transition , so that the above procedure would underestimate its critical temperature : the @xmath10 we get corresponds to the temperature of the absolute instability of the cdw state . in the bottom half panel in fig .",
    "[ phases ] , we plot the value of @xmath10 for @xmath8 t and a barrier consisting of 12 hbn layers ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the calculated value of @xmath10 for a hexagonal cdw ( fig .",
    "[ phases ] ) is , interestingly , a nonmonotonic function of the filling factors .",
    "the second interesting feature of the two - layer hexagonal cdw is the twofold degeneracy related to the broken inversion symmetry : this degeneracy suggests the existence of two types of domains in the cdw `` crystal '' and domain boundaries , which can be pinned by disorder .",

    "[ comp ] , @xmath75 and its classical geometric capacitance @xmath76 .",
    "this results from several contributions to the chemical potential of the double - layer system , @xmath77 which includes the kinetic energy , the exchange interaction energy among the states in the deeper - lying completely filled lls , the exchange interaction of the partially filled @xmath78 and @xmath79 lls with the sea of filled lls , and the cohesive energy @xmath80 of the partially filled lls @xmath81 .",
    "figure [ comp ] illustrates the contributions of the electrons compressibility @xmath82 to the capacitance in the cdw states , for the same parameters as in fig .",
    ".    another experimental consequence of the formation of cdw states would be the reentrant integer quantum hall effect behavior of electrons in such system , determined by pinning the hexagonal cdw domains and domain walls by disorder .",

    "if one layer is @xmath38 doped while the other is @xmath83 doped ( e - h bilayer ) , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ coh ] ) changes sign .",
    "in the latter case , the cohesive energies of stripe and square / rectangular cdws for e - e and e - h layers are related , but a connection between e - e and e - h double - layer cdw with rhombic / hexagonal lattice is nontrivial ; hence , the study of the phase diagram for the e - h double - layer cdw will be reported in a separtate paper . another point to make is related to the electron tunneling between graphene flakes . in g / hbn / g heterostructures produced by mechanical exfoliation and transfer ,",
    "the graphene layers are rotationally misaligned .",
    "then , the two graphenes brillouin zones are rotated with respect to each other , displacing the dirac points on the momentum plane by @xmath84 , so that interlayer tunneling would be resonant and could affect the electron spectrum only at high energies @xmath85,@xcite irrelevant for the formation of low - energy landau levels . as a result ,",
    "even for the thinnest interlayer separation ( with only one hbn layer between graphene flakes ) , the interlayer tunneling can be neglected in the analysis of the cdw phases in the two - layer system .",
    "we have shown that the two - dimensional electron gas in g / hbn / g heterostructures in a perpendicular magnetic field has several correlated charge - density - wave phases , and the critical temperature of such ordering is in the experimentally accessible temperature range .",
