    "rotation - powered pulsars spin down gradually , torqued by their magnetospheric fields and currents . while generally highly predictable , the rotation in some of these neutron stars is occasionally punctuated by `` glitches '' , sudden period decreases caused by the irregular transfer of angular momentum from the interior to the crust or by crustal rearrangement .",
    "apart from glitches , the observed evolution of rotation is dominated by the predictable effects of electromagnetic torques , but for most pulsars there remains a seemingly random component which makes them somewhat noisy rotators .",
    "the ultimate causes of this `` timing noise '' are not understood .",
    "recently it has been shown that the timing behavior of several radio pulsars is consistent with oscillation between two discrete values of spin - down rate differing by @xmath8 , which may explain their timing noise to a significant extent @xcite .",
    "in addition , the pulse profiles show changes that are correlated with spin - down rate .",
    "this newly identified connection between torque and radiative properties may be related to the long - known but also poorly understood `` mode changing '' phenomenon , in which some pulsars abruptly change between two discrete average radio profiles @xcite .",
    "an extreme example of this behavior is apparently provided by , with two states lasting for days  weeks in which the spin - down rates differ by @xmath9  and in the low state , the pulsar ceases to emit radio pulsations altogether !",
    "the discoverers surmise that ( extra ) magnetospheric currents present in the on state are ultimately responsible for both the radio profile and the extra torque @xcite .",
    "it seems plausible that this could be linked to another long - standing mystery in pulsar phenomenology , `` nulling '' , in which the radio emission from some pulsars turns off for several rotations before resuming @xcite .",
    "extreme intermittency as displayed by  is clearly rare , but its true incidence is not known .",
    "this behavior provides a new probe of pulsar magnetospheres , and further examples may lead to a better understanding of some of these phenomena . here",
    "we report the discovery and initial study of , which turned off one year after discovery and resumed pulsations 580 days later .",
    "since the first discovery of radio pulsations from a magnetar @xcite , we had occasionally searched for radio emission from the magnetar , located at the center of the supernova remnant ( snr )  ( g27.4 + 0.0 ; * ? ? ?",
    "we had done this at the csiro parkes telescope in the 20 cm band ( 1.4ghz ) , but owing to absurdly strong radio frequency interference ( rfi ) caused by the thuraya-3 satellite , on boxing day 2008 we instead observed in the 10 cm band .",
    "we observed the position of the magnetar for 20 minutes at a center frequency of 3078mhz , using the analog filterbank / pmdaq system to sample at 1khz the total power in each of 288 channels across a bandwidth of 864mhz before recording to disk .",
    "the data were analyzed with standard pulsar search techniques implemented in presto @xcite , and a strong pulsar with period @xmath10s and dispersion measure @xmath11pc@xmath6 was easily identified .",
    "this is not the magnetar , which has @xmath12s .",
    "we confirmed the pulsar at the nrao green bank telescope ( gbt ) on 2008 december 31 with a spigot @xcite observation at 2ghz and began timing it there on a regular basis .",
    "after a couple of weeks we switched to using the guppi spectrometer , recording data from a bandwidth of 800mhz centered on 2ghz .",
    "each observation typically lasted for 5 minutes and we obtained 39 daily pulse times of arrival between 2009 january 4 and 2010 january 8 .    using tempo",
    "we determined a phase - connected timing solution for the pulsar , listed in table  [ tab : parms ] ( `` solution 1 '' ) .",
    "is located @xmath13 away from the discovery pointing position , outside the projected extent of the  snr ( see figure  [ fig : vlacxo ] ) .",
    "the timing solution contains a frequency second derivative ( where @xmath14 ) , nominally significant at the @xmath15 level , which whitens the residuals .",
    "inclusion of @xmath16 in the fit changes the values of r.a .  and",
    "@xmath17 by @xmath15 , decreases the post - fit rms residual from 1.1ms to 0.9ms , and presumably reflects timing noise in the pulsar . while the magnitude of @xmath18 suggests a large level of timing noise ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , its impact on rotation is still tiny compared to the effect of @xmath19 : during 2009 , its overall contribution to pulse phase , @xmath20 , is only 1% of @xmath21 .    we carried on studying the pulsar at the gbt during 2010 and into 2011 , but on all 28 observing dates between 2010 january 19 and 2011 july 26 ( and on three occasions at parkes ) it was never detected , even after searching the data in period  then , on 2011 august 11 , it reappeared at the gbt as bright as ever !",
    "it seems that the pulsar turned off for 1.51.6yr .",
    "the flux density for each gbt non - detection was @xmath22mjy , at least 50 times below the pulsar s average flux when emitting ( table  [ tab : parms ] ) .",
    "we do not of course know that the pulsar was off all the time during those 1.5yr , only that in every one of 28 attempts , once every 20 days on average , for 5 minutes at a time , we never detected it .",
    "conversely , we detected it on every one of the 43 days that we observed it spanning the previous 1.0yr . both of these facts are suggestive of very long continuous either on or off states .",
    "however , one atypical observation serves as a cautionary note : on 2009 december 11 ( mjd  55176 ) the pulsar was detected as usual in a 300s observation at 17.7@xmath23  ut , but in a second observation at 19.9@xmath23 it was not detected . after confirming that the equipment was working properly ,",
    "another 300s observation was done at 20.0@xmath23 and still the pulsar was not detected .",
    "finally , at 20.4@xmath23 the pulsar was detected as normal in a 300s observation .",
    "it appears that on this day the pulsar was off for between 10 minutes ( 700 rotations ) and 2.7hr .",
    "the reality is that during 2009 we observed  for a total of only 4hr mostly in @xmath24 minute sessions , or one part in 2000 of the entire year . during a portion of one daily session out of 40 ,",
    "the pulsar turned off , likely for a time amounting to a few percent of the total observing time during the year . minding the danger of extrapolating from one event",
    ", we may suppose that the pulsar actually turned off during 2009 in relatively brief episodes amounting cumulatively to @xmath251% of the time .",
    "we may also wonder whether during the overwhelmingly off state in 2010 and into 2011 the pulsar occasionally turned on .",
    "we have been timing the pulsar since it reappeared , and have detected it in all nine attempts ( once at parkes ) .",
    "the @xmath19 of the new timing solution , measured with 0.5% precision after 66 days , is the same as the one measured in 2009 ( `` solution 2 '' in table  [ tab : parms ] ) .",
    "extraordinarily , the new rotation frequency is well above that expected from the extrapolation of the timing solution in 2009 ( see figure  [ fig : timing ] and table  [ tab : parms ] ) : the @xmath26 measured in 2009 and over the past two months is 2.47 times larger than the average @xmath27 inferred for the off state , computed from the difference in rotation frequencies measured on 2011 august 11 and 2010 january 8 ( mjds  55784 and 55204 ) from the respective timing solutions , and @xmath28d . considering the actual observing dates , the off state could have been as many as 27 days shorter than this , which implies a possible @xmath19 ratio as large as 2.65 . in principle , the frequency offset in figure  [ fig : timing ] could also be interpreted as a glitch with @xmath29 , but it is rare for such large glitches to be observed in pulsars with such relatively small @xmath19 @xcite , and a glitch has never resulted in the known disappearance of pulses ( although in the young and high magnetic field psr  j11196127 , extra profile components have been detected following a large glitch ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the mostly on or mostly off states of  are contaminated by their complement , as noted in the previous paragraph , then the true value of the @xmath19 ratio would be slightly increased from the nominal value inferred . also , some of the @xmath18 fitted in 2009 might be due to contamination of mostly @xmath30 by some @xmath31 .",

    "the 2ghz profile is arbitrarily aligned with respect to the two at higher frequencies , and its pa values are essentially meaningless because of scattering .",
    "small wiggles in the off - peak region of the two high - frequency profiles are due to imperfectly removed rfi . ]    in the discovery observation of , the pulse profile appeared to be scattered by the ism , despite the high frequency of 3ghz .",
    "this huge level of scattering is confirmed at @xmath34ghz ( top panel of figure  [ fig : pol ] ) : our fitted scattering functions yield a @xmath35 scattering timescale of @xmath36s , referenced to a frequency of 1ghz  to our knowledge this is the largest for any known pulsar ( with the possible exception of the magnetar 1e1547.05408 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and 100 times larger than predicted by the @xcite electron density model . in our fits we assumed an intrinsic pulse profile made up of three gaussians with the central one dominant and its ratio compared to the other two extrapolated from the spectral evolution observed between 5ghz and 9ghz ( see below and figure  [ fig : pol ] ) .",
    "we also assumed that @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "fitting for the scattering spectral index results in a somewhat shallower frequency dependence , but the @xmath39 of the fit does not improve by much .",
    "nevertheless , it appears that a bit of scattering is still present at 5ghz ( bottom panel of figure  [ fig : rvm ] ) , which may support @xmath40 , as has been seen for other pulsars with large dm @xcite .",
    "we had not detected the pulsar at 1.4ghz ( with 288mhz of bandwidth ) on four previous occasions ( in 2006 may and 2007 june and december ) and at first assumed that this was due to scattering away , from 1998 august .",
    "in addition , the pulsar was not detected by @xcite in a 2006 november gbt search of the nearby magnetar . ] .",
    "in fact the pulsar is detectable at 1.4ghz when on , as seen in the top panel inset of figure  [ fig : pol ] . at this frequency",
    "the profile is substantially scattered by more than the rotation period  i.e. , some of the flux received at the earth is not pulsed ; however , it is intrinsically bright enough that the remaining pulsed flux is detectable .",
    "flux - calibrated observations at 2ghz , 5ghz , and 9ghz ( shown in figure  [ fig : pol ] ) yield the period - averaged flux densities listed in table  [ tab : parms ] .",
    "the uncertainty at 5ghz is from the difference of two measurements .",
    "we have no evidence for significant flux variation due to scintillation , although the 2ghz observation contains only about 300 pulses ( which may not be enough to stabilize the profile ) , and we assume a 20% uncertainty , as we do at 9ghz . while the nominal spectrum computed between 5ghz and 9ghz",
    "is steeper than at lower frequencies , the uncertainties are large enough that we can not be sure whether this is significant . in any case , @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 ) , and at 1.4ghz the predicted intrinsic flux density is about 10mjy .",
    "although the profile at 2ghz shows little sign of structure because of the long scattering tail , the 5ghz and 9ghz profiles ( lower panels of figure  [ fig : pol ] ) allow us to say a great deal about the classification and geometry of the pulsar .",
    "the polarimetric observations were all done with 800mhz of bandwidth and analyzed with psrchive @xcite .",
    "the rotation measure was determined to be @xmath3radm@xmath4 , which in absolute value is the largest known for any pulsar . at 5ghz",
    "we also detect numerous single pulses , with peak flux densities up to 200mjy , and polarization fractions ranging over @xmath43100% .",
    "the average pulse profile has three distinct components with the central one most prominent at 5ghz and significantly less so at 9ghz .",
    "the components at 9ghz are narrower than at 5ghz , possibly as a result of residual scattering at 5ghz . the outer components ( separated by @xmath44 at both frequencies ) do not flank the central component perfectly symmetrically , with the trailing edge closer .",
    "the linear polarization is moderate throughout , although characteristically absent on the leading and trailing wings .",
    "circular polarization is seen against the central component but there is no obvious sign reversal .",
    "the polarization position angle swing is complex with at least two and possibly three orthogonal mode jumps across the profile ( see figure  [ fig : rvm ] ) .",
    "rotating vector model fit to 5ghz data of .",
    "top : 2009 profile , shown in the middle panel of figure  [ fig : pol ] , zoomed in on the emission region , along with rvm curve ( green ) fitted to position angles where linear polarization signal - to - noise ratio @xmath45 ( black ) .",
    "bottom : 2011 profile , based on 50 minutes of data . for comparison ,",
    "we plot in green the rvm model obtained for the 2009 data . in neither case",
    "have the pas been rotated to the reference frame of the pulsar . ]",
    "the triple structure with a steep spectrum of the central component is characteristic of many pulsar profiles @xcite .",
    "the central component likely originates near the magnetic pole with the outer components forming a cone of emission at some reasonable fraction of the distance to the edge of the polar cap .",
    "the measured full width is some 25 .",
    "this is much larger than the @xmath46 derived under the assumption that the emission height is @xmath47 km , typical of older pulsars @xcite .",
    "this then implies that either the emission height is much larger ( greater than 1000 km ) or that the value of @xmath48 ( angle between the magnetic and spin axes ) is less than 45 .    in the middle panel of figure  [ fig : pol ] , the steep position angle of linear polarization under the main peak hints at a small impact parameter @xmath49 ( closest approach between the observer line of sight and the magnetic axis ) .",
    "however , when we look at the profiles and pas in more detail ( figure  [ fig : rvm ] ) , reality appears much more complicated .",
    "we show in the top panel of figure  [ fig : rvm ] a rotating vector model fit @xcite to 5ghz data from 2009 .",
    "the pas in the outer pulse components are apparently offset by 90  with respect to the adjoining pas in the middle component ; the fit in the middle component seems to capture the major trend of pa ( and taken at face value implies @xmath50 ) but clearly there are unmodeled details .",
    "the inadequacies of the rvm fit and complicated pa structure of the profile are seen more clearly in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : rvm ] , where we show 5ghz data from 2011 , with higher signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the rvm model shown here is the one obtained from the fit to 2009 data , and clearly does not fit well the complex progression of pa across the profile .",
    "@xcite has shown that orthogonal jumps in pa together with even modest levels of scattering can distort observed pa swings , and this may be occurring for  at 5ghz . in that case",
    ", even our supposition that @xmath49 may be small is not necessarily correct .",
    "the two 5ghz profiles differ slightly ( e.g. , the total intensity third component is relatively stronger in 2011 ; there are also slight differences in polarized flux ) .",
    "in order to investigate whether these differences are meaningful , we split the 2011 observation into two equal halves .",
    "the profiles differ from each other by more than the noise level , although by a little less than the 20092011 difference .",
    "it is conceivable that 1500 rotations are not enough to generate a stable average pulse profile .",
    "it is also possible that rfi contamination is responsible for some of these differences ( see off - pulse rfi in the middle panel of figure  [ fig : pol ] ) .",
    "further observations are required in order to reach credible conclusions concerning the stability of the  profile ( the two 5ghz and one 9ghz observations presented here are the only ones that exist at frequencies greater than 3ghz ) .      is located right on the galactic plane , at @xmath51 , and this location has been imaged multiple times at radio wavelengths . in the left panel of figure  [ fig : vlacxo ]",
    "we show the most beautiful existing image of its surroundings .",

    "the pulsar flux density is @xmath54mjy , and we estimate ( section  [ sec : pol ] ) that @xmath55mjy  when the pulsar is turned on ! evidently , when the multi - epoch vla and effelsberg observations for this image were done , the pulsar was not on .        the snr  and its magnetar have been observed with the x - ray observatory , and the new pulsar falls within the field of view .",
    "we have reprocessed two observations using the latest ciao pipeline , from which we determine an upper limit for x - ray emission from .    in a 29ks acis - i observation (",
    "obsid  729 , done in 2000 july ) , only one photon is detected in the 0.57kev range within a circle of radius @xmath56 centered on the pulsar .",
    "the background level is high due to the nearby snr , and the source falls near a chip boundary .",
    "the exposure - corrected upper limit on the 0.57kev count rate is @xmath57s@xmath58 at the 90% confidence level .",
    "a slightly better exposure - corrected 90% upper limit of @xmath59s@xmath58 is derived from a 25ks acis - s observation ( obsid  6732 , done in 2006 july ) , in which no counts are detected within the same aperture .    assuming a putative power - law spectrum with photon index @xmath60 absorbed by a column with @xmath61cm@xmath4 ( corresponding to one free electron for every 10 neutral hydrogen atoms along the line of sight )",

    "( the five non - detections in 20062007 are consistent with another off period lasting also for @xmath70 days ; see section  [ sec : pol ] . )",
    "although published details are limited , a third such pulsar is known :  @xcite was observed to turn off for about 2yr between two 1yr on phases , with a ratio of on - to - off @xmath19 of 1.7 @xcite .",
    "we do not know what causes these ( or any ) pulsars to turn off , or back on .",
    "but any plausible magnetospheric model should attempt to account for the observed on - to - off ratios of @xmath19 , which now span 1.52.5 for three pulsars .",
    "models of pulsar magnetospheres range between those that contain no plasma , where @xmath71 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , and ideal mhd plasma - filled descriptions where @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "none of these can explain actual pulsar emission : the vacuum models have no charged particles that can be accelerated and radiate , while the `` force - free '' models have @xmath73 and can not accelerate the charged particles to radiate . on the plus side ,",

    "recently , @xcite and @xcite have computed resistive solutions for pulsar magnetospheres that in significant respects lie between these extrema . associating the on state with the force - free magnetosphere and the off state with a resistive configuration ( i.e. , with a suppression of the conduction current , for unknown reasons )",

    "it seems encouraging that these advances in the treatment of pulsar magnetospheres provide a framework that may help to explain the unexpected observations of two - state @xmath19 in psrs  b1931 + 24 , j1832 + 0029 , and j18410500 .",
