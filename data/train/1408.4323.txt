    "the general catalog of variable stars lists multiple groups of pulsating variable stars of late spectral type with periods of several tens of days or longer .",
    "while historical divisions by period and spectral type were made in the absence of knowledge about stellar evolution , we now recognize that these long period variable ( lpv ) stars are evolved low- and intermediate - mass stars . during the red giant branch ( rgb ) ,",
    "asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , and post - agb phases stars are characterized by highly extended stellar envelopes providing the basis for long - period pulsation .",
    "the variability time scale of lpvs requires monitoring over years to decades to properly describe the light changes . in the 1990s long term",
    ", rapid cadence monitoring of variable stars in selected fields occurred as a byproduct of ground - based photometric surveys searching for microlensing events .",
    "this data was transformative , providing large data sets of high quality light curves for stars in the magellanic clouds @xcite .",
    "the magellanic cloud variables are at a known distance , and hence have known luminosities , permitting the construction of period - luminosity ( p - l ) diagrams for a large sample of late - type stars . while previously a p - l relation had been known for the large amplitude lpvs , the miras @xcite , period - luminosity relations for all late - type variables are apparent in the lmc data @xcite .    in this paper we focus on those lpvs that are luminous with periods of @xmath0100 days or longer but are not miras . in the parlance of the @xcite p - l relation",
    "these are sequence c and c @xcite . in the classical variable star nomenclature these are semi - regular ( sr ) variables .",
    "the gcvs classification is unfortunately blurred across a large range of temperature and luminosity with sr variables found across a large part of the cool star p - l diagram . here",
    "we will discuss those that have agb luminosity .",
    "other recent papers have discussed sr variables that are less luminous and are on the rgb @xcite .    the improved p - l diagram results in new astrophysical challenges .",
    "the c and c variables are pulsating radially in the fundamental mode , a low overtone mode , or a combination of modes .",
    "the origin of agb semi - regular behavior , both in cycle length and amplitude , remains unclear , but their light curves can in some cases be reproduced by the combination of several periods ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the major challenge , however , is an explanation of the long secondary periods ( lsp ) found in many of the overtone pulsators . with a typical time scale of several hundreds to thousands of days",
    "the secondary periods are significantly longer than the fundamental mode periods and therefore can not be explained by radial pulsation .",
    "various solutions have been discussed , but a satisfactory explanation has yet to be found ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "one route to further understanding of these stars is precision , continuous photometric monitoring .",
    "recent studies faced the typical problems of ground - based observations , time series of very limited length , of limited photometric accuracy , and observational gaps resulting from both diurnal and seasonal cycles .",
    "a space mission obtaining photometry continuously over a time span of several years is , therefore , clearly relevant .",
    "one of the many side benefits of the kepler mission was the    ortunity to obtain long and precise time series of variables , including lpvs with uninterrupted sampling extending over months .",
    "@xcite presented the first extensive study on the variability of both rgb and agb m giants using the long and continuous light curves provided by kepler . in that paper",
    "the authors focused on the global characteristics of the light variations of these cool giants .",
    "their study confirmed the presence of several pulsation modes based on the patterns seen in the petersen diagram and it revealed a clear distinction between solar like oscillations and large amplitude , mira - like pulsations .",
    "this transition seems to appear at log p(days ) @xmath0 1 .",
    "the kepler mission was optimized to search for planet transits , not slow variations spanning weeks to years . as a consequence ,",
    "the aim of our paper is twofold . in the first part",
    ", we investigate the applicability of the kepler data products to the construction of long base line light curves by combining individual data - sets of three months length .",
    "we will focus on a small sample of 12 stars , three of which have small amplitudes that are included especially to identify instrument specific effects .",
    "the light curves are then used in the second part of the paper to discuss the light change of sr variables on the basis of these uninterrupted and photometrically precise light curves .",
    "the definition of the sr variable class limits the visual amplitude to less than 2.5 magnitudes .",
    "the mira variables are defined as having visual amplitude in excess of 2.5 magnitudes .",
    "thus the sr class excludes the large amplitude , tip - agb variables .",
    "the intent of our survey was to study agb sr variables over as full a range of variability as possible .",
    "unfortunely , most sr variables have not been extensively studied in the past .",
    "the better known objects have been assigned a subclass a or b reflecting a more or less regular light curve . however , many late - type stars have time series of ground based photometry that are too short or otherwise inadequate to classify the variability .",
    "the srb class has been associated with lsp phenomenon .",
    "a sample spanning these variability classes was of special interest with the goal of seeing if actual differences existed between the subclasses .",
    "the general catalogue of variable stars ( gcvs * ? ? ? * ) list of variables in lyrae and cygnus was searched for late - type sr variables in the kepler field .",
    "other surveys , for instance the asas catalog @xcite , sample a much shorter time interval and were less useful in selecting a variety of variables .",
    "the two brightest srs in the kepler field are af cyg , an srb with spectroscopically and photometrically studied lsp @xcite , and aw cyg , a carbon - rich srb variable .",
    "observation of these two bright stars required special target pixel masks and hence were not included in our original target list . however , @xcite selected af cyg as a target and developed a special pixel mask .",
    "we included that data . to represent the sra class we identified v588 lyr , v1670 cyg , and v1766 cyg .",
    "for the srb class v1953 cyg , eg lyr , and bu lyr were selected .",
    "we included two sr stars without sub - classifications , v1253 cyg and v2412 cyg .",
    "three low amplitude variable stars located in the field of the old open cluster ngc 6791 were analyzed to test the reduction process .",
    "the stars have periods in the range @xmath010 - 20 d @xcite with amplitudes of less than 0.1 magnitude .",
    "the brevity of the ground based ngc 6791 survey results in fairly uncertain periods .",
    "the general catalogue of variable stars ( gcvs * ? ? ?",
    "* ) classifies the test stars as red giants with semi - regular periods , i.e. stars that are likely members of sequence a or b in the lpv l - p diagram .",
    "the spectral types are correspondingly earlier than for the program stars with the test stars probably on the rgb .",
    "spectroscopy was carried out to determine the spectral types for the brighter of the program stars .",
    "the observations were made at the kitt peak national observatory using the 4-meter mayall telescope in may 2011 and the coude feed telescope in october 2010 , march 2011 and may 2011 .",
    "the resulting spectral type classifications can be found in tables [ t : star_list ] . when possible these are compared to the classifications found in the general catalog of variable stars ( gcvs ) .",
    "v616 lyr was observed with the 4-meter only , v588 with both the 4-meter and the coude feed , and the other observations are from the coude feed .",
    "spectral types and luminosity classes were assigned based on @xcite .",
    "the spectral types for v616 lyr , v588 lyr , v1766 cyg and v1953 cyg are presented here for the first time .",
    "our work compares favorably with the types in the gcvs for eg lyr .",
    "however , we classified bu lyr as m4-m5 iii while the gcvs lists it as an m7 star . this could result from changes in the spectral type with the pulsation phase .",
    "this has been reported for semiregular variables by @xcite .",
    "phase dependent changes can be mitigated by repeated observations .",
    "eg lyr , bu lyr , and v1766 cyg were observed on two or more dates separated by several weeks or months .",
    "six stars in table [ t : star_list ] were too faint on the dates of our observations for spectroscopic work .",
    "spectral types were derived from v - k colors .",
    "the reddening is not known for these stars so the corresponding spectral temperatures are likely too cool .",
    "these data show that all the program sr stars are , as expected , m stars ( table [ t : star_list ] ) . the low amplitude test objects ( table [ t : star_list ] ) are earlier spectral types .",

    "it was positioned in an earth - trailing heliocentric orbit with a 372.5 days period .",
    "the data discussed here is from the original kepler mission to observe a section of the cygnus region along the orion arm centered on galactic coordinates ( 76.32@xmath2,+13.5@xmath2 ) or ra=19:22:40 , dec=+44:30:00 ( 2000 ) .",

    "the kepler observatory has two observing modes , either the short cadence mode ( sc ) recording one image every 0.98 minutes or the long cadence mode ( lc ) recording one observation every 29.4 minutes .",
    "the data were downloaded in quarterly blocks divided in monthly sections . after each of the quarterly blocks the satellite was rotated so that the next quarter was observed with a different part of the ccd array .",

    "these data are called raw .",
    "the sap data come with no correction of differences in the flux zero point between the quarterly observation blocks .",

    "the size of the window is neither the same for all stars nor necessarily constant for a given object .",
    "formats between 4@xmath33 to 13@xmath359 pixels have been found for our sample stars . for the bright target af cyg a maximum window size of 15@xmath3587 pixels was used .",
    "* superstamps : for two areas in the kepler field , around the open clusters ngc 6791 and ngc 6819 , a complete image is provided in lc mode .",
    "these `` superstamps '' are provided with the same sampling frequency as the tpd data . * full field images ( ffi ) : these were taken monthly at the end of an observation cycle .",
    "corrected flux light curves by the kasc working groups using their own specific pipelines for the data reduction are sporadically available .        to examine the shorter period astrophysical signals the instrumental effects that dominate the light curves first",
    "must be removed .",
    "in addition to zero point differences ( above ) there are also trends in the flux values within a quarter .",
    "one technique for removing these effects is ` cotrending ' , described in detail by @xcite , and based on the identification of common trends in a selected set of light curves on a given chip .",
    "cotrending is most effective at removing instrumental signal while preserving astrophysical signal for periods of a few tens of days . for the lpvs in our set , with typical periods",
    "generally greater than 100 days , limitations of the cotrending algorithm preclude reliable results .",
    "the alternative way is to leave the trends in the light curve and try to identify and remove them during period search .",
    "tests with low amplitude variables show that the first three cotrending basis vectors for each individual quarter result in a good match to the instrumentally dominated overall shape of the light curve and the thermal features .",
    "this gives us confidence that cotrending is removing instrumental effects but not introducing significant errors into the light curve .",
    "introduction of the fourth and fifth basis vector start to show overfitting of the light curves and loss of astronomical signal",
    ". however , once the individual quarters have been cotrended a significant difference between the median flux levels for each quarter remains .",
    "a significant limitation of cotrending for the lpv kepler light curves lies in preserving and identifying very long period variations where the method typically results in ambiguous conclusions .",
    "in contrast to other variable classes , the study of long period variables with kepler requires a very precise linking of the various quarters .",
    "errors introduced in linking the quarters can have a major impact on the derived long periods and their amplitudes .",
    "unfortunately , this linking is hampered by the gaps of 0.9 to 3  days in time coverage that occur between the quarters . in some cases , where the star has not been observed continuously in all quarters",
    ", very large gaps can occur .",
    "therefore , we focused in our study on the various approaches to close the gap between the quarters correctly and , if possible , in an objective , unambiguous , and easily reproducible way .",
    "first , we consider sap data . a first simple approach is to simply stick together the various quarters starting with the first one , always using the flux of the last data point of the previous quarter and the first data point of the following quarter .",
    "if cotrending was applied first , scaling of each quarter to the same median level can be used to reduce the discontinuities between the quarters .",
    "this approach is particularly helpful for faint targets where the increased scatter in the light curve complicates the scaling .",
    "one source of the differences in the flux levels stems from the variable mask sizes used to extract the photometric data for the sap light curves @xcite and the quarterly change of the ccds and their different characteristics .",
    "fortunately , the kepler archive also includes target pixel data ( tpd ) that allow one to check the automatically chosen mask for an individual star .",
    "as mentioned above , the size of the mask is not constant for the four quarters and is not always covering the target correctly . for illustration , we present some example tpd around the star v621 lyr ( kic 2570059 ) in figure[f : v621lyrtpd ] . in the four quarters q6 to q9 we see a shift of the expected center of the star indicated by the black cross and the actual central pixel . consequently the target mask , indicated by red squares , does not include the star s center . therefore , neither the sap nor the pdc light curve show the correct light variation of this star . using tpds we could correct this mismatch , and by extracting the data from missing pixels in q6 and q9 from the superstamps segment 930 ( see below ) we could even complete the tpd data set .",
    "furthermore we also extracted and added the missing quarters q2 to q5 and q10 to q13 to get a much longer time coverage for this star .",
    "as a consequence of these mismatches we decided to use a flexible aperture introducing a threshold value to select the pixels included for each individual observation .",
    "the threshold value was based on the flux of pixels not belonging to the star , which typically have significantly lower values and show almost no variation .",
    "depending on the star s position in a crowded field or not threshold values between 45 to 220e@xmath4/s give the best results . in the case of the example shown in figure[f : v621lyrtpd ] , we see that there are four to eight more pixels significantly contributing to the total light , compared with the kepler default target aperture .",
    "a careful definition of the aperture is therefore of critical importance to avoid systematic errors in the photometric data .",
    "our approach permitted us to reduce strongly the influence of the telescope jitter on the extracted light curve .",
    "figure[f : v621lyrsap ] compares the result of our approach using tpd and the sap data directly from the archive with and without amplitude rescaling .",
    "linking of the various quarters unambiguously can also remain a challenge in the case of the tpd data .",
    "a simple connecting , as described above , can lead to results that are likely incorrect .",
    "this problem occurs primarily for the gap between q7 and q8 which is much larger than the typical ones lasting for more than 15 days .",
    "here we use the light curve shape from the nearby cycles shifted to lie over the gap to estimate the needed adjustment immediately after the gap .",
    "the various sources producing the offset between quarters are a mixture of multiplicative and additive contributions that can not be disentangled . to estimate the resulting range of uncertainty we tested both approaches , i.e. a purely multiplicative and a purely additive correction .",
    "for the period determination , both methods give about the same results , but the amplitude variations are naturally different . for a low flux star like",
    "v621 lyr the amplitude difference between rescaling using a multiplicative factor or using an additive constant is about @xmath52% , whereas for a highly variable and high flux object like v1766 cyg we notice changes up to 3.76% . in the following",
    "we assume that the major effects are of multiplicative nature and use this for scaling .    while the tpd achieves a better result in some cases problems",
    "can still occur .",
    "for instance , for q6 to q9 the row of pixels adjacent to the center of v621 lyr is missing in the tpd data . in such cases",
    "the superstamps discussed in the next paragraph can provide a solution .",
    "data for missing tpd observations also can be recovered from the superstamps .",
    "the superstamps for ngc 6791 consist of 20 images of 100 x 20 pixels in the format of the target pixel data at the 29.4 minute long cadence ( lc ) intervals .",
    "several of our targets in the constellation lyra have superstamp data available .",
    "we used these data to close gaps in the time coverage of the sap and tpd light curves . to make sure",
    "we can combine the superstamp data with the other data sources we extracted quarter 10 data of v607 lyr , where we have also tpd data for the same time .",
    "the agreement is excellent .",
    "one disadvantage of this method lies in the tpd like structure of the superstamp data .",
    "for one complete set of 100 x 20 pixels only one quality flag is available , and in many cases it shows values far above the good quality limit of 1000 . for the tpd analysis we ignored all observations with non - zero quality flags . for the superstamps the same restriction results in just a handful of observations in a quarter .",
    "an acceptable solution was found by accepting observations with a summed up quality flag up to 9000 and adding some additional formal checks .",
    "for instance we remove data with zeros in the date or flux and extreme outliers identified by a two - point difference function .",
    "a few obviously wrong data still in the light curve after these checks had to be removed manually .",
    "our analysis revealed that the best way to construct complete and reliable light curves from the kepler data for long period variables is to apply a mix of methods combining various types of data provided in the kepler archive . in difference to the work of @xcite we use tpd data instead of sap data in our analysis .",
    "as a primary period search method we used classical fourier analysis combined with a least square method optimization provided by the period04 software package @xcite .",
    "the search was limited to a maximum frequency of 0.2 cycles per day , i.e. a lower period limit of 5 days . up",
    "to 4 periods were used to fit the light change .",
    "while this upper limit for the number of periods included in the model fit was set somewhat arbitrarily , it was well motivated by our experience that including further periods usually does not lead to a significant improvement of the fit .",
    "furthermore , in many of our sample srvs we observed a clear drop of the s / n ratio for additional periods in the fourier power spectrum ( see also table [ t : pstars ] ) .",
    "however , the existence of further significant periods can not be totally excluded .",
    "the fourier analysis was done on the light curves without co - trending .",
    "in addition to fourier analysis , other methods have proven useful in light curve analysis , revealing additional information beyond the periods present in the light curves @xcite . for stars with part of the fundamental group description including irregularities in the light curve autocorrelation and related self - correlation methods",
    "have been found to be useful in quantifying the cycle - to - cycle variation in addition to the finding the dominate period @xcite .",
    "a regularly periodic light curve will have strong correlations for time lags that are multiples of the period with the strength of the peak correlation staying high over many cycles .",
    "semi - regular stars will generally have a strong correlation for the first few multiples of the period but the coefficient drops off over time .",
    "the persistence of the autocorrelation can then be used as an indicator of the regularity present in a semi - regular star .",
    "light curves which have multiple periods will tend to have weaker autocorrelation peaks although there can be complex patterns emerging from the beat phenomena between the dominate periods .",
    "we performed an autocorrelation analysis based on the algorithm of @xcite .",
    "the traditional autocorrelation routine requires a perfectly evenly spaced time series , therefore we used an autocorrelation routine adapted for astronomical time series developed by matthew templeton at the aavso ( private communication ) .",
    "for the longer period sr stars , we used a lag timing step of 0.5 days and maximum lag times up to 1000 days . while lag times larger than half of the total data range have more limited accuracy , we include these longer lag times for some stars as an indication of the possible longer term behavior but always recognizing that the accuracy is diminished .",
    "the autocorrelation coefficient can range from + 1.0 for a perfectly correlated signal to -1.0 for a perfectly anti - correlated signal @xcite . in this analysis",
    "we consider a strong correlation to be one with a peak coefficient above 0.75 while levels below 0.25 are classified as weak correlation . in our analysis of these stars ,",
    "the periods found using autocorrelation are generally in agreement with the periods found through fourier analysis but we additionally comment of the regularity in the light curves as measured through the strength and persistence of the autocorrelation coefficient .",
    "the resulting periods ( numbers of brackets give the s / n ratio derived from the fourier analysis ) and supplemental data for each star are listed in table [ t : tstars ] . in the text we will refer to the periods as p1 to p4 ,",
    "listed left to right in the tables , with p1 having the largest amplitude .",
    "transformation of kepler fluxes into kepler magnitudes was done using the relation given on the kepler webpage .",
    "previous analyses of kepler data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) identified a signal of approximately one year length in most light curves .",
    "this so called  kepler - year \" of 372.5 days length has an origin that has not been fully explained .",
    "it is obviously related to the orbital motion of the satellite .",
    "focus changes due to a varying satellite temperature are a possible cause .",
    "this could be augmented by seasonal variations of the background zodiacal light .",
    "the kepler - year is prominent in our test sample variables which have low amplitudes .",
    "however , for the program stars , all of which have large amplitudes , the kepler - year has either a minor impact or could not be detected at all .",
    "we performed additional test reductions on stars in fig.5 of @xcite showing the kepler year . using tpd data instead of sap data , the kepler - year variations disappeared in five of eight stars and thus could be partly an artifact introduced by the sap reduction pipeline .",
    "a detailed investigation of this difference could shed more light on the origin of this feature in the kepler light curves but is beyond the scope of the present paper .",

    "a reason for this difference is not understood yet .",
    "the amplitude of the kepler light curve ( fig.[v621lyrplot ] ) is rather small .",
    "a one year period ( 365.31d , p1 ) is very clear but could be identical with the kepler year . a combination of p1 , p2@xmath7841.33days , and a long time trend , clearly exceeding the total length of our time series , gives a very good fit to the kepler light curve .",

    "the kepler - year artifact provides the dominant signal .",
    "figure [ vxxx_lyr_kpyri ] shows the tpd light curves for the three low amplitude test stars and the zoomed and shifted kepler background extracted from v607 lyr .",

    "various observational studies , more recently by @xcite and @xcite , have demonstrated the difference in the variability behavior between rgb stars and the more luminous agb stars .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , stability analysis of pulsation modes in red giants shows a change from higher overtone radial modes in low luminosity red variables to lower overtone radial modes in the more luminous ones .",

    "the exception is bu lyr where this is correct for only the second half of the kepler data set .",

    "the continuity and the high photometric precision lowered the noise level in the fourier power spectra significantly compared with ground - based surveys . in some cases",

    "this is in agreement with other studies that note an irregular component in the light curves @xcite .",
    "the two independent period search methods we applied lead to very similar results for period fits to the light curve .",
    "the period detection is robust for up to four periods at the precision and time span of the kepler data .",
    "there are differences between the periods detected in our study and values in the literature based on different data sets for the same star . to explore this further , we downloaded the asas data set for one of our stars , v1953 cyg , from the asas website .",
    "we selected v1953 cyg because its light curve is one of the most irregular ones in our sample .",
    "the fit produced using our kepler derived periods can be used to model almost all maxima and minima in the asas data set correctly and the combination of three periods reproduces a remarkable fraction of the changes in amplitude and period length .",
    "naturally , the photometric uncertainties of the asas measurements are much larger than those of the kepler measurements .",
    "therefore , it is not possible to test the quality of the fit of the artificial light curve with similar precision .    in the asas data base v1953 cyg",

    "attempting to fit the kepler light curve using the three periods derived from the asas light curve does not result in a good fit .",

    " 50% of stars a third long period that is @xmath09@xmath54 times longer than the dominant period can also be present @xcite .",
    "in addition , each of the two pulsation modes can be composed of multiple periods spanning a small range of values @xcite .",
    "the result is that for any given epoch the resulting light curve can appear irregular or quite periodic .",
    "an excellent example is the sra variable v1766 cyg which is described in the literature as fairly regular with a period of 119 days @xcite .",
    "this is the one star star in our program that does not have a second mode present . nonetheless during the time of the kepler observations the light curve appears to be fairly irregular",
    "this is due to the presence of a number of periods spanning the range from 104 to 122d . on the other hand ,",
    "two stars in our sample had sr : or srb classifications , v1253 cyg and v2412 cyg , which imply that historically the light curves have been irregular ( or badly sampled ) .",
    "these stars do indeed have multiple modes / periods but during the interval of the kepler observations light curves were quite regular .",

    "the sr variables in the current sample can be shown to be fundamental plus first overtone multimode radial pulsators .",

    "they have multiple periods in the dominant pulsation mode .",
    "approximately half of the stars also have a long secondary period 8 to 10 times the length of the dominant pulsation period .",

    "all the sample stars are multiperiodic with no apparent differences between the sra , srb , or sr : subclasses .",
