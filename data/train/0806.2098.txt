    "vinyl cyanide , ( vycn for short ) , also known as acrylonitrile or propenenitrile , h@xmath7c = ch@xmath9c@xmath10n or shorter c@xmath7h@xmath11cn , is an important molecule in space .",
    "it was detected in the massive star - forming region sagittarius b2 ( sgr b2 for short ) by gardner and winnewisser as early as 1975 @xcite .",
    "massive star - forming regions are comparatively dense and hot , thus , transitions of vycn in its @xmath12 and @xmath13 excited vibrational states have been detected in orion kl @xcite and in sgr b2(n ) @xcite .",
    "matthews and sears reported the first detection of this molecule in a dark cloud ( tmc-1 ) @xcite ; and very recently , agndez et al . reported its detection in the circumstellar envelope of the late - type star irc  + 10216 ( cw  leo ) @xcite .",
    "vycn had also been among the molecules whose rotational spectra were studied rather early by wilcox et al . in 1954 @xcite and by costain and stoicheff in 1959 @xcite .",
    "the latter also investigated the singly - substituted @xmath0c species as well as c@xmath7h@xmath11c@xmath1n and h@xmath7ccdcn .",
    "more recently , additional reports have been published @xcite .",
    "its dipole moment components @xcite as well as increasingly accurate @xmath14n hyperfine structure parameters @xcite have been obtained .",
    "a total of 14 isotopic species have been investigated in ref  @xcite , including all stable singly substituted ones , all multiply deuterated ones except d@xmath7cchcn , and the singly substituted @xmath0c species of h@xmath7ccdcn .",
    "the rotational constants were used to derive structural parameters according to several structural models .",
    "finally , a combined fit of these previous data was reported by thorwirth et al . in their work on the related vinyl acetylene molecule @xcite .",
    "we have carried out millimeter line observations of sgr b2(n ) with the iram 30 m telescope .",
    "these observations yielded a variety of interesting results , e.g. the first detection of aminoacetonitrile , a possible precursor of the simplest aminoacide glycine , which was secured by accompanying interferometric observations @xcite .",
    "in the course of the ongoing analyses of the observational data supplementary laboratory spectroscopic investigations have been carried out to facilitate these and future analyses .    in the present contribution",
    "we report on laboratory rotational spectroscopic investigations of the singly substituted isotopic species of vycn containing @xmath0c or @xmath1n as well as supplementary data on the main isotopic species .",
    "in addition , we present the first detection of @xmath0c containing isotopologues of vycn in space .",
    "conventional absorption spectroscopy was employed in cologne for the laboratory investigations .",
    "the measurements were carried out in a 3  m long glass cell at room temperature in a static mode .",
    "a commercial c@xmath7h@xmath11cn sample was used at pressures of less than 1  pa for stronger lines and around 2  pa for the generally weak lines .",
    "two commercial millimeter - wave synthesizers am - msp  1 and 2 ( analytik & metechnik gmbh , chemnitz , germany ) covered the 4 and 3  mm frequency ranges ( 52@xmath9119ghz ) ; because of the detector cut - off , the lowest measured line was near 64  ghz .",
    "additional measurements have been performed in the frequency range 239@xmath9351  ghz with the cologne terahertz spectrometer @xcite using a phase - locked backward - wave oscillator as source .",
    "a liquid he - cooled insb hot - electron bolometer was used as detector throughout the investigations .",
    "the uncertainties of the lines were estimated by judging the line shape and the signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "investigations , e.g. , into rotational spectra of so@xmath7  @xcite and sis  @xcite demonstrated that relative uncertainties @xmath15 of 10@xmath16 and better can be achieved up to and even beyond 1  thz in our laboratory not only for strong , but also for fairly weak , isolated lines .",
    "vinyl cyanide is a planar asymmetric top that is , with @xmath17 for the main isotopic species in its ground vibrational state , quite close to the prolate symmetric limit of @xmath18 .",
    "it has a large @xmath19-dipole moment component of 3.815  ( 12 )  d and a considerably smaller , but still sizeable @xmath20-dipole moment component of 0.894  ( 68 )  d @xcite .",
    "the @xmath14n hyperfine splitting can be resolved easily at low values of @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "it can be resolved at least in part for higher-@xmath21 values in @xmath19-type @xmath22-branch transitions when @xmath23 approaches @xmath21 @xcite , see also fig .",
    "[ vycn_lab - fig ] . in this context",
    ", it is interesting to note that gerry and winnewisser @xcite published two candidate lines for the @xmath24 , @xmath25 transition at 133180.473 and 133181.018  mhz .",
    "in fact , both lines belong to this transition ; the former is the @xmath26 hyperfine component , whereas the latter is the overlap of the @xmath27 hyperfine components . in those days , @xmath2835 years ago ,",
    "it was probably neither expected nor feasible to calculate hyperfine splitting at such comparatively high quantum numbers .",
    "selected @xmath19-type @xmath22-branch transitions of the singly substituted @xmath0c and @xmath1n isotopic species of vycn were readily found in the 4 and 3  mm regions based on the previous data .",
    "@xmath14n hyperfine splitting was resolved in part for transitions with high @xmath23 values as shown in fig .",
    "[ vycn_lab - fig ] .",
    "subsequently , selected transitions were searched for at @xmath29  ghz , around 320  ghz , and near 350  ghz .",
    "no @xmath20-type transitions were searched for specifically at lower frequencies as these were not only weak , but also their uncertainties were comparatively large initially . nevertheless , some @xmath20-type transitions could be identified for all the @xmath0c - containing species in wider scans around the @xmath19-type @xmath22-branch transitions of the main isotopic species recorded in the 4 and 3  mm regions .",
    "the measurements at higher frequencies improved the predictions for these assignments .",
    "moreover , one @xmath30 transition each was found for h@xmath7c@xmath0chcn and for h@xmath7cch@xmath0cn near 245 and 250  ghz , respectively .",
    "one should keep in mind that even though the @xmath20-type transitions of these isotopic species are considerably stronger at these higher frequencies , those of the main isotopic species in the molecule s ground and low - lying excited states are stronger , too .",
    "moreover , the number of @xmath19-type @xmath22-branch transitions increases with @xmath21 .",
    "overall , this results in a strongly increased probability for overlap of two lines or for perturbations of the apparent line positions caused by the proximity of two lines as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ vycn_iso_1 mm ] .",
    "the maximum @xmath21 values were 35 to 38 for the minor isotopic species , and the @xmath23 values reached 17 to 20 .",
    "selected transitions were recorded for the main isotopic species in similar frequency regions .",
    "the transitions were easily found because of the extensive data set from previous laboratory studies @xcite .",
    "the maximum @xmath21 and @xmath23 values were 80 and 30 , respectively .",
    "the data obtained in the course of the present investigation were fit together with previous data .",
    "uncertainties of 100  khz were given for the microwave transitions from refs .",
    "@xcite as stated in the former .",
    "average frequencies were used for the few lines that were reported in both studies , and the uncertainties were set to 70  khz .",
    "millimeter - wave transitions from @xcite quoted to 10  khz digits were given 150  khz uncertainties as stated ; those quoted to 1  khz digits were reported to be more accurate by more than a factor of 10 , suggesting uncertainties of 10  khz .",
    "while this seemed to be reasonable for essentially all transitions not affected by partially resolved hyperfine structure , 20  khz appeared to be more appropriate for those that were affected .",
    "the reported uncertainties were largely used for the experimental lines from refs .",
    "@xcite ; 50 and 5  khz , respectively , were ascribed to the data from refs .",
    "@xcite on the basis of the average residuals between observed and calculated frequencies in these two papers .",
    "very few transitions were omitted from the final fits because of large residuals .",
    "these included the weak @xmath31 hyperfine components of the @xmath32 transition for h@xmath33cchcn and h@xmath7c@xmath0chcn @xcite because trial fits with these lines weighted out not only increased the residuals of these two lines by a factor of about two but also improved the quality of the fit .",
    "the spectroscopic parameters determined for the main isotopic species are essentially the same as in ref .",
    "two additional decic and one dodecic parameters were necessary to fit the high-@xmath23 @xmath19-type @xmath22-branch transitions .",
    "initial parameters for the minor isotopic species were taken from ref .",
    "@xcite and transformed to watson s @xmath34-reduction .",
    "higher order parameters were taken from the main isotopic species and scaled by the appropriate powers of the ratios of @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "as observed previously @xcite , @xmath38 did not follow this trend .",
    "thus , @xmath39 and @xmath40 were derived similarly from the ratios of @xmath38 .",
    "the resulting spectroscopic parameters are given in table  [ spec_parameters ] .",
    "the experimental transition frequencies with assignments and uncertainties as well as residuals between observed frequency and those calculated from the final set of spectroscopic parameters are available as supplementary material ( table  s1 ) .",
    "the detailed fit files as well as related files will be available in the cologne database for molecular spectroscopy , cdms  @xcite , as will be extensive predictions of the rotational spectra .",
    "we carried out a complete line survey in the 3 mm atmospheric window between 80 and 116 ghz toward the hot core region sagittarius b2(n ) ( hereafter sgr  b2(n ) for short ) .",
    "additional spectra were also obtained in the 2 and 1.3 mm windows .",
    "the observations were performed in january 2004 , september 2004 , and january 2005 with the iram 30 m telescope on pico veleta , spain .",
    "details about the observational setup and the data reduction are given in @xcite .",
    "an rms noise level of 1520  mk on the @xmath41 scale was achieved below 100  ghz , 2030  mk between 100 and 114.5  ghz , and about 50  mk between 114.5 and 116  ghz .",
    "the overall goal of our survey was to characterize the molecular content of sgr  b2(n ) .",
    "it also allows searches for new species once all the lines emitted by known molecules have been identified , including vibrationally and torsionally excited states .",
    "we detected about 3700 lines above @xmath42 over the whole 3 mm band .",
    "these numbers correspond to an average line density of about 100 features per ghz . given this high line density , the assignment of a line to a given molecule",
    "can be trusted only if all lines emitted by this molecule in our frequency coverage are detected with the right intensity and no predicted line is missing in the observed spectrum .",
    "the xclass software ( see @xcite ) was used to model the emission of all known molecules in the local thermodynamical equilibrium approximation ( lte for short ) .",
    "more details about this analysis are given in @xcite .",
    "so far , we have identified 51 different molecules , 60 isotopologues , and 41 vibrationally / torsionally excited states in sgr  b2(n ) .",
    "this represents about @xmath43 of the lines detected above the @xmath42 level . the frequency ranges covered at 3 and 2 mm",
    "contain several hundred transitions of the three @xmath0c isotopologues of vycn .",
    "the lte modeling shows , however , that the transitions with the line strength times the appropriate dipole moment , @xmath44 , smaller than 40 d@xmath45 are much too weak to be detectable with the sensitivity we achieved and the physical parameters we explored .",
    "out of 291 transitions above this @xmath44 threshold , 194 are detected in our line survey toward sgr  b2(n ) , either well isolated or in groups , or somewhat blended with emission from other molecules .",
    "the remaining 97 transitions are heavily blended with emission from other molecules or weaker than the noise level , and can not be identified in our spectrum .",
    "the detected transitions are listed in table  s2 of the supplementary material . to save some space , when two transitions have a frequency difference smaller than 0.1 mhz which is not resolved in our astronomical data , only the first one is listed .",
    "the transitions are numbered in col .  1 , and",
    "their quantum numbers are given in col .",

    "the frequencies , the frequency uncertainties , the energies of the lower levels in temperature units , and the @xmath44 values are listed in col .  4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 , respectively .",

    "table  [ t : vycn13c30mmodel ] shows the parameters of our best - fit lte model of the @xmath0c isotopologues of vycn as well as the parameters of our best - fit lte model of vycn itself .",
    "the detected transitions are grouped into `` features '' as listed in col .",
    "9 of table  s2 of the supplementary material , a feature being an observed line containing one or more ( overlapping ) transitions of the @xmath0c isotopologues of vycn .",
    "there are 89 features detected toward sgr  b2(n ) , 10 of which look relatively free of contamination and an additional 16 are only slightly blended with emission from other molecules .",
    "the remaining 63 features are blended with emission from other molecules but with the @xmath0c isotopologues of vycn contributing significantly ( at least @xmath46 ) to the peak intensity according to our lte modeling .",

    "[ vycn_obs - fig ] .",
    "the synthesized spectrum corresponding to the three @xmath0c isotopologues of vycn is plotted in red , while the model including all molecules is overlaid in green .",
    "we derived the model parameters shown in table  [ t : vycn13c30mmodel ] from all the constraints provided by the transitions of the @xmath0c isotopologues but also from the main isotopic species which we easily detect in our survey in the ground state and in several vibrationally excited states ( belloche et al .",
    ", _ in prep .",
    "_ , see also @xcite ) .",
    "the strongest velocity component is detected at 63  km  s@xmath47 and corresponds to the so - called `` large molecule heimat '' ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the second velocity component at 73  km  s@xmath47 is weaker , but still obvious in many transitions of the main isotopologue in the ground state and in the @xmath12 and @xmath13 vibrationally excited states .",
    "it is also detected in many transitions of the @xmath0c isotopologues ( e.g. in feature 16 of fig .",
    "[ vycn_obs - fig ] ) .",
    "the third ( wing ) component at 55  km  s@xmath47 is much weaker .",
    "it is well seen in many transitions of the main isotopic species of vinyl cyanide and is ( barely ) detected in feature 44 of @xmath0ch@xmath7chcn , but it is too weak to be detected in all other @xmath0c isotopologue transitions covered by our survey .",
    "the maximum opacity of the @xmath0c isotopologue transitions is 0.5 in our lte model .",
    "therefore these transitions are optically thin and the source size and column density are degenerated . on the other hand many transitions of the main isotopic species are optically thick , which allowed to derive the source size , once a good estimate of the temperature had been obtained .",
    "the same source size was used for all @xmath0c isotopologues .",
    "finally , no attempts were made to fit the transitions in the 1.3  mm window since the line confusion is much more severe and the position of the baselines much more uncertain .",
    "in addition , our lte model predicts emission line intensities stronger than observed for many molecules in this window .",
    "apart from the uncertain baselines , the level of which is likely to be overestimated because of line confusion , we suspect that the dust emission is optically thick in this window and affects significantly the line emission from the compact hot cores , but we have not tried to model this effect so far .    finally , we searched for c@xmath7h@xmath11c@xmath1n in our survey toward sgr  b2(n ) but did not detect this isotopologue . using the same source size , temperature , and linewidth as for the @xmath0c isotopologues , a column - density upper limit of @xmath48 @xmath5 could be derived in the lte approximation . from a tentative detection of the @xmath1n isotopologue of cyanoacetylene hc@xmath11n in our survey toward sgr  b2(n ) ( belloche et al . , _ in prep . _ ) , we derive a @xmath0c@xmath14n/@xmath8c@xmath1n ratio of about 15 , while wilson and rood @xcite mention a ratio larger than 30 for the galactic center region . in any case , the column - density upper limit derived here for c@xmath7h@xmath11c@xmath1n is consistent with both values .",
    "the hyperfine parameters are largely determined by the data published in ref .",
    "@xcite ; additional information obtained in the present work for the isotopic species with @xmath0c or previously for the main isotopologue @xcite have very small effects .",
    "omission of one hyperfine component each for h@xmath33cchcn and h@xmath7c@xmath0chcn actually increased their uncertainties of @xmath49 and @xmath50 slightly and changed their values by an amount slightly outside the combined uncertainties .",
    "the mechanical parameters for the main isotopic species agree very well with those determined in a recent combined fit @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties in the present work are somewhat smaller despite using three additional distortion parameters .",
    "these parameters are of the right order of magnitude when compared with the lower order parameters .",
    "three of the off - diagonal octic distortion terms ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 ) are barely determined .",
    "nevertheless , they were retained in the final fit as their values seemed to be of the correct order of magnitude . moreover , omitting any one of these parameters deteriorated the fit slightly and had only modest effects on the remaining parameters .",
    "the values of the higher order distortion parameters should be viewed with some caution as additional experimental transition frequencies and the inclusion of still higher order terms may affect their values somewhat outside the reported uncertainties .",
    "considerably more distortion parameters have been determined for the minor isotopic species in the present work compared with the previous study of colmont et al .",
    "because of the change in reduction a direct comparison is not always possible . however , @xmath54 and @xmath38 are very similar in a near - prolate top as vycn .",
    "their estimates of the former agree very well with the presently determined @xmath38 value , even in the case of the @xmath1n species for which we did not observe @xmath20-type transitions .",
    "the distortion parameters of the minor isotopic species are very close to those of the main isotopic species as one would expect because the rotational constants are also quite similar .",
    "the use of higher order parameters transfered from the main isotopic species and kept fixed in the analysis may seem excessive at first sight , in particular if one keeps in mind that some of these are comparatively uncertain .",
    "however , most of the fits for the minor isotopic species were performed without the parameters higher than those of octic order ( the @xmath55s ) . in those fits ,",
    "the values for @xmath56 were much smaller than that of the main isotopic species ( by about a factor of 1.5 ) whereas those for @xmath57 were much larger in magnitude than that of the main isotopic species ( by about a factor of @xmath58 ) . with estimates for these high - order parameters included in the fit the values for @xmath56 and @xmath57 changed only barely from those of the main isotopologue if the uncertainties are taken into account .",
    "we have detected the three @xmath0c isotopologues of vinyl cyanide toward sgr  b2(n ) .",
    "although many transitions are blended with emission from other molecules , 26 features have been found completely free of contamination or only slightly contaminated .",
    "the emission arises from several velocity components .",
    "the two velocity components at 63 and 73 km  s@xmath47 were also detected by belloche et al .",
    "@xcite with the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) and the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) in ethyl cyanide c@xmath7h@xmath59cn , cyanoacetylene hc@xmath11n and its isotopologue hc@xmath0ccn in their @xmath60 excited states , and methanol ch@xmath11oh in its excited state @xmath61 .",
    "the small source size derived here ( 2.3@xmath62 ) is consistent with the size of the vycn emission detected with bima by liu and snyder @xcite ( see their figure 2a ) and with the similar fluxes detected by friedel et al .",
    "@xcite with bima and the nrao 12 m telescope ( only 10@xmath63 of the 12 m flux is missed by bima ) .",
    "this source size is also similar to the one measured for aminoacetonitrile @xcite .",
    "therefore , the emission of vycn and its @xmath0c isotopologues arises mainly from the two compact hot cores separated by about 5.3@xmath62 in the north - south direction .",
    "these two hot cores are not spatially resolved with the iram 30 m telescope but are clearly separated with interferometers like the pdbi and the atca .",
    "the main one with a velocity of 63  km  s@xmath47 corresponds to the so - called `` large molecule heimat '' ( lmh for short ) .",
    "the third velocity component , identified at 55 km  s@xmath47 , most likely corresponds to the blueshifted linewing detected with the pdbi in cyanoacetylene hc@xmath11n ( see fig .",
    "5 m of @xcite ) , and may be associated with an outflow .",
    "we derived a column density of @xmath64 @xmath5 for the main velocity component of vycn which corresponds to the lmh ( see table  [ t : vycn13c30mmodel ] ) .",
    "this value is a factor of 3 - 4 larger than the one calculated by liu and snyder @xcite , which is not surprising since they analyzed their spectrum of vycn at 83.2  ghz assuming optically thin emission whereas our lte modeling indicates an optical depth of @xmath282.3 for this transition in our survey .",
    "in addition , they may not have taken into account the contribution of the low - lying vibrational modes to the partition function as was done here ( about 25@xmath63 ) .",
    "the temperature derived from our lte analysis ( 170  k ) is in good agreement with the temperature measured by ikeda et al .",
    "@xcite for their vycn transitions observed with the nobeyama radiotelescope ( @xmath65  k ) . on the other hand ,",
    "no evidence for a high - temperature component ( 440  k ) was found for the main isotopologue in its ground vibrational state in the present survey in contrast to what was reported by nummelin and bergman @xcite .",
    "since the column densities of vycn and its @xmath0c isotopologues have been independently measured here , the @xmath8c/@xmath0c isotopic ratio of vycn can be calculated from the column - density ratio . as a result",
    ", we find a @xmath8c/@xmath0c isotopic ratio of 21 for vycn , which is fully consistent with the standard value listed by wilson and rood for the galactic center @xcite .    with a mean h@xmath7 column density of @xmath66  @xmath5 @xcite , a relative abundance of @xmath67 is derived for vycn in the lmh , and @xmath68 for each of its @xmath0c isotopologues .",
    "the abundance of vycn derived here is more than one order of magnitude larger than the abundances recently found by fontani et al . in a sample of massive hot cores @xcite .",
    "we also detect the @xmath0c isotopologues of ethyl cyanide ( c@xmath7h@xmath59cn , etcn for short ) in our survey of sgr  b2(n ) .",
    "rest frequencies were taken from the cdms  @xcite ; the entries were based on the laboratory data from ref .",
    "the latter work also reports the detection of @xmath0c isotopologues of etcn for the first time in space .",
    "the current lte analysis of our sgr  b2(n ) survey ( belloche et al . , _ in prep . _ ) shows that the detected lines are optically thin , with opacities smaller than 0.4 . for the main velocity component of each @xmath0c isotopologue",
    ", a column density of @xmath69  @xmath5 is found with a source size of 3@xmath62 derived from the detected etcn lines and a temperature of 170  k. in the lte approximation , the contribution of the low - lying vibrational modes to the partition function is estimated to be about 40@xmath63 at 170 k , which yields a total column density of @xmath70  @xmath5 for the @xmath0c isotopologues of etcn .",
    "therefore , the column - density ratio of the @xmath0c isotopologues of vycn to the @xmath0c isotopologues of etcn is @xmath71 in the lmh , which is in good agreement with what liu and snyder @xcite found for the @xmath8c species .",
    "however , they may not trace the same material in this source since the vycn emission looks single - peaked in interferometric maps while the etcn emission is definitively double - peaked ( see @xcite and fig .",
    "5h of @xcite ) .",
    "for the second velocity component corresponding to the northern hot core in sgr  b2(n ) , we find a column density of @xmath72  @xmath5 for the @xmath0c isotopologues of etcn with a source size of 2.3@xmath62 and a temperature of 170  k. after correction for the contribution of the low - lying vibrational modes , the total column density is about @xmath73  @xmath5 .",
    "this gives a column - density ratio @xmath74 for the northern hot core of sgr  b2(n ) .    in hot cores , etcn is thought to evaporate from the dust grains where it was formed and to subsequently form vycn through gas - phase reactions @xcite . in the dynamical - chemical calculations of caselli",
    "@xcite modeling the gas phase and surface chemistry in a collapsing core with a density of 10@xmath75 @xmath76 and a temperature of 200  k , the abundance ratio @xmath22 of vycn to etcn increases initially with time as vycn is progressively produced from etcn , reaches a maximum of about 0.5 , and then starts to decrease when the abundances of many complex molecules also drop .",
    "this ratio @xmath22 may therefore be used as a chemical clock @xcite .",
    "the ratio @xmath77 found here for the lmh is even larger than the maximum predicted by the model .",
    "fontani et al .",
    "@xcite mentioned that the model may underestimate the production of vycn ( thus @xmath22 too ) due to a missing reaction of etcn with h@xmath11o@xmath78 in the chemical network .",
    "if we take the large value found in lmh as the true maximum , then the age of the lmh is @xmath79  yr since the beginning of the evaporation of the grain mantles in the framework of this model .",
    "on the other hand , the ratio @xmath22 about 4 times smaller found for the northern hot core suggests that it is at a different evolutionary stage than the lmh , either younger ( @xmath80  yr ) or older ( @xmath81  yr ) , depending on whether it is before or after the peak of @xmath22 .",
    "we note however that the h@xmath7 density in the lmh is about @xmath82 @xmath76 @xcite , which is one order of magnitude larger than the density assumed by caselli et al .",
    "@xcite for their model .",
    "the chemical timescales may therefore be shorter in the lmh than in the model , and the ages determined above may be overestimated .",
    "very accurate transition frequencies have been obtained for five isotopic species of vycn in their ground vibrational states within the millimeter - wave domain .",
    "the resulting spectroscopic parameters are accurate enough to identify the minor isotopic species in the interstellar medium or circumstellar envelopes up to about 700  ghz .",
    "this corresponds approximately with the foreseen upper frequency limit of alma of 720  ghz which may even be extended up to around 950  ghz later .",
    "on the other hand , none of the high frequency molecular line surveys of orion  kl carried out with comparatively large ( @xmath2810  m ) single dish telescopes covering the frequency regions @xmath83  ghz @xcite , @xmath84  ghz @xcite , and @xmath85  ghz @xcite revealed any features of the main isotopic species of vycn while even vibrationally excited vycn was observed in the @xmath86  ghz survey @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is not clear at present if the minor isotopic species of vycn will be observable with alma in its highest frequency bands ; however the expected very high sensitivity and spatial resolution may make this fairly likely .",
    "because of previous laboratory data  @xcite , predictions for the main isotopic species should be reliable up to at least 1  thz .",
    "the current data significantly improve the predictions for the weaker lines .",
    "extensive predictions of the rotational spectra will be available in the cdms  @xcite for all these species .",
    "these predictions will be a contribution to minimize the so - called `` weed problem '' , that means that features of abundant molecules in space , such as vycn , may prevent weaker features of desired molecules to be identified unambiguously unless sufficiently weak features of the more abundant species are known accurately enough .",
    "the `` weed problem '' is of particular concern for radiotelescope arrays such as the sma or , even more so , for alma .    with the accurate transition frequencies obtained in the present work",
