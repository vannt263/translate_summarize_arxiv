    "for centuries , physicists have been intrigued by the concepts of rotation .",
    "galileo galilei , vincenzo viviani , isaac newton , jean bernard lon foucault , ernst mach , albert einstein , george sagnac , hans thirring , josef lense , hermann weyl and kurt gdel form an impressive line of researchers trying to gain insight into this problem .",
    "key ideas such as inertial forces , mach s principle , frame dragging , gravito - magnetism , compass of inertia and rotating universes are intimately connected with these pioneers . even today , there are still many open questions . one of them is related to the meaning of mach s principle and best described by the following quote from james a. isenberg and john a. wheeler @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` mystic and murky is the measure many make of the meaning of mach''_. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the present lecture notes start from a brief historical development of the notion of rotation and then focus on the sagnac effect as a tool to measure rotations .",
    "moreover , we bring out some of the alien features of the gdel universe by presenting computer visualizations of two scenarios .      during a service in the great cathedral of pisa galilei",
    "made a remarkable discovery watching the chandeliers swinging in the wind .",
    "the period of a pendulum is independent of the amplitude of its oscillation . as a clock",
    ", he used his pulse .",
    "had the church service lasted longer , he might have noticed what his student viviani mentioned later @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` ... all pendulums hanging on one thread deviate from the initial vertical plane , and always in the same direction .

    "viviani s observation was rediscovered by foucault in 1851 .",
    "he was the first to interpret this phenomenon as a consequence of the rotation of the earth relative to the absolute space of newton .",
    "a new era in the investigation of rotation was ushered in by the development of general relativity .",
    "stimulated by mach s criticism of newton s rotating bucket argument @xcite , the question whether rotations should be considered as absolute or relative motions was one of the principles guiding einstein in his formulation of general relativity  @xcite .",
    "however , he was not the first to be inspired by mach s ideas .",
    "for the contributions of the brothers benedikt and immanuel friedlnder we refer to @xcite .",
    "einstein s theory of general relativity made it possible for the first time to analyze mach s principle in a mathematically rigorous way .",
    "thirring and his coworker performed this task in 1918 and addressed the questions : are there coriolis- and centrifugal - like forces in the center of a rotating hollow sphere ? and , does the rotation of a solid sphere influence the motion of a nearby body by `` dragging forces '' not present in newton s theory ? according to general relativity",
    "the answer to both questions is yes .",
    "however , the expected effects were experimentally not accessible at that time .",
    "nevertheless , there were early experiments aiming at the measurement of `` dragging forces '' in arnold sommerfeld s institute in munich .",
    "according to otto scherzer @xcite , a former assistant of sommerfeld , an experiment was set up to measure the influence of a heavy , rotating sphere on a foucault pendulum .",
    "unfortunately , the mass , which weighed a few tons , fell off the device driving the rotation , and started running around in the lab . the experiment was aborted .",
    "we emphasize that the results of thirring and lense did not imply that mach s principle is fully incorporated in the theory of general relativity , as  e.g.  discussed by hermann weyl @xcite . due to the intriguing , but vague formulation of mach s principle",
    ", the controversy is still ongoing @xcite .    in 1949",
    "a new issue in the study of rotation within general relativity emerged from a remarkable discovery by the ingenious mathematician gdel . trying to explain   the observed statistical distribution of the angular momenta of galaxies @xcite , gdel found an exact cosmological solution of einstein s field equations @xcite whose energy - momentum tensor corresponds to a homogeneous and rotating ideal fluid .",
    "today , we refer to this solution as gdel s universe .",
    "gdel soon recognized that his solution exhibits a very puzzling property , namely the existence of closed timelike world lines .",
    "this feature which is incompatible with the common notion of causality forced him and many others to a `` in - depth reconsideration of the nature of time and causality in general relativity '' @xcite . until this fateful discovery it had been tacitly assumed , that einstein s field equations might automatically prevent themselves from pathologies of this kind .",
    "moreover , gdel noticed that his solution was not in agreement with cosmological observations .",
    "indeed , it could not explain the expansion of the universe , which was commonly accepted after the discovery of hubble s law @xcite in 1929 .",
    "this disagreement caused him to search for a cosmological solution which exhibits both features : rotation and expansion .",
    "only one year later , gdel published a new solution @xcite which satisfied both requirements .",
    "george  f.  r.  ellis @xcite described the influence of gdel s contributions to the progress of general relativity as follows :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _",

    "represent a living testimony to the outstanding experimental progress in tests of general relativity .",
    "three domains of physics come to mind : ( i ) solid state devices are at the very heart of the gravity probe b experiment @xcite , ( ii ) laser technology is put to use in the laser ranging to the lageos satellites @xcite , and ( iii ) modern astronomy made the recent observation of the relativistic spin precession in a double pulsar possible @xcite .",

    "we study the influence of rotation on the propagation of light . here",

    "therefore , our first aim is to develop a measurement procedure relying solely on local measurements which properly separates the different sources of rotation . throughout our analysis ,",
    "we concentrate on a description which is geared towards a one - satellite - experiment .",
    "we assume that all the necessary sagnac interferometers are contained within a single satellite , so that we can locally expand the metric around its world line . with @xmath0 being a small , global perturbation of the flat spacetime metric @xmath1",
    ". however , we can apply this approximation only when the underlying spacetime is nearly flat everywhere .",
    "otherwise , some peculiarities concerning the coordinates might occur . in order to illustrate this point , we take the two - dimensional surface of a sphere with the usual metric induced by its embedding in the three - dimensional euclidean space . in this case",
    "no coordinates can cover the whole surface and allow for a decomposition of the metric into a dominant flat euclidean part and a small correction to it .",
    "such a decomposition only exists , when we restrict the coordinates to a small region on the surface using e.g. riemann normal coordinates .",
    "thus , in order to keep our considerations of the sagnac effect as general as possible , we pursue in sect .  [ properrefsagnac ] an approach which does not rely on a background metric .",

    "the first version states that _ `` the universe , as represented by the average motion of distant galaxies does not appear to rotate relative to local inertial frames '' _ @xcite . in other words , within our current universe the inertial compass is not rotating relative to the stellar compass . this claim has been tested experimentally to a high accuracy . however , in connection with general relativity , it rules out certain cosmological solutions of einstein s field equations in favor of other ones .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that for a static spacetime which is endowed with a timelike , hypersurface orthogonal killing vector field , the inertial compass does not rotate relative to the stellar compass provided both , the observer as well as the celestial bodies follow the integral curves of the killing field @xcite . for stationary spacetimes whose timelike killing vector field is not hypersurface orthonormal , the inertial compass will rotate with respect to the stellar one . since static spacetimes constitute a very special class of solutions of einstein s field equations , the coincidence of inertial and stellar compass is a rather exceptional case in general relativity .",
    "therefore , it is remarkable that this version of mach s principle fits perfectly with our observations .",
    "a second version , that we would like to mention here , reads : _ `` local inertial frames are affected by the cosmic motion and distribution of matter '' _ @xcite .",
    "in fact , this formulation of mach s principle also holds true in general relativity since the cosmic energy and momentum distribution influences the whole spacetime metric directly via einstein s field equations .",
    "the lense - thirring effect may serve as a prominent example : in case the earth would not rotate with respect to the asymptotically flat metric at spatial infinity , the inertial and the stellar compass would coincide .",
    "but since the earth rotates it gives rise to a rotation of the inertial compass relative to the stellar compass , as mentioned above in the context of the gravity probe b experiment .",
    "the third version of mach s principle brings forward a keen and suggestive idea : _ `` inertial mass is affected by the global distribution of matter '' _ @xcite .",
    "this formulation does not apply to general relativity , since the inertial mass takes the role of an independent quantity in this theory . by no means",

    "we start by briefly recalling the metric coefficients and some properties of the rotating reference frame in flat spacetime , thereby making use of the corresponding light cone diagram .",
    "we then assign a proper reference frame to an observer at rest , analyze his acceleration and the corresponding tetrad rotation and deduce the general sagnac time delays for our deli , eq .",

    "we obtain the transformed line element @xmath264 we emphasize , that the metric coefficients in the rotating reference frame do not depend on time , and therefore satisfy the assumptions used in the derivation of the sagnac time delay  ( [ gensagnactimedelay ] ) .      in order to give a first impression of the propagation of light within a rotating reference frame",
    ", we present a light cone diagram which is the collection of the `` infinitesimal '' light cones attached to every point @xmath17 in spacetime .",

    "the construction of such a diagram is briefly discussed in appendix  [ minkowskiform ] . in short ,",
    "the  infinitesimal \" light cones are established by the set of all tangents to the null geodesics through @xmath17 , since these null geodesics represent the actual trajectories of all freely propagating light rays through @xmath17 . in general , the `` infinitesimal '' light cones tilt and",

    "however , when we increase the radial position of the light cones , they start to tilt and narrow due to the rotation of our chosen reference frame .",

    "neither a massive particle nor light is able to stay at rest at a fixed position @xmath271 in this rotating reference frame since the spacetime curve @xmath272 then becomes spacelike .",
    "hence , a rotating reference frame can not be established globally using massive particles or light rays .",

    "nevertheless , we offer some reasonable arguments why gdel might have become interested in this topic @xcite .",

    "in princeton he became a close friend of albert einstein , with whom he frequently shared the walks home from the institute .    in september 1946",
    "einstein received a letter from george gamov who argued that the galaxies seem to have more angular momentum than predicted .",
    "the underlying model is based on the assumption that galaxies were formed by fluctuations of an initial uniform matter distribution .",
    "gamov suggested as a possible explanation a rotation of the universe @xcite .",
    "moreover , he wondered whether anyone had considered anisotropic solutions of einstein s field equations which would describe a rotating and expanding universe .",
    "einstein approached this idea with skepticism and in his answer to gamov he pondered : `` what does it mean , that the universe as a whole possesses an angular momentum ? '' .",
    "it is very likely , that einstein discussed the ideas of gamov with gdel on one of their walks .",
    "nearly three years later , on may 7th , 1949 gdel reported in his `` lecture on rotating universes '' @xcite at the institute for advanced studies about his results concerning a new type of cosmological solution of einstein s field equations .",
    "he summarized his results in a seminal paper published in `` review of modern physics '' @xcite on the occasion of albert einstein s 70th birthday , as well as in the `` library of living philosophers '' @xcite .",
    "moreover , gdel improved his original model by including an expansion of the universe while preserving intrinsic rotation @xcite .",
    "we start our discussion of gdel s universe by introducing its metric .",
    "in contrast to the line element presented by gdel in his original paper @xcite , we take advantage of the slightly modified expression @xcite @xmath298 where the parameter @xmath299 has the dimension of a length .",
    "this form brings out most clearly the interesting property that gdel s spacetime approaches the line element of minkowski spacetime in the limit of small radii @xmath300 .",
    "a rather lengthy calculation shows that the metric coefficients arising from the line element , eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) , indeed solve einstein s field equations @xmath301 with the energy - momentum tensor @xmath302 of an ideal fluid . as a result , the mass density @xmath13 , the pressure @xmath14 and the cosmological constant @xmath12 are directly coupled to the parameter @xmath303 via the two constraint equations @xmath304    the particles of the ideal fluid travel along the world lines @xmath305 , with @xmath8 being their proper time and @xmath306 their fixed spatial positions .",
    "therefore , the coordinates used in the line element ( [ metric ] ) are adapted to the reference frame in which the particles of the ideal fluid are at rest . as a result",
    ", the four - velocity of the fluid particles which appears in the energy - momentum tensor @xmath307 simply reads @xmath308 .",
    "an important characterization of timelike vector fields such as @xmath309 can be obtained by the scalar volume expansion , the shear tensor and the rotation tensor @xcite .",
    "although we will make no further use of these important quantities within our lecture notes , we want to briefly mention , that the volume expansion as well as the shear tensor vanish for the velocity field of the ideal fluid in gdel s universe .",
    "however , the rotation tensor is non - zero and it displays a constant rotation of the ideal fluid around the @xmath262-axis .",
    "the magnitude of this rotation is most conveniently expressed in terms of the so - called rotation scalar , which reads in gdel s universe @xmath310    moreover , it can be shown that gdel s universe admits five independent killing vector fields , which we specify in appendix  [ appkillings ] .",
    "in particular , the existence of a timelike killing vector field implies the stationarity of gdel s spacetime .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the killing vectors shows that gdel s metric is spacetime homogeneous and rotationally symmetric , but neither static nor isotropic .",
    "the latter feature becomes obvious when we recall the rotation of the ideal fluid about the @xmath262-axis .",
    "as in the case of the rotating reference frame , we take advantage of a light cone diagram to gain insight into the causal structure of gdel s universe .",
    "figure  [ lightconediaggoedel ] displays infinitesimal light cones attached to several spacetime points .",
    "again , we have suppressed the @xmath262-axis in the figure .     and @xmath311 , and one time coordinate @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath262-coordinate has been suppressed . on two planes of constant coordinate time",
    "we show the light cones for three typical separations @xmath312 from the origin . within the inner circle",
    "the light cones behave approximately like in a rotating reference frame in flat spacetime .",
    "the next circle corresponds to the gdel radius @xmath313 , which divides the plane into two different domains . here",
    "the light cones touch the plane of constant coordinate time . on the outer circle the light cones fall through this plane and therefore allow for closed timelike curves .",
    "time travel is possible as indicated by the spiral connecting the two planes.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    at the origin @xmath314 the light cone coincides with the one in flat spacetime .",
    "this feature is in agreement with the limit @xmath315 in eq .",
    ", as mentioned in the previous subsection",
    ". moreover , the gdel universe possesses a non - diagonal metric element which couples the angular and the time coordinate , thus leading to a tilting of the light cones for increasing radius .",
    "we have noticed this behavior already for the light cones in the rotating reference frame . however ,",
    "now the light cones do not narrow with increasing radius , but broaden . indeed , this behavior is of crucial importance for the world lines the fluid particles to be timelike @xcite .    this combination of broadening and tilting has a dramatic consequence illustrated by the outer circle in the fig .  [ lightconediaggoedel ] .",
    "it enables the light cones to intersect the plane of constant coordinate time @xmath47 along a closed circle in the @xmath316-@xmath317-plane , and thus leads to the formation of closed timelike world lines @xmath318 for @xmath319 .",
    "the transition between the inner region , where the light cones do not cut through the plane of constant coordinate time @xmath47 and the outer region where they do , happens at the so - called critical gdel radius @xmath313 which is indicated by the middle circle .",
    "even more mind - boggling is the possibility to travel along a timelike world line from any spacetime point to any other one .",
    "for example , if we start our journey at the origin @xmath314 of the upper plane of constant coordinate time shown in fig .",
    "[ lightconediaggoedel ] and seek to travel back to the origin @xmath314 of the lower plane , we first follow a timelike world line leading from the origin to a point beyond the critical gdel radius . the coordinate time along this world line",
    "will of course increase during the first part of our journey . after crossing the critical gdel radius ,",
    "we take a sharp turn to the `` left '' in the spacetime diagram , fig  [ lightconediaggoedel ] , and follow the spiral curve down to earlier coordinate times . having completed our journey into the  past of coordinate time \" , we take another `` left '' turn which brings us back to the origin @xmath314 , but now in the lower plane of constant coordinate time .",
    "although gdel was the first to point out the existence of closed timelike world lines within the framework of general relativity , his universe is not the only model which allows for such peculiar features .",
    "the rotating kerr black hole  @xcite and the van stockum dust cylinder  @xcite are two out of many other prominent examples which admit closed timelike world lines .",
    "the existence of closed timelike world lines implies the breakdown of our familiar notions of time , chronology and causality .",
    "but in most cases it is possible to bring up reasonable arguments which may appease our concerns .",
    "they might even lead us to abandon these peculiar solutions of einstein s field equations and mark them as toy models .",
    "however , a general theorem which rules out the possibility of creating a time machine is still missing , although much effort has gone into achieving this goal from first principles . in this context a time machine has to work within a local region of spacetime starting from a well - behaved metric such as the robertson - walker metric .",
    "moreover , it has to result from a physically reasonable energy - momentum tensor .",

    "this enormous increase in sophisticated methods in computer graphics has been made possible by a steadily growing computer power . in this section",

    "standard ray tracing is done in flat spacetime and can be performed with ease . since in general relativity spacetime",
    "is curved ray tracing of such phenomena is more complicated .",
    "for example , ertl @xcite demonstrated how to use ray tracing to visualize aspects in astrophysics , whereas weiskopf @xcite have developed a ray tracing method to visualize caustic surfaces generated by a gravitational lens . in this section",
    "we visualize several scenarios of the gdel universe @xcite . in order to gain better insight into the origin of the physical phenomena brought to light in these visualizations",
    ", we also discuss some important aspects of the null geodesics in the gdel s universe .",
    "the way how we perceive our environment visually is determined by the way how light propagates and interacts with the surrounding objects .",
    "a complete simulation of such a problem would take a great effort even on modern computers and thus can not be carried out .",
    "however , we can obtain acceptable results if we perform various approximations in the light propagation and the interaction of the light with the scattering objects .",
    "for example , it may suffice to describe the propagation of light within ray optics . from this point of view",
    ", light can be regarded as a bundle of rays , emitted from a light source and bouncing around between the objects of the scenery .",
    "unfortunately , very few of these light rays eventually hit the eye of an observer or a camera .",
    "for the simulation it would be more efficient to only take that light into account which finally passes through the aperture of the camera .",
    "therefore , it is advantageous to consider the light rays as originating from the camera and then meandering through the scenery .",
    "this approach is in accordance with fermat s principle .",
    "the path of the light between two points @xmath340 and @xmath18 is given by the shortest distance between @xmath340 and @xmath18 measured in wavelength .",
    "since the distance between @xmath340 and @xmath18 is equal to the distance between @xmath18 and @xmath340 the paths of propagation are identical .",
    "for this reason we can trace the light back from the camera via the scattering objects to the light source .    in order to bring out the essential ingredients of this idea we consider a pinhole camera . this device is a dark box with a little hole in the front as depicted on the left in fig .",
    "[ pinhole_camera ] .",
    "the light emitted or scattered by the objects propagates through the pinhole and illuminates the film in the back of the box at the corresponding positions .",
    "a few light rays on the left of fig .",
    "[ pinhole_camera ] illustrate the functioning of the pinhole camera .    in ray tracing",
    "we follow the light from the camera to the object rather than from the object to the camera .",
    "we construct rays from inside the box through the pinhole and extend them to the scenery .",
    "the intersections of such rays with an object define the surface patch which emits the light rays emerging through the pinhole .",
    "an appropriate but finite amount of rays is necessary to obtain an image .",
    "however , in order to improve the quality of the image we can take into account the surface properties of the objects such as the color .",
    "an even simpler version of this method emerges by considering the image plane to be located between the objects and the camera as shown on the right of fig .",
    "[ pinhole_camera ] . with this virtual plane an image of the scenery",
    "is rendered by tracing back a bundle of rays originating from a given point .",
    "this source of rays is reminiscent of the hole of the camera . since the camera itself is dispensable , it is omitted from the picture .",
    "since a computer can only trace a limited number of rays , the image plane is divided into small rectangular domains which can be regarded as the pixels of a computer screen . during the rendering process",
    "an individual ray is constructed and traced back through each of these tiles .",
    "moreover , we determine how this particular tile needs to be colored .",
    "this method of composing an approximate image of the scenery is the most elementary version of ray tracing .",
