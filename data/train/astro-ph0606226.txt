    "if during largest solar flare , of a few minutes duration , ( 1 ) the particle flux escaping the corona eruption and hitting later on the earth , is 3 - 4 order of magnitude above the common atmospheric cr background ( while showing similar spectra ) and ( 2 ) if the flare particle interactions on the sun corona is taking place as efficiently as in terrestrial atmosphere , than their secondaries by charged pions and muons decays , are leading to a neutrinos fluency on earth comparable to one day terrestrial atmospheric neutrino activity @xcite .",
    "one therefore may expect a prompt increase of neutrino signals of the order of one day integral events made by atmospheric neutrinos . in sk detector the signal is just on the edge , but as long as the author is aware , it has been never revealed .",
    "sun density at the flare eruption might be diluted and pion production maybe somehow suppressed ( by a factor ( 0.1 - 0.05 ) ) .",
    "this may be the reason for the null detection of huge event on oct - nov .",
    "2003 and jan . 2005 .",
    "unfortunately the neutrino signal at hundred mev energies is rare while the one at ten mev or below is polluted by solar hep neutrinos or , in sk , by local neutrino reactor noise .",
    "therefore solar flare expected signal ( at softer spectra ) maybe dominated by @xmath15 mev neutrinos ( made by non - relativistic pion decays ) that might be better revealed by their anti - neutrino signature : it will be enhanced by gadolinium presence in next sk detectors @xcite .",
    "indeed anti - neutrino electron imprint in solar flare may be well observable while searching for supernova relic anti - neutrino traces in the universe @xcite .",
    "the prompt sf signal may overcome the atmospheric noise just as the tau air - shower may overcome atmospheric muons @xcite .",
    "there are two different sf ( solar flare ) neutrinos(see @xcite ) : a brief and sharp solar flare , originated within the @xmath16 corona and a diluted and delayed @xmath17 neutrino flux , produced by flare particles hitting the earth s atmosphere .",
    "we consider only the first .",
    "the main source of pion production is @xmath18 ; @xmath19 at the center of mass of the resonance @xmath20 ( whose mass value is @xmath21 mev ) . as a first approximation the total pion @xmath22 energy is equally distributed , in average , in all its final remnants : ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26):@xmath27",
    ". the flavor oscillation will lead to a decrease in the muon component and to a hardening of electron neutrino component spectra . while at the birth place the neutrino fluxes by positive charged pions @xmath28 are @xmath29:@xmath30:@xmath31 @xmath32 , after the mixing assuming a number redistribution we expect @xmath29:@xmath30:@xmath31 @xmath33 . on the other side for the anti - neutrino fluxes we expect at the birth place : @xmath34:@xmath35:@xmath36 @xmath37",
    "while at their arrival ( within a similar flavor redistribution ) : @xmath34:@xmath35:@xmath36 @xmath38 .",
    "we considered the solar flare neutrino events due to these number fluxes following known @xmath10-nucleons cross - sections at these energies @xcite,@xcite,@xcite at super - kamiokande ii , finding a detectable signal : @xmath39 ( for more details and explanations see @xcite ) . however the event expectation numbers at sk - ii for _ solar neutrino burst _ assuming a more pessimistic detector thresholds calibrated with the observed supernova 1987a event fluxes @xcite is just at the detection edge compatible with null sk discover : @xmath40 ; @xmath41 ; @xmath42 ; where the efficiency factor @xmath43 .",
    "the background due to energetic atmospheric neutrinos at the japanese detector is nearly @xmath44 event a day corresponding to a rate @xmath45 : the probability to find by chance one neutrino event within a @xmath46 minute @xmath47 in that interval is @xmath48 . for a poisson distribution",
    "the probability to find @xmath49 events in a narrow time window might reach extremely small values : @xmath50 therefore just a few events correlated to a solar flare will be a meaningful signal opening a window to novel neutrino astronomy ."
