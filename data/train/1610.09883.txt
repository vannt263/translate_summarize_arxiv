    "there exists @xmath82 such that system has a solution @xmath19 defined on @xmath30 such that : + @xmath83 @xmath5 and @xmath6 blow up in finite time @xmath21 simultaneously at one blowup point @xmath7 and only there .",

    "the initial data for which system has a solution blowing up in finite time @xmath21 at only one blowup point @xmath7 and verifying is given by formula , which is expressed in the original variables as follows : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is given by , @xmath95 and @xmath96 are positive constants fixed sufficiently large , @xmath97 and @xmath98 are parameters in our proof , and @xmath99 with @xmath100 $ ] and @xmath101 on @xmath102 $ ]",
    ".    we will only give the proof when @xmath103 .",
    "indeed , the computation of the eigenfunctions ( lemma [ lemm : diagonal ] ) of the linearized operator @xmath104 defined in and and the projection of on the eigenspaces ( lemma [ lemm : defprojection ] ) become much more complicated when @xmath105 .",
    "besides , the ideas are exactly the same .",

    "the only available proof for the genericity is given by herrero and velzquez @xcite for the case of equation in one - dimensional case . as in @xcite , a first step towards the genericity of the profile is to classify all possible asymptotic behaviors of the blowup solution of which was established in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) in the case when @xmath11 .",

    "our proof uses some ideas developed by merle and zaag @xcite and bricmont and kupiainen @xcite for the equation .",

    "for the parabolic equations , we would like to mention the work by masmoudi and zaag @xcite ( see also the earlier work by zaag @xcite ) for the complex ginzburg - landau equation with no gradient structure , @xmath142 where @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 satisfying @xmath146 there are also the works by nguyen and zaag @xcite for a logarithmically perturbed equation of ( see also ebde and zaag @xcite for a weakly perturbed version of ) , by nouaili and zaag @xcite for a non - variational complex - valued semilinear heat equation , or the recent work by tayachi and zaag @xcite for the nonlinear heat equation with a critical power nonlinear gradient term , @xmath147 when @xmath148 , this equation is reduced to @xmath149 which is studied in @xcite .",
    "there are also the cases for the construction of multi - solitons for the semilinear wave equation in one space dimension by cte and zaag @xcite , for the wave maps by raphal and rodnianski @xcite , for the schrdinger maps by merle , raphal and rodnianski @xcite , for the critical harmonic heat flow by schweyer @xcite and for the two - dimensional keller - segel equation by raphal and schweyer @xcite , ghoul and masmoudi @xcite .",
    "one may think that the method used in @xcite and @xcite should work the same for system perhaps with some technical complications .",
    "this is not the case , since the fact that @xmath150 breaks any symmetry in the problem , and makes the diffusion operator associated to not self - adjoint . in other words ,",
    "the method we present here is not based on a simple perturbation of the equation treated in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more precisely , our proof relies on the understanding of the dynamics of the selfsimilar version around the profile . in the setting ,",
    "constructing a solution for satisfying is equivalent to construct a solution for such that @xmath151 satisfying such a property is guaranteed by a condition that @xmath152 belongs to some set @xmath153 which shrinks to @xmath154 as @xmath155 ( see definition [ def : va ] below for an example ) . since the linearization of system around the profile @xmath156 gives @xmath157 positive modes , @xmath158 zero modes , and an infinite dimensional negative part ( see lemma [ lemm : diagonal ] and remark [ rema:012 ] ) , we can use the method of @xcite and @xcite which relies on two arguments : + - the use of the bounding effect of the heat kernel ( see proposition [ prop : dyn ] ) to reduce the problem of the control of @xmath152 in @xmath159 to the control of its positive modes . note that the linearized operator around the profile , that is @xmath104 defined in and , is not self - adjoint .",

    "in particular , we have to overcome the following challenges :    * finding the profile @xmath162 is not obvious , in particular in determining the values of @xmath163 given by , which is crucial in many algebraic identities in the rigorous analysis .",
    "see section [ sec : forap ] for a formal analysis to justify such a profile .",

    "note that our definition of @xmath164 is different from that of @xcite . here",
    ", we follow the idea of @xcite to find out such an appreciated definition for @xmath164 . in particular , it comes from many relations in our proof , one of them is related to the dynamics of the linearized problem stated in proposition [ prop : dyn ] . * a good understanding of the dynamics of the linearized operator @xmath165 of equation around the appreciated profile @xmath166 given in and is needed , according to the definition of the shrinking set @xmath164 .",
    "because the behavior of the potential @xmath167 defined in inside and outside the _ blowup region _ is different , the effect of the linearized operator is therefore considered accordingly to this region . outside the _ blowup region _ , the linear operator @xmath165 behaves as one with fully negative spectrum , which greatly simplifies the analysis in this region ( see section [ sec : outerpart ] ) .",
    "inside the _ blowup region _ , the potential @xmath167 is considered as a perturbation of the effect of @xmath104 , therefore , a good study of the spectral properties of @xmath104 is needed .",

    "+ - section [ sec : dyn ] is central in our analysis .",

    "+ - in section [ sec : stab ] , we give the proof of theorem [ theo2 ] .",
    "since its proof is a consequence of the existence proof ( part @xmath84 of theorem [ theo1 ] ) , thanks to a geometrical interpretation of quantities of blowup parameters whose dimension is equal to the dimension of the finite dimensional problem , we only explain the main ideas of the proof there .",
