    "the resulting locus becomes a lambert @xmath0 function of the polar coordinate @xmath5 departing from the origin .",
    "this problem raises as a natural continuation from the nice fact that in the drag - free case such a locus is an ellipse@xcite with an universal eccentricity @xmath6.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ projectilemotion ] , the set of maxima for projectile trajectories moving under in the presence of air resistance is presented . in section [ solutionlambert ]",
    "we find a closed form , in polar coordinates , to express such a geometrical place , @xmath7 . in section [ param ]",
    "we present a numerical calculation of the curvature of @xmath7 using the polar angle and the launch angle as parameterizations . additionally , we demonstrate that the synchronous curve is a circle as in the drag - free case in section [ synchronous ] . in section [ conclusions ]",
    "we conclude .",
    "several approximations in order to consider the air resistance exist in the literature , the simplest is the linear case . in such a case",
    "the force is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the mass of the projectile and @xmath10 is the drag coefficient .",

    "the polar expression of @xmath7 can also be written in terms of the tree function @xmath62 , giving @xmath63 we recover the drag - free result = 2 [ ellipse0 ] when @xmath64 .",
    "an explanation of this unfamiliar form of an ellipse is given in appendix [ appendix1 ] followed by a discussion about the @xmath64 limit of expression ( [ w1 ] ) in appendix [ appendix2 ] .",

    "even when it is possible to write the locus in terms of @xmath65 this form does not shows the formal elegance of relation ( [ w1 ] ) .     as a function of the launch angle @xmath3 for two different values of @xmath66 and their inverses . ]",
    "now we return to equation ( [ angleeq ] ) since we need to solve explicitly it in order to have the function @xmath67 .",
    "this task is not trivial since even when we approximate the rhs in expression ( [ angleeq ] ) up to first order in @xmath66 , @xmath68 the inversion is not easy .",

    "however , the series does not converge for values in the argument larger than @xmath71 .",
    "the reason is the small convergence ratio for the taylor expansion of @xmath72 .    an easier way to perform the inversion is to evaluate @xmath73 using eq .",
