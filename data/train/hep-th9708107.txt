    "in 1992 de vega and woynarovich constructed the first example of an integrable spin chain with alternating spins of the values @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite on the basis of the well - known @xmath6 model .",
    "we call this model @xmath7 .",
    "it contains two real coupling constants @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "most authors have limited their study to positive values for them . in our series of papers @xcite",
    "we have studied the @xmath7 model in the whole @xmath8-plane and determined the ground state by thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) for equal signs of couplings and for competing interactions in the case @xmath9 . we have found four regions with different ground states .",
    "two of them contain only strings with infinite fermi zones , they include the sectors with equal signs of the couplings and are well studied .    in this paper",
    "we want to deal with the remaining case of competing interactions for @xmath2 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after having reviewed the definitions in section 2 we start our analysis with tba in section 3 .",
    "we restrict ourselves to special values of the anisotropy @xmath2 and perform the analysis of the takahashi conditions .",
    "the tba equations are given explicitly . in section 4",
    "we discuss them with respect to the values of the couplings @xmath3 and @xmath4 , what leads to the ground state phase diagram , which contains a new region with strings having infinite fermi zones . in this region the velocities of sound for the two physical excitations",
    "are calculated in section 5 , while section 6 contains our conclusions .",
    "we found it necessary to use the abbreviations i , ii and iii for our papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite respectively .",
    "we refer the reader to papers @xcite and i for the basics of the model .",
    "our hamiltonian of a spin chain of length @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 with the two couplings @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "the anisotropy parameter @xmath12 is limited to @xmath13 .",
    "for convenience we repeat the bethe ansatz equations ( bae ) , the magnon energies and momenta and the spin projection . @xmath14",
    "@xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17",
    "following our paper i we assume that the solutions of ( [ bae ] ) are of the string - type in the thermodynamic limit @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the real center of the string , @xmath20 is the string length and @xmath21 the parity of the string with values @xmath22 .",
    "the last term is a correction due to finite size effects .",
    "these strings have to obey the takahashi conditions @xcite @xmath23 substituting ( [ string ] ) into ( [ bae ] ) and taking the logarithm yields @xmath24 with the known notations @xmath25 @xmath26 and @xmath27 here we have used that a given string length @xmath28 corresponds to a unique parity , what is a consequence of ( [ cond ] ) .",
    "the numbers @xmath29 are half - odd - integers counting the strings of length @xmath30 .    introducing particle and hole densities in the usual way we perform the limiting process @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the convolution @xmath34 and @xmath35    the sign @xmath36 results from the requirement of positive densities in the non - interacting limit .",
    "we are now able to express energy , momentum and spin in terms of the densities via ( [ en ] ) , ( [ mom ] ) and ( [ spin ] ) .",
    "the standard procedure leads to equations determining the equilibrium state at temperature @xmath37 ( tba equations ) : @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 again the free energy can be expressed in terms of our new variables @xmath41 : @xmath42    in i we analysed tba equations for @xmath43 integer , @xmath44 , where strings    1 .",
    "@xmath45 , 2 .",
    "@xmath46    occur .",
    "the equations obtained allow the complete discussion of the ground state properties for values @xmath47 . on the other hand",
    "the picture for @xmath2 is still not fully clear .",
    "for this reason we want to investigate the case @xmath48 this restricts @xmath12 to @xmath49 .",
    "the analysis of ( [ cond ] ) then leads to three takahashi zones with    1 .",
    "@xmath50 , 2 .",
    "@xmath51 , 3 .",
    "@xmath52 .",
    "the operator @xmath53 ( [ tbae ] ) now has to be reversed by @xmath54 where @xmath55 the reversed tba equations read @xmath56 with @xmath57 and the fermi function @xmath58    this system of equations looks very similar to equations ( 3.17 ) in i. in both cases only the strings with takahashi indices @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 ( @xmath62 in i ) can occur in the ground state . notice that the @xmath63-strings and the @xmath64-strings have interchanged their positions in i(3.17 ) and ( [ invtbae2 ] ) .",
    "to obtain the ground state one has to carry out @xmath65 in ( [ tbae ] ) and ( [ invtbae2 ] ) . eliminating the strings which are not relevant for the ground state one arrives at the systems @xmath66 or equivalently @xmath67 here for the sake of clarity we have labelled the strings by their lengths and parities instead of takahashi indices",
    "@xmath68 denote positive and negative parts of @xmath69 respectively .",
    "the functions newly introduced are defined via their fourier transforms and are given in the appendix .",
    "it is remarkable that these equations are valid for the whole region @xmath70 though they are obtained relying on the tba for @xmath71 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the relevant part of the string picture does not change passing the point @xmath72 , what can easily be checked by performing the takahashi analysis for @xmath73 .",
    "now one can discuss ( [ -eq ] ) and ( [ + eq ] ) with respect to the signs of @xmath3 and @xmath4 for @xmath70 .",
    "* @xmath74 + the solution can be given explicitly .",
    "we have @xmath75 this is the solution of de vega and woynarovich @xcite . * @xmath76 + from ( [ -eq ] ) we have @xmath77 .",
    "therefore we find the following integral equations for the two relevant functions @xmath78 and",
    "@xmath79 : @xmath80 ( the definition of @xmath81 is repeated in the appendix . ) from these equations it can be seen that for vanishing positive part of @xmath82 the solution discussed in i is reproduced .",
    "the borderlines of this sector are found in ii . beyond this line",
    "@xmath82 is positive in an intervall @xmath83 .",
    "@xmath84 is called the fermi radius .",
    "it increases moving counterclockwise towards the line @xmath85 , where it reaches infinity ( see figure [ pf ] ) .",
    "* @xmath86 + from ( [ + eq ] ) we see that the solution can only be selfconsistent , if @xmath87 holds",
    ". one is left with the integral equations @xmath88 for @xmath89 and @xmath79 .",
    "we want to discuss the case @xmath90 first .",
    "then the solution reads @xmath91 the sector where this solution exists is given by the requirements @xmath92 while the latter condition is always fulfilled we expect restrictions on the values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 coming from the first one",
    ". putting @xmath93 yields @xmath94 for @xmath95 we look at the asymptotics @xmath96 this yields @xmath97 the more restrictive one of the inequalities ( [ in1 ] ) and ( [ in2 ] ) marks the borderline of the investigated sector .",
    "noticing @xmath98 @xmath99 and @xmath100 we conclude the following : the region with infinite fermi zones for 1-strings with different parities is given by equation ( [ in1 ] ) for @xmath71 and by equation ( [ in2 ] ) for @xmath101 .",
    "below the line specified by ( [ in1 ] ) and ( [ in2 ] ) respectively @xmath89 is positive in an intervall @xmath83 for @xmath49 , while it is positive for @xmath102 for @xmath103 .",
    "@xmath84 is again called the fermi radius . moving counterclockwise in the @xmath8-plane from the line ( [ in1 ] ) or ( [ in2 ] ) , @xmath84 increases ( decreases ) until @xmath89 is completely positive and the solution from i",
    "is reproduced ( see figure [ pf ] ) .",
    "the borderline of this sector is again given in ii .",
    "for @xmath72 no region with finite fermi zone for ( 1,+ ) exists .",
    "the phaselines coincide at this point ( see figure [ pf ] ) .",
    "this , together with the results from i and ii , allows us to give the phase diagram in the sectors with competing interactions , i.e for different signs of the coupling constants ( see figures [ p+- ] and [ p2- ] ) .",
    "the sectors are labelled according to table [ t ] and are different with respect to the string - contents .",
    ".[t]sectors appearing in the phase diagram for competing interactions .",
    "upper indices indicate infinite and finite fermi zones . in the latter case ,",
    "the second index distinguishes , wether the filling starts at @xmath93 or @xmath104 . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "next we deal with the region specified by equations ( [ in1 ] ) and ( [ in2 ] ) .",
    "the dressed energies are given by ( [ sol ] ) .",
    "the dressed momenta can be easily found noticing @xmath105 therefore from ( [ sol ] ) the dispersion relation @xmath106 follows with the speed of sound @xmath107 the dispersion relation for the @xmath108-strings is given implicitly by ( [ sol ] ) together with ( [ dremom ] ) .",
    "the speed of sound then reads @xmath109 it vanishes on the sector border ( [ in2 ] ) for @xmath101 .",
    "now it is natural to look for possible lines of conformal invariance which must have @xmath110 , with the solution @xmath111.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] analytical and numerical estimates show that there is always a solution fulfilling ( [ in1 ] ) and ( [ in2 ] ) .",
    "we have investigated the @xmath7 model in the region of anisotropy @xmath70 by means of tba .",
    "the integral equations describing the ground state change drastically when passing the point @xmath112 . while in the case of equal signs of the coupling constants this is of no influence on the ground state ( what is already known from @xcite,@xcite ) , in the case of competing interactions the picture changes .",
    "the most striking consequence is the existence of a new region with strings @xmath108 and @xmath64 having infinite fermi zones in the sector @xmath113 , which contains also a new line exhibiting conformal invariance . outside this region , finite fermi radius for the @xmath108-strings occurs .",
    "here the model behaves similar to the one investigated in @xcite and @xcite .    in the sector @xmath114 the strings @xmath63 and @xmath64 interchange their behaviours compared to @xmath9 , i.e. now the @xmath64-strings occur with finite fermi zone , while the @xmath63-strings always have an infinite one .    in sectors",
    "iii and vi , where the filling for the @xmath108- respectively @xmath64-strings starts at infinity , this causes the appearance of two different speeds of sound for each of them , to be calculated at @xmath115 and @xmath104 .",
    "it seems worthwhile to investigate these new regions in the sectors of competing interaction with respect to the excitations .",
