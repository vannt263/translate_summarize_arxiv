    "cell migration is a fundamental biological process involved in morphogenesis , tumor spreading , and wound healing @xcite .",
    "one of its most spectacular instance is cell crawling , which is crucial to immune cells in order to reach an inflammation spot , but is also observed e.g. in tumor cells during metastasis formation @xcite . identifying key mechanisms involved in cell migration is then a major issue both for our fundamental understanding and for clinical research .",
    "we focus here on cells crawling on a flat substrate , without any external cue .",
    "this type of movement occurs in several steps : protrusion of the cell at the `` leading edge '' ( led by actin polymerisation ) , adhesion to the substrate , contraction and translocation of the cell body .",
    "however , if the notion of `` leading edge '' is clear for cells undergoing persistent motion ( as in the chemotaxis phenomenon ) , the relation between protrusive activity and directionnality in more general cases is still unresolved . indeed",
    ", migrating cells might transiently polarize - a front and a back appear .",
    "if such ability is weak , the resulting motion is close to random .",
    "this polarity is reflected at the molecular level by a restriction of certain molecules to particular regions of the inner cell membrane .",
    "for example , the activated forms of rac and cdc42 molecules are found at the front of the cell , whereas rhoa molecules are found toward the rear ( see e.g @xcite ) .",
    "it is known that this asymmetry results from strong feedbacks exerted between these signaling pathways and mechanical elements @xcite .",
    "self - polarisation is then a multiscale phenomenon for which modeling efforts can bring new insights @xcite .",
    "integrated models has been succesfully developped for adressing the issue of motile cell shape , in particular for the keratocyte @xcite .",
    "computational models allow for in silico experiments and direct comparison with experimental measures ( see @xcite , and more generally @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , it has been highlighted in @xcite that redundant minimal mechanisms exist to ensure a motile stable shape for the keratocyte .",
    "self - polarisation has led to computational models investigating the role of contraction , adhesion and actin polymerisation for keratocytes or epithelial cells , providing useful predictions and allowing confrontation with experimental data @xcite .",
    "other mechanochemical models were built to perform in silico experiments ( @xcite ) , but they remain unable to provide a minimal framework to explain the persistence issue in cell motion .",
    "recently , in @xcite , it was shown experimentally that cell persistence is correlated to the flow of actin filaments from the front to the back of the motile part of the cell , as protrusions with faster actin flows are more stable in time .",
    "it was also shown that faster actin flows generate steeper gradients of actin - binding proteins .    in this work ,",
    "we study a conceptually minimal model for polarity initiation and maintenance based on an active gel description of the actin cytoskeleton , and its interaction with molecular signaling pathways .",
    "more precisely , we use a rigid version of the model first proposed in @xcite that we enrich , in the spirit of @xcite , with a feedback loop between actin polymerisation locations and polarity markers , that are advected by a dynamic actin cytoskeleton undergoing flows at the cellular scale .",
    "this minimal model allows us to obtain qualitative results on cell persistence .",
    "we analyse the long time asymptotics of the model .",
    "the principal goal of our analysis is to identify regimes in which non homogeneous stationary states , that will be interpreted as polarized states , emerge .",
    "the main ingredients of the model are as follows .",
    "we assume that there exists a mesoscopic length scale , small compared to the cell but large compared to individual molecules at which the properties of the cytoskeleton and of the solvent , which constitutes the cell , can be described by continuous fields @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we describe the actin cytoskeleton as a 2d darcy flow , bounded by a membrane with a given shape .",
    "we assume that the relevant dynamics is sufficiently slow to neglect elastic effects .",
    "actin is assumed to polymerize at the membrane and to depolymerize uniformly at a constant rate in the interior of the cell .",
    "moreover , polymerisation is assumed to depend on the concentration of a marker that is advected by the actin flow itself .",
    "finally , since we focus here on cell crawling on a flat substrate , the main external force arising is friction with the substrate .    the markers , whose density is denoted @xmath0 , are assumed to diffuse in the cytoplasm and to be actively transported along the cytoskeleton .",

    "indeed a strong instability drives the system towards an inhomogeneous state and blow - up corresponds to the case where the drift becomes infinite .",

    "we analyse with full details the one - dimensional case . in section [ sec : ode / pde ] , we briefly study a model with exchange of markers at the boundary in the one - dimensional case .",
    "our purpose in this section is to derive the model given by equations - - which describes the behaviour of an active viscous fluid featuring the cytoskeleton .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional layer of viscous fluid , representing the cell cytoskeleton , surrounded by a rigid membrane .",
    "following @xcite , to model actin polymerisation and depolymerisation , we add active properties to the viscous fluid .",
    "the first active property we consider is the out - of - equilibrium polymerisation of the fluid . in a cell , actin monomers",
    "are added to actin filaments by the consumption of the biological fuel atp .",
    "other proteins regulate the nucleation and polymerisation of actin filaments .",
    "it is commonly observed that actin polymerisation activators such as wasp proteins preferentially locate along the cell membrane @xcite .",
    "for this reason we suppose that the fluid is polymerised at the membrane .",
    "the main novelty of our work relies on the coupling between actin polymerisation and a biological marker which is transported by actin flows .",
    "its aggregation in a part of the membrane characterizes the rear of the cell , hence its polarisation .",
    "this marker could be an antagonist to polymerisation - inducing molecules ( rac1 , cdc42 ) , such as rhoa , arpin , or even myosin ii ( see @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore polymerisation is balanced by depolymerisation , which we assume to occur uniformly at a constant rate in the cell body , to ensure the renewal of ressources for polymerisation .",
    "polymerisation and depolymerisation induce an inward flow which rubs on the substrate .",
    "this friction is responsible for the cell displacement .",
    "[ fig : ucsp ]     more precisely , we consider an active darcy flow , which models the actin cytoskeleton , inside a ( moving ) domain @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a disc of radius @xmath44 .",
    "the domain moves by translation with a velocity @xmath45 .",
    "we introduce the fluid pressure @xmath46 , and @xmath47 the actin filaments velocity .",
    "finally , we denote @xmath48 the concentration of molecular marker .",
    "all these quantities are defined for @xmath49 and @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that the fluid density @xmath50 is constant in time and space .",
    "then , the fluid problem writes @xmath51 the boundary condition accounts for polymerisation at the edge of the cell , while @xmath52 describes depolymerisation in the cell body .",
    "note that equation is similar but different from the model first introduced in @xcite . indeed in our case the polymerisation is modeled through a pressure term and not a velocity one .    in the limit of low reynolds number , viscous forces dominate over inertial forces and the navier - stokes equation simplifies to the force balance principle : @xmath53 where @xmath54 , the stress tensor , is given by @xmath55 with @xmath56 being the viscosity . since the layer is placed on a substrate , we consider a friction force @xmath57 where @xmath58 is an effective friction coefficient .",
    "following @xcite , we neglect viscosity arising from the polymer - polymer and polymer - solvent friction forces and consider the limit @xmath59 .",
    "this reduces to @xmath60 notice that the pressure , hence the friction force , acts for the integrity of the fluid ( no phase separation ) .",
    "if we were considering a deformable cell , see @xcite , it would have been natural to assume that the pressure @xmath61 satisfies @xmath62 in @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the curvature of @xmath65 and @xmath66 is the superficial tension of the cell membrane .",
    "here we consider a caricatural situation since we assume that the cell domain is non - deformable and we do not impose any additional condition on @xmath61 on the boundary of @xmath67 .    about the polymer density : this model can be derived from a more realistic one , where polymerisation and depolymerisation locally modify the polymer density .",
    "more precisely , write @xmath68 where @xmath69 denotes the region occupied by the cytoskeleton . to account for polymerisation that takes place at the edge of the cell and which consists in a local increase in actin concentration , we impose on the cell membrane a jump on the actin concentration :    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is a small parameter and @xmath72 a constant .",
    "one can also assume that the polymerisation rate is a continuous non - zero polar function in an annulus initially defined as @xmath73 , of width @xmath74 , see e.g @xcite .",
    "as it is classical , see @xcite , in addition , we assume that @xmath61 is a function of @xmath75 : @xmath76 we then get the following problem : @xmath77 formally the limit @xmath78 of the previous model leads to the poisson problem .",
    "this amounts to saying that the osmotic pressure @xmath61 ensures at all time that the polymer density stays constant .",
    "the rigorous justification of this limit is not our purpose here , and will be the object of a future work .    finally , we have to prescribe the domain velocity arising from friction forces .",
    "since the gel layer is at mechanical equilibrium , the cell moves as a consequence of the inside flow rubbing on the substrate , hence we will consider a moving domain .",
    "friction forces occur at the microscopic scale , and mesoscopic tension forces also are at play .",
    "however , for the sake of simplicity , we will neglect this heterogeneity to consider a global friction coefficient @xmath79 .",
    "we write for all @xmath5 @xmath80    the main novelty of our work is to consider that @xmath81 is a function of @xmath82 , the concentration of a biological marker .",
    "this marker is assumed to diffuse and to be transported by the actin filaments , modeled by the previously described fluid . at the boundary , we prescribe a zero flux condition to ensure mass conservation .",
    "the corresponding problem writes @xmath83 with the zero - flux boundary condition @xmath84 where @xmath10 is the outward unit normal to the boundary .",
    "the zero flux boundary condition ensures that the total mass is preserved : @xmath85 .",
    "the non - deformability of @xmath67 is an important downside of the model , that conceals fundamental modelisation issues .",
    "indeed , the cell velocity is defined globally , preventing the description of local effects : experimentally , it is observed that the activity of the cytoskeleton deforms the membrane , leading to a displacement while exerting a geometric feedback on actin flows .",
    "notice that our choice for the friction force amounts to consider friction arising from both the retrograde flow and the displacement , but their effects on the equations are the same in 1d .",
    "hence , the role of motion in the initiation and maintenance of polarisation can not be investigated properly , but this will be studied in future works in 2d and for a free - boundary model .    in the spirit of @xcite",
    ", we will assume that polymerisation occurs more likely at the boundary points where the marker concentration is the lower ( the marker we consider is a rear marker ) .",
    "recalling what was explained previously , the fluid problem writes @xmath86    a more realistic boundary condition on @xmath61 would have been to impose that @xmath87 where @xmath88 denotes the positive part . indeed the case where @xmath61 takes negative values is not realistic from the modelling viewpoint .",
