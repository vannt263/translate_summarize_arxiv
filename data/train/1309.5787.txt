    "given a finite relation @xmath9 between two sets @xmath2 and @xmath3 , a corresponding graph can classically be defined in several ways ; @xmath2 and @xmath3 are often considered either as stable sets or as cliques of a graph , and @xmath9 describes the edges between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "first , when both @xmath2 and @xmath3 are stable sets , @xmath9 defines a _ bipartite graph _",
    "@xmath10 with edges between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the maximal bicliques of this bipartite graph can be organized by inclusion into a lattice , called a _",
    "concept lattice _",
    "@xcite ( or _ galois lattice _",
    "second , when both @xmath2 and @xmath3 are cliques , the corresponding graph is _ co - bipartite_. third , when without loss of generality , @xmath2 is a clique and @xmath3 is a stable set , the corresponding graph is a _",
    "split graph_. finally , @xmath9 defines a _ hypergraph _",
    "where , without loss of generality , @xmath2 is the vertex set and @xmath3 describes the hyperedges .",
    "naturally , there are strong relationships between different realizations of @xmath9 .",
    "one example of this correspondence , which is central to this paper , is the one between chordal bipartite graphs and strongly chordal graphs ( see @xcite and lemma [ lemma : cbgstrchsplit ] of section [ sect : preliminaries ] ) : a bipartite graph @xmath1 is chordal bipartite if and only if the graph obtained from @xmath4 by completing @xmath2 to a clique is strongly chordal .    in this paper , we will also use the complement relation @xmath12 , which we called the _ mirror relation _ @xcite .",
    "the _ mirror _ ( or _ bipartite complement _ ) @xmath0 of a bipartite graph @xmath1 has the same color classes @xmath2 and @xmath3 as @xmath4 , and two vertices @xmath5 and @xmath6 are adjacent in @xmath0 if and only if @xmath7 .",
    "several papers use this mirror notion , with various names and notations .",
    "most of them in fact investigate _auto - mirror_ relations ( _ i.e. _ , both the relation and its mirror relation are in the same class ) .",
    "such relations were used e.g. by @xcite to describe bipartite graphs whose vertex set can be partitioned into a stable set and a maximal biclique ; by @xcite to decompose a bipartite graph in a manner similar to modular decomposition ; by @xcite to investigate the chain dimension of a bipartite graph , remarking the ( obvious ) fact that a bipartite graph is a chain graph ( i.e. , is @xmath13-free ) if and only if its mirror is also a chain graph ; by @xcite and @xcite to characterize split graphs of dilworth number 2 ( the _ dilworth number _ of a graph is the maximum number of its vertices such that the neighborhood of one vertex is not contained in the closed neighborhood of another @xcite ; see section [ sect : dilworth ] ) ; by @xcite to characterize split graphs of dilworth number 3 ; by @xcite to characterize lattices with an articulation point .",
    "recently , @xcite characterized concept lattices which are planar and whose mirror lattice is also planar : this is the case if and only if the corresponding bipartite graph as well as its mirror is chordal bipartite .",
    "we call these graphs _ auto - chordal - bipartite graphs _ ( _ acb graphs _ for short ) ; these are the main topic of this paper . though chordal bipartite graphs have given rise to a wealth of publications , to the best of our knowledge acb graphs",
    "have not been studied .    by lemma [ lemma : cbgstrchsplit ]",
    ", acb graphs correspond to split graphs which are strongly chordal and whose mirror is strongly chordal as well ( _ auto - strongly - chordal _ graphs ) .",
    "one special class of auto - strongly - chordal graphs which is well - known is that of interval graphs whose complement is an interval graph as well ( _ auto - interval graphs _ ) ; this special class of split graphs was characterized by @xcite using results from @xcite as those having dilworth number at most 2 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sections [ sect : preliminaries ] and [ sect : dilworth ] , we give some necessary notations , definitions and previous results . in section [ sect : dilwacb - xy ] , we show that the dilworth number of acb graphs is unbounded .",
    "we address the question of determining both the dilworth number with respect to @xmath2 and to @xmath3 , and show that both numbers can be arbitrarily large and that the gap between the two numbers can also be arbitrarily large .",
    "in section [ sect : dilwacbbounded ] , the main result of this paper is a characterization of acb graphs with dilworth number at most @xmath8 in terms of forbidden induced subgraphs .",
    "finally , in section [ sect : algo ] , we discuss some algorithmic aspects of acb graphs .",
    "throughout this paper , all graphs are finite , simple ( i.e. , without loops and multiple edges ) and undirected . for a graph @xmath14 ,",
    "let @xmath15 denote the complement graph with @xmath16 .",
