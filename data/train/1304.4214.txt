    "a common symptom of correlated - electron systems is magnetism , and neutron scattering is the premiere technique for measuring magnetic correlations in solids . with a spin angular momentum of @xmath3 ,",
    "the neutron interacts directly with the magnetization density of the solid .",
    "elastic scattering can directly reveal static magnetic order ; for example , neutron diffraction provided the first experimental evidence for nel antiferromagnetism @xcite . through inelastic scattering one can probe dynamic spin - spin correlations ; in an ordered antiferromagnet , one can measure the precession of the spins about their average orientations , which show up as dispersing spin waves .",
    "neutrons do not couple to the charge of the electrons , but instead scatter from atomic nuclei via the strong force . despite the name , the small size of the nucleus compared to the electronic charge cloud of the atom results in a rather weak scattering cross section .",
    "the magnetic and nuclear scattering cross sections are comparable , so that neutron scattering is very sensitive to magnetism , in a relative sense .",
    "a challenge with neutron scattering is that the combination of weak scattering cross section and limited source strength means that one needs a relatively large sample size compared with many other techniques .",
    "the value of the information that can be obtained by neutron scattering generally makes worthwhile the effort to grow large samples ; nevertheless , in practice it is useful to take advantage of complementary information obtained from techniques such as muon spin rotation spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance .",
    "the latter techniques yield less information but often provide greater precision .",
    "there have also been continuing developments in resonant x - ray scattering ; nevertheless , neutron scattering will remain an essential technique to investigate strongly correlated systems for the foreseeable future .",
    "as we have space only for a concise introduction to the field , we note that there plenty of more extended references available . a good summary of the theory of neutron scattering is given by squires @xcite , while a more detailed description is provided by lovesey @xcite .",
    "we have contributed to a technique - oriented book @xcite and to book chapters on magnetic neutron scattering @xcite , and new books on the subject continue to appear .",
    "to illustrate some of the concepts and capabilities , we will use examples involving copper - oxide compounds , especially from the family la@xmath0ba@xmath1cuo@xmath2 , which includes phenomena from antiferromagnetic order to high - temperature superconductivity .",

    "neutrons are especially abundant in nuclei of high atomic number , where they can significantly exceed the number of protons . to create a neutron beam ,",
    "the first challenge is to extract neutrons from the nuclei .",
    "the first practical source was the nuclear reactor , in which neutron bombardment of @xmath12u nuclei induces fission , a process that releases several neutrons per incident neutron , thus allowing for a self - sustaining chain reaction .",
    "the neutrons that are released have a very large energy , whereas the fission cross section is enhanced by slower neutrons .",
    "the slowing of neutrons can be achieved quite effectively by scattering from hydrogen , especially in the form of h@xmath13o , which can also act to cool the reactor core . in a research reactor , where one would like to extract some of the neutrons",
    ", the reactor moderator can be made more transparent to neutrons by replacing h@xmath13o with d@xmath13o ( heavy water , with d representing deuterium ) .",
    "cylindrical thimbles poking into the water moderator provide an escape path for neutrons , which form the beams that supply neutron spectrometers .",
    "another approach is to knock the neutrons out of heavy nuclei with high - energy protons from an accelerator .",
    "again , the neutrons that can escape the nuclei have very high energies that must be reduced by multiple scattering in a moderator .",
    "in contrast to a reactor , which produces neutron beams that are continuous in time , the proton beam provided by an accelerator can be pulsed , so that a spallation source typically has pulsed beams of neutrons .",
    "targets can be made of a heavy metal such as tungsten , but newer sources with higher power tend to use liquid mercury in order to allow adequate heat removal .    a list of the major operating spallation sources in the world is given in the upper portion of table  [ tranq : tb : source ] .",
    "information on the available instrumentation and capabilities can be obtained from the listed web sites . with a pulsed neutron source ,",
    "each burst of neutrons is produced in a narrow time window , so that one can distinguish between neutrons of different velocities by their travel time , or `` time of flight '' . using a rotating shutter ,",
    "one can select incident neutrons of a desired energy ; the energy of scattered neutrons can then be determined by their time of arrival at a detector .",
