    "searching and investigating models in which one might observe a supersolid phase ( ss ) has been one of the central research interests in condensed matter physics recently . indeed , it is reported numerically that several spin models and extended bose - hubbard models provide convincing evidence for the existence of a supersolid state , where the long range superfluid order and solid order coexist @xcite .",
    "for example , a monte carlo investigation of bilayer spin-1/2 heisenberg model with an external uniform magnetic field on the square lattice demonstrates that a field - induced supersolid phase can be stabilized when the magnitude of the external magnetic field takes certain values @xcite .",
    "a supersolid phase is observed numerically by considering interacting bosons as well @xcite .",
    "further , it is expected that ss and the quantum phase transitions out of ss might be realized experimentally using ultracold atoms on optical lattices @xcite .",
    "although rich phase diagrams have been obtained for both spin models and extended bose - hubbard models , a detailed investigation of the nature of the phase transitions out of ss is available only for bilayer spin-1/2 heisenberg model on the square lattice .",
    "further , despite the fact that the bilayer spin-1/2 heisenberg model can be mapped into the hard - core bose - hubbard model , it is known that both the hard - core bose - hubbard model on the square and the honeycomb lattices do not exhibit a stable ss phase in the @xmath16-@xmath17 phase diagram at a fixed @xmath18 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath19 is the nearest - neighbor hopping parameter , @xmath20 is the chemical potential , @xmath21 is a nearest - neighbor repulsion , and @xmath22 stands for an onsite repulsion . as a consequence , it will be interesting to carry out an investigation on the nature of quantum phase transitions out of ss for the extended bose - hubbard model . finally , considering the many noticeable properties of graphene @xcite , for which the underlying lattice is a honeycomb lattice , as well as the fact that quantum fluctuations are expected to be more relevant on the honeycomb lattice due to its coordination number , in this paper we study the phase transition from a ss phase to a solid state of @xmath23 for the extended bose - hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice using first principles monte carlo simulations . here",
    "@xmath24 refers to the average number of bosons per lattice site .",
    "the nature of quantum phase transitions out of a ss to a superfluid and a solid phases have been studied quantitatively using first principles unbiased quantum monte carlo method for the bilayer spin-1/2 heisenberg model @xcite .",
    "indeed it is demonstrated convincingly that the critical theories determined from the monte carlo data are consistent with the theoretical prediction @xcite .",
    "for example , by applying the technique of data collapse to the observable superfluid density @xmath25 , one reaches a perfect agreement between the numerical data and the theoretical prediction of superfluid - insulator universality class for the phase transition from a ss to a solid state @xcite . to obtain the ground - state phase diagrams of the desired models using finite temperature monte carlo algorithms , in particular to quantitatively study the nature of the phase transitions in the phase diagrams ,",
    "one useful strategy is to scale the inverse temperature @xmath7 by the relation @xmath26 in the simulations . here in addition to the dynamical critical exponent @xmath1 which is already introduced earlier , @xmath27 and @xmath28 appearing in @xmath29",
    "are the box sizes used in the simulations and a constant , respectively .",
    "surprisingly , despite the fact that the correct way to determine the critical theory for a second order phase transition is to employ the relation @xmath30 in the simulations , several studies seem to simply use @xmath31 and ignore the impact of the dynamical critical exponent @xmath1 when obtaining the ground - state phase diagrams . whether the strategy of using @xmath31 instead of @xmath29 in the monte carlo calculations has noticeable influence on determining the critical theory for a second order phase transition",
    "remains to explore .",
    "the motivation of our investigation on the quantum phase transition from a supersolid state to a solid state of @xmath0 by varying @xmath17 at fixed @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the parameter space for the extended bose - hubbard model is twofold .",
    "first of all , we would like to determine the critical chemical potential @xmath10 as precise as possible since such a study is useful in calculating critical exponents such as @xmath7 ( @xmath34 ) and @xmath35 . secondly ,",
    "since one should scale the inverse temperature @xmath7 with the system size for the phase transition considered here due to the theoretical prediction @xmath36 , we would like to understand the impact of scaling @xmath7 linearly with the linear length of the system on studying the corresponding critical theory of this transition . indeed as we will demonstrate later , scaling @xmath7 linearly with the system linear length either leads to poor data collapse for the observables measured in this study , or one would arrive at a different critical theory than the expected one .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . after a brief description of the motivation behind this study ,",
    "the extended bose - hubbard model considered here as well as the observables measured in our monte carlo simulations are introduced .",
    "follows that we present our numerical results .",
    "in particular , the corresponding critical point is determined with high precision by the method of data collapse .",
    "the subtlety of determining the critical theory for the transition from a ss phase to a solid state of @xmath0 is demonstrated as well .",
    "finally , a section is devoted to conclude our investigation .",
    "the extended bose - hubbard model considered in this study is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) are the bosonic creation ( annihilation ) operators at site @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the occupation number at lattice site @xmath40 .",
    "further , @xmath22 , @xmath21 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 appearing in eq .",

    "the honeycomb lattice with periodic spatial boundary conditions implemented in our simulations is depicted in figure 1 .",
    "the dashed rectangle in figure 1 , which contains @xmath42 spins , is the elementary cell for building a periodic honeycomb lattice covering a rectangular area .",
    "for instance , the honeycomb lattice shown in figure 1 contains 3 @xmath43 3 elementary cells .",
    "the lattice spacing @xmath44 is the distance between two neighboring sites .",
    "the honeycomb lattice is not a bravais lattice .",
    "instead it consists of two triangular bravais sub - lattices @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( depicted by solid and open circles in figure 1 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the momentum space of the honeycomb lattice is a doubly - covered brillouin zone of the two triangular sub - lattices .    following earlier works in @xcite , our primary interest for the model described by eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) is to study the phase transitions from a supersolid phase to a solid phase of @xmath0 and from a superfluid phase to a mott insulator phase of @xmath47 by varying the chemical potential @xmath17 at fixed @xmath32 and @xmath48 in the parameter space .",
    "in particular we would like to determine the critical chemical potentials @xmath10 as well as the correlation length critical exponents @xmath2 and dynamical critical exponents @xmath1 for these two phase transitions accurately . to fulfill these tasks , we have measured the superfluid density @xmath49 with @xmath50 in our simulations and have focused on the finite - size scaling of @xmath51 . here",

    "0.75 cm    0.25 cm    -0.1 cm    0.5 cm",
    "to determine the location of the critical point in the parameter space @xmath17 , one useful technique is to study the finite - size scaling of certain observables .",
    "for example , if the transition is second order , then near the transition , the observable @xmath53 for @xmath54 should be described well by the following finite - size scaling ansatz @xmath55 where @xmath56 stands for @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath2 is the critical exponent corresponding to the correlation length @xmath59 .",
    "finally @xmath60 appearing above is a smooth function of the variables @xmath61 and @xmath62 . in writing eq .",
    "( [ fss ] ) , we have ignored explicitly the confluent correction to the scaling . taking this correction into account ,",
    "one concludes that for large enough @xmath7 when the finite - temperature effects can be ignored , the curves of different @xmath63 for @xmath56 , as functions of @xmath17 , should have the tendency to intersect at critical point @xmath10 for large @xmath63 .",
    "theoretically , it is predicted that the transition from a supersolid phase to a solid phase of @xmath0 for this model is governed by the superfluid - insulator universality class , namely one has @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath36 @xcite . in the following",

    "we have fixed @xmath21 to be @xmath69 and have varied @xmath20 . to determine @xmath10 using the finite - size scaling ansatz eq .",
    "( [ fss ] ) , one needs to use large enough @xmath7 so that the finite - temperature effects are negligible . for this purpose ,",
