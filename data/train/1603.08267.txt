    "quantum revivals , when after some finite time @xmath13 the initial state is wholly or partially recovered , are generally a property of simple systems with only a few degrees of freedom .",
    "the simplest example is the harmonic oscillator , where , since the energy gaps are quantized in integer multiples of @xmath14 , the return amplitude @xmath15 is exactly unity at times @xmath16 integer .",
    "more generally , such full or partial revivals at which @xmath17 should occur only if the ratios of energy gaps happen to be rational numbers with a finite common denominator , or if the initial state happens to couple to only such energy eigenstates . in more complex quantum systems such coincidences are rare , and",
    "one expects to see no revivals at which @xmath4 is @xmath18 .",
    "indeed , the overlap should in general vanish roughly as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the dimension of the hilbert space . for a system with an extensively large number of degrees of freedom ,",
    "this implies an exponential vanishing of @xmath4 with the volume .",
    "even for such extensive systems , however , there are exceptions for which quantum revivals may occur .",
    "this can happen if there is a spectrum - generating algebra with ladder operators analogous to those in the harmonic oscillator , for example the virasoro ( or extended ) algebras in rational cfts on a circle for @xmath12 , or for massless free scalar field theory on the torus or sphere in higher dimensions . in a previous paper @xcite the @xmath12 case",
    "was investigated for the case when the initial state has short - range correlations and area - law entanglement .",
    "this scenario is often called a quantum quench , because the initial state approximates the ground state of a pre - quench gapped hamiltonian , while the dynamics proceeds according to the gapless hamiltonian of a cft .",
    "it was found there that , for a rational cft , quantum revivals at which @xmath17 generally occur at times such that @xmath21 integer , where @xmath22 is the circumference of the circle , although full revivals occur only at certain multiples of this .",
    "moreover it was shown that , for a particular initial state of the form @xmath23 is a conformal boundary state , @xmath24 may be expressed in terms of the partition function on an annulus , continued to complex values of the modulus .",
    "this may be written as a linear combination of virasoro characters which are functions of @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the effective inverse temperature of the initial state .",
    "the fact that these transform simply under the modular group generated by @xmath27 and @xmath28 implies that there are not only revivals at integer values of @xmath29 , but echoes of these near all rational values of this ratio .",

    "this follows from a well - controlled analytic continuation of the casimir contribution to the free energy of a strip of width @xmath32 and length @xmath33 .",

    "this is of course consistent with the ads / cft interpretation that in the quench scenario an in - falling initial energy / mass density will result in the formation of a black hole and purely thermal behavior ( although the detailed dynamics of this process may be more complicated ) .",

    "[ sec3 ] we consider the simplest cft of all , a massless scalar field theory , in the case where @xmath41 has the most symmetry , _ i.e. _ is a sphere @xmath9 of circumference @xmath22 ( i.e. radius @xmath42 when embedded in @xmath43 ) .",

    "for a free field theory this is straightforward to compute by enumerating all operators all of which have canonical integer ( or half - integer ) dimensions .",
    "this last fact immediately implies the existence of complete quantum revivals at integer values of @xmath29 ( or @xmath11 ) . _ _",

    "there will be an image , or echo , of the initial oscillating decay .",
    "on the other hand we find that for @xmath34 odd there is destructive interference at half - integer @xmath29 , and echoes of these negative peaks then also appear at other rational values . as we shall see , these negative peaks are in fact related to the behavior of a fermionic partition function .",
    "we consider a cft on a @xmath57-dimensional compact spatial manifold @xmath41 of characteristic size @xmath22 , evolving from an initial state @xmath3 at time @xmath58 .",
    "this state is taken to have short - range correlations such as would occur in the non - degenerate ground state of a massive quantum field theory .",
    "another way of stating this is to require that the mutual information between two widely separated regions should decay exponentially over distances smaller than @xmath22 .    in 2d , in @xcite",
    "a choice was made for such a state of the form given in eq .",
    "[ ccstate ] , where @xmath44 is a conformally invariant boundary state .",
    "this was motivated partly by renormalization group considerations that all boundary states should be equivalent to a conformal state on large distance scales , but more practically for reasons of analytic tractability . however , as was argued in @xcite , and shown more completely in @xcite , in 2d the state ( [ ccstate ] ) has the property that it _ thermalizes _ _ , that is , although the whole system remains in a pure state , the reduced density matrix of any subsystem becomes exponentially close to the reduced density matrix of a thermal gibbs ensemble @xmath59 after a finite time ( essentially the time it takes for a light signal to cross the subsystem ) . since",
    "generic systems are usually assumed to thermalize , this is therefore a useful idealized model for how this happens in a solvable model .",
    "_ _ _    however , another way to view the state in ( [ ccstate ] ) is to recognize that @xmath60 is the space integral of one of the leading irrelevant operators which may act on @xmath44 .",
    "this suggests that a more general initial state may be constructed by adding to the exponent in ( [ ccstate ] ) all possible other irrelevant operators . for a 2d cft",
    "this was argued in @xcite to lead to a generalized gibbs ensemble ( gge ) , which takes into account all the local conservation laws of the cft ( essentially integrals of local holomorphic and anti - holomorphic currents . ) in general it is has been argued that in such integrable models the stationary state should be described by a gge @xcite , and exactly which conservation laws should be included has been the subject of considerable investigation @xcite .",
    "however , for @xmath40 we expect most cfts to be non - integrable and therefore to thermalize to a gibbs ensemble after a quench from any reasonable state . for this reason we may consider the analog of ( [ ccstate ] ) as an initial state , where @xmath44 is now a boundary state on @xmath41 , defined by @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is a coordinate labeling @xmath41 .",
    "we assume throughout that the volume of @xmath41 is @xmath63 with @xmath64 .",

    "one also expects this as a consequence of the hawking radiation after formation of a black hole @xcite in ads@xmath65 .",
    "however for 2d cfts and free field theory in @xmath40 the thermalization argument technically relies on a use of the method of images and analyticity arguments which do not obviously apply to a general @xmath40 cft .",

    "@xmath73 is a universal constant depending on the cft and the boundary condition @xmath69 .",
    "note that for a curved manifold @xmath41 we expect also curvature dependent terms in @xmath74 .",
    "these should be proportional to the integrated curvature and so down by a relative factor of @xmath75 compared with the leading term .    for a 2d cft , and for a free theory for @xmath40 with dirichlet boundary conditions , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is ( minus ) the free energy at finite temperature @xmath78 .",
    "@xmath79 is proportional to the stefan - boltzmann constant of the cft and determines the asymptotic behavior of the density of states . for these cases @xmath80 is equal to the mean energy @xmath81 of the cft at temperature @xmath82 .",
    "this relation between @xmath73 and @xmath79 is a consequence of the method of images being applicable to correlators of the stress tensor , for all 2d cfts and for free theories in @xmath40 .",
    "however there seems to be no reason for it to hold more generally for @xmath40 ( although they should still be proportional ) , and in this case we take @xmath26 to be simply a length scale parametrizing the initial state @xmath3 .",
    "let us now consider the return amplitude [ ret ] f(t)=|b|e^-(/4)he^-ithe^-(/4)h|b .",

    "( note that in principle there are also uv - divergent terms in @xmath74 proportional to the @xmath34-dimensional space - time volume and also the @xmath34-dimensional volume of @xmath41 .",

    "indeed we have @xmath87 thus in these two cases the height above the plateau value changes sign at values of @xmath88 and , unlike the case @xmath12 , the asymptotic value is reached from below .",

    "we now discuss the domain of applicability of these results .",
    "this may be ascertained by estimating the corrections to the casimir term in the free energy .",
    "if @xmath41 has sufficient symmetry ( for example , itself contains an @xmath55 factor ) we may quantize along this direction so that ` space ' has dimensions @xmath90 and imaginary ` time ' dimension @xmath2 . in this picture ,",

    "this accounts for the leading casimir term in ( [ casimir ] ) .",
    "the corrections to this , however , should come in this picture from excited states which should have a finite - size gap dependence @xmath94 .",
    "thus the corrections to the partition function should have the form @xmath95)=e^{\\tilde\\sigma{\\rm vol}(m)/(\\beta/2)^{d-1}}\\left(1+o\\big(e^{-{\\rm const.}l/\\beta}\\big)\\right)\\,,\\ ] ] just as for @xmath12 @xcite . in the next section we find this to be the case for a free field theory on @xmath9 , as a consequence of modular symmetry , the only difference being a power - law pre - factor .",
    "this may be understood in terms of the excited states forming a continuum as a result of the additional large @xmath91 dimensions .",
    "assuming this to be the case in general , we can now assert that for @xmath96 the casimir term dominates as long as @xmath97 , which translates into @xmath98 , just as in 2d @xcite . note that this time scale is greater than the width @xmath99 of the initial gaussian and any transient oscillations .",
    "thus the plateau behavior should always be observable as long as @xmath64 .",
    "however the plateau behavior may persist longer than this in holographic theories .",

    "if both @xmath3 and @xmath128 are taken to be random states in an energy range around the saddle - point value , we would expect @xmath129 while this works in 2d , for @xmath40 the overlap is much larger than expected on the basis of this simple argument .",
