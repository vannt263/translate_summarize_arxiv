    "<S> we demonstrate the generation of artificial gauge potentials for neutral atoms in an optical lattice without any requirements on the specific internal structure . </S>",
    "<S> as the realized scheme only relies on the trapability of the particle , it can be very widely applied to many atomic systems , in principle also to molecules and other complex particles . </S>",
    "<S> it is particularly interesting for fermionic systems , where in a many - body state governed by pauli principle , the use of internal degrees of freedom often lead to conflicts with the creation of gauge potentials . as an important additional benefit , </S>",

    "<S> we have chosen an intermediate value @xmath47 for the experiment realized here . </S>",

    "<S> the thereby introduced gauge potential @xmath48 manifests itself via a shift of the dispersion relation by @xmath30 as depicted in fig . </S>",

    "<S> in addition , the experimental images demonstrate the large degree of coherence maintained in the atomic sample throughout the shaking process . as an additional feature , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) shows that the peierls phase allows now to invert the sign of the effective tunneling element without crossing @xmath53=0 via the rotation in the complex plane . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we will discuss the details of the relaxation of the system towards non - zero quasi - momenta superfluid states , allowing for the described direct measurement of the peierls phase . </S>",
    "<S> note that for an homogeneous and non - interacting system , the initial bloch wave at @xmath54=0 remains an eigenstate of the effective hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> thus no transfer to states with @xmath55@xmath560 is expected after the shaking is turned on . </S>",

    "<S> time - resolved measurements . </S>",
    "<S> * ( a),(b ) * a quench to a peierls phase of -@xmath4/4 within 1ms induces an excitation of the dipole mode , leading to oscillations of the quasimomentum as depicted in * ( a ) * and observed in the time - resolved measurement of the quasi - momentum up to 0.5s.*(b)*. the plain curve is a fit to a sinusoid from which one obtains @xmath57=3.6@xmath580.4hz , in perfect agreement with the expected dipole frequency of the dressed condensate . the final value of the peierls phase is depicted as a dashed line . * ( c)-(f ) * shift of the quasi - momentum towards a final peierls phase of 3@xmath4/2 for a slow increase of the forcing amplitude over 160ms * ( c),(d ) * or a sudden quench within 1ms * ( e),(f)*. the left graphs depict the center of mass dynamics in @xmath55-space in both cases . on the right , series of time - of - flight images are reported as a function of time . </S>",
    "<S> the time - steps are 10ms and 1ms , respectively.,width=321 ]    when the gauge potential is ramped up from 0 to @xmath59 , the condensate acquires a non - zero group velocity , reflecting the presence of an artificial electric force @xmath60=-@xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> this velocity induces a displacement of the condensate s center of mass position @xmath62 in the harmonic potential of frequency @xmath63 ( see appendix ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting restoring force induces oscillations both in position and momentum - space ( see fig . [ fig3](a ) ) . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](b ) , we report a time - resolved measurement of the condensate quasi - momentum after a quench to a final peierls phase of -@xmath4/4 . the oscillations around the final quasi - momentum result from an excitation of the dipole mode : the measured frequency of 3.6@xmath580.4hz perfectly matches the expected dressed condensate frequency @xmath64 for particles having an effective mass @xmath65 in the lattice of 10@xmath581@xmath66 depth with a tunneling amplitude of 0.3 @xmath67 ( @xmath68=3.5@xmath580.5hz ) . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling to non - zero quasi - momenta results thus from the underlying harmonic trapping potential . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , this center of mass dynamics is subjected to several damping mechanisms induced by the trap anharmonicity or the lattice discreteness , which leads to a coupling to other collective modes and therefore to the relaxation of the bec towards the new equilibrium state . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the duration of the ramp from 0 to @xmath59 has to be compared with the timescale of those relaxation mechanisms . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] we compare time - resolved measurements of the quasi - momentum distribution for a slow ramp ( fig . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig3](f ) ) . as the gauge field </S>",
    "<S> is slowly increased , the bec follows the shift of the dispersion relation minimum , as depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](c ) . for the quench , on the contrary , for which the shift of the dispersion relation occurs within one ms , </S>",
    "<S> the system can not follow and thus relaxes into the nearest minimum of the effective band structure ( see fig [ fig3](e ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the chosen value this minimum lies on the left with respect to the original @xmath55=0 peaks and we thus find the bec at @xmath55=-@xmath4/2@xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates clearly that in presence of these relaxation mechanisms , the forcing does not induce a net particle current in the lattice unlike for ratchets but allows the engineering of ground - state superfluids at arbitrary non - zero quasi - momenta . </S>",
    "<S> our scheme to generate complex tunneling offers fascinating possibilities to emulate gauge fields in higher dimensions . in the following , few examples based on lattice shaking and modulated superlattices will be described . </S>",

    "<S> homogeneous forcing , implemented by lattice shaking , can not give rise to a magnetic flux through plaquettes having pairwise parallel edges like square or hexagonal . </S>",
    "<S> it can , however , lead to a non - zero flux @xmath72 through a triangular plaquette ; @xmath73 for @xmath74 the amplitude of the force oriented parallel to one edge . as depicted in fig . </S>",

    "<S> * ( a ) * staggered magnetic fluxes obtained in a 2d triangular lattice . * ( b ) * dispersion relation for different values of the magnetic flux @xmath76 through a plaquette.,width=321 ]    our method enables one to continuously control the degree of frustration from zero ( @xmath77 ) to maximum ( @xmath78 ) in lattice geometries like triangular or kagom @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this control can be used to adiabatically prepare and study exotic quantum phases that are expected to appear in the strongly frustrated limit . </S>",
    "<S> increasing the flux in a triangular lattice , frustration is reflected in the fact that the dispersion relation develops two minima that eventually , for @xmath4-flux , become degenerate ( see fig . [ fig4](b ) ) . in a triangular lattice with @xmath4-flux spontaneous symmetry - breaking </S>",
    "<S> has recently been observed in an experimental simulation of classical magnetism @xcite . with the presented scheme , </S>",
    "<S> one is now able to study the influence of a small symmetry - breaking perturbation and to observe the many - body dynamics initiated by preparing a system in the upper minimum . </S>",
    "<S> tunable magnetic fluxes through e.g. square or hexagonal plaquettes can also be obtained via inhomogeneous forcing . </S>",
    "<S> a simple way of doing this , is to create an oscillating super - lattice as will be described elsewhere . beyond the engineering of the hopping element , </S>",
    "<S> another essential feature of our scheme is the possibility to address the atomic internal degrees of freedom independently . here </S>",
