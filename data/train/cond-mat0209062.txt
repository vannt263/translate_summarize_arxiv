    "since the discovery of high temperature superconductors , a renewed interest has increased in models describing strongly correlated electrons . as the simplest one the hubbard model has been intensively studied within the analysis of strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "apart from it , various generalized hubbard models have also attracted considerable interest.@xcite indeed , by including some additional interaction terms into the hubbard hamiltonian , either the magnetic ordering phases or the superconducting phases may be stabilized in appropriate regions of the parameter space.@xcite the introduction in these models of orbital degrees of freedom@xcite enriches the phase diagram of the model , because the interplay of orbital and spin dynamics can yield a series of novel physical phenomena , such as unconventional metal - insulator transition , novel quantum spin and orbital ordered states , and transport property anomalies.@xcite    generally , all of these models retain only part of the electron - electron interactions which arise as a result of the repulsion between two electrons having opposite spins and located at the same lattice site . in spite of this crude assumption , these models correspond to a many - body problem and in general can not be exactly solved .",
    "exact solutions are of great importance , since in some cases the errors introduced by the approximations may dominate the results to such an extent that one might end up with an incorrect description of the phenomenon under study . considering the exact results with respect to the dimensionality of the model , we know that most of them have been derived in two limiting case : either in one dimension or in the infinity dimensions .",
    "for instance , the exact solution of the hubbard model was given in the one dimensional case by means of the bethe ansatz by lieb and wu@xcite .",
    "the other class of exact solutions belongs to the other limiting case , i.e. d=@xmath1 , where the dynamical mean - field approximation becomes exact.@xcite the situation gets more complicated as physically interesting lower dimensional cases are considered .",
    "d@xmath21 rules out the applicability of the well - established bethe ansatz approach , while mean - field - like descriptions lead to qualitatively or quantitatively incorrect conclusions , because the effects of spatial and dynamical fluctuations are not properly taken into account . nevertheless , exact results holding in any dimensions are available .",
    "we refer to , for instance , the lieb theorem@xcite , the flat - band ferromagnetism@xcite , and the nagaoka theorem.@xcite however , for extended versions of the hubbard model exact results are still rare.@xcite,@xcite    in this paper we rigorously prove some exact results for a generalized hubbard model .",
    "namely , we consider a two - orbital hubbard hamiltonian which incorporates also the hund s rule coupling .",
    "we notice that the study of relevant physical systems requires the use of such kind of model whose minimal constituents are the hopping term between different , or same , orbitals , and the on - site coulomb and exchange interactions .",
    "this is for instance , to report few of them , the case of non - metallic cu@xmath3compounds@xcite ( d@xmath4 configuration , one hole in the two degenerate @xmath5-orbitals ) , low spin ni@xmath6@xcite(d@xmath7 configuration , one electron in @xmath5-orbitals ) , as well as mn@xmath6 and cr@xmath3@xcite ions ( high - spin d@xmath8 configuration , one @xmath5 electron ) , and in the ru@xmath9 ions@xcite ( d@xmath8 configuration , two holes in @xmath10 -orbitals ) .    here",
    ", our aim is to determine rigorously the symmetry properties of the above mentioned hubbard hamiltonian by investigating which values of the spin , orbital and @xmath0 pairing pseudospin quantum numbers occur in the ground state . a physical interpretation and discussion of the outcome",
    "is also presented .",
    "the following conditions are assumed for the validity of the results obtained below : i ) the number of electrons is equal to twice number of sites in the lattice ; ii ) the lattice satisfies the connectivity condition ; iii ) the hopping amplitude is different from zero only for charge transfer between orbitals of the same type . + the scheme of the proof develops into three preliminary steps which are based on the use of the property of reflection positivity of the hamiltonian in an opportune range of parameters and on the application of continuity arguments derived by the uniqueness of the ground state .",
    "furthermore , the link introduced by some unitary transformations between the ground states in different regions of the space of parameters , allows to recover all the missing information about their symmetry properties .",
    "the explicit form of the hamiltonian for a double orbitally degenerate hubbard model on a connected bipartite lattice @xmath11 is written as : @xmath12 where @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15    here @xmath16 is the creation operator of correlated electrons with spin @xmath17 at site @xmath18 on orbital @xmath19 ( = 1,2 ) , respectively and @xmath20 is the number operator for the electrons on the i site and @xmath21 orbital .",
    "moreover , we have used the simplified notation @xmath22 .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 is the hopping matrix between nearest - neighbor sites , and we assume that the @xmath21 orbitals are not mixed by the hopping ; @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 stand for the intra - orbital , inter - orbital coulomb and hund s rule exchange interaction , respectively .",
    "the results presented below are valid for any choice of the parameters in the hamiltonian .",
    "nevertheless , since the two orbitals are equivalent and can be interchanged by a properly chosen canonical transformation , we impose an additional condition on the set of the parameters , that is @xmath27.@xcite hereafter , we will use this relation together with the condition that @xmath25 and @xmath26 are positive .",
    "when will be needed , the sign of the coulomb and hund coupling will appear explicitly .",
    "hence @xmath28 becomes , @xmath29 @xmath30 let us introduce the following operators : @xmath31    where @xmath32 are the pauli matrices and @xmath33 depending to which of the two subparts of the bipartite lattice the site @xmath18 belongs .",
    "here @xmath34 is the usual total spin operator , @xmath35 is the pseudospin operator and @xmath36 is the so called pairing operator introduced by yang @xcite , extended to the case of two types of electrons .",
    "the @xmath37 operator has properties that are exactly analogous to the properties of the usual one - half spin operator .",
    "indeed , its third component at each site assumes the values @xmath38 and @xmath39 corresponding to the occupied orbitals @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "besides , @xmath42 takes a fermion in the orbital 2 , at the lattice site i , and transports it to the orbital 1 located at the same lattice point .",
    "obviously , @xmath43 corresponds to the opposite process . + as for @xmath34 and @xmath37 , the @xmath36 operators generate another @xmath44 algebra which has as base configurations those with one orbital doubly occupied or empty on each site .    in this model ,",
    "the total spin operator @xmath34 commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath45 = 0 $ ] and is a good quantum number .",
    "another symmetry is that one related to the orbital degree of freedom as defined by @xmath37 .",
    "the square of the total orbital pseudospin operator @xmath37 and its third component @xmath46 commute with the hamiltonian @xmath47 , since there is no hopping between different orbitals in @xmath48 . on the other hand , the square of the total @xmath0 pseudospin operator and its third component @xmath49 also commute with the hamiltonian .",
    "hence , these relations imply that these are conserved quantities and that the eigenstates of @xmath47 can be labelled as follows :    @xmath50    we also notice that @xmath51 and @xmath52 commutes with @xmath47 , namely the @xmath53 multiplets are degenerate in energy .",
    "this property is not valid for the @xmath54 and @xmath55 operators .",
    "it is important pointing out that these algebras are not independent each - other and can be related by means of extended hole - particle and orbital type transformations .",
    "let us consider the following unitary transformation @xmath56 : @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 under this transformation one has @xmath61 and the hamiltonian h is transformed as follows : @xmath62 here @xmath63 i.e. @xmath64 can be obtained from @xmath47 replacing @xmath26 with @xmath65 , implying that @xmath66 and @xmath47 are related to each other .",
    "there is also another transformation that will appear very useful later for the determination of the symmetry properties of the ground state .",
    "this is the hole - particle transformation of the base operators of creation and annihilation : @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70    under this transformation one has @xmath71 and the hamiltonian @xmath47 is transformed as follows : @xmath72 here @xmath73 i.e. @xmath74 can be obtained from @xmath47 replacing @xmath26 with @xmath65 and @xmath25 with @xmath75 , implying that @xmath76 and @xmath47 are related to each other .",
    "our purpose is to determine rigorously the symmetry properties of the two - band hubbard model as defined above , by investigating which values of the spin , orbital and @xmath0 pairing pseudospin quantum numbers occur in the ground state .",
    "+ as we have pointed out in the introduction , the proof is based on three preliminary steps , followed by the application of the @xmath77 and @xmath56 transformations to connect the ground states in different regions of the space of parameters .",
    "we will describe how this scheme may allow to get rigorous information on the symmetry property of the ground state even where the of spin reflection positivity is not directly applicable , thus yielding a more general description of the ground state symmetry properties .",
    "+ * step i * : + let consider firstly the case derived by applying the transformation @xmath78 and @xmath79 on @xmath80 which changes @xmath81 .",
    "we remind that this transformation is realized by the application of the unitary transformation @xmath82 on @xmath80 . having this modified hamiltonian the property of spin reflection positivity , it is possible to state@xcite that the ground state @xmath83 of @xmath84 , for any positive value of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , is unique and has total spin @xmath85 .",
    "+ moreover , for this case it is possible to determine the value of the orbital pseudospin quantum number , by looking at the relevant configurations which contribute to the ground state at values of @xmath86 . as @xmath75 is large and negative , one ends up with states which contain only configurations with two electrons occupying the same orbital on one site .",
    "the total orbital pseudospin for this kind of situation is @xmath87 , since it is identically zero on any configuration with two electrons in the same orbital state , i.e. it is a singlet in the orbital space .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the previous statement can be generalized only at the condition that the ground state is non - degenerate .",
    "this property permits the use of continuity like arguments to extend the validity of the result from the extreme large negative limit to any finite value of @xmath75 .",
    "+ * step ii : * + let now analyze the parameter case relative to the hamiltonian @xmath80 which is the most relevant for systems of physical interest .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the ground state of @xmath80 is unique as it is directly connected to that one of @xmath84 by the application of the unitary transformation @xmath82 defined in eqs.14 - 19 .",
    "+ moreover , by performing a perturbation up to second order in @xmath88 , it is possible to show that the low energy processes of @xmath80 are described by an effective heisenberg model for spin one half on an array composed by two sublattices @xmath89 and @xmath90 defined depending on the sign of the magnetic exchange between the spin belonging to the two sublattices .",
    "the effective hamiltonian reads as follows : @xmath91 where @xmath92 , i.e. the direct hund coupling and @xmath93 . for this hamiltonian ,",
    "it has been proved @xcite that the ground state is unique , apart from the usual @xmath44 degeneracy , and it has total spin @xmath94 , where @xmath95 are the total number of lattice sites belonging to the sublattice @xmath95 , respectively . for building the mapping",
    ", one has to consider an array where each orbital @xmath96 on the generic @xmath97 site is associated with an effective one , so that @xmath98 is equal to @xmath99 , @xmath100 being the number of @xmath96 orbitals belonging to the sublattice @xmath101 .",
    "+ it is important to stress that it is again the uniqueness property of the ground state of @xmath102 and @xmath80 that can permit the use of continuity arguments to state that the ground state @xmath103 of @xmath80 is nondegenerate except for the @xmath44 symmetry , and it has total spin @xmath94 .",
    "+ * step iii : * + finally , let analyze the situation obtained by applying to the hamiltonian @xmath80 the transformation @xmath82 which changes @xmath104 . by means of this transformation , @xmath80 is modified in @xmath105 where the hund coupling assumes the form of antiferromagnetic instead than ferromagnetic type interaction . + as it has been performed in the step ii , by means of an expansion up to the second order in @xmath88 , the search of the symmetry properties of the ground state of @xmath105 may be carried into the analysis of the ground state for an effective heisenberg model with two kinds of exchanges .",
    "+ the hamiltonian for the lower energy processes is given by the following expression , @xmath106 where @xmath92 , i.e. the direct hund coupling with inverted sign and @xmath107 .",
    "as for the previous case , by using the arguments of lieb@xcite , one can show that the ground state is unique except for the @xmath44 degeneracy and has total spin @xmath94 .",
    "following the same procedure of step i , one can state by means of continuity arguments that the ground state @xmath108 of @xmath105 is unique and has total spin @xmath94 .",
    "let remind that the value of @xmath95 is related to the number of orbitals belonging to the sublattice @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "+    = 7.5 cm    as a summary in fig .",
    "[ fig : schema ] it has been reported the main findings out of the procedure performed above .",
    "each box contains the information about the quantum numbers of the ground state and to which region of the parameter space it refers .",
    "the ket @xmath109 stands for the ground state , whose @xmath110,@xmath111 , and @xmath0 are the values of the total spin , orbital and @xmath0 pairing pseudospin quantum numbers with @xmath112 given by @xmath98 .",
    "+ as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : schema ] , there are some quantum numbers which can not be derived from the analysis presented in step @xmath113 , and for this reason the missing values have been indicated with a question mark . at this point , it is crucial the use of the transformations @xmath114 and @xmath82 to link the different ground states and the correspondent quantum numbers . indeed , taking advantage of these symmetry transformations , one can complete and extend the scenario as in fig .",
    "[ fig : schema ] by building up the scheme as it is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : schema1 ] .",
    "+ to figure out how to determine the missing information on the ground state , let remind that if we have a simultaneous eigenstate of the operator @xmath34 and of @xmath80 with assigned spin eigenvalue given by @xmath115 , then the unitary operator @xmath56 transforms this state into an eigenstate of @xmath105 and of @xmath35 whose pseudospin orbital eigenvalue is equal to @xmath115 too .",
    "then , one can proceed from case ii to iii and extract the information that the ground states for @xmath80 and @xmath105 have the same value of the orbital pseudospin , i.e. @xmath112 , so that @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "+ in the same way , the unitary operator @xmath82 is mapping an eigenstate of the total spin and of the hamiltonian @xmath80 into an eigenstate with equal total @xmath0 pairing pseudospin and of @xmath84 . + hence by linking via @xmath82 the ground states of i and ii whose one knows the value of the total spin , it is possible to deduce the pseudospin values which are now equal to @xmath118 and @xmath112 , respectively .",
    "after that , we have full knowledge of the symmetry character of the ground state in i and ii as given by @xmath119 and @xmath120 , though it is still missing the information on the @xmath0 pseudospin in the region iii .",
    "= 7.5 cm    it comes natural at this point to enlarge the range of investigation by moving to the case iv which corresponds to the region of parameter space where @xmath25 is negative and @xmath26 is positive as indicated by @xmath121 , where a priori we do not have any indication on the symmetry character of its ground state .",
    "however , the region iv can be reached either via i or iii so that we can extract the complete information on all the quantum numbers and cover the missing points in ii and iii .",
    "the path from i to iv turns out to be useful for determining the spin and orbital pseudospin values while the way to iv via iii can yield the information on the @xmath0 pairing pseudospin so to complete the features for the ground state in these two regions , that is @xmath122 and @xmath123 , respectively .",
    "+ we would like to point out that there is an alternative way to determine the total spin in the ground state which does not go through the perturbative arguments used in steps ii - iii and that it only requires the condition of semi - positive definiteness of the ground state(s ) .",
    "the theorem which refers to this method has been demonstrated and extensively discussed in ref.@xcite and it is based on the condition that a positive definite state and a positive semi - definite state built on the same basis vector space have a nonzero overlap . the key element of this proof is to show that the ground state of the assigned hamiltonian is positive semi - definite and that the ground state of a related spin hamiltonian built on the same lattice and on the same hilbert space is positive definite .",
    "hence the condition of zero overlap between those states ensures that they have the same value of the total spin .",
    "the relevance of this way of proceeding is that so doing one does not have to prove the non - degeneracy of the ground state which is fundamental in the proof that makes use of perturbative like arguments .",
    "+ for the case of hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) , the proof of the semi - positive definiteness of the ground state is not direct because one has to use a set of complete and orthonormal basis built by means of the operators @xmath82 and @xmath56 . indeed , due to the property of spin reflection positivity and to the filling chosen",
    ", one can introduce a set of complete and orthonormal basis of the form @xmath124 , where @xmath125 and @xmath126 with @xmath112 being one of the possible configurations .",
    "then , it is possible to prove that states obtained by an expansion on the previous basis as @xmath127 have the properties of semi - positive definiteness , that is all the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath128 are not less than zero .",
    "+ at this point it is possible to recover the results of steps ii - iii by choosing a spin hamiltonian of the form of @xmath102- @xmath129 whose the ground state is positive definite and use the condition of zero overlap to get the value of the total spin .",
    "+ let consider now few comments about the physical content of the symmetry character of the ground states in the regions i - iv .",
    "one important observation is that @xmath130 is a novel quantum state which shows coexistence of unsaturated ferromagnetic spin and orbital order on a lattice assumed that @xmath131 , in the sense that the ground state exhibits a value of the total spin and orbital momentum which is different from zero and scales as the total number of lattice sites .",
    "moreover , as discussed in ref.@xcite , the state @xmath132 and @xmath133 which have @xmath134 can support odlro ( off diagonal long range order ) as it concerns the long distances pair correlations .",
    "it is striking that even in presence of positive coulomb interaction ( i.e region iv ) one can have an @xmath0 pairing in the ground state .",
    "this can be understood considering that the pairing for a multi - orbital system can come in a higher orbital momentum state induced by the magnetic exchange so that the effect of the local coulomb repulsion is reduced . +",
    "another interesting physical property comes from the @xmath0 pairing symmetry of the ground state of the region ii and iii . due to the value assumed by @xmath0 , it can be shown@xcite that this state can support coexistence of charge density wave ( lro ) and superconductivity ( odlro ) in a phase which is usually indicated as supersolid .",
    "the statement is true in the sense that if lro appears then by symmetry the state manifests also odlro and viceversa .",
    "+ indeed , it comes that due to the rotational invariance of the ground state in the @xmath0 space , the fourier transform of the transverse correlation function at equal time @xmath135 are proportional to the diagonal one @xmath136 , thus if one of the two has the property to stay finite for some value of the momentum @xmath137 in the thermodynamic limit , the same happens for the other one .",
    "in conclusion we have shown that the symmetry features of the ground state at half filling of a generalized hubbard model which includes the hund s rule coupling , can be obtained in a large range of the paramater space , only by combining the property of spin reflection positivity and the use of special unitary transformations .",
    "in particular it has been possible to extract all the most relevant symmetry characteristics related to conservation laws of the hamiltonian that are represented by the orbital , spin and @xmath0 pairing pseudospin operators .",
    "we want to notice that the use of spin reflection positivity has been largely used in literature to rigorously determine the symmetry character and the correlation functions of the ground state for different model hamiltonians . in our work",
    "this idea is generalized and enriched in a simple scheme which takes advantage of the positivity character of the ground state in one region of the parameter space and of the use of symmetry transformations to scan a larger part of the phase diagram .",
    "+ moreover , the procedure presented above gives also the opportunity to extract information on the phase diagram of the model in exam , such as the occurrence of a novel quantum state with coexistence of spin and orbital order , the manifestation of odlro , and where the ground state can be a supersolid .",
    "+ finally , it is worth pointing out that a similar model has been exactly solved in the one - dimensional case in the case of strong coupling regime,@xcite i.e. when the coulomb repulsion is such that the double occupancy of electrons on the same site of the same orbital is excluded ."
