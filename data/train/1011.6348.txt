    "understanding and controlling the transport of electrons is central to the operation of all electrical and electronic devices @xcite . in many cases of interest in nanomaterials ,",
    "the electron transport is coherent , and therefore must be analyzed using the schrdinger equation .",
    "interference effects can then lead to a metal - insulator transition and anderson localization @xcite .",
    "even more than fifty years after anderson s publication of his celebrated paper , the effect remains an active area of study @xcite .",
    "the main goal is to calculate the transmission probability as a function of energy , @xmath0 , for an incoming electron , i.e. the probability that an electron that comes in from @xmath1 can be observed at @xmath2 .",
    "the starting point to quantum calculations of ( spinless ) electrons through a material is often a tight - binding model @xcite .",
    "in such a model each node can be considered an atom , the on - site energy at a node is associated with a potential energy at the site , and there is a hopping term which comes from discretization of the kinetic energy term of the schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "the electron transport calculation via the schrdinger equation thus reduces to the solution of an infinite matrix equation .",
    "the solution of the matrix equation is often accomplished using a green s function method @xcite . in this paper",
    "we instead use an ansatz approach introduced by daboul , chang , and aharony @xcite , which is simpler to describe at an undergraduate level @xcite .",
    "the ansatz reduces the size of the matrix equation to that of the number of tight - binding cites in the scattering volume , plus one for both the incoming lead and the outgoing lead .",
    "this approach has been used by other authors @xcite .",
    "we find that the ansatz approach is particularly well suited to our calculations of transport through hierarchical structures .",
    "to perform the calculation we construct a decimation renormalization group ( rg ) procedure to reduce the number of sites of the hierarchical structure .",
    "our rg is related to that utilized by others for tight - binding models @xcite .",
    "however , our rg has been explicitly constructed for the calculation of the transmission probabilities .",
    "we find that our rg procedure greatly simplifies the calculation , albeit only for certain select networks that have hierarchical structures .",
    "although our rg does not significantly simplify the calculation of associated wavefunctions , we nevertheless give a recipe for the rg calculation of the wavefunctions .",
    "the specific models we solve here for quantum transport are motivated by four considerations .",
    "one is to understand how hierarchical models , in particular the hanoi networks @xcite , affect quantum transport .",
    "the second is that such hierarchical models provide an intermediate between regular lattices and ones that have a small - world property @xcite , and would be of interest to understand quantum transport of nanomaterials that have a small - world property @xcite .",
    "the third is that often phase transitions such as the metal - insulator transition or a ferromagnetic transition have some universal quantities that depend only on the dimension .",
    "hierarchical models then sometimes provide insight into how these universal quantities behave as a function of the dimension @xcite .",
    "lastly , experimental realizations of hierarchical materials may possess novel physical properties @xcite .",
    "the hierarchical models we study are the hanoi networks hn3 and hn5 .",
    "these networks have particularly interesting properties .",
    "first , they are both planar , and consequently could be experimentally constructed on a surface .",
    "second , both networks have typical paths ( defined precisely in sec .  [ sec : graph - structure ] ) that grow more slowly with system size than do paths in regular lattices .",
    "finally , anderson localization is associated with randomness in the system , while randomness in the hanoi networks depends on the scale .",
    "for example , for hn3 locally every site has three bonds connecting it with other sites , choosing sites from hn3 at random the connections to other sites seem random , but these connections are actually from a hierarchical arrangement and hence at the larger scale there is regularity to the network . therefore studying",
    "electron transport and anderson localization in these lattices is of interest .    in section",
    "[ sec : graph - structure ] we provide a brief description of the hanoi networks . for transport properties",
    ", these networks can be connected to the leads in many ways , but we choose to present results only for symmetric linear and symmetric ring lead attachments . in section  [ matrixrg ] we develop the rg equations for calculating the transmission through these networks , with details of the rg presented in appendix  [ sec : appa ] . in section  [ analysis ]",
    "we analyze these rg equations for these networks .",
    "this involves iterating the rg until the system is comprised only of a few lattice points , and these small lattice solutions are presented in appendix  [ sec : appb ] .",
    "section  [ conclusion ] contains our conclusions and a discussion of our results .",
    "the appendices contain the basic matrix algebra used to develop the rg equations .",
    "each of the networks considered in this paper possess a simple geometric backbone , a one - dimensional line of @xmath3 sites formed into a ring as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:3hanoi ] for hn3 and @xmath4 .",
    "alternatively , we can connect the network to the incoming and outgoing leads in a linear arrangement with @xmath5 sites , as depicted in fig .",

    "the top and bottom sites @xmath20 and @xmath21 require special treatment and are connected to external leads . with these connections ,",
    "the entire network becomes 3-regular .",
    "note that the graph is planar . ]",
    "previously @xcite , it was found that the average chemical path  between sites on hn3 scales as @xmath22 with the distance @xmath23 along the backbone . in some ways ,",
    "this property is reminiscent of a square - lattice consisting of @xmath17 lattice sites with diagonal @xmath24 .    while the preceding networks are of a fixed , finite degree , we can extend hn3 in the following manner to obtain a new planar network of average degree 5 , hence called hn5 , at the price of a distribution in the degrees that is exponentially falling .",
    "in addition to the bonds in hn3 , in hn5 we also connect all even sites to both of its nearest neighboring sites _ within _ the same level of the hierarchy @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : numbering ] ) .",
    "the resulting network remains planar but now sites have a hierarchy - dependent degree , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5hanoi ] . to obtain the average degree , we observe that 1/2 of all sites have degree 3 , 1/4 have degree 5 , 1/8 have degree 7 , and so on , leading to an exponentially falling degree distribution of @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "then , the total number of bonds @xmath28 in the ( linear ) system of size @xmath29 is @xmath30 thus , the average degree is @xmath31    in hn5 , the end - to - end distance is trivially 1 , see fig .",
    "[ fig:5hanoi ] .",
    "therefore , we define as the diameter the largest of the shortest paths possible between any two sites , which are typically odd - index sites furthest away from long - distance bonds . for the @xmath32 site network depicted in fig",
    ".  [ fig:5hanoi ] , for instance , that diameter is 5 as measured between site 3 and 19 ( 0 is the left - most site ) , although there are many other such pairs .",
    "it is easy to show recursively that this diameter grows strictly as @xmath33 with @xmath34 the integer portion of @xmath35 .",

    "this broken symmetry is seen by the incoming quantum electrons , and can lead to anderson - type localization . for the hn3 network with variable strength @xmath186 for the small - world - type bonds , we find that the more we weight the small - world links , which classically would _",

    "the network hn5 adds still more small - world type bonds to hn3 , but we find that for any non - zero strength of these additional bonds the band edges seen in hn3 disappear and approximately unfettered transmission is seen for large enough lattices for any energy of the incoming electrons .",
    "thus the hierarchical nature of these lattices lead to very interesting transmission properties .",
    "thus for these hierarchical lattices , the metal - insulator transitions depend on quantities other than just the embedding dimension .",
    "similar effects have been seen for critical phenomena in hierarchical lattices , but only where translational symmetry is broken @xcite .    since the hn3 and hn5 networks are planar ( see for example fig .",
