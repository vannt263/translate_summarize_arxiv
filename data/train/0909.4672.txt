    "theories of gravity , alternative to einstein s general relativity ( gr ) , have been proposed to cure the problems of the standard cosmological model and , above all , because they arise in quantizations of gravity .",
    "these alternative gravitational theories constitute at least an attempt to formulate a semi - classical scheme in which gr and its most successful features can be recovered .",
    "one of the most fruitful approaches thus far has been that of _ extended theories of gravity _ ( etgs ) , which have become a paradigm in the study of the gravitational interaction .",
    "etgs are based on corrections and extensions of einstein s theory .",
    "the paradigm consists , essentially , of adding higher order curvature invariants and/or minimally or non - minimally coupled scalar fields to the dynamics ; these corrections emerge from the effective action of quantum gravity @xcite .    further motivation to modify gr arises from the problem of fully implementing mach s principle in a theory of gravity , which leads one to contemplate a varying gravitational coupling .",
    "mach s principle states that the local inertial frame is determined by the average motion of distant astronomical objects @xcite .",
    "this fact would imply that the gravitational coupling here and now is determined by the distant distribution of matter , and it can be scale - dependent and related to some scalar field . as a consequence ,",
    "the concept of `` inertia '' and the equivalence principle have to be revised .",
    "brans - dicke theory @xcite constituted the first consistent and complete theory alternative to einstein s gr .",
    "brans - dicke theory incorporates a variable gravitational coupling strength whose dynamics are governed by a scalar field non - minimally coupled to the geometry , which implements mach s principle in the gravitational theory @xcite .",
    "independent motivation for extending gravity comes from the fact that every unification scheme of the fundamental interactions , such as superstring , supergravity , or grand unified theories exhibit effective actions containing non - minimal couplings to the geometry or higher order terms in the curvature invariants .",
    "these contributions are one - loop or higher loop corrections in the high - curvature regime approaching the full , and still unknown , quantum gravity regime @xcite .",
    "specifically , this scheme was adopted in the study of quantum field theory on curved spacetime and it was found that interactions between quantum scalar fields and background geometry , or gravitational self - interactions , yield such corrections to the einstein - hilbert lagrangian @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been realized that these corrective terms are inescapable in the effective action of quantum gravity close to the planck energy @xcite .",
    "of course , all these approaches do not constitute a full quantum gravity theory , but are needed as working schemes toward it .    in summary ,",
    "higher order terms in the invariants of the riemann tensor , such as @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , or @xmath7 , and non - minimal coupling terms between scalar fields and geometry such as @xmath8 , have to be added to the effective gravitational lagrangian when quantum corrections are introduced .",
    "these terms occur also in the effective lagrangian of string or kaluza - klein theories when a mechanism of compactification of extra spatial dimensions is used @xcite .    from a conceptual point of view",
    ", there is no _ a priori _ reason to restrict the gravitational lagrangian to a linear function of the ricci scalar @xmath2 minimally coupled with matter @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the idea has been proposed that there are no exact laws of physics , in the sense that the effective lagrangians describing physical interactions could be stochastic functions at the microscopic level .",
    "this property would imply that local gauge invariances and the associated conservation hold only in the low energy limit and the fundamental constants of physics can vary @xcite .    besides fundamental physics motivations",
    ", all these theories have been the subject of enormous attention in cosmology due to the fact that they naturally exhibit an inflationary behaviour which can overcome the shortcomings of the gr - based standard cosmological model .",
    "the cosmological scenarios arising from etgs seem realistic and capable of reproducing observations of the the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that , by means of conformal transformations , the higher order and non - minimally coupled terms can be related to einstein gravity with one or more scalar fields minimally coupled to9 gravity @xcite .",
    "higher order terms always appear as contributions of even order in the field equations .",
    "for example , the term @xmath3 produces fourth order equations @xcite , @xmath9 gives sixth order equations @xcite , @xmath10 eighth order equations @xcite , and so on . by means of a conformal transformation",
    ", any second order derivative term corresponds to a scalar field .. fourth - order gravity corresponds to einstein gravity with one scalar field , sixth - order gravity to einstein gravity with two scalar fields , _ etc .",
    "_ @xcite it is also possible to show that @xmath1 gravity is equivalent not only to a scalar - tensor theory , but also to gr plus an ideal fluid @xcite .",
    "this feature becomes interesting if multiple inflationary events are desired , because an early inflationary stage could select very large scale structures ( observed as clusters of galaxies today ) , while a later inflationary epoch could select smaller scale structures ( observed as galaxies today ) @xcite , with each inflationary era corresponding to the dynamics of a scalar field .",
    "finally , these extended schemes could naturally solve the graceful exit problem bypassing the shortcomings of known inflationary models @xcite .",
    "in addition to the revision of standard cosmology at early epochs with the concept of inflation , a new approach is necessary also at late epochs .",
    "etgs could play a fundamental role also in this context .",
    "in fact , the increasing bulk of data accumulated in the past few years have nurtured a new cosmological model referred to as the _ concordance model_. the hubble diagram of type ia supernovae ( hereafter sneia ) measured by both the supernova cosmology project @xcite and the high-@xmath11 team @xcite up to redshifts @xmath12 , has been the first piece of evidence that the universe is currently undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion .",
    "balloon - born experiments , such as boomerang @xcite and maxima @xcite , have detected the first and second peak in the anisotropy spectrum of the cmb radiation indicating that the geometry of the universe is spatially flat .",
    "in conjunction with constraints on the matter density parameter @xmath13 coming from galaxy clusters , these data indicate that the universe is dominated by an unclustered fluid with negative pressure , generically dubbed _ dark energy _ , which is able to drive the accelerated expansion .",
    "this picture has been further strengthened by the recent precise measurements of the cmb spectrum obtained by the wmap experiment @xcite , and by the extension of the sneia hubble diagram to redshifts higher than one @xcite .",
    "an overwhelming flood of papers has appeared following this observational evidence , presenting a great variety of models trying to explain this phenomenon .",
    "the simplest explanation is the well known cosmological constant @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "although it is the best fit to most of the available astrophysical data @xcite , the @xmath0cdm model fails in explaining why the inferred value of @xmath0 is so tiny ( 120 orders of magnitude smaller ) in comparison with the typical vacuum energy values predicted by particle physics and why its energy density is comparable to the matter density today ( the _ coincidence problem _ ) .    as a tentative solution ,",
    "many authors have replaced the cosmological constant with a scalar field rolling down its potential and giving rise to the model referred to as _ quintessence _",
    "even when successful in fitting the data , the quintessence approach to dark energy is still plagued by the coincidence problem since the dark energy and matter densities evolve differently and reach comparable values for a very limited portion of the cosmic evolution coinciding at the present era . to be more precise ,",
    "the quintessence dark energy is tracking matter and evolves in the same way for a long time .",
    "but then , at late times , somehow it has to change its behavior from tracking the dark matter to dominating as a cosmological constant .",
    "this is the coincidence problem of quintessence .",
    "moreover , the origin of this quintessence scalar field is unknown , leaving a great uncertainty on the choice of the scalar field potential .",
    "the subtle and elusive nature of dark energy has led many authors to look for completely different scenarios able to give a quintessential behavior without the need for exotic components . to this end",
    ", it is worth stressing that the acceleration of the universe only calls for a dominant component with negative pressure , but does not tell us anything about the nature and the number of cosmic fluids filling the universe .",
    "this consideration suggests that it could be possible to explain the accelerated expansion by introducing a single cosmic fluid with an equation of state causing it to act like dark matter at high densities and dark energy at low densities .",
    "an attractive feature of these models , usually referred to as _ unified dark energy _",
    "( ude ) or _ unified dark matter _",
    "( udm ) models , is that such an approach naturally solves , al least phenomenologically , the coincidence problem .",
    "interesting examples are the generalized chaplygin gas @xcite , the tachyon field @xcite and the condensate cosmology @xcite . a different class of ude models has been proposed @xcite in which a single fluid is considered : its energy density scales with the redshift in such a way that the radiation - dominated era , the matter era , and the accelerating phase can be naturally achieved .",
    "these models are very versatile since they can be interpreted both in the framework of ude models and as a two - fluid scenario with dark matter and scalar field dark energy .",
    "the main advantage of this approach is that a suitable generalized equation of state can be always obtained and observational data can be fitted .",
    "there is a yet different way to address the problem of the cosmic acceleration .",
    "as stressed in @xcite , it is possible that the observed acceleration is not the manifestation of another ingredient of the cosmic pie , but rather the first signal of a breakdown of our understanding of the laws of gravitation in the infrared limit .",
    "from this point of view , it is tempting to modify the friedmann equations to see whether it is possible to fit the astrophysical data with models comprising only standard matter .",
    "interesting examples of this kind are the cardassian expansion @xcite and dgp gravity @xcite . in the same framework it is possible to find alternative schemes in which a quintessential behavior is obtained by taking into account effective models coming from fundamental physics and giving rise to generalized or higher order gravity actions @xcite ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review ) .",
    "for instance , a cosmological constant term may be recovered as a consequence of a non - vanishing torsion field , leading to a model consistent with both the sneia hubble diagram and sunyaev - zeldovich data of galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "sneia data could also be efficiently fitted including higher order curvature invariants in the gravitational lagrangian @xcite .",
    "these alternative models provide naturally a cosmological component with negative pressure whose origin is related to the cosmic geometry , thus overcoming the problems linked to the physical significance of the scalar field .    the large number of cosmological models which constitute viable candidates to explain the observed accelerated expansion is evident from this short overview . on the one hand",
    ", this overabundance of models signals the fact that only a limited number of cosmological tests are available to discriminate between competing theories and , on the other hand , it shows that we are facing an urgent degeneracy problem .",
    "it is useful to remark that both the sneia hubble diagram and the angular size - redshift relation of compact radio sources @xcite are distance - based probes of cosmological models , so systematic errors and biases could be iterated . from this point of view , it is interesting to search for tests based on time - dependent observables .",
    "for example , one can take into account the _ lookback time _ to distant objects since this quantity can discriminate between different cosmological models .",
    "the lookback time is observationally estimated as the difference between the present age of the universe and the age of a given object at redshift @xmath11 .",
    "such an estimate is possible if the object is a galaxy observed in more than one photometric band since its color is determined by its age as a consequence of stellar evolution .",
    "it is thus possible to get an estimate of the galaxy age by measuring its magnitude in different bands and then using stellar evolutionary codes to choose the model that best reproduces the observed colors .",
    "coming to the weak - field - limit approximation , which essentially means considering solar system scales , etgs are expected to reproduce gr which , in any case , is firmly tested only in this limit @xcite .",
    "this fact is a matter of debate since several relativistic theories do not reproduce exactly the einsteinian results in the newtonian approximation but , in some sense , generalize them . as first noticed by stelle @xcite ,",
    "an @xmath14-theory gives rise to yukawa - like corrections in the newtonian potential .",
    "this feature could have interesting physical consequences ; for example , certain authors claim to explain the flat rotation curves of galaxies by using such terms @xcite .",
    "others @xcite have shown that a conformal theory of gravity is nothing but a fourth - order theory containing such terms in the newtonian limit .",
    "besides , an apparent , anomalous , long - range acceleration in the data analysis of the pioneer 10/11 , galileo , and ulysses spacecrafts could be framed in a general theoretical scheme by taking into account corrections to the newtonian potential @xcite .    in general , any relativistic theory of gravitation yields corrections to the newtonian and post - newtonian ( ppn ) potentials ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) which test the theory @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the newborn _ gravitational lensing astronomy _",
    "@xcite is generating additional tests of gravity over small , large , and very large scales which soon will provide direct measurements for the variation of the newtonian coupling @xcite , the potential of galaxies , clusters of galaxies and several other features of self - gravitating systems .",
    "such data , very likely , will be capable of confirming or ruling out the physical consistency of gr or of any etg . in summary ,",
    "the general features of etgs are that the einstein field equations are modified in two ways : @xmath15 the geometry can be non - minimally coupled to some scalar field , and/or @xmath16 higher than second order derivatives of the metric appear . in the first case we deal with scalar - tensor theories of gravity",
    "; in the second case we have higher order theories .",
    "combinations of non - minimally coupled and higher order terms can emerge as contributions to effective lagrangians ; then we have higher order - scalar - tensor theories of gravity .    from the mathematical point of view , the problem of reducing generalized theories to an einstein - like form has been extensively discussed . under suitable regularity conditions on the lagrangian and using a legendre transformation on the metric ,",
    "higher order theories take the form of gr in which one or more scalar field(s ) source of the gravitational field ( see , .g . ,",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "as discussed above , the mathematical equivalence between models with variable gravitational coupling and einstein gravity has been studied using suitable conformal transformations @xcite .",
    "a debate on the physical meaning of these conformal transformations seems to be ongoing ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "several authors claim a physical difference between jordan frame ( higher order theories and/or variable gravitational couplings ) since there is experimental and observational evidence suggesting that the jordan frame is better suited for matching solutions and data .",
    "others state that the true physical frame is the einstein one according to the energy theorems @xcite",
    ". however , the discussion is open and no definitive conclusion seems to have been reached .",
    "the problem becomes more involved at the semiclassical and quantum level , and should be faced from a more general point of view ",
    "the palatini approach to gravity could be useful to this goal .",
    "the palatini approach to gravitational theories was first introduced and analyzed by einstein himself @xcite , but was named as a consequence of an historical misunderstanding @xcite .",
    "the fundamental idea of the palatini formalism is to consider the torsion - free connection @xmath17 entering the definition of the ricci tensor , to be independent of the spacetime metric @xmath18 .",
    "the palatini formulation of the standard einstein - hilbert theory turns out to be equivalent to the purely metric theory .",
    "this property follows from the fact that the field equations for the connection @xmath17 , considered to be independent of the metric , produce the levi - civita connection of the metric @xmath18 . as a consequence",
    ", there is no reason to impose the palatini variational principle instead of the metric variational principle in the einstein hilbert theory .",
    "however , the situation changes if we consider the etgs , which depend on functions of the curvature invariants ( such as @xmath1 theories ) or couple non - minimally to some scalar field . in these cases",
    "the palatini and the metric variational principles provide different field equations and the theories thus derived differ @xcite .",
    "the relevance of the palatini approach for cosmological applications in this framework has been recently demonstrated @xcite .    from the physical point of view , considering the metric @xmath18 and the connection @xmath19 as independent fields means to decouple the metric structure of spacetime and its geodesic structure ( the connection @xmath17 , in general , is not the levi - civita connection of @xmath18 ) .",
    "the causal structure of spacetime is governed by @xmath18 while the spacetime trajectories of particles are governed by @xmath17 .",
    "this decoupling enriches the geometric structure of spacetime and generalizes the purely metric formalism .",
    "this metric - affine structure of spacetime is naturally translated , by means of the palatini field equations , into a bi - metric structure of spacetime . besides the physical metric @xmath18",
    ", another metric @xmath20 appears .",
    "this new metric is related , in the case of @xmath1 gravity , to the connection .",
    "the connection @xmath17 turns out to be the levi - civita connection of @xmath21 and provides the geodesic structure of spacetime .    for non - minimally coupled interactions in the gravitational lagrangian in scalar - tensor theories , the new metric @xmath21 is related to the non - minimal coupling ;",
    "@xmath22 can be related to a different geometric and physical aspect of the gravitational theory .",
    "thanks to the palatini formalism , the non - minimal coupling and the scalar field , entering the evolution of the gravitational fields , are separated from the metric structure of spacetime .",
    "the situation mixes when we consider the case of higher order - scalar - tensor theories . due to these features , the palatini approach could contribute to clarify the physical meaning of conformal transformations @xcite .    in this review paper , without claiming for completeness , we want to give a survey on the formal and phenomenological aspects of etgs in metric and palatini approaches , considering the cosmological and astrophysical applications of some etg models .",

    "cosmological applications are considered in sec.[cinque]-[sei ] .",
    "we show that dark energy and the dark matter can be addressed as `` curvature effects '' , if etgs ( in particular @xmath1 theories ) are considered .",
    "we work out some cosmological models comparing the solutions with data coming from observational surveys . as further result in sec .",
    "[ sette ] .",
    ", we show that also the stochastic cosmological background of gravitational waves can be `` tuned '' by etgs .",
    "this fact could open new perspective also in the problems of detection of gravitational waves which should be investigated not only in the standard gr - framework .",
    "discussion and conclusions are drawn in sec.[otto ] .",
    "in this survey we focus on @xmath1 gravity ( see @xcite for a more comprehensive discussion and a list of references , and @xcite for short introductions to the subject ) . in these theories",
    "the einstein - hilbert action is the ricci curvature of the metric tensor @xmath23 , which has determinant @xmath24 , @xmath25 is newton s constant , and @xmath26 .",
    "we mostly follow the notations of ref .  @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath27 is modified to [ actionmetric ] s= d^4x f(r)+s^(m ) , where @xmath1 is a non - linear function of its argument and @xmath28 is the matter part of the action . actually , there are two variational principles that one can apply to the einstein - hilbert action in order to derive einstein s equations : the standard metric variation and a less standard variation dubbed palatini variation . in the latter the metric and the connection",
    "are assumed to be independent variables and one varies the action with respect to both of them , under the important assumption that the matter action does not depend on the connection . the choice of the variational principle is usually referred to as a formalism , so one can use the terms metric ( or second order ) formalism and palatini ( or first order ) formalism . however , even though both variational principles lead to the same field equation for an action whose lagrangian is linear in @xmath2 , this is no longer true for a more general action .",
    "therefore , it is intuitive that there will be two version of @xmath1-gravity , according to which variational principle or formalism is used .",

    "metric @xmath1-gravity _ and @xmath1-gravity in the palatini formalism is called _",
    "palatini @xmath1-gravity_.    finally , there is actually even a third version of @xmath1-gravity : _ metric - affine @xmath1-gravity_. this comes about if one uses the palatini variation but abandons the assumption that the matter action is independent of the connection .",
    "clearly , metric affine @xmath1-gravity is the most general of these theories and reduces to metric or palatini @xmath1-gravity if further assumptions are made . in this section",
    "we will present the actions and field equations of all three versions of @xmath1- gravity and point out their difference .",
    "we will also clarify the physical meaning behind the assumptions that discriminate them .",
    "then brefly has we show above three versions of @xmath1-gravity have been studied : +    * metric ( or second order ) formalism ; + * palatini ( or first order ) formalism ;    and    * metric - affine gravity .",
    "+    these families of theories are discussed in the following .      in the metric formalism",
    "the action is [ metricaction2 ] s_metric = d^4 x f(r)+s^(m ) , and its variation with respect to @xmath29 yields , after some manipulations and modulo surface terms , the field equation [ metricfieldeqs ] f(r)r_- g_=__f(r ) -g _ f(r ) + t _ , with a prime denoting differentiation with respect to @xmath2 , @xmath30 is the covariant derivative associated with the levi - civita connection of the metric , and @xmath31 .",

    "this is already an indication that the field equations of @xmath1 theories will admit a larger variety of solutions than einstein s theory . as an example",
    ", we mention here that the jebsen - birkhoff s theorem , stating that the schwarzschild solution is the unique spherically symmetric vacuum solution , no longer holds in metric @xmath1 gravity . without going into details ,",
    "let us stress that @xmath36 no longer implies that @xmath37 , or is even constant .",

    "another issue that should be stressed is that of energy conservation . in metric @xmath1 gravity",
    "the matter is minimally coupled to the metric .",

    "the same statement can be made at the level of the action .",
    "dynamically equivalent theories give exactly the same results when describing a dynamical system which falls within the purview of these theories .",

    "we examine how @xmath1 gravity performs with regard to these criteria .",
    "according to the tenets of standard cosmology , an acceptable cosmological model must contain an early inflationary era ( or possibly another mechanism ) solving the horizon , flatness , and monopole problems and generating density perturbations , followed by a radiation- and then a matter - dominated era .",

    "therefore , there is no reason to impose the palatini variational principle , instead of the metric variational principle , in the einstein - hilbert theory .",
    "however , the situation is difefrent in etgs containing non - linear functions of the curvature invariants , such as @xmath1 , or non - minimally coupled scalars . in these cases ,",
    "the palatini and the metric variational principle yield different field equations and different physics @xcite .",
    "the relevance of the palatini approach for cosmological applications has been amply demonstrated @xcite .",
    "however , palatini @xmath1 theories could have some problems due to the fact that they could contain non - dynamical scalar field and the initial value problem could be ill - posed . in any case , when the trace of the matter energy - momentum tensor vanishes identically or it is a constant , and when it can be recast in a perfect - fluid form , the cauchy problem results well - formulated and well - posed .    metric - affine gravity has not been developed in sufficient detail to assess its viability according to all the criteria presented here , and its cosmological consequences are essentially unexplored .",
    "it seems fair to say that @xmath1 theories of gravity can help to progress in our understanding of the peculiarities of gr in the wider landscape of relativistic theories of gravity .",
    "furthermore , these theories point out important aspects of generalizations of gr , and , from a phenomenological point of view , constitute viable alternatives to dark energy models in explaining the cosmic acceleration , and to dark matter in reproducing dynamical features as the galactic rotation curves or the halo of clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "finally , it is possible to `` tune '' the stochastic background of gws and this occurrence could constitute a further cosmological test capable of confirming or ruling out etgs once data from interferometers , like virgo , ligo and lisa , will be available ( see @xcite for a discussion on this topic ) . at present , no definite prediction sets @xmath1 theories apart from dark energy and other models once and for all , but it is hoped that progress will me made in this direction .",
