    "measuring the magnetic and velocity fields on the sun is the key to understanding the solar activity and fine structure of sunspots , filaments , _",
    "etc_. one of the main techniques techniques for measuring solar magnetic and velocity fields involves spectroscopy , which can be carried out using either a high - resolution spectrograph or a tunable narrow - band filter in an imaging system @xcite .",
    "imaging spectroscopy allows us to obtain two - dimensional images ( with certain field - of - view ( fov ) ) of the solar surface but requires scanning across multiple wavelength positions to build up the spectra . on the other hand ,",
    "a slit - based spectrograph obtains the spectra but requires scanning across the fov spatially to build  up a two - dimensional image of the solar surface @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the observations from ground - based telescopes are affected by atmospheric turbulence .",
    "a number of _ post - facto _ techniques exist for imaging and imaging spectroscopy to deal with effects of atmospheric turbulence , but these techniques are still evolving for observations from a slit - based spectrograph @xcite .",
    "conventionally , narrow - band imaging and imaging spectroscopy can be carried out by using wavelength - tunable lyot filters @xcite , which can be slow because of mechanical movements involved in the tuning process .",
    "using fast tunable narrow - band filters , two - dimensional images can be obtained by scanning across the spectral lines in shorter time periods ( depending upon the number of wavelengths to be scanned along the line profile ) .",
    "two - dimensional images , with sparsely sampled spectral information , provide sufficient opportunity to use inversion techniques to retrieve the magnetic and velocity fields @xcite .",
    "for example , the _ crisp imaging spectropolarimeter _",
    "( crisp : ) installed at the swedish 1-m telescope records stokes images at 11 positions along the line profile of fe  i at 6302   in steps of 48  m. the stokes images were processed with the milne - eddington inversion software helium line information extractor ( helix ) @xcite to obtain the atmospheric parameters . used crisp data to study the fine structure of the sunspot penumbra . also used the stokes vector maps of the quiet sun obtained with the imaging magnetograph experiment ( imax ) on the _ sunrise _",
    "@xcite telescope , to study the magnetic connectivity between the layers of the solar atmosphere .",
    "imax samples the line profile of fe i at 5250.2   at a maximum of 12 positions . in this case , the inversion code very fast inversion of the stokes vector ( vfisv ) developed by is used to obtain atmospheric parameters . used the data to obtain the 3d structure of magnetic loops using extrapolation methods .",
    "similarly , the _ interferometric bidimensional spectrometer _ ( ibis ) @xcite installed at the _ dunn solar telescope _ at sacramento peak ( new mexico , usa ) records multiwavelength observations of the solar atmosphere to understand various solar phenomena .",
    "it scans the line profiles of fe  i , h@xmath0 , and ca  ii at 14 , 22 , and 21 positions , respectively .",
    "some of the recent instruments use fabry - perot etalons to achieve narrow - band imaging with a fast cadence @xcite .",
    "however , the electro - optically tunable solid - state etalons provide a smaller wavelength shift than air - spaced etalons for the same fov because of their higher refractive index .",
    "this makes solid - state etalons of electro - optical materials such as lithium niobate ( ln ) useful for a larger fov @xcite .",
    "after the successful use in ground - based and balloon - borne experiments , ln etalons have also been proposed for some of the future space experiments such as _ solar orbiter _",

    "using the etalons in tandem effectively increases the free spectral range ( fsr ) and the spectral resolution of the system @xcite .",
    "although inter - reflections between multi - etalons cause ghost images , these can be eliminated or minimized either by tilting the etalons with respect to each other , or by placing a prefilter in between the etalons or by both @xcite .",
    "the etalons for the imager at uso were procured from the common wealth scientific and industrial research organization ( csiro ) , australia .",
    "table  1 lists their relevant specifications .",
    "the imager will be used as a back - end instrument with the _ multi - application solar telescope _ ( mast ) ( , @xcite , ) .",
    "mast is an off - axis gregorian a - focal telescope with a clear aperture of 50  cm .",
    "this telescope was developed by advanced mechanical and optical systems ( amos ) , belgium , and has been installed at the lake site of uso , india .",
    "along with a polarimeter , the imager will be used for measuring the magnetic and velocity fields of active regions in the photosphere and chromosphere .",
    "the initial aim is to carry out quasi - simultaneous observations in the two solar spectral lines fe i at 6173  , and ca ii at 8542  , which are formed in the photosphere and chromosphere , respectively .    in this article",
    ", we discuss the calibration of the ln etalons in detail and evaluate their suitability for observations at the two spectral lines mentioned above . in section  2",
    "we discuss various tuning options for the ln etalons , and in section  3 the optical set - up used to calibrate of these etalons is described .",
    "results obtained from the voltage and temperature tuning of the system are explained in section 4 .",
    "some of the preliminary images taken with the imager are shown in section  5 .",
    "fabry - perot ( fp ) etalons produce a transmission spectrum ( commonly known as channels ) according to the airy formula @xcite , @xmath13 where @xmath14 ,  @xmath15 ,  @xmath16 . here ,",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 are the coefficients of the reflectance of the surfaces and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the incident and transmitted intensities , respectively .",
    "@xmath21 , @xmath22 , and * @xmath23 * are the refractive index of the medium , spacing between the reflective surfaces , and the angle of refraction , respectively .",
    "the working principle of the ln fabry - perot etalon is the same as that of any other etalon , except that the ( partially ) reflecting surfaces consist of highly polished faces of a ln wafer .",
    "thus the crystal itself acts as a medium between the reflecting surfaces . to tune the etalon to different wavelengths ,",
    "the electro - optic property of the ln substrate is used . applying a voltage to this substrate in effect",
    "changes the refractive index of the crystal and thus produces a shift in the wavelength of the transmission channel @xcite .",
    "the etalons used in this work are made of a birefringent , uni - axial z - cut ln crystal .",
    "the light propagating along the z - axis experiences a single refractive index ( @xmath24 ) , which can be altered by the application of an electric field .",
    "the change in the refractive index ( @xmath25 ) ( neglecting the effect of converse piezoelectric effect ) is given by    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the refractive index of the ordinary ray at wavelength @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the electric field produced by the application of the voltage ( @xmath30 ) , and @xmath31 is the relevant un - clamped electro - optic coefficient .",
    "the change in wavelength with the application of the voltage is given by , @xmath32    this is the most often used property of the ln crystal for tuning the filter to different wavelengths .",
    "the tuning rate is of the order of 200500  m  s@xmath33 depending on the thickness of the etalon . to tune the etalon for the entire wavelength range within two transmission peaks ,",
    "the minimum voltage required is half the fsr voltage , which is given by @xmath34 .",
    "half the fsr voltages estimated for 6173   and 8542   are around 5000  v and 8000  v , respectively .",
    "this is more than the recommended safe voltage for ln etalons ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the other two options for tuning the ln etalons are by varying the temperature and tilt of the etalons . tilting the etalons changes the peak wavelength position , and for small angles",
    "the change in wavelength is given by @xmath35 .",
    "in our experiment , the temperature tunability was used to fix the initial position of the transmission channel at the optimum wavelength position . using voltage tuning ,",
    "the desired spectral lines were then scanned .",
    "we have not explored the tilt tunability of the etalons in the present set - up .",
    "sections  4.2 and 4.3 describe the temperature and voltage tuning of individual etalons , respectively , and table  3 shows the values obtained after tuning .",
    "section 4.4 describes the tuning of the etalons in tandem .",
    "for the test and calibration of the ln etalons , we used a littrow spectrograph set - up as shown in figure 1 , in conjunction with a coud telescope with a 15  cm clear aperture as the light feed .",
    "the f@xmath3630 beam ( see figure  1 ) from the telescope was collimated and reimaged using lenses l@xmath6 and l@xmath8 .",
    "light passing through the slit ( of width 100 @xmath37 m ) was collimated using a lens of focal length 150  cm .",
    "the collimated light dispersed by a plane grating ( 1200 l / mm ) was reimaged using the same littrow lens .",
    "the spectrum obtained was magnified by a factor of two at the ccd plane using relay lenses l3 and l4 . on the ccd ,",
    "the dispersion _ per _ pixel ( pixel size = 6.45  @xmath37 m ) is 17.45  m and 14.85  m at 6173   and 8542  , respectively .",
    "the spectral coverage of the spectrograph is 17.8   and 15.2   at 6173   and 8542  , respectively .",
    "the ln etalons ( fp@xmath6 and fp@xmath8 ) and the prefilter were introduced in the collimated beam after l1 . for imaging , a beam - steering mirror ( bsm )",
    "was inserted in the optical path before l2 to reflect the light toward a lens of focal length 75 cm .",
    "this makes a final f@xmath3630 beam , with an image scale of around 0.3 arcsec _ per _ pixel on the ccd camera .",
    "two different optical configurations are generally employed for imaging spectroscopy : a ) fp etalons in a collimated beam near the re - imaged pupil plane , and b ) fp etalons in a telecentric configuration .",
    "the merits and demerits of both configurations have been explained by and . however , as our primary goal is to characterize the etalons , we preferred a collimated set - up100 will be chosen in the future for solar observations using this instrument with mast . ] .",
    "a maximum blue shift of 11  m is expected at 6173   due to the collimated set - up .",
    "figure  [ spectrum ] shows the plots of the solar spectrum obtained with our spectrograph set - up and that taken from the bass2000 , ] solar survey spectral atlas for comparison .",
    "channel spectra of both ln etalons were recorded by placing them in a collimated beam after lens l1 .",
    "figure  3 shows the spectra obtained with the optical set - up .",
    "the top panel show the solar spectra , which include the 6173   ( left ) and 8542   ( right ) spectral lines .",
    "the remaining three panels , from top to bottom , show the transmission channels for fp@xmath6 ( thinner , 226 ) , fp@xmath8 ( thicker , 577 ) and the fps in tandem in logarithmic scale .",
    "it is worth noting that the fsr ( wavelength separation between two transmission peaks ) increases for the tandem configuration . from these measurements , we computed various parameters for the fps that are essential for using them in the imager set - up at specific wavelengths .",
    "some of the important estimated parameters are the fsr , the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , and voltage and temperature tuning rates . in the following sections , we discuss the methodology adopted to obtain these parameters .",
    "the recorded channel spectra were analyzed to obtain the fsr and the fwhm for the fps individually and in tandem .",
    "the central 200 pixels of the recorded spectrum corresponding to a fov of one arcmin were averaged in the slit direction to obtain the transmission profile of the etalons .",
    "the wavelength scale was calculated from the solar spectra , which were recorded before placing the etalons in the beam path .",
    "we have used almost all the channels in our recorded channel spectrum to compute the mean fsr and fwhm .",
    "table  2 shows the measured values of these parameters .",
    ".measured values of the fsr and fwhm of the fps [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath9:voltage tuning rate , @xmath10:crossover voltage , @xmath38:half - fsr voltage +      the etalons were tuned in tandem using the values obtained after temperature and voltage tuning of the individual etalons .",
    "the temperature for fp@xmath6 and fp@xmath8 was fixed at 30@xmath39c and 35@xmath39c , respectively .",
    "the voltage - tuning values indicated in figure  5 and listed in table  3 were used to tune the etalons in tandem to scan the line profiles .",
    "crossover voltages of the individual etalons were used to obtain the transmission profile of the fps in tandem at the center of the lines of interest , and the voltage - tuning rates were used to set the transmission peaks of both etalons to the same wavelength .",
    "for example , the ratio of the voltage - tuning rates of fp@xmath6 and fp@xmath8 at 6173   and 8542   are 2.413 and 2.396 , respectively .",
    "this means that fp@xmath8 requires 2.413  v for each 1  v change of fp@xmath6 to shift the transmission channel to the same wavelength position .",
    "similarly , it requires 2.396  v for observations at 8542  .",
    "the scanning of the spectral line in any desired wavelength step can be carried out by a control program provided the voltage tuning rates and crossover voltages are known .",
    "after carrying out the calibration runs using the spectrograph , the collimated beam from the fps was diverted toward the imaging system using a beam - steering mirror ( bsm ) as described in section 3 . a filter wheel with two interference filters centered on 6173   ( fwhm = 3.0  ) and 8542   ( fwhm = 3.5  ) was employed to select the desired wavelength ( channel ) for observations .",
    "a series of images was obtained by tuning the etalons in tandem across different wavelength positions on both spectral lines .",
    "images acquired at different wavelength positions are shown in figure 6 .",
    "figure  7 shows a magnified view of the images taken in the line center at 6173   and 8542  , respectively .",
    "observations in 6173   were obtained on 3 april 2013 , the sunspot observed was part of the active region ( ar ) noaa 11711 located at s17e24 on the solar disk .",
    "observations in 8542   were obtained on 8 march 2013 , the filament that is seen in the image was located on the disk at s35e25 near ar 11689 .",
    "for the 6173   line , the images were obtained from -150  m to + 210  m from line center , with a step of 30  m , whereas the line profile at 8542   was scanned from -225  m to + 150  m in a step of 75  m. it is noteworthy here that the quality of these images is affected by the poor seeing conditions at the site . using similar observations obtained for the quiet sun",
    ", we retrieved the profiles for both spectral lines ( figure 8) .",
    "the mean intensity of the quiet sun after flat - fielding and dark - current correction were used in retrieving these line profiles . as evident , because of the limited tunability of the filter , we were unable to retrieve the complete line profile of the 8542   line .",
    "the exposure times used to obtain each filtergram in 6173   and 8542   are 120  ms and 900  ms , respectively .",
    "however , with a 50 cm telescope the exposure times are expected to be of the order of 50  ms and 300  ms , respectively , to build the signal to a level of 80@xmath40 of the full - well capacity ( _ i.e. _ 16000 e@xmath41 ) of the ccd .",
    "we demonstrated the use of two lithium niobate etalons ( fp@xmath6 and fp@xmath8 ) in tandem for quasi - simultaneous narrow - band observations in fe  i ( 6173  ) and ca  ii  ( 8542  ) .",
    "temperature and voltage - tuning calibrations for both etalons were carried out using a littrow spectrograph .",
    "the temperatures of fp@xmath6 and fp@xmath8 were fixed at 30@xmath39c and 35@xmath39c , respectively .",
    "the ratio of voltage - tuning rates of fp@xmath6 and fp@xmath8 at 6173   and 8542   were found to be 2.413 and 2.396 , respectively .",
    "the computed values of the @xmath31 coefficients for the lithium niobate crystals were found to be of the order of 5.2  pmv@xmath33and 4.5  pmv@xmath33at 6173   and 8542  , respectively .",
    "a coud telescope with a clear aperture of 15  cm was used to obtain the test images in both lines .",
    "the line profiles of these two lines of interest were retrieved using quiet - sun observations . however , given the limitations , the system can scan the 8542   line only partially .",
    "this system will be integrated with the upcoming solar telescope , mast , in about mid-2014 .",
