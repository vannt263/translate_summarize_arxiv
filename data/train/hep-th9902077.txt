    "the open inflation model proposed recently by hawking - turok @xcite revived an interest in the wave functions of quantum cosmology , and provoked a debate on the boundary conditions of the universe @xcite .",
    "the present lorentzian spacetime is supposed to emerge quantum mechanically from a euclidean spacetime .",
    "leading proposals for such wave functions are the hartle - hawking s no - boundary wave function @xcite , the linde s wave function @xcite and the vilenkin s tunneling wave function @xcite .",
    "though there has not still been an unanimous agreement on the boundary condition of the universe , it is generally accepted that the universe which tunneled quantum mechanically the euclidean spacetime should have either an exponentially growing or decaying wave function or a combination of both branches @xcite .",
    "but the issue of quantum theory of matter fields in a topology changing universe such as the tunneling universe has not been raised seriously yet .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to investigate a consistent quantum theory of a scalar field in the euclidean region of the topology changing universe such as the tunneling universe and to construct quantum states explicitly there . to treat the quantum field in a curved spacetime there",
    "have been used two typical methods : in the conventional approach the underlying spacetime is fixed as a background and matter field is quantized on it @xcite , and in the other approach known as the semiclassical ( quantum ) gravity the semiclassical einstein equation with the quantum back - reaction of matter field and the time - dependent schrdinger equation are derived from the wheeler - dewitt equation for the gravity - matter system @xcite . in both approaches the functional schrdinger equation for the scalar field in the euclidean region obeys a non - unitary ( diffusion - like ) evolution equation .",
    "so the quantization rules of the minkowski spacetime may not be applied directly . to construct the consistent quantum theory in the euclidean region",
    "we propose a method in which one first quantizes the wick - rotated gravity - matter system of the euclidean geometry , derives the time - dependent schrdinger equation and then transforms back via the wick rotation the quantum states into those of the lorentzian geometry .",
    "this method is consistent because the wick rotations are well defined and so does the time - dependent schrdinger equation in the euclidean region in the euclidean geometry just as in the lorentzian region of the lorentzian geometry .",
    "it is also useful in that one is able to find the quantum states explicitly using the liouville - neumann method which has already been used to find quantum states of the scalar field in the lorentzian regions of spacetime @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we quantize the gravity - scalar system in the lorentzian geometry and derive the semiclassical einstein equation and the time - dependent schrdinger equation from the wheeler - dewitt equation in the lorentzian region where the gravitational wave function oscillates .",
    "the region where the gravitational wave function exhibits an exponential behavior corresponds to a euclidean region of spacetime .",
    "we focus in particular on the schrdinger equation in the euclidean region of spacetime . in sec .",
    "iii we quantize the euclidean gravity ( geometry ) coupled to the minimal scalar field and derive the time - dependent schrdinger equation together with the semiclassical einstein equation in the region corresponding to the euclidean region of the lorentzian geometry .",
    "quantum states are found using the liouville - neumann method . in sec .",
    "iv the wick rotation is employed to transform these quantum states defined in terms of the euclidean geometry into those defined in terms of the lorentzian geometry .",
    "as a simple but interesting quantum cosmological model , let us consider the closed frw universe minimally coupled to an inflaton , a minimal scalar field .",

    "before we derive the equation for quantum fields in the euclidean region , we review briefly how to obtain the time - dependent schrdinger equation in the lorentzian region from the semiclassical ( quantum ) gravity point of view . in the lorentzian region , where the wave function for the gravitational field oscillates , we first adopt the born - oppenheimer idea to expand the total wave function according to different mass scales @xmath10 and obtain the gravitational field equation with the back - reaction of matter field @xcite",

    "let us remind that @xmath61 is a wick rotation of @xmath62 , as will be shown later .",

    "however , the wave function for the quantized euclidean geometry oscillates in this region , in contrast with the exponential behavior of the wave function for the quantized lorentzian geometry .",
