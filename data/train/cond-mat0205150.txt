    "the observation of the colossal magnetoresistance effect ( cmr )  @xcite in doped manganese oxides with perovskite structure , r@xmath2a@xmath3mno@xmath4 ( r = rare - earth , a = alkaline - earth metal ) , moved these materials into the focus of intense research activity  @xcite .",
    "it turned out soon that the complex electronic and magnetic properties of the manganites depend on a close interplay of almost all degrees of freedom known in solid state physics , namely itinerant charges , localised spins , orbitals , and lattice vibrations . on the one hand ,",
    "the strong coulomb interaction @xmath5 and the hund s rule coupling @xmath6 introduce a spin background and affect the charge mobility via double - exchange  @xcite . on the other hand , the cubic environment of the mn sites within the perovskite lattice results in a crystal field splitting of mn-@xmath7-orbitals into @xmath8 and @xmath9 and",
    "gives rise to an orbital degeneracy in the ground - state of mn@xmath10 ions .",
    "this orbital degeneracy , in turn , connects the electronic system to the lattice , making it sensible to jahn - teller distortion and polaronic effects  @xcite .",
    "there are numerous attempts to describe the electronic ( i.e. , charge , spin , and orbital ) interactions of the manganites on a microscopic level ( see , e.g. , refs .  )",
    ". however , most of these models do not reflect the full multiplet structure of the mn ions caused by the cubic site symmetry or violate the spin rotational invariance . to our knowledge ,",
    "feiner and ols  @xcite were the first who derived a consistent spin - orbital model for the undoped compounds . in the following",
    "we extend their derivation to the case of finite doping and complete the resulting electronic model with dynamic electron - lattice interactions of jahn - teller and breathing type .",
    "up to now models of similar complexity have only been discussed on the basis of rather extensive approximations , where mean - field approaches are probably the most popular .",
    "in particular , the lattice was always treated within the adiabatic approximation which is questionable in view of the comparable energy scales of spins and phonons . for a better understanding of this complex many body system",
    "we prefer to consider all interactions on an equal footing . using exact diagonalisation techniques we study the ground - state properties of the derived model on a four site cluster .    for the hole doped region ( @xmath1 )",
    "our calculations show how the lattice can effectively control the spin and orbital correlations and the charge mobility . in the undoped compounds the electron - phonon interaction suppresses the coupling of spin and orbital degrees of freedom and is most effective in determining orbital order . at doping @xmath11 , where ferromagnetism is stabilised by the double - exchange mechanism ,",
    "the coupling to the lattice can cause self - trapping of the charge carriers , which immediately switches the spin order . in turn , this change is reflected in dynamic lattice correlations , namely the bond length fluctuation .",
    "for the half - doped manganites we find that the electron - phonon coupling enhances the susceptibility for charge ordering which is present already due to the strong coulomb interaction .",
    "in addition , moderate variations in the strength of the electron - lattice coupling trigger pronounced changes in spin and orbital correlations .",
    "this relates to the complicated patterns of spin , charge and orbital ordering observed experimentally for different manganites at @xmath12 .",
    "the electronic and magnetic properties of the mixed - valence manganites are governed by the manganese @xmath7-electrons , which are divided into @xmath9 and @xmath8 according to the cubic symmetry within the crystal field . due to the large coulomb and hund s rule interactions each of the three @xmath9 and the two @xmath8 levels carries at most one electron and the spins of several @xmath7-electrons",
    "are aligned in parallel at every site ( see figure  [ figlevels ] ) .",
    "starting from the undoped compounds with only mn@xmath10 ions doping will remove @xmath8-electrons .",
    "hence , the local electronic hilbert space can be restricted to the large hund s rule ionic ground - states of manganese ions in a cubic crystal field ( see ref .  ) . for mn@xmath10 ( @xmath13 )",
    "this corresponds to the spin-@xmath14 orbital doublet @xmath15 [ @xmath16 , @xmath17 and for mn@xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) to the spin-@xmath20 orbital singlet @xmath21 [ @xmath22 , @xmath23 here the operators @xmath24 create spin @xmath25 electrons in the @xmath8 ( @xmath26 ) or @xmath9 ( @xmath27 ) orbitals and @xmath28 raises the on - site spin .",

    "the shaded region corresponds to @xmath31 terms , the other terms are proportional to @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 denotes different nonnegative prefactors of @xmath6 ( see eq .  ) . ]",
    "the overlap of neighbouring manganese @xmath7 and oxygen @xmath34 orbitals allows for a tunneling of the manganese electrons between adjacent sites . due to the specific symmetry of the involved orbitals",
    "this hopping acquires an anisotropy  @xcite , @xmath35 +    \\text{h.c.}\\,,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] which can be expressed in terms of the spatial rotations @xmath36 the transfer amplitudes @xmath37 and @xmath38 of @xmath8 and @xmath9 electrons are small compared to the local energies @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "therefore the mobility of the @xmath8 electrons depends on the correlations of the spin background formed by the @xmath9 electrons .",
    "their kinetic energy is maximal , if neighbouring spins are aligned ferromagnetically , which is the essence of the well known double - exchange interaction  @xcite .",
    "second order processes in @xmath37 and @xmath38 are responsible for numerous superexchange interactions between the localised spins , which inherit the orbital anisotropy of the hopping .    the electronic part of our model is derived by second order degenerate perturbation theory  @xcite , i.e. , we calculated the matrix elements of @xmath39 between the basis states   or   and all admissible excited states  @xcite . in figure  [ figvirtual ]",
    "the spin part of the fifteen different virtual excitations contributing to the superexchange is summarised graphically .",
    "we neglect terms which involve three different lattice sites .    a compact expression for the resulting electronic hamiltonian , @xmath40 is obtained by rewriting the orbital and charge degrees of freedom of the basis states  ( [ eq5ebase ] ) and  ( [ eqa2base ] ) in terms of new fermi operators @xmath41 and projectors @xmath42 , @xmath43 note that these projectors are related to the common pseudo - spin operators @xmath44 by the equation @xmath45 . since the amplitude of the on - site spin is different for the basis states  ( [ eq5ebase ] ) and  ( [ eqa2base ] ) , it is convenient to represent the spin degree of freedom by schwinger bosons @xmath46 and @xmath47 which allow for a uniform description .",

    "the second order in @xmath37 and @xmath38 appears to be more involved , since the number of accessible virtual excitations is rather large ( see figure  [ figvirtual ] ) .",

    "the hilbert space of the complete microscopic model , @xmath77 is large and grows rapidly with the system size . however , using a density matrix based optimisation procedure  @xcite for the phonon subsystem we are able to retain the full quantum dynamics of the lattice and the electronic subsystem in our numerical calculation  @xcite of the ground - state properties .",
    "in addition we take into account some of the discrete symmetries of the model , namely the conservation of the @xmath78 component of the spin , the particle number conservation , and the mirror symmetries orthogonal to the @xmath79 and @xmath80 axes ( dot - dashed in figure  [ figcluster ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the typical dimension of the eigenvalue problem is of the order of @xmath81 and its repeated solution during the phonon optimisation requires the use of large scale computers .          the undoped manganese oxides ( la@xmath82@xmath82mno@xmath4 , pr@xmath82@xmath82mno@xmath4 ) usually exhibit a - type anti - ferromagnetic order and strong jahn - teller distortion of the ideal perovskite structure  @xcite . the origin of the observed magnetic order has been subject to discussions . while different band structure calculations  @xcite emphasise the importance of lattice distortions for the stability of anti - ferromagnetism , feiner and ole  @xcite favoured a purely electronic mechanism .",

    "such type of asymmetry seems surprising in view of the invariance of the cluster with respect to diagonal reflections ( dot - dot - dashed in figure  [ figcluster ] ) .",
    "however , since this symmetry is not taken into account in the calculation the system is trapped in one particular linear combination of two degenerate ground - states and different expectation values in @xmath79 and @xmath80 direction can evolve . at larger electron - phonon coupling @xmath84",

    "the change of orbital , spin and phonon correlations with increasing @xmath84 is shown schematically .",
    "this , however , is a rather suggestive picture , which can not cover all the details of the various correlations . to select the appropriate graphical representation for the orbital arrangement we study the @xmath115-eigenstates of reduced orbital density matrices . on a bond @xmath116",

    "of course , the calculated ordering patterns can not be directly compared to experimental observations for the three dimensional compounds .",
