    "the central regions of the dwarf spiral galaxy ngc  4395 show most of the common signatures of nuclear activity .",
    "the optical and ultraviolet ( uv ) spectra reveal prominent high - ionization forbidden lines on top of a nearly featureless continuum , and broad wings corresponding to gas velocities in excess of @xmath010@xmath7  km  s@xmath8 are detected in the permitted lines ( filippenko & sargent 1989 ) .",
    "contrary to the objects of the same kind , the emission - line properties , the optical to x - ray variability pattern and the inferred accretion rate of ngc  4395 are those typical of the seyfert class , of which this source is usually considered to represent the least luminous member .",
    "different methods have been employed in the last years to derive the mass of its central black hole : the estimate obtained through reverberation mapping is @xmath9 ( peterson et al .",
    "2005 ) , but the lack in this galaxy of a significant bulge and the stringent upper limit of 30  km  s@xmath8 on its velocity dispersion suggest an even lower value , of the order of @xmath010@xmath1010@xmath1 ( filippenko & ho 2003 ) . anyhow , the engine of ngc  4395 falls somewhere between the stellar - mass black holes found in galactic x - ray binaries and the supermassive black holes residing inside active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "as such , it can provide critical information about the relationship between these two populations and the physics of accretion systems in general .",
    "+ in the light of all these pieces of observational evidence , ngc  4395 is a true scaled - down version of an ordinary seyfert galaxy , the only difference with respect to its high - luminosity counterparts being the much smaller mass of the central black hole . on the other hand ,",
    "the x - ray observations of this source indicate an unusual spectral hardness at @xmath0210  kev , and suggest a wide range of variations for the intrinsic photon index . the most extreme states ( @xmath11 ; moran et al .",
    "2005 ) are even difficult to interpret within the standard two - phase model ( haardt & maraschi 1991 ) , posing serious questions on the production mechanism of the x - ray emission itself . the presence of undetected absorption effects has been frequently invoked as a possible explanation .",
    "indeed , the stronger flux variability characterizing systematically the soft x - ray bands can be attributed to a complex , multi - zone warm absorber , whose properties have been discussed in detail in several works ( iwasawa et al . 2000 ; shih , iwasawa & fabian 2003 ; dewangan et al .",
    "here we review the two highest - quality observations of ngc  4395 , performing in both cases an accurate time - resolved analysis mainly focused on neutral absorption , in order to test whether changes of its column density and/or covering factor play a role in the apparent x - ray spectral hardness of this source .",
    "the longest _ xmm - newton _ monitoring of ngc  4395 started on 2003 november 30 , for a total duration of @xmath0113  ks .",
    "after the subtraction of high - background periods , the useful exposure declines to 91.4  ks .",
    "we also take into account the deep _ suzaku _ observation , which was carried out on 2007 june 25 over a span of @xmath0230  ks , corresponding to a net integration time of 101.3  ks .",
    "we have followed the standard procedures for the reduction of the event files , and extracted the source and background spectra from circular regions with radii of 30(_xmm - newton _ ) and 2(_suzaku _ ) . in the first case , for the sake of clarity",
    "only epic - pn data are presented here and plotted in the figures , even though the mos spectra have been checked throughout and give fully consistent results ; in the second one , instead , only the data from the front - illuminated detectors of the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) have been examined , after merging the xis0 and xis3 spectra .",
    "the spectral analysis has been performed using the xspec v12.6 fitting package .",
    "all the uncertainties are given at the 90 per cent confidence level ( @xmath12 ) for the single parameter of interest .",
    "we first restricted our analysis to the energies above 1  kev , following the customary approach of fitting the spectrum averaged over the whole observation to obtain a benchmark model .",
    "we achieved a fully acceptable fit ( @xmath13 for 1390 degrees of freedom , with no obvious structure in the residuals ) through a simple model consisting of a power law with photon index @xmath14 , a narrow iron emission line with equivalent width @xmath15  ev , and a partial neutral absorber whose column density and covering fraction are @xmath16  @xmath5 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "@xmath5 ( kalberla et al . 2005 ) . ]",
    "no reflection component is strictly required for the continuum : however , by adding a pexrav model ( magdziarz & zdziarski  1995 ) for physical consistency and forcing its strength to match the width of the narrow iron line , the fit is slightly improved ( @xmath18 with the loss of one d.o.f . ) and the power - law photon index steepens to @xmath19 . both cases above yield a formally satisfactory fit , yet the flat slope of the intrinsic continuum deserves a thorough investigation .",
    "this result would actually confirm one of the most remarkable features of ngc  4395 , which had been previously caught by _",
    "chandra _ even in harder states ( see moran et al .",
    "2005 ) . in any case , the typical value of @xmath201.5 is still unusually low , compared with both the distribution of photon indices found in local agn ( e.g. bianchi et al .",
    "2009 ) and the average 15150  kev spectrum of the source measured by the burst alert telescope ( bat ) onboard _ swift _ ( @xmath21 ; fig .  [ bm ] ) . + a viable explanation for such a discrepancy is the presence of a complex ( variable ) absorber , strongly modifying the observed spectral shape of ngc  4395 below @xmath010  kev .",
    "the extrapolation of the basic model down to 0.5 kev supports this working assumption : the apparent extra emission at 0.50.7  kev , in fact , hints at absorption effects in the @xmath00.71.5  kev range rather than at a genuine soft excess like the one detected in a large fraction of seyfert galaxies ( e.g. boller , brandt & fink 1996 ; porquet et al . 2004 ) .",
    "moreover , a clearly time - dependent behaviour of the x - ray source is revealed not only by the overall flux light curve but also by the hardness ratio ( hr ) evolution .",
    "it is well established that ngc  4395 is characterized by strong variations of the x - ray flux on time - scales as short as a few hundreds of seconds ( fig .",
    "[ lc ] , upper panel ) : the fractional rms variability amplitude during the _ xmm - newton _ observation under review is exceptionally high ( @xmath090 per cent at 0.52  kev ; see vaughan et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    ".,width=321 ]        on top of these fluctuations of the intrinsic x - ray brightness , mainly related to the workings of the primary source , significant _ spectral _ variations are also evident from the visual inspection of the hr light curve ( fig",
    ".  [ lc ] , lower panel ) .",
    "the observed hr pattern can be accounted for through either changes of the column density or , alternatively , oscillations of the continuum slope : this proves that a time - averaged spectral analysis is not sufficient to fully understand the nature of the x - ray emission of ngc  4395 .",
    "the hardness ratio is defined here as the ratio between the 510  kev and the 25  kev flux , thus it is especially sensitive to values of @xmath22 of the order of 10@xmath310@xmath4  @xmath5 . as already mentioned ,",
    "the spectral complexity and the larger fractional rms variability below @xmath02  kev are likely due instead to a multi - zone warm absorber , whose presence has been revealed since the early _ asca _ observations of the source ( iwasawa et al . 2000 ; shih et al .",
    "we anyway note that this is not a critical point , since the hr evolution is only used to select the appropriate intervals for the subsequent time - resolved spectral analysis , which is crucial to validate or dismiss the suggested interpretation .",
    "+ the shape of the hr light curve reveals two periods of sudden spectral hardening around @xmath025 and 90  ks ; this hints at increased opacity , which would mainly affect the 25  kev band . according to fig .",
    "[ lc ] , six different regimes of the hardness ratio can be roughly defined . in this framework",
    ", the minor hr fluctuations on very short time - scales can be due to a flickering of the photon index in response to variations of the physical conditions in the disc / corona system , but the statistics is not enough for a complete investigation of these aspects .",
    "regardless of this , our aim is to check whether a reasonable configuration of the neutral absorber allows us to recover a steeper intrinsic photon index for the x - ray emission of ngc  4395 .",
    "+ in order to obtain an adequate description of the entire 0.510  kev spectral range , we included in the reference model above also an apec component for the soft thermal emission ( smith et al .",
    "2001 ) and a two - zone warm absorber , whose complex effects have been already pointed out in several previous works ( see also dewangan et al .",
    "2008 ) . in our analysis",
    "we have assumed that the soft emission , warm absorption and reflection features do not vary in the course of a @xmath0100  ks long observation : since the light crossing time over a distance of a gravitational radius ( @xmath23 ) is of the order of one second , the reflection component is expected to change significantly in response to the primary continuum only if the scattering material is located well within @xmath010@xmath24 from the centre ( as in the disc reflection scenarios ; e.g. nardini et al . 2011 ) . similarly , the soft emission likely arises from a very extended region , while the warm absorber , in principle , could lie much closer to the x - ray source ( but see blustin et al .",
    "2005 ) : if this is the case , we are just sampling its average properties . on the other hand , @xmath25 , @xmath22 and @xmath26",
    "were initially left free to evolve among the different intervals .",
    "( 1 ) or @xmath22(2 ) , and plotted respectively in red , green and blue.,width=321 ]    in spite of the possible degeneracies , it turns out that the photon index and the column density are subject to very limited variations : in particular , @xmath27 .",
    "this suggests that @xmath25 and @xmath22 can be roughly treated as constant parameters as well , hence their values have been tied in all the six spectra : only the covering fraction of the cold absorber is allowed to vary with time .",
    "+ on sheer statistical grounds , this model already gives a very good fit ( @xmath28 , with @xmath29 and @xmath30  @xmath5 ) , proving that , in first approximation , @xmath26 alone would be able to account for all the observed spectral variability : its qualitative trend across the six intervals , in fact , fairly correlates with the shape of the hr light curve .",
    "there are some problems with the reflection efficiency , though .",
    "it is not obvious how to assess the latter quantity in the time - resolved analysis , anyway by comparing the pexrav amplitude to the highest flux level of the power - law continuum we obtain a reflection strength of @xmath31 , which is completely inconsistent with the moderate equivalent width of the companion iron line ( george & fabian 1991 ) .",
    "moreover , when extrapolated at higher energies , such component would give rise to a very flat spectrum with a prominent compton hump at @xmath030  kev , which is not detected by _ swift_/bat . given that the time - scales are extremely different , it is still possible that the source is caught in a state of large reflection during the _ xmm - newton _ observation , but in this case the fluorescent iron line should be much stronger as well . forcing @xmath32 to have a standard value delivers a poor spectral description , and no improvement is achieved through the self - consistent reflionx table models ( ross & fabian 2005 ) .",
    "+ as a consequence , we attempted to introduce a second partial covering cold absorber , assuming again that @xmath25 and @xmath22(1,2 ) are constant , and @xmath26(1,2 ) variable . the best fit quality",
    "is significantly improved ( @xmath33 ) , while the photon index @xmath34 is still in excellent agreement with the average high - energy slope of the source .",
    "the presence of an additional absorber with column density of @xmath010@xmath4  @xmath5 removes all the previous limitations , reducing substantially the required strength of the reflection continuum ( now @xmath35 ) .",
    "this is also clear from fig .",
    "[ sc ] , where the different model components are disentangled to display their relative contribution in a single time segment .",
    "the basic parameters of this final model are listed in table  [ t1 ] , while the six individual spectra are shown in fig .",

    "the data are rebinned for plotting purposes only.,width=321 ]    .main parameters of the _ xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku _ best - fitting models , common to all the intervals on which our time - resolved spectral analysis has been performed .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the cold absorption model provides a good interpretation of the spectral variability of the x - ray source during both the _ xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku _ observations .",
    "moreover , considering the entries of table  [ t1 ] , the basic physical quantities appear to be in fair agreement .",
    "this is a strong confirmation of the validity of the scenario explored in this work , where the changes are driven by the evolution of the covering fractions .",
    "the @xmath26(1 ) and @xmath26(2 ) progression is listed in table  [ t2 ] . due to the smaller uncertainties ,",
    "we focus our discussion on the _ xmm - newton _ case .",
    "we first point out that our model is defined in such a way that mutually exclusive regions of the x - ray source are affected by the two cold absorbers : in other words , we only consider a single - layer configuration of the neutral gas along the line of sight .",
    "all the @xmath26 sequences should be taken with some caution , though . the low ionization stage in one of the warm absorption component impairs to some extent the determination of @xmath26(1 ) , while possible changes in the reflection strength on that of @xmath26(2 ) . however , even from the face values obtained under our assumptions , some interesting considerations can be drawn .",
    "it is now @xmath42 that shows a tighter correlation with the hr light curve : the peaks during periods 2 and 5 might be explained in terms of _ eclipses _ from individual _ clouds _ ( e.g. lamer , uttley & mchardy 2003 ; risaliti et al .",
    "given that the duration of such events is @xmath010  ks , a typical dimension of the x - ray source of @xmath010@xmath43 corresponds to a transverse velocity of the putative clouds of @xmath010@xmath7  km s@xmath8 , placing the obscuring gas at the broad - line region scale .",
    "the size and the shape of these blobs are not precisely known . yet",
    ", our time - resolved analysis suggests that different column densities are present along the line of sight at the same time .",
    "the range of variations in @xmath26 implies that the number of intervening clouds is very limited ( a few at most , see fig  [ blr ] ) , and that their size is comparable to the dimensions of the x - ray source . the extreme case entails a single irregular and inhomogeneous absorber . + the physical situation is then expected to be rather complex . in this view , the x - ray absorbers that we have included should be only regarded as a linear combination of the _ real _ ones , whose exact geometrical structure can not be probed with the present data quality . the large disparity ( roughly an order of magnitude ) between the column densities involved , and specifically the fact that @xmath44 , hints at a multi - layer configuration of the cold absorber , where the two phases have a different location and",
    "are superimposed in part on one another when seen in projection .",
    "such a scheme can be envisaged as in fig .",
    "[ abs ] : only the broad - line region component , with @xmath45  @xmath5 , has a time - dependent covering fraction ( @xmath460.8 ) .",
    "conversely , the absorption system with lower column density is constant ( or at least variable over much longer scales ) , and can be associated with a more distant gaseous component , within a narrow - line or torus - like region .",
    "indeed , this would be consistent with both the optical classification of ngc  4395 as a type 1.51.8 seyfert galaxy ( ho et al . 1997 ; panessa et al .",
    "2006 ) and the large covering factor of the emission - line regions with respect to the central source ( kraemer et al .",
    "the broad- and narrow - line regions are expected to be responsible for some of the uv to x - ray absorption detected in ngc  4395 ( crenshaw et al .",
    "2004 ) , and evidence for the identification of the rapidly variable x - ray absorber with the broad - line emitting clouds have been recently found in other seyfert galaxies ( e.g. maiolino et al .",
    "2010 ; risaliti et al .",
    "2011 ) . in this perspective ,",
    "the frequency and amplitude of the variations in @xmath22 and/or @xmath26 would be linked to the degree of clumpiness of the circumnuclear environment at the different scales .",
    "+ once the _ suzaku _ data are taken into account , all the considerations made above still hold , even though the uncertainties on the key parameters are quite large , and the smaller difference between @xmath22(1 ) and @xmath22(2 ) makes the covering fraction patterns less meaningful . apart from the speculations on the physical and geometrical structure of the cold absorption system , the scenario outlined in this work has the other great advantage of strengthening the correlation between ngc  4395 and the high - luminosity agn population .",
    "first , it gives reasons for the x - ray spectral hardness of this source , reconciling the estimate of its photon index with the typical values found among agn ; secondly , neutral absorption variability systematically occurs in a significant fraction of active galaxies , the prototypical case being another type 1.8 seyfert , ngc  1365 ( e.g. risaliti et al .",
    "our findings then represent a further point of contact between ngc  4395 and its more massive and luminous counterparts .",
    "incidentally , it is also worth noting that the intrinsic 0.510  kev emission of ngc  4395 implied in this cold absorption scheme is larger than the observed one by just a factor of @xmath02 ( table  [ t1 ] ) .",
    "taking advantage of the _ swift_/bat spectral constraints , the resulting 0.5100  kev luminosity is @xmath06@xmath47  erg s@xmath8 , which exceeds the usual estimates of the bolometric luminosity ( see also moran et al . 2005 ; iwasawa et al .",
    "depending of the exact value of the black hole mass , the eddington ratio of ngc  4395 could be much closer to @xmath00.01 than previously thought .    .",
    "the number of clouds simultaneously crossing the line of sight and their size are limited by the rapid changes of @xmath26 .",
    "even a single blob with irregular shape and non - uniform physical properties is consistent with the observed variability pattern .",
    "( the observer is located towards the bottom of the page).,width=321 ]    , but an alternative configuration is assumed : the absorption component with lower column density has a constant covering fraction of @xmath48 and is external to the system of clouds responsible of the x - ray spectral variability ( see the discussion in the text).,width=321 ]",
    "we have discussed a possible interpretation of the x - ray spectral hardness usually observed in the low - luminosity active galaxy ngc  4395 .",
    "this source harbours in its centre a black hole with estimated mass of @xmath010@xmath1 , and it is one of the few known objects whose study can shed light on the links between the physics of accretion processes in galactic black hole binaries and agn . in spite of being a genuine seyfert galaxy in many respects , ngc",
    "4395 remains a somewhat puzzling source because of the inferred flatness of its primary x - ray continuum .",
    "the existence of complex absorption effects has often been proposed as a likely explanation .",
    "here we have provided for the first time an example of these effects based on observational evidence , by reviewing the two highest - quality looks of ngc  4395 taken by _",
    "xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku _ : in both cases , a time - resolved analysis shows that the spectral evolution of the source can be interpreted by means of a two - phase neutral absorber with variable covering factor . as a first approximation ,",
    "this cold absorber is identified with the system of broad - line clouds , allowing for a double - peaked @xmath22 distribution .",
    "the low column density component can otherwise be attributed to an external narrow - line or torus - like region , with nearly constant @xmath26 .",
    "this is presumably an oversimplification of the physical and geometrical structure of the circumnuclear environment ( which is known to comprise also a complex , multi - zone warm absorber ) , but even the existence of a single partial - covering cold screen can not be completely ruled out on statistical grounds .",
    "+ we stress that the absorption variability scenario presented here is not unique , and different models based on intrinsically flat x - ray continua ( with significant changes of either the photon index or the reflection strength ) can describe the observed behaviour of this source equally well . this interpretation",
    ", however , fits into the analogy between the properties of ngc  4395 and those of _ standard _",
    "high - luminosity seyfert galaxies , many of which are systematically affected by x - ray absorption variability due to the clumpiness of their circumnuclear regions .",
    "moreover , it allows us to retrieve in a natural way a @xmath49 photon index below 10  kev , in perfect agreement with the _ swift_/bat spectral slope and the usual values measured among agn .",
    "no alternative explanation would then be required for the intrinsic 210  kev flatness of ngc  4395 .",
