    "since its discovery in 1975 @xcite , the be / x - ray binary 1a 0535 + 262 has been intensely studied .",
    "further details may be found in a review by @xcite .",
    "the source has shown giant outbursts in april / may 1975 @xcite , october 1980 @xcite , march / april 1989 @xcite , february 1994 @xcite , and in may / june 2005 @xcite .",
    "then the source showed a normal outburst in august / september 2005 , observed by _ integral _ and _ rxte _ . during this outbusrt ,",
    "the averge flux was 300 mcrab in the energy range 5 - 100 kev @xcite .",
    "the last normal outburst took place in december 2005 @xcite .",
    "[ fig : asm_lc ] shows the _ rxte _ _ asm _ long term light curve of the source during the last three outbursts . in this paper",
    ", we present preliminary results on the timing and spectral behaviour of the source based on _ integral _ _ ibis ( isgri ) _ data from the august / september 2005 outburst .",
    "all data were reduced and analysed using _ integral _ osa v5.1 .",
    "pulse phase resolved spectroscopy was performed using additionally the software provided by iasf / inaf palermo .    ]",
    "using epoch folding techniques , we calculated the pulse period of the source , after applying barycentric correction and a correction for the binary orbit .",
    "the orbital parameters were taken from @xcite and @xcite . in order to find a @xmath0 , we divided the observation into 27 intervals of @xmath1 6ks each .",
    "we folded the light curve of each of those intervals over the period obtained from epoch folding , and checked that the pulse profiles obtained are shifted by an integer number of periods .",
    "we find a constant period of p=103.3920 @xmath2 0.0004s for mjd 53613.460475 . for comparison , in fig .",
    "[ fig : period_history ] we plot the pulse period history of the source since its first determination in 1975 . using the above pulse period obtained , we folded the light curves for _ ibis ( isgri ) _ data in different energy ranges .",
    "the resulting pulse profiles are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ibis_pp ] .",
    "two pulse phases are shown for clarity .",
    "a double peak pattern is seen up to at least 60kev , while at higher energies one of the peaks appears to be strongly reduced .",
    "the source is observed to pulsate up to @xmath3  kev .",
    "it is evident form fig .",

    "we extracted the phase average spectra for _ ibis ( isgri ) _ . to model the continuum we use a powerlaw with a high energy cutoff ( _ xspec _  highecut ) , freezing the photon index to @xmath4 and the cutoff energy to @xmath5  kev ( theses values , typical for accreting pulsars ,",
    "were taken from the literature , see @xcite ) . when fitting this continuum we detected two absorption like features in the residuals , that we interpret as cyclotron resonance scattering features .",
    "we modeled those features using gaussian lines in absorption @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 obtained for a fit without absoprtion lines is 32.14 for 132 d.o.f .",
    "including one gaussian absorption line at @xmath7kev the @xmath6 improves to 3.315 for 129 d.o.f . by including two gaussian absoprtion lines at @xmath7kev and @xmath8kev ,",
    "the @xmath6 further reduces to 1.7 for 126 d.o.f .",
    "we therefore included in our model two absorption lines ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : phase_average ] ) .",
    "the best fit parameters for the lines are listed in table  [ tab : table1 ] .",

    "in this poster we show some first results of our analysis of the _ integral _ 1a 0535 + 262 data from the august / september 2005 outburst .",
    "the source is found to pulsate up to 120 kev and energy dependent pulse profiles are observed .",
    "we also detect the presence of two phase dependent cyclotron lines at @xmath1  45  kev and @xmath1  100  kev in the hard x - ray spectrum of the source . this therefore confirms previous results by kendziorra et al .",

    "data taken during the march / april 1989 giant outburst .",
    "we wish to outline however that observation from _ osse _   on _ cgro _  during the february 1994 giant outburst clearly detected only the 110 kev line .",
    "the presence of the fundamental line was not clear , but it was concluded that if the line was present , its optical depth should be significantly smaller than that of the 110 kev line @xcite . based on our results we can estimate from the fundamental line at @xmath7  kev the magnetic field of the source to be @xmath12  x@xmath13  g. further detailed analysis of this outburst is ongoing . the next step will be to try different models for fitting the broad band continuum making use of observational data from _ jem - x _  and _",
