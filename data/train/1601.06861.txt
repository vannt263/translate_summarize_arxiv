    "the problem of characterizing the class of all interpolation spaces for a given couple of compatible banach spaces is one of the fundamental problems in interpolation theory .",
    "although there are many constructions used to generate interpolation spaces , it can be very difficult to show that all interpolation spaces have been generated .",
    "for the couple @xmath2 , however , the problem has been completely solved .",
    "mityagin @xcite in 1965 and , independently , caldern @xcite in 1966 gave characterizations of the class of all interpolation spaces with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "this discovery was an important point in the study of abstract interpolation spaces .",
    "couples for which a similar characterization exists are called caldern - mityagin couples . while the benefits are great , the problem of determining whether or not a given banach couple is a caldern - mityagin couple is still a difficult one in general . nonetheless , many caldern - mityagin couples have been discovered ; we refer to papers @xcite and @xcite and references therein related to this topic .",
    "we concern ourselves here with two couples closely related to @xmath2 .",
    "they are based on a pair of dual constructions , the least decreasing majorant and the level function , which arise naturally when monotone functions are involved and have been used to solve a variety of problems in the theory of function spaces and norm inequalities .",
    "for example , they were applied to describe the dual of the classical lorentz spaces in @xcite and to give weight conditions for the boundedness of the hardy operator in @xcite .",
    "they have also been used to study absolute convergence of fourier series , by beurling in @xcite and more recently in @xcite .",
    "see the references in @xcite for additional applications .",
    "spaces defined in terms of the least decreasing majorant construction form a class of subspaces of the interpolation spaces for @xmath2 , while spaces defined in terms of the level function construction form a class of superspaces of the interpolation spaces for @xmath2 .",
    "we will show that the parallels between these three classes of function spaces are very strong .",
    "specifically , we show that a couple of interpolation spaces from one class is a caldern - mityagin couple if and only if the corresponding couple in either of the other two classes is also a caldern - mityagin couple .",
    "the _ least decreasing majorant _ of a lebesgue measurable function @xmath3 on @xmath4 , is defined by , @xmath5 the map @xmath6 is sublinear , that is , @xmath7 . for any @xmath3 , @xmath8 is non - negative and decreasing , @xmath9 almost everywhere , and @xmath8 is minimal among functions with these two properties . in consequence ,",

    "sublinearity makes it routine to verify that @xmath13 is a banach function space .",
    "the level function of @xmath3 , denoted @xmath16 , is a closely related projection defined ( almost everywhere ) to be the derivative of the least concave majorant of @xmath17 , provided it is finite .",
    "results of @xcite show that that if @xmath18 then @xmath19 ; this property is used to define @xmath16 in the event that the least concave majorant of @xmath17 is infinite for some @xmath20 . for any @xmath3 ,",
