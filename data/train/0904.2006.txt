    "the importance of agn outflows for cosmic structure formation and evolution has been widely appreciated recently .",
    "agn outflows may simultaneously explain the antihierarchical quenching of star formation in massive galaxies , the exponential cut - off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) , the @xmath6 relation and the quenching of cooling - flows in cluster cores ( e.g. , scannapieco et al . 2005 ; begelman & nath 2005 ; croton et al .",
    "2006 ; best et al .",
    "outflows from radio agn are especially important locally because nearly all strong radio agn are hosted by early - type galaxies that dominate the high end of the lf and the galaxy population in clusters .",
    "radio agn are different from emission - line agn selected in optical surveys .",
    "kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2004 ) showed that optical emission - line agn favor low - density environments and are mainly produced by bhs with masses below 10@xmath7 m@xmath8 . on the other hand , radio - loud agn favor denser environments than do normal galaxies , and",
    "the integrated radio luminosity density comes from the most massive bhs ( best et al .",
    "best et al .",
    "( 2005 ) also showed that the fraction of galaxies that are radio agn increases with the stellar or bh mass ( as @xmath9 or @xmath10 ) , while shabala et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found a similar relation as @xmath11 or @xmath12 .",
    "the analysis by best et al . indicates no correlation between radio and optical emission - line luminosities for radio agn , and the probability that a galaxy of given mass is radio loud is independent of whether it is an optical agn .",
    "these results drove best et al .",
    "( 2005 ) to suggest that low - luminosity radio agn ( fr i or fainter ) form a distinctly different group from optical emission - line agn .",
    "they suggested that the radio agn activity is associated with cooling of gas from the hot halos surrounding elliptical galaxies and clusters ( see also hardcastle et al .",
    "a similar idea has been proposed by croton et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . besides the classical `` quasar mode '' in agn feedback",
    ", they introduced a `` radio mode '' which is the result of the x - ray gas accretion on to the central bhs .",
    "the inclusion of this `` radio mode '' in their simulations allows suppression of both excessive cooling and growing of very massive galaxies",
    ". it also explains why most massive galaxies are red bulge - dominated systems containing old stars .",
    "radio activity of galaxies is enhanced in clusters and the distribution of cluster radio agn is highly concentrated ( e.g. , lin & mohr 2007 ; best et al .",
    "2007 ) . among all cluster galaxies , the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) is generally the most massive galaxy and has the biggest impact on the surrounding large cool core and the general icm properties . with the sdss c4 cluster sample , best et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found that bcgs are more likely to host a radio agn than other galaxies of the same stellar or bh mass ( see also lin & mohr 2007 ) .",
    "this difference implies that either bcgs stay in each radio active cycle for a longer time , or they are more frequently re - triggered than non - bcgs . the mutual interaction between radio agn ( especially those of bcgs ) and the surrounding",
    "icm has a significant impact on both of them .",
    "the great power of jets from radio agn can not only quench cooling in cluster cool cores , but also can drive the icm properties away from those defined by simple self - similar relations involving only gravity ( summarized in voit 2005 ) .",
    "the icm around the radio agn provides a historical chronicle of the smbh activity .",
    "x - ray cavities and shocks serve as calorimeters for the total energy outputs of agn that allow us to understand a great deal of agn feedback and smbh growth ( summarized by mcnamara & nulsen 2007 ) . on the other hand , radio agn ( fr - i or fainter ) may need an enhanced x - ray atmosphere to fuel them .",
    "churazov et al .",
    "( 2005 ) used galactic x - ray binaries as analogue for the different evolution states of the smbh , from radiative efficient mode with weak outflows ( quasars ) to radiative inefficient mode with strong outflows ( local giant ellipticals ) .",
    "the smbhs of local giant ellipticals have very low accretion rates and radiative efficiencies , but are very efficient to heat the surrounding gas .",
    "allen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) presented a tight correlation between the bondi accretion rate and the mechanical power of radio agn for bcgs in 9 groups and clusters .",
    "the relation implies that 1% - 4% of mass energy of the gas accreted through bondi accretion is transferred to the feedback energy to heat the surrounding icm .",
    "hardcastle et al . (",
    "2007 ) further suggested that accretion of hot gas is sufficient to power all low - excitation radio agn ( fr - i and some fr - ii ) , while the high - excitation fr - ii agn are powered by accretion of cold gas .    as @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is entropy of the surrounding gas defined as @xmath15 ) , strong radio agn require low - entropy circum - nuclear gas and massive black holes .",
    "although many groups and clusters have large and dense cool cores ( e.g. , @xmath4 50% in the hiflugcs sample , chen et al .",
    "2007 ) , most cluster galaxies ( including many bcgs ) are not located in such large cool cores .",
    "their surrounding icm has too high an entropy ( @xmath16 50 times the value at the center of cluster cool cores ) to trigger any significant nuclear activity .",
    "thus , the emerging significant questions are : _ what fuels the strong radio agn in groups and clusters , especially those not in large cool cores ? is an x - ray cool core always required for strong radio agn in groups and clusters ? is the sufficient hot gas supply the reason that bcgs stay in the radio active phase longer ? _ the work mentioned in the last two paragraphs only discussed optical and radio data of radio agn .  and",
    "allow detailed studies of the x - ray atmosphere around radio agn in groups and clusters .",
    "small x - ray thermal halos around the nuclei of strong radio agn are often found ( e.g. , hardcastle et al .",
    "2001 on 3c  66b ; hardcastle et al .",
    "2002 on 3c  31 ; worrall et al . 2003 on ngc  315 ; hardcastle et al .",

    "2005b on ngc  1265 ; evans et al .",
    "2006 on a sample of fr - i and fr - ii galaxies ) .",
    "hardcastle et al . (",
    "2007 ) also summarized some recent  and results for the hot gas atmosphere of nearby radio galaxies but the sample with detailed studies is small and those radio agn are mainly in groups .    with different original motivations , sun et al .",
    "( 2007 , s07 hereafter ) presented a systematic analysis of x - ray thermal coronae of early - type galaxies in 25 hot ( @xmath173 kev ) , nearby ( @xmath180.05 ) clusters , based on  archival data .",
    "small and cool galactic coronae ( @xmath19 4 kpc in radius and @xmath20=0.5 - 1.1 kev generally ) have been found to be common , @xmath21% in @xmath222 @xmath23 galaxies .",
    "although much smaller and fainter than the classical cluster cool cores like those in perseus , virgo and a478 , they are in fact mini - versions of large cool cores ( with cooling time of 10 myr - 1 gyr from the center to the boundary ) , composed of the ism gas ( from the stellar mass loss ) pressure confined by the surrounding icm .",
    "these small coronae managed to survive strong icm stripping , evaporation , rapid cooling , and powerful agn outflows ( see s07 for detailed discussions ) .",
    "one interesting result noticed by s07 is the connection between strong radio agn and small coronae ( section 4.4 of s07 ) .",
    "however , the s07 sample size is small ( 9 galaxies with @xmath24 w hz@xmath1 ) and only small coronae were discussed .",
    "sun et al .",
    "( 2009 , s09 hereafter ) added six more examples of bcg coronae with strong radio agn but the combined sample with s07 is still small .",
    "the questions raised early need to be addressed with a bigger sample . in this work ,",
    "we present results on such a sample from the  archive ( 186 galaxies from 152 groups and clusters , including all bcgs , 74 galaxies with @xmath24 w hz@xmath1 ) .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : the galaxy sample is defined in section 2 .",
    "the data analysis is presented in section 3 , as well as the definition of cool cores in this work . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the x - ray gas atmosphere of bcgs and non - bcgs with luminous radio agn from the sample study . after learning the general properties of the sample",
    ", we present a detailed analysis of a luminous corona associated with a strong radio agn in section 5 ( ) .",
    "many  data are shallow so only upper limits of coronal emission exist in some cases . in section 6 , we discuss the the faintest corona known that sheds light on the properties of faint embedded coronae .",
    "discussions are in section 7 and section 8 contains the conclusions .",
    "we assumed h@xmath25 = 71 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 , @xmath26@xmath27=0.27 , and @xmath28=0.73 .",
    "we want to examine the x - ray gas component associated with bcgs and other strong radio agn , either large cool cores or small coronae .",
    "the typically small luminosity of a corona ( @xmath29 ergs s@xmath1 in the 0.5 - 2 kev band ) limits our studies to local systems .",
    "s07 only studied @xmath30 kev clusters at @xmath31 . in this work",
    ", we include any observations of @xmath32 groups and clusters with an exposure of longer than 5 ks .",
    "we also include higher redshift systems with sufficient  data , but with a hard limit of @xmath33 .",
    "as we want to cover more volume in a single group or cluster , we limit our sample to @xmath34 systems .",
    "there are very few strong radio agn in @xmath35 groups and clusters anyway .",
    "the group and cluster sample is collected from the  archive .",
    "two x - ray flux - limited samples , b55 ( peres et al .",
    "1998 ) and hiflugcs ( reiprich & b@xmath36hringer 2002 ) , are almost 100% covered by",
    ". however , both samples are not big and have few or no groups . as less than 1/3 of the reflex and noras clusters ( b@xmath36hringer et al .",
    "2000 ; b@xmath36hringer et al .",
    "2004 ) have data , we are forced to include as many systems from the archive as we can .",
    "the final sample includes 152 groups and clusters ( table 1 ) .",
    "most conclusions of this work should not be much affected by the heterogeneous nature of the cluster sample .",
    "we will also discuss the b55 and the extended hiflugcs samples in section 7.4 .",
    "our main goal is to examine the x - ray gas atmosphere around bcgs so all bcgs are included in the galaxy sample .",
    "the bcg is defined as the most luminous galaxy in the 2mass @xmath37 band within 0.1 @xmath38 of the group or cluster . in relaxed groups and clusters ,",
    "the selection of bcgs is easy . in nine unrelaxed groups and clusters , two bcgs with comparable @xmath37-band luminosities",
    "are selected , including coma , a2147 , a1367 , a1142 , a3128 , rxc j1022.0 + 3830 , sc1329 - 313 , a1275 and a2384 .",
    "therefore , the bcg sample includes 161 galaxies .",
    "we also want to include all galaxies with a 1.4 ghz luminosity higher than @xmath39 w hz@xmath1 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "a radio spectral index of -0.8 is assumed in the small radio @xmath14-correction .",
    "this @xmath40 is about 1/3 of the @xmath41 of the radio luminosity function ( best et al .",
    "2005 ) and is comparable to the luminosities of many nearby 3c or pks radio galaxies . for comparison , the central radio galaxy of the centaurus cluster ( ngc  4696 , pks  1245 - 41 ) has an @xmath42 of 0.60@xmath43 w hz@xmath1 . the giant radio galaxy in our backyard , centaurus a , has an @xmath42 of 0.46@xmath43 w hz@xmath1.the chosen @xmath40 corresponds to an average mechanical power of @xmath44 ergs s@xmath1 ( but with large scatter , brzan et al .",
    "2008 ) , which is capable of increasing the thermal energy of a 10@xmath45 m@xmath8 gas core ( typical for the cool cores of luminous groups and poor clusters ) at @xmath20=1 kev by @xmath4 40% in 100 myr . for a small corona with a total gas mass of @xmath46 m@xmath8 ( s07 ) , this kind of radio outbursts will easily destroy the whole corona if only @xmath4 1% of the total mechanical power is deposited within the corona for 10@xmath7 yr .",
    "the radio fluxes come from the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) ( condon et al .",
    "1998 ) and the sydney university molonglo sky survey ( sumss ) ( bock , large & sadler 1999 ) .",
    "we also examine the higher resolution images from the faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimeters ( first ) survey ( becker , white & helfand 1995 ) and literature if available .",
    "the origins of radio sources can be determined in all cases .",
    "because of the proximity , spectroscopic redshifts are available for all radio galaxies in our sample .",
    "we generally use the system redshift ( table 1 ) to calculate distance . for the centaurus cluster and the ngc  7619 group , we used their surface - brightness - fluctuation distance from tonry et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "radio agn are over - represented in our bcg sample .",
    "there are 50% of bcgs ( 81 out of 161 ) with @xmath47 w hz@xmath1 and 32% of bcgs ( 52 out of 161 ) with @xmath24 w hz@xmath1 .",
    "lin & mohr ( 2007 ) derived the radio active fractions of bcgs for 573 groups and clusters selected from the noras and reflex cluster catalogs .",
    "their fractions at these two thresholds are 33% and 20% respectively .",
    "von der linden et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and best et al .",
    "( 2007 ) examined a sample of 1106 groups and clusters optically selected from sdss .",
    "the radio active fraction of bcgs is @xmath4 30% at @xmath47 w hz@xmath1 , for the typical stellar mass of bcgs in our sample .",
    "this fact again demonstrates the heterogeneous nature of our sample , which should be kept in mind when our results are interpreted .",
    "in fact , radio agn are also over - represented in the b55 sample and the extended hiflugcs sample ( section 7.4 ) .",
    "the radio agn fractions of bcgs in these two samples are similar to ours , @xmath4 50% for @xmath47 w hz@xmath1 agn and @xmath4 30% for @xmath24 w hz@xmath1 agn .",
    "as x - ray flux - limited samples , the over - abundance of radio agn of bcgs in both samples is mainly caused by the prevalence of large cool core clusters in both samples , as strong radio agn are more likely to be associated with luminous cool core clusters ( see section 4 ) .",
    "all observations were performed with the  advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) .",
    "standard data analysis was performed which includes the corrections for the slow gain change and charge transfer inefficiency ( for both the fi and bi chips ) .",
    "we investigated the light curve of source - free regions ( or regions with a small fraction of the source emission ) to identify and exclude time intervals with strong particle background flares .",
    "we corrected for the acis low - energy quantum efficiency ( qe ) degradation due to the contamination on acis s optical blocking filter , which increases with time and is positionally dependent .",
    "the dead area effect on the fi chips , caused by cosmic rays , has also been corrected .",
    "we used ciao3.4 for the data analysis .",
    "the calibration files used correspond to  calibration database ( caldb ) 3.5.2 from the  x - ray center . in the spectral analysis , a lower energy cut of 0.4 kev is used to minimize the effects of calibration uncertainties at low energy .",
    "the solar photospheric abundance table by anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) is used in the spectral fits . in the spectral analysis ,",
    "cash statistics is used for faint sources .",
    "uncertainties quoted in this paper are 1 @xmath48 .",
    "special data analysis related to  is discussed in section 5.1 .    in this work ,",
    "x - ray cool cores include both large cool cores and small coronae .",
    "how do we define a large cool core ?",
    "a core is considered as a large cool core if its central isochoric cooling time is less than 2 gyr .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of a large cool core is measured within a radius where the gas isochoric cooling time is 4 gyr ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the cooling time profiles come from s09 , cavagnolo et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and our own work .",
    "note that @xmath49 effectively means the whole region for small coronae ( s07 and section 5 ) .",
    "reasons behind these thresholds of cooling time are as follows .",
    "first , there are systems with central cooling time between 1 gyr and 10 gyr , or weak - cool - core clusters ( e.g. , mittal et al .",
    "2009 ; pratt et al . 2009 ; cavagnolo et al .",
    "some weak cool cores also have a bcg corona , e.g. , a3558 with an icm central cooling time of @xmath4 4 gyr ( s07 ) , a1060 with an icm central cooling time of @xmath4 3.6 gyr ( yamasaki et al . 2002 ) and a2589 with an icm central cooling time of @xmath4 2.5 gyr beyond the central source ( this work ) .",
    "we want to select a cut of the central cooling time that excludes these sources so 2 gyr is chosen .",
    "systems with central cooling time of @xmath50 1 gyr are usually considered as strong cool cores ( e.g. , mittal et al . 2009 ; pratt et al .",
    "our threshold of 2 gyr includes some weak cool cores , but not many .",
    "there are seven clusters in this sample with a central cooling time of 1 - 2 gyr , a3571 , a2244 , a2063 , a2142 , a4038 , a1650 and a2384 ( north ) .",
    "none of them has a bcg corona ( likely already merged with the large icm cool core ) and their radio agn are always faint ( @xmath51 w hz@xmath1 ) .",
    "thus , all large cool cores with @xmath52 w hz@xmath1 in this work are strong cool cores with a central cooling time of @xmath19 1 gyr ( see section 4 ) .",
    "second , we want these two thresholds not too close to reflect the still high luminosities of the weak cool cores , but also not too far to have many systems fall between two thresholds . thus , 4 gyr is chosen as the aperture for the luminosity measurement .",
    "a somewhat different cooling time ( 3 - 5 gyr ) does not affect any conclusions of this work .",
    "there are seven systems in this `` grey '' area with a central cooling time of 2 - 4 gyr , including a2589 , a2657 , a3558 , a1060 , as405 , a3266 and a3562 . based on our definition",
    ", they are not large cool cores so any cool cores associated with their bcgs can only be small coronae , which indeed is the case for some of them ( a3558 , a1060 and a2589 ) .",
    "as405 has the most luminous radio agn in this group with a @xmath42 of 1.65@xmath0 w hz@xmath1 , while the radio agn with other bcgs are all fainter than 3@xmath53 w hz@xmath1 .",
    "as our focus is on bcgs with strong radio agn , the exact classification of these systems in the `` grey '' area have little impact on our conclusions .",
    "in fact , we can conclude that weak cool cores do not have strong radio agn , unless a corona is present .",
    "section 3 of s07 detailed the analysis on the identification of faint thermal sources .",
    "we always perform a spectral analysis .",
    "most sources studied in this work have sufficient counts for a detailed spectral analysis .",
    "however , there are faint sources ( e.g. , with less than 100 counts in the 0.5 - 2 kev band ) so the significance of the iron l - shell hump or the `` softness '' of the spectrum needs to be tested ( see section 3 of s07 ) .",
    "we used the s07 method with monte - carlo simulations ( section 3.1 of s07 ) to address the significance of the iron l - shell hump . only sources with an iron l - shell hump that is more significant at @xmath16 99.5% level are considered thermal coronae .",
    "for faint sources that do not meet the above criteria , we further identified `` soft x - ray sources '' with a power law fit as defined in section 3.2 of s07 .",
    "the power law index method is similar to the 1.5 - 7 kev / 0.5 - 1.5 kev hardness ratio method , as coronae should have strong excess emission above the continuum in the 0.5 - 1.5 kev band . as argued in s07",
    ", most `` soft x - ray sources '' identified by the power law index method should be genuine coronae .",
    "in fact , after the s07 work , deeper  data for a3627 and a2052 had been available .",
    "the data cover three sources identified as `` soft x - ray sources '' by s07 , eso  137 - 008 in a3627 , cgcg  049 - 092 and pgc  093473 in a2052 ( table 2 of s07 ) .",
    "the deeper data clearly reveal a significant iron l - shell hump in each spectrum and confirm the corona nature for all of them .",
    "this work identified 73 small coronae .",
    "only seven of them are flagged as `` soft x - ray sources '' that are not as robust as others ( five in table 2 ) .",
    "thus , this uncertainty has little impact on the conclusions of this work . for sources",
    "not identified as coronae or `` soft x - ray sources '' , upper limits on the thermal emission are given , with the method listed in s07 .",
    "we emphasize that the number of coronae determined in this work is only a lower limit , as  exposures are not optimized for studies of faint galactic emission .",
    "as shown in section 6 , the faintest embedded corona known has an x - ray luminosity much lower than any upper limits in this work .",
    "about 2/3 of galaxies only with upper limits of coronal emission are detected in x - rays .",
    "they are either very faint sources or very bright x - ray agn that makes the identification of thermal emission difficult .",
    "ngc  3862 ( or 3c  264 ) in a1367 is a good example ( s07 , also in table 2 ) .",
    "if not for an on - axis sub - array observation , the weak thermal emission of its corona can not be confirmed only from the spectral analysis .",
    "different from s07 , we also did not use any stacking and always studied the spectrum of a single galaxy .",
    "thus , the identification of thermal coronae in this work was conservative .",
    "the main cool - core property we measured is the 0.5 - 2 kev luminosity .",
    "this energy band is where the thermal emission of a corona is significant , even if a strong x - ray agn is present . for large cool cores ,",
    "the luminosity is derived from the spectral fit to the total spectrum within @xmath49 .",
    "multi-@xmath20 components are often required for bright cores . for coronae",
    ", the immediate local background was always used .",
    "a power - law component was always included in the spectral fits to account for the nuclear and lmxb emission .",
    "the gas abundance can not be constrained for faint coronae so it was fixed at 0.8 solar as derived by s07 .",
    "the derived typical abundance for bright coronae is also consistent with this assumed value ( e.g. , see section 5.3 for ) . for faint coronae , the uncertainty of the x - ray luminosity mainly comes from the statistical error .",
    "the uncertainty of the non - thermal component does not affect the 0.5 - 2 kev luminosity much , as the identified faint coronae have dominant thermal emission in the soft band .",
    "faint sources with a hard spectrum will not be identified as coronae as stated previously in this section .",
    "we first examine bcgs in the @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) - @xmath42 plane ( fig .",
    "1 ) . bcgs in groups ( @xmath56 2 kev ) , poor clusters ( 2 kev @xmath57 4 kev ) and rich clusters ( @xmath58 4 kev ) are color - coded .",
    "the system temperatures come from bax , s09 , cavagnolo et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and our own work . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , almost all cool cores ( including upper limits ) can be divided into two classes , marked by a vertical ellipse for small coronae and a tilted ellipse for large cool cores .",
    "the dividing line between the two classes is @xmath59 ergs s@xmath1 .",
    "the gap between two classes is especially significant at @xmath52 w hz@xmath1 .",
    "there are 52 radio sources with @xmath24 w hz@xmath1 and 81 radio sources with @xmath47 w hz@xmath1 . above @xmath52 w hz@xmath1 ,",
    "* every * bcg has a confirmed cool core , small or large .",
    "in fact , there are only two non - detections of cool cores out of 81 bcgs above @xmath60 of @xmath61 w hz@xmath1 , which is the dividing line between the star - formation and agn components in the local radio lf ( e.g. , sadler et al .",
    "below that threshold , radio emission from star formation begins to dominate the local radio lf .",
    "this threshold was also used in the statistical studies by lin & mohr ( 2007 ) and von der linden et al .",
    "upper limits of both non - detections ( as405 and a2572 ) are high ( fig .",
    "1 ) as both observations are short ( 7.9 ks ) with acis - i , especially for as405 at @xmath62=0.0613 .",
    "a faint soft x - ray point source is actually detected in the position of a2572 s bcg ( @xmath62=0.0403 ) but was rejected as a corona as the error of the power law index is too large ( s07 ; section 3 ) .",
    "thus , the current data are consistent with the conclusion that all bcgs with @xmath47 w hz@xmath1 have a cool core , small or large .",
    "bcgs with small coronae often host radio agn as luminous as those bcgs in large cool cores .",
    "we call these two classes the large - cool - core ( lcc ) class and the corona class .",
    "the cool cores in the lcc class are the cool cores that were generally referred in the cluster papers .",
    "the corona class defined by this work also includes @xmath4 5 systems with small cool cores ( up to 25 kpc in radius ) but larger than typical coronae ( less than 5 kpc in radius generally ) .",
    "we present the properties of the x - ray sources associated with @xmath24 w hz@xmath1 radio agn in the corona class in table 2 ( also including non - bcgs ) .",
    "some examples of bcg coronae associated with strong radio agn are also shown in fig . 2 and 3 .",
    "we emphasize that the clusters or groups shown in fig .",
    "2 and 3 were considered `` noncool core '' systems by previous work ( e.g. , mittal et al .",
    "2009 ) so other mechanisms ( e.g. , cluster merger ) had to be used to explain strong radio agn .",
    "awm4 is another example .",
    "it was once considered as a puzzle as it hosts a radio agn but lacks a large cool core from the  data ( gastaldello et al .",
    "the new  data ( released in late may , 2009 , after the initial submission of this paper ) clearly show the presence of a small ( @xmath4 2 kpc radius ) , thermal corona associated with the bcg ( fig .",
    "3 ) .      as shown in fig .",

    "orthogonal fit ( akritas & bershady 1996 ) , @xmath63 .",
    "why does this correlation exist for the lcc class ?",
    "it is not clear that this is related to radio feedback . on the other hand ,",
    "environmental radio boosting can tilt the lcc class to the observed trend , as more luminous cool cores are generally bigger and are more capable to confine the radio lobes to stop adiabatic expansion ( e.g. , barthel & arnaud 1996 ; parma et al . 2007 ) .",
    "radio lobes can then be brighter and exist for a longer life time .",
    "thus , it is necessary to re - produce fig . 1 for the radio nuclei , jets and lobes separately .",
    "however , the relevant data are not available for most radio agn in this sample .",
    "we leave the question of the tilted lcc class to future work as the corona class is the focus of this work .    the most intriguing result in fig .",
    "1 is for galaxy groups .",
    "there are 19 groups with a cool core that is more luminous than @xmath64 ergs s@xmath1 , but none of them hosts a @xmath24 w hz@xmath1 agn . even at a lower radio luminosity threshold ( 3@xmath0 w hz@xmath1 ) ,",
    "groups in the corona class outnumber groups in the lcc class by 18 to 1 , while there are in fact less cluster bcgs in the corona class than the lcc class ( 16 versus 27 ) .",
    "this deficiency of high @xmath42 groups in the upper portion of the lcc class is not observed in clusters .",
    "two local systems ignored in our sample ( but included in the b55 and the hiflugcs - e samples , see section 7.4 ) , the virgo cluster and the fornax cluster , also fit into this picture .",
    "the virgo cluster hosts a @xmath65 w hz@xmath1 agn in the center but its temperature is @xmath4 2.3 kev ( e.g. , shibata et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the central radio source in the fornax cluster is faint ( @xmath66 w hz@xmath1 ) .",
    "is the deficiency of luminous group cool cores with a strong radio agn a selection bias from the heterogeneous nature of our sample ?",
    "nearby groups are observed by  either because they are bright or they host bright central radio galaxies ( so selected by the agn panels ) .",
    "groups are then likely under - represented in the lower portion of the corona class , but they are much less likely to be missed in the upper portion of the lcc class .",
    "the absence of @xmath67 ergs s@xmath1 cool cores with a strong radio agn for groups and poor clusters is also the reason why there is a gap between two classes at high radio luminosity .",
    "nevertheless , this result needs to be examined with samples unbiased to the above conclusion ( e.g. , optically selected ) .",
    "if this result holds , it may point to a bigger role of radio outbursts for group gas than for cluster gas , as the gas cores of groups are more vulnerable to powerful radio outbursts compared to the larger , hotter gas cores of clusters .",
    "the properties of embedded coronae have been presented and discussed in detail by s07 .",
    "jeltema et al . (",
    "2008 ) presented a similar analysis on coronae in groups .",
    "we have added many more coronae for bcgs . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , x - ray luminosities of coronae show little correlation with the radio luminosities of the galaxy , although coronae with strong radio agn are usually luminous . as emphasized in s07 and early in this paper , small coronae in the upper portion of the corona class",
    "will be destroyed even if only @xmath50 1% of agn heating is acted inside the corona .",
    "being in rich environments ( especially if in hot clusters ) , it is difficult to rebuild these mini - cool cores from stellar mass loss , once they are destroyed .",
    "s07 and this work show that very few coronae of massive galaxies should have been destroyed in this way .",
    "powerful radio jets may simply penetrate the coronal atmosphere with very little energy deposition .",
    "however , if radio outbursts have little impact inside a small corona , is radio heating still responsible for quenching cooling inside a corona and turning off the nuclear activity ?",
    "this is the same cooling / heating question in large cool cores .",
    "compared small coronae with large cool cores , the global cooling is much weaker ( but still strong in the center ) while heating is not apparently different from that in large cool cores ( fig .",
    "1 ) . we will return to this issue in section 7 .",

    "2008 ) , which is always small . as discussed in section 6 ,",
    "the real contribution is even much smaller as we always used the immediate local background that also includes much stellar emission .",

    "there are some non - detections of coronae for massive galaxies in fig .",
    "5 . generally the upper limits are still high .",
    "interestingly , above @xmath70 of 3.5 @xmath71 ( or @xmath72 , the dotted line in fig .",
    "5 ) , the galaxies associated with @xmath47 w hz@xmath1 agn are generally more x - ray luminous than those with weak radio agn .",
    "massive bcgs with a moderate corona or no corona usually only have weak radio agn .",
    "thus , the strong connection between bcgs with strong radio agn and x - ray cool cores is not all because of their strong correlations with the galaxy mass .",
    "we also examined the fraction of x - ray agn ( @xmath5 ergs s@xmath1 ) in our sample .",
    "fainter agn exist in many cases ( table 2 ) .",
    "however , the confirmation and determination of their properties are often affected by bright cluster cool cores , possible intrinsic absorption and lmxbs . moreover ,",
    "fainter x - ray agn can not be well studied at @xmath20.5 anyway .",
    "the results are summarized in table 3 .",

    "the corona has low entropy and short cooling time ( fig .",

    "the detailed energy balance and evolution of gas in different phases is unclear .",
    "however , as argued in s07 , cooling in the central kpc of a luminous corona ( where most x - ray emission comes from ) should overwhelm heating so the actual mass deposition rate should not be reduced much from the above estimates .",

    "one issue we did not discuss is galaxy merger as many bcgs are dumbbells .",
    "although the connection between the various gas components is unclear , we suggest that the existence of an x - ray corona with high pressure can effectively shield dust and cold gas from strong evaporation and stripping by the icm , especially in hot clusters .      if small coronae are responsible to fuel strong radio agn ( either through cold accretion of the cooled materials or through hot accretion ) , is radio heating responsible to offset strong cooling inside coronae ? as a complete radio feedback cycle is generally assumed in large cool cores ( summarized in e.g. , mcnamara & nulsen 2007 ) , another way to put the question is : is the radio feedback cycle complete in small coronae as in large cool cores ?",
    "the icm surrounding a corona is clearly decoupled from the feedback cycle , simply absorbing heat from unrelated radio outbursts . as discussed in s07 and early in this paper",
    ", it requires a fine tuning for a strong radio outburst to offset cooling inside a small corona without completely destroying it , which is not a problem for large cool cores .",

    "other heat sources inside coronae do exist as discussed in s07 , e.g. , stellar mass loss and sn heating .",
    "however , these heating terms should follow the shallow stellar light profile so cooling will always overwhelm within 2 - 3 kpc from the nucleus ( s07 ) .",

    "a @xmath125 ergs outburst will not disrupt a luminous corona too much ( e.g. , 4@xmath126 ergs for s corona ) , which is about the amount of gentle heating required to offset cooling in a small corona .",
    "thus , gentle heating from weak radio agn may complete the feedback cycle in coronae .",
    "however , this is not exactly the answer to strong radio agn in the upper portion of the corona class , as it is unknown what will turn them to a lower activity state if the strong radio heating is not involved in the feedback cycle .",
    "maybe radio heating of the coronal gas is only important in weak outbursts , while heating is only on the surrounding icm in strong outbursts . during the period of strong outbursts , sn heating inside coronae",
    "can still offset some cooling and the stellar mass loss can compensate a significant portion of gas cooled out of the hot phase ( s07 ) .",

    "w hz@xmath1 can provide that amount of energy on average ( brzan et al .",
    "2008 ) , especially if the biasing factors to the brzan et al . relation discussed in the last section are considered .",
    "the existence of a significant number of strong radio agn in the corona class has important implications for the radio agn heating and formation of large cool cores . as shown in this work and some previous work ( e.g. , hardcastle et al .",
    "2007 ) , ism accretion in early - type galaxies is sufficient to power fr - i radio agn , long before a large cluster cool core is formed .",
    "the radio outburst injects a large amount of heat into the surrounding icm and is capable to destroy embryonic large icm cool cores beyond the central several kpc .",
    "therefore , this provides another way to prevent formation of large cool cores in some clusters , besides the scenario of major mergers at an early stage proposed by burns et al .",
    "nevertheless , large cool cores do form .",
    "radio agn heating in massive clusters may not be strong enough to balance cooling ( e.g. , best et al .",
    "a dense corona of a bcg may also not form because of high sn rate and merging rate so the corona feedback has never been triggered to destroy an embryonic icm cool core .",
    "it would be useful to know the percentage of large cool cores ( or coronae ) for bcgs as a function of the cluster mass and redshift .",
    "our heterogeneous sample indeed implies that the fraction of coronae for bcgs increases when the cluster mass decreases ( fig .",
    "the dense coronal gas is also important to maintain the collimation of radio jets ( e.g. , fabian & rees 1995 ) .",
    "there is no evidence for slower milli - arcsec scale jets of fr - i sources in comparison to fr - ii sources ( giovannini et al .",

    "nevertheless , this simple comparison shows that jet flaring would be at much larger radii if the radio agn is `` naked '' in the icm .",
    "while a corona helps to decelerate jets , its small size also allows the bulk of the jet energy to be able to transfer to large radii of the system .",
    "this was revealed in the detailed modeling for jet deceleration in 3c  31 ( laing & bridle 2002 ) .",
    "they concluded that a small x - ray cool core , associated with the bcg ngc  383 rather than with the surrounding icm , is required for the jet to decelerate without disruption .",
    "this is in contrast with large cool cores , where radio jets and lobes are much more likely to be contained , with less energy being able to deposit at the outskirts of the system .",
    "this effect is especially important for groups , where the central cool cores are generally smaller than those in rich clusters with a large cool core .",
    "hardcastle & sakelliou ( 2004 ) studied jet termination in wat radio sources .",
    "they presented an anti - correlation between the jet termination length and the cluster temperature .",
    "one scenario listed in the paper is that the jet disruption coincides with the ism / icm interface .",
    "seven wats in their sample are in our sample . clearly from this work and s07 , the ism coronae have radii of typically a few kpc ( also see the pressure argument in s07 ) , at most 9 - 10 kpc for 3c  465 ( s07 ) .",
    "the coronae are much smaller than the derived jet termination length ( 12 - 74 kpc ) by hardcastle & sakelliou ( 2004 ) so the above scenario can be ruled out . on the other hand , as shown in sun et al .",
