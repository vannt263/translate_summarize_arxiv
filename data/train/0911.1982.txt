    "the maximal near - uv and far - uv radiative energies of flares are akin or larger than those of an active stellar chromosphere , although flare energy is typically provided episodically rather than continuously . therefore , the results given in table 2 may also be applicable to flaring as a first approximation , except that the actual biological damage due to flares might be enhanced further by a factor of 5 to 10 due to the possible damage ( i.e. , evaporation ) of the planetary atmosphere .",
