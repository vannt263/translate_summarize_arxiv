    "recently , the interest on the phenomena of giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) in magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtj ) has grown significantly due to potential applications in magnetoresistive reading heads , magnetic field sensors , nonvolatile magnetic random access memories , and many others@xcite .",
    "the effect is based on the spin dependent scattering mechanisms proposed in the early papers by cabrera and falicov@xcite , which lead in mtj s , to a strong dependence of the conductance on the magnetic polarization@xcite .",
    "typically , the gmr effect found in mtj s is of the order of @xmath4@xcite , and points to a large ratio of the densities of states for majority ( @xmath5 ) and minority ( @xmath6 ) electrons at the fermi level ( @xmath7 ) @xmath8 as usual in mr experiments , one compares the resistances for the cases where the magnetizations at the electrodes are anti - parallel ( ap ) and parallel ( p ) . in several experiments reported in the literature",
    "( see for example ref . ) , the junction resistance drops significantly with the applied voltages , with a sharp peak at zero bias ( _ zero - bias anomaly _ ) .",
    "this bias dependence shows a rapid initial decrease up to voltages of the order of @xmath9 , then slows down but continues decreasing with voltages , up to @xmath10 of the peak value at @xmath11 in some cases @xcite .",
    "many attempts to explain the above behavior have been done over the last years @xcite , but a complete theory which includes all the observed features is still lacking .    in ref .",
    ", scattering from magnons at the electrode - insulator interface has been proposed as the mechanism for randomizing the tunneling process and opening the spin - flip channels that reduce the mr .",
    "while this process may explain the mr behavior in the vicinity of zero - bias ( voltages smaller than @xmath12 ) , estimations of magnon scattering cross sections show that the effect is too small to account for the sharp drop in resistance observed in the whole range of @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , inelastic - electron tunneling spectroscopy ( iets ) measurements at low temperature showed peaks which can unambiguously be associated with one - magnon spectra at very small voltages ( from @xmath14 to @xmath15 , with tails up to @xmath16 , and maximum magnon energy not larger than @xmath17 @xmath18 ) @xcite . to go beyond this limit",
    "will imply multimagnon processes , which are negligible at low temperature .",
    "this way , the electron - magnon coupling constant coming from ref . is by sure considerable overestimated .",
    "the above explanation@xcite has been challenged in ref . , where it is shown that the experimental data can be understood in terms of elastic tunneling currents which conserve spin , by considering effects not taken into account in ref . .",
    "those include the lowering of the effective barrier height with the applied voltage , as in the classical simmons theory@xcite , and most important , variations of the densities of states with the bias at both magnetic electrodes .",
    "the latter is a relevant question , since experiments probe depths of the order of @xmath19 @xmath20 from the fermi surface .",
    "the simple calculation developed in ref .",
    "models the band structure with free electron - like densities of states , since the tunneling current is dominated by the _ s-_electron contribution .",
    "this approach yields a _ zero bias _",
    "anomaly which depends on the band structure , and a variation of the mr which has the right order of magnitude for the whole range of @xmath21 @xmath18 .",
    "the above discussion and other experimental results primarily exhibit that the density of states dependence on the applied voltage plays an important role @xcite . however , fine details of experiments at very small voltages are difficult to fit .",
    "one may adopt here a pragmatic procedure , with a more intricate band structure and more free parameters to improve the fitting@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we take a different stand , motivated by results from iets experiments@xcite , which show that inelastic scattering do participate in the phenomenon at very small voltages .",
    "also , mr experiments@xcite show clearly a different behavior with applied voltage in the same small bias region ( up to @xmath17 @xmath22 ) .",
    "a complete theory then should include :    1 .",
    "magnon assisted tunneling effects , with maximum magnon energies of the order of @xmath23 @xmath18 . at low temperature , electrons from the electrodes , accelerated by the applied voltage ,",
    "excite magnons at the interface . at low temperature ,",
    "only magnon - emission processes should be considered ; 2 .",
    "variation with voltages of the densities of states for the different spin bands in the ferromagnets . here , we will follow closely the approach of ref .",
    ", with a simple picture of the band structure .",
    "this is motivated by the discussions given in ref . and over the polarization of the tunneling current .",
    "we assume here that the latter is mainly of _",
    "s_-character ; 3 .",
    "lowering of the effective barrier height with the applied voltage .",
    "this effects , as shown in ref .",
    ", yields to a parabolic dependence of the resistance with the bias .",
    "it does not contribute to the _ zero - bias _",
    "anomaly , but it is always present and should dominate the behavior at large voltages .",
    "the above program will be developed in the present contribution .",
    "the content of this paper can be described as follows : in the next section , we formulate the theoretical basis for analyzing tunneling currents , discussing the transfer hamiltonian which includes all the above mentioned ingredients . in section 3 ,",
    "we solely analyze density of states effects , considering elastic tunneling processes .",
    "some analytical expressions are shown . in section 4 ,",
    "we include contributions from inelastic magnon - assisted processes to the tunneling current , and finally , in the last section , a few conclusions and remarks are added .",
    "to give a description of the mr and the resistance in the mtj , we will use the transfer hamiltonian method @xcite .",
    "the junction is composed by two ferromagnetic electrodes separated by a thin oxide film which represents a potential barrier due to the fact that the fermi levels of the ferromagnetic layers are situated in the gap region of the oxide film .",
    "we have considered the _",
    "s_-band electrons as free particles ( plane - waves ) , being responsible for the dominant contribution to the tunneling process .",
    "electrons , which are more localized , enter in the process only via the exchange interaction with _ s _ electrons on each ferromagnetic electrode . in the context of second quantization and neglecting the magnetization energy ( zeeman term ) , the unperturbed hamiltonian is given by @xmath24 with @xmath25 referring to the left ( right ) ferromagnetic electrode , @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) are the creation ( annihilation ) fermionic operators for wave vector @xmath28 and spin @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the hartree - fock energy and @xmath31 is the shift in energy due to exchange interaction in each side of the barrier .    in writing the interaction part of the total hamiltonian , which makes possible the transfer of electrons from one side of the insulating barrier to the other , we follow ref .. apart from the direct transfer which comes from elastic processes , we include transfer with magnetic excitations that originates from the _ s - d _ exchange between conduction electrons and localized spins at the interfaces .",
    "the excitations are described by a linearized holstein - primakoff transformation @xcite , in the spirit of a one - magnon theory .",
    "we use the following hamiltonian :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the direct transmission coefficient , @xmath34 is the inelastic transmission coefficient ( depends on the exchange integral ) , @xmath35(@xmath36 ) is the spin value at the left ( right ) side , @xmath37 is the total number of spins at the interface , and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) are the creation ( annihilation ) operators for magnons with wave vector @xmath40 at each interface between the barrier and the electrodes .",
    "the wave vector @xmath41 is quasi - two dimensional ( the magnon wave function is localized at the interfaces , but with finite localization length ) .    in general , the total current obtained with ( [ hint ] ) has contributions from elastic processes , resulting in a direct tunneling which conserves spin , and from the inelastic ones , which involve emission and absorption of magnons with electronic spin flip . in the following",
    "we describe the direct term .",
    "considering only the direct part of the tunneling process , which means elastic processes , without involving magnon excitations , the current is easily obtained by @xcite    @xmath42   \\label{id1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath43 and @xmath44 denotes the configuration scheme , @xmath45 for parallel and @xmath46 for anti - parallel , @xmath47 is the fermi - dirac distribution , @xmath48 and @xmath49 the density of states at the right and left electrodes , respectively .",
    "@xmath50 is the tunneling coefficient , being a function of the energy @xmath51 , the applied voltage @xmath52 , the thickness of the barrier @xmath53 and the barrier height @xmath54 .",
    "in fact , @xmath1 is a function of the overlap integral between the left and right wave functions inside the barrier region .",
    "the resistance is readily obtained by @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the differential conductance . in the low bias regime",
    ", we are interested in voltages smaller than the fermi energy and only the states near the fermi level will contribute to the transport , so we can expand the density of states in a taylor series as follows :    @xmath57    now , let us calculate @xmath58 for the @xmath59 and @xmath60 configurations , using ( [ taylor ] ) . in the @xmath59 configuration",
    "the majority and minority bands in each electrode corresponds to the same spin orientation , and in @xmath60 configuration the majority band of one electrode is the minority on the other : @xmath61 \\right| _ { e_{f}}\\left ( e - e_{f}\\right ) ^{i}\\left ( e - ev - e_{f}\\right ) ^{j}\\ ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and    @xmath62 \\right| _ { e_{f}}\\left ( e - e_{f}\\right ) ^{i}\\left ( e - ev - e_{f}\\right ) ^{j}\\ ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    taking into account identical electrodes and the low bias regime , we can expand these expressions to first order with good accuracy .",
    "the _ s_-band can be represented by a parabolic dispersion relation and density of states @xmath63 , where @xmath64 gives the bottom of the spin band , with @xmath65 as in ref . .",
    "however , we consider here cases more general than the parabolic dispersion , with the band structure described through the following set of parameters : @xmath66 with all quantities evaluated at the fermi level , and @xmath6 and @xmath5 stand for minority and majority spin bands , respectively . we get the analytic expressions :    @xmath67    and    @xmath68    where @xmath69 and @xmath70 and @xmath52 must be given in @xmath20 .",
    "there are several possibilities for including the tunneling transmission coefficient @xmath1 in the theory .",
    "one is the approach followed by simmons @xcite , where the barrier is parametrized by an effective height @xmath54 and an effective thickness @xmath53 : @xmath71\\ = \\exp \\left [ -1.024\\ d\\sqrt{\\phi _ { 0}}\\right ] \\exp \\left [ \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\eta \\epsilon } { \\sqrt{\\phi _ { 0}}}\\right ] \\label{transm}\\ ] ] where all energies are measured from the fermi level and given in @xmath20 , the barrier width given in @xmath72 , and @xmath73 is some constant relating the energy @xmath70 with its component @xmath74 perpendicular to the barrier .",
    "this latter parameter appears due to the fact that we are using a one dimensional formula to explain the behavior in the @xmath75 case .",
