    "usually named as ads / qcd @xcite , a weakly coupled ads@xmath0 background ",
    "dual to conformal symmetry of the 4d field theory  is assumed .",
    "indeed , the asymptotic freedom makes qcd to be approximately conformal at high energies .",
    "thereafter , bulk fields , which are dual to qcd operators through the ads / cft correspondence , are included into the 5d framework .",
    "ads / qcd has a reasonable agreement with experimental results for both ratios of meson masses and structure constants , whenever the bulk setup regards fundamental features of low energy qcd @xcite .",
    "gauge / gravity duality has been applied to study aspects of qcd , as to compare the existing predictions to qcd data @xcite and to study theories that are also based on those data @xcite . in this context , the ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) limits in ads / qcd can be relevant . in particular , the uv limit reproduces the scaling behavior of qcd scattering amplitudes , whereas the ir regime in the extra dimension , at the qcd scale provided by @xmath2 , is able to carry out the discrete hadron spectra as well as the mass gap .",
    "the so - called hard - wall qcd predicts squared masses of particles that are quadratic functions of principal and spin quantum numbers @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it does not comply with the linear regge behavior of the mass mesonic spectra @xcite , that can be derived by considering an ads@xmath3 bulk geometry through the addition of an ir suppressed bulk scalar field @xcite  the dilaton background  that depends on the extra dimension , that behaves as an energy scale , and that realises conformal symmetry breaking , accordingly @xcite .",

    "moreover , the ads / qcd correspondence is introduced when a cut - off , or hard wall , is considered at some point in the bulk .",
    "hence , the gravity branch of the theory is defined only from this cut - off , ensuring confinement , since , in fact , the scale cut - off corresponds to a mass gap .",

    "the formation of light - flavour mesons in ads / qcd soft wall models , in a procedure relating their spins to their respective conditional entropy , can be scrutinized .",
    "the concept of informational entropy regards the unpredictability of information in a system and has been applied to compact systems @xcite .",
    "the lattice approach of shannon information entropy measures the shape complexity of spatially localized physical configurations , providing an informational measure of the complexity of a system that has spatial profile , in terms of its frequency ( through its fourier transform ) @xcite .",
    "the lower the information entropy , the less information encoded in the frequency modes , is required to represent the shape .",
    "the lattice approach of shannon information entropy has been successfully applied in several contexts , encompassing non - equilibrium dynamics @xcite , stability bounds for compact objects @xcite and cosmology @xcite .",
    "the conditional entropy encrypts an extension of the shannon entropy to a continuum limit of the system modes of spatially - localized density functions , based upon their fourier transforms , that can provide , for example , reliable bounds on the stability of physical systems .",
    "it shall be shown that the statistical mechanics content @xcite of the modal fraction is the normalized structure factor , up to a constant .",
    "it provides a robust physical basis for what one knows as configurational entropy , establishing its limitations in the continuum limit , which is provided by the solid grounds of statistical mechanics .",
    "the conditional entropy satisfies all the required properties of entropy and will be here employed in the soft wall model of ads / qcd to demonstrate that the lower the spin , the higher the informational organization is , in the configuration structure of light flavour mesonic systems .",
    "this work is organised as follows : in sect .",
    "ii , the statistical mechanics grounds that underlie the information entropy are provided , and the range of their applications in the continuum limit of system frequency modes is discussed . the well - known collective coordinates and the structure factor in statistical mechanics , associated to the energy density of the system , shall be shown to be the main ingredients to establish the relationship between the conditional entropy with the thermodynamical entropy .",
    "the well - known modal fraction , in the information entropy setup , is established as the normalized structure factor , constructed upon the collective coordinates in statistical mechanics , and associated to the energy density of the system , as the seminal constituent that endows the conditional entropy with thermodynamical grounds . in order to classify excited light - flavour mesons in the context of the information entropy , in sect .",
    "iii , the framework for dynamical ads / qcd holographic models is introduced , deriving the collective coordinates and the structure factors for arbitrary meson spins .",
    "hence the information entropy of the system is analysed by means of the conditional entropy . from the point of view of the conditional entropy , light - flavour mesons with lower spins",
    "are then shown to be more stable than higher spin mesonic states .",
    "the sakai - sugimoto model is further employed and compared with the our previous results . conclusively",
    ", the conditional entropy is shown to point towards the more frequent occurrence of lower spin light - flavour mesons in nature .",
    "our final conclusions are drawn in sect .",
    "iv , also analysing the higher spin mesons contributions , due to large @xmath4 suppression , in the conditional entropy setup .",
    "the entropic information is realised by the conditional entropy , for spatially - localised solutions in field theories @xcite .",
    "it has been latterly propounded as a precise paradigm based upon the shannon information entropy .",
    "the so - called configurational entropy ( ce ) has a prominent importance in the lattice approach , containing finite frequency modes , and it has been applied with success in a variety of problems @xcite . the entropic information paradigm realised by the ce shall be here applied to study the entropic information content and the stability of light - flavour mesonic field configurations , within the ads / qcd framework that shall be established in sect . [ ili ] .",
    "the entropic information measure is useful for quantifying the informational and organizational content encoded by the energy density of physical solutions @xcite . in this context , besides the least action principle , physical systems do not only minimise the corresponding action , being the entropic information also optimised .",
    "hence , entropic - informationally stable physical systems always have an optimised configurational organization , accordingly glst . states of higher ce either demand more energy to be produced , or are more rarely observed than their configurationally stable counterparts , or both .",
    "the ce is based upon the shannon information paradigm @xcite , being originally defined , for a discrete system consisting of @xmath5 modes , by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 denotes some probability density function that describes the studied system .",
    "historically , @xmath8 is called the information entropy @xcite .",
    "the ce , indeed , encrypts a well - established setup , wherein the entropy is defined as ( minus ) the sum @xmath9 , and encompasses additional entropy formulations , namely the nat entropy and the hartley entropy , respectively for @xmath10 and @xmath11 , besides the shannon entropy for @xmath12 .",
    "such definition is compatible with the interpretation that ce defines the best lossless compression of any exchange of information , namely , any communication inside , or even out of , the system .",
    "the higher the ce , the higher the unpredictability of information content in the system is .",
    "hence , the ce carries the entropic information in physical system configurations , and can be used , further , to bound any physical parameter in the system , as well as to corroborate with experimental , phenomenological or observational data .",
    "it is worth to mention that if the system conveys @xmath5 modes with equal weights , then the relation @xmath13 holds for the relative probability mass functions .",
    "entropy is maximum when the symbols have equal probabilities .",
    "hence , the discrete ce presents a maximum value at @xmath14 . on the other hand , when the system presents a single mode , then @xmath15 , as it is expected glst .",
    "the expression for @xmath8 indicates the system non - determination degree , from an informational viewpoint , and is analogous to the boltzmann - gibbs entropy in thermodynamics , expressing the disorder degree in a physical system .",
    "moreover , kolmogorov established the relationship between the conditional entropy with the thermodynamical entropy in physics @xcite .",
    "this setup provides a reliable measure of bounds on the stability and on the entropic information content of physical systems .",
    "in fact , since the continuum limit of shannon entropy lacks some required properties that underlie any useful definition of entropy , the links between the conditional entropy and its statistical mechanics grounds must be clarified .",
    "the lattice approach of shannon information entropy is an entropy of shape , namely , an informational measure of the complexity of a system that has spatial profile , in terms of its frequency @xcite .",
    "the lower the information entropy , the less information , encoded in the frequency modes , is required to represent the shape @xcite .",
    "the continuum limit of the information entropy has been taken as an _ ad hoc _ continuum limit @xcite , however this limit is defined as being the differential entropy , that lacks fundamental properties @xcite .",
    "for example , the configurational entropy  or differential entropy  is not a limit of the shannon entropy for the number @xmath16 of modes , since it differs from the limit of the shannon entropy .",
    "the complementary part is what is called information dimension , describing the growth rate of the shannon entropy in successively finer discretizations of the space .",
    "hence , care should be taken when applying the differential entropy to physical systems . in order to circumvent those limitations regarding the continuum limit ,",
    "the lattice approach of the conditional entropy can be considered , as it has been successfully applied in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a close relationship between the information entropy and statistical thermodynamics can be derived .",
    "the most general formula for the thermodynamic entropy of a thermodynamic system is the gibbs entropy , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath19 denotes the probability of a microstate .",
    "the von neumann entropy is also defined , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the density matrix associated to the quantum mechanical system .",
    "it is worth to point out that , in thermodynamics , the entropy takes into account macroscopic measurements , that play the role ( but is not ) of a probability distribution , which defines the information entropy .",
    "nevertheless , thermodynamics can be linked to information theory by the boltzmann equation , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the number of microstates that can yield the given macrostate .",
    "the probability of a given microstate is assumed to be @xmath24 , namely , all microstates are equally likely .",
    "hence , the information entropy of a system is a measure of lacking information that is necessary to determine a microstate . in this way ,",
    "thermodynamic entropy in statistical mechanics is , thus , proportional to the quantity of shannon information that is requisite to define the microscopic state of a given system , that stays uncommunicated by a description only in terms of the macroscopic variables of classical thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "a robust formal setup , with possibilities involving entanglement entropy is provided in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "although the shannon entropy is strictly restricted to random variables that take discrete values , its continuum limit can be regarded , by considering a continuous random variable with probability density function .",
    "the conditional entropy is an extension of the shannon discrete entropy .",
    "nevertheless , a subtlety must be considered , since the continuum limit have some limitations in what concern that properties of entropy .",
    "the fourier transform of the energy density , in particular , to denote the bulk coordinate , that shall be used further in ads / qcd models . ] , @xmath25 is employed for constructing the analogue continuum limit of the collective coordinates in statistical mechanics , that are defined by @xmath26 , namely , the discretized version of eq .",

    "the entropic information driven by the ce has been here studied in the dynamical ads / qcd holographic model , realised by the solutions of the 5d einstein - dilaton system that serves a dual background , for holographic qcd .",

    "it implies that light - flavour mesons with very high spins , although not forbidden , by configurational entropic reasons , are very rare to be either produced or observed .",
    "in fact , in table i , one notices the ce for some values of spins of light - flavour mesons :        for instance , the ce for @xmath142 is @xmath143 , what makes a light - flavour meson of spin @xmath142 a configurationally unstable system with extremely high ce .",

    "it consists into a pragmatic tool for experimental physicists to test the feasibility of potentially obtainable ( qcd ) data .",
    "this setup can be applied , moreover , to an extended range of particles .    as the light flavor meson family has become increasingly abundant , the conditional entropy",
    "is closely related to the widths of observed high - spin states resonances , for spins @xmath144 , as can be checked in table i of ref .",
    "although more than twenty high - spin states are listed in @xcite , their properties are not currently well established .",
