    "cosmological hydrodynamic simulations predict that a significant amount of baryons that reside in the ly@xmath4 forest at high redshift were subsequently shock - heated to temperatures between @xmath5@xmath6 k , to form the so - called `` warm - hot intergalactic medium '' , or whim ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "high temperatures ionized most of the neutral hydrogen , making it impossible to detect the whim gas as a low redshift ly@xmath4 forest .",

    "these low redshift lines may be attributable , at least in part , to the whim gas in our local group .    starting from _ chandra _ and _ xmm_-newton observation cycle 1 , we conducted a survey of x - ray bright quasars to systematically study the potential x - ray absorption lines from the whim . in the first round , we observed two high redshift quasars ( pks 2149 - 306 and s5  0836 + 710 at @xmath10 , see @xcite ) and one low redshift quasar ( h  1821 + 643 at @xmath11 , see @xcite ) . in this paper , we present the results from our second round of the survey , which includes a total of six _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ targets , and a total exposure time of @xmath12 half - million seconds .",
    "these targets were selected largely based on their x - ray flux levels , which were determined by previous x - ray observations such as _ rosat _ and _ asca_. we also selected these targets because their low galactic absorption ( except 1h  0414 + 009 ) , and because their relatively simple spectral shape ( power law ) without any intrinsic features .",
    "two of them were selected because their uv spectra showed absorption lines . in principle",

    "we also searched for emission features and find no significant detections .",

    "we also notice none of these targets exhibit local absorption from in uv band @xcite the limits , from table  4 , are comparable to or below some of the lines detected along other lines of sight . a systematic study of detections and non - detections and their implications will be presented in a forthcoming publication .",
    "here we note that , whatever its location , the column density of local absorption fluctuates at least by a factor of two across the sky . more specifically , for 3c  279 our 3  @xmath0 limit of @xmath139 for is well below the detected value of @xmath140 for 3c  273 @xcite .",
    "these two sources are separated by an angular distance of @xmath141 .",
    "this corresponds to a linear scale of absorber structure of @xmath142 kpc , for a distance to the absorber d .. kpc is likely an upper limit .",
    "it is unlikely that the 3c  273 absorber has a distance from us of @xmath143 mpc since it will then be located even beyond our local group , see @xcite on discussion of the geometry of the local group and 3c  273 absorber . ]",
    "if the absorber is clumped on this scale , we can obtain a lower limit on the hydrogen number density of @xmath144 here we adopt a metalicity of @xmath145 and assume half the oxygen is ionized to .",
    "in this paper we present our _ chandra _ and _ xmm_-newton observations of six quasars , with redshifts ranging from @xmath14 0.1 to @xmath14 0.9 .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarized as follows",
    "we obtained the continuum information of these six targets .",
    "all of them can be fitted quite well with a power law with absorption from neutral hydrogen , although some of these targets may require additional components to achieve a better fit .",
    "2 .   our main purpose is to search for any narrow absorption features in the x - ray spectra that were produced by the whim gas . after applying an optimized local fitting technique to subtract continuum",
    ", we found a total of 30 narrow features at or above @xmath146 lever .",
    "a cross check with different instruments excludes all features .",
    "thus we conclude that no absorption feature was detected in our observations .",
    "3 .   given the size of our survey , we are able to put stronger constraints on cosmological parameters , compared with previous studies ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we find the metal abundance of the igm must be smaller than @xmath147 if we adopted a _",
    "wmap _ value of @xmath126 .",
    "4 .   we also search for local ( @xmath2 ) absorption lines , such as those that have been detected along several other lines of sight .",
    "no local absorption line was found .",
    "the limit on a ( @xmath2 ) absorber in 3c  279 compared with the detection of a strong absorption line in nearby 3c  273 indicates that the absorber has an angular scale of @xmath148 . if the 3c  273 absorber is in a cloud of this scale we estimate a lower limit on the hydrogen number density of @xmath149 .",
    "implications will be explored further in a forthcoming publication .    though several lines of evidence imply the existence of the whim gas , firm evidence for such `` missing baryons '' still remains an important challenge in cosmology .",
    "future x - ray missions are very promising for detecting whim gas ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . both _",
    "constellation_-x and _ xeus _ can probe highly ionized metals to column densities of as low as @xmath150 - @xmath151 .",
    "such high resolution and sensitivities will reveal a true `` x - ray forest '' in the igm . by comparing observations with numerical simulations and analytic analysis ,",
    "we may eventually obtain a complete theory of structure formation and evolution from the big bang to the present epoch .",
