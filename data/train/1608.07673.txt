    "from several pulsars , sporadic intense radio pulses that are much brighter than the normal pulse flux , called  giant radio pulses ( grps ) \" , are observed .",
    "the distinctive feature of grps is that the amplitude distribution of them follows a power - law ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while that of `` normal '' pulses follows a log - normal distribution @xcite .",
    "grps are detected from about ten pulsars , including some young pulsars such as the crab pulsar ( psr b0531 + 21 ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and psr b0540 - 69 @xcite , and some millisecond pulsars such as psr b1937 + 21 @xcite and psr b1821 - 24a @xcite .",
    "even some of relatively slowly rotating pulsars such as psr b0950 + 08 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show grps , and in other cases , e.g. psr b1133 + 16 @xcite , grp - like anomalous intense pulses are detected .",
    "although several theoretical models of grps have been proposed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the emission mechanism of grps has not been revealed yet .",
    "the grps from the crab pulsar are the most extensively observed , and they have provided a lot of information .",
    "the crab grps were detected in the frequency range from 20 mhz @xcite to 46 ghz @xcite .",
    "the crab grps occur at the two rotational phases : the main pulse or the interpulse phases of the normal pulse @xcite .",
    "the grp light curves often consist of a number of ( sub- ) nanosecond bursts , so - called nanoshots .",
    "the peak flux densities of them sometimes exceed several million jy , and the brightness temperatures of them sometimes reach @xmath3k @xcite , which are higher than any other astronomical phenomena ever found ( e.g. figure 7 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    from simultaneous multi - frequency observations ,",
    "the spectra of the crab grps have been investigated in several studies .",
    "@xcite showed that the spectral indices distribute between @xmath4 and @xmath5 for the grps simultaneously detected at 0.6 and 1.4 ghz .",
    "@xcite also reported the index distribution between @xmath4 and @xmath6 based on observations at 0.2 and 1.4 ghz . at 1.301.45 ghz",
    ", @xcite claimed that the indices of the grps occurring at the main pulse and the interpulse phases were @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "they also reported that some fractions of grps were not detected at the frequency sub - bands of 1.301.45 ghz , indicating narrow - band spectral feature intrinsic to the grps . from simultaneous observations at 0.6 , 1.65 and 4.85 ghz , @xcite claimed that the average grp spectra seem to be bent harder with increasing frequency . even in @xcite , based on 27 samples observed at 0.6 , 1.4 and 2.2 ghz , the spectral hardening with frequency was claimed again .",
    "recently , the discovery of another sporadic phenomenon , fast radio bursts ( frbs ) , has been reported ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "frbs are radio transients having a few millisecond duration , and have high dispersion measures ( hereafter dms ) which exceed that expected from the interstellar medium of our own galaxy . considering the large dm , the origin of the frbs is extragalactic , but the source object itself is not unknown .",
    "repeating bursts were observed from a position of frb 121102 @xcite with a power - law distribution of its fluence @xcite , which rules out catastrophic events such as a neutron star merger ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and a white dwarf merger @xcite at least for this frb .",
    "grps from young pulsars are discussed as one of the candidates of the frb ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "revealing the spectral features of known grps are indispensable to test the young pulsar model as a candidate of frbs , and provide the expected event rate in other energy bands ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    motivated by the situation mentioned above , we operated simultaneous multi - frequency observations of the crab grps at 0.3 , 1.6 , 2.2 , 6.7 and 8.4 ghz with the four radio telescopes in japan , and report the results in this paper .",
    "in most of the previous studies , the sample number of grps is insufficient to discuss the statistical properties of the spectra , except for @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite",
    "focused only the average spectrum based on @xmath9 samples , while the frequency separation ( @xmath10 ) in the observation of @xcite is too narrow to discuss the global structure of the spectra .",
    "our study is carried on in order to overcome those weak points .",
    "the outline of our observation and data analysis are described in section [ obs ] .",
    "spectral analyses with about 3200 main pulse grps and about 250 interpulse grps at a frequency range from 0.3 to 2.2 ghz , are shown in section [ 3band ] .",
    "we also show some examples that apparently contradict with a single power - law .",
    "wider spectra from 0.3 to 8.4 ghz are shown in section [ 5band ] .",
    "our results are summarized with discussion in section [ dis ] .",
    "our radio wide - band observational campaign was conducted from utc 14@xmath1130@xmath12 on september 6 to 04@xmath1100@xmath12 on september 7 , 2014 .",
    "simultaneous observations at all observatories were overlapped from utc 21@xmath1135@xmath12 on september 6 to 02@xmath1120@xmath12 on september 7 .",
    "we summarize our observation in table [ t1 ] .",
    "cclccccc    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     for the brighter sub - groups of @xmath13 , the obtained values of @xmath14 are consistent with the prospective fluence @xmath15 .",
    "however , for the dimmer sub - groups , @xmath16 for mpgrps and @xmath17 for ipgrps , the values of @xmath14 become higher than the corresponding range of @xmath15 .",
    "if the spl hypothesis is correct even for such dimmer grps , the above contradiction may be due to the contribution of the normal pulse .",
    "since we have assumed that the normal pulse is absent at the grp periods , we have not subtracted the contribution of the normal pulse . for such low - fluence grps , the method to distinguish grps from the normal pulses is not established so far .",
    "another interpretation for the discrepancy between @xmath14 and @xmath15 is that non - spl grps are contaminated in group ( ii ) samples .      in the previous subsection",
    ", we have found signatures of a possible correlation between the fluence at p band and hardness . however , the observational bias obscures the conclusion for the correlation . to probe clues about the correlation from another angle ,",
    "we discuss the correlation between the l / s band fluence and hardness in this subsection .",
    "we choose the grps whose spectra are consistent with spls in group ( i ) ( see tables [ tcatmp ] and section [ cate ] ) .",
    "the uncertainty in the spectral index are relatively low owing to the wide frequency separation between p and l / s bands ( see section [ cate ] ) .",
    "we show scatter plots of the fluences at ll or s band and the indices @xmath18 in figures [ flualpha - ls ] and [ flualpha - ls_ip ] for the mpgrps and ipgrps , respectively .",
    "since the detection limit becomes deepest at lh band , the fluence limit at ll band is the fluence at ll band for a spl grp whose fluences at lh and p bands are on the detection limit .",
    "the apparent correlations between the fluence and hardness are seen clearly . from the spearman",
    "rank correlation coefficients , the @xmath19-values for the correlation absence described in the previous subsection are @xmath20 and @xmath21 for mpgrps at ll and s bands , respectively .",
    "while we have omitted the results for lh band , the results are similar ( 91 samples , @xmath22 for mpgrps and 28 samples , @xmath23 for ipgrps ) .",
    "the deficit of samples in the upper - left region can be due to the selection bias .",
    "however , the deficit in the lower - right region can not be explained by the selection bias .",
    "contrary to the case of p band , a positive correlation between the fluence and spectral hardness is found in the cases of l / s bands .",
    "if the negative correlation in the p band case is real , our results suggest that the fluences at p band and l / s band have an anti - correlation .",
    "this is intuitively understood from figure [ sp4 ] .",
    "since the most of the grp energy is released at p band or lower frequencies , the anti - correlation means that more energetic grps tend to show softer spectra .",
    "alphaplot_ls_ps_mpgp.eps    alphaplot_ls_ps_ipgp.eps    we carry out monte carlo simulations to reproduce the scatter distributions without an intrinsic correlation between the l band fluence and hardness ( see appendix [ montecarlo ] ) .",
    "when we assume that the typical spectral index is close to that of the normal pulse @xmath24 , the spearman coefficient in the @xmath25@xmath18 diagram can not be reproduced . however ,",
    "if we assume the typical index @xmath1 , harder than the normal pulse s one , the apparent correlations in both the @xmath25@xmath18 and @xmath26@xmath18 are reproduced .",
    "this is consistent with the hard spectrum implied from the stacking analysis .",
    "given @xmath25 , a smaller @xmath18 implies a brighter p band fluence , where the most of energy is released .",
    "namely , the uncorrelation between @xmath25 and @xmath18 is equivalent to an anti - correlation between the total energy release and hardness .",
    "therefore , the apparent correlations in figures [ flualpha ] , [ flualpha - ip ] , [ flualpha - ls ] , and [ flualpha - ls_ip ] imply that a more energetic grp tends to have a softer spectrum . in our samples , the p band grps ,",
    "including group ( iii ) grps , whose spectrum should be very soft , are energetic samples compared to group ( ii ) grps .",
    "the different average @xmath18 for p band grps and group ( ii ) grps also indicates the anti - correlation between the energy release and hardness .",
    "when we add the grps in group ( ii ) for the correlation analysis , a significant correlation is not found .",
    "this may be partially due to the large errors in the index of group ( ii ) grps .",
    "alternatively , another type of grps whose spectra are not spls may be contaminated in group ( ii ) samples .",
    "the fractions of the grps judged to be inconsistent with spls at a significance level of 5% are 28.4% and 24.9% for the mpgrps and the ipgrps , respectively . when the significance level is set to 0.1% ( @xmath27 ) ,",
    "the fractions are 14.2% and 14.6% for the mpgrps and the ipgrps , respectively .",
    "examples of the spectra apparently inconsistent with spls are shown in figure [ chisqhigh ] . some spectra show softening or hardening at higher frequencies . such hard - to - soft ( left ) , soft - to - hard ( center ) , and other ( right )",
    "examples are displayed in the figure .",
    "@xcite claimed that grp spectra tend to show soft - to - hard behavior at 0.62.2 ghz . in order to examine this tendency",
    ", we choose 182 mpgrps and 19 ipgrps that are detected at all the bands from p to s , and are inconsistent with spl spectra at a significance level of 5% . in those mpgrp samples ,",
    "the fractions of hard - to - soft , soft - to - hard , and other spectra are 48 ( 26% ) , 76 ( 42% ) , and 58 ( 32% ) , respectively .",
    "for the 19 ipgrps , the numbers are 3 ( 16% ) , 4 ( 21% ) , and 12 ( 63% ) , respectively .",
    "we do not find a clear tendency in the spectral behavior .",
    "we find 1 ( 0.03% ) ultra - soft ( @xmath28 ) and 35 ( 1.1% ) ultra - hard ( @xmath29 ) mpgrps , and we also find 1 ( 0.4% ) ultra - soft ipgrps ( see figure [ super ] ) . in our grp samples , no ultra - hard ipgrp is found .",
    "in this section , we discuss the grps detected at c and/or x band(s ) . note that the fluences at c and x bands are expected to be affected by intensity modulation due to the interstellar scintillation .",
    "we find 5 mpgrps and 19 ipgrps exceeding the selection thresholds ( see section [ grpsel ] and table [ t1 ] ) at c and/or x band(s ) .",
    "all of these 5 mpgrps were simultaneously detected at some of the frequency bands of p , l or s band .",
    "in contrast , all the 19 ipgrps were detected only at x band .",
    "as for the ipgrps in groups ( i ) and ( ii ) discussed in section [ 3band ] , the spectra may have a cut - off below the x band frequency .    in figure [ golden ] , we show the spectrum of the mpgrp # 2677 , whose pulse profiles and dynamic spectra are shown in figures [ dynsp1 ] and [ sp1 ] , respectively .",
    "the spectrum is consistent with a spl at p  x bands at a significance level of 5% .",
    "this is only the case consistent with a spl in the 5 mpgrps .    as seen in figure",
    "[ golden ] , the light curve shows two distinct components , so that we attempt to obtain the temporally divided spectra here .",
    "when we divide the light curve into two intervals a and b defined in figure [ golden ] , it turns out that the spectrum for the interval b needs a high - frequency cut - off . in figure",
    "[ sp1 ] , many finer ( sub-@xmath30s ) structures ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are found in the light curve .",
    "the spectrum may consist of further more components as well .",
    "the spectra of the other four mpgrps are inconsistent with spls as shown in figure [ bronze ] .",
    "the p band fluence of grp # 3012 is about three orders of magnitude brighter than fluences at the higher frequency bands .",
    "the spectrum seems to consist of two or more different components , which may be supported by the slight misalignment of the peak times ( @xmath31s ) between the light curves in s and c / x bands .",
    "the small uncertainty of the toa between ll and x bands ( @xmath32s ) suggets that the @xmath33s misalignment is intrinsic feature .",
    "the pulse profile of grp # 0703 appears to have multiple components ( especially at l and s bands ) , similarly to the grp # 2677 ( figure [ golden ] ) .",
    "the stringent upper - limit at x band requires a sharp high - frequency cut - off in the spectrum . for grp # 0703 ,",
    "the temporally divided spectra are also inconsistent with spls and need low / high frequency breaks or cut - offs .",
    "the broadband ( 0.3 , 1.6 , 2.2 , 6.7 and 8.4 ghz ) simultaneous observation of the grps from the crab pulsar was conducted with four japanese observatories , iitate , kashima , usuda , and takahagi , on september 6 - 7th , 2014 .",
    "we obtained 3194 mpgrps and five of them were detected at the multiple frequency bands including 6.7 and/or 8.4 ghz .",
    "we also obtained 272 ipgrps and 19 of them were detected only at 8.4 ghz .",
    "we investigated the spectra of those grps .",
    "our results are as follows :    * in the frequency range from p to s bands ( 0.32.2 ghz ) , 70% or more of the spectra in our grps are consistent with spls .",
    "we do not find a strong evidence that the majority of grps disagree with spl spectra .",
    "* for the grps whose spectra are consistent with spls , the spectral index is widely distributed from @xmath34 to @xmath1 . *",
    "the grp distributions in the fluences at p band and spectral index show a possible negative correlation .",
    "* for the l / s band grps which are not detected at p band , we carry out the stacking analysis of the p band light curve .",
    "we find significant enhancement in the p band light curves compared to the light curves in the non - grp periods .",
    "this indicates that those l / s - band grps accompany dim p - band grps .",
    "the average spectral indices for those samples , @xmath2 or @xmath35 , are harder than the bright grps .",
    "this supports the possible negative correlation between the p band flux and hardness . since the dim and hard grps ( group ( ii ) )",
    "occupy about a half of our grp samples , it might be suggested that most of grps may have intrinsically harder spectra than that suggested in the previous studies . * a positive correlation between the l / s band fluence and hardness",
    "considering the negative correlation at p band , our results suggest an anti - correlation between the total energy release and hardness .",
    "our monte carlo simulations to reproduce the distributions of the fluences and @xmath18 show that the typical spectral index is as hard as @xmath1 again . *",
    "we find several ultra - soft ( @xmath28 ) and ultra - hard ( @xmath29 ) grps . *",
    "a small fraction of spectra apparently deviate from spls .",
    "we do not find any tendency in the spectral shape for such grps .",
    "* several grps are detected in a very wide frequency range of @xmath36@xmath37 ghz .",
    "most of them need multiple spectral components .",
    "@xcite reported that the distribution of the spectral index is extremely wide ( from about @xmath38 to @xmath39 ) for a narrow frequency range of 1.3 - 1.45 ghz . in our observation",
    ", the fluences at the 4 channels in l band significantly fluctuate ( see appendix [ binning1 ] ) .",
    "if we fit such data with a spl , a similar result to @xcite may be obtained .",
    "such fluctuation might be intrinsic , or due to the scintillation modulation .",
    "it should be noticed that a large fraction of our broad band spectra do not conflict with spls from p to s bands .",
    "our broadband analysis seems more convincing than the results based on the narrow frequency range .",
    "@xcite investigated the spectral index between 0.6 and 1.4 ghz , and obtained their distribution ranging from @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "although the frequency range is slightly different , the index for group ( i ) is distributed within a similar range ( see figure [ alphahist - fludiv ] ) . @xcite investigated the spectral index between 0.2 and 1.4 ghz , and obtained their distribution ranging from @xmath4 to @xmath6 .",
    "however , the fluences at 1.4 ghz in @xcite are about 2 order of magnitude smaller than those in the previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are roughly consistent with our values , so that the results in @xcite should be reconsidered .",
    "our results suggest the anti - correlation between the total energy release and hardness .",
    "the emission mechanism for the broadband grps may be different from the anomalous cyclotron resonance model @xcite proposed for the characteristic property of the ipgrps above 4ghz @xcite , for which we did not detect the signal of the counterpart at p  s bands . in the induced scattering model @xcite",
    ", the intensity variation is attributed to the fluctuation of the optical depth to the induced scattering .",
    "@xcite suggested that the intensity amplification for the crab grps is more efficient at the lower frequencies , which agrees with the correlation we found .",
    "alternatively , a larger energy release may enhance the efficiency of the electron ",
    "positron pair production .",
    "the resultant high density pairs may screen out the electric field relatively soon , which may reduce the fraction of higher energy electrons / positrons . considering the unstable behavior of the magnetosphere as demonstrated by @xcite or @xcite , the above simple interpretation can be an option to explain the correlation . in any case , before jumping to a conclusion , we need to examine various non - linear processes in the grp activity such as the detailed properties of the charge bunching due to two stream instability @xcite and the photon softening due to the induced compton scattering ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "extremely bright grps from young pulsars are candidate of the emission process for frbs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the measured spectrum indices of frbs are from @xmath40 to @xmath41 @xcite , which are roughly consistent with that of crab grps .",
    "one exception is the repeating frb 121102 , whose range of the spectrum index is extremely wide , from @xmath42 to @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "although such hard and soft bursts may correspond to the ultra - hard and ultra - soft grps in our samples ( figure [ super ] ) , this wide range of the spectral index may be due to the narrow frequency range ( 1.21.5ghz ) in their observation .",
    "in fact , if we obtain the spectral index distribution from fluences in ll and lh bands , the range is from @xmath44 to @xmath45 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the wide frequency observations have the potential to provide unique limits on the spectral index distribution of frbs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the upcoming canadian hydrogen intensity mapping experiment ( chime , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will obtain a large number of frbs ( @xmath46 per day ) in a wide frequency range 400800 mhz .",
    "such observations ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* for frb search with vlbi ) can provide a great opportunity to probe the possible correlations between the spectral index and the fluence similar to the crab grps .",
    "considering the possible anti - correlation between the p band fluence and the l / s band fluences , there may exist a pivot frequency between p and l bands . in the pivot frequency",
    ", the fluence variation may be smaller than those in other bands .",
    "simultaneous observations at a frequency between p and l ( for example , @xmath47 ghz ) , and other frequencies may verify the correlation we found .    as for psr b1133 + 16 , each single pulse , not grp , can be detected .",
    "@xcite claimed that only the pulse at 4.85 ghz showed a large fluence fluctuation , while the fluences in other frequencies ( 0.34 , 0.63 , 1.41 ghz ) distributed below a few times the mean value .",
    "for the `` grp - like '' pulses at 4.85 ghz , @xcite found a positive correlation between the flux density at 4.85 ghz and the spectral index for the frequency range 0.344.85 ghz .",
    "their correlation is qualitatively similar to that we have found at l or s band .",
    "studies based on more spectra of grps or normal pulses from other pulsars are desired to compare with the results of the crab grps .",
    "since single pulses in a narrow band tend to be affected by the intensity modulation due to the interstellar scintillation , ultra - wideband observations with the next generation telescopes , such as ska , will be promising for such studies .",

    "a characteristic difficulty in our analysis arises from the very different duration timescales in p band and the other l / s bands . according to the phase distributions of the grp signals detected at both ll and p bands",
    ", we empirically established the method to determine the interval as follows .",
    "according to the method described in section [ grpsel ] , we search for grps at p  s bands . taking into account the different timescales in p and the other bands",

    "( 2 ) there are signals above the grp selection thresholds only in the p band data .      in the three bands , ll , lh , or s",
    ", we occasionally found a misaligned grp in different bands or a grp that has a long quiescent period between two pulses ( see e.g. figure [ sp1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we use all the light curves in the three bands to determine the time interval , which is commonly adopted for all the three bands . the fluences are calculated based on the 1@xmath30s time - bin data . from the 10@xmath30s time - bin light curves ,",
    "we first determine a tentative time interval as follows .",
    "when a grp is selected in some of the three bands , at least one time bin of s / n@xmath108 exists . in the three light curves , we search for a single time bin of s / n@xmath108 or multiple successive time bins of s / n@xmath109 .",
    "the time interval @xmath110 is defined as the minimal interval that contains all the above high s / n time bins .",
    "then , we generate the time series of the data with 1@xmath30s time - bin for all the three bands for the time interval @xmath111 . from those three data sets ,",
    "we define the bin numbers at which the first and last s / n@xmath112 signal appears as @xmath113 and @xmath114 , respectively . taking into account the time accuracy between the instruments ( @xmath115s ) ,",
    "we integrate the data over time bins from @xmath116 to @xmath117 to estimate the fluences or their upper limits for ll , lh , and s bands .    for p band ,",
    "the time series of the data is generated with 500@xmath30s time bin .",
    "since the grp duration in l / s band is short , the bin number @xmath118 corresponding to the l / s grp time is uniquely determined .",
    "when the highest s / n in the interval @xmath119 is below 4 , we set an upper limit of the fluence using the same interval .",
    "this time interval is based on the fact that 95% of p band grps have a duration shorter than @xmath120s . including the case that a p band grp is selected , when the highest s / n is above 4 , we set the highest bin as the starting point , and extend the interval back and forward as long as the successive time bin has s / n@xmath121 .",
    "this is because a strong p band grp tends to show a long tail in its light curve .",
    "we integrate over this time interval of s / n@xmath121 and estimate the fluence .      when a grp is selected at only p band , the method to determine the time interval for p band is the same as in the previous case .",
    "in this case , the highest signal in the other bands is below the selection threshold . in the duration of a p band grp",
    ", there are @xmath122 or more time bins in the ll , lh , and s band light curves of @xmath123s . in those large data sets",
    ", several time bins of s / n@xmath124 or 4 may appear as the statistical fluctuation .",
    "therefore , it is dangerous to search for a weak grp signal in such a long timescale . in this case",
    ", we set upper limits of the fluences at ll / lh / s bands . from all the three light curves of @xmath125s",
    ", we search for the highest s / n time bin . centering this time bin",
    ", we integrate the data over 30@xmath30s to obtain the upper limits .",
    "in our analysis , we synthesized the flux densities for l6l8 and s1s5 channels into lh and s bands , respectively .",
    "while the statistical errors in the synthesized flux are estimated with the standard manner taking into account the overlaps of the frequency intervals , the systematic error is evaluated by a sum of the systematic errors of the individual channels .",
    "the obtained errors become significantly small owing to the channel synthesis as shown in the central panel of figure [ bin ] . hereafter , this standard method is called `` method a '' , which is the method adopted in the analysis in the main text .",
    "the obtained fluences for the individual channels frequently show significant variations within their narrow frequency range as seen in the left panel of figure [ bin ] .",
    "as @xcite claimed , the fluence fluctuation in the narrow bands may be intrinsic property in the grp spectra similarly to the band spectral structure seen in @xcite .",
    "although the modulation due to the diffractive interstellar scintillation may be negligible at the channels in l and s bands as discussed in section [ 3band ] , the fluctuation may be the result of the unknown effects of the interstellar scintillation . in order to take into account this uncertainty ,",
    "we attempt another conservative method for the error estimate of the synthesized fluences , `` method b '' . in this method ,",
    "the actual fluence is assumed to be between the highest and the lowest values in the fluences for the channels in each band .",
    "the upper and lower limits in the fluence @xmath126 and @xmath127 are defined as follows , @xmath128 where @xmath129 and @xmath130 are the fluence and its @xmath131 error , respectively , at channel @xmath132 or s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 , s5 . in the method",
    "b , the representative fluence @xmath95 and its @xmath131 error @xmath133 are assumed as @xmath134 as shown in the right panel of figure [ bin ] , the method b leads to larger errors .",
    "when there is a channel with a fluence below @xmath135 , we set an upper - limit @xmath126 on the fluence . in this conservative method , even if a s / n value for the synthesized channel is above the selection threshold , there are cases that just the upper - limit is set on the synthesized fluence .",
    "therefore , some fraction of grps detected with the method a are judged as non - detection .",
    "the sample number in the method b becomes slightly smaller than that in the method a ( compare tables [ tcatmp ] and [ tcatmp - binning1 ] ) .",
    "when we use the data generated with the method b in the spectral analysis , 95.6% of mpgrps and 97.0% of ipgrps are judged to be consistent with spls at a significance level of 5% ( see table [ tcatmp - binning1 ] ) .",

    ", we generate pseudo grp samples whose fluence distribution at ll band follows the power - law with index -2.98 as observed ( see table [ tfluenceindex ] ) above @xmath139jy  @xmath30s .",
    "the suppression in the lower fluence region ( `` roll - over '' feature ) seen in the distributions shown in figure [ fig : fluencedistribution ] may be due to the decline of the detection efficiency . the detection efficiency in the lower fluence region for each band",
    "is determined to reproduce the roll - over shape . for each pseudo grp",
    ", we obtain @xmath18 following a distribution assumed in advance , independently of @xmath25 .",
    "the fluence at other bands is calculated with the obtained @xmath25 and @xmath18 .",
    "we judge detection of the pseudo grps taking into account the detection efficiency at each frequency band , and then categorize the grps into the groups described in section [ cate ] .",
    "the grp sample generation continues until the number of grps detected at both p and ll bands reaches 271 , which is the number of grps detected at both p and ll bands in our observation samples . since",
    "248 grps ( samples in figure [ real ] ) are judged to be consistent with a spl , we randomly extract 248 grps from the 271 pseudo samples .",
    "we perform such trials @xmath140 times for a certain distribution of @xmath18 .",
    "first , we test a uniform distribution from @xmath141 to @xmath142 , and a gaussian distribution with the mean value @xmath143 , which is close to that for the normal pulse ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the standard deviation @xmath144 . for those models ,",
    "examples of the scatter plots obtained from one of the trials are shown in figure [ alphagaus ] . apparently , the distributions seem different from the observed one .",
    "we calculate the spearman rank correlation coefficient @xmath145 for those 248 pseudo samples in each trial , but none of the trials reaches @xmath146 , the value for the actual group ( i ) grps ( see figure [ rhist ] ) . the uniform distribution and @xmath143 are excluded .",
    "however , if the typical index is harder than that for the normal pulse , only a small fraction of dim grps at ll band is soft enough to be detected at p band . here",

    "this model overpredicts the number of the grps detected at only s band .",
    "many hard grps ( @xmath148 ) contribute to those s band grps .",
