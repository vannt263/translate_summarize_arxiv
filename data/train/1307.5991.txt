    "<S> iron - chalcogenide compounds with fese(te , s ) layers did not attract much attention until the discovery of high-@xmath0 superconductivity ( sc ) in the iron - pnictide compounds at the begining of 2008 . compared with feas - based superconductors , </S>",
    "<S> iron - chalcogenide superconductors have aroused enormous enthusiasm to study the relationship between sc and magnetisms with several distinct features , such as different antiferromagnetic ground states with relatively large moments in the parents , indicating possibly different superconducting mechanisms , the existence of the excess fe atoms or fe vacancies in the crystal lattice . </S>",
    "<S> another reason is that the large single crystals are easily grown for the iron - chalcogenide compounds . </S>",
    "<S> this review will focus on our exploration for the iron - chalcogenide superconductors and discussion on several issues , including the crystal structure , magnetic properties , superconductivity , and phase separation . </S>",
    "<S> some of them reach a consensus but some important questions still remain to be answered .    </S>",
