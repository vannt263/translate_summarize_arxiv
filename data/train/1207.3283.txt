    "this underscores the need to observe at longer , rest - frame near - ultraviolet wavelengths if emission from the host galaxy is to be differentiated from surrounding gas .",
    "imaging quasar host galaxies allows one to examine how mergers , starbursts , and other changes in environment affect the central nucleus .",
    "observations of molecular gas and the far - infrared continua of @xmath11 quasars have suggested extremely high average star formation rates of @xmath16  @xmath17  yr@xmath18 @xcite , implying potentially luminous hosts .",
    "as many quasars are hosted in massive galaxies , imaging @xmath11 quasar hosts may reveal the properties of the most massive first galaxies .",
    "the enormous smbh mass ( @xmath19  @xmath17 ) associated with sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ? * ) quasars at @xmath11 represents a great theoretical challenge that heavily constrains possible formation methods and merger histories @xcite .",
    "sdss j114816.64 + 525150.3 ( hereafter j1148 + 5251 ) , is the best - studied member of the @xmath11 quasar population , having been extensively observed at multiple wavelengths since its discovery by @xcite .",
    "near - infrared spectroscopy by @xcite and @xcite measured the and features , estimating a mass of @xmath20  @xmath17 for the smbh , an accretion rate near the eddington limit , and an / ratio consistent with quasars at lower redshifts .",

    "studies of the [ ] line at @xmath24 @xcite provide evidence that the quasar host galaxy is undergoing a vigorous starburst , with an estimated star formation rate density of @xmath25  yr@xmath18  kpc@xmath7 extending over kiloparsec scales .",
    "studies of the continuum emission at far - infrared ( fir ) wavelengths indicate a warm dust component with an agn - corrected fir luminosity of @xmath26  @xmath27 @xcite and corresponding dust mass of @xmath28  @xmath17 @xcite .",

    "mid - infrared spitzer space telescope observations by @xcite show clear evidence for prominent hot dust within the galaxy .",
    "all of these observations argue for a host galaxy with a significant stellar mass component undergoing an extreme episode of star formation .    in this letter",
    ", we report on near - infrared imaging of j1148 + 5251 with the hst wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) and our methods for characterizing and subtracting the instrument and telescope point spread function ( psf ) . in  [ sect : obs ] , we describe our near - infrared wfc3 imaging of j1148 + 5251 and a nearby star , used for psf characterization . in  [ sect : psfsubtraction ] , we describe our method for subtracting the central point source from the quasar images .",
    "we describe our simulations for assessing the reliability of our subtraction method in  [ sect : sims ] .",
    "finally , in  [ sect : discussion ] , we discuss the implications of these results and our plans for future investigation . for this paper , we adopt a @xmath30cdm cosmology with @xmath31  km  s@xmath18  mpc@xmath18 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "unless otherwise stated , all magnitudes use the ab system @xcite and have been corrected for galactic extinction using the map of @xcite .",
    "the hst observations of j1148 + 5251 were performed on 2011 january 31 ( hst program i d 12332 , pi : r. windhorst ) using the wfc3 ir channel with the f125w ( wide j ) and f160w ( wfc3 h ) filters .",
    "previous programs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) found that the quality of empirical quasar point source subtractions was significantly affected by psf time variability .",
    "this variability is mostly due to so - called `` spacecraft breathing '' effects , i.e.,thermally induced defocus of the hst secondary mirror due to movement of the optical telescope assembly as the telescope goes into and out of earth shadow ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "examining these studies and instrument reports , we identified two primary sources of thermal variation that we expected to affect our observations  the spacecraft attitude and the orbital day - night cycle .",
    "to minimize thermal variations due to spacecraft attitude , we constrained our psf star to be within 5@xmath34  of the target quasar , and required that the quasar and psf star observations be collected in contiguous orbits .",
    "we further requested ( and were granted ) that our observations be scheduled immediately following another observation near the same celestial coordinates , thus minimizing thermal equilibration time in our first orbit .",
    "we selected the psf star to match the quasar near - infrared colors ( @xmath35  vega  mag , @xmath36  vega  mag ) as closely as possible , to minimize differences in wavelength - dependent psf features .",
    "many stars with colors similar to the quasar also have sdss spectra , since they were targeted by sdss as high - redshift quasar candidates .",
    "we examined these spectra where available , to reject obvious spectroscopic binaries or other contaminants . after checking the resulting candidate stars for hst guide stars",
    ", we selected the star 2mass  j11552259 + 4937342 ( spectral type k7 , @xmath37  vega  mag , @xmath38  vega  mag , @xmath39  vega  mag , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as our final psf target .",
    "unfortunately , there is no way to eliminate thermal variation due to the orbital day / night cycle .",
    "thus , we constructed our orbits to ensure that we fully sampled this cycle , and that equal fractions of the final , combined quasar and psf star images would come from any given location in orbital phase .",
    "each quasar exposure was matched by several shorter psf star exposures , taken at the same sub - pixel dither point at the same phase within the orbit .",
    "this phase - space sampling is summarized in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : subtractreal ] .",
    "any given detector location was never exposed beyond half - well depth in a single orbit , thus avoiding saturation or detector persistence .",
    "the quasar was observed in this pattern for three orbits in total , and the psf star was observed for a single orbit .",
    "the total exposure times for each object and filter combination are summarized in table  [ tab : exptimes ] .",
    "analysis was performed on ` multidrizzle`-combined images @xcite with an output pixel scale of 0065 , to achieve nyquist sampling of the psf core in both filters , enabling accurate spatial shifting .",
    "the cosmic ray rejection step of ` multidrizzle ` was disabled , since the wfc3 ir ` multiaccum ` readout mode provided sufficient cosmic ray rejection .",

    "to subtract the quasar point source , we used the program ` galfit ` @xcite to fit a psf single - component model to the quasar image .",
    "we transformed the ` multidrizzle`-generated weight maps into uncertainty maps as in @xcite , including the effects of correlated noise and shot noise from the quasar , and supplied these to ` galfit ` as the pixel - to - pixel uncertainty ( `` sigma '' ) image .",
    "we then subtracted the best - fit model from the original image , and inspected the residual .",
    "we first attempted this subtraction using the image of our psf star as the model psf .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : subtractreal ] .",
    "we measured the residuals using a 05 radius aperture , obtaining upper limits of @xmath1  mag , @xmath2  mag ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this includes the total noise contribution from both the quasar and the empirical psf , measured by scaling the psf uncertainty map by the same factor as in the fit , and adding it in quadrature to the quasar uncertainty map .",
    "the noise contribution from the subtracted psf is comparable to that of the quasar since the two images have comparable @xmath40 ( see table  [ tab : exptimes ] ) , which leads to cosmetic defects ( holes ) in the subtraction , despite the net positive residual .",
    "we also generated a ` tinytim ` @xcite model of the psf , which we calibrated to the the psf star observations .",
    "a @xmath41 spatially oversampled ` tinytim ` model was generated for each wfc3 exposure to allow for subpixel shifting .",
    "we used the spectrum of j1148 + 5251 obtained by @xcite as our model spectrum .",
    "we used the hst focus model @xcite to estimate the secondary mirror despace for each exposure , and included the field - dependent coma and astigmatism measurements built into ` tinytim ` .",
    "the individual hst detectors have different mean focus offsets in the focus model , but the offset for the wfc3 ir channel has not been characterized .",
    "we therefore allowed the mean @xmath42 zernike coefficient in ` tinytim ` ( @xmath43 in the original formulation of * ? ? ? * ) to float as a free parameter in our optimization , adding this single mean value to the focus model estimate for each exposure .",
    "these models for individual exposures were then combined , weighted by exposure time , to produce a composite psf for each ` multidrizzle`-combined science image . `",
    "galfit ` also accepts a pixel response convolution kernel for oversampled psfs .",
    "we generated this quantity in a similar manner , by drizzling copies of the empirical wfc3 pixel response convolution kernel ( modeling inter - pixel capacitance and jitter , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) using the same shifts applied to the real images .",
    "the result of the ` tinytim ` psf subtraction , with a significantly reduced noise floor compared to the direct subtraction , is shown in figure  [ fig : subtract ] .",

    "the inner 03 was excluded from the fit , as the best - fit ` tinytim ` models produce psf cores that are consistently narrower than those observed .",
    "visible residuals ( diffraction spikes and spots ) are also seen when subtracting this model from the psf star observations .",
    "having established no host galaxy detection using the ` tinytim ` psf , we sought to quantify this subtraction method s ability to recover the host galaxy flux as a function of host galaxy parameters .",
    "to do so , we used ` galfit ` to simulate a point source along with a srsic profile host galaxy , with total flux adding up to @xmath48  mag , the measured flux in f125w .",
    "this simulated image contained no noise , so we added both shot noise from the object and a gaussian noise field drizzled in the same manner as the real quasar image , to match its correlated noise properties .",
    "we then performed the same analysis that we used on the real quasar image , using ` galfit ` to subtract a ` tinytim`-generated point source and measuring the surface brightness from @xmath44 to @xmath45 in the residual image .",
    "we ran a grid of 256 models using this technique , varying the total integrated flux of the host galaxy from @xmath49  mag , the effective radius from @xmath50 , and srsic indexes @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the magnitude range represents host galaxies with luminosities from @xmath53 to @xmath54 of the total quasar luminosity .",

    ", we also found that bright ( @xmath60  mag ) , compact ( @xmath61 ) host galaxies would cause the method to significantly over - subtract the psf .",
    "this would show negative residuals from the diffraction spikes , which are not seen in figure  [ fig : subtract ] .     as a function of simulated host galaxy parameters .",
