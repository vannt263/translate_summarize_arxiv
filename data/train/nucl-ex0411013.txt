    "the first evidence of the observation of a pentaquark @xmath0 particle came in early 2003 from the leps collaboration  @xcite in which a sharp resonance was reported at a mass of @xmath4 ( gev)/c@xmath5 . the diana collaboration  @xcite reported evidence for a resonance enhancement at @xmath6 mev / c@xmath5 and @xmath7 mev / c@xmath5 in the charge - exchange reaction @xmath8 . the clas collaboration  @xcite reported a statistical significance of @xmath9 at the @xmath10 invariant mass peak of @xmath11 mev / c@xmath5 with a measured width of 21 mev for the reaction @xmath12 .",
    "the saphir  @xcite collaboration reported a peak at @xmath13 mev ( 4.8 @xmath14 confidence level ) and an upper limit of 25 mev for the width with a @xmath15 confidence level in the @xmath16 invariant mass distribution from the @xmath17 process .",
    "the saphir collaboration also reported the absence of a signal in the @xmath18 invariant mass distribution in the @xmath19 reaction .",
    "more recently , the hermes collaboration  @xcite reported evidence of the @xmath0 particle from a deuterium target with the decay mode @xmath20 at @xmath21 ( mev ) with a width of 7.5 mev dominated by detector resolution",
    ". the clas collaboration  @xcite also reported evidence on @xmath0 from a hydrogen target from the @xmath22 process .",
    "they found a peak in the invariant mass of @xmath23 at 1555 mev with a width of about 26 mev .",
    "the cern na49 collaboration  @xcite reported an exotic @xmath24 baryon resonance in proton - proton collisions with a mass of @xmath25 mev / c@xmath5 and width below the detector resolution of 18 mev / c@xmath5 in the @xmath26 , and @xmath27 invariant mass spectra .",
    "these two states are believed to be candidates for the @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , and the @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) pentaquark state , respectively . however , there is probably more evidence against the existence of the @xmath28 and @xmath30 pentaquark states  @xcite .",
    "mostly recently , the h1 collaboration reported  @xcite evidence for a narrow anti - charmed baryon state , interpreting such a state as the pentaquark @xmath32 state .    in summary , the experimental situation concerning the @xmath0 and @xmath3 pentaquark states is the following .",
    "there is evidence from different experiments supporting the existence of the pentaquark @xmath0 state , but there is no evidence for the @xmath3 particle .",
    "the mass of the @xmath0 particle is from 1527 mev to 1555 mev , and the width is found to be from 9 mev to 26 mev limited by detector resolutions . also , the existing data seem to suggest that the @xmath0 particle is an isoscalar particle . however , the existence of @xmath33 pentaquark is far from being confirmed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "one also needs to address possible experimental issues such as kinematic reflection  @xcite due to the decay of higher mass mesons , such as the @xmath34 , the @xmath35 , and the @xmath36 .",
    "the original chiral soliton model  @xcite predicted a mass of 1530 mev and a total width of less than 15 mev for the @xmath0 particle .",
    "it also predicted that the @xmath0 particle is a spin @xmath37 isoscalar particle and the predicted mass for the @xmath38 state is 2070 mev . in the correlated diquark picture by jaffe and wilczek  @xcite ,",
    "the diquarks qq are correlated in an antisymmetric color , flavor and spin state . in the case of the @xmath0 pentaquark state",
    ", it is a bound state of two highly correlated @xmath39 pairs and an antiquark .",
    "the narrowness of the width of the @xmath0 particle can be explained in this model by the weak coupling between the @xmath10 continuum and the bound state of the two diquark pairs and the antiquark , @xmath40^{2}\\bar{s}$ ] .",
    "one of the interesting predictions from this model , which differs from the chiral soliton model prediction , is the mass of the cascade isospin @xmath41 multiple @xmath42 ^ 2\\bar{d})$ ] .",
    "it is predicted to be around 1750 mev with a width about @xmath43 greater than that of the @xmath0 particle .",
    "the @xmath0 particle was also hypothesized as an isotensor resonance to explain the observed narrow width of the @xmath0 particle  @xcite via isospin - violating strong decays .",
    "the hypothesis that @xmath0 is an isotensor particle implies the existence of @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 states .",
    "gerasyuta and kochkin  @xcite calculated the mass spectra of the isotensor theta - pentaquarks with @xmath48 in a relativistic quark model .",
    "the predicted mass for @xmath45 is 1575 mev ( 1761 mev ) for @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "here we following the convention in the literature that @xmath51 represents the i=0 state in anti - decuplet , @xmath52 represents the i=1 state in 27-plet and @xmath53 the i=2 state in 35-plet . in the remaining of the paper",
    ", we will not explicitly differentiate the @xmath45 and the @xmath54 states because the proposed experiment will not be able to determine which multiplet the observed @xmath3 particle belongs to .",
    "walliser and kopeliovich  @xcite investigated the implications of the @xmath0 exotic pentaquark for the baryon spectrum in topological soliton models .",
    "they estimate the positions of other pentaquark and septuquark states with exotic and with non - exotic quantum numbers , particularly within the 27-plet baryon and the 35-plet multiplets in su(3 ) soliton model . in the 27-plet",
    ", the @xmath55 multiple ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath54 ) are estimated to have a mass of 1.65 to 1.69 gev .",
    "most recently , wu and ma  @xcite studied the mass and width of the pentaquark @xmath52 states in the 27 baryon multiplet from chiral soliton model .",
    "their calculations show that the mass of @xmath52 is about 1.61 gev and the width for the process @xmath58 is less than 44 mev .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite constructed a complete classification of @xmath59 states in terms of the flavor - spin su(6 ) representation and found that only the anti - decuplet , 27-plets and the 35-plets contain exotic states which can not be constructed by three quarks only . in this model ,",
    "the ground state pentaquark is identified as the observed @xmath60 state , and is predicted to be an isosinglet anti - decuplet state .",
    "the predicted masses for the excited exotic baryons are 1660 mev and 1775 mev .    while it is important to determine the quantum number of the @xmath0 particle , particularly the spin and the parity and to search for other members in the exotic baryon family , it is more essential to confirm the existence of the @xmath0 particle with significantly improved statistics , and to determine its mass and the width more precisely .",
    "karliner and lipkin  @xcite derived an upper bound on the mass difference between the @xmath61 and @xmath0 based on simple assumptions about @xmath62 symmetry breaking and quantum mechanical variational method .",
    "the resulting rather robust bound is more than 20 mev below the experimentally reported @xmath61 - @xmath0 mass difference .",
    "it is also very important to verify definitely the non - existence or the existence of the @xmath3 particle and to search for the @xmath54 particle .",
    "mass spectra for the proposed experiment . in this",
    "simulation , physical events were generated from the @xmath63 process with a @xmath33 mass of 1540 mev ; the background is from @xmath64 pairs and an accidental coincidental rate .",

    ", a liquid deuterium target will be used for the @xmath69 process .",
    "the @xmath70 particle will be detected in the short orbit spectrometer ( sos ) in coincidence with the @xmath71 and the neutron which will be detected in the high resolution kaon spectrometer ( hks ) , and the neutron counter , respectively . by detecting all three particles , the untagged bremsstrahlung photon energy ,",
    "the mass of the @xmath0 particle , and the initial neutron momentum inside the deuteron can be reconstructed completely .",
    "for the two - body process @xmath72 process one can not reconstruct the mass of the undetected @xmath3 ( @xmath54 ) particle from detecting @xmath70 particle only unless the energy of the incident real photon is known .",
    "assuming the @xmath73 particle decays into @xmath71 and @xmath74 , the incident real photon energy can be reconstructed by detecting @xmath71 in coincidence with the @xmath70 particle .",
    "such coincidence detection also suppresses backgrounds from other physical processes which have final states different from the @xmath75 final state .",
    "the proposed experiment allows for the search of the @xmath3 ( @xmath54 ) particle in the mass range of 1500 mev to 1800 mev .",
    "the primary sources of the physics backgrounds for the proposed @xmath67 process and the @xmath78 process are : ( i ) @xmath79 meson production , ( ii ) @xmath80 where , @xmath81 , and ( iii ) three - body final state @xmath82 production .",
    "monte carlo simulations have been carried out to study these backgrounds , taking into account the momentum and angular resolutions of the two hadron spectrometers and their full momentum and angular acceptances . the spectrometer momentum and angle settings based on the two - body kinematics of the @xmath67 and the @xmath69 processes together with the reconstructed photon energy cut ( @xmath83 mev ) , where @xmath84 is the incident electron beam energy , effectively suppress the background contributions from the aforementioned physical processes .",
    "cuts can be applied in the invariant mass of the @xmath85 ( @xmath16 ) system in order to suppress these backgrounds further .",
    "simulations show that both the @xmath79 production and the @xmath86 channels are suppressed even without a 100 mev of @xmath87 cut and kinematic reflections are not issues for the proposed experiment . fig .",
    "[ fig : thetaplus ] shows the projected result on the @xmath0 particle search .",
    "the @xmath76 reaction will be used for the mass calibration .",
    "the @xmath88 particle will be reconstructed by its decay into neutron and @xmath89 particle .",
    "the neutron will be detected in the neutron counter in coincidence with the @xmath89 , and the mass of the @xmath88 particle will be reconstructed in a similar way as that of the @xmath0 particle . to suppress the background the @xmath71 particle will be detected in the sos spectrometer in coincidence with the neutron and the @xmath89 particle .",
    "[ fig : calibration ] shows the simulated @xmath88 particle mass determination , which is better than 0.3 mev .",
    "the upper panel shows the simulation result for the @xmath76 , @xmath77 reaction only , while the lower panel result includes accidental and other possible physical backgrounds .",
