    "from the famous einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) paradox  @xcite to bell s seminal discovery  @xcite , quantum theory has never failed to surprise us with its plethora of intriguing phenomena and mind - boggling applications  @xcite . among those who made the bizarre nature of quantum theory evident was schrdinger , who not only coined the term  entanglement \" , but also pointed out that quantum theory allows for _ steering _",
    "@xcite : through the act of local measurements on one - half of an entangled state , a party can _ remotely _ steer the set of ( conditional ) quantum states accessible by the other party .    taking a quantum information perspective , the demonstration of steering can be viewed as the verification of entanglement involving an untrusted party  @xcite .",
    "imagine that two parties alice and bob share some quantum state and alice wants to convince bob that the shared state is entangled , but bob does not trust her . if alice can convince bob that the shared state indeed exhibits epr steering , then bob would be convinced that they share entanglement , as the latter is a prerequisite for steering .",
    "note , however , that shared entanglement is generally insufficient to guarantee steerability .",
    "interestingly , steerability is actually a necessary but generally insufficient condition for the demonstration of bell - nonlocality  @xcite .",
    "hence , steering represents a form of quantum inseparability in between entanglement and bell - nonlocality .",
    "apart from entanglement verification in a partially - trusted scenario , steering has also found applications in the distribution of secret keys in partially trusted scenario  @xcite . from a resource perspective , the steerability of a quantum state @xmath0 , i.e. , whether @xmath0 is steerable and the extent to which it can exhibit steering turns out to provide also an indication for the usefulness of @xmath0 in other quantum information processing tasks .",
    "for instance , steerability as quantified by steering robustness  @xcite is monotonously related to the probability of success in the problem of subchannel discrimination when one is restricted to local measurements aided by one - way communications",
    ".    the characterization of quantum states that are capable of exhibiting steering and the quantification of steerability are thus of relevance not just from a fundamental viewpoint , but also in quantum information .",
    "surprisingly , very little is known in terms of which quantum state is ( un)steerable ( see , however ,  @xcite ) . here , we derive some generic sufficient conditions for steerability that can be applied to quantum state of arbitrary hilbert space dimensions .",
    "importantly , in contrast to conventional approach of steering inequalities  @xcite where an optimization over the many measurements that can be performed by each party is needed , our criteria only requires the relatively straightforward computation of the fully entangled fraction  @xcite .",
    "given that some entangled quantum state @xmath0 can not exhibit steering  @xcite , a natural question that arises is whether the steerability of such a state can be _ superactivated _ by allowing joint measurements on multiple copies of @xmath0 .",
    "in other words , is it possible that some @xmath0 that is not steerable becomes steerable if local measurements are performed instead on @xmath1 for some large enough @xmath2 ?",
    "building on some recent results established for bell - nonlocality  @xcite , we provide here an affirmative answer to the above question .",
    "note that even for a quantum state @xmath0 that is steerable , it is interesting to investigate how their steerability scales with the number of copies .",
    "for instance , is it possible to amplify the amount of steering - inequality violation by an _ arbitrarily large _",
    "amount if only a small number of copies is available ( see  @xcite for analogous works in the context of bell - nonlocality ) ?",
    "again , we provide a positive answer to this question , showing that an unbounded amount of amplification can be obtained by allowing joint measurements on as few as three copies of a quantum state that is barely steerable , or even unsteerable under projective measurements .",
    "the rest of this paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : prelim ] , we give a brief overview on some of the basic notions in bell - nonlocality and epr steering that we will need in subsequent discussions .",
    "there , inspired by the work of cavalcanti _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , we also introduce the notion of _ steering fraction _ and _ largest ( steering - inequality ) violation _ , which are crucial quantities that lead to many of the findings mentioned above .",
    "for instance , in section  [ sec : characterization ] , we use these quantities to derive ( 1 ) a general sufficient condition for an arbitrary quantum state @xmath0 to be steerable and ( 2 ) upper bounds on the largest steering - inequality violation of an arbitrary finite - dimensional maximally entangled state as a function of its hilbert space dimension @xmath3",
    ". quantification of steerability using a strengthened version of steering fraction is discussed in section  [ sec : quantifysteering ]  there , we also demonstrate how this novel steering monotone  @xcite is related to the others , such as the steerable weight  @xcite and steering robustness  @xcite . in section  [ sec : superampli ]",
    ", we show the superactivation of steerablity , provide a procedure to construct a steering inequality for this purpose , and demonstrate unbounded amplification of steerability .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclude ] with a discussion and some opened problems for future research .",

    "this , however , is still not enough to guarantee that the given isotropic state @xmath247 is unsteerable under general povms due to the lack of exact characterization of steerability under general povms .",

    "let us first remind that the largest bell - inequality violation under projective measurements is upper bounded by the upper bound given in eq .",
    "[ see eq .  ] .",
    "next , note that the lower bound on steering fraction that we have presented in eq",

    "in this paper , we have introduced the tool of steering fraction @xmath280 and used it to establish novel results spanning across various dimensions of the phenomenon of quantum steering .",
    "below , we briefly summarize these results and comment on some possibilities for future research .",
    "firstly , we have derived a general sufficient condition for _ any _ bipartite quantum state @xmath0 to be steerable ( bell - nonlocal ) in terms of its fully entangled fraction , a quantity closely related to the usefulness of @xmath0 for teleportation  @xcite . as we briefly discussed in section",
    "[ sec : characterization ] , we do not expect these sufficient conditions to detect all steerable ( bell - nonlocal ) states .",
    "nonetheless , let us stress that to determine if a quantum state is steerable ( as with determining if a quantum state can exhibit bell - nonlocality , see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) is a notoriously difficult problem , which often requires the optimization over the many parameters used to describe the measurements involved in a steering experiment ( and/or the consideration of potentially infinitely many different steering inequalities ) .",
    "in contrast , the general criterion that we have presented in theorem  [ thm : sufficentsteerability ] for steerability ( and theorem  [ theorem : suff_condi_nonlocality ] for bell - nonlocality ) only requires a relatively straightforward computation of the fully entangled fraction of the state of interest .",
    "given that these sufficient conditions are likely to be suboptimal , an obvious question that follows is whether one can find an explicit threshold @xmath281 that is smaller than that given by theorem  [ thm : sufficentsteerability ] ( theorem  [ theorem : suff_condi_nonlocality ] ) such that @xmath282 still guarantees steerability ( bell - nonlocality ) .",
    "while this may seem like a difficult problem , recent advances  @xcite in the algorithmic construction of local hidden - variable ( -state ) models may shed some light on this .",
    "more generally , it will be interesting to know if our sufficient condition can be strengthened while preserving its computability",
    ". in particular , it will be very useful to find analogous steerability ( bell - nonlocality ) criteria that are tight .",
    "on the other hand , the aforementioned sufficient condition has also enabled us to derive upper bounds  as functions of @xmath3on the largest steering - inequality violation @xmath102 ( @xmath283 ) achievable by the maximally entangled state @xmath76 under general povms ( projective measurements ) . in particular , using the general connection between @xmath102 and the largest bell - inequality violation , @xmath284 , established in appendix  [ app : bell ] , our upper bounds on @xmath102 and @xmath283 imply upper bounds on @xmath284 and @xmath285 by @xmath76 ( for non - negative * b * ) , respectively .",
    "notably , our upper bound on @xmath285 is somewhat tighter than that due to palazuelos  @xcite .",
    "if any strengthened sufficient conditions for steerability , as discussed above , are found , it would also be interesting to see if they could lead to tighter ( non - asymptotic ) upper bound(s ) on the largest steering - inequality ( and/or bell - inequality ) violation attainable by @xmath76 .    the tool of steering fraction @xmath280 , in addition , can be used to quantify steerability . in particular",
    ", we showed that if @xmath280 is optimized over all ( non - negative ) * f * , the resulting quantity can be cast as a _ convex steering monotone _",
    "@xcite which we referred to as the _ optimal steering fraction _ @xmath158 .",
    "we further demonstrated how this monotone is quantitatively related to two other convex steering monotones  steerable weight  @xcite and steering robustness  @xcite . in the light of quantum information , it would be desirable to determine an operational meaning of @xmath158 , e.g. , in the context of some quantum information tasks ( cf .",
    "steering robustness  @xcite ) .",
    "establishment of quantitative relations between @xmath158 and other convex steering monotones , such as the relative entropy of steering  @xcite , would certainly be very welcome .",
    "in particular , it would be highly desirable to establish quantitative relations that allow one to estimate @xmath158 from other easily - computable steering monotones , such as the steerable weight , or the steering robustness .    using the established sufficient condition for steerability",
    ", we have also demonstrated the superactivation of steerability , i.e. , the phenomenon that certain unsteerable quantum state @xmath0 becomes , for sufficiently large @xmath2 , steerable when joint _",
    "local _ measurements on @xmath1 are allowed .",
    "a drawback of the examples that we have presented here is that they inherit directly from the superactivation of bell - nonlocality due to palazuelos  @xcite and cavalcanti _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "an obvious question that follows is whether one can construct explicit examples for the superactivation of steerability using quantum states whose bell - nonlocality _ can not _ be superactivated via joint measurements .",
    "one the other hand , with joint local measurements , we showed that the steering - inequality ( bell - inequality ) violation of certain barely steerable ( bell - nonlocal ) @xmath0 [ or even unsteerable ( bell - local ) with projective measurements ] can be arbitrarily amplified , in particular , giving an arbitrarily large steering - inequality ( bell - inequality ) violation with @xmath286 .",
    "could such unbounded amplification be achieved using joint measurements on two copies of the same state ?",
    "our proof technique , see eq .",
