    "the regge action for the tetrahedron is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the angle between the outward normals of two faces sharing the @xmath8-th edge . if we assign non - negative half - integer values @xmath9 to the edges such that @xmath10 ( or @xmath11 if @xmath12 ) and the three @xmath13 s around every face satisfy triangle relations ( i.e. @xmath14 ; in this paper , a non - negative half - integer means an element of the set @xmath15 . ) , then the 6j - symbol @xmath16 is non - zero and approximates the cosine of the regge action in the large @xmath13 limit .",
    "the positive frequency part of the cosine function is the integrand of the partition function of quantum ( euclidean ) general relativity ( up to some subtleties concerning the imaginary unit @xmath17 ) in the pathintegral formalism .",
    "based on this observation , ponzano and regge constructed a",

    "@xcite proved that the value of the partition function of this model is independent of the choice of the tetrahedral triangulation of 3-manifold .",
    "from this fact it could be said that the partition function of this model is invariant under the renormalization group transformation and depends only on the topology of the manifold .",
    "this could be an indication that the model is related to some continuum quantum theory .    by constructing a hilbert space of state functionals on a 2-space formed and triangulated by the faces of the tetrahedra in the simplex manifold , ooguri @xcite showed that this model is isomorphic to witten s canonical formulation of @xmath18 chern - simons theory @xcite , which is known to be equivalent to the ashtekar formulation of general relativity in @xmath0-dimensions @xcite .",

    "these facts suggest that this model may contain some essential information of @xmath0 quantum gravity .",

    "in fact , what will be done in this paper is the following .",
    "we present a partition function which is a sum of products of terms .",
    "each of the terms is a simple combination of variables associated with a vertex , an edge , a face or a tetrahedron of a fixed simplex lattice in a fixed 3-manifold .",
    "the values of these variables are determined by simple geometrical relations between the simplex lattice and a family of surfaces .",
    "the computations needed in the evaluation of this partition function are very simple combinatorial ones in contrast to the case for the ponzano - regge partition function , which includes also combinatrial but quite complicated computations of 6j - symbols in addition to their unclear geometrical meaning .",
    "nevertheless , this partition function is shown to be equivalent to the ponzano - regge partition function .",
    "secondly , the regulator introduced by ponzano and regge to regulate divergences appearing in the partition function is reconstructed by means of the variables defined by geometrical relations between the simplex lattice and a family of surfaces and shown to have a geometrical meaning although the regulator was originally constructed algebraically by ponzano and regge .",
