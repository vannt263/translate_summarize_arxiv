    "it was realized many years ago @xcite that in the large n limit of yang - mills theory a remarkable simplification takes place : the physics is dominated by `` planar '' graphs , feynman diagrams with no line - crossings . in this limit , the gauge theory ought to be described by a `` qcd string , '' and it was a hope that such a simplification might shed light on some of the mysteries of nonabelian gauge theories , notably the puzzle of confinement .    the ads / cft correspondence @xcite makes explicit this relation between gauge fields and strings .",
    "specifically , the correspondence says that iib string theory in a background of five - dimensional anti - de sitter space times a five - sphere is dual to the large n limit of @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills theory in four dimensions .",
    "this is a conformal theory with no confinement ; however , the thermal theory in finite volume could still have a confined phase .",
    "an important ingredient in the correspondence is the principle of holography @xcite , the notion that the physics of a gravitational theory is dual to a different theory in one lower dimension .",
    "conversely , given the dual theory on a boundary , we must consider all the possible bulk manifolds whose boundaries have the same intrinsic geometry as the background of the dual theory @xcite .",
    "for thermal super yang - mills on @xmath1 , there are at least two distinct einstein manifolds with the requisite boundary geometry : thermal anti - de sitter space and a schwarzschild - like black hole in ads @xcite .",
    "these classical bulk solutions are a sort of master field of the gauge theory .",
    "the distinct geometries are interpreted in the gauge theory as different phases in the strong t hooft coupling limit ; the thermodynamics of the black hole corresponds to the thermodynamics of strong - coupling sym in the unconfined phase while thermal ads is seen as dual to the confined phase of the gauge theory .    in this paper , we investigate the thermodynamics of the different phases of super yang - mills at finite volume on @xmath1 using the ads / cft correspondence . in particular , we examine the conditions for phase change in a microcanonical framework .",
    "formally , a phase transition can not occur in finite volume at finite n. however , a crossover between these qualitatively different phases can still occur when their weights in the partition sum are the same . in the dual picture",
    ", the black hole dominates the path integral when the horizon is large compared to the inverse ads curvature , and the thermal ads geometry dominates for sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "the crossover between these two geometries is known as the hawking - page transition and corresponds in the field theory to a transition between the confining and unconfined phases .",
    "since a microcanonical framework requires that energy be conserved during any transition , we shall consider not empty ads with thermal identifications , but rather thermally - identified ads with a thermal gas in it .",
    "the energy of the system is then measured with respect to the thermal ads background .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "we begin , in section ii , by reviewing the thermal properties of ads black holes and their interpretation in light of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "then , in section iii , we consider a thermal bath in ads .",
    "finally , in section iv , we determine the necessary conditions for a crossover between the black hole and radiation - dominated phases .",
    "the five - dimensional einstein - hilbert action with a cosmological constant is given by i_bh = -1 16 g_5 d^5 x r + 12 l^2 , [ eh ] where @xmath2 is the five - dimensional newton constant , @xmath3 is the ricci scalar , the cosmological constant is @xmath4 , and we have neglected a surface term at infinity .",
    "anti - de sitter solutions derived from this action can be embedded in ten - dimensional iib supergravity such that the supergravity background is of the form @xmath5 .",
    "the line element of a `` schwarzschild '' black hole in anti - de sitter space @xcite in five spacetime dimensions can be written as ds^2 = - 1 - 2 m g_5 r^2 + r^2 l^2 dt^2 + 1 - 2 m g_5 r^2 + r^2 l^2 ^ -1 dr^2 + r^2 d ^2_3 , [ hpds2 ] where @xmath6 is the inverse radius of ads space .",
    "this solution has a horizon at @xmath7 where r_+^2 = 1 2 l^2 -1 + .",
    "[ r+ ] when @xmath8 , the black hole could become unstable to localization on the @xmath9 by an analog of the gregory - laflamme mechanism @xcite . as a rule , one may determine a necessary ( though not sufficient ) condition for instability from entropic considerations .",
    "a straightforward computation then shows that localization instability could occur for very small black holes with @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "here we shall work with black holes with @xmath10 for which we do not expect such an instability .    to study the black hole s thermodynamics , we euclideanize the metric .",
    "the substitution @xmath11 makes the metric positive definite and , by the usual removal of the conical singularity at @xmath12 , yields a periodicity in @xmath13 of _ bh = 2 r_+ 1 + 2r_+^2 l^2 , [ invtemp ] which is identified with the inverse temperature of the black hole .",
    "the entropy is given by s_bh = a 4 g_5 = ^2 r_+^3 2 g_5 , [ s ] where @xmath14 is the `` area '' ( that is , three - volume ) of the horizon .",
    "the mass above the anti - de sitter background is u_bh = 3 4 m = 3 8 g_5 r_+^2 1 + r_+^2 l^2 .",
    "[ ubh ] this is the ads equivalent of the adm mass , or energy at infinity .",
    "( actually if the black hole is to be considered at thermal equilibrium it should properly be regarded as being surrounded by a thermal envelope of hawking particles .",
    "because of the infinite blueshift at the horizon , the envelope contributes a formally infinite energy .",
    "here we shall neglect this infinite energy as unphysical , absorbed perhaps by a renormalization of the newton constant . )",
    "we can now also write down the free energy : f_bh = r_+^2 8 g_5 1 - r_+^2 l^2 .",
    "[ fbh ] eqs .",
    "( [ s]-[fbh ] ) then satisfy the first law of thermodynamics . to express them in terms of the gauge theory parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , we substitute physical data taken from the boundary of the black hole spacetime . at fixed @xmath18 , the boundary line element tends to ds^2 r_0 ^ 2 , giving a volume of v_cft = 2 ^2 r_0 ^ 3 .",
    "the field theory temperature is the physical temperature at the boundary : t_cft = t_bh . to obtain an expression for @xmath15 , we invoke the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "this relates @xmath15 to the radius of @xmath9 and the cosmological constant : r^2_s^5 = = 1 l^2 .",
    "then , since ( 2 ) ^7 g_s^2 ^4 = 16 g_10 = 16 ^4 l^5 g_5 , we have n^2 = 2 l^3 g_5 .",
    "[ n ] with these substitutions , we see that in the limit @xmath19 , the black hole entropy can be expressed in terms of conformal field theory parameters as s_bh = 2 3 ^2 n^2 v_cft t_cft ^3 .",
    "the dimensionful terms in this expression are in accord with expectations for a conformal theory .",
    "the matching has been extended @xcite to rotating black holes and their field theory dual , yang - mills with angular momentum .",
    "the dependence on @xmath20 indicates that the conformal field theory is in its unconfined phase ; the @xmath20 species of free gluons make independent contributions to the free energy .",
    "we shall see in the next section that the thermodynamics of the confined phase is rather different .",
    "now consider a gas of thermal radiation in anti - de sitter space .",
    "the energy eigenstates of @xmath21 are @xcite : _ j m n ( r , t , , , ) = n_j -i l t ^j c^j+1_-j-1 ( ) y^m n _ j ( , , ) , with the condition @xmath22 where @xmath23 are gegenbauer polynomials , @xmath24 are the spherical harmonics in five - dimensional spacetime ( with total angular momentum number @xmath25 ) , and @xmath26 . here",
    "@xmath27 is an integer and hence the spectrum is quantized in units of @xmath6 , the inverse `` radius '' of ads . since this is also the quantum of excitations of the five - sphere",
    ", we should consider thermodynamics over the full ten - dimensional space .",
    "the appropriate line element is therefore ds^2 = - 1 + r^2 l^2 dt^2 + 1 + r^2 l^2 ^-1 dr^2 + r^2 d",
    "_ 3 ^ 2 + l^2 d _ 5 ^ 2 .",
    "[ ads ] to obtain a thermal field theory , we again euclideanize the metric . the periodicity of @xmath28 is then the inverse ( asymptotic ) temperature , @xmath29 , of the theory ; the absence of a horizon means that @xmath30 is an arbitrary parameter .",
    "however , the relevant temperature for thermodynamics in the bulk is not @xmath30 , but the local , redshifted , temperature : t_local = t_ads = t_ads .",
    "[ redshift ] to calculate thermodynamic quantities we foliate spacetime into ( timelike ) slices of constant local temperature .",
    "extensive thermodynamic quantities are then computed by adding the contribution of each such hypersurface .",
    "the local five - dimensional energy density of the thermal gas of radiation can be written as _ local = t^10_local , [ rho ] where we have neglected infrared effects due to curvature or nonconformality . here",
    "@xmath31 is the ten - dimensional supersymmetric generalization of the stefan - boltzmann constant , which is approximated by its flat space value : = 62 105 ^5 , where we have included a factor of 128 , the number of massless bosonic physical degrees of freedom of iib supergravity .",
    "the total `` adm '' energy - at - infinity of a gas contained in a ball of radius @xmath32 is then u_gas^ = t^10_local r^3 dr d _ 3 = 2 ^5 l^5 t_ads^10 _ 0^r_0 r^3 dr v_eff ( r_0 ) t_ads^10 .",
    "[ ugas ] here the additional blueshift factor of @xmath33 converts the local ( fiducial ) energy into an adm - type energy , comparable to eq . ( [ ubh ] ) .",
    "we have also defined an effective volume , v_eff(r_0)= 2 ^5 l^9 - 2 + 3 ( r_0 l)^2 , which , as @xmath34 , approaches .",
    "thermodynamically , anti - de sitter space behaves as if it had a finite volume .",
    "similarly , the other thermodynamic quantities of the thermal bath are f = - 9 v_eff t_ads^10 s = 10 9 v_eff t_ads^9 , consistent with the first law of thermodynamics .",
    "the absence of a @xmath2 in the free energy indicates , from the cft point of view , that the free energy is of order @xmath35 .",
    "this is the confined phase of the theory  the free energy is of order @xmath35 because the @xmath20 species of gluons have condensed into hadronic color singlets .",
    "( curiously , attempts to formulate confinement in terms of anti - de sitter space date back at least to the 1970 s @xcite . )",
    "the factor of nine spatial dimensions in the volume is somewhat puzzling for a three - dimensional gauge theory .",
    "it reflects the fact that the qcd ( sym ) string is really a type iib string which naturally lives in nine spatial dimensions .",
    "it has been suggested that the extra dimensions in which the open string worldsheet bounded by a wilson loop can extend are akin to liouville dimensions @xcite .",
    "a field theory living on a manifold , @xmath36 with three - sphere radius @xmath32 , is dual to those five - dimensional einstein manifolds that have the same geometry at @xmath32 . in the microcanonical approach that we shall follow ,",
    "the contributions to the partition function come from both the black hole and the gas in thermally - identified ads where the energy of the gas and black hole are taken to be the same : z(u ) = e^-i_bh(u ) + e^-i_gas(u ) .",
    "[ part ] which of these two thermodynamic phases the system is found in is determined , in the saddle point approximation , by the relative values of the respective euclidean classical actions .",
    "the action of the black hole is simply the einstein - hilbert action , eq .",
    "( [ eh ] ) .",
    "this is proportional to the volume of the spacetime and so needs to be regulated .",
    "a finite action is obtained by subtracting the ( also infinite ) action for thermally - identified anti - de sitter space in which the hypersurface at a constant large radius has the same intrinsic geometry as a hypersurface at the same radius in the black hole background @xcite .",
    "the regularized black hole action is i_bh = ^2 r_+^3 4 g_5 1 - r_+^2 l^2 1 + 2 r_+^2 l^2 .",
    "[ ibh ] subtracting the anti - de sitter background is equivalent to choosing the ground state of the theory .",
    "then the comparable value of the action for the gas in thermally - identified ads should be just the action of the gas itself , namely @xmath37 .",
    "thus i_gas = -1 9 v_eff t_ads^9 .",
    "[ igas ]    the qualitative thermodynamic behavior of the system is determined by the action which dominates the partition function eq .",
    "( [ part ] ) . at the crossover between the two phases ,",
    "the action for the gas and the black hole are the same .",
    "moreover , energy must be conserved .",
    "hence one may determine the conditions for a smooth crossover from the following equations : u^local_gas = u^local_bh i_gas = i_bh .",
    "note that , since the two phases can not be in physical contact , the physical temperature does not have to be the same for the two phases .",
    "( the physical temperatures are the same at @xmath38 . )",
    "how accurate is this equation ? in using eq .",
    "( [ redshift ] ) , we have omitted the back - reaction of the gas on the metric .",
    "one may estimate this . consider a spherically symmetric stationary spacetime with a cosmological constant and massive matter fields .",
    "the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium ( equally , the @xmath40 einstein equation ) reads m(r ) = 8 ^2 r^3 g_5 + , where @xmath41 .",
    "back - reaction can reliably be neglected when the matter term in the parenthesis is ( much ) smaller than the cosmological term .",
    "for an energy density given by eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) and a total energy matched to that of the black hole phase , eq .",
    "( [ ubh ] ) , the condition @xmath42 amounts to x^2 ( 1 + x^2 ) l^2 < 6 l^2 , and we see that the matter term becomes dominant at large @xmath43 , and is not entirely negligible even near @xmath44 . at high temperature ,",
    "therefore , eq . ( [ cross ] ) becomes unreliable ; this limit has been studied elsewhere @xcite . to accommodate the effect of matter , one might try to seek a solution to the linearized einstein equations , perturbed around the @xmath21 background . the exact form of eq . ( [ cross ] ) would also be modified by including the correct stefan - boltzmann constant for anti - de sitter space . and finally , when @xmath15 is small , the supergravity approximation itself breaks down .      despite these caveats , eq .",
    "( [ cross ] ) seems to capture the correct qualitative behavior . in fig . 1 , we plot @xmath15 near the crossover for @xmath45 .",
    "the region below the crossover curve is dominated by the confined or ads gas phase , whereas the region above is dominated by the unconfined or black hole phase .",
    "note that @xmath43 grows roughly like the dimensionless product @xmath46 .",
    "as the temperature / volume increases , the graph confirms our expectation that the theory becomes conformal . as @xmath15 goes to infinity",
    ", we recover the result @xcite that the transition occurs at @xmath47 .",
