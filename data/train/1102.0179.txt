    "this paper is part of an investigation concerning the theoretical formulation of kinetic theory for collisionless astrophysical plasmas in accretion disks ( ads ) around compact objects , and its application to the study of their equilibrium properties and dynamical evolution .",
    "note that what is meant here by the word equilibrium  is in general a stationary - flow solution , which can also include a stationary radial accretion velocity .",
    "in contrast with the majority of previous treatments , which are based on fluid approaches within the context of hydrodynamics ( hd ) or magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) @xcite , here we adopt a kinetic approach . this provides a phase - space treatment allowing us to formulate a consistent description of plasma dynamics .",
    "kinetic theory is essential for studying both stationary configurations and dynamical evolution of plasmas when kinetic effects are relevant , such as ones associated with conservation of particle adiabatic invariants , temperature anisotropy , finite larmor - radius ( flr ) effects ( as pointed out in ref.@xcite ) and kinetic trapping phenomena .",
    "these properties are relevant for magnetized plasmas and in particular for those arising in ads @xcite whenever the plasma is regarded as collisionless or weakly collisional cremasch2008 - 2,cremasch2009 .    in the context of astrophysical ads , there are several examples of collisionless plasmas of this kind , with both strong and weak magnetic fields .",
    "one is the case of radiatively inefficient accretion flows ( riafs ) @xcite , in geometrically thick disks around black holes consisting of two - temperature plasma , with the ion temperature being much higher than the electron one , and the timescale of the coulomb collision frequency being much longer than the inflow time .",
    "other interesting applications occur in ads around neutron stars and white dwarfs : in the inner regions of such disks , where the magnetic field of the central object becomes dominant , ions and electrons can be collisionally decoupled and sustain different temperatures .",
    "this happens , in particular , if the radiative cooling time - scale of the electrons is much shorter than the time - scale for electron - ion collisions . in this way ,",
    "electrons and ions are thermally decoupled : the two charged species acquire unequal temperatures and the accretion flow becomes a two - temperature flow saxton2005,saxton2007",
    ".    in our earlier paper ( ref.@xcite , hereafter referred to as paper i ) , we presented preliminary results in this direction , concerning formulation of kinetic theory for investigating stationary solutions for collisionless ad plasmas , focusing on configurations with locally - closed magnetic flux surfaces .",
    "the present paper is intended as a continuation of the previous one , with the aim of generalizing the previous solution to arbitrary magnetic field configurations , which are no longer restricted to localized spatial domains in the disk .",
    "we refer to fig.1 below and the discussion in section ii for an explicit comparison of the two configurations .",
    "more specifically , in paper i the treatment concerned collisionless magnetized plasmas characterized by locally closed and nested magnetic surfaces . for such configurations",
    ", it was shown that suitable kinetic distribution functions ( kdfs ) are permitted , describing both kinetic and gyrokinetic ( gk ) equilibria ( see definition in paper i ) , which are represented by generalized maxwellian and bi - maxwellian kdfs .",
    "a main feature was the inclusion in the kinetic treatment of both temperature anisotropy and flr effects .",
    "in particular , in paper i and in ref.@xcite , it was proved that these equilibria can sustain a stationary kinetic dynamo . as a basic consequence , it was found that both toroidal and poloidal equilibrium magnetic fields can be self generated for quasi - neutral plasmas , _ without ongoing instabilities and/or turbulence phenomena_. in particular , in closed nested field configurations [ and hence in the local absence of net accretion flow ] , the toroidal field component was found to be produced by diamagnetic effects driven by the species temperature anisotropies . as a further development , in paper i and in ref.@xcite ,",
    "it was pointed out that the kinetic treatment allows one to construct exact fluid equilibria ( identically satisfying the corresponding fluid equations ) . using a perturbative expansion , a well - defined set of kinetic closure conditions",
    "was determined analytically for the relevant stationary moment equations .      despite more than forty years of observations and theoretical investigations",
    ", there is a lot remaining to be understood about the physical processes governing the structure and evolution of ads .",
    "they are observed in a wide range of astrophysical contexts @xcite and consist of plasma orbiting a central object with the velocities of the inward accretion flow usually being much smaller than the rotational velocities . in order for the accretion to happen , there needs to be a net outward transport of angular momentum and there are several conceivable mechanisms for producing this ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the most obvious one is fluid viscosity , but this would need to be an anomalousviscosity , driven by some type of turbulence , rather than a standard viscosity connected with coulomb collisions ( spitzer viscosity ) which would be much too small to explain the observed accretion rates under the conditions actually found in accretion disks ( see lomi09 for a review of turbulence mechanisms ) . however , other collisionless physical mechanisms are possible in principle , such as kinetic instabilities , radiation effects and magnetic reconnection .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to help in preparing the way for a discussion of these .",
    "we focus on ad plasmas immersed in slowly time - varying magnetic fields , characterized locally by open nested magnetic surfaces . for these systems ,",
    "no kinetic treatment has been available up to now .",
    "the origin of their magnetic fields varies depending on the type of the central object : in the case of black holes , the fields are only ones self - generated by currents in the plasma itself via dynamo effects , while with neutron stars and white dwarfs there can also be a magnetic field intrinsic to the central object @xcite .",
    "the interplay between magnetic fields and accretion plasmas can affect the overall velocity profile of the disk , as well as giving rise to species - dependent velocities and rotational frequencies naso , cremasch2008 - 1 , cremasch2008 - 2 .",
    "moreover , the magnetic field can be a source of anisotropies in the kdf and allow particular symmetries which influence both the single particle and collective plasma behavior .",
    "the transport of angular momentum , the accretion flow and the possible generation of jets @xcite are all strongly dependent on the magnetic field structure and so magnetic fields play an important role for ad physics .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to formulate a comprehensive kinetic treatment for collisionless axisymmetric ad plasmas including both accretion flows and collisionless dynamo effects .",
    "we include general relative orderings between the magnitudes of the external and self - generated magnetic fields and allow the magnetic field be non - uniform and slowly time - varying while possessing locally nested open magnetic surfaces .    extending the investigation developed in paper i",
    ", we do this by constructing particular quasi - stationary solutions of the vlasov - maxwell equations , characterized by generalized bi - maxwellian phase - space distributions ( see also paper i ) , which are referred to here as quasi - stationary asymptotic kdfs ( qsa - kdfs ) .",
    "as discussed below , the functional form of these solutions is physically motivated .",
    "we will show that this makes possible the explicit inclusion of both _ temperature anisotropies _ and _ parallel velocity perturbations _ in the qsa - kdfs ( see the definition below in section 4 ) .",
    "this is done , first , by developing an ad hoc  formulation for gk theory in the presence of a gravitational field , making it possible to directly construct the relevant particle guiding - center adiabatic invariants .",
    "the qsa - kdfs are then expressed in terms of these .",
    "remarkably , this allows also the consistent treatment of trapping phenomena due to spatial variations both of the magnetic field and of the total effective potential ( gravitational em trapping ) .",
    "second , the qsa - kdfs are constructed by imposing appropriate _ kinetic constraints _ ( see section 4 ) , requiring that suitable _ structure functions _ ( see below ) which enter the definition of the qsa - kdfs , depend only on the azimuthal canonical momentum and total particle energy . by invoking suitable perturbative expansions",
    ", it follows that the relevant moments and moment equations can be evaluated analytically .",
    "the solution thus obtained can be used for investigating the quasi - stationary dynamics of magnetized ad plasmas , including description of quasi - stationary accretion flows and  allowing for the generation of finite poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields .",
    "in particular , the kinetic theory predicts the possibility of pure matter inflows as well as the independent coexistence of both inflows and outflows .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we summarize the basic assumptions and definitions of the theory . in section 3",
    "we formulate the gk theory for magnetized accretion disk plasmas , deriving the relevant integrals of motion and guiding - center adiabatic invariants and discussing the particle trapping phenomenon .",
    "section 4 deals with the construction of a generalized asymptotic stationary kdf , with the inclusion of parallel velocity perturbations and the adoption of suitable kinetic constraints . in section 5",
    "we give an analytic expansion for the kdf and discuss its main features .",
    "section 6 deals with the relationship between kinetic theory and the corresponding fluid treatment , which concerns the validity of moment equations and the analytic calculation of fluid fields .",
    "section 7 is dedicated to discussing the temporal evolution of the gk equilibria and derivation of the dynamical equation for the gk kdf . in section 8",
    "we investigate the implication of the kinetic solution for the ampere equation and the existence of the kinetic dynamo effect .",
    "then , in section 9 we discuss the treatment of quasi - stationary accretion flow within the present formulation , showing that solutions with net radial accretion are admitted consistently with the constraints imposed by the maxwell equations .",
    "finally , section 10 contains a summary of the main results with closing remarks .",
    "ignoring possible weakly - dissipative effects ( coulomb collisions and turbulence ) , we shall assume that the kdf and the em fields associated with the plasma obey the system of vlasov - maxwell equations , with maxwell s equations being considered in the quasi - static approximation . for definiteness , we shall consider here a plasma consisting of at least two species of charged particles : one species of ions ( @xmath0 ) and one of electrons ( @xmath1 ) .    following the treatment presented in paper i",
    ", we shall take the ad plasma to be : a ) _ non - relativistic _ , in the sense that it has non ",
    "relativistic species flow velocities , that the gravitational field can be treated within the classical newtonian theory , and that the non - relativistic vlasov kinetic equation is used as the dynamical equation for the kdf ;  b ) _ collisionless _ , so that the mean free path of the plasma particles is much longer than the largest characteristic scale length of the plasma ; c )  _ axisymmetric _ , so that the relevant dynamical variables characterizing the plasma ( e.g. , the fluid fields ) are independent of the azimuthal angle @xmath2 when referred to a set of cylindrical coordinates @xmath3 ; d ) acted on by both gravitational and em fields .",
    "the kinetic formulation is intrinsically asymptotic .",
    "this means that the theory ( in particular the gk theory formulated in the next section ) is characterized by a suitable species - dependent dimensionless physical parameter @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes the species index . here",
    "@xmath6 is the species average larmor radius , with @xmath7 denoting the species thermal velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field and @xmath8 being the species larmor frequency .",
    "moreover , @xmath9 is the characteristic length - scale of the spatial inhomogeneities of the em field , defined as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the characteristic magnitudes of the gradients of the absolute values of the magnetic field @xmath13 and the electric field @xmath14 , defined as @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where the vector @xmath17 denotes @xmath18 .",
    "then , in analogy with paper i , we define a unique parameter @xmath19 . for temperatures and magnetic fields typical of ad plasmas",
    ", we have @xmath20 .    in the following",
    "we will focus on solutions for the equilibrium magnetic field @xmath21 which admit , at least locally , a family of nested and _ open _ axisymmetric toroidal magnetic surfaces @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes the poloidal magnetic flux of @xmath21 .",
    "see fig . 1 for a schematic comparison between the configuration of locally closed magnetic surfaces considered in paper i and the case of open magnetic surfaces analyzed in the present study .",
    "a set of magnetic coordinates ( @xmath24 ) can be defined locally , where @xmath25 is a curvilinear angle - like coordinate on the magnetic surfaces @xmath26 each relevant physical quantity @xmath27 can then be conveniently expressed either in terms of the cylindrical coordinates or as a function of the magnetic coordinates , i.e. @xmath28 where the @xmath29 dependence has been suppressed due to the axisymmetry .",
    "we require the em field to be slowly varying in time , i.e. , to be of the form @xmath30 ,   \\label{b0}\\]]with @xmath31 being a suitable integer .",
    "this time dependence is connected with either external sources or boundary conditions for the kdf . in particular",
    ", we shall assume that the magnetic field is of the form @xmath32where @xmath33 and @xmath34 denote the self - generated magnetic field produced by the ad plasma and a finite external magnetic field produced by the central object ( in the case of neutron stars or white dwarfs ) . for greater generality , we shall not prescribe any relative orderings between the various components of the total magnetic field , which are taken to be of the form@xmath35 in particular , here @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the toroidal and poloidal components of the self - field , while the external magnetic field @xmath34 has to be purely poloidal , as a consequence of the axisymmetry , and is defined in terms of the vacuum potential @xmath38 . as a consequence , the magnetic field",
    "can also be written in the equivalent form @xmath39where the function @xmath40 is defined as @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 defining a set of local magnetic coordinates ( as implied by the equation @xmath44 which is identically satisfied ) .",
    "also , it is assumed that the charged particles of the plasma are subject to the action of _ effective _ _ em potentials _",
    "@xmath45 where @xmath46 is the vector potential corresponding to the magnetic field of eq.([b field ] ) , while @xmath47 is given by@xmath48with @xmath49 @xmath50 and @xmath51 denoting the _ effective _ electrostatic potential and the electrostatic and generalized gravitational potentials ( the latter , in principle , being produced both by the central object and the accretion disk ) .",
    "the effective electric field @xmath52 can then be defined as@xmath53",
    "in this section we recall the gk theory appropriate for the description of ad plasmas .",
    "its formulation is in fact a prerequisite for the construction of the kinetic quasi - stationary equilibria to be developed later .",
    "the appropriate generalization of gk theory allowing for the presence of strong gravitational fields should in principle be based on a covariant formulation [ see @xcite ] .",
    "however , for non - relativistic plasmas within a gravitational field , the appropriate formulation can also be directly recovered via a suitable reformulation of the standard non - relativistic theory holding for magnetically confined plasmas catto1978,littlejohn1979,littlejohn1981,littlejohn1983,dubin1983,hahm1988,bernstein1985,balescu , meiss1990 .    in this case , the appropriate particle lagrangian function can be represented in terms of the effective em potentials @xmath54 with @xmath31 , where @xmath55 is defined in eq.([efp ] ) . in terms of the hybrid variables",

    "it follows that if the argument becomes null for given @xmath124 and @xmath125 , the parallel velocity must change sign so that the particle undergoes a spatial reflection .",
    "the points of the configuration space where this occurs are the so - called _",
    "mirror points_. the existence of these points may generate various kinetic phenomena in ad plasmas . in particular , for open magnetic surfaces , particles can in principle experience zero , one or two reflections corresponding respectively to _ passing particles ( pps ) , bouncing particles ( bps ) _ and _ trapped particles ( tps)_. in the present case , since the right hand side of eq.([trap ] ) depends on the magnitude of the magnetic field ( @xmath126 ) , the effective potential energy ( @xmath127 ) and the centrifugal potential ( @xmath128 ) , we shall refer to the tps case as _ gravitational em trapping_. in section vii we shall investigate some consequences of trapping phenomena for the dynamics of ads .",
    "in this section we show that the equilibrium generalized bi - maxwellian solution for the kdf obtained in paper i can be extended to qsa - kdfs describing axisymmetric ad plasmas with the following features :    \\1 ) the kdf is also axisymmetric ;    \\2 ) each species in the collisionless plasma is considered to be associated with a suitable set of _ sub - species _ ( referring to the different populations mentioned above ) , each one having a different kdf ;    \\3 ) temperature anisotropy : for all of the species , it is assumed that different parallel and perpendicular temperatures are allowed ( with respect to the local direction of the magnetic field ) ;    \\4 ) accretion flow velocity : a non - vanishing species dependent poloidal flow velocity is prescribed ;    \\5 ) open , locally nested magnetic flux surfaces : the magnetic field is taken to allow quasi - stationary solutions with magnetic flux lines belonging to open and locally nested magnetic surfaces ;    \\6 ) kinetic constraints : suitable functional dependencies are imposed so that the kdf is an adiabatic invariant ;    \\7 ) analytic form : the solution is required to be asymptotically close  to a local bi - maxwellian in order to permit comparisons with previous literature dealing with maxwellian or a bi - maxwellian kdfs ( see for example @xcite ) .",

    "requirements 1 ) - 7 ) clearly imply that the solution can not generally be a maxwellian . however , in analogy with paper i , it is possible to show that they can be fulfilled by a suitable modified bi - maxwellian expressed solely in terms of first integrals of motion and adiabatic invariants cremasch2008 - 2,cremasch2009,kocha10 .",
    "it follows that this is necessarily a qsa - kdf .",
    "a set of fluid equations can then readily be determined using this solution , expressed in terms of four moments of the kdf [ corresponding to the species number density , flow velocity and the parallel and perpendicular temperatures ] .",

    ", it is possible to show that a particular solution for the qsa - kdf is given by:@xmath132which we refer to as the _ generalized bi - maxwellian kdf _ _ with parallel velocity perturbations_. here @xmath133",

    "as we shall show at the end of this section , this feature can be used to require that the qsa - kdf carries a non - vanishing parallel flow velocity .",

    "we reach the equivalent representation for the qsa - kdf:@xmath148 in order for the solution ( [ sol2 ] ) [ or equivalently ( [ sol1 ] ) ] to be a function of the integrals of motion and of the adiabatic invariants , the functions @xmath149 , which we will refer to as _ structure functions _ , must be adiabatic invariants by themselves .",
    "to further generalize the solution of paper i , we shall here retain a functional dependence on both the total particle energy and the canonical momentum , thus imposing the functional dependencies@xmath150which will be referred to in the following as _ kinetic constraints_. the kinetic constraints ( [ kincon ] ) provide the most general solution for @xmath133 .",
    "it can be shown that the physical motivation behind imposing these dependencies lies essentially in the fact that the asymptotic condition of small inverse aspect ratio ( adopted previously in paper i ) is no longer valid . in the present context , the kinetic solution is no longer restricted to localized spatial domains in the disk but applies to the general configuration of open magnetic surfaces .",

    "some basic properties of @xmath133 are :    property 1 : @xmath133 is itself an adiabatic invariant , and is therefore an asymptotic solution of the stationary vlasov equation , i.e. , a qsa - kdf ;    property 2 : @xmath133 is only defined in the subset of phase - space where the adiabatic invariants @xmath107 , @xmath153 and @xmath98 are defined .",

    "unlike the customary view based on ideal mhd , for which a self - consistent treatment of inflow and outflow solutions is usually difficult , within the present theory both inflows and outflows can occur independently and are described consistently by their respective qsa - kdfs . in particular , eq.([angcons ] ) shows that radial flows arise due both to the parallel velocities @xmath368 and to the kinetic effects carried by the flr diamagnetic corrections . as a result ,",
    "species radial flow velocities appear necessarily in combination with non - isotropic tensor pressures and a non - vanishing toroidal magnetic field . in conclusion ,",
    "the theory predicts the possibility of having purely inflowing matter in quasi - stationary ad plasmas , or of having co - existing inflows and outflows .",
    "in this paper , a consistent theoretical investigation of the slow kinetic dynamics of collisionless non - relativistic and axisymmetric ad plasmas has been presented .",
    "the formulation is based on a kinetic approach developed within the framework of the vlasov - maxwell description .",
    "we have considered here plasmas immersed in quasi - stationary magnetic fields characterized by open nested magnetic surfaces .",
    "this can be appropriate for radiatively inefficient accretion flows onto black holes , some of which are believed to be associated with a plasma of collisionless ions and electrons having different temperatures , and there can be other related applications to the inner regions of accretion flows onto magnetized neutron stars and white dwarfs .",
    "the discussion presented here provides a background for future investigations of instabilities and turbulence occurring in these plasmas .",
    "we have shown that a new type of asymptotic kinetic equilibria exists , which can be described by qsa - kdfs expressed in terms of generalized bi - maxwellian distributions .",
    "these solutions permit the consistent treatment of a number of physical properties characteristic of collisionless plasmas .",
    "the existence of these equilibrium solutions has been shown to be warranted by imposing suitable kinetic constraints for the structure functions entering the definition of the qsa - kdfs . in terms of these solutions ,",
    "the slow dynamics of collisionless ad plasmas has been described by means of a suitable reduced gk - vlasov equation .",
    "in addition , the theory permits the consistent treatment of gravitational em particle trapping phenomena , allowing one to distinguish between different populations of charged particles .",
    "we have shown that the kinetic approach is suitable for the description of quasi - stationary ad plasmas subject to accretion flows and kinetic dynamo effects responsible for the self - generation of both poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields .",
    "four intrinsically - kinetic physical mechanisms have been included in the treatment of this , related to temperature anisotropy , parallel velocity perturbations and flr - diamagnetic effects .",
    "the novelty of the present approach , with respect to traditional fluid treatments , lies in the possibility of explicitly constructing asymptotic solutions for the fluid equations : the calculation of all of the relevant fluid fields involved ( e.g. the plasma charge and mass current densities and the radial flow velocity ) can be performed in a straightforward way using a species - dependent asymptotic expansion of the qsa - kdf .",
    "we believe that this study makes a relevant contribution for the description of two - temperature collisionless ad plasmas and the improvement of our understanding of their physical properties . the kinetic treatment developed here",
    "can also provide a convenient starting point for making a kinetic stability analysis of these plasmas .",
