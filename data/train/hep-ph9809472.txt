    "the flavor - universal coloron model @xcite was originally proposed to explain the apparent excess of high-@xmath2 jets in the inclusive jet spectrum measured at the fermilab tevatron by the cdf collaboration @xcite .",
    "this model is a flavor - universal variant of the coloron model of hill and parke @xcite which involves a minimal extension of the standard description of the strong interactions , including the addition of one gauge interaction and a scalar multiplet , but no new fermions .",
    "the flavor - universal coloron model of the strong interactions can be grafted onto the standard one - higgs - doublet model of electroweak physics , yielding a simple , complete , and renormalizable theory .",
    "alternatively , it can provide the basis for dynamical generation of electroweak symmetry breaking and the generation of the top quark s mass in models @xcite akin to top - color - assisted technicolor @xcite .",
    "previous work on the phenomenology of the colorons has considered effects on the @xmath3 parameter @xcite , the inclusive jet spectrum @xcite , the dijet spectrum and angular distributions @xcite , and b - tagged dijets @xcite .",
    "the most recent of these analyses @xcite put a limit @xmath4 gev on the the coefficient of the four - fermion contact interaction to which heavy coloron exchange would give rise .",
    "this letter explores the effects colorons would have on the dijet mass spectrum measured at the tevatron by the d  collaboration @xcite and establishes a still stronger limit on contact interactions arising from colorons : @xmath0 gev at 95% cl . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly review the model .",
    "section 3 explains how our limit was derived .",
    "section 4 discusses our conclusions and the implications for models of quark compositeness , non - standard gluon interactions , and dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "we also present a separate limit on the scale of color - octet axial - vector contact interactions among quarks .",
    "in the flavor - universal coloron model @xcite , the strong gauge group is extended to @xmath5 .",
    "the gauge couplings are , respectively , @xmath6 and @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "each quark transforms as a ( 1,3 ) under this extended strong gauge group .",
    "the model also includes a scalar boson @xmath9 transforming as a @xmath10 under the two @xmath11 groups . for a range of couplings in the scalar potential",
    ", @xmath9 develops a vacuum expectation value @xmath12 which breaks the two strong groups to their diagonal subgroup @xcite .",
    "we identify this unbroken subgroup with qcd .    when the extended color symmetry breaks , the original gauge bosons mix to form an octet of massless gluons and an octet of massive colorons .",
    "the gluons interact with quarks through a conventional qcd coupling with strength @xmath13 .",
    "the colorons @xmath14 interact with quarks through a new qcd - like coupling @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the color current @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the mass of the colorons may be written @xmath19 in terms of the parameters of the model .",
    "below the scale @xmath20 , coloron - exchange may be approximated by the effective four - fermion interaction @xmath21 this can be re - written in the form commonly used in studies of quark compositeness @xcite @xmath22 where the scale @xmath23 is defined by @xmath24 .",
    "contact interactions of this kind tend to increase quark - quark scattering at high invariant mass above the standard qcd prediction .",
    "the d  collaboration recently @xcite measured the inclusive dijet mass spectrum at @xmath25= 1.8 tev for dijet masses above 200 gev and jet pseudorapidity @xmath26 . the collaboration also measured the ratio of spectra at @xmath27 and @xmath28 and used this to place a limit on certain models of quark compositeness .",
    "we use this same ratio of spectra to place limits on the effects of flavor - universal colorons .",
    "we calculated the leading - order ( lo ) dijet spectrum @xmath29    { d\\sigma\\over d\\hat{t}}(ab \\to cd ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in terms of the jets pseudorapidities ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ; @xmath32 ) , combined invariant mass ( @xmath33 ) and momentum fractions ( @xmath34 ) ; the parton distribution functions ( @xmath35 ) ; and the two - body parton scattering cross section @xmath36 the leading qcd contributions to @xmath37 may be found in @xcite and the contributions from heavy coloron exchange are given . ] in @xcite .",
    "note that we included only production of gluons and light quarks in our calculations since produced top quarks would not contribute appreciably to the d  dijet sample jet . ]",
    "taking a series of different values for the coloron interaction strength @xmath38 , we then determined the ratio @xmath39 at values of @xmath33 corresponding to the weighted center of each mass bin for 800 gev @xmath40 1400 gev ; this yielded the same ratio as keeping @xmath33 fixed at the weighted center value of 873.2 gev . ]",
    "measured by d  in ref.@xcite .",
    "we evaluated the fractional difference between the dijet spectra for pure qcd and for the various values of @xmath38 . to simulate a next - to - leading order ( nlo ) prediction of the effects of colorons",
    ", we multiplied a nlo qcd prediction obtained using the jetrad program @xcite by the lo fractional differences .",
    "the results are illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "we extract a limit on the coloron interaction strength from the ddata @xcite using bayesian techniques with a gaussian likelihood function @xmath41^t\\ , s^{-1}\\ , [ d - f(x ) ] \\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the vector of data points for the different mass bins , @xmath43 is the vector of theory points for the different masses at different values of @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the covariance matrix . motivated by the form of @xmath46 ( eqn .",
    "( [ lamta ] ) ) , the prior probability is assumed to be flat when @xmath47 .",
    "since the ratio of spectra at nlo is sensitive to the choice of @xmath48 and parton distribution function , each possible choice is treated as a different theory . the 95% confidence limit ( cl ) on @xmath49",
    "is calculated by requiring that @xmath50 the limit in @xmath51 is then transformed back into a limit on @xmath49 and thence into a limit on @xmath38 .",
    "the most conservative lower bound we obtain at the 95% cl is @xmath0 gev for the cteq3 m pdf and @xmath52 ( where  is the maximum jet @xmath2 in the event ) as illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "this limit is incompatible with the suggestion of a coloron interaction strength of order 700 gev @xcite in earlier measurements of the high @xmath2 jet inclusive cross - section @xcite .",
    "our limit places a new exclusion bound in the @xmath53 vs. @xmath54 parameter space of the flavor - universal coloron model . as shown in figure 3 , this improves on the recent d  limit based on the dijet angular distribution @xcite .",
    "note that the region at @xmath55 where our limit appears to provide a direct lower bound on @xmath53 has already been excluded by cdf s search for new particles decaying to dijets @xcite .",
    "this is fortunate , because our limit actually becomes less reliable here : the condition @xmath56 , under which ( [ conta ] ) is a reasonable approximation to coloron exchange , would no longer hold for the highest - energy data point .",
    "an updated search for new resonances decaying to dijets would be a useful complement to the bounds we report here .    in the context of the dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking model of @xcite in which flavor - universal colorons help",
    "produce the mass of the top quark , the value of @xmath54 is approximately 4 . in other words ,",
    "the interaction strength is near its upper limit for the higgs phase of the model @xcite .",
    "our bound implies that @xmath57 tev in such models , placing them at the upper right of the allowed region in figure 3 .",
    "our findings also set a limit on a broader array of new strong interaction physics .",
    "writing eqn.([conta ] ) in the more conventional form for compositeness studies ( [ lamta ] ) shows that our limit is equivalent to a lower bound @xmath58 tev on the scale of new color - octet vectorial current - current interactions .",
    "such interactions could arise from quark compositeness or from non - standard gluon interactions ( e.g. gluon compositeness ) @xcite .",
    "finally , we have used the same methods to set a limit on a color - octet axial - vector current - current interaction among quarks .",
    "this has the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "the contributions of this contact interaction to parton scattering are given .",

    "the most conservative bound we find is @xmath61 tev at 95@xmath62 cl . note that we can not self - consistently interpret this as providing a lower bound on the mass of an axigluon @xcite whose exchange underlies the contact interaction ( [ axta ] ) .",
    "the relation @xmath63 ( since @xmath64 for axigluons ) shows that the mass of the supposed axigluon would not satisfy the condition @xmath65 . instead",
