    "single crystals of ( tmtsf)@xmath41pf@xmath42 with dimensions of approximately 2.0 @xmath43 0.1 @xmath43 0.1 mm@xmath44 were grown by a conventional electrochemical technique from commercially available products in 1,2-dichloroethane electrolyte solutions .",
    "the seebeck coefficient was measured using a steady - state two - thermometers , one - heater technique .",
    "a thermal gradient was applied along the sample by heating a chip resistor with the joule effect .",
    "the thermal gradient @xmath45 was determined by measuring the local temperature with two thermoemeters ( cernox resistors in the @xmath46he cryostat and ruo@xmath41 resistors in the @xmath44he-@xmath46he dilution refrigerator ) .",
    "the thermoelectric voltage @xmath47 was measured by a digital nanovoltmeter .",
    "the experimental uncertainties arising from the measurements of the thermoelectric voltage and the thermometer resistances are about 10 @xmath48 in the seebeck coefficient at the lowest temperature and less than 1 @xmath48 at 1 k.    two samples were measured in a @xmath44he-@xmath46he dilution refrigerator from 4 k down to 0.1 - 0.2 k ( in tokyo ) . another sample was measured in a @xmath46he cryostat from 30 k down to 2 k ( in paris ) .",

    ", the sample was slowly cooled with rates of @xmath26 0.1 - 0.3 k / min .",
    "the heat current @xmath49 was applied along the @xmath50-axis , the highest conductivity direction of the system .",
    "a stability of better than 0.001 @xmath48 of both sample temperature readouts was achieved in the entire measurement range . for each stabilized bath temperature ,",
    "a temperature difference of the order of 1 to 5 @xmath48 of the average temperature was applied , with @xmath51 being the mean temperature .    to achieve good thermal contacts , the thermometers ,",
    "the heater and the cold finger were connected by gold wires and silver paint to gold electrodes evaporated on the surface of the sample .",
    "the contact resistances were a few ohms .",
    "the same contacts and gold wires were used for the electrical connection for the measurement of thermoelectric voltage .",
    "the gold wires were switched to the superconducting wires on the thermometry for thermal isolation of the sample .",
    "the thermometer and heater chips were suspended by polyimide tubes and electrical connections were made with manganin wires .",
    "the heat loss along the wires and suspensions for the thermometry is estimated to be a factor of 1000 smaller than the heat flow through the sample .    in general ,",
    "the measured thermoelectric voltage is the difference of the thermoelectric power of two materials in contact , namely gold and ( tmtsf)@xmath41pf@xmath42 . in this case , the fact that the seebeck coefficient is two to six orders of magnitude smaller in gold than in ( tmtsf)@xmath41pf@xmath42 allows us to neglect the contribution of gold and the measured @xmath22 is approximated to be the absolute seebeck coefficient of ( tmtsf)@xmath41pf@xmath42 .    the same setup was used to measure the seebeck coefficient of the heavy - fermion compound ybrh@xmath41si@xmath41 using a comparable size of crystal in the same temperature range [ s1 ] .",
    "the results are reasonably consistent with those obtained by the different group utilizing the different setup [ s2 ] .",
    "the same contacts and wires were used for the electrical resistivity measurements by a four - point technique ( see fig .",

    "s1 , at low temperatures , in spite of the large resistance of the sample , the signal to noise ratio is large enough to allow a clear resolution of the voltage produced by the thermal gradient .",
    "we also checked that we remain in the linear response regime , by applying different temperature gradients and finding that the voltage - to - temperature - gradient ratio at a given temperature is insensitive to the magnitude of the thermal gradient .",

    "@xmath32 becomes as large as 10 m@xmath29 at the lowest temperature , but both impedances are much smaller than the impedance of nanovoltmeter ( 10 g@xmath29 ) . as shown in fig .",
    "s2b , while the resistance is different in the two samples , their resistivity is similar and in fair agreement with a previous report[s3 ] .",
    "the seebeck coefficient , @xmath22 , measured for both samples are shown in fig . s2c .",
    "as seen in the figure , there is a reasonable agreement between the two sets of the data .",
    "we conclude that the low - temperature upturn of the seebeck coefficient in the vrh regime leading to a finite value in the zero - temperature limit is reproduced in two samples .",
    "however , our data does not allow us to conclude if the magnitude of this residual term is sample - dependent or not .",
    "s3 compares our thermopower data across the sdw transition ( t@xmath54 12 k ) with three earlier reports[s4,s5,s6 ] .",
    "as seen in the figure , qualitatively , the four set of results resolve a similar anomaly at t@xmath55 .",
    "but , the positive jump in thermopower has different amplitudes in the four set of data .",
    "the jump we resolved is much larger than those seen by the three other groups .",
    "the most plausible source for this discrepancy is the magnitude of the applied thermal gradient . in our case",
    "we applied a temperature difference as low as 0.2k which is only 1.5 percent of the absolute temperature .",
    "usually , one applies temperature gradients larger than this , which would be fine when the seebeck coefficient does not go through a drastic change with temperature . in this case , however , since the seebeck coefficient is changing sign , the application of a thermal different as small as 0.5 k ( that is only 5 percent of the absolute temperature ) would drastically squeeze the magnitude of the sign change in seebeck coefficient . since the magnitude of the thermal gradient is not indicated in earlier works , we can not be sure that this is the origin of the discrepancy .",
    "let us note that there is correlation between the magnitudes of seebeck and specific heat anomalies . according to our data , the jump is @xmath56 30 @xmath7vk@xmath57 for thermopower and @xmath58 1.3 jk@xmath57mol@xmath57for specific heat[s7 ] .",
    "multiplying @xmath59 by @xmath60 ( @xmath4 is the electron charge and @xmath61 is the avogadro number ) , one find half of @xmath62 .",
    "this in additional support for the accuracy of our data near t@xmath55 .",

    "is our finding generic to all semiconductors ?",
    "the answer to this question is not known .",
    "the low - temperature thermoelectric response of semiconductors below the critical doping for metal - insulator transition has not been measured down to very low temperatures .",
    "this is true even in the case of the archetypical semiconductors , such as silicon and germanium . to the best of our knowledge , there are only a few studies devoted to them . in doped germanium with low arsenic concentrations ,",
    "the seebeck coefficient was reported to increase up to @xmath26 5 mv / k with decreasing temperature down to 5 k in the regime where the resistivity shows a ( vrh - like ) behavior [ s8 ] .",

    "<S> can the seebeck coefficient of a solid remain finite in the zero - temperature limit , the third law of thermodynamics notwithstanding ? to the best of our knowledge , this fundamental question is answered for the first time by the observation reported here .    </S>",

    "<S> is this result generic to all semiconductors cooled below their coulomb gap in the vrh regime ? </S>",

    "<S> therefore , the thermoelectric response of band insulators in the vrh limit remains an open question@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> as mott noted long ago@xcite , this formula assumes a single hopping probability for all sites and therefore , it can not be readily used in the vrh regime . </S>",
    "<S> the connection between the energy landscape carved by defects in a real insulator and the low - temperature thermoelectric response is an unexplored field of research . </S>",
    "<S> the configurational entropy of each hopping electron is the information which travels with it . therefore , there are potential links to the emerging field of thermodynamics of information@xcite .    in summary , we measured the seebeck coefficient ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 down to very low temperatures and found that the entry to the vrh regime is concomitant with a very large enhancement of the seebeck coefficient , which attains a magnitude as large as 37 mv / k implying that a finite seebeck coefficient can persist in a solid in the zero - temperature limit .    this work was supported in japan by jsps kakenhi grant number 25400361 , 23340099 and 15k05884 ( j - physics ) , in france by anr through the superfield project and in korea by the nrf grants funded by the korea government ( msip ) ( no . </S>",
