    "cosmic strings are one - dimensional topological defects of cosmological size , expected to form either during symmetry breaking phase transitions in the early universe ( field theory strings ) @xcite or at the end of inflation in brane - world scenarios ( cosmic superstrings ) @xcite",
    ".    the energy scale of cosmic strings is defined by their linear energy density or tension , @xmath4 , usually referenced through the dimensionless quantity @xmath0 , where @xmath5 is newton s constant and @xmath6 the speed of light . in the case of field theory strings , the tension is directly related to the energy scale @xmath7 of the phase transition that created them , @xmath8 in natural units , @xmath9 . in the case of cosmic superstrings ,",
    "their tension is directly related to the fundamental string coupling @xmath10 and the compactification or warping scales .",
    "therefore , the detection , or at least the constraining of the cosmic string tension , provides a unique laboratory for physics at high energies .",
    "a cosmic string network consists of infinite strings which stretch beyond our horizon and string loops @xcite . after its creation",
    ", the network evolves along with the expansion of the universe and is expected to settle into a scaling regime where all its fundamental properties scale along with the horizon radius @xmath11 , which is called the one - scale model .",
    "the scaling evolution of the network is attained through the creation of loops .",
    "when two cosmic strings intersect , they intercommute with a probability @xmath12 and exchange partners , chopping off loops from the network @xcite . in the one - scale model , loops are born with a size @xmath13 equal to a fraction of the particle horizon @xmath14 at the time of their birth , @xmath15 , where @xmath3 is a constant .",
    "these loops subsequently decay by emitting all of their energy in various forms of radiation , with the most dominant of them expected to be gravitational waves ( gws ) ( @xcite ; see , @xcite for an alternative ) .",
    "the gw emission from all the loops created by the network creates a stochastic gravitational wave background ( sgwb ) .",
    "recently , @xcite have studied in detail the properties of the cosmic string sgwb and set a conservative upper limit on the cosmic string tension , @xmath16 for networks with @xmath17 , avoiding any assumption on the parameters describing the gw emission mechanism .",
    "our result is approximately one order of magnitude weaker than the equivalent limit found by the @xcite analytic relation , @xmath18 @xcite , which is due to the strong assumptions made for the latter ( see also discussion in @xcite ) .    as part of the common effort of the european pulsar timing array ( epta , @xcite ) collaboration to detect gws with pulsar timing , we present here an expansion of our previous work to evaluate the tension constraints that will be achieved by future pulsar timing array ( pta ) experiments of different durations and ground - based / space - borne interferometers .",
    "this not only allows us to predict future constraints , but the semi - analytic formulae we deduce can be used when the limits on @xmath2 become available .",
    "first , we establish the parameter space accessible by each of these detectors .",
    "then , we discuss how the exclusion curves on the parameter space evolve relative to @xmath19 . using this information",
    ", we will evaluate the tension constraints as a function of @xmath2 for a range of experiments .",
    "we will also derive semi - analytic formulae for ease of use in future investigations .",
    "additionally , we discuss how the radiative efficiency parameter @xmath20 , affects these constraints .",
    "in the one - scale model , the basic parameters that determine the gw spectrum are : the cosmic string tension , @xmath0 ; the birth scale of loops relative to the horizon , @xmath3 ; and the intercommutation probability , @xmath12 . in order to compute the sgwb",
    ", we also need to model the spectrum of radiation emitted by a cosmic string loop .",
    "this is quantified by : its spectral index @xmath21 , with @xmath22 for cusps and @xmath23 for kinks @xcite ; a cut - off on the number of emission modes , @xmath24 , which is used to model the effects of gravitational backreaction @xcite ; and the radiative efficiency @xmath25 , which describes the efficiency of the gw emission mechanism @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we have described in detail the computation of the cosmic string sgwb which we will only briefly recap it here .    from the energy - momentum tensor for cosmic strings",
    "we find the energy lost into loops in order for the network to maintain scaling , @xmath26\\ , , \\label{eq::dedt}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the energy density of infinite strings , @xmath28 is the number of infinite strings within the horizon , @xmath29 is the mean squared velocity of cosmic strings , @xmath30 the scale factor and @xmath31 is the computation volume . we have considered @xmath28 and @xmath29 as fixed parameters , using their most recently published values @xcite , quoted in table  [ tab::params ] . assuming that loops have a length @xmath15 when they are born , from eq",
    ".   we can find the loop formation rate , @xmath32\\ , , \\label{dndt2}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the total number of loops within @xmath34 created since the creation of the network at @xmath35 , with @xmath36 the planck time .",
    "since the rate of decay of length for loops is @xmath37 , we are able to compute the number density @xmath38 of loops with length between @xmath39 and @xmath40 present at time @xmath41 .    in our gw emission model",
    ", each loop emits into a series of harmonics @xmath42 , with frequency @xmath43 and power @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "then , using eq .   and carefully redshifting the frequencies to the present time we can construct @xmath46 that provides the number density of loops , which at the @xmath47th mode and at time @xmath41 , emit gws detected at frequency @xmath48 .",
    "the computation of the energy density of gws per logarithmic frequency interval @xmath2 , where @xmath49 is the hubble parameter at the present time @xmath50 , is then given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the critical energy density .",
    "a correction has to be applied in eq . due to the annihilation of massive particles during the radiation era .",
    "when the temperature of the universe , @xmath53 , drops below a specific particle mass threshold , the relevant family becomes non - relativistic , changing the number of relativistic degrees of freedom , @xmath54 .",
    "this will result in a faster expansion of the universe every time such a mass threshold is crossed , affecting the value of @xmath30 @xcite . although these changes will not significantly affect the evolution of the cosmic string network , which will quickly adapt to the new expansion rate and converge to its scaling evolution , they will have a significant effect on the energy density of the gws emitted by the network .",
    "these effects can be included with the use of a multiplicative factor for @xmath55 , and therefore @xmath2 , which has the form @xmath56 , where @xmath57 and @xmath54 are the relativistic degrees of freedom before and after the transition , and acts to decrease the amplitude of the sgwb @xcite .",
    "this correction is applied at time @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and its effects are observed at a frequency @xmath60^{-1}$ ] , which depends strongly on @xmath3 .",
    "ptas , probing nhz gws , are not significantly affected by these corrections , and that only in the case where @xmath3 is large .",
    "these corrections were not considered in @xcite , but this does not affect the robustness of the results presented in the aforementioned paper . however , when considering gw detectors operating at the hz and mhz bands significant corrections are expected .",
    "we have computed these corrections for every particle in the standard model using the mass values in @xcite and incorporated them to the computed spectra . in fig .",
    "[ fig::spectrum ] we present a typical cosmic string gw spectrum for @xmath61 with the characteristic peak and flat part originating from the loop populations in the matter and radiation eras respectively , along with the corrections to the spectrum due to particle annihilation .",
    "the computation of the tension exclusion curves and upper bounds for a sgwb limit is done using the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "first , we compute the gw spectra of cosmic string models covering all the accessible parameter space .",
    "second , we find which configurations are compliant with the sgwb limit , both in terms of amplitude and assuming a flat local slope . finally , we plot these configurations in the @xmath62 parameter space and the maximum tension allowed for a given @xmath2 limit will provide the tension upper limit .    for a particular experiment , it is essential to determine the range of @xmath3 values which are accessible to it .",
    "the sgwb of cosmic strings can span a wide range of frequencies , from below the nhz regime to beyond a thz , which depends on the size of the loops created by the network .",
    "the minimum frequency @xmath63 of the sgwb is provided by the first emission mode of the loops which are born at @xmath50 , and hence @xmath64 .    in this work",
    ", we will not treat the gw detectors as broadband , but instead we will designate each one a fiducial frequency ; the one at which maximum sensitivity is achieved . for ground - based interferometers ( hereafter , `` hz - detectors '' ) and space - borne interferometers ( hereafter , `` mhz - detectors '' ) , we have assumed fiducial frequencies of @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively . for pta experiments ,",
    "the fiducial frequency is the inverse of the elapsed time over which observations were taken : @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 for 5- , 10- , and 20-year pta experiments respectively .",
    "they can only detect gw emission for @xmath70 , where @xmath71 for a 5-year pta , @xmath72 for a 10-year pta , @xmath73 for a 20-year pta , @xmath74 for mhz - detectors and @xmath75 for hz - detectors .",
    "of course , real detectors are broadband and can observe at higher frequencies than the one that maximum sensitivity is achieved , but , since they are typically only sensitive for a few orders of magnitude in frequency , @xmath76 provides a useful rule - of - thumb .    in fig .",
    "[ fig::exclcurv ] we present the exclusion curves for networks with @xmath77 for three projected limits on @xmath2 at @xmath67 and @xmath78 . in the case of ptas ( upper panel ) , for @xmath79 , the upper limit on @xmath0 is provided by the peak in the mid-@xmath3 region .",
    "the rise in the exclusion curve for @xmath80 is expected , since in that region the detector probes the spectrum at frequencies lower than the peak frequency , with higher values of @xmath0 required for a fixed @xmath2 . for @xmath81 , the characteristic peak disappears and the upper limit on the tension is provided by the models with @xmath82 .    the @xmath2 value at the low frequency cut - off is provided by the loops which are born at the present time and therefore , it will not be stochastic . in reality",
    ", the sgwb is expected to start from a frequency @xmath83 , where the individual loop emission becomes unresolvable , reducing the height of the secondary peak and overestimating the tension constraints for @xmath84 . however , since in that case the spectrum has a positive slope , our assumption for a flat spectrum leads to an underestimation of the tension constraints .",
    "these two effects are expected to be similar and cancel out , preserving the robustness of our results .",
    "the shape of the exclusion curves for hz- and mhz - detectors exhibit a much less prominent mid-@xmath3 peak ( see , for example , fig .",
    "[ fig::exclcurv ] , lower panel ) .",
    "the whole mid-@xmath3 region would be flat if we had not considered the massive particle annihilation corrections ; a result of the fact that such detectors probe only the flat part of the spectrum originating from the radiation era .",
    "moreover , the upper limits on the tension are always provided by the mid-@xmath3 peak since the peak created by the networks with @xmath80 never gets higher .",
    "and various values for the upper limit on @xmath2 at @xmath67 ( upper panel ) and @xmath78 ( lower panel).,width=264 ]",
    "we computed the spectra for @xmath85 different parameter sets ( @xmath86 cpu hours ) , using an updated version of the code used in @xcite .",
    "most changes concern numerical accuracy improvements and the use of the recently published values for the infinite string parameters from @xcite .",
    "a list of all these parameter values along with the value ranges we covered for the fundamental cosmic string model parameters is presented in table  [ tab::params ] .",
    "it is only necessary to use a small number of spectral parameters , since the tension constraints for any @xmath3 in the @xmath87 parameter space will always be provided by the exclusion curves of either the @xmath88 or the @xmath89 models as shown in @xcite .",
    "additionally , we only considered networks with @xmath77 since the final results can be easily rescaled for networks with @xmath90 . for the core results of this paper we used @xmath91 @xcite .",

    "[ fig::cons ] ( left panel ) we present the projected tension constraints as a function of @xmath2 .        for ptas ,",
    "the constraints on the tension are almost independent of the frequency of maximum sensitivity except in the region @xmath108 .",
    "longer duration experiments are preferred in that region than the shorter duration ones .",
    "however , if two such experiments manage to set the same constraint on @xmath2 , the longer duration one will provide better constraints on the string tension in that region .",
    "the better performance of longer duration experiments stems from the lower frequency that they probe with maximum sensitivity , placing them `` deeper '' in the high amplitude , matter era peak of the cosmic string gw spectrum . ] , which is the expected sensitivity to the sgwb for leap @xcite .",
    "the change in the slope of the curve at @xmath109 signifies the point at which the tension upper limit is no longer provided by the mid-@xmath3 peak but instead from the @xmath80 models",
    ". the mhz - detectors will provide weaker constraints on the tension for all @xmath2 values investigated .",
    "the same applies for hz - detector , which will provide weaker constraints than both ptas and mhz - experiments .",
    "the relatively simple origin of the constraint curves makes it possible to describe them with fitting formulae @xmath110 .",
    "this will allow any future constraint on @xmath2 by any experiment operating in the relevant frequency range to be directly connected to a robust constraint on the string tension .",
    "using least squares fitting and setting @xmath111 , we find that :    for 5-year pta experiments , @xmath112    for 10-year pta experiments , @xmath113    for 20-year pta experiments , @xmath114    for mhz - detectors , @xmath115    for hz - detectors , @xmath116    these formulae can be easily adapted to describe cosmic string networks with @xmath117 . in @xcite we have pointed out that a non - zero intercommutation probability only rescales the gw spectrum , @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is an index describing how the intercommutation probability affects the population statistics of infinite strings , and whose value is discussed in @xcite and @xcite",
    ". therefore , eqs .  ,  ,  ,   and   can provide constraints for any possible combination of @xmath12 simply by multiplying the polynomials with @xmath120 .",
    "additionally , we have investigated the effects of varying @xmath20 on the tension constraints .",
    "the value of @xmath20 depends on the trajectory of each loop and is expected to be in the range @xmath121 @xcite .",

    "[ fig::cons ] . in the case of hz- and mhz detectors",
    "the effects of varying @xmath20 do not significantly change the tension constraints .",
    "the same holds true for ptas , except in the region @xmath123 where low values of @xmath20 are equivalent to decreasing the frequency of maximum sensitivity .",
    "we will conclude this section by discussing the consequences of our assumption of a locally flat spectrum . for hz- and mhz - detectors ,",
    "this assumption holds true since these detectors probe the flat part of the spectrum for most of the @xmath62 parameter space . in the case of ptas , the slope will be negative when @xmath79 ( upper limit provided by the mid-@xmath3 peak ) and positive when @xmath84 ( upper limit provided by the peak at @xmath80 ) . in the first case",
    ", the flat spectrum assumption will lead to an underestimation of the constraint .",
    "for example , the epta limit on the string tension of @xcite will provide a hint on the expected discrepancy .",
    "reworking that analysis under the assumption of a flat spectrum we find @xmath124 whereas the limit we acquired using the extra slope information was @xmath16 , a @xmath125 discrepancy .",
    "we anticipate that the projected constraints in the whole range where @xmath79 will be higher by a similar percentage , something that does not affect the robustness of our approach since we are interested in conservative constraints . in the case",
    "where , @xmath126 the constraints are expected to be overestimated by a similar percentage . however , expect that this will be canceled by a similar order underestimation of the constraints in this region due to the assumption of the stochastic nature of the background at @xmath63 , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec::excu ] .",
    "in this paper , we have presented fitting formulae for the upper limits on the cosmic string tension which can be used in future gw detection experiments .",
    "these constraints are free of any assumption on model parameters within the one - scale model .",
    "these formulae provide a conservative alternative to the approach discussed in @xcite which is based on cusp emission and an approximate loop number density , assumptions which are much stronger .",
    "the gw spectum of cosmic strings , being extremely broadband is potentially accessed by every gw detection experiment , with each of them probing bands with different properties .",
    "ptas , probing the high amplitude matter era peak of the spectrum for most cosmic string model parameter combinations and only partially suffering from the massive particle annihilation corrections in the case of large loops , provide an excellent tool to detect strings , or at least , set the most stringent constraints on their tension . on the other side , ground - based interferometers probe a much wider area of the parameter space ( @xmath127 ) making them the only tool able to detect emission from very small loops , and they are not sensitive to the , unknown , details of the radiation spectrum ( @xmath21 and @xmath102 ) .",
    "space - borne interferometers , operating in a frequency range between ptas and ground - based interferometers , share advantages and disadvantages from both .",
    "ptas already set the most stringent constraints on the amplitude of the sgwb when compared to ligo , and advanced ligo which is expected to become operational in 2015 will achieve a similar performance @xcite .",
    "the further increase in the sensitivity of ptas expected in the near future ( leap is expected to set upper limits on @xmath84 ) , will lead to constraints on @xmath128 , with a ska - scale pta experiment improving this by two orders of magnitude .",
