    "transition metal oxides are an ideal laboratory for the study of electronic correlations in solids . in these materials ,",
    "the @xmath4 bands are comparatively narrow with width @xmath5  ev so that electronic correlations , induced by the local coulomb interaction @xmath6  ev , are strong . for @xmath7 , we have a weakly correlated metal and the local density approximation ( lda ) ( see  @xcite for a review ) works . in the opposite limit @xmath8 and for an integer number of @xmath4 electrons",
    ", we have a mott insulator with two separate hubbard bands as described by hubbard s i and iii approximations  @xcite or the lda+u method  @xcite .",
    "transition metals are , however , in the `` in - between '' regime , @xmath9 , where the metallic phase is strongly correlated with coexisting _ quasiparticle _ peak at the fermi level and hubbard side bands .",
    "dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft )  @xcite , a modern , non - perturbative many - body approach , is able to capture the physics in the whole range of parameters from @xmath10 to @xmath8 for model hamiltonians , like the one - band hubbard model ( for an introduction into dmft and its applications see  @xcite ) . and , with the recent merger  @xcite of lda and dmft , we are now able to handle this kind of correlation physics within realistic calculations for transition metal oxides .",
    "a particularly simple transition metal oxide system is ca@xmath11sr@xmath12vo@xmath0 with a @xmath13 electronic configuration and a cubic perovskite lattice structure , which is ideal for srvo@xmath0 and orthorhombically distorted upon increasing the ca - doping @xmath14 .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite initiated the present interest in this 3@xmath15 series , reporting a pronounced lower hubbard band in the photoemission spectra ( pes ) which can not be explained by conventional lda .",
    "subsequently , thermodynamic properties were studied , and the sommerfeld coefficient , resistivity , and paramagnetic susceptibility were found to be essentially independent of @xmath14  @xcite .    on the other hand , pes  @xcite , seemed to imply dramatic differences between cavo@xmath1 and srvo@xmath1 , with cavo@xmath1 having ( almost ) no spectral weight at the fermi energy .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite interpreted these results in terms of the ( dmft ) mott - hubbard transition in the half - filled single - band hubbard model . with the same theoretical ansatz , albeit different parameters , the optical conductivity  @xcite and the pes experiments  @xcite for different dopings @xmath14 were reproduced .",
    "the puzzling discrepancy between these spectroscopic and the thermodynamic measurements , suggesting a mott - hubbard metal - insulator transition or not , were resolved recently by bulk - sensitive pes obtained by maiti  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and sekiyama  _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite . in the latter work",
    "it was shown that ( i ) the technique of preparing the sample surface ( which should preferably be done by fracturing ) is very important , and that ( ii ) the energy of the x - ray beam should be large enough to increase the photoelectron escape depth to achieve bulk - sensitivity . theoretically , pronounced differences between srvo@xmath0 surface and bulk spectra were reported by liebsch @xcite .",
    "besides bulk - sensitivity , the beam should provide a high instrumental resolution ( about 100  mev in  @xcite ) . with these experimental improvements , the pes of srvo@xmath1 and cavo@xmath1",
    "were found to be almost identical  @xcite , implying consistency of spectroscopic and thermodynamic results at last .",

    "@xcite    in this paper we present details of our lda+dmft calculation @xcite which could not be included in the joint letter @xcite .",
    "in particular , we discuss the crystal structure of srvo@xmath0 and cavo@xmath0 , explain the origin of the surprisingly small change in bandwidth of these two systems , and compare the calculated spectrum for energies @xmath3 with xas  data @xcite .",
    "we start with discussing the structural differences between srvo@xmath0 and cavo@xmath0 in section  [ struct ] , based on the most recent crystallographic data provided by inoue  @xcite . how these differences reflect in the lda results",
    "is shown in section  [ lda_res ] , before we turn to the lda+dmft scheme in sections  [ dmft ] and the effects of electronic correlations in section [ dmft_res ] .",
    "section  [ conc ] concludes our presentation .",
    "both srvo@xmath0 and cavo@xmath0 are perovskites , with srvo@xmath0 in the ideal cubic structure pm@xmath17 m  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ sr_crystal ] ) and cavo@xmath0 in the orthorhombicaly distorted ( gdfeo@xmath0 ) pbnm structure  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ ca_crystal ] ) .",
    "the ideal cubic structure of srvo@xmath0 implies that the vo@xmath18 octahedra , the main structural elements of the crystal , are not distorted : the v - o@xmath19 and v - o@xmath20 distances are the same , the o@xmath20-v - o@xmath19 and o@xmath19-v - o@xmath19 angles are 90@xmath21 , and the v - o - v bond angles are exactly 180@xmath21 .",
    "the substitution of the large sr@xmath22 ions by smaller ca@xmath22 ions leads to a tilting , rotation , and distortion of the vo@xmath18 octahedra . nonetheless , in cavo@xmath0 , both the v - o@xmath19 and the v - o@xmath20 distances are practically the same .",
    "therefore , the most important feature of the distortion is the change of the v - o@xmath19-v and v - o@xmath20-v angles , which determines the strength of the effective v3@xmath23-v3@xmath23 hybridization and , hence , the bandwidth . due to the rotation and tilting of the octahedra",
    "both angles ( one of them is marked as @xmath24123 in figs .",
    "[ sr_crystal ] and [ ca_crystal ] ) have the same value @xmath25 for srvo@xmath0 and @xmath26 , @xmath27for cavo@xmath0 .",
    "the valence states of srvo@xmath0 and cavo@xmath0 consist of completely occupied oxygen 2@xmath28 bands and partially occupied v 3@xmath23 bands .",
    "since the v ion has a formal oxidation of 4 + , there is one electron per v ion occupying the @xmath23-states ( configuration @xmath29 ) . in figs .",
    "[ fig_lda1a ] and  [ fig_lda1b ] the lda density of states ( dos ) are presented for both compounds , as calculated by the linearized muffin - tin orbitals method ( lmto )  @xcite with an orthogonal basis set of sr(@xmath30 ) , ca(@xmath31 ) , v(@xmath31 ) , and o(@xmath32 ) orbitals  @xcite .",
    "these results are in agreement with previous lda calculations in the basis of augmented plane waves ( apw ) by tagekahara @xcite . for a combination of the lda band structure with many - body techniques  @xcite however , the atomic - like lmto wave functions employed here are particularly convenient . as is apparent from figs .",
    "[ fig_lda1a ] and [ fig_lda1b ] , the o-2@xmath28 states lie between -7.5ev and -2.0ev in srvo@xmath0 and between -6.5ev and -1.5ev in cavo@xmath0 .",
    "the 3@xmath23 states of v are located between -1.1ev and 6.5ev in srvo@xmath0 and between -1.0ev and 6.5ev in cavo@xmath0 .",
    "these results are in agreement with previous lda calculations in the basis of augmented plane waves ( apw ) by tagekahara @xcite , but for our purposes lmto is more appropriate .    in both compounds ,",
    "the v ions are in a octahedral coordination of oxygen ions .",
    "the octahedral crystal field splits the v-3@xmath23 states into three t@xmath33 orbitals and two e@xmath34 orbitals . in the cubic symmetry of srvo@xmath0 ,",
    "hybridization between t@xmath33 and e@xmath34 states is forbidden , and the orbitals within both subbands are degenerate .",
    "in contrast , the distorted orthorhombic structure of cavo@xmath0 allows them to mix and the degeneracy is lifted . in the lower part of figs .",
    "[ fig_lda1a ] and [ fig_lda1b ] , we present these t@xmath33 and e@xmath34 subbands of the v-3@xmath23 band . for both sr and ca compounds ,",
    "the reader can see an admixture of these vanadium t@xmath33 and e@xmath34 states to the oxygen 2@xmath28 states in the energy region [ -8@xmath35ev,-2@xmath35ev ] .",
    "this is due to hybridization and amounts to 12% and 15% of the total t@xmath33 weight for srvo@xmath0 and cavo@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the main t@xmath33 ( e@xmath34 ) weight lies in the energy region [ -1.1@xmath35ev,1.5@xmath35ev ] ( [ 0.0@xmath35ev,6.5@xmath35ev ] ) in srvo@xmath0 and [ -1.0@xmath35ev,1.5@xmath35ev ] ( [ 0.2@xmath35ev,6.5@xmath35ev ] ) in cavo@xmath0 . since the energy difference between the centers of gravities of the t@xmath33 and e@xmath34 subbands is comparable with the bandwidth , t@xmath33 and",
    "e@xmath34 states can be considered as sufficiently separated in both compounds .",
    "let us now concentrate on the t@xmath33 orbitals crossing the fermi energy and compare the lda t@xmath33 dos of srvo@xmath1 and cavo@xmath1 .",
    "most importantly , the one - electron t@xmath33 lda bandwidth of cavo@xmath1 , defined as the energy interval where the t@xmath33 dos in figs .  [ fig_lda1a ] and [ fig_lda1b ] is non - zero , is found to be only 4% smaller than that of srvo@xmath1 ( @xmath36  ev , @xmath37  ev ) ; in general agreement with other lda calculations @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the expectation that the strong lattice distortion with a decrease of the v - o - v bond angle from 180@xmath38 to 162@xmath38 affects the t@xmath33 bandwidth much more strongly .",
    "such a larger effect indeed occurs in the e@xmath39 bands for which the bandwidth is reduced by 10% . to physically understand the smallness of the narrowing of the t@xmath33 bands we have investigated a larger hamiltonian consisting of e@xmath39 , t@xmath33 , and oxygen @xmath28 orbitals .",
    "we calculated the overall direct @xmath40 and the indirect @xmath41 hopping for this larger hamiltonian .",
    "the predominant contribution to the e@xmath39-e@xmath39 hopping is through a @xmath41 hybridization , which is considerably decreasing with the lattice distortion .",
    "this is also the case for the @xmath42 orbitals .",
    "however , for the @xmath42 orbitals , the direct @xmath40 hybridization is also important .",
    "this hybridization _ increases _ with the distortion since the @xmath42 orbital lobes point more directly towards each other in the distorted structure . hopping parameters for individual orbitals change rather substantially from srvo@xmath0 to cavo@xmath0 .",
    "but , altogether , a decreasing @xmath41 hybridization and an increasing @xmath40 hybridization results in a very small change of the t@xmath33 bandwidth .",
    "as is well - known , lda does not treat the effects of strong local coulomb correlations adequately . to overcome this drawback , we use lda+dmft as a non - perturbative approach to study strongly correlated systems  @xcite .",
    "it combines the strength of the lda in describing weakly correlated electrons in the @xmath43- and @xmath28-orbitals , with the dmft treatment of the dynamics due to local coulomb interactions . in the present paper",
    "we will discuss the relevant parts of the lda+dmft approach only briefly , refering the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "the lda+dmft hamiltonian can be written as @xmath44 here , the index @xmath45 enumerates the v sites , @xmath46 the individual t@xmath33 orbitals and @xmath47 the spin .",
    "@xmath48 is the one - particle hamiltonian generated from the lda band structure with an averaged coulomb interaction subtracted to account for double counting  @xcite ; @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote the local intra - orbital and inter - orbital coulomb repulsions , and @xmath51 is the exchange interaction .",
    "we calculated these interaction strengths by means of the constrained lda method  @xcite for srvo@xmath0 , allowing the e@xmath39 states to participate in screening  @xcite .",
    "the resulting value of the averaged coulomb interaction is @xmath52  ev ( @xmath53 for t@xmath54 orbitals  @xcite ) and @xmath55  ev . the intra - orbital coulomb repulsion @xmath49 is then fixed by rotational invariance to @xmath56  ev .",
    "we did not calculate @xmath57 for cavo@xmath1 because the standard procedure to calculate the coulomb interaction parameter between two t@xmath54 electrons , screened by e@xmath39 states , is not applicable for the distorted crystal structure where the e@xmath39 and t@xmath33 orbitals are not separated by symmetry . on the other hand , it is well - known that the change of the _ local _ coulomb interaction is typically much smaller than the change in the dos , which was found to depend only very weakly on the bond angle .",
    "that means that @xmath57 for cavo@xmath1 should be nearly the same as for srvo@xmath1 .",
    "therefore we used @xmath52  ev and @xmath55  ev for both srvo@xmath1 and cavo@xmath1 .",
    "this is also in agreement with previous calculations of vanadium systems  @xcite and experiments @xcite .",
    "dmft maps the lattice problem eq.([h ] ) onto a self - consistent auxiliary impurity problem , which is here solved numerically by the quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) technique @xcite .",
    "combined with the maximum entropy method  @xcite , this technique allows us to calculate spectral functions @xcite .",
    "a computationally important simplification is due to the fact that , in ideal cubic perovskites , the ( degenerate ) t@xmath33 states do not mix with the ( degenerate ) e@xmath34 states . in this particular case ,",
    "the self - energy matrix @xmath58 is diagonal with respect to the orbital indices . under this condition",
    ", the green functions @xmath59 of the lattice problem can be expressed in the dmft self - consistency equation by the hilbert transform of the non - interacting dos @xmath60 : @xmath61 this procedure avoids the rather cumbersome and problematic @xmath62-integration over the brillouin zone by the analytical tetrahedron method  @xcite .",
    "we obtain @xmath63 for srvo@xmath0 and cavo@xmath0 from the @xmath42-projected dos of figs .",
    "[ fig_lda1a ] and [ fig_lda1b ] by truncating the contribution in the oxygen range below -1.5@xmath35ev and multiplying by a renormalization factor ( to have maximally one electron per site and orbital ) .",
    "this procedure is employed as it resembles the three _ effective _ bands of @xmath42 character which cross the fermi energy and are , hence , responsible for the low - energy physics .",
    "the calculated lda+dmft(qmc ) spectra for srvo@xmath1 ( right panel ) and cavo@xmath1 ( left panel ) are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_ldadmft ] for different temperatures . due to genuine correlation effects ,",
    "a lower hubbard band at about @xmath64  ev and an upper hubbard band at about @xmath65  ev is formed , with a well pronounced quasiparticle peak at the fermi energy . the 4% difference in the lda bandwidth between srvo@xmath1 and cavo@xmath1",
    "is only reflected in some additional transfer of spectral weight from the quasiparticle peak to the hubbard bands , and minor differences in the positions of the hubbard bands .",
    "clearly , the two systems are not on the verge of a mott - hubbard metal - insulator transition . both , srvo@xmath1 and cavo@xmath1 , are strongly correlated metals , though srvo@xmath1 is slightly less correlated than cavo@xmath1 with somewhat more quasiparticle weight , in accord with their different lda bandwidth",
    ". as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig_ldadmft ] , the effect of temperature on the spectrum is small for @xmath66  k.    in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_xps ] , we compare our lda+dmft spectra ( 300k ) , which were multiplied with the fermi function at the experimental temperature ( 20@xmath35k ) and gauss broadened with the experimental resolution of @xmath67ev @xcite with the experimental pes data obtained by subtracting the experimentally estimated surface and oxygen contributions . due to the high photon energy ( several hundred ev )",
    "@xcite , the pes transition matrix elements will have _ no _ strong energy dependence in the energy interval of a few ev studied here , which justifyies that we do not take such matrix elements into account .",
    "the quasiparticle peaks in theory and experiment are seen to be in very good agreement . in particular ,",
    "their heights and widths are almost identical for both srvo@xmath1 and cavo@xmath1 .",
    "the difference in the positions of the lower hubbard bands may be partly due to ( i ) the subtraction of the ( estimated ) oxygen contribution which might also remove some @xmath4 spectral weight below @xmath68  ev , and ( ii ) uncertainties in the _ ab - initio _ calculation of @xmath57 .",
    "since inverse photoemission spectroscopy ( ipes ) data for srvo@xmath1 and cavo@xmath1 are not yet available we compare @xcite the calculated spectrum for energies @xmath3 with xas data by inoue _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_xps ] ) .",
    "we consider core - hole life time effects by lorentz broadening the spectrum with 0.2  ev  @xcite , multiply with the inverse fermi function ( 80k ) , and apply gauss broadening given by the experimental resolution of @xmath69ev  @xcite .",
    "again , the overall agreement of the weights and positions of the quasiparticle and upper @xmath42 hubbard band is good , including the tendencies when going from srvo@xmath1 to cavo@xmath1 . for cavo@xmath1 ( ca@xmath70sr@xmath71vo@xmath1 in the experiment )",
    ", the lda+dmft quasiparticle weight is somewhat lower than in experiment .",
    "in contrast to one - band hubbard model calculations , our material specific results reproduce the strong asymmetry around the fermi energy w.r.t .",
    "weights and bandwidths .",
    "our results also give a different interpretation of the xas than in  @xcite where the maximum at about @xmath72ev was attributed solely to the @xmath73 band .",
    "we find that also the @xmath42 upper hubbard band contributes in this energy range .",
    "the slight differences in the quasiparticle peaks ( see fig .  [ fig_ldadmft ] ) lead to different effective masses , namely @xmath74 for srvo@xmath1 and @xmath75 for cavo@xmath1 .",
    "these theoretical values agree with @xmath76 for srvo@xmath1 and cavo@xmath1 as obtained from de haas - van alphen experiments and thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "we note that the effective mass of cavo@xmath1 obtained from optical experiments is somewhat larger , i.e. , @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "in summary , we investigated the spectral properties of the correlated 3@xmath15 systems srvo@xmath1 and cavo@xmath1 within the lda+dmft(qmc ) approach .",
    "constrained lda was used to determine the average coulomb interaction as @xmath78  ev and the exchange coupling as @xmath79  ev . with this input we calculated the spectra of the two systems in a parameter - free way .",
    "both systems are found to be strongly correlated metals , with a transfer of the majority of the spectral weight from the quasiparticle peak to the incoherent upper and lower hubbard bands .",
    "the calculated dmft spectra of srvo@xmath1 and cavo@xmath1 , and in particular the quasiparticle parts , are found to be very similar , differences being slightly more pronounced at energies above the fermi energy .",
    "our calculated spectra agree very well with recent bulk - sensitive high - resolution pes @xcite and xas @xcite data , i.e. , with the experimental spectrum below _ and _ above the fermi energy .",
    "both compounds are similarly strongly correlated metals ; cavo@xmath1 is not on the verge of a mott - hubbard transition .",
    "our results are in contrast to previous theories and the expectation that the strong lattice distortion leads to a strong narrowing of the cavo@xmath1 bandwidth and , hence , to much stronger correlation effects in cavo@xmath1 .",
    "while the e@xmath34 bands indeed narrow considerably , the competition between decreasing @xmath41 and increasing @xmath40 hybridization leads to a rather insignificant narrowing of the t@xmath33 bands at the fermi energy .",
    "this explains why the k - integrated spectral functions of cavo@xmath1 and srvo@xmath1 are so similar . with our theoretical results confirming the new pes and xas experiments , we conclude that the insulating - like behavior observed in earlier pes and bis experiments on cavo@xmath1",
    "must be attributed to surface effects  @xcite .",
