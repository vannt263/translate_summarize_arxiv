    "luminous blue variables are hot massive stars which undergo sporadic eruptions on timescales of years and decades @xcite .",
    "the prototype is s doradus , as well as hubble - sandage variables in m31 and m33 @xcite , which shows eruptions of 1 - 2 magnitude level in a time - span of several decades .",
    "other examples are @xmath1 carina and p cygni , which show giant eruptions ( @xmath2 2 mag ) at a frequency of several centuries .",
    "@xcite is the first to coin the name luminous blue variables for this type of stars , and separates them from other type of bright blue stars like wolf - rayet stars .",
    "lbvs play an important role at the very late stage of massive star evolution .",
    "they are considered as a transition phase where o stars evolve toward wolf - rayet stars .",
    "lbvs were originally regarded only as supernova impostors because they often show giant eruptions mimicking the explosion of supernovae , but the central star remains after the ejecta have been expelled .",
    "however , a link between lbvs and supernova progenitors was suggested by when interpreting the radio lightcurves of supernovae . the radio emission seen after the supernova explosion is induced by the interaction between supernova ejecta and the progenitor s circumstellar medium , thus radio",
    "lightcurves bear information on the mass - loss history of the progenitor . suggested that radio lightcurves of sne indicate high mass - loss histories of the progenitors which matches well with lbvs .",
    "pre - eruption images of several sne also suggest lbvs as their progenitor .",
    "for example , the progenitor of sn 1987a was recognized as a blue supergiant @xcite and @xcite suggested that it could be classified as a low - luminosity lbv .",
    "@xcite identified the progenitor of sn 2005gl using _ hst _ and attributed it to be a lbv . recently",
    "a previously known lbv - sn 2009ip - has undergone its third eruption and has been linked to a true supernova @xcite .",
    "the nature of the recent eruption of sn 2009ip is under debate ; subsequent follow - up has been carried out to verify or reject it as a core - collapse sn @xcite .",
    "yet there are only a few known lbvs , either in our galaxy or in m31 and m33 .",
    "thus , increasing the number of known lbvs is essential toward understanding their nature and evolution .",
    "in addition to the pioneering decades - long photometric monitoring campaign conducted by hubble and sandage @xcite , there are several methods to uncover lbvs .",
    "for example , lbvs are strong uv and h - alpha emitters ( see * ? ? ? * and reference therein ) and can be revealed e.g. with observations of the _ galex _ satellite or h - alpha surveys .",
    "@xcite conducted a h - alpha survey of m31 and m33 and followed - up a selected sample of strong h - alpha emitters spectroscopically . by comparing the spectra of their h - alpha emitter sample with known lbvs , they were able to identify candidate lbvs , which saved a substantial amount of time required to uncover lbvs photometrically .",
    "because they have uncovered more than 2,500 h - alpha emitting stellar objects , they can only follow - up dozens of them , yet there are much more to be explored .",
    "@xcite are currently exploring other h - alpha emitting sources in this list , in combination with infrared photometry including 2mass , _ spitzer _ and _ wise _ to search for luminous and variable stars .",
    "since lbvs undergo several eruptions and exhibit high mass - loss rates , they accumulate vast amounts of material in their circumstellar environment which could be detectable in the infrared ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have made use of _ spitzer _ irac photometry and searched for @xmath1 carina analogs in nearby galaxies including m33 ( but not m31 ) .",
    "they estimate that 6@xmath36 of their candidates are true @xmath1 carina - like sources .    here",
    "we outlined a novel approach utilizing mid - term photometric variation , as well as optical and infrared color to search for lbvs using the lggs optical and 2mass infrared photometry , with the combination of the photometric variability from pandromeda monitoring campaign .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in  2 we describe the optical and infrared data we use . in",
    "3 we outline our method .",
    "a discussion of our candidates is presented in  4 , followed by an outlook in  5 .",
    "the time - series photometric data employed to search for variability are from the pandromeda project .",
    "pandromeda monitored the andromeda galaxy with the 1.8 m ps1 telescope with a @xmath4 7 deg@xmath5 field - of - view ( see * ? ? ?",

    "observations have been taken in the @xmath0 and @xmath6 filters on daily basis during july to december between 2010 and 2012 in order to search for microlensing events and variables .",
    "the distribution of the observations in the @xmath0-filter is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.cadence ] .",
    "several exposures in @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are also taken as complementary information for studies of the stellar content of m31 .",
    "the data reduction is based on the mdia tool @xcite and is explained in @xcite in detail .",
    "we outline our data reduction steps as follows .",
    "the raw data are detrended by the image processing pipeline ( ipp , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and warped to a sky - based image plane ( so - called skycells ) .",
    "the images at the skycell stage are further analyzed by our sophisticated imaging subtraction pipeline _",
    "mupipe _ based on the idea of image differencing analysis advocated by @xcite .",
    "this includes the creation of deep reference images from best seeing data , stacking of observations within one visit to have better signal to noise ratio ( hereafter `` visit stacks '' ) , subtraction of visit stacks from the reference images to search for variabilities , and creating lightcurves from the subtracted images .",
    "we have shown in @xcite how to obtain lightcurves for resolved sources from the pandromeda data .",
    "the major difference of the data used in this work is that our present data - set contains three years of pandromeda data , instead of one year and a few days from the second year data used in @xcite .",
    "the sky tessellation is also different , in order to have the central region of m31 in the center of a skycell ( skycell 045 ) , instead of at the corner of adjacent skycells ( skycell number 065 , 066 , 077 , and 078 ) as in @xcite ; the skycells are larger and overlap in the new tessellation .",
    "the new tessellation is drawn in fig . 1 of @xcite .",
    "we have extended the analysis to 47 skycells , twice as many as the number of skycells used in @xcite .",
    "the skycells we used are 012 - 017 , 022 - 028 , 032 - 038 , 042 - 048 , 052 - 058 , 062 - 068 , 072 - 077 , which cover an area of 7 deg@xmath5 of m31 .",
    "the search of variability is conducted in both @xmath0 and @xmath6 , where we start from the resolved sources in the @xmath0 reference images , and check for variability in both @xmath0 and @xmath6 filters .",
    "in addition , we also use the deep photometric catalog from the local group galaxy survey ( lggs , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the lggs utilized the 4-meter kpno telescope to observe the m31 galaxy .",
    "their mosaic ccd camera has a resolution of 0.261 / pixel at the center which decreases to 0.245 / pixel towards the corner .",
    "the field - of - view of the camera is roughly 36 @xmath10 36. m31 was observed between 2000 and 2002 in johnson _ ubvri _ filters with seeing values from 0.8 to 1.4 .",
    "the observations cover ten fields , corresponding to 2.2 deg@xmath5 along the major axis of m31 ( see fig",

    "the astrometric solution for each frame was derived by matching with the usno - b1.0 catalog @xcite .",
    "the _ psf _",
    "photometry in each filter was obtained with the iraf daophot routine , and calibrated against the lowell 1.1 m data with zero points and color terms .",
    "the final lggs catalog contains 371,781 stars in m31 , with 1 - 2 percent statistic error at 21 mag and 10 percent at 23 mag .",
    "when matching the lggs catalog to the pandromeda catalog , we found an median astrometric difference of 0.36 arcsec .      in this work",
    "we utilize the catalog and images delivered by the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass , * ? ? ?",
    "2mass employed two 1.3-meter telescopes located at mt .",

    "m ) , h(1.65@xmath11 m ) , and k@xmath12(2.16@xmath11 m ) simultaneously .",
    "the pixel scale of the 2mass ccds is 2 arcsec / pixel .",
    "2mass observed every patch of the sky with six times 1.3 s integration time .",
    "the raw images were dark subtracted , flat - fielded , sky subtracted , resampled to a 1 arcsec /pixel coordinate grid in a flux - conserving manner , and coadded to generate an atlas image .",
    "the source detection was performed on the atlas images with psf profile - fitting , yielding a sensitivity of 15.8 , 15.1 , and 14.3 mag at 10 @xmath13 level in j , h , and k@xmath12 band , respectively .",
    "the astrometry was calibrated against the tyco-2 reference catalog and yielded an order of 100 mas accuracy for bright sources .",
    "we queried the 2mass point - source catalog for a 3 @xmath10 3 deg@xmath5 area centered at m31 via the nasa / ipac infrared science archive , and retrieved 43,723 sources in this region .",
    "in addition , we also retrieved postage - stamp images from irsa to examine the sources .",
    "we designed our selection algorithm based on the optical and infrared properties of known lbvs .",
    "the first criterion is the optical color . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig.criteria_vbv ] , the known lbvs and lbv candidates presented by @xcite are rather blue in the b - v v.s . v color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "we thus set the criterion that b - v @xmath14 0.5 mag and v brighter than 20 mag to select for optically blue and luminous objects .",
    "this enables us to filter out possible contaminations from foreground stars and unresolved background galaxies .",
    "the next criterion utilizes the optical variability from pandromeda data .",
    "since ob stars also show aperiodic variation at @xmath14 0.1 magnitude level - the so - called @xmath15 cyg variables - and since have accounted for variation @xmath16 0.4 magnitude in their m33 lbv candidates as by similar mechanism , we require lightcurve variations @xmath2 0.4 mag from @xmath0 to secure mid - term lbv variability . loosing this criterion might help to gain more candidates",
    ". we will come to this point in section [ sec.det_eff ] .",
    "sometimes there are a few data points with huge error - bars which deviate from other observations .",
    "such outlier measurements could render a lightcurve with @xmath17 mag @xmath2 0.4 and leads to false detection . to reduce the number of false detection",
    ", we thus require that in a single lightcurve , at least 25 data points vary at 10-@xmath13 level with respect to the mean value from all the measurements .",
    "the last criterion is set by the infrared color .",
    "@xcite have indicated that b[e ] super giants ( b[e]sgs ) also show variabilities similar to lbvs , and pointed out that lbvs and b[e]sgs can be distinguished from the infrared colors as shown in a recent study by using samples from the milky way and the magallanic clouds .",
    "we plot the sample of in fig .",
    "[ fig.jhk ] , as well as the four known lbvs in m31 .",
    "the m31 lbvs follow the distribution of galactic lbvs ; most of them have h - k @xmath14 0.5 .",
    "we thus set a upper h - k limit of 0.5 to select candidate lbvs .",
    "there are seven sources pass the aforementioned criteria .",
    "we inspect their lightcurves individually and select four as candidate lbvs . for the remaining three sources ,",
    "they are all known lbvs ( ae and , m31 var 15 , and m31 var a-1 ) .",
    "the only known lbv that does not pass our selection criteria is af and , due to its variability smaller than the 0.4 mag criterion ( 0.375 ) during the time - span of ps1 .",
