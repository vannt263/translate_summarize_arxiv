    "one could think that the best way to retrieve such a simple information has been found years ago .",
    "however , we have proven recently that the detection devices which are traditionally used - split and quadrant detectors - are limited to an efficiency of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this is a question of potentially great interest as they are used in many ultra sensitive applications including optical tweezers , atomic force microscopes , beam positioning for gravitational wave detectors and satellite alignment @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the best possible measurements of beam displacement and tilt , for a given beam power and shape .",
    "note that similar issues are addressed on the limits to the measurement of beam rotation about its propagation axis in reference @xcite .",
    "we will first focus on the detection device , and will therefore analyse experimentally a split - detection and a homodyne detection scheme with a tem@xmath0 local oscillator ( see fig .",
    "[ intro ] ) , introduced theoretically in reference @xcite . at the same time , we will present measurements of the quantum conjugated variable of the transverse displacement of the beam , the laser beam tilt @xcite .",
    "finally , we will focus on the laser beam itself , and show measurements beyond the fundamental limit imposed by the photon statistics of laser beams , using non classical beams .",
    "this demonstration allows displacement and tilt measurements that were masked or altered by quantum noise .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way .",
    "we first give a brief definition of displacement and tilt of a tem@xmath2 mode beam , and introduce the notions of position and momentum of a gaussian beam , which are two conjugate transverse observables .",
    "in section [ qnl ] , we quantitatively discuss the qnl for displacement and tilt measurements and show the improvement that can be achieved with squeezed light . in section [ split ] , we present how this new set of quantum variables can be accessed with a split detection , the conventional scheme used for beam displacement measurements .",
    "the results obtained provide a reference for a homodyne detector with a tem@xmath0 local oscillator presented in section [ homodyne ] . in section [ sqz ] ,",
    "we show how to perform sub qnl measurements with both schemes and present experimental homodyne detection results in this regime . in the last section ,",

    "local oscillator - to retrieve displacement and tilt of a gaussian beam .",
    "we show how to modify the input beam using quantum correlations to perform measurements beyond the quantum noise limit.*,width=302 ]",
    "displacement and tilt of a single - mode tem@xmath2 laser beam are very intuitive notions , they refer to macroscopic properties of a beam , as shown in figure ( [ d_and_t ] ) .",
    "we assume here that the beam is constrained to one dimension , namely the figure plane of the paper , considering that the non represented transverse component is gaussian .",
    "a displacement corresponds to a translation of the beam by a distance @xmath4 along the transverse direction , whereas a tilt corresponds to a rotation of the propagation axis by an angle @xmath5 .",
    "the tilt of a laser beam is linked to the transverse momentum of the beam , in the limit of small angles , given by the following expression @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the optical wavelength .",
    "note that displacement and tilt are defined relative to a particular transverse reference plane .",
    "for instance , in figure ( [ d_and_t ] ) , we have chosen the beam waist plane as reference transverse plane .",
    "-dimensional case , the displacement @xmath4 corresponds to a translation of the beam in the transverse direction .",
    "the tilt @xmath5 corresponds to a rotation of the propagation axis .",
    "* , width=302 ]    in the case of small displacement and tilt , i.e. for @xmath8 and @xmath9 - where @xmath10 is the beam waist of the incident tem@xmath2 mode , we can taylor expand the displaced @xmath11 and tilted @xmath12 gaussian field to first order , yielding @xcite @xmath13 the equations can be rewritten into @xmath14,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 refers to the hermite gauss @xmath16 mode @xcite .",

    "( [ field1 ] ) shows that the information of displacement and tilt of a tem@xmath2 laser beam can be extracted by measuring the tem@xmath0 mode component of the field .",
    "any displacement modulation is transferred to the in - phase amplitude of the tem@xmath0 mode relative to the `` carrier '' ( tem@xmath2 mode ) , whereas any tilt modulation is transferred to the tem@xmath0 component in quadrature relative to the tem@xmath2 mode .    in order to give a quantum mechanical description of displacement and tilt of a laser beam , we need to take into account the quantum noise of all the optical modes of the beam , including the vacuum modes",
    ". we can write the positive frequency part of the electric field operator in terms of photon annihilation operators @xmath19 .",

    "the use of classical resources ( i.e. coherent laser beams ) sets a lower bound to detection performances , which is called the quantum noise limit ( qnl ) and arises from the random time arrival of photons on the detector . in the case of displacement measurement of a laser beam",
    ", the transverse displacement @xmath39 of a tem@xmath2 laser beam corresponding to a signal to noise ratio ( snr ) of @xmath40 , is found to be @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath10 is the waist of the beam , and @xmath28 its total number of photons detected in the interval @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the resolution bandwidth .",
    "ideally , @xmath22 is maximized according to the stability of the physical system .",
    "for instance in the case of bits read - out in optical disc devices , @xmath43 roughly corresponds to the scanning frequency . for a @xmath44 m waist , @xmath45mw of power at a wavelength of @xmath46 m , with @xmath47khz ,",
    "the quantum noise limit is for instance given by @xmath48 nm .",
    "note that during test or characterization procedures , the precision can be increased by averaging with the spectrum analyzer , for instance by reducing the video bandwidth ( vbw ) .",
    "the qnl effectively corresponds to the minimum measurable displacement when @xmath49 , without averaging .",
    "similarly , the qnl for momentum measurements can be defined as @xmath50 in the same conditions as the ones defined above , the qnl for momentum measurement is @xmath51m@xmath52 , corresponding to a tilt angle of @xmath53rad .    in order to perform measurements beyond the qnl , i.e. for a given @xmath22 , we have shown in reference @xcite that filling the appropriate transverse mode of the input field with squeezed light is a necessary and sufficient condition .",
    "we call this mode the noise - mode of detection @xcite .    for example , using @xmath54db of squeezing in the appropriate component of the beam for a displacement measurement leads to a noise reduction of a factor 2 . the snr is quadratic in @xmath4 as the signal corresponds to the intensity of the tem@xmath0 component of the displaced field , and the new quantum limit is thus given by @xmath55 .",
    "it is important to note that , as imposed by heisenberg inequalities , the measurement of the conjugated observable - the momentum in this case - is degraded .",
    "the conventional way to measure the displacement of a laser beam is to use a split detector .",
    "as shown in figure ( [ d_and_t_with_sd2]a ) , the difference between the intensity on each side of the split detector yields a photocurrent proportional to the displacement .",
    "this technique is widely used notably for beam alignments , particle tracking and atomic force microscopy .",
    "nevertheless , such a detection device only accesses the beam position in the detector plane , and is totally insensitive to the orientation of the propagation axis of the beam ( i.e. tilt ) .",

    "the displacement and tilt ratio varies along @xmath56 because of the gouy phase shift ( i.e. diffraction ) , up to be perfectly inverted in the far field where @xmath62 .",
    "this fourier transform relation is a well known result in classical optics , for which a displacement in the focal plane of a simple lens is changed into an inclination relative to the propagation axis .",
    "therefore , if the exact amount of tilt and displacement is needed in a particular transverse plane , for instance at @xmath63 , displacement can be measured in this plane ( or in its near field ) , whereas tilt can only be accessed in its far field , as presented in figure ( [ d_and_t_with_sd2]b ) .",

    "scanning the local oscillator phase allows to measure all the quadratures of the displacement and tilt modulation .",
    "we have omitted the gouy phase shift in the previous expression , as it can be incorporated as a constant term in the local oscillator phase .",

    "only the tem@xmath0 mode of the incoming beam contributes to the noise , as it matches the local oscillator transverse shape .",

    "the tem@xmath0 mode is thus the noise mode of the homodyne detection , and precisely matches the information to be extracted .",
    "we can show , using a cramer rao bound estimation , that the tem@xmath0 homodyne detection is an optimal displacement and tilt detection , as no other device can possibly perform such measurements with a better snr @xcite .",
    "for a coherent incoming tem@xmath0 mode , the previous noise term defines the shot noise level , and is equal to @xmath40 . using squeezed light in the tem@xmath0 mode component of the incoming beam would result in noise reduction , and will be discussed in the section [ sqz ] .",

    "[ v2hd ] in the homodyne detection case @xmath102 comparing the split and homodyne detections schemes yields certain similarities between eq.([v2sd ] ) and ( [ v2hd ] ) .",

    "[ v2sd ] can be much bigger in the homodyne detection case , as it corresponds to the local oscillator intensity instead of the input beam intensity in the split detection case .",
    "it is thus easier to have more electronic noise clearance in the homodyne case .    in this section ,",
    "we have shown - still theoretically - how to retrieve displacement and tilt using a homodyne detector with a tem@xmath0 local oscillator . moreover , we have proved a @xmath110 theoretical improvement of this scheme compared to the split detection .",
    "when the information to be retrieved is below - or of the order of - the quantum noise , non classical resources ( i.e. squeezed laser beams ) can help extracting the information .",
    "for each type of detection ( i.e homodyne- and split detection ) , the only transverse mode component within the incident field which contributes to the noise has been identified in the previous sections .",
    "the noise modes of the split and homodyne detection are the flipped mode and the tem@xmath0 mode , respectively .",
    "since displacement and tilt of a tem@xmath2 beam lies in the tem@xmath0 component of the beam , noise mode and information encoded are matched for the homodyne detection only , accounting for the non optimal split detection .",
    "sub shot noise measurements with both schemes can be performed using the setups shown in fig .",
    "[ sd_and_hd_scheme ] , by filling the noise mode of the input beam with squeezed light .",
    "a mode combiner has to be used to merge the signal beam - in our case a bright tem@xmath2 beam - with the noise mode of detection , filled with squeezed vacuum .",
    "note that it has to be a vacuum mode , or a very dim field not to contribute to the signal , but only to reduce the quantum noise properties .",
    "the combination of beams can not be done with a sheer beam - splitter as the squeezing is not robust to losses .",
    "instead , we used a special mach - zehnder interferometer with an additional mirror in one arm , see ( fig .",
    "[ sd_and_hd_scheme ] ) .",
    "this mirror has no effect on even transverse profiles , but induces an additional @xmath72 phase shift to odd transverse profiles .",
    "therefore , thanks to this asymmetry , orthogonal even and odd modes , which are incident on the two input ports of the mach - zehnder , interfere constructively on the same output port without experiencing any losses .",

    "in addition to a simple comparison involving only classical resources , we designed the experience in order to allow measurements beyond the qnl . at this stage , we were unable to produce directly a squeezed tem@xmath0 mode , we have therefore chosen to generate a squeezed flipped mode , which also corresponds to a squeezed tem@xmath0 mode having experienced @xmath111 losses .        indeed , the amount of squeezing in the amplitude quadrature of the tem@xmath0 component of the flipped mode can be deduced from @xmath112 as all the modes except the flipped mode are filled with coherent light . if the flipped mode is a classical coherent beam , @xmath113 , which also implies that the tem@xmath0 component is coherent @xmath114 , as expected . in the end , if we start with @xmath115db of squeezing in the amplitude quadrature of the flipped mode as discussed below , we get @xmath116db of squeezing in the tem@xmath0 mode , which is exactly what can be measured experimentally by using the homodyne detection with a tem@xmath0 local oscillator .",

    "right hand side of the figures shows the corresponding locked local oscillator phase to the ( a ) displacement or ( b ) tilt measurement .",
    "sqz : at @xmath126 the squeezed noise level is 2  db below the shot noise and at @xmath127 there is 8  db of anti - squeezing noise .",
    "disp : mod - sqz curve locked to @xmath126 for displacement measurement .",
    "tl : mod - sqz curve locked to @xmath127 for tilt measurement .",
    "displacement measurement is improved by the 2  db of squeezing , while the tilt measurement is degraded by the 8  db of anti - squeezing.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    we have in this section demonstrated measurements of a pair of quantum conjugate variables - displacement and tilt - with a homodyne detector involving a tem@xmath0 mode local oscillator , and performed sub shot noise displacement measurements .",
    "we can compare the results obtained with the split detection and the homodyne detection by using eq .",
    "[ efficiency ] , where we need to take into account the input beam power discrepancy between both experiments .",
    "it was necessary to take data with more power in the modulated beam for the split detection in order to have a sufficient noise clearance between the electronic noise and the shot noise .",
    "as for the homodyne detection , the local oscillator can be intense , and the noise clearance above the electronic noise can reach around 10  db . this is interesting when the signal to be retrieved is very small , but can on the other hand also be a limitation for large signals .",
    "the experimental efficiency ratio can be evaluated with the following expression @xmath139=0.64 , % = \\frac{p_{inputhd}}{p_{inputsd}}\\left[\\frac{10^{\\frac{mod_{sddb}}{10}}-1}{10^{\\frac{mod_{hddb}}{10}}-1}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath140w and @xmath141mw refer to the signal beam powers , in the case of the homodyne and split detection , respectively . @xmath142 and @xmath143 are the maximum detected modulation in each detection scheme , relative to the shot noise . the two experimental curves read @xmath144  db and @xmath145  db , which yields @xmath146 , and which precisely correspond to the theoretical expectation .",
    "the uncertainty , mainly given by the one on the maximum modulation values , can be evaluated to @xmath147 .",
    "we therefore report an efficiency improvement of @xmath110 in perfect agreement with the theoretical value calculated in reference @xcite .",
    "although the split detection is easier to set - up experimentally , the homodyne scheme is more efficient and allows measurements of both the displacement and tilt of the beam without moving the detector position , giving a complete information on the interaction between the sample and the beam .",
    "we show that one can choose which measurement to improve ( tilt or displacement ) using squeezed light by simply varying the phase of the squeezed beam .",
    "there are additional limitations to the use of a split detector due to its gap and to its finite size , which are imposing constraints when the variation of the modulation on the propagation axis is measured .",
    "the accessible range to a good detection on the @xmath56 axis is small , as the beam can neither be too small ( because of the gap ) , nor too large ( because of the finite size of the detector ) .",
    "moreover , in order to perform measurements beyond the qnl , one has to carefully image the squeezed flipped mode onto the sample , and also onto the detector , as the flipped mode is not stable in propagation .",
    "this imaging difficulty is not present in the homodyne case .",
    "nevertheless , it is replaced with the constraint of a careful mode matching of the incoming beams .",
    "moreover , homodyne detection can not be used for the positioning of an incoherent light beam , as it is relying on the interferences between incoming beam and local oscillator .",
    "we have demonstrated a homodyne detection scheme involving a tem@xmath0mode local oscillator in order to measure the displacement and tilt of a gaussian beam .",
    "we report a detection efficiency improvement of @xmath110 relative to the split detection , in perfect agreement with the theoretical value .",
    "our detection setup is very simple and could thus easily replace split and quadrant detectors in many applications , particularly when tilt and displacement are needed at the same time .",
    "moreover , further developments using non classical are possible , as we have presented measurements beyond the qnl with these devices .",
    "note that we are now able to generate the squeezed tem@xmath0 mode directly , without the use of a wave - plate , with a misaligned optical parametric amplifier @xcite , allowing a simplification of the setup .",
    "quantum measurements in the transverse plane such as the ones presented in this paper potentially open the way to parallel quantum information processing .",
    "indeed , instead of using amplitude and phase quadratures or stokes operators , conjugated quantum operators are now available in the transverse plane .",
    "the generation of spatial - entanglement between position and momentum of two laser beams will be considered as a first step towards this goal .",
    "note that spatial entanglement has already been demonstrated with orbital angular momentum in the single photon regime @xcite .",
    "other types of experiments that could follow are dense coding and teleportation of spatial information and spatial holography .",
