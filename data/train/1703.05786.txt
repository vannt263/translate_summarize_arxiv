    "@xcite achieves sizable effects in @xmath31  @xcite together with a simultaneous efficient suppression of the supersymmetric qcd contributions to @xmath44 @xcite .",

    "it can be seen that if @xmath119 is close @xmath125 , the constraint from @xmath44 is weakened while @xmath126 as well as @xmath127 is enhanced .    next , let us investigate upper and lower limits on @xmath128 and @xmath129 . in the following analysis",
    ", we fix the slepton mass close to the experimental limit ( @xmath130 )  @xcite and use gut relations among all three gaugino masses .",
    "therefore , when one fixes the lightest squark mass , the relevant free parameters are only |_q,12| ,  ,  m_3 ,  m_|u / m_|d , with @xmath131 , the blue solid line encloses the maximally allowed region in the @xmath127@xmath132 plane ( normalized by their sm values ) .",
    "the maximal values are obtained whenever the susy contributions to the @xmath133 amplitude exactly cancel .",
    "the contour lines in the figures show the required value of @xmath134 ( imposing again gut relations ) for this cancellation .",
    "the maximal and minimal values for @xmath135 are obtained by the decoupling one of the left - handed mixed down - strange squark while simultaneously maximizing their mixing .",
    "since we assume equal diagonal entries of the bilinear terms this corresponds to the limit @xmath136 and @xmath137 which implies one light squark which is an equal admixture of the first and second generation of interaction eigenstates .",
    "note that these results are independent of @xmath138 , but @xmath138 is important when considering the correlation with @xmath139 . in the left and right panels ,",
    "the lightest squark mass is fixed to 1.5  and 3 , respectively .",
    "the latest searches for first - generation squarks at the lhc imply @xmath140 if the gluino is heavy and the neutralino is light @xcite .",
    "we find that the upper allowed values for the branching ratios differ significantly from the sm predictions . however , in order to achieve these maximal values , severe tuning of the gluino mass ( with respect to the squark masses ) and of the cp violating phase is necessary : e.g. around @xmath141 , @xmath91 is much suppressed while @xmath128 is enhanced .",
    "let us now investigate the degree of tuning of the gluino mass needed to suppress @xmath142 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:15tevtuning ] , the necessary amount of the tuning in the gluino mass with respect to the value for the exact cancellation is shown , again in the @xmath127@xmath132 plane like fig .  [",
    "fig : m3mscontour ] . in the light ( dark ) blue regions",
    "the amount of tuning is milder than 1% ( 10% ) , respectively while in the regions outside more sever tuning is required in order to satisfy constraints from @xmath44 ( using the inclusive @xmath111 @xcite ) and @xmath143 at the @xmath110 level .",
    "this means that the gluino mass can be shifted from its value necessary for an exact cancellation in @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( given by the contours in fig .",
    "[ fig : m3mscontour ] ) by 1% ( @xmath144 ) and 10% ( @xmath145 ) and the cp violating phase can differ from @xmath146 by @xmath147 and @xmath148 whithout violating the constraints .",
    "the red contour show the susy contributions to @xmath149 and the current @xmath0 discrepancy is resolved at @xmath109(@xmath110 ) within the dark ( light ) green region .",
    "the black dashed lines indicate the shifts of the boundaries of the green regions when the gluino is taken to be @xmath150 heavier than in fig .  [ fig : m3mscontour ] .",
    "the lightest squark mass is fixed to 1.5 . in the left ( right )",
    "panel we used @xmath151 ( 2 ) with @xmath152 for @xmath153 , and @xmath154 ( 2 ) with @xmath155 for @xmath156 .",
    "the same results are depicted in fig .  [ fig:3tevtuning ] but for a lightest squark mass of 3 , and @xmath157 ( 2 ) with @xmath152",
    "is used for @xmath158 , or @xmath159 ( 2 ) with @xmath160 , in the left ( right ) panel .",
    "comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : m3mscontour ] to fig .",
    "[ fig:3tevtuning ] we can see that if @xmath161 ( or @xmath162 ) differs more strongly from 1 , @xmath163 is predicted to be smaller in light of the @xmath149 discrepancy .",
    "[ fig:3tevtuning ] also illustrates an important finding : there is a strict correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath138 : @xmath164 .",
    "this finding is easily understood by recalling that @xmath165 determines whether we must choose the cp phase @xmath119 between 0 and @xmath166 or instead between @xmath166 and @xmath167 to generate the desired positive contribution to @xmath13 .",
    "now the sign of the mssm contribution to @xmath168 depends on the cp phase in the same way , but there is no explicit dependence of @xmath168 on @xmath169 .    numerically , we observed @xmath170 and @xmath171 in light of @xmath149 discrepancy , if all squark are heavier than @xmath11 and if a @xmath12 fine - tuning is permitted .",
    "similarly , @xmath172 and @xmath173 are predicted , if all squark masses are above @xmath174 with a @xmath150 fine - tuning .",
    "note that if @xmath175 is close to @xmath176 , the trojan penguin contribution from the susy qcd box diagrams are suppressed and the gluino contribution to the chromomagnetic operator entering @xmath149 becomes dominant : for @xmath175 = 1.05 ( 1.02 ) , 25 % ( 50% ) of the susy contribution comes from the chromomagnetic operator for @xmath177 and larger values of @xmath178 are predicted .",
    "however , it is shown that such a case always requires fine - tuning at the @xmath179 level .",
    "in this article we have studied the correlations between @xmath44 , @xmath13 , @xmath2 and @xmath180 in detail within the mssm . in order to accommodate the @xmath0 anomaly",
    ", we generate isospin violation by a mass splitting between right - handed up and down - squark and flavor as well as cp violating by off - diagonal elements in the left - handed bilinear squark mass terms .",
    "we find strong correlations between these observables depending ( to a very good approximation ) only on @xmath181 .",
    "in particular , we find the following prediction : @xmath182 .",
    "this is in contrast to generic @xmath29 models where couplings to leptons are in general free parameters , decoupling @xmath0 from @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we show that @xmath183 is expected to be shifted with respect to the sm value by 510% within the typical parameter region of our scenario .",
    "even a larger shift is possible if one allows for fine tuning : @xmath184 and @xmath10 for a fine - tuning at the @xmath12 level .",
    "it is also clearly shown that our scenario can be distinguished from those with dominant @xmath8-penguins . in the latter scenarios , the @xmath8-penguin contributions to @xmath126",
    "is proportional to @xmath185 and @xmath186 is proportional to @xmath187 .",
    "therefore , a suppression of the branching ratio of @xmath188 ( numerically @xmath189 @xcite ) is in general predicted if there is no cancellation between @xmath190 and @xmath191 @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath192 denotes the effective coupling of @xmath193 originating from np interactions .",
    "this means that an accurate measurement of @xmath2 would be able to distinguish these scenarios .    for our analysis",
    "we assume gut relations among the gauginos . relaxing this assumptions",
    "allows for larger , but less correlated , effects in @xmath194 and @xmath3 .",

    "<S> the rare decays @xmath2 and @xmath3 are similarly sensitive to very high mass scales and the first one also measures cp violation . in this article </S>",

    "<S> we find @xmath9 and @xmath10 , if all squark masses are above @xmath11 , gaugino masses obey gut relations , and if one allows for a fine - tuning at the @xmath12 level for the gluino mass and the relevant cp violating phase in the squark mass matrix . </S>",
