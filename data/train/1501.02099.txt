    "the existence of chiral molecules , that is molecules that rotate the polarization of light , has so far no universally accepted explanation .",
    "hund was the first to point out in 1927 that such molecules according to quantum mechanics should not exist as the corresponding hamiltonian is invariant under mirror reflection @xcite .",
    "this problem became known as hund s paradox and was discussed in the physico - chemical literature for decades .",
    "a possible solution of the paradox can be founded on the idea of spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) once we take into account that the experiments deal with a large number of molecules and that their interactions are sufficient to keep them in the chiral state .",
    "this idea was behind work done previously @xcite where the explanation of the existence was based on a localization phenomenon .",
    "pyramidal molecules , i.e. , molecules of the kind @xmath0 such as ammonia @xmath1 , phosphine @xmath2 , arsine @xmath3 , are potentially chiral .",
    "suppose that we replace two of the hydrogens with different atoms such as deuterium and tritium : we obtain a molecule of the form @xmath4 .",
    "this is called an enantiomer , that is a molecule whose mirror image can not be superimposed to the original one .",
    "these molecules are optically active in states where the atom x is localized on one side of the @xmath5 plane . in the following",
    "we shall refer to potentially chiral molecules such as ammonia as pre - chiral molecules .",
    "another example of pre - chiral molecule , not pyramidal , is deuterated disulfane @xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "[ nh3d2s2 ] ) .    according to quantum mechanics chiral molecules should not exist as stable stationary states .",
    "consider a pyramidal molecule @xmath0 .",
    "the two possible positions of the @xmath7 atom with respect to the plane of the @xmath8 atoms are separated by a potential barrier and can be connected via tunneling .",
    "this gives rise to stationary wave functions delocalized over the two minima of the potential and of definite parity .",
    "in particular , the ground state is expected to be even under parity .",
    "tunneling induces a doublet structure of the energy levels .    on the other hand ,",
    "the existence of chiral molecules can be interpreted as a phase transition .",
    "in fact , isolated molecules do not exist in nature and the effect of the environing molecules must be taken into account .",
    "this interpretation underlies a simple mean - field model that we have developed @xcite to describe the transition of a gas of @xmath1 molecules from a nonpolar phase to a polar one through a localization phenomenon which gives rise to the appearance of an electric dipole moment .",
    "even if ammonia molecules are only pre - chiral , the mechanism , as emphasized in @xcite , provides the key to understand the origin of chirality .",
    "a quantitative discussion of the collective effects induced by coupling a molecule to the environment constituted by the other molecules of the gas was made in @xcite . in this work",
    "it was shown that , due to the instability of tunneling under weak perturbations , the order of magnitude of the molecular dipole - dipole interaction may account for localized ground states .",
    "this suggested that a transition to localized states should happen when the interaction among the molecules is increased .",
    "evidence for such a transition was provided by measurements of the dependence of the doublet frequency under increasing pressure : the frequency vanishes for a critical pressure @xmath9 different for @xmath1 and @xmath10 .",
    "the measurements were taken at the end of the 1940s and beginning of the 1950s @xcite but no quantitative theoretical explanation was given for 50 years .",
    "our model @xcite gives a satisfactory account of the empirical results .",
    "a remarkable feature of the model is that there are no free parameters .",
    "in particular , it describes quantitatively the shift to zero - frequency of the inversion line of @xmath1 and @xmath10 on increasing the pressure .    in this paper , we extend our model to gas mixtures .",
