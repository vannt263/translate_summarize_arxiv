    "the lattice qcd simulation has become a powerful method to investigate hadron properties directly based on qcd .",
    "the spectroscopy of lowest - lying hadrons in the quenched approximation , i.e. , without dynamical quark - loop effects , has been almost established , and reproduces their experimental values within 10 % deviations @xcite .",
    "extensive simulations including dynamical quarks are in progress and would give us detailed understanding of the spectra of these ground - state hadrons @xcite .",
    "in contrast , several lattice studies on the excited - state hadrons have been started @xcite very recently , and their calculations are far from established even at the quenched level . in this paper , using anisotropic lattice",
    "qcd , we investigate the low - lying negative - parity baryon spectra , particularly paying attention to the flavor - singlet baryon .",
    "another purpose of this paper is to examine the correspondence between the flavor - singlet three - quark ( 3q ) state and the @xmath5 .    in the context of the flavor - singlet baryon",
    ", the @xmath5 is known to be one of the most mysterious hadrons .",
    "the @xmath5 is the lightest negative - parity baryon , although it contains strangeness .",
    "moreover , there are two physical interpretations on the @xmath5 . from the viewpoint of the quark model , the @xmath5",
    "is described as the flavor - singlet 3q system . as another interpretation",
    ", the @xmath5 is an interesting candidate of the hadronic molecule such as the @xmath8 bound state with a large binding energy of about 30 mev .",
    "we aim to clarify whether the @xmath5 can be explained as a flavor - singlet baryon in quenched lattice qcd .",
    "historically , excited - state baryons have been so far mainly investigated within the framework of the non - relativistic quark model , in which baryons can be classified in terms of the spin - flavor @xmath9 symmetry . while the ground - state baryons have completely symmetric spin - flavor wave functions and form the 56-dimensional representation , the low - lying negative - parity baryons are parts of the @xmath10 orbitally excited states and belong to the @xmath9 70-dimensional representation .",
    "we summarize the classification of the @xmath9 symmetry and its assignment to experimentally observed baryons in table [ tab : su6baryons ] .",
    "both the non - relativistic @xcite and the semi - relativistic @xcite quark models reproduce the negative - parity baryon spectra fairly well in the octet and the decuplet sectors @xcite .",
    "such success of the quark model implies that the constituent quark picture holds well and the gluonic excitation modes play a less important role .",
    "the potential form is being clarified with the recent lattice qcd calculations of the static 3q potential @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the large gluonic excitation energy @xcite obtained with lattice qcd explains the reason why the quark potential model without such gluonic excitations well describes the hadron spectra .    among the low - lying negative - parity baryons ,",
    "the @xmath5 is an exception of such success of the quark potential model .",
    "in fact , the @xmath5 is much lighter than the lowest - lying non - strange negative - parity baryons , @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "there are two physical interpretations proposed for the @xmath5 : an @xmath4 flavor - singlet 3q state , and an @xmath15 bound state , i.e. , a penta - quark ( 5q ) system .",
    "the simple quark model is based on the former picture , and it predicts that the @xmath5 and the @xmath16 with @xmath12 are nearly degenerate @xcite . in this picture , the large mass difference between them is explained to originate from a large @xmath17-force @xcite , but such a strong @xmath17 splitting is not observed in other baryon spectra , and therefore it seems difficult to reproduce the mass of the @xmath5 within the simple quark model .    another interesting interpretation for the @xmath5 is the penta - quark ( 5q ) system or the @xmath15 bound state as a hadronic molecule  @xcite .",
    "note here that the @xmath5 lies about 30 mev below the @xmath15 threshold , and this binding energy of about 30 mev is rather large in comparison with about 2.2 mev , that of the deuteron .",
    "if this picture holds true , the large binding energy between @xmath18 and @xmath19 results in a significant role of the attractive effect for the @xmath19 put inside nuclei or nuclear matter . in this way , the study of such an exotic and strange baryon , the @xmath5 , is important also for understanding of the manifestation of strangeness in the hyper - nuclei and the neutron stars .",
    "the 3q and the 5q states , however , would mix in the real world .",
    "therefore , a more realistic question would be as follows . which is the dominant component of the @xmath5 , the 3q state or the 5q state ?",
    "we try to answer this question using lattice qcd simulations . in lattice",
    "qcd simulations , even if one chooses the operator as the 3q or the 5q state , it generally overlaps with both the states through the quark and anti - quark pair creation . in the quenched simulation , however , owing to the absence of dynamical quark - loop effects , such a mixing between 3q and 5q states",
    "are rather suppressed , which would enable us to investigate the properties of genuine 3q and 5q states in a separate manner .    in this paper , we focus on the 3q state and investigate whether this picture can explain the mass of the @xmath5 . apparent discrepancy with the experimentally observed mass",
    "implies that the penta - quark state gives significant contribution to the physical @xmath5 state . in practice , lattice qcd results suffer from various systematic errors .",
    "it is therefore essential to compare the mass of the flavor - singlet 3q state with other negative - parity baryon masses as well as with lowest - lying baryon masses .",
    "it is also important to understand the gross structure of low - lying negative - parity baryon spectrum in relation to spontaneous chiral - symmetry breaking in qcd . if the chiral symmetry is restored , such as at high temperature and/or density , the masses of a baryon and its parity partner should be degenerate .",
    "spontaneous chiral - symmetry breaking causes mass splitting between positive- and negative- parity baryons .",
    "it is important to study nonperturbatively negative - parity baryons in terms of the parity partners of the positive - parity ones",
    ".    since the negative - parity baryons have relatively large masses , their correlators rapidly decrease in the euclidean temporal direction . as a technical improvement",
    ", we adopt an anisotropic lattice where the temporal lattice spacing @xmath3 is finer than the spatial one , @xmath2 @xcite . with the high resolution in the temporal direction",
    ", we can follow the change of the correlator in detail and specify the relevant region for extraction of the mass .",
    "thus efficient measurements would be possible .",
    "this approach is efficient also for other correlators of heavy particles , such as the glueballs  @xcite .",
    "( the anisotropic lattice is extremely powerful for the study of the finite temperature qcd  @xcite , where the temporal distance is severely limited in the imaginary - time formalism . )    in this study , we adopt the standard wilson plaquette gauge action and @xmath0 improved wilson quark action , for which the sizes of errors are rather well evaluated @xcite .",
    "the simulations are performed on the quenched anisotropic lattices with renormalized anisotropy @xmath1 at three lattice spacings in the range of @xmath2012 gev .",
    "for these lattices , the quark parameters were tuned and the light hadron spectrum was calculated in order to estimate the effects of uncertainties due to anisotropy on the spectrum  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : aniso_lattice ] , we summarize the anisotropic lattice actions used in this study . we show the numerical results on the negative - parity baryon in section  [ sec : simulation ] , and discuss their physical consequences in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the last section is dedicated to the conclusion and perspective for further studies .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : spectrum_phys4 ]    finally , we comment on recent lattice studies on the negative - parity baryons .",
    "et al_. investigated the negative - parity non - strange baryon @xmath21 , the parity partner of the nucleon @xmath22 , with the domain wall fermion  @xcite .",
    "their lattice is @xmath23 at @xmath24 ( @xmath25 gev ) and the result is @xmath26 , which is consistent with ours .",
    "et al_. studied the negative - parity non - strange baryon @xmath22 using the @xmath0 improved wilson quark on the isotropic lattices with the size of @xmath27 and @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "they obtained the similar result , @xmath29 .",
    "el al_. also studied the negative - parity baryons using the @xmath0 improved wilson quark on the isotropic lattice , @xmath30 fm )  @xcite .",
    "since they did not carry out the chiral extrapolation , we do not compare the results quantitatively , but the qualitative behavior is similar to us .",
    "they also investigated the flavor - singlet baryons . instead of the flavor - singlet interpolating field",
    ", they used the `` common '' interpolating field which is the common part of the interpolating fields for the octet @xmath31 hyperon and the singlet baryon .",
    "the result is much heavier than the experimental value of the @xmath5 even for such an field .",
    "et al_. investigated the excited state baryons with the overlap fermion with the lattice @xmath32",
    "they employed the constrained curve fitting method for the mass fitting and obtained the baryon masses lower than those from the conventional fitting method .",
    "thus , their results seem to be lower than ours and the other s , while they did not carry out the chiral extrapolation .",
    "dynamical quark simulation of excited - state baryons is also in progress  @xcite . as for the negative - parity nucleon ,",
    "their present result is consistent with the quenched result within statistical errors .",
    "we have studied the mass spectra of the negative - parity baryons and the flavor - singlet baryons in quenched anisotropic lattice qcd . we have used three lattices of almost the same physical spatial volume of about @xmath33 with the spatial cutoffs @xmath342 gev and the renormalized anisotropy @xmath35 .",
    "we have adopted the standard wilson plaquette gauge action and the @xmath0 improved wilson quark action at the tadpole - improved tree - level  @xcite .",
    "the positive- and negative - parity baryon masses are extracted with the parity projection from the same baryon correlators based on the three valence quark picture .    for the flavor octet and decuplet negative - parity baryons ,",
    "the calculated masses are close to the experimental values of corresponding lowest - lying negative - parity baryons . for several negative - parity baryons ,",
    "our lattice data have suggested some predictions .",
    "for instance , @xmath36 can be regarded as the parity partner of @xmath37 , and the @xmath38 would be the parity partner of the @xmath39 baryon , although the spin - parity of the @xmath38 is not yet confirmed experimentally .    as for the flavor - singlet negative - parity baryon , such a three - quark state has been found to lie around 1.7gev , and has been much heavier than the @xmath5 . even considering the systematic errors ,",
    "this difference of about 300 mev seems too large .",
    "if the @xmath5 is described as a three valence - quark state , its mass would be reproduced in the present simulation .",
    "in fact , the present lattice result which can not reproduce the @xmath5 physically implies that the @xmath5 is not described as the simple three quark picture , i.e. , the overlap of the @xmath5 with the three - quark state is rather small .",
    "this seems to support an interesting picture of the penta - quark state or the @xmath15 molecule for the @xmath5 . for more definite understanding of the @xmath5",
    ", it would be desired to perform lattice qcd simulations in terms of the @xmath15 molecule or the penta - quark state .",
    "such a study is interesting even at the quenched level , where dynamical quark loop effect is absent and then the quark - level constitution of hadrons is clearer . as for the positive - parity flavor - singlet baryon , its calculated result is found to be much heavier than the negative - parity one , as is consistent with the quark models  @xcite and the qcd sum rule analysis  @xcite .",
    "very recently , leps collaboration has experimentally observed the @xmath40 ( or @xmath41 ) baryon with @xmath42  @xcite , which requires at least  five valence quarks \" as @xmath43 and is physically identified as a ",
    "penta - quark system \" .",
    "the comparison between the @xmath40 baryon and the @xmath5 may be useful to investigate the features of the penta - quark system .",
    "it is also interesting to investigate this type of a penta - quark system using lattice qcd simulation .    from aspect of the chiral symmetry",
    ", the parity partner should be degenerate if the symmetry is restored at finite temperature and/or density .",
    "it is interesting to see how the mass difference between the parity partners changes at finite temperature on the lattice .",
    "several works on it are already reported for the screening mass of the nucleon  @xcite and they favor the parity degeneracy at the chiral phase transition .",
    "recently based on the chiral effective theory such as the linear sigma model  @xcite and the chiral perturbation theory  @xcite , two different assignments for the negative - parity baryons have been proposed : under the chiral transformation , the negative - parity baryon transforms in the same way as the positive - parity one in one scheme and in the opposite way in the other .",
    "these two assignments behave differently toward the chiral restoration .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to study them from the quark degrees of freedom such as in lattice qcd at finite temperature .",
