    "while photometry and spectroscopy provide information on spatial distributions , chemical compositions , and dynamics , polarimetry adds a valuable extra data dimension that can be used to determine the geometry of astronomical objects and the properties of interstellar particles @xcite .",
    "polarized light may intrinsically originate from the emission process or it may be induced via interactions with a diffuse medium @xcite . in either case , the preferred orientation of the electromagnetic vector , as well a quantitative measure of that preference , can be determined by placing polarizing elements in the light paths of detectors and deriving the stokes parameters @xcite .    from the ground",
    "some care is needed in determining the stokes parameters as the atmosphere introduces photometric variations with amplitudes similar to those expected from the polarized light .",
    "space based polarimeters are not exposed to these anomalies and can use multiple polarizing filters to gather the required information . however , multichannel polarimeters @xcite , which are yet to be employed on space based polarimeters , do reduce some of the complexities of the data reduction through synchronous recovery of the stokes parameters . in fact , with enough care , ground - based polarimeters can measure fractional polarizations of @xmath2 or less @xcite .",
    "dust frequently enshrouds many interesting astronomical objects and inhibits the transmission of optical wavelengths .",
    "this effect declines as the wavelength of the light increases , thus many studies are carried out in the infrared .",
    "it is therefore of great advantage to be able to carry out polarimetric studies with the near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) on board the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) .",

    "it is therefore essential to probe the polarimetric capabilities of nicmos , especially in low polarization targets , and assess any signatures that may be introduced by the instrument itself .",
    "we present here such an assessment based on the previous efforts of , for example , @xcite and @xcite . by examining the on - line data archive for nicmos",
    "we can directly compare the results from polarimetric standards whose degree and orientation of polarization have been determined during other investigations .",
    "the study is limited to include data obtained with the nic2 ( @xmath3 ) camera as the number of previous nic1 ( @xmath4 ) studies , excluding the calibration data , is low .",
    "in addition , these nic1 programs generally probe polarizations of @xmath5 , i.e. , # 7264 , where high accuracies are not necessarily needed .",

    "during the _ hst _ second servicing mission in 1997 , the faint object spectrograph was replaced by nicmos .",
    "this instrument operates from @xmath6 using three independent cameras .",
    "the setup allows for broad , medium and narrow band imaging , coronographic imaging , broad - band imaging polarimetry , and grism spectroscopy .",
    "nic2 , the camera focused on in this study , is a @xmath7 hgcdte array with a 0075 pixel scale giving a 192@xmath8193 field of view @xcite .",
    "after installation on _ hst _ the dewar was allowed to be brought up to operating temperature .",
    "unfortunately , this temperature was not tested on the ground and the subsequent ice expansion provided enough dewar deformation to allow contact between one of the optical baffles and the vapor cooled shield .",
    "the resulting heat sink not only altered the foci of the three cameras , but also depleted the cryogen by the beginning of 1999 ( two and a half years ahead of schedule ) .",
    "however , a mechanical cryocooler , the nicmos cooling system ( ncs ) , which was successfully installed in march 2002 , has since brought nicmos back to life and restored the infrared capabilities of _ hst_. while the instrument performance is comparable pre- and post - ncs @xcite , it must be noted that nicmos now displays a different set of characteristics .",
    "the reason for these changes are at present unclear , however , for individual observations , these effects can be incorporated as changes in the transmission efficiencies of polarizing elements .",
    "one must also be aware that different quadrants of the array may exhibit different bias levels introduced by resetting the array , plus additional bias offsets that are related to operating temperature and main bus voltage @xcite .",
    "while this `` pedestal effect '' has been reduced by modified flight software , it has not been entirely eliminated and may lead to inconsistent polarization measurements .",
    "more specific details can be obtained from the nicmos instrument handbook @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive search of the nicmos data archive has been performed with the aim of analyzing all observed polarimetric standard stars .",
    "there are also a number of extended sources ( e.g. crl 2688 - the egg nebula ) available for use in a calibration study .",
    "however , the ground truth for such objects is useless as the measured polarizations are dependent on resolution .",
    "they also generally exhibit a high degree of polarization and are often variable .",
    "consequently , such objects will not be conducive to determining the polarimetric accuracies for the low polarization targets ( @xmath9 ) with which we are concerned .",
    "a prerequisite for the standards to be included in the sample is independent polarization measures from well calibrated and characterized polarimeters .",
    "the polarimetric standards found , and associated details , are presented in table  [ tab : sample ] .",
    "in addition to the data in table  [ tab : sample ] there are also pre - ncs data for two unpolarized standards , hd10700 and hd30652 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the program for which these observation were made ( # 7614 ) called for the investigation of circumstellar structures .",
    "the actual stars are therefore hopelessly overexposed for accurate study here .",
    "the data and calibration files were retrieved and passed through the latest versions of the _ calnica _ and _ calnicb _ pipelines where appropriate .",
    "each non - destructive readout of individual observations was examined .",
    "the total counts in each multiaccum frame were inspected as a function of the total exposure time .",
    "deviations of this curve of growth from linear , especially at very early times , were deemed to be evidence for the existence of signal persistence . in the cases where the telescope was offset between exposures ,",
    "the areas of the array exposed to source photons in the previous visit were also examined for persistence .",
    "the individual exposures were also checked for any remaining cosmic rays or hot pixels not flagged by the reduction routine .",
    "the _ apphot _ package in iraf was used in order to perform aperture photometry on each polarized standard .",
    "circular apertures with radii from 0.5 to 50.5 pixels ( in 1 pixel intervals ) were centroided on each standard . the observable point spread function ( psf )",
    "was comfortably included in the outer aperture . in each frame",
    "the sky was sampled ( and removed from the target photometry ) using a disk whose inner annulus was defined by the edge of the observable psf , and whose outer annulus was defined by the edge of the array . in every case the sky aperture was large enough to avoid the irregularities introduced by the small number statistics associated with poisson noise .",
    "the methodologies behind extracting the degree and orientation of polarization have been specifically addressed for nicmos by many authors @xcite .",
    "however , we briefly revisit the linear technique for the case of three non - ideal polarizers here .",
    "the reduced , sky subtracted , instrumental counts ( in @xmath10 space ) through each polarizing element are used to define an observed intensity vector of the form @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "the degree and orientation of polarization ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) are defined by the stokes parameters which also define a vector of the form @xmath14 .",

    "@xmath29    @xmath30    in equation  [ equ : theta ] a 360arctangent function is assumed .",
    "in addition , the orientation of the frame has to be subtracted from @xmath13 in order to retrieve the on sky position angle .",
    "we have coded the above process in idl in order to solve for @xmath12 and @xmath13 given three lists of apertures and photometric data .",
    "this process has also been coded by @xcite into the idl routine _ polarize.pro_. their routine takes the three polarized images and produces two dimensional maps of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , whereas the code used here produces the measured polarization through defined apertures .",
    "the two methods are precisely consistent when tested on flat ( polarized ) data , i.e. , one value of @xmath31 for each polarizer across the entire array .",

    "the coefficient matrix used in this study has been constructed from the parameters in table  [ tab : coeffs ] using the latest revised values of @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the idl routine was extensively tested in order to check its performance against known ( simulated ) polarizations .",
    "the testing also provided examples of how the instrument itself may affect the observed polarization ( e.g. , noise and the psf ) .",
    "we have generated data , mapped onto the nicmos pixel grid , which simulates a star with a gaussian surface brightness profile ( both with and without the effects of poisson noise ) , a point source with a tinytim psf @xcite , and the effects of sub - pixel shifts between the pointing of the three polarizers .",
    "small spatial shifts between polarizing elements are not unexpected and may allow flux gathered in one frame to fall into an inter - pixel gap in another .",
    "the resulting polarization profiles ( which all use the post - ncs transmission coefficients for nic2 ) , i.e. , the polarization as measured through progressively larger apertures , are presented in figure  [ fig : tests ] .",
    "it can be seen that the routine behaves as one would predict .",
    "generally there are variations plus larger errors on the small scale , and constant results for large apertures .",
    "the addition of the tinytim psf is seen to increase the small scale variations and errors .",
    "introducing sub - pixel shifts allows the small scale variations to grow . in",
    "all noiseless cases the profile behavior is stable in apertures larger than 05 .",
    "the best polarization estimates for real data are therefore likely to come from large apertures enclosing most of the flux .    in all cases , to get appropriate estimates for the effects of poisson noise , we have replicated the signal to noise ratios typically seen in the standards ( @xmath34 ) as well as the expected polarizations ( @xmath35 ) .",

    "it is also unclear why such an anomaly is not seen in the pre - ncs dithered data for hd331891 .",
    "however , as suggested in  [ chadcf7 ] , this may be an artifact from the pedestal effect .",
    "there do exist several iraf software packages to remove the pedestal effect ( _ pedsky _ , _ pedsub _ ) , but as the dither allows a check of the nicmos polarization properties in each quadrant , we can check to see if this is the reason for the discrepant results by performing our routine only on the data from a single pointing .",

    "we now demonstrate how such an instrumental polarization may be corrected for .",
    "the fact that polarized standards have been measured to be consistent with previous studies ( cha - dc - f7 , hd283812 ) allows us to be confident that the results for the unpolarized standards are real , and that we may be seeing a residual instrumental polarization .",
    "the low number of observed unpolarized standards and the pedestal effect make it difficult to be confident in the exact nature of the instrumental polarization , but we can nevertheless make an attempt to correct the data for this . as the degree and orientation of polarization are derived in stokes ( @xmath101 ) space this is also where we can perform an instrumental correction .",
    "it is essential that the correction is carried out in the ( @xmath32)-plane for each standard and not in the celestial coordinate system .",
    "the unpolarized standard data from pre- and post - ncs observations are considered separately . while the ( @xmath32 ) quadrants are consistent between the polarized standards , the actual values of @xmath102 and @xmath28",

    "the corrections are therefore averaged ( weighted by the errors in @xmath102 and @xmath28 ) across all observed standards after being normalized by the intensity , rather than being simply carried out in the ( @xmath32)-plane . the results from the correction are presented in table  [ tab : correct ] .",

    ", it is possible there have been no changes in the transmission co - efficients",
    ". ideally we would be able to characterize these effects by observing several polarized standards at the cardinal angles of the polarizers ( this greatly reduces the degrees of freedom in the coefficient matrix ) .",
    "this would also allow us to see if there is an instrumental polarization that is dependent on the orientation and level of polarization in the object as well as the roll angle of _",
    "hst_. for example , it is possible that the sensitivity of the mirrors to polarized light is producing some reflective retardance .",
    "unfortunately , there is , at present , insufficient calibration data available in the archive with which to fully check this possibility .",
    "there does exist data for two polarized objects , cha - dc - f7 and hd283812 , at multiple roll angles ( see table  [ tab : sample ] ) , but this statistically insignificant sample inhibits us from drawing any conclusions about the nature of an observationally dependent instrumental polarization .",
    "while previous polarimetric studies with nicmos have not needed to be concerned with such characteristics due to the high levels of observed polarization @xcite , as the capabilities of nicmos are stretched by more and more ambitious programs so will the need to accurately measure low levels of polarization .",
    "in fact , a number of programs needing these levels of accuracy have already been executed .",
    "for example , # 10160 ( the nuclear scattering geometry of seyfert galaxies ) and # 10410 ( anisotropy and obscuration in the near nuclear regions of powerful radio galaxies ) will both require high accuracies as agn generally display @xmath155 .",
    "in addition , as the james webb space telescope will not be flying with polarimetry optics , nicmos will remain the only instrument capable of performing such high precision imaging polarimetry on faint objects .",
    "the recent polarization calibration for the advanced camera for surveys @xcite presents an example for the nicmos calibration . in order for the aforementioned programs to be successful",
    ", new data on a number of both polarized standards , at various degrees and orientations of polarization , and unpolarized standards should be obtained .",
    "pointings should be gridded across the detector in order to investigate field dependence .",
    "a number of exposures , in each polarizer , at different roll angles should also be employed in order to replicate the ground characterization .",
    "this will allow the derivation of element independent transmission co - efficients ( from point sources ) and will allow tests for higher order calibration effects .",
    "such thorough observations may also shed some light as to the reason for the change in behavior from cycles 7 and 11 .",
    "we have conducted polarimetric analyses on all ( un)polarized standards available in the nicmos data archive for the nic2 camera . the principle aim was to determine the behavior of the instrument at low levels of polarization .",
    "we have thoroughly tested our routine for deriving aperture polarimetry of objects and found it to be robust .",
    "it has also demonstrated that observed small radius variation in the polarimetric curves of growth can be attributed to the effects of sub - pixel mis - alignments between polarizing elements and the point spread function .",
    "we have found no evidence for persistence .",
    "our findings also indicate that there is a measured polarization of @xmath99 in unpolarized targets which may indicate an intrinsic instrumental polarization and the need for further tweaking of the on - orbit transmission co - efficients .",
    "assuming we are detecting an instrumental effect we have corrected data for polarized targets in the ( @xmath32)-plane and found the dispersion around previous ( ground based ) polarization estimates to have been reduced , but not totally removed .",
    "we have also derived averaged values of @xmath21 that null the unpolarized standard hd331891 across all apertures , and found @xmath123 and @xmath124 to be 0.8717 and 0.8341 , respectively , when fixing @xmath156 .",
    "in addition , we have attempted to investigate the possibility of an observationally dependent instrumental polarization , but are inhibited from any conclusions by an insignificant sample .",
    "while such levels of residual intrinsic polarization may not hamper studies of highly polarized targets , these levels will have a detrimental effect on studies attempting to measure @xmath157 .",
    "it is clear that a more comprehensive calibration study of nicmos is critical in order for a number of _ hst _ programs to be carried out successfully . the current post - ncs calibration archive ( one polarized and one unpolarized standard ) is insufficient for this to occur effectively .",
    "an array of polarized and unpolarized standards should be observed , at many roll angles and in all quadrants of the instrument , in order for the low level polarization characteristics of nicmos to be properly and fully investigated , understood and removed .",
