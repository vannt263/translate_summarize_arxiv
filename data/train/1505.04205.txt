    "@xmath0semileptonic decays have applications in both qcd tests and light meson spectroscopy .",
    "most notably , exclusive @xmath0decays to the dominant modes ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) involve no light valence quarks and thus provide an ideal opportunity for comparisons to lattice qcd results  @xcite . additionally ,",
    "since the @xmath0primarily couples to the final state hadron s @xmath11 component , @xmath0decay rates can probe the quark content of @xmath10  @xcite and of the scalar @xmath9  @xcite ( including possible glue components  @xcite ) .",
    "further , inclusive semileptonic width measurements of strange and non - strange @xmath17 mesons have revealed an interesting gap .",
    "the widths for @xmath18 and @xmath0decays should be equal in the operator product expansion ( ope ) , up to su(3 ) symmetry breaking and nonfactorizable components  @xcite ( although phase space considerations may not be trivial  @xcite ) . while the @xmath19 and @xmath20 inclusive widths are consistent with each other , the @xmath0inclusive semileptonic width  @xcite falls some 16% lower , outside the range of experimental error .",
    "as the few lowest lying resonances dominate @xmath20 and possibly @xmath21 semileptonics  @xcite , a higher precision measurement of the analogous modes in @xmath0semileptonics could shed light on this difference .",
    "although @xmath0exclusive semileptonic rates have been previously studied  @xcite , the earlier measurements used relative branching fractions and focused on only or @xmath22 . these measurements are complicated by possible interference between the reference mode , @xmath23 , and other @xmath24 modes .",
    "babar  @xcite has more recently obtained @xmath25 in a relative measurement using a 10 mev mass requirement for @xmath26 and taking @xmath24 as their reference mode .",
    "in addition to its inclusive @xmath0semileptonic measurement  @xcite , cleo - c has determined absolute branching fractions for six @xmath0exclusive semileptonic modes in a partial ( @xmath27 ) data sample  @xcite and performed another analysis for and over a larger sample ( @xmath28 )  @xcite .",
    "our analysis improves upon these results by using a novel technique that increases the efficiency for all semileptonic modes and eliminates a limiting systematic in prior measurments .",
    "we use a data sample with an integrated @xmath1 luminosity of @xmath29 at a 4170 mev center - of - mass energy , collected in the cleo - c detector  @xcite .",
    "the detector provided both charged and neutral particle identification .",
    "charged particles followed a helical path through the detector s drift chamber under the uniform 1.0 tesla magnetic field , allowing particle tracking , momentum determination , and mass identification from the specific ionization ( @xmath30 ) . a ring - imaging cherenkov detector ( rich ) improved charged particle identification for higher momentum tracks , where @xmath30 does not give good separation .",
    "the rich measured the light cone given off by particles passing through a lif radiator , with an opening angle determined by the particle velocity .",
    "cleo s csi electromagnetic calorimeter detected photons , measuring their energy and direction .",
    "the calorimeter also contributed to identifying electrons through @xmath31 , the energy deposited by a charged particle in the calorimeter relative to its momentum .",
    "drift chamber tracks had a momentum resolution of 0.35% at 1 gev , while calorimeter energy measurements had a resolution of about 4% at an energy of 100  and about 2.2% at an energy of 1  .",
    "most @xmath0production in electron - positron collisions at a 4170  center - of - mass energy comes in the form of @xmath33 events with a cross section of 0.92  , while @xmath34 events make up another 0.03  @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the cross section to other charm events totals around 9  , with another 12  for @xmath35 continuum . to cleanly separate candidate @xmath0events from other charm and continuum",
    ", we completely reconstruct , or _ tag _ , one of the @xmath0mesons in the event .",
    "we use 13 different @xmath0decay modes in our tag reconstruction , listed in table  [ tab : tag_counts ] .",
    ".[tab : tag_counts]tag modes and counts .",
    "we list tag modes using their charges in @xmath36 decays for clarity , although the number of tags column contains the sum of results from both @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the listed error is statistical .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > \" , ]",
    "various theoretical predictions have been made for relative or absolute @xmath0semileptonic decay rates  @xcite .",
    "some predictions combine with our measured results to determine meson mixing angles . for instance , if we take @xmath38 and @xmath39 to be purely @xmath40 states , the @xmath0semileptonic decays to @xmath38 and @xmath39 can extract the @xmath10 mixing angle . for the mixing angle defined by @xmath41 with @xmath42 ,",
    "the ratio of semileptonic widths gives  @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 contains the relative phase space and the ratio of integrated form factors .",
    "anisovich , et al .",
    "@xcite have used a monopole quark transition form factor to estimate @xmath45 , which combines with our result to give an @xmath10 mixing angle of @xmath46 .",
    "if the constituent quark transition form factor ratio is instead taken to be unity , @xmath47 and we get @xmath48 .",
    "we can compare these results to the @xmath49 mixing angle given by @xmath50 where the singlet and octet states follow @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the bases relate to each other through @xmath53 , with @xmath54 corresponding to @xmath49 symmetry . in the @xmath49 basis ,",
    "our results become @xmath55 with the monopole form factor and @xmath56 for the flat form factor .",
    "alternately , the assumption of an @xmath39 state consisting of only @xmath40 can be loosened by allowing for a glue component . in this case",
    ", we can use @xmath21 semileptonic decays to cancel the glue component through the ratio  @xcite @xmath57 here , the phase space and form factor ratio @xmath44 is assumed to be the same for @xmath21 and @xmath0 decays . combining our @xmath0results with the @xmath21 data  @xcite gives @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) , where the first error comes from the @xmath21 measurement and the second comes from our measurement .",
    "the @xmath9 mixing angle may also be extracted by comparisons to theoretical calculations .",
    "several such estimates of the @xmath9 decay rate exist  @xcite , which collectively set the branching fraction at @xmath60@xmath61 .",
    "we use a flatt model with a @xmath62 range from @xmath63@xmath64 , an @xmath65 range from @xmath66@xmath67 , and @xmath68 values taken from experiment  @xcite to estimate the fraction of @xmath69 in our @xmath7060  window .",
    "these combine with our measurement to yield an @xmath11 mixing angle of @xmath71 , where the first error comes from the range of predictions , the second error comes from the uncertain @xmath9 mass and width , and the third error comes from our measurement . ignoring the nonphysical range and treating the errors as independent gives a mixing angle of @xmath72 .    additionally , combining our measurement with lattice calculations",
    "determines a @xmath73 value  @xcite .",
    "we use  @xcite @xmath74 where the first error comes from the lattice simulation , and the second error comes from complications due to the strong @xmath75 decay ( not a `` gold - plated '' decay ) .",
    "this yields @xmath76 , with our measurement uncertainty generating the first error and the combination of both lattice uncertainties giving the second error .",
    "the @xmath73 result falls within one standard deviation of the best current value ( @xmath77 )  @xcite .",
    "we have used cleo - c s 4170  data to measure semileptonic decays for the six exclusive modes @xmath78 .",
    "our procedure uses additional data for four modes ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 ) and involves a new technique in which the @xmath13daughter photon does not get reconstructed , significantly increasing the available statistics .",
    "we see @xmath2 ( )  = ( @xmath3)% ; @xmath2 ( )  = ( @xmath4)% ; @xmath2 ( )  = ( @xmath5)% ; @xmath2 ( )  = ( @xmath6)% ; @xmath2 ( )  = ( @xmath7)% ; and @xmath2 ( )  = ( @xmath8)% within 60  of the @xmath9 mass .",
    "our measurements show that these six exclusive modes nearly saturate the inclusive @xmath0width .",
    "we would like to thank m.b .",
    "voloshin for useful discussions on @xmath17 meson semileptonics , particularly inclusive decays .",
    "we thank g.p .",
    "lepage for sharing some of his lattice knowledge wtih us .",
    "this analysis uses cleo - c data ; as members of the retired cleo collaboration , we appreciate the afforded opportunity to revive it one more time .",
