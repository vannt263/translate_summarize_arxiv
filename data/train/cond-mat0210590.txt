    "various mesomorphic structures can be prepared using the strong ( ionic ) or weak ( hydrogen ) bonding , respectively , between homopolymers and head  functionalized oligomers or surfactants @xcite .",
    "the interaction between the head group of the oligomeric molecule and suitable groups on the homopolymer chain , on the one hand , and unfavorable polar  nonpolar interactions between the non  polar tail of the oligomer and the rest of the system , on the other one , can cause the microphase separation .",
    "the latter effect results in a periodic alternation of the layers of stretched homopolymer chains surrounded by perpendicularly oriented oligomeric tails as it is shown in figure 1 .",
    "an example of the ionically bonded system is represented by the homopolymer - oligomer mixture of atactic poly(4-vinyl pyridine ) ( p4vp ) and dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid ( dbsa ) where due to a very strong interaction the microphase separation is realized over the whole temperature region @xcite .",
    "the peculiarity of the systems of this kind is an increasing long space period @xmath0 as a function of the oligomeric fraction @xmath1 defined as the number of the oligomeric ( dbsa ) molecules per one pyridine ring ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "more complicated behavior is inherent in the hydrogen bonded systems where the weak interaction causes an order  disorder transition to homogeneous high  temperature state @xcite .",
    "an example of the system of this kind represents the mixture p4vp(pdp)@xmath2 of the same homopolymer p4vp with the surfactant 3-pentadecyl phenol ( pdp ) . here",
    ", contrary to the ionically bonded systems , the long space period decreases with increasing @xmath1 ( see figure 3 ) .    as it is shown in figure 2 , an intermediate behavior ( non  monotonous @xmath1dependence of the long space period ) was found in the system p4vp-(zn(dbs)@xmath3)@xmath2 where the ionic interaction between zinc dodecyl benzene sulfonate zn(dbs)@xmath3 and p4vp is somewhat weaker than in the p4vp-(dbsa)@xmath2 system@xcite .    principally important for our considerations",
    "is the decreasing character of the temperature dependence of the long period found experimentally for all the systems mentioned above @xcite  @xcite .",
    "however , such a character of the dependence appears in the hydrogen bonded systems only within a finite temperature interval limited by the temperatures of crystallization ( or glass transition @xmath4 ) from below and of the order  disorder transition @xmath5 from above ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "as it is shown in figure 5 , an increase of the oligomeric fraction leads to a non  monotonous dependence of the temperature @xmath5 with a maximum occuring near @xmath6 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explain peculiarities of the microphased separated homopolymer ",
    "oligomer mixtures with both , strong and weak bonding , within a framework of the unified scheme of stochastic systems @xcite .",
    "our consideration is based on the obvious equality for the long period @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the oligomeric chain length and @xmath9 is the thickness of the homopolymer layer being fixed due to sharing of the surfactant molecules by homopolymer chains ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "physically , this share is reduced to the inverse magnitude @xmath10 of the circular frequency of the alternation of the oligomer heads along the homopolymer chain .",
    "then , the long period can be expressed by the following equation @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the flory interaction parameter ( @xmath13 is the degree of polymerization of the homopolymer chains ) , @xmath14 is the number of segments in the oligomer chain , @xmath15 is the segment length .",
    "the frequency @xmath16 will be found from the effective equation of motion which is stochastic in nature and where the segment number @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) plays the role of imagined time @xcite .",
    "the problem under consideration is addressed by the definition of effective law of motion @xmath19 that determines the sequence of the alternation of oligomers along the homopolymer chain by means of the occupation number , @xmath19 , being @xmath20 if the oligomer is attached to the segment @xmath17 , and @xmath21 otherwise . in the limit @xmath22 , the argument @xmath17 may be considered as a continuous one , and the behavior of the system is governed by the action and the dissipative functional @xmath23 with dimensionless lagrangian @xmath24 here dot denotes the derivative with respect to the segment number @xmath17 , @xmath25 is temperature in energy units , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are inverse kinetic coefficient , inhomogeneity and interaction parameters , respectively . the key point in our consideration",
    "consists in that the effective mass @xmath27 in eq.([4 ] ) is a fluctuating parameter with the mean value @xmath29 and the variance @xmath30 ( bar denotes the average , as usually ) .",
    "then , after the averaging of the exponent @xmath31 over gaussian distribution of the bare mass @xmath27 , we obtain renormalized inhomogeneity energy @xmath32 as a result , taking into account the stochastic source @xmath33 , relevant euler equation arrives at non  linear langevin equation @xmath34 where the effective mass @xmath35 , characteristic number of correlating segments @xmath36 and @xmath37correlated noise @xmath38 , respectively , are introduced in accordance with definitions : @xmath39    to linearize the equation of motion ( [ 8 ] ) within the self  consistent approach , it is necessary to replace the fluctuational term @xmath40 of the renormalized mass in eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) by the averaged expression @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the structure factor in the frequency representation ( angle brackets denote average over noise @xmath33 ) .",
    "then , the green function @xmath43 and the structure factor @xmath44 take the forms : @xmath45^{-1 } , \\quad s=\\left[\\tau^2(\\nu)+n_c^{2}\\nu^2\\right]^{-1 } \\label{12}\\ ] ] where renormalized interaction parameter is introduced by * equalities * @xmath46",
    "to obtain physically observable values , at first one has to determine the effective mass @xmath47 given by eqs.([13 ] ) , ( [ 11 ] ) . on the basis of the theory of residues , using the structure factor , eq.([12 ] ) arrives at the expression for renormalization mass parameter @xmath48 inserting here eqs.([9 ] ) , ( [ 13 ] ) , we obtain the effective inhomogeneity parameter @xmath49 where the temperature domain is bounded above by the characteristic temperature @xmath50 according to eq.([15 ] ) the effective mass decreases monotonously with increasing temperature from the bare magnitude @xmath51 at @xmath52 to @xmath53 at @xmath54 .",
    "the divergency condition of the green function ( [ 12 ] ) arrives at the proper frequency of the oligomer alternation @xmath55 with imaginary and real parts @xmath56 insertion of eqs.([9 ] ) , ( [ 15 ] ) gives the temperature dependence of the proper frequency @xmath57 where the bare frequency @xmath58 and another characteristic temperature @xmath59 are introduced as follows : @xmath60 as a result , combination of eqs.([1 ] ) , ( [ 19 ] ) leads to the final result @xmath61 where the characteristic length , @xmath62 , is defined as @xmath63",
    "the behavior of the system is determined by the relation @xmath64 where the minimal magnitude @xmath65 fixes the choice of the theory parameters according to the condition : @xmath66 .",
    "it would seem from eq.([23 ] ) that the decrease of the temperaure @xmath67 with weakening interaction when passing from the ionically bonded system ( such as p4vp-(dbsa)@xmath2 ) to the hydrogen bonded one ( e.g. , p4vp(pdp)@xmath2 ) is caused only by the growth of the fluctuation parameter @xmath68 with respect to the mean magnitude of the inhomogeneity parameter @xmath29 .",
    "it appeares , however , that the main reason for such behavior is a decrease of the mean  geometrical magnitude @xmath69 of the principle coefficients in the generic lagrangian ( [ 4 ] ) .    to clarify this problem ,",
    "assume the three ",
    "parametric @xmath1dependencies for the above parameters @xmath70 with positive constants @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 . in limiting case , @xmath77 relevant to the ionically bonded systems , when @xmath78 , @xmath79 , the temperature @xmath5 is so large that the temperature dependence ( [ 21 ] ) takes the form @xmath80 then , fitting of the experimental data shown in figure 2 according to eq.([26 ] ) arrives at the following results .",
    "the system p4vp-(dbsa)@xmath2 : @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 ;",
    "@xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 ; @xmath87 nm ; @xmath88 nm .",

    "@xmath84 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 ; @xmath87 nm ; @xmath88 nm . respectively , for @xmath94 eq.([23 ] ) gives values @xmath95 at ratios @xmath96 .",
    "a much more complicated situation occurs in hydrogen bonded system p4vp(pdp)@xmath2 , where the reduction of the parameter ( [ 23 ] ) leads to a more narrow temperature domain @xmath97 . as a result , the temperature dependence of the period @xmath98 obtains a more complicated form ( [ 21 ] ) which keeps the decreasing character as shown in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "the dependence @xmath99 at a fixed temperature may be described by the estimation @xmath100 following from eq.([21 ] ) and conditions @xmath101 , @xmath102 .",
    "then , the experimental data shown in figure 3 give the following constrains : @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 . respectively , the comparison of the experimental data shown in figure 4 with the fitting results using eqs.([15 ] ) , ( [ 16 ] ) , ( [ 20 ] ) and ( [ 21 ] ) yields @xmath106 , @xmath107 nm .",
    "finally , figure 5 and eq.([16 ] ) give @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 .    as a result ,",
    "taking @xmath111 at @xmath94 the magnitudes @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 are obtained and they provide the value of @xmath72 smaller than @xmath115 which arrive at the parameter @xmath116 and ratio @xmath117 .",
