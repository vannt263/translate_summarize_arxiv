    "tumor cells sense very small concentration gradients@xcite and act in a collective manner@xcite . here",
    "we review the basic theory of concentration and gradient sensing by cells and cell collectives .",
    "this theory places physical bounds on sensory precision and allows us to quantitatively compare the capabilities of tumor cells to other cell types .",
    "theoretical limits to the precision of concentration sensing were first introduced by berg and purcell almost 40 years ago@xcite .",
    "berg and purcell began by considering an idealized cell that acts as a perfect counting instrument .",
    "their simplest model assumed that the cell is a sphere in which molecules can freely diffuse in and out ( fig .",
    "[ sensing]a ) .",
    "the concentration of these molecules is uniform in space , and the cell derives all its information about the concentration by counting each molecule inside its spherical body .",
    "the expected count is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the mean concentration and @xmath3 is the cell volume .",
    "however , since molecules arrive and leave via diffusion , there will be fluctuations around this expected value .",
    "diffusion is a poisson process , meaning that the variance in this count @xmath4 equals the mean @xmath5 .",
    "therefore the relative error in the cell s concentration estimate is @xmath6 .",
    "the cell can improve upon the relative error in its concentration estimate by time - averaging over multiple measurements .",
    "however , consecutive measurements are only statistically independent if they are separated by a sufficient amount of time such that the molecules inside the cell volume are refreshed .",
    "the amount of time required is characterized by the diffusion time , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the diffusion constant and @xmath9 is the cell diameter . in a time period",
    "@xmath10 the cell makes @xmath11 independent measurements , and the variance is reduced by the factor @xmath12 .",
    "this gives the long - standing lower limit @xmath13 for the cell s relative error in estimating a uniform concentration .",
    "the relative error decreases with @xmath9 and @xmath2 , since the molecule count is larger , and also with @xmath8 and @xmath10 , since more independent measurements can be made .",
    "berg and purcell derived this limit more rigorously@xcite , and the problem has been revisited more recently to account for binding kinetics , spatiotemporal correlations , and spatial confinement @xcite . in all cases a term of the form in eq .",
    "[ eq : singleconc ] emerges as the fundamental limit for three - dimensional diffusion .",
    "do cells reach this limit ?",
    "berg and purcell themselves asked this question in the context of several single - celled organisms , including the _ escheria coli _",
    "bacterium @xcite .",
    "motility of _",
    "e.  coli _ has two distinct phases : the run phase in which a cell swims in a fixed direction , and the tumble phase in which the cell erratically rotates in order to begin a new run in a different direction .",
    "the bacterium biases its motion by continually measuring the chemoattractant concentration , and extending the time of runs for which the change in concentration is positive @xcite .",
    "the change in concentration @xmath14 over a run time @xmath10 depends on the concentration gradient @xmath15 and the bacterium s velocity @xmath16 .",
    "berg and purcell argued that for a change in concentration to be detectable , it must be larger than the measurement uncertainty , @xmath17 . together with eq .",
    "[ eq : singleconc ] , this places a lower limit on the run time , @xmath18^{1/3}$ ] . using typical values @xcite for the sensory threshold of _",
    "e.  coli _ of @xmath19 mm , @xmath20 mm / cm , @xmath21 @xmath22 m , @xmath23",
    "@xmath22 m/s , and @xmath24 @xmath25/s , we find @xmath26 s. actual run times are on the order of @xmath27 s. thus we see that _ e.  coli _ chemotaxis is consistent with this physical bound . although the end goal of concentration sensing in",
    "_ e.  coli _ is chemotaxis by temporally sampling changes in the chemical concentration , we would like to focus the reader s attention on the remarkable fact that the bacterium s concentration sensing machinery operates very near the predicted physical limits .",
    "if _ e.  coli _ were to use any shorter run times , chemotaxis would be physically impossible . consequently , the time period for measuring the chemical concentration , @xmath10 in eq .",
    "[ eq : singleconc ] , would be so short that the bacterium would be unable to make an accurate measurement of the chemical concentration .",
    "cells are not only able to detect chemical concentrations , they are also able to measure spatial concentration gradients .",
    "many cells , including amoeba , epithelial cells , neutrophils , and neurons , sense gradients by comparing concentrations between compartments in different locations of the cell body @xcite .",
    "these compartments are typically receptors or groups of receptors on the cell surface , but in a simple model we may treat these compartments as idealized counting volumes as we did before ( fig .",
    "[ sensing]b ) .",
    "the difference in counts between two such compartments provides the cell with an estimate of the gradient . what is the relative error in this estimate ?",
    "consider two compartments of linear size @xmath28 on either side of a cell with diameter @xmath9 ( fig .  [ sensing]b ) .",
    "if the compartments are aligned with the gradient @xmath29 of a linear concentration profile , then the mean concentrations at each compartment are @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the mean molecule counts in the two compartments are roughly @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and the difference is @xmath34 .",
    "the variance in this difference is @xmath35 , where the first step assumes the two compartments are independent , and the second step uses eq .",
    "[ eq : singleconc ] for the variance in each compartment s measurement . for shallow gradients , where the limits on sensing are generally probed , we have @xmath36 , and therefore we may assume @xmath37 , where @xmath2 is the mean concentration at the center of the cell .",
    "thus @xmath38 , and the relative error in the cell s estimate of the gradient is then @xmath39 where the factor of @xmath40 is neglected in this simple scaling estimate . as in eq .",
    "[ eq : singleconc ] , we see that the relative error decreases with @xmath28 , since the molecule counts in each compartment are larger , and also with @xmath8 and @xmath10 , since more independent measurements can be made .",
    "additionally , the relative error decreases with @xmath41 , since the concentrations measured by the two compartments are more different from each other .",
    "however , we see that unlike in eq .",
    "[ eq : singleconc ] , the relative error increases with the background concentration @xmath2 .",
    "the reason is that the cell is not measuring a concentration , but rather a _ difference _ in concentrations , and it is more difficult to measure a small difference on a larger background than on a smaller background @xcite .",
    "eq .  [ eq : g ] has been derived more rigorously@xcite , and the problem has been extended to describe rings of receptors @xcite or detectors distributed over the surface of a circle @xcite or a sphere @xcite . in all cases a term of the form in eq .",
    "[ eq : g ] emerges as the fundamental limit , with the lengthscale @xmath28 dictated by the particular sensory mechanism and geometry .",
    "it is clear that the optimal mechanism would result in an effective compartment size that is roughly half of the cell volume , in which case @xmath42 .",
    "do cells reach this limit on gradient sensing ? this question has been directly addressed for the amoeba _",
    "dictyostelium discoideum_. experiments@xcite have shown that _ dictyostelium _",
    "cells exhibit biased movement when exposed to gradients of cyclic adenosine monophosphate as small as @xmath43 nm / mm , on top of a background concentration of @xmath44 nm . bias is typically quantified in terms of the chemotactic index ( ci ) , which is the cosine of the angle between the gradient direction and the direction of a cell s actual motion . by relating the error in gradient sensing ( a term of the form in eq .",
    "[ eq : g ] with @xmath45 ) to the error in this angle , endres and wingreen @xcite obtained an expression for the optimal ci , which they then fit to the experimental data with one free parameter , the integration time @xmath10 . the inferred value of @xmath46 s serves as the physical lower bound on the response time required to perform chemotaxis .",
    "actual response times of _ dictyostelium _ cells , as measured by the time from the addition of a chemoattractant to the peak activity of an observable signaling pathway associated with cell motility @xcite , are about @xmath47@xmath48@xmath49 s. taken together , these results imply that _ dictyostelium _ operates remarkably close to the physical limit to sensory precision set by the physics of molecule counting .",
    "the precision of gradient sensing is often reported in terms of percent concentration change across a cell body .",
    "for example , both amoeba @xcite and tumor cells @xcite are sensitive to a roughly @xmath0 change in concentration across the cell body",
    ". however , this method of reporting sensitivity may be misleading .",
    "experiments imply very different sensory thresholds for these cells in terms of absolute molecule numbers , as we will now see .",
    "the key is that it takes two numbers to specify the conditions for gradient sensing : the mean gradient @xmath29 and the mean background concentration @xmath2 .",
    "for the amoeba _ dictyostelium _ , these numbers are @xmath43 nm / mm and @xmath44 nm at the sensory threshold @xcite . given a typical cell size of @xmath50 @xmath22 m",
    ", these values imply a mean percent concentration change of @xmath51 ( table [ sense_table ] ) . however , we may also compute from these values the mean molecule number difference @xmath52 from one side of the cell to the other , within the effective compartments of size @xmath28 .",
    "taking @xmath42 gives the maximal molecule number difference of @xmath53 for _ dictyostelium _ ( table [ sense_table ] ) .",
    "together @xmath54 and @xmath55 specify the sensing conditions as completely as @xmath29 and @xmath2 do .",
    "experiments @xcite have shown that breast cancer tumor cells exhibit a chemotactic response in a gradient @xmath56 nm / mm of the cytokine ccl21 , on top of a background concentration of @xmath57 nm .",
    "given a typical cell size of @xmath58 @xmath22 m , this corresponds to a percent difference of @xmath59 , similar to _ dictyostelium_. yet , this also corresponds to a maximal molecule number difference of @xmath60@xmath61 , which is much higher than that of _ dictyostelium _ ( table [ sense_table ] ) .",
    "even though the sensitivities are similar in terms of percent change , they are very different in terms of absolute molecule number .",
    "lower molecule numbers correspond to higher relative error .",
    "we can see this explicitly by writing eq .",
    "[ eq : g ] in terms of the percent change @xmath62 .",
    "defining @xmath63 and taking @xmath64 , we have @xmath65 . accounting for the fact that tumor cells ( tc ) have roughly twice the diameter as _",
    "dictyostelium _ cells ( dc ) , this expression implies that the sensitivities of the two cell types over the same integration time @xmath10 to chemoattractants with the same diffusion constant @xmath8 satisfy @xmath66 .",
    "we see that because the _ dictyostelium _ experiments were performed at lower background concentration , corresponding to lower absolute molecule numbers , the relative error in gradient sensing is @xmath67 times that of the tumor cells , despite the fact that both cell types are responsive to @xmath0 concentration gradients . therefore , it is important to take note of the background concentration when studying the precision of gradient sensing .",
    "these data imply that _ dictyostelium _ cells can sense noisier gradients than tumor cells . however , _ dictyostelium _",
    "cells have been studied more extensively than tumor cells as exemplars of gradient detection .",
    "it remains an interesting open question what is the minimum gradient that tumor cells can detect , not only in terms of percent concentration change , but also in terms of absolute molecule number differences .",
    "we see that although cancerous cells and _ dictyostelium _ cells are of similar size , their sensory responses to absolute molecule numbers can be very different ( table [ sense_table ] ) .",
    "this difference is also reflected in their migration speeds : carcinoma and epithelial cells migrate @xcite at @xmath68 whereas _ dictyostelium _ can migrate @xcite at speeds of @xmath69 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     although cancer cells may be very sensitive to small drug concentrations , that does not translate to successful treatment . in order to achieve cell death ,",
    "much larger drug concentrations are required . in the same study on lung carcinoma cells ,",
    "cell death was observed for drug concentrations on the order of @xmath49 nm and greater .",
    "more typical drug concentrations required for cell death are on the order of micromolars .",
    "for instance , it has been shown _ in vitro _ that anticancer drug concentrations on the order of @xmath49 @xmath22 m are required to kill at least @xmath70 of tumor cells @xcite .",
    "with a cell length of @xmath71 @xmath22 m , @xmath49 @xmath22 m corresponds to tens of millions of drug molecules in the volume of a cell , four orders of magnitude greater than drug concentrations required to affect cell functionality ( table [ drug_table ] ) . in order to effectively kill a solid tumor ,",
    "very high drug doses are required .",
    "complicating matters is the fact that the tumor and its surrounding microenvironment comprise a complex and heterogeneous system .",
    "although most cells in the human body are naturally within a few cell lengths of a blood vessel , due to high proliferation tumor cells may be upwards of tens of cell lengths away from a vessel @xcite .",
    "this makes it difficult for drugs to reach the tumor .",
    "moreover , the high density of many solid tumors causes gradients of drug concentration to form as a function of tumor radius @xcite .",
    "this results in a reduced drug concentration at the center of the tumor and makes innermost tumor cells the most difficult to kill . a promising way to overcome",
    "this difficulty is through the use of nanoparticle drug delivery systems , which increase both the specificity and penetration of drugs to the tumor .",
    "nanoparticle delivery has been shown @xcite to achieve cell death with concentrations as low as @xmath72 nm . although this concentration is lower than delivery without nanoparticles , it is still two orders of magnitude higher than the minimum concentration that causes physical changes in the cell ( table [ drug_table ] ) .",
    "even with targeted delivery , achieving drug - induced tumor cell death remains a challenging task .",
    "given this challenge , we hope to draw upon the physical insights reviewed herein to devise therapeutic strategies that are alternative or complementary to comprehensive cell death .",
    "specifically , we imagine focusing on the metastatic invasion phase , and targeting the functions of invading tumor cells , including communication and migration , in addition to targeting cells overall viability , to produce better treatment ( fig .",
    "[ overview]c ) .",
    "communication is a particularly promising candidate , since it has recently been shown that cell - to - cell communication makes cancer cells more resistant to therapy and helps sustain tumor growth @xcite .",
    "indeed , the exchange of extracellular vesicles , which is a form of communication observed between tumor cells and stromal cells , has been linked to immune suppression , tumor development , angiogensis , and metastasis @xcite .",
    "this suggests that disrupting cell - to - cell communication could be an effective strategy for stopping tumor progression or curbing metastatic invasion . disrupting communication",
    "may not require concentrations as large as those necessary for cell death , which are difficult to maintain _ in vivo _ across the whole tumor .",
    "for example , as little as @xmath73 nm of the gap - junction - blocking drug endothelin-1 is sufficient to remove collective responses in epithelial cells @xcite .",
    "this concentration is several orders of magnitude smaller than that required for comprehensive cell death , and it is on the order of concentrations that are effective with targeted nanoparticle delivery ( table [ drug_table ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is tempting to suggest that managing metastatic invasion by blocking communication or other cell functions is a more accessible therapeutic strategy than eradicating a tumor outright .    although blocking intercellular communication pathways could curb the invasive potential of metastatic cells it is also important to address the ulterior consequences of this strategy",
    ". gap junction intercellular communication ( gjic ) is an important way for the environment to affect change on cells , maintaining tissue homeostasis and balancing cell growth and death @xcite . in cancerous cells",
    "gjic is reduced , causing unregulated cell growth @xcite .",
    "interestingly , many existing cancer - combatting drugs are small enough to pass through cell gap junctions which permit molecules of sizes up to 1000 dalton , but there is a lack of _ in vivo _ studies concerning the benefits and effects of gap junctions on cancer treatment @xcite . it has been shown _ in vitro _ that gjic can propagate cell - death signals through cancerous cells and that high connexin expression , the proteins that compose gap junctions , corresponds to high anticancer drug sensitivity @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to consider the potential negative consequences of blocking intercellular communication in reducing metastatic invasion . it may be sufficient to administer an anticancer drug and a communication - blocking drug at different times in order to avoid negative side - effects .",
    "although this puts a caveat on our proposal of communication - blocking drugs as a viable option for treating metastatic invasion it is important to recall that gjic is not the only communication pathway available to cancerous cells : extracellular vesicle - meditated signaling pathways are potential alternates which could be targeted in place of gjic @xcite .",
    "in this review , we have taken a quantitative look at metastatic invasion as a sensing - and - migration process , which has allowed us to compare metastatic cells to other cell types in terms of their physical capabilities .",
    "we have seen that tumor cells can sense very shallow chemoattractant gradients , which may help guide metastatic invasion , but it remains unclear whether tumor cells operate near fundamental sensing limits , as bacteria and amoeba do . recognizing that metastatic invasion can be collective , we have reviewed recent results on the physical limits to collective sensing , and we have identified the overarching mechanisms of collective migration .",
    "a key insight that emerges is that collective capabilities rely critically on cell - to - cell communication .",
    "this insight opens up alternative strategies for therapy that target specific cell capabilities such as communication , in addition to strategies that aim for comprehensive cell death .",
    "a detailed presentation of the underlying physical mechanics for cell motility and chemotaxis are outside the scope of this review .",
    "readers interested in these topics are referred to these excellent resources @xcite .",
    "it is also important to note that in deriving the limits to concentration sensing we have assumed that the molecules of interest diffuse normally with fixed , space - independent diffusion coefficients .",
    "however , this may not always be the case in the tumor environment , where molecules can also experience anomalous diffusion @xcite .    moving forward",
    ", it will be important to identify whether the physical theory of sensing reviewed herein can be applied in a predictive manner to tumor cells , and whether gradient sensing plays a dominant role during metastatic invasion .",
    "more generally , it will be necessary to integrate the theory of sensing with models of collective migration to predict quantitatively what groups of migratory cells can and can not do . finally , controlled experiments with metastatic cells are required to validate these predictions , and to assess the viability of alternative therapies that target specific cell functions in order to combat metastatic invasion .",
    "our hope is that the integrated , physics - based perspective presented herein will help generate innovative solutions to the pervasive problem of metastatic disease .",
