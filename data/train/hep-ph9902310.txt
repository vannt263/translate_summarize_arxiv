    "the non - observation of kaluza - klein ( kk ) towers for the standard model ( sm ) particles , for example , requires that the sm particles not propagate in the large extra dimensions .",
    "this requires that they be fixed to a 3@xmath3dimensional wall , with a thickness smaller than @xmath21 .",
    "this may be accomplished using purely field - theoretic techniques @xcite , or by using the d - branes of string theory @xcite .",
    "this remarkable proposal allows for many new interesting phenomena to be discovered at future experiments .",
    "these include dramatic model - independent signals at high - energy colliders from bulk graviton production @xcite , signatures of the spin-2 structure of the kk gravitons @xcite , distortions in the drell - yan energy distribution @xcite , and enhancements in the @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 production cross - sections at linear colliders @xcite , as well as other interesting collider signatures @xcite and implications for gravitational processes at high energies @xcite .",
    "future colliders may also discover kaluza - klein and string excitations of the standard model particles @xcite .",
    "the existence of either _ large _ or tev@xmath1 sized dimensions also opens new territory for model - building . in an important early paper @xcite by antoniadis",
    ", the author advocates the existence of tev@xmath1 sized dimensions to break supersymmetry at low - energies .",
    "other prospects include new ideas for obtaining gauge coupling unification @xcite , suppressing proton decay , and flavor physics@xcite .",
    "existing phenomena already strongly constrain @xmath10 .",
    "these include astrophysical processes ( such as sn1987a in the case @xmath26 ) @xcite , bulk graviton production @xcite , and @xmath27 production at lep2 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "the bulk contributions at the one - loop level to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon ( mmm ) are computed .",
    "these include contributions from bulk gravitons , bulk @xmath7 gauge bosons , and , in a two higgs doublet model , those from bulk right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos .",
    "the correction to the mmm is found to be @xmath28 , and is therefore in a first approximation _ independent of n _ , or , in the case of bulk fermions or vector bosons , independent of the _ dimension of the subspace _ inhabited by the bulk states .",
    "now it may seem strange to compute a one - loop correction to the mmm when a correction from a tev - scale suppressed operator may be present at tree - level .",
    "the important point is that the tree - level operator contains an unknown coefficient , whereas the one - loop corrections are present , calculable and essentially model - independent .",
    "they thus represent a lower value to the full bulk correction to the mmm .    in this paper",
    "it is found that the `` expected '' one - loop correction to the mmm is typically @xmath2 for values of @xmath10 from @xmath29 400 gev to @xmath30 . for comparison , this is the same magnitude as the correction expected in low - energy supersymmetry at large @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the bulk correction to the mmm should be compared to its extremely well - measured value of @xcite @xmath32 the bnl experiment ( e821 ) hopes to lower the error to @xmath33 @xcite , a factor of @xmath34 below the existing sensitivity .",

    "the theoretical error is dominated by the hadronic contributions .",
    "the error in the lowest order hadronic contribution is @xmath36 ppm of @xmath37 , but there is hope that this error can be reduced to @xmath38 ppm @xcite .",
    "another large source of theoretical error is the hadronic `` light - on - light '' scattering correction to @xmath37 .",
    "this error is estimated to be @xmath39 ppm @xcite .",
    "these translate into an expected theoretical error of @xmath40 .",
    "a main result of this paper is the computation of the one - loop correction from bulk gravitons and radions to the mmm .",
    "the corrections from a single kk graviton and kk radion are found to each be miraculously finite .",
    "the full one - loop bulk contribution is gotten by summing over all the kk states , and results in a correction to the mmm which is essentially model - independent and independent of @xmath11 , depending only on the scale of strong gravity .",
    "requiring that the correction is smaller than the present experimental error implies , in the case @xmath41 , for instance , that the lower limit on @xmath10 is competitive with limits gotten from other physical processes .",
    "it is also found that as a general rule the @xmath37 constraint provides a comparable limit to @xmath10 for _ larger _ numbers of extra dimensions .",
    "this is in contrast to astrophysical or terrestrial constraints gotten from the direct production of gravitons , where the effect of a physical process with characteristic energy scale @xmath42 typically decouples as @xmath43 .",
    "as such , the @xmath37 constraint provides complementary information .",
    "bulk rh neutrinos were proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to generate small dirac neutrino masses , and can naturally account for the required mass splitting needed to explain the atmospheric neutrino anomaly .",
    "it is found that the correction to the mmm from the tower of rh neutrinos in a two higgs doublet model is close to the future experimental sensitivity .",
    "it is also found that while the constraint on the @xmath7 gauge coupling is quite impressive , a @xmath7 vector boson can still mediate isotope - dependent forces @xmath44 times stronger than gravity at sub - mm distance scales .",
    "finally , kk excitations of the sm gauge bosons are also probed by the mmm and atomic parity violation measurements .",
    "it is found that the stronger limits on the size of extra `` small '' dimensions are gotten from the atomic parity violation experiments .",
    "the limit is @xmath45 tev @xmath46 tev @xmath47 for kk excitations into 1 ( 2 ) extra dimensions .",

    "@xcite allows one to determine the couplings of the higher dimensional gravitons to some matter stuck on a wall .",
    "the interactions are constrained by local 4-dimensional poincare invariance ( which interestingly enough , arise from the coordinate reparameterisation invariance of the wall embedding ) and the full @xmath49dimensional general coordinate invariance , as well as any local gauge symmetries on the wall .",
    "at lowest order in @xmath50 , all the higher dimensional gravitons interact only through the induced metric on the wall .",
    "since the interaction of the induced metric with on - the - wall matter is fixed by @xmath51d general coordinate invariance , the lowest order couplings of the kk gravitons to the on - the - wall matter are fixed by the ordinary graviton coupling to matter , and are obviously universal .",
    "this is important , since the interactions of matter to the kk gravitons are therefore determined by replacing @xmath52 in the ordinary gravity - matter interactions . with @xmath53 , where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , the gravitons couple to the conserved symmetric stress - energy tensor with normalisation @xmath56    there is one subtlety though . the @xmath51d decomposition of the @xmath57 dimensional graviton results in a kk tower of spin-2 gravitons , @xmath58 vector bosons , and @xmath59 spin-0 bosons .",
    "the vector bosons correspond to fluctuations in @xmath60 . in the linearised theory they couple only to @xmath61 , which vanishes if the wall has no momentum in the extra dimensions .",
    "the zero mode of the vector bosons acquires a mass @xmath62 from the spontaneous breaking of translation invariance in the extra dimensions @xcite .",

    "it acquires a mass @xmath64ev to mev from the dynamics responsible for stabilising the size of the extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "the remaining spin-0 fields do not couple to @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "the end result is that only the tower of kk gravitons and radions couple to the matter on the wall . since @xmath63 is proportional to the fermion masses , it is important to include the radion and its tower of kk states in computing the correction to @xmath66 . a careful computation @xcite determines the normalisation of the coupling of the radion to @xmath63 .",
