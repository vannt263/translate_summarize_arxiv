    "the @xmath1cdm model provides the standard framework to study the formation of cosmic structures , with only residual uncertainties on the values of cosmological parameters .",
    "however , while consensus on the agreement between model and data is reached for observables that probe the large - scale structure of the universe ( e.g. , springel , frenk & white 2006 ) , the situation becomes far less clear when the formation and evolution of galaxies are addressed . in this case",

    "the building of galaxies shows a `` downsizing '' or `` anti - hierarchical '' behaviour : at low redshift the specific star - formation rate is higher for smaller galaxies , while more massive galaxies show higher specific star - formation rates at higher redshift ( see , e.g. , cowie et al .",

    "these exceptionally massive galaxies are the giant ellipticals which typically represent the dominant galaxies of rich galaxy groups and clusters .",
    "furthermore , galaxy clusters are the most massive dm halos at low redshift and are predicted and observed to be still undergoing a phase of significant merger events .",
    "the massive ellipticals that reside at the centres of two merging clusters are predicted to merge after one dynamical friction time , which is of order of 1 gyr .",
    "this leads to two important consequences , namely an evolution of the stellar mass function , which is constrained by data , and mergers between big ellipticals .",
    "these are not associated to starbursts , due to the lack of cold gas supply in the merging galaxies ( `` dry mergers '' ) , and are rather difficult to observe ( van dokkum 2005 , masjedi et al . 2006 ; bell et al . 2006 ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "galaxy clusters are pervaded by a diffuse stellar component ( dsc ) , which only in part can be associated with the extended halo of a dominant cd galaxy .",
    "these stars are usually not accounted for in the census of the stellar mass budged in clusters .",
    "their number and mass can be estimated by observing intra - cluster planetary nebulae ( arnaboldi et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 ; feldmeier et al . 2003 , 2004a ) intracluster novae and supernovae ( gal - yam et al . 2003 ; neill et al 2005 ) , agb stars ( durrell et al . 2002 ) using surface photometry of single clusters ( gonzalez et al .",
    "2000 ; feldmeier et al . 2002 ; feldmeier et al .",
    "2004b ; krick et al .",
    "2006 ) or by measuring the diffuse light in coadded images of many galaxy clusters ( zibetti et al . 2005 ) .",
    "these observations give fractions of total luminosity contributed by the dsc ranging from 10 to 40 per cent in massive clusters . the relatively poorer virgo and",
    "fornax clusters have observed fractions of about 10 per cent ( feldmeier et al . 2003 ; durrell et al . 2003 ; neill et al 2005 ; mihos et al . 2005 ) , thus suggesting an increasing dsc fraction with cluster richness ( see also lin & mohr 2004 ) .",
    "the origin of the dsc in galaxy clusters has been studied with the aid of n - body simulations ( napolitano et al .",
    "2003 ; murante et al .",
    "2004 ; willman et al.2004 ; sommer - larsen et al.2005 ; rudick et al . 2006 ; stanghellini , gonzlez - garca & manchado 2006 ) , reaching the general conclusion that a dsc is naturally expected to arise from the hierarchical assembly of clusters .",
    "in particular , murante et al .",
    "( 2006 ) showed that 60 to 90 per cent of the dsc is generated at @xmath6 , and only a minor part of it is due to tidal stripping , the rest being contributed by relaxation processes during galaxy mergers .    clearly , the possibility that a significant amount of stars are diffused into the dsc during the low ",
    "redshift `` dry assembly '' of the most massive ellipticals has important consequences of the evolution of the high  mass end of the galaxy stellar mass function .",
    "massive galaxies at the centre of clusters contain a significant fraction of the total stellar mass of the cluster , ranging from @xmath7 per cent for poor clusters ( @xmath8 m@xmath5 ) to @xmath9 per cent for rich ones ( @xmath10 m@xmath5 ; see , e.g. , lin & mohr 2004 ) . if at each merger these galaxies lost a fair fraction of their stars to the dsc component , and if this mechanism were responsible for the build - up of most of the dsc , then this process would limit the mass growth of the central galaxy by mergers since @xmath0 .    in this letter",
    "we show , using the results of n - body simulations and the morgana galaxy formation model ( monaco , fontanot & taffoni 2006 ) , that the evolution of massive galaxies driven by mergers is severely constrained by observations , and that this tension is removed if a significant fraction of stars is lost to the dsc at each merger .",
    "once this effect is taken into account we predict a much slower evolution of the high end of the stellar mass function at @xmath11 , while producing an amount of dsc at @xmath12 which is consistent with current observational limits . in this paper",
    "we use a cosmology with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 , @xmath18 ; none of the results depends sensitively on any of these parameters .",
    "murante et al . ( 2004 ; 2006 ) analysed hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters , performed with the gadget-2 code ( springel 2005 ) , which include the processes of star formation and supernova feedback .",
    "they found that the dsc represents a significant fraction of the stellar population in clusters , approximately ranging from 10 to 40 per cent , with an increasing trend with cluster mass ( see the blue points of fig .",
    "[ dsc ] ) , thus in keeping with observational results .",
    "murante et al .",
    "( 2006 ) also shows that the bulk of the dsc is not due to tidal stripping of non - central galaxies , which accounts for no more than 5 - 10 per cent of the total stellar component , but to relaxation processes taking place during the dry mergers leading to the build - up of the central dominant galaxy . as a result , up to @xmath19 per cent of the stellar mass of the merging galaxies becomes unbound to the resulting central galaxy . in terms of the mass of each merging satellite",
    ", this translates in @xmath20 per cent of its mass which is scattered to the dsc , depending on the mass ratio of the merging galaxies .    in this letter",
    "we resort to the novel morgana model of galaxy formation to quantify the effect of including the generation of a dsc at each merger on the evolution of the stellar mass function .",
    "this code has been shown to be able to reproduce the build - up of the massive galaxies ( fontana et al .",
    "2006 ) and the population of agns ( fontanot et al .",
    "for the purpose of the present analysis , morgana has been modified by switching off gas cooling and star formation at @xmath21 . in this way , we minimize the evolution of the stellar mass function , which is then driven only by mergers . furthermore , we implement the generation of the dsc as follows : ( i ) tidal stripping of stars is applied to satellite galaxies ; ( ii ) when the satellite merges with the central galaxy a fraction @xmath22 of its stars are scattered to the dsc .",
    "prescription ( ii ) is at variance with monaco et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , where scattering is allowed only in major mergers .",
    "such a recipe , inspired by the results of murante et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , is deliberately simplified and we use it here to provide a qualitative picture of the effect of including the production of the dsc into our model .    in fig .",
    "[ dsc ] we compare the fraction of dsc , @xmath23 , as a function of cluster mass , found in the simulations analysed by murante et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and predicted by morgana for both @xmath24 and 0.3 .",
    "morgana predictions have been computed for 37 clusters , with mass @xmath25 m@xmath5 , identified in a 150 mpc box where the dm clustering is sampled with 512@xmath26 particles .",
    "this comparison shows that using a fixed value of @xmath22 produces a milder dependence of @xmath23 on the cluster mass , thus confirming that our approach to introduce the effect of the dsc generation is oversimplified .",
    "still , predictions from the semi  analytical model and from the hydrodynamical simulations share several common features .",
    "for instance , tidal stripping is confirmed to bring only @xmath27 per cent of the total stellar mass to the dsc , with @xmath28 required to better account for simulation results .",
    "quite interestingly , we also verified that @xmath29% of the dsc is generated at @xmath30 by both morgana and simulations . based on these results ,",
    "we conclude that the morgana model can be used to test the effect of the dsc generation on the evolution of the high end of the galaxy stellar mass function .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the population of massive galaxies , with @xmath31 m@xmath32 , show a modest but significant degree of evolution since @xmath0 . using the goods - music sample , fontana et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found this evolution to amount to a factor of 2.5 in mass density , a degree of evolution which has been shown to be consistent with the predictions of morgana . on the other hand ,",
    "very massive galaxies with @xmath33 m@xmath5 , show a much lower degree of evolution .",
    "we use here as a convenient quantification of this evolution the logarithmic increase of @xmath34 , the stellar mass at which the stellar mass function reaches the level @xmath35 mpc@xmath36 , from @xmath2 to 0 . a detailed discussion on how to measure this quantity from data is beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "( 2006 ) we infer that the evolution of @xmath34 between @xmath2 and 0 can not be larger than 0.2 dex .",
    "this modest evolution clearly requires that massive galaxies must have had a small net gain in stellar mass during the last 7 gyr .    to test the consistency of this constraint with the expected evolution of massive galaxies",
    ", we use the morgana model as follows .",
    "we follow the evolution of the galaxy population until @xmath2 , assuming the standard choice of parameters used both in monaco et al .",

    "the model is known to overestimates at @xmath2 the number density of smaller objects ( @xmath43 m@xmath5 , fontana et al .",
    "2006 ) , and this is noticeable in the figure . as already mentioned in section 2 , we then compute the evolution of the galaxy population at @xmath21 by switching off all the astrophysical processes , including cooling , star formation , feedback , galactic winds and superwinds , so that galaxies can grow only by mergers .",
    "the solid line in the upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ mfbar_01 ] shows the results of this model for @xmath40 : we obtain @xmath44 , i.e. the mass of the most massive galaxies grows by more than a factor of two , in line with the results by de lucia et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and de lucia & blaizot ( 2006 ) , but at variance with respect to observational results .",
    "this result highlights the presence of a potential paradox in cosmological models of galaxy formation : even under the assumption that mergers only drive the evolution of the galaxy population at @xmath21 , model predictions still provide too strong an evolution of the high end of the stellar mass function .",
    "this conclusion is robust against possible uncertainties in the dynamical friction time - scales , which determine the difference between the timing of dm halo merging and galaxy merging .",
    "we verified that , since these time  scales are much smaller than the hubble time , an uncertainty in their estimate does not significantly influence the final results .    as already discussed in section 2",
    ", the model with @xmath40 also underestimates the fraction of dsc produced in simulations for the most massive clusters ( see fig .",
    "[ dsc ] ) .",
    "the other three panels of fig .",
    "[ mfbar_01 ] show the evolution of the stellar mass function for values of @xmath45=0.3 , 0.5 and 0.8 .",
    "values between 0.3 and 0.5 are sufficient to suppress @xmath46 to below 0.2 dex , and at the same time reproduce the observed fraction of dsc .",
    "the rather extreme value of @xmath47 instead tends to over - produce the dsc .    from these results",
    "we conclude that the observed modest evolution of the high - mass tail of the stellar mass function can be reconciled with model predictions by allowing a significant fraction of the stellar mass to be scattered away from the galaxies and disperse into the dm halo .",
    "this is shown also in fig .",
    "[ space ] , where the results of the models are reported in the @xmath23 - @xmath48 plane as lower limits to the values that would be obtained with a full treatment of baryon physics .",
    "the shaded area shows the region currently allowed by data . as a word of caution",
    ", we remind that a direct comparison between the theoretical and observational estimates of the dsc fraction is quite delicate .",
    "theoretical estimates are affected by numerical effects and by uncertainties in the modeling of complex baryon physics that give rise to galaxies , while observational estimates depend upon a number of hypothesis linking the observables ( e.g. number of intra ",
    "cluster planetary nebulae , ratio of fluxes from the dsc and from galaxies ) to the volume  averaged @xmath23 .",
    "despite all these uncertainties we regards our result as a robust one .",
    "the details of the galaxy formation models are immaterial in this test as long as the model gives a plausible population of massive galaxies at @xmath0 , and describes correctly the merging of galaxies driven by the hierarchical assembly of dm halos . in our calculation the evolution to @xmath42 can only be underestimated , since it is performed by forcing a complete quenching of cooling and star formation .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ mfbar_01 ] , where the population of galaxies with @xmath49 m@xmath32 is underestimated at @xmath42 . as a consequence , the evolution predicted by mergers is an underestimate as well , as it does not include the stars formed since @xmath2 . in this case",
    "the known excess of small galaxies predicted at @xmath2 ( fontana et al .",
    "2006 ) gives a modest bias , which is in the opposite direction with respect of the more important bias obtained by quenching any evolution of the stellar component .",
    "therefore , it does not hamper by any means our conclusions .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that the modest evolution of the high - mass end of the stellar mass function may highlight a problem for current models of galaxy formation in the @xmath1cdm framework .",
    "on the other hand , the presence of a significant dsc in galaxy clusters and the mild evolution of the high end of the galaxy stellar mass function may both point toward a scenario in which a significant fraction of the stellar mass of galaxies becomes unbound at each merging event , thereby suppressing the merger ",
    "driven evolution . solving this problem",
    "requires that a significant fraction , @xmath50% , of the total stellar budget in rich galaxy clusters must be in the form of a diffuse component .",
    "deeper searches of intra  cluster light are necessary to either confirm or dispute this prediction .",
    "future instruments , like the large binocular camera at lbt or jwst , will provide a quantum leap in the census of the diffuse stars in the near future",
