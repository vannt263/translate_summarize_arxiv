    "this master thesis originates from a suggestion set out by my supervisor mattias marklund in springtime 2004 .",
    "although some preparations started in august , the main work begun in late october the same year , and has been carried out within the non - linear physics group at the department of physics , ume university .",
    "i became interested in qed - effects thanks to my participation in a graduate course on qft , which provided me with a basic understanding of photon - photon scattering .",
    "however , the calculations in this work are mainly performed within the framework of classical non - linear electrodynamics , and that is why i initially had to put some efforts in learning about non - linear interactions . thereafter",
    "a time of experimentation with different configurations and models followed , which finally lead to the results presented here .",
    "chapter 1 is an introduction containing a general description of photon - photon scattering and the purpose and method of this work .",
    "there is also a survey of the unit systems and conventions used later on .    in chapter 2 a short overview of qed",
    "is presented , and the lowest order feynman diagram corresponding to photon - photon scattering is pictured .",
    "the effective field theory outlined in chapter 3 allows us to express the qed - effects giving rise to photon - photon interactions in terms of non - linear corrections to maxwell s equations of classical electrodynamics .",
    "chapter 4 covers the theory of non - linear interactions needed for the calculations in this work , including coupling equations and matching conditions .    in chapter 5 non - linear terms",
    "are calculated for two dimensional as well as three dimensional configurations .    in chapter 6 the scattered intensity",
    "is determined for and compared between different models of the interaction .",
    "numerical values are inserted in chapter 7 .",
    "the number of scattered photons for optimal configurations is estimated and discussed , both for the existing vulcan laser at the rutherford appleton laboratory and for the planned xfel at desy .",
    "first of all i would like to thank my supervisor mattias marklund , not only for always being there to kindly answer all sorts of questions , but also for all his encouraging words and constant belief in me .",
    "a lot of thanks also to my examiner gert brodin , whose genuine engagement and interest in discussing any arising problems or possibilities have been of greatest help .",
    "i am very greatful for being given the opportunity to work with two such eminent scientists .",
    "thanks also to michael bradley , for introducing me to quantum field theory and being inspiring in general , and to daniel eriksson for all help with the latex - typesetting .",
    "in classical theory , electromagnetic waves propagating in vacuum can not , due to the linearity of maxwell s vacuum equations , interact with each other , and colliding light will not give rise to any scattering .",
    "however , the theory of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) opens for the possibility of photon - photon scattering via virtual electron - positron pairs in the vacuum .",
    "it is possible to formulate an effective field theory containing only the electromagnetic fields , valid for field strengths below the critical field @xmath1 and wavelengths larger than the compton wavelength @xmath2 , in which the interaction shows up as non - linear corrections to maxwell s equations .",
    "hence this pure qed - effect may instead be treated with classical non - linear electrodynamics .    in order to reach any noticeable effects ,",
    "the fields need to be quite strong , and this is the main reason why photon - photon scattering has not yet been detected experimentally .",
    "recent improvements in laser technology however make the situation look more promising .",
    "the aim of this thesis is to investigate , using parameters for current and future systems , the possibility of direct detection of elastic photon - photon scattering .",
    "since it seems like today s technology is just on the edge to make it work , an important task is to carefully optimize the experiments .",
    "photon - photon scattering is a phenomena significant for qed , and direct detection would be of great scientific value as a confirmation of the theory , comparable to the detection of the casimir effect @xcite .",
    "hence the purpose of this thesis is in first place of fundamental nature .",
    "of course future fields of application may arise from the knowledge of how to experimentally produce and control this scattering .",
    "to simply collide laser beams has not really been a realistic way to detect photon - photon scattering before the recent development of petawatt lasers , but during the last decades a number of other detection schemes , based on imposing boundary conditions , have been proposed .",
    "the correction terms vanish in the limit of parallel propagating free waves , but if instead waves trapped between regions of conducting material are used , there will be a non - zero effect .",
    "one suggestion is detection by wave mixing inside a laser produced vacuum channel in an overdense plasma @xcite .",
    "another uses the idea of non - linear excitations of new modes inside waveguides @xcite . however , there are some problems with this approach related to the properties of the conducting material , and it may be hard to separate the disturbances it gives rise to from the photon - photon scattering effects . in order to rule out any other scattering processes it is also important that the vacuum is almost perfect , which can be technically hard to achieve here .",
    "the ultimate detection scheme would be when there is no disturbing matter at all close to the interaction region , and that is the case investigated in this thesis .",
    "the method of this work is based on the simple idea of colliding laser pulses in vacuum , and trying to get some scattered photons out of it . to increase our chances we will send in three carefully chosen laser pulses satisfying certain matching conditions , such that some scattering is , due to the non - linearities , generated in a fourth direction , i.e.@xmath3 we will deal with four - wave coupling .",
    "this scheme obviously does not suffer from any problems with properties of guiding material .",
    "it also mirrors the common picture of scattering as bouncing particles in a nice way : instead of just exciting a new mode inside some guiding structure , we can really see that the light changes direction .    in order to get as nice result as possible",
    ", we will try to find an optimal configuration of incoming beams , and the resulting number of scattered photons will be calculated for two interesting lasers : the vulcan laser and the xfel at desy .        this work deals with three different unit systems . instead of sticking to a single one",
    ", we will use units appropriate for the situation we are considering .",
    "qed is with advantage formulated in natural units , where the vacuum speed of light and planck s constant simply are put as @xmath4 .",
    "hence this is the unit system chosen for chapter 2 .",
    "maxwell s equations are especially nice to work with in gaussian units , where the electric and magnetic fields are of the same dimensions .",
    "gaussian units are used from chapter 3 up to and including eq.@xmath5(6.12 ) , after which we go over to si - units to make the insertion of numerical values somewhat simpler .",
    "more information about how gaussian and si - units are related , and how they easily may be translated into each other , is for example to be found in jackson @xcite .",
    "some important conventions and notations used in this thesis are lined up below :    * four - vector components are labeled by greek indices , running from @xmath6 to @xmath7 . *",
    "the metric signature is @xmath8 , i.e.@xmath3 the non - vanishing components of the flat spacetime metric tensor @xmath9 are given by @xmath10 , @xmath11 . *",
    "the completely antisymmetric symbol @xmath12 is defined to equal @xmath13 for @xmath14 an even permutation of @xmath15 , @xmath16 for an odd permutation , and @xmath6 otherwise . * when writing scalar products of four - vectors the indices",
    "are sometimes suppressed , e.g. @xmath17 .",
    "the spacetime four - vector @xmath18 is usually only written as @xmath19 . *",
    "the four - gradient @xmath20 may be written like @xmath21 or simply just as @xmath22 . *",
    "the commutator of two operators a and b is denoted by @xmath23\\equiv ab - ba$ ] , while the anticommutator is written as @xmath23_{+}\\!\\equiv ab+ba$ ] .",
    "* complex conjugation is denoted with a star ( @xmath24 ) and hermitian conjugation with a dagger ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "vectors with complex components are equipped with a tilde ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "this chapter is intended to give a short introduction to quantum field theory ( qft ) in general , and quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) in specific .",
    "although the main calculations in this thesis are carried out within the framework of classical non - linear electrodynamics , a brief introduction of the underlying theory will be outlined here .",
    "after all , it is a process predicted by qed which is considered , and for the reader not familiar with this theory a quick overview should be in its place .",
    "however , anyone who wishes to skip this part and directly proceed to chapter 3 , may do so without getting into problems .",
    "it must be pointed out that the treatment given below is anything but complete .",
    "innumerable things have been left out , both details as well as fundamentals .",
    "more profound texts are for instance given by mandl&shaw @xcite and zee @xcite .",
    "note that natural units ( @xmath4 ) are used in this chapter .        at the turn of the 20th century",
    "some remarkable progresses were made in the science of physics . in 1900 ,",
    "planck s explanation of the black - body radiation provided the basic ideas that would finally lead to the formulation of quantum theory . as an attempt to fit theory to experimental data",
    ", he proposed that the process of emission and absorption of radiation by atoms occurs discontinuously in quanta .",
    "einstein went even a step longer when he in order to explain the photoelectric effect , concluded that the electromagnetic field itself consists of quanta , so called photons .",
    "about the same time , in 1905 , einstein also formulated his famous special theory of relativity ( sr ) , forever changing our notions of space and time .",
    "both non - relativistic quantum mechanics ( i.e. @xmath27the quantum theory of classical mechanics ) and special relativity have turned out to be very accurate within their respective domain of validity . but how to describe a particle moving at high speed , where both quantum theory and special relativity seem to be needed ?",
    "the schrdinger equation determining the time evolution in non - relativistic quantum mechanics is not lorentz covariant , and hence needs to be modified in order to be consistent with sr .",
    "several candidates of covariant relativistic wave equations describing different kinds of particles exist , but suffer from difficulties in their single particle interpretation .    by quantizing the fields obeying those equations , and thereby going over from single particles to a many particle theory",
    ", one can get around these problems in a smooth way .",
    "anyway , when dealing with the interaction between radiation and atoms in quantum mechanics , the fourier components of the electromagnetic field are often subjected to a quantization , giving rise to the photons . by symmetry reasons it then seems natural to quantize also all other particles .",
    "the many particle view allows for the creation and annihilation of different particles , something unachievable in the single particle interpretation .",
    "we have here given a very rough overview of the utility of a quantum field theory , but the adequateness of it must of course utterly be determined by experiments .",
    "let us now have a look at how the quantization of fields is performed .",
    "there exist two main approaches to quantum field theory : the canonical formulation and the path integral formulation .",
    "these formalisms often appear to be complementary , and a problem hard to solve using one of them may be a lot simpler in the other , and vice versa .",
    "a characteristic difference between the approaches is the presence of operators in one but not the other .",
    "we will for both formalisms outline the quantization procedure of any classical field theory derivable from an action integral @xmath28 by demanding the variation @xmath29 for any arbitrary spacetime region @xmath30 when variating the fields @xmath31 , @xmath32 , needed to specify the system . that is , the equations of motion of the fields can be derived from the lagrangian density @xmath33 by using the euler - lagrange equations @xmath34    in the canonical formulation of quantum field theory the usual canonical quantization procedure is generalized to work on fields as well . in heisenberg s",
    "approach to non - relativistic quantum mechanics , a system with configuration space variables @xmath35 is quantized by identifying the canonical momenta @xmath36 , and then turning those conjugate coordinates and momenta into heisenberg operators subjected to the commutation relations @xmath37=i\\delta_{jk}\\\\ \\left[q_{j}\\!\\left(t\\right),q_{k}\\!\\left(t\\right)\\right]=\\left[p_{j}\\!\\left(t\\right),p_{k}\\!\\left(t\\right)\\right]=0\\end{array}\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    when dealing with fields , the dynamical quantities corresponding to the @xmath35 are just the field amplitudes @xmath38 at each point in space .",
    "hence the system has a continuously infinite number of degrees of freedom . by going over from the discrete to the continuous system , and by defining the fields",
    "conjugate as @xmath39 , the corresponding commutation relations which have to be imposed on the operator versions of the fields and their conjugate in order to quantize the theory , are seen to be @xmath40=i\\delta_{rs}\\delta\\!\\left(\\textbf{x}-\\textbf{x}'\\right)\\\\ \\left[\\phi_{r}\\!\\left(\\textbf{x},t\\right),\\phi_{s}\\!\\left(\\textbf{x}',t\\right)\\right]=\\left[\\pi_{r}\\!\\left(\\textbf{x},t\\right),\\pi_{s}\\!\\left(\\textbf{x}',t\\right)\\right]=0\\end{array}\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the path integral formulation of quantum field theory is an extension of feynman s approach to quantum mechanics : the amplitude @xmath41 of propagation from a point @xmath42 to a point @xmath43 is equal to the sum of @xmath44 for all possible paths @xmath45 between the points in configuration space . here",
    ", @xmath46 stands for the classical action of the path @xmath45 . by denoting the summation over all paths starting at @xmath42 and ending at @xmath43 by an integral over @xmath47 ,",
    "we may write the amplitude as @xmath48 of course the summation over all paths is not a trivial thing to get a grasp of , but we will not go deeper into any mathematical details in this short review .",
    "the extension to fields is now quite obvious : the amplitude @xmath41 for a system initially in state @xmath49 to finally end up in the state @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 tells us to sum over all possible field configurations smoothly connecting the initial and final states , and @xmath53 is the action corresponding to the configuration @xmath54 of such type .",
    "note that this summation is over a mindboggling set of possibilities , and the only integral that can be solved analytically is the gaussian , corresponding to the free field case .",
    "the path integral formulation is indeed the computationally more interesting nowadays , much thanks to its suitability to treat nonperturbative effects , but some features like the appearance of particle - like properties are easier to see in the canonical formalism . the lorentz invariance is obviously built in from the start in the path integral formalism , while it may be harder to see in the canonical since the imposed commutation relations single out equal times .",
    "we now turn to quantum electrodynamics , the quantum field theory of the electromagnetic and the electron - positron fields and their mutual interaction .",
    "a relativistic wave equation describing spin @xmath55 fermions , including the electron - positron , with mass @xmath56 was found by dirac in 1928 .",
    "this so called dirac equation can in a representation - free way be written @xmath57 where @xmath58 are 4@xmath594 matrices satisfying the anticommutation relations @xmath60_{+}=2\\eta^{\\mu\\nu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as well as the hermicity conditions @xmath61 and where @xmath62 accordingly is a four component spinor wavefunction @xmath63 , @xmath64 , but we choose to suppress all matrix and spinor indices .",
    "the adjoint field @xmath65 then satisfies the adjoint dirac equation @xmath66 and eqs.@xmath5(2.7 ) and ( 2.10 ) may be derived from the lagrangian density @xmath67 by taking @xmath63 and @xmath68 as the independent fields in euler - lagrange equations ( 2.2 ) .    unfortunately",
    ", the quantization procedures outlined above really only works for bosons , and some adjustments have to be made for fermions in order to respect the antisymmetry of the wave function .",
    "the expansion of a canonically quantized bosonic field in a complete set of solutions leads to the identification of annihilation and creation operators satisfying certain commutation relations . for spin @xmath55 fermions we do a similar expansion in a complete set of solutions to the dirac equation , but now instead impose anticommutation relations on the expansion coefficients .",
    "a complete set of plane wave solutions to the dirac equation ( 2.7 ) can be found from consideration of a cubic enclosure of volume @xmath69 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "for each allowed momentum @xmath70 , with corresponding energy @xmath71 , there are four independent solutions : @xmath72 where the constant four component spinors @xmath73 and @xmath74 satisfy @xmath75 and are chosen to be normalized according to @xmath76 the quantized versions of the dirac field and its adjoint field can be written as @xmath77,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath78,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the summations are over all allowed momenta @xmath70 and both spin states ( corresponding to @xmath79 ) , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and the expansion coefficients are subjected to @xmath82_{+}=\\left[d_{r}\\!\\left(\\textbf{p}\\right),d^{\\dagger}_{s}\\!\\left(\\textbf{p}'\\right)\\right]_{+}=\\delta_{rs}\\delta_{pp'}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while all the other combinations anticommute .",
    "it follows from ( 2.17 ) that we can interpret @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , @xmath86 as absorption and creation operators of two different kinds of fermions , and physical properties of these particles may be deduced from the constants of motion derivable from the lagrangian density ( 2.11 ) .",
    "the conclusion is that the @xmath87- and @xmath88-operators corresponds to electrons and positrons respectively .",
    "for example , with the vacuum state @xmath89 defined by @xmath90 for all @xmath70 and @xmath79 , the state @xmath91 consists of one positron with momentum @xmath70 in spin state @xmath92 , while the state @xmath93 also includes an electron with momentum @xmath94 in spin state @xmath95 as well .    in the path",
    "integral formalism , the quantization of fermions can be performed by introducing so called grassmann numbers .",
    "however , that is nothing which will be investigated here , and we choose to be satisfied with the canonical approach",
    ".      expressed in terms of the four - vector potential @xmath96 , maxwell s equations for the free electromagnetic field become ( see section 3.2 for definitions ) @xmath97    the quantization can unfortunately not be performed using the usual lagrangian density ( 3.23 ) due to problems with conjugate fields being identically zero , but another better suited one is given by @xmath98 however , the field equations this lagrangian density gives rise to are only equivalent to eq.@xmath5(2.18 ) in a lorentz gauge , i.e.@xmath3 we have to add the subsidiary condition @xmath99 on identifying the fields conjugate to @xmath96 , carrying out the canonical quantization procedure , and finally expanding the free electromagnetic field in a complete set of solutions to the field equations ( 2.18 ) in a lorentz gauge ( i.e.@xmath3 to @xmath100 ) , one gets the quantized version @xmath101,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with summation over all allowed wave vectors @xmath102 and four polarization states @xmath103 with corresponding polarization vectors @xmath104 , the energy @xmath105 , and expansion coefficients as operators subjected to the commutation relations @xmath106=\\zeta_{r}\\delta_{rs}\\delta_{kk'}\\\\ \\left[a_{r}\\!\\left(\\textbf{k}\\right),a_{s}\\!\\left(\\textbf{k}'\\right)\\right]=\\left[a^{\\dagger}_{r}\\!\\left(\\textbf{k}\\right),a^{\\dagger}_{s}\\!\\left(\\textbf{k}'\\right)\\right]=0\\end{array}\\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "we are thus lead to the interpretation of @xmath109 and @xmath110 as absorption and creation operators respectively for both transverse photons ( @xmath111 ) and longitudinal photons ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "the minus sign present for scalar photons ( @xmath113 ) brings about some problems , but can be handled by imposing the lorentz gauge ( 2.20 ) ( or really an equivalent condition ) .",
    "this will lead to the conclusion that only transverse photons may be real , and hence the number of independent polarizations is reduced to two , something familiar from classical electrodynamics .",
    "after this compressed presentation of the quantized free electron - positron and electromagnetic fields , we turn to their mutual interaction , something which allows for annihilation , creation and scattering processes to take place .    before doing so",
    ", we will rewrite the lagrangian densities of the free fields a little bit .",
    "it turns out that for the lagrangian densities ( 2.11 ) and ( 2.19 ) , the energy of the vacuum state is not finite .",
    "however , since only differences in energy are observable , we can redefine the vacuum energy such that all other energies are measured with respect to it .",
    "the removing of the infinities can be done by normal ordering of the operators , that is moving all annihilation operators to the right of the creation operators , treating them as if they all commute ( bosons ) or anticommute ( fermions ) .",
    "hence we will redefine the lagrangian densities as normal products ( denoted by n ) .",
    "the form of the interaction lagrangian density @xmath114 can be found following the procedure of incorporating an electromagnetic field into non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "there are good reasons for this form to be the correct one , but ultimately that is of course up to experiments to determine .",
    "the total lagrangian density in qed can be written as @xmath115 , with free and interaction parts given by @xmath116\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath117,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath118 is the charge of the electron . in the same way",
    ", the total hamiltonian may be divided into a free and an interaction part , @xmath119 .    due to the non - linearity of the interaction ,",
    "the coupled field equations become really hard to solve , and we have to rely on perturbation theory , which is justified thanks to the weak coupling between the free fields . to treat this situation",
    ", we have to go over from our heisenberg picture to the interaction picture , where the operators continue to satisfy the same equations of motion and the same commutation relations as the free fields in the heisenberg picture , but where the state vectors @xmath120 carry a time dependence and evolve in time in accordance with @xmath121 in the interaction picture the interaction hamiltonian , @xmath122 , also becomes time dependent , and in qed it is given through the interaction hamiltonian density @xmath123.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for a scattering process we are interested in the states a long time before ( @xmath124 ) and a long time after ( @xmath125 ) the interaction takes place .",
    "these states are related through the @xmath126-matrix defined by @xmath127 .",
    "the amplitude for an initial state @xmath128 to end up in a final state @xmath129 is correspondingly @xmath130 . by solving eq.@xmath5(2.25 )",
    "iteratively , the @xmath126-matrix is identified as the expansion @xmath131 where the integrations are over all space and time .",
    "the time - ordered product t orders the operators in chronological order with earlier times to the right .",
    "the @xmath126-matrix expansion may be written as a sum of normal products ( wick s theorem ) , so when calculating an amplitude @xmath130 we only need to pick out the parts that are able to first absorb the initial particles , and then create the final ones .",
    "when the initial and final states are specified by particles with given momenta and spin ( polarization ) , it is found that the scattering amplitude can be pictured as a set of so called feynman diagrams in momentum space .",
    "each diagram consists of external lines corresponding to the initial and final particles of the process , with internal lines and vertices in between .",
    "the internal lines may be seen as virtual particles present only during the interaction , and the number of vertices corresponds to the perturbation order .",
    "often it is accurate enough to perform the calculations to first non - vanishing order , and hence neglect all diagrams with a larger number of vertices .",
    "photons are usually pictured by wavy lines , while electrons ( positrons ) are drawn as straight lines with arrows pointing along ( against ) the time direction , which we here choose to be from the left to the right .",
    "the correspondence between scattering amplitudes and feynman diagrams may be summarized in a set of rules , the feynman rules for qed . following those we can in principle",
    "calculate the amplitude for any scattering process to any given order .",
    "we just draw all topologically different feynmann diagrams of current interest , and then via the feynman rules translate those into mathematical expressions .",
    "hence we need not deal with the equivalent , but less practical , method of identifying terms directly from the normal products following from wick s theorem .",
    "it may be pointed out that the same feynman rules are obtained by using the path integral formulation .",
    "as an example , the lowest order feynman diagrams for electron - positron pair creation is shown in figure 2.1 .",
    "the diagram represents two initial real photons , an intermediate virtual fermion , and a final electron - positron pair .",
    "= 1 mm    simple100    ( 50,40 )    when going to higher orders one encounters problems with infinities from divergent integrals , threatening to ruin the complete theory .",
    "luckily these infinities can be handled through the methods of regularization and renormalization , where the infinities are , loosely spoken , put into the relations between bare and physical particles instead .",
    "this procedure works to all orders of perturbation , and hence qed is called a renormalizable theory .",
    "it is a general feature , following from the form of the interaction hamiltonian density ( 2.26 ) , that every vertex is built up by two fermion lines and one photon line .",
    "thus we have to add more vertices in order to find a diagram which describes photon - photon scattering , that is a diagram with two photons both initially and finally .",
    "the lowest order photon - photon scattering diagram is pictured in figure 2.2 .",
    "it shows that the interaction takes place via virtual electron - positron pairs in the intermediate stage .",
    "= 1 mm    simple_box100    ( 80,60 )",
    "it may often be useful to relate the properties of the quantum vacuum to properties of a medium in classical theory .",
    "this can be done by integrating out all high - energy degrees of freedom , which are invisible in the classical low - energy domain , leaving us with an effective action from which classical equations of motion , effectively incorporating the quantum effects , can be derived .",
    "qed is a particularly nice candidate for this treatment , since it is easy to identify and separate the high energy degrees of freedom , corresponding to the massive electrons , from the low - energy massless photons .",
    "the vacuum of quantum field theory differs quite remarkably from the classical view , and is sometimes pictured as a stormy sea of fluctuations , with virtual particles constantly popping up just to quickly disappear again . since virtual particles can not be measured , a fact making any discussion about whether they really exist or not meaningless , this is of course just a mental picture .",
    "the vacuum becomes interesting when we disturb it with an external field , and observe how it responds .    for external electromagnetic fields stronger than the critical field strength of @xmath132 , qed accounts for a significant creation of real electron - positron pairs out of the vacuum .",
    "this phenomena , as well as the detailed structure of the quantum vacuum in general , is carefully treated by greiner _",
    "_ @xmath3@xcite .",
    "photon - photon scattering arises in not so strong fields , where the electron - positron pairs only appear as virtual particles in intermediate stages .",
    "the effective lagrangian density for a vacuum perturbed with a constant external electromagnetic field was presented by heisenberg and euler in 1936 @xcite , and is often referred to as the euler - heisenberg lagrangian density .",
    "the situation is of course an idealization , because of the infinite extension of the field , but is a very useful approximation if one deals with electromagnetic fields that vary little over an electron compton wavelength .",
    "this means that the euler - heisenberg lagrangian density may without problems be used for plane electromagnetic waves with wavelengths larger than @xmath2 .",
    "the formal derivation was given by schwinger in 1951 @xcite , where he used the so called proper - time method , a particularly elegant regularization procedure which explicitly deals only with gauge - covariantly objects , and thereby conserves formal gauge invariance throughout the calculations .",
    "the vacuum energy may be represented in terms of an integral with respect to a scalar variable which has many similarities with the proper time , and thereof the name of the method .",
    "the full derivation is beyond the scope of this thesis , but a nice review is given by dittrich&gies @xcite . technically speaking we integrate out the electrons and positrons coupled to the external field , i.e.@xmath3 we take care of all the internal fermion lines in feynman diagrams like figure 2.2 .",
    "this finally leads to an expression of the effective lagrangian density @xmath133 for constant external electromagnetic fields , which for relatively weak fields can be expanded as @xmath134+\\ldots\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath135 .",
    "observe that the expression is given in gaussian units , which are used from now on .",
    "@xmath136 is , as will be shown in the next section , the classical lagrangian density , while @xmath137 represents the non - linear qed - correction .",
    "since @xmath138 is very small , the correction is negligible for weak fields .",
    "also note the vanishing of @xmath137 for parallel propagating waves .",
    "we repeat that eq.@xmath5(3.1 ) is valid for field strengths below @xmath1 and wavelengths larger than @xmath2 , conditions which are met for all electromagnetic waves considered in this work .    a new quasi - classical theory , describing the quantum effects in a classical language ,",

    "due to rapid oscillations , all terms with non - zero exponents",
    "will then average to zero and be negligible .",
    "thanks to the matching conditions ( 4.3 ) and ( 4.4 ) , there is a term that will survive on the right hand side , namely the one including the product @xmath209 . thus there is no need to ever consider the other terms , an insight which definitely makes the calculations easier . when evaluating the right hand side of a wave equation like ( 4.2 ) we only have to keep track of the resonant terms , that is only determine one of the in total 120 different @xmath199 .",
    "similar arguments of course works for the other three waves .",
    "so by neglecting all non - resonant terms , we end up with wave equations looking like @xmath210 @xmath211 @xmath212 @xmath213 where @xmath214 are the coupling coefficients , and @xmath215 are unit vectors .",
    "next assume that initially one field is much weaker than the others , say for instance @xmath216 . from eqs.@xmath5(4.8)-(4.11 )",

    "the wave vectors satisfy the equation @xmath221 and we make the definitions @xmath222 and @xmath223 . from the above discussion",
    "it is clear we expect a wave to be generated in the @xmath224-direction , but how about directions differing only slightly from it ? to clear this out we write the generated field @xmath225 as @xmath226 where @xmath227 is the part corresponding to @xmath228 .",

    "the term @xmath233 is kept inside the integral since the fields will only occupy a limited region of spacetime .",

    "note that the solution takes the form of an outgoing spherical wave , multiplied by a direction dependent factor peaked for @xmath244 .        in order to take advantage of the resonance phenomena discussed in the last section , we need to find a configuration of plane waves with wave vectors satisfying the matching conditions ( 4.3 ) and ( 4.4 ) , or equivalently @xmath201 @xmath245 these conditions correspond to momentum and energy conservations respectively .",
    "( compare with the momentum @xmath246 and energy @xmath247 of a photon . )",
    "let us first discuss some questions that may arise if one is not familiar with this kind of wave interactions .",
    "the form of the matching conditions screams for the interpretation of wave one and two as incoming photons , while wave three and four should represent the scattered ones .",
    "but in the experiment we will have three incoming waves generating a fourth one , so how does this then make sense ?",
    "well , the problem has already been translated from qed into classical electrodynamics via the effective lagrangian , and we should in fact no longer have to interpret the waves as particles .",
    "we are free to choose whatever matching conditions we like to , and as long as the calculations end up with something useful , one should in principle be satisfied .",
    "however , there is a simple way of thinking which may help .",
    "we can see the third wave as an additional external contribution to the particles scattered in the @xmath248-direction , with the purpose of stimulating the scattering in the @xmath224-direction , i.e.@xmath3 making the right hand side of eq.@xmath5(4.11 ) larger .",
    "another question is why it is not enough with just three waves , two incoming and a third being generated ?",
    "since the non - linear terms are cubic in the fields , the wave vectors then have to satisfy matching conditions like @xmath249 , @xmath250 or @xmath251 , @xmath252 .",

    "a glance at eq.@xmath5(5.8 ) gives us the insight that we should try to choose the @xmath312 such that the terms including the factor 7/4 play a greater role .",
    "this can be done by taking @xmath395 and @xmath396 , and thereby increase the squared geometric factor to @xmath397 .",
    "inspection of eq.@xmath5(5.20 ) inspires to choose @xmath395 and @xmath398 , giving @xmath399 , so the two cases are still of the same order .",
    "guided by this , we choose from this point to abandon all three dimensional configurations , and put focus on two dimensions only .",
    "if this does not seem well - reasoned , it is just because we have not considered the most interesting two dimensional case yet .",
    "let us do that right now .        in the model discussed above ,",
    "the side length of the cubic interaction region is , due to the chosen geometry , determined by the width @xmath355 of the incoming laser pulses .",
    "the peaked value of the generated intensity is directly proportional to @xmath400 , i.e.@xmath3 to the square of the interaction volume .",
    "however , since it is the power of the lasers which is limited , an increase of the beam cross section area must be accompanied by a corresponding reduction of intensity , keeping the peaked generated intensity unaffected .",
    "we may now ask ourselves if it is possible to find another configuration , with the same beam parameters used as previous , but with a considerably larger volume of interaction ?",
    "if so , we expect the scattered intensity to be higher , at least as long as nothing dramatic at the same time happens with the geometric factor",
    ".    since the pulse length often exceeds the pulse width with at least an order of magnitude , it would be nice if the size of the interaction region somehow could depend on it .",
    "this is indeed the case when the incoming pulses travel along the same line in space , two overlapping waves in one direction and a third in the opposite , eventually colliding head - on at some point ( the origin ) .",
    "we choose to arrange our coordinate system such that this one dimensional configuration is described by @xmath401 , @xmath277 and @xmath402 .",
    "moreover we assume that all three pulses are of the same kind , and in specific @xmath403 . the matching conditions ( 4.23)-(4.25 )",
    "are then satisfied for @xmath266 , @xmath404 and @xmath392 .",
    "now try to imagine what this region of interaction will be like . since wave one and three",
    "are overlapping , these can be pictured as a single parallel epiped with length @xmath405 and cross section area @xmath406 , moving to the left along the x - axis .",
    "consequently a similar parallel epiped traveling in the opposite direction then corresponds to wave two .",
    "as before , the interaction volume is defined as the part of space where all three incoming pulses are present , i.e.@xmath3 the region where the two colliding parallel epipeds overlap . when passing through each other , the pulses give rise to an interaction volume of the form of a parallel epiped with width and hight @xmath355 in the y- and z - directions , but with a time dependent length @xmath407 in the x - direction .",
    "let @xmath408 denote the pulse duration , and the time @xmath409 to be fixed at the moment when the edges of the pulses first meet at the origin .",
    "the length @xmath407 will thus increase linearly from @xmath410 to its maximum @xmath411 , and then decrease linearly down to @xmath412 again .      from eq.@xmath5(4.15 )",
    "it is clear that what we really are interested in is how the length depends on the retarded time @xmath234 , and not on @xmath235 .",
    "as we are about to measure the scattered intensity close to the @xmath337-direction out in the radiation zone , we investigate what @xmath413 will look like when the observer is situated far away on the positive x - axis . at the very first moment when the incoming pulses overlap",
    ", some initially generated radiation will leave the region with the speed of light , going in the @xmath337-direction .",
    "but wave two is also traveling with the same speed in the same direction , so all radiation generated at later times at the edge of it will reach the observer exactly at the same moment as the portion initially generated .",
    "since wave one and three both have the opposite velocity of the second , the front of wave two will be situated outside the interaction region as soon as it has crossed @xmath414 , and hence no more radiation is generated from that edge .",
    "the first scattered radiation reaching the observer thus comes from a parallel epiped with length @xmath415 situated between @xmath416 and @xmath414 .",
    "the scattering occurring at the end of pulse two is obviously the last portion arriving at the observer , and a similar mental picture tells us it comes from an equally sized parallel epiped , now located between @xmath417 and @xmath416 . in the same way it is easy to convince oneself that for any intermediate portion of radiation received by the observer , the size of the region it comes from is always the same , it is just moving continuously with half the speed of light in the negative x - direction .",
    "hence we conclude that @xmath418 during some time interval of length @xmath419 , and zero otherwise .",
    "an expression for the generated intensity during this time interval is thus found in the same way as for the cubic interaction volume , provided we replace the limits of integration @xmath420 with @xmath421 .",
    "the generated intensity for this configuration then becomes @xmath422}{\\left(\\cos\\phi_{4}-\\cos\\phi\\sin\\theta\\right)^{2}}\\frac{\\sin^{2}\\left[k_{4}\\frac{b}{2}\\left(\\sin\\phi_{4}-\\sin\\phi\\sin\\theta\\right)\\right]}{\\left(\\sin\\phi_{4}-\\sin\\phi\\sin\\theta\\right)^{2}}\\nonumber \\\\&&\\!\\!\\!\\!\\times\\frac{\\sin^{2}\\left[k_{4}\\frac{b}{2}\\left(\\cos\\theta\\right)\\right]}{\\left(\\cos\\theta\\right)^{2}}{g}^{2}_{2d}i_{1}i_{2}i_{3},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the limit in the resonant direction @xmath423      from eqs.@xmath5(6.18 ) and ( 6.23 ) we find the ratio between the peak intensities of the parallel epiped region and the cubic region to be @xmath424 for most laser pulses",
    "@xmath425 , and hence the configuration giving rise to the parallel epiped interaction region seems to be the favourable .",
    "let us just make a quick check to ensure nothing terrible happens with the geometric factor . for simplicity",
    "we choose the polarizations @xmath325 ( the optimization will be considered in the next chapter ) .",
    "insertion of @xmath426 , @xmath278 in eq.@xmath5(5.11 ) leads to the result @xmath427 by comparing this to the geometric factor for a cubic interaction region ( 6.20 ) , we see that in fact @xmath428 , so there is really nothing to worry about .",
    "as pointed out in section 4.2 , our choice of configuration brings about some practical problems concerning the detection of the scattered photons .",
    "this can , as discussed , be overcome by a shifting of some frequencies and angles , leaving us with a configuration slightly different from that investigated above .",
    "however , for the small changes we are going to make , it will be justified to continue using the results derived in this chapter .",
    "the vulcan laser at the rutherford appleton laboratory , capable of delivering petawatt shots , is an interesting candidate to use for detection of photon - photon scattering . as is the planned x - ray free electron laser at desy , based on a technique quite different from ordinary lasers . in this chapter",
    "we investigate and discuss the detection possibilities for both of these alternatives .        since the 1960s when the pulsed laser was invented ,",
    "the peak power has increased by twelve orders of magnitude through a succession of leaps @xcite .",
    "after a few years the first free running lasers had been improved , first through the process of q - switching and then by mode locking , such that the pulse duration could be cut down from nanoseconds to picoseconds for the same amount of energy .",
    "consequently the power was pushed a million times from kilowatts to gigawatts .",
    "although some minor amplifications were accomplished during the following two decades , the high intensities of the ultrashort pulses prevented any larger increase of the peak power . at the associated intensities of gigawatts per square centimeter , non - linear optical responses in the gain media imposed an intensity limit for the laser .",
    "this is due to that the material refractive index shows up a linear dependence on the intensity at such high values , and thus causes a deformation of the beam .",
    "even if some progress were made in lowering the pulse duration down to femtoseconds , no increase in power could at the same time be achieved .",
    "thanks to the technique of chirped pulse amplification ( cpa ) demonstrated in the mid 1980s , this problem was mainly solved . in cpa one",
    "basically takes an ultrashort pulse , stretches it @xmath429@xmath430 times and thereby reduces the intensity , amplifies it , and finally recompresses it back to its original shape again . by doing the amplification during the stretched ( chirped ) intermediate state of low intensity",
    ", one gets around the problem with non - linear optical effects .",
    "the stretching can be done by passing the pulse through a dispersive delay line , and thereby separate the spectral components of the wave packet . for ultrashort pulses the bandwidth gets large , and",
    "hence it is important that the amplification is the same over a large range of wavelengths .",
    "the compression , performed by a conjugate delay line , must be perfectly matched to the stretching in order to restore the shape of the pulse .",
    "the cpa lead to the development of terawatt lasers , and in last years several petawatt upgrade projects have started .",
    "we will put our focus on the vulcan laser at the rutherford appleton laboratory , which fired its first petawatt shot as recent as 5th october 2004 .",
    "the vulcan laser @xcite is capable of delivering @xmath431 in a single @xmath432 pulse at wavelength @xmath433 , generating a power of @xmath434 .",
    "the beam can be focused to an intensity of @xmath435 on target , corresponding to a beam cross section area of @xmath436 .",
    "the repetition rate takes on the moderate value of one shot per hour .    in reality the shape of the pulse is of course more complex than a parallel epiped of constant intensity , but in order to get something out in a fairly simple way we will stick to the model in chapter 6 .",
    "anyway , we are not aiming for any detailed calculation of the scattered number of photons , but only a nice estimation .      to carry out the experiment ,",
    "three incoming beams are needed .",
    "thus we have to split the petawatt pulse into three parts , each with a third of the original energy .",
    "this may for instance be done with the help of two beam splitters , but the exact procedure will be left for the experimentalists .",
    "we hence start out with three beams , each of the same spatial shape and wavelength as the original , but with energy , power and intensity cut down by a factor one third .    in chapter 6 the most promising geometric configuration",
    "was found to be described by the parameters @xmath437 , @xmath277 , @xmath278 , @xmath438 . on arranging the incoming beams like this ,",
    "we expect a generated intensity as in the expressions ( 6.22 ) and ( 6.23 ) . the pulse length is now given by @xmath439 , while the width is from the cross section area found to be @xmath440 .",
    "we also have the wave vector @xmath441 and the intensities of the incoming waves @xmath442 ( where @xmath443 and @xmath49 are the wavelength and intensity of the original beam ) .",
    "we are now ready to substitute these numerical values into eqs.@xmath5(6.22 ) and ( 6.23 ) , and find out what the generated intensity will look like at different spots . to get a picture of the angular distribution of scattered radiation , the ratio @xmath444}{\\left(1-\\cos\\phi\\sin\\theta\\right)^{2}}\\frac{\\sin^{2}\\left[k_{4}\\frac{b}{2}\\left(\\sin\\phi\\sin\\theta\\right)\\right]}{\\left(\\sin\\phi\\sin\\theta\\right)^{2}}\\nonumber \\\\&&\\!\\!\\!\\!\\times\\frac{\\sin^{2}\\left[k_{4}\\frac{b}{2}\\left(\\cos\\theta\\right)\\right]}{\\left(\\cos\\theta\\right)^{2}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( where we have substituted @xmath392 ) is in figure 7.1 plotted as a function of @xmath445 and @xmath54 , for the current values of the parameters @xmath241 , @xmath355 and @xmath405 . in the limit of fixing @xmath365 , the ratio as",
    "a function of the deviation @xmath54 from the resonant direction becomes @xmath446}{\\left(1-\\cos\\phi\\right)^{2}}\\frac{\\sin^{2}\\left[k_{4}\\frac{b}{2}\\left(\\sin\\phi\\right)\\right]}{\\left(\\sin\\phi\\right)^{2}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    ( 7.1 ) , for the vulcan laser_.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    and is plotted in figure 7.2 , where the interference pattern might be seen somewhat clearer .",
    "fixing @xmath447 instead , gives a dependence on the deviation @xmath448 from resonance as @xmath449}{\\left(1-\\cos\\vartheta\\right)^{2}}\\frac{\\sin^{2}\\left[k_{4}\\frac{b}{2}\\left(\\sin\\vartheta\\right)\\right]}{\\left(\\sin\\vartheta\\right)^{2}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] i.e.@xmath3 of exactly the same form as the ratio ( 7.2 ) , as expected from the symmetry of our chosen geometric configuration .     from resonance ,",
    "eq.@xmath5(7.2 ) , for the vulcan laser_.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]      the total generated power @xmath450 is found from integrating the intensity over a spherical shell ( with radius @xmath92 ) centred at the origin , that is @xmath451 where @xmath452}{\\left(1-\\cos\\phi\\sin\\theta\\right)^{2}}\\frac{\\sin^{2}\\left[k_{4}\\frac{b}{2}\\left(\\sin\\phi\\sin\\theta\\right)\\right]}{\\left(\\sin\\phi\\sin\\theta\\right)^{2}}\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\!\\!\\!\\!\\times\\frac{\\sin^{2}\\left[k_{4}\\frac{b}{2}\\left(\\cos\\theta\\right)\\right]}{\\left(\\cos\\theta\\right)^{2}}\\sin\\theta ~d\\theta ~d\\phi.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the form eq.@xmath5(7.4 ) is written on tells us that about the same power would be generated by an intensity profile of constant magnitude @xmath453 spanning a square with the side of an angle @xmath454 .",
    "a numerical solution of eq.@xmath5(7.5 ) gives the value @xmath455 for our case of interest .",
    "the central interference peak in figure 7.1 is definitely the most dominating , and integrating over just that region does not have any noticeable effects on @xmath454 .",
    "it is clear that all but a negligible part of the power is generated into the central peak directions . from figures 7.1 and 7.2",
    "we see that @xmath454 is around half of the peak width , something which seems very reasonable .",
    "if we had not done the integration , this is probably what we would have guessed just from inspection of the plots .",
    "putting eqs.@xmath5(6.23 ) and ( 7.4 ) together yields @xmath456 the time of interaction equals the pulse duration @xmath408 , so the total radiated energy is given by @xmath457 each generated photon carries an energy of @xmath458 , and hence the estimated number of scattered photons per shot becomes @xmath459      all there is left to find is a value for the geometric factor @xmath324 given by eq.@xmath5(5.8 ) . due to the one dimensional structure of the configuration",
    ", the optimization is in this case simple to perform .",
    "since all waves travel along the x - axis , we can always arrange our coordinate system such that the optimal @xmath324 lies along the z - axis .",
    "in fact , due to the symmetry of the configuration there must be geometric factors of exactly the same magnitudes pointing in every direction perpendicular to the x - axis .",
    "anyway , we choose to maximize the magnitude of the z - component , which with the current angles imposed takes the form @xmath460 an upper limit is consequently @xmath461 , which in fact can be achieved by taking @xmath462 and @xmath463 .",
    "it is easy to check that the x- and y - components in this case vanish , as they should .",
    "hence we conclude that we have found an optimal choice of polarization angles .",
    "finally we plug in all the numerical values into eq.@xmath5(7.8 ) , and find the estimated number of scattered photons per shot to be @xmath464 , an amount which is definitely detectable .",
    "it may be pointed out that in the earlier discussed case with a cubic interaction region , the width of the central peak becomes almost the same as above , and hence @xmath454 does not change very much . using eq.@xmath5(6.24 )",
    "we conclude that the number of scattered photons is reduced by at least two orders of magnitude compared to the above result .    for practical reasons ,",
    "the choice of @xmath426 and @xmath465 have to be slightly altered .",
    "we want the detector to be able to pick up all of the intensity generated into the central interference peak , i.e.@xmath3 we have to make sure no other beams are present in that region .",
    "following the discussion in section 4.2 , such a modified configuration is given by @xmath285 , @xmath286 , @xmath287 , @xmath466 , @xmath289 , @xmath290 , where @xmath280 has to be chosen as half the peak width . in this case",
    "it means @xmath467 .",
    "thus we must shift the frequencies of beam two and three by a factor of @xmath468 , giving us the new wavelengths @xmath469 and wave vectors @xmath470 .",
    "as before , we leave the technicalities of how to perform this shift to the experimentalists .",
    "since such small modifications are done , we will continue to use the same interaction model , leading to eq.@xmath5(7.8 ) .",
    "all parameters are the same as earlier , except for @xmath388 which has to be recalculated for the new angles .",
    "putting @xmath471 , @xmath472 , @xmath473 and @xmath466 into eq.@xmath5(5.8 ) , with @xmath462 and @xmath463 , gives @xmath474 .",
    "actually this brings the number of scattered photons per shot down a bit , but the rounded off value will still be @xmath464 .      it is time to summarize the situation , and suggest a single experiment in which photon - photon scattering may be detected .",
    "the recipe goes as follows : take the petawatt pulse of wavelength @xmath475 produced by the vulcan laser , and split it into three equal parts .",
    "shift the wavelengths of the second and third pulses to @xmath476 .",
    "let the pulses enter the x - y - plane at the angles @xmath471 , @xmath472 and @xmath477 , and with @xmath462 and @xmath463 , corresponding to polarization of pulse one and three in the x - y - plane while pulse two is polarized in the z - direction .",
    "also synchronize the pulses to reach the origin at the same moment . on the x - axis ,",
    "place a detector which at least spans the intervals @xmath478 and @xmath479 .    for each shot",
    ", we expect several scattered photons to be detected .",
    "( more precisely our model predicts the average number to be 22 , but we have to keep in mind that a lot of approximations have been made .",
    "what is important is that the amount of generated photons definitely is detectable . )",
    "another interesting candidate to use for detection of photon - photon scattering is the xfel ( x - ray free electron laser ) .",
    "such a laser is planned as a part of the design of the superconducting electron - positron collider tesla ( tev - energy superconducting linear accelerator ) , at desy ( deutsches electronen - synchrotron ) , hamburg @xcite .",
    "the facility is scheduled to take up operation in 2012 .",
    "tesla mainly consists of a @xmath480 long tunnel containing two linear accelerators , one for the electrons and one for the positrons , meeting at a collision site in the middle .",
    "the collider is capable of initially @xmath481 total energy , but is extendable to @xmath482 .",
    "the first low energy part of the electron accelerator can also provide an electron beam for the xfel .",
    "the xfel is based on the principle of sase ( self - amplified spontaneous emission ) , which can be summarized as follows : the high energy electrons coming from the accelerator is guided into an undulator , an arrangement of magnets forcing the electrons to follow a winding periodic slalom course .",
    "due to these accelerations the electrons emit concentrated x - ray flashes , which will overtake the electrons ahead of them .",
    "the passing by of the photons causes the electrons to organize themselves into thin layers , and at the end of the undulator this structure is fully developed .",
    "the electrons in a certain layer will now emit radiation in a synchronized way , and hence produce high - intensity ultra - short x - ray pulses with laser light properties .",
    "this is quite different from how a traditional laser works , and one of the main advantages is that the wavelength easily may be altered by adjusting the electron acceleration .",
    "the xfel attracts scientists from many different disciplines including physics , chemistry , material science and structural biology . here",
    "we will investigate how well it can be used for detection of photon - photon scattering .      according to the predicted photon beam parameters",
    ", the xfel will be able to produce @xmath483 pulses at wavelength @xmath484 , with @xmath485 duration and a pulse width of @xmath486",
    ". the repetition rate will be as high as @xmath0 pulses per second .",
    "however , the expected coherence time is only @xmath487 , and hence it should be more accurate to model each pulse as a stream of subpulses , each with a length equal to the coherence length of @xmath488 .",
    "the repetition rate may then be expressed as @xmath489 subpulses per second .      guided by the above properties , and on following the same method as for the vulcan laser , we model the incoming subpulses as parallel epipeds with parameter values given by @xmath490 , @xmath491 , @xmath492 and @xmath493 .",
    "figure 7.3 , a plot of the intensity distribution ( 7.2 ) , guides us to assign the value @xmath494 .",
    "using the same geometrical factor as in the last section , eq.@xmath5(7.8 ) finally gives us @xmath495 .",
    "taking the repetition rate into account , about @xmath496 photons will be generated per second , and we may have to wait more than 30 million years to detect the first scattered photon .",
    "it looks like the high frequency and repetition rate of the xfel are unable to compensate for its low power .     from resonance ,",
    "eq.@xmath5(7.2 ) , for the original beams of the xfel_.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the configuration used here is however not the optimal . since we are dealing with pulses which are wider than long , we should instead consider the case with a cubic interaction region , as in section 6.1 . by performing the substitution @xmath497 in eqs.@xmath5(7.1 ) ,",
    "( 7.2 ) and ( 7.5 ) we get the correct formulas for the intensity distribution and @xmath498 in this case",
    ". in fact a plot of the intensity distribution as a function of the deviation from the resonant direction will look almost exactly like figure 7.3 , and we may continue to use @xmath494 . hence we can estimate the scattering number for the optimal configuration from eq.@xmath5(6.24 ) .",
    "inserting @xmath499 , and with the other parameter values as above , we see that the scattering number is increased by a factor @xmath500 relative to the first result . anyway",
    ", the scattering rate is still far to low , making it practically impossible to detect photon - photon scattering through this experiment .    despite the negative results above",
    ", there is still some hope left .",
    "it may be possible , with future technology , to focus the width of the x - rays down to the theoretical diffraction limit of the order of one wavelength , i.e.@xmath3 @xmath501 @xcite . as a realistic value of the pulse width achievable in 2012 we take @xmath502 , a compression of the original value by @xmath430 times .",
    "correspondingly the intensity of each beam is increased by a factor @xmath503 . from figure 7.4 , where eq.@xmath5(7.2 ) is plotted for these new values , we estimate @xmath504 .",
    "the scattered number of photons per subpulse predicted by our model , given by eq.@xmath5(7.8 ) , becomes @xmath505 .",
    "hence we arrive at the incredible result of @xmath0 scattered photons per second .     from resonance , eq.@xmath5(7.2 )",
    ", for the focused beams of the xfel_.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]        we can not expect our simple model to predict any exact scattering numbers , but only estimate the order of magnitudes . in order to produce more precise numbers and intensity distributions to compare with experimental outcomes",
    ", we have to make some improvements .",
    "the modeling of the laser pulses as parallel epipeds of constant field strength serves our purpose of keeping the calculations analytical and simple well , but a more realistic approach would be to use pulses with a gaussian - like distributed electric field strength , both in the radial direction as well as in the direction of propagation .",
    "this of course complicates the shape of the interaction region , and we have to rely on numerical calculations .",
    "no gaussian models will be considered here , but such calculations would be an interesting follow up to this work .",
    "moreover , we have not really taken the effects of the bandwidth into detailed account .",
    "this may especially be important for the xfel , due to its short coherence time , and a deeper investigation would possibly lead to some modifications .",
    "the improvements may however be overshadowed by practical errors , such as difficulties to tune the laser pulses exactly as we want them , or problems with creating a sufficiently good vacuum .",
    "there is really no meaning in calculating very precise scattering rates , as long as the experimental uncertainty widely exceeds the accuracy of the theory . in the first place we are really just asking ourselves whether some scattering can be measured at all , and the model used in this work should definitely be good enough to answer such a question",
    "anyway , what could be compared with experimental results is how the scattering number depends on the polarizations of the incoming beams .",
    "as long as the pulses in reality are symmetric around the axis of propagation , the ratios between the number of scattered photons for different sets of polarizations are independent of how the pulses are modeled .",
    "a sequence of experiments , each with different polarizations but otherwise the same , would hence work as a test of the results derived in chapter 5 .",
    "although this thesis has been pervaded by adjustments to suit the vulcan laser and the xfel well , there should be no big problems to modify the calculations to fit other situations as well .",
    "for instance it may be practically favourable to use different kinds of lasers , with different beam parameters , in the same experiment",
    ". we may not be able to follow exactly the same procedure of finding resonant configurations , and it may not be possible to model the interaction region in exactly the same way as here , but the basic approach will be the same , and the modifications needed should be quite easy to figure out .",

    "<S> according to the theory of quantum electrodynamics , photon - photon scattering can take place via exchange of virtual electron - positron pairs . </S>",
    "<S> effectively , the interaction can be formulated in terms of non - linear corrections to maxwell s equations , and hence may be treated by classical non - linear electrodynamics . due to the strong electromagnetic fields needed to reach any noticeable effect , </S>",
    "<S> photon - photon scattering has not yet been observed experimentally , but recent improvements in laser technology have increased the possibility of direct detection . </S>",
    "<S> a verification of the phenomena would be of great scientific value as a confirmation of quantum electrodynamics .    in this thesis </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of direct detection of elastic photon - photon scattering through four - wave coupling is investigated , both for current and future systems . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown how three colliding laser pulses satisfying certain matching conditions , can generate scattered radiation in a fourth resonant direction . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction is modeled , and the number of scattered photons is estimated for optimized configurations of incoming pulses , both for the vulcan laser at the rutherford appleton laboratory as well as for the planned xfel at desy . </S>",
    "<S> an experiment using the vulcan laser is predicted to produce 22 scattered photons per shot , an amount which is definitely detectable . </S>",
    "<S> the usefulness of the xfel highly depends on future developments in laser technology , but a realistic estimation gives a result of @xmath0 scattered photons per second .    </S>",
