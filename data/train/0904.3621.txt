    "recently , it has been revealed that there are natural and profound connections between quantum information theory and braid group theory @xcite . in a recent paper by franko , rowell and",
    "wang @xcite , the images of the unitary braid group representations generated by the original @xmath2 bell matrix have been identified as extensions of extraspecial 2-groups @xcite .",
    "extraspecial 2-groups are now known to play an interesting role in theory of quantum information , particularly in the theory of quantum error correction .",
    "they provide a bridge between quantum error correcting codes and binary orthogonal geometry @xcite .",
    "moreover , they form a subgroup of the pauli group , which is of importance in the theory of stablized code @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors utilized extraspecial 2-groups to study the images of braid group @xmath9 under the representation associated with the @xmath10 bell matrix .",
    "it is found that the extraspecial 2-groups are the central link between almost - complex structures and unitary braid representations .",
    "new higher dimensional unitary braid group representations can be constructed by considering an extension of the extraspecial 2-groups @xcite .",
    "many efforts have been devoted to investigate the braiding operators and yang - baxter eqauation ( ybe ) to the field of quantum information and quantum computation .",
    "this provides a novel way to study the quantum entanglement @xcite .",
    "it is shown that braiding transformation is a natural approach describing quantum entanglement by applying the unitary braiding operators to realize entanglement swapping and generate the ghz states as well as the linear cluster states .",
    "unitary solutions of braid group relation @xcite and the ybe @xcite can be identified with universal quantum gates @xcite .",
    "the investigation of many types of yang - baxter systems have attracted researchers attention .",
    "usually , a hamiltonian can be constructed from the unitary @xmath8 matrix by yang - baxterization approach .",
    "yang - baxterization @xcite is exploited @xcite to derive the hamiltonian for the unitary evolution of entangled states .    in this paper , we present a new @xmath0 @xmath1 matrix from the @xmath2 @xmath3 matrix , where @xmath1/@xmath3 is the image of braid group representation . in sec",
    "[ sec2 ] , we briefly review the yang - baxter systems of @xmath2 @xmath3 matrix . then we construct a new @xmath0 @xmath1 matrix , which satisfies the extraspecial 2-groups algebra relation , from the @xmath2 @xmath3 matrix . by using yang - baxterization approach , we derive a unitary @xmath8 matrix based on the @xmath0 @xmath1-matrix .",
    "we analyze the effect of @xmath8 matrix on the entanglement of three qubits . in sec",
    "[ sec3 ] , we construct a hamiltonian of 3 qubits from the unitary @xmath8 matrix and investigate the entanglement and berry phase of this system .",
    "the results are summarized in the last section .",
    "for @xmath10 yang - baxter systems of 2 qubits , we know that the rational solution of the ybe can be expressed as @xmath11@xcite , where @xmath7 is the spectral parameter and @xmath12 is an operator of braid group which can be expressed in the form of spin operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 as follows @xmath15 the operator @xmath12 satisfies the extraspecial 2-groups relations @xcite : @xmath16 in terms of the standard basis @xmath17 of 2 qubits , the @xmath12 matrix is of the following form : @xmath18 when the unitary matrix @xmath19=@xmath20 acts on the standard basis of 2 qubits , one gets four entangled states which possess the same entanglement degree of @xmath21 @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we construct a @xmath4 matrix @xmath22 from this @xmath23 matrix m. in order to connect three qubits , we write @xmath22 by using @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath22 can be expressed by using spin operators : @xmath26\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] write in terms of the basis of three qubits @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , the @xmath4 matrix @xmath35 is @xmath36 introduce @xmath37 , it is not difficult to find that @xmath1 satisfies the following extraspecial 2-groups relations @xcite : @xmath38    it is known that a unitary solution of the ybe can be found via yang - baxterization on the solution of the extraspecial 2-groups relations .",
    "the yang - baxterization of the extraspecial 2-group operator @xmath1 is @xcite : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and g(x ) are some functions of @xmath41 to be determined , @xmath42 is identity matrix .",
    "one can choose appropriate @xmath40 and @xmath43 so that @xmath44 is unitary .",
    "the unitary @xmath45-matrix satisfies the ybe which is of the form , @xmath46 where multiplicative parameters @xmath41 and @xmath47 are known as the spectral parameters . in order to make @xmath44 a unitary matrix",
    ", @xmath48 should be equal to the inverse @xmath49 . in this way",
    ", we obtain that @xmath50 . by introducing a new variable parameter @xmath7 as @xmath51 and @xmath52 ,",
    "the matrix @xmath44 can be rewritten as @xmath53=@xmath54 = @xmath55 . in the following ,",
    "we express @xmath56 in the form of spin operators @xmath57 when the unitary matrix @xmath56 acts on the direct product states @xmath58 for convenience we label the @xmath59-th , @xmath60-th , and @xmath61-th qubits by a , b , and c respectively .",
    "tripartite entangled states can be measured by three - tangle ( or residual tangle ) @xmath62 proposed by coffman , kudu , and wootters @xcite .",
    "@xmath62 is expressed by using the composing coefficients @xmath63 corresponding to the basis state @xmath64 , @xmath65 the above eight 3-qubit entangled states are found to have the same entanglement degree as @xmath66    the concurrunce @xcite measuring bipartite entangled states is defined as @xmath67 where @xmath68 are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath69 , here @xmath70 is the density matrix of the pair and it can be either pure or mixed with @xmath71 denoting the complex conjugate of @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the pauli matrices for atoms 1 and 2 .",
    "this quantity attains its maximum value of 1 for maximally entangled states and vanishes for separable states .    for the 2-qubit subsystem of three qubits , we need consider the reduced density .",
    "i.e. @xmath74 , here @xmath72 is the density of 3 qubits .",
    "it is pure and has the form @xmath75 . though calculating the reduced density of the eight 3 qubits states we get in eq ( [ tai ] ) , it is not difficult to obtain the corresponding concurrences as follows @xmath76 it is worth noting that the eight 3 qubits state we get in eq ( [ tai ] ) all have the same pairwise concurrence as eq ( [ c2 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the entanglement between qubit a and the pair bc can be calculated @xcite as @xmath77 thus we have @xmath78 one can easily verfiy that @xmath79 .",
    "so it is worth noting that by this @xmath0 @xmath56 acting on the product states of 3 qubits , one can also get eight tripartite entangled states with the same degree of entanglement .",
    "while for the @xmath2 yang - baxter system , they get the same entanglement degree of 2 qubits @xmath80 . from eqs ( [ t1 ] ) , ( [ c2 ] ) and ( [ c4 ] ) , one can see that when @xmath81 @xmath82 and @xmath83= @xmath62=1 .",
    "this case is just the ghz state @xcite . according to eq .",
    "( [ t1 ] ) , when @xmath84 , the three - tangle @xmath62 is equal to 0 and @xmath85 .",
    "this tells us that the states in eq .",
    "( [ tai ] ) are separable in this case .",
    "when @xmath86=0 , @xmath87 while @xmath62=0 .",
    "this corresponds to the w state @xcite .",
    "so one can see the @xmath0 @xmath56 generates arbitrary tripartite entangled states which can be achieved depending on the parameters @xmath7 .",
    "generally , multi - spin interaction hamiltonians can be constructed based on the ybe . as @xmath45 is unitary",
    ", it can define the evolution of a state @xmath88 @xmath89 is time - dependent , which can be realized by specifying corresponding time - dependent parameter of @xmath90 . by taking partial derivative of the state @xmath91 with respect to time @xmath92 , we have an equation @xmath93\\breve{r}_i(t)|\\psi(0)\\rangle\\nonumber \\\\ & = & h(t)|\\psi(t)\\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 is the hamiltonian governing the evolution of the state @xmath91 .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian @xmath95 for the yang - baxter system is derived through the yang - baxterization approach .",
    "there are two parameters @xmath7 and @xmath6 in the unitary matrix @xmath8 .",
    "consider that @xmath7 is time - independent and @xmath6 is time - dependent , a hamiltonian can be constructed from the matrix @xmath8 as done in refs.@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath96 \\nonumber\\\\ + \\frac{1}{3}\\hbar\\dot{\\varphi}\\cos^{2}\\theta [ 2(s_{i}^{3}+s_{i+1}^{3}+s_{i+2}^{3})+2s_{i+1}^{3}(s_{i}^{+}s_{i+2}^{-}+s_{i}^{-}s_{i+2}^{+ } ) \\nonumber\\\\-(s_{i}^{+}s_{i+1}^{-}+s_{i+1}^{+}s_{i+2}^{- } + s_{i}^{-}s_{i+1}^{+}+s_{i+1}^{-}s_{i+2}^{+})]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can find the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenstates as follows , @xmath97 it is clear that four of the eigenstates @xmath98 can be decomposed to two - qubit entangled states and single - qubit states .",
    "we get @xmath99=0 since there exists no 3-qubit entanglement for the four states",
    ". one can easily understand that when any pair of qubit in a 3-qubit system has maximal entanglement , 3-qubit entanglement will vanish . according to eq .",
    "( [ con ] ) , by calculating the reduced density for the first four eigenstates , we have @xmath100 for the state @xmath101 , @xmath102 for the state @xmath103 , @xmath104 for the state @xmath105 and @xmath106 for the state @xmath107",
    ". one can easily understand that when any pair of qubit in a 3-qubit system has maximal entanglement , 3-qubit entanglement will vanish .",
    "the other four eigenstates @xmath108 are 3-qubit entangled states .",
    "these eigenstates have the same 3-tangle @xmath109 .    according to berry s theory @xcite , when the parameter @xmath6 evolves adiabatically from 0 to 2@xmath110 , the berry phase accumulated is , @xmath111 from eq .",
    "( [ x1 ] ) , one can see that the berry phase of the states @xmath101 , @xmath103 , @xmath105 , @xmath107 are zero .",
    "while for the other four states , we obtain the berry phases in the following , @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the solid angle enclosed by the loop on the bloch sphere .",
    "introduce three operators @xmath114 it is not difficult to find that @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "we thus have a @xmath117 group formed by the three operators , fulfilling conditions @xmath118=2i_{3}$ ] and @xmath119=\\pm i_{\\pm}$ ] .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ h0 ] ) can be rewritten by using the operators @xmath120 where the parameters @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 .",
    "this is the reason that berry phase of the 3-qubit yang - baxter system is the consistence with that of the 2-qubit yang - baxter system @xcite .",
    "we also get the same eigenvalues of hamiltonian ( [ h0 ] ) as those of the 2-qubit system @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have discussed a new @xmath0 extraspecial 2-groups operator @xmath1 extending from the @xmath2 extraspecial 2-groups operator @xmath3 .",
    "a unitary @xmath8 matrix is constructed by the yang - baxterization approach .",
    "3-qubit entangled states can be achieved by acting the unitary @xmath8 matrix on the product states of 3-qubit .",
    "remarkably the eight states have the same degree of entanglement , and arbitrary tripartite entangled states can be achieved depending on the parameters @xmath7 .",
