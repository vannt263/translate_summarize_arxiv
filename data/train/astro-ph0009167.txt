    "strong constraints on models of large scale structure follow from combining statistics of the density field with statistics of the velocity field . in this paper , we show how the number of particle pairs depends on pair separation , and use this to compute the mean and mean square pairwise velocity .",
    "that is , we show how the correlation function of the density field and the distribution of pairwise velocities can all be computed from the same model .",
    "the key to being able to do this is a simple model of how and why the correlation function @xmath1 evolves with time .",
    "the evolution of @xmath2 was first accurately modelled by hamilton et al .",
    "( 1991 ) . following peebles ( 1980 )",
    ", they showed that knowledge of how the correlation function evolved allowed them to describe how the mean streaming velocity @xmath3 of particle pairs evolved as well ( also see nityananda & padmanabhan 1994 ) .",
    "peebles suggests that the second moment of the pairwise distribution , @xmath4 depends on ( an integral over ) the three - point correlation function @xmath5 ; because there is no general description of @xmath6 from linear to non - linear scales ( but see scoccimarro & frieman 1998 for scale - free initial conditions ) , there is , at present , no simple description of how the pairwise velocity dispersion depends on scale ( see , e.g. , mo , jing & brner 1997 ; jing , mo & brner 1998 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we will follow a different approach than the one laid down by hamilton et al .",
    "the logic behind our approach follows from the models first discussed by neyman & scott ( 1959 ) , and references therein . in these models ,",
    "all particles are assumed to be in collapsed haloes , and the correlation function of the particles depends on the density profiles as well as on the spatial distribution of the parent haloes . what has changed since those early days",
    "is that we now understand that , for statistics like the correlation function , the most important parameter of a halo is its mass .",
    "following sheth & saslaw ( 1994 ) , sheth & jain ( 1997 ) showed that they were able to provide a good description of the dark matter correlation function on small scales even though they neglected the fact that the parent haloes are clustered .",
    "this works because most close pairs are actually in the same halo , and so the correlation function depends only on the distribution of particles within haloes ( the halo density profile ) and not on the spatial distribution of the other haloes . using formalism presented in mcclelland & silk ( 1977 )",
    ", they showed how to write the correlation function as an integral over haloes having a range of masses .",
    "they then used simple analytic approximations for @xmath7 , the number density of haloes ( the mass function formula of press & schechter 1974 ) , and halo density profiles ( power - laws with slopes chosen to agree with simulations ) , to present their results .",
    "the results of e.g. , scherrer & bertschinger ( 1991 ) , show that one really expects the power - spectrum to be the sum @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the contribution from pairs in different haloes ( i.e. , the term that was neglected by sheth & jain ) .",
    "more recently , seljak ( 2000 ) and peacock & smith ( 2000 ) have extended the model calculation to include these terms .",
    "they used slightly more accurate fitting formulae for the inputs ( the mass function is from sheth & tormen 1999 and the halo profiles are from the work of navarro , frenk and white 1997 ) .",
    "their results show that a good approximation to the evolved @xmath10 on all scales can be got by simply setting @xmath11 , where the first term is that due to the halo profiles and mass function , and the second is the initial power - spectrum evolved to the present time using linear theory .    section  [ modelxi ] of this paper studies the two - point correlation function , @xmath0 , rather than its fourier transform , @xmath10 .",
    "of course , in this case also , @xmath12 , but we feel that explicitly working in real space shows the sorts of approximations which lead to this decomposition more clearly .",
    "it also shows why , both in real and in fourier space , the 2-halo term should approximately equal the linear theory expression .",
    "since this is a model in which the contributions to @xmath0 are written as functions of halo mass , we can study the layzer - irvine cosmic energy equation as a function of halo mass .",
    "we show this in section  [ vrms ] .",
    "our analysis shows which terms in the energy equation come from nonlinear virial motions within each halo , and which from the motions of haloes as a whole which , following sheth & diaferio ( 2000 ) , are more in line with what the linear theory would predict .",
    "we show how our decomposition allows us to provide a simple estimate of the single particle velocity dispersion  which can be thought of as the density weighted temperature .",
    "the requirement of pair conservation provides a relation between the correlation function @xmath0 and the first moment of the pairwise velocity distribution @xmath13 . in section  [ v12 ]",
    "we use our decomposition of @xmath2 to provide a simple expression for the mean streaming velocity , @xmath14 , and then show that this expression describes measurements in simulations quite well .",
    "peebles ( 1980 ) shows that the second moment , @xmath15 , is related to ( an integral over ) the three - point correlation function , @xmath6 .",
    "this relation between the pairwise dispersion and @xmath6 is often called the cosmic virial theorem . since our halo - based approach allows us to model @xmath6 as well ( scoccimarro et al .",
    "2000 ) , we could , in principle , use this to study how @xmath15 depends on pair separation . in section  [ s12 ]",
    "we describe what we think is a much simpler way to think about and model @xmath15 . in our approach ,",
    "the important ingredient is not @xmath6 , but knowledge of how velocities are correlated .",
    "we first show that neglecting these correlations is a rather good approximation : our models of @xmath2 and the single particle velocity dispersion are sufficient for describing the main features of @xmath16 .",
    "we then describe a simple model for including the effects of velocity correlations .",
    "knowledge of both the mean and the dispersion of pairwise velocities are useful for modelling redshift space distortions , which we plan to present elsewhere .",
    "the three velocities we study here , the single particle velocity dispersion @xmath17 , the mean streaming velocity @xmath13 , and the pairwise dispersion @xmath18 may all be used to provide estimates of the density of the universe , although jenkins et al .",
    "( 1998 ) discuss why , in cluster normalized cdm models , different cosmological models may have rather similar values of @xmath14 and @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath19 denote the shape of the density profile of a halo which contains mass @xmath20 ; the mass in a spherical shell at distance @xmath21 from the centre of the halo is @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath23 denote the convolution of such a profile with another of exactly the same shape . for spherically symmetric density profiles",
    "@xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "the contribution to the correlation function from pairs in which both particles are in the same halo is given by weighting the convolution profile of a halo of mass @xmath20 by the number of haloes of mass @xmath20 , and integrating over @xmath20 ( sheth & jain 1997 ) .",
    "the total correlation function is the sum of this plus a term which arises from pairs which are in two different haloes .",
    "this means that the second term is a convolution of the profiles of each of the two haloes involved , with the halo - halo correlation function : @xmath26 suppose that the halo - halo correlation function changes slowly on separations which are large compared to the typical size of a halo .",
    "then , at large @xmath21 , the halo - halo correlation function can be taken outside the integrals , leaving just the convolutions over the profiles . but",
    "these each contribute a factor which equals the mass of the halo , since any position within the halo gives approximately the same pair separation .",
    "this means that @xmath27 at large separations .",
    "to proceed , we need a model for @xmath28 .",
    "this has been done by mo & white ( 1996 ) and sheth & lemson ( 1999 ) . on large scales , mo & white argued that the correlation function of haloes of mass @xmath20 should simply be a constant times the correlation function of the dark matter , @xmath29 , and that the value of the constant should depend on the halo mass .",
    "sheth & tormen ( 1999 ) showed that this dependence on mass can be derived from the shape of the mass function @xmath7 , which , in turn , depends on the initial shape of the power spectrum .",
    "in addition , on large scales , linear theory should apply , and so @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the linear theory correlation function of the dark matter .",
    "thus , for large separations , @xmath32    on small scales the halo - halo correlation function must eventually turn over ( haloes are spatially exclusive ",
    "so each halo is like a small hard sphere ) .",
    "so setting @xmath33 will almost surely overestimate the true value . using the linear , rather than the nonlinear correlation function , even on small scales ,",
    "is a crude but convenient way of accounting for this overestimate .",
    "( although the results of sheth & lemson 1999 allow one to account for this more precisely , it turns out that great accuracy is not really needed since , on small scales , the correlation function is determined almost entirely by the one - halo term anyway . )",
    "if we allow a range in halo masses then the total correlation function is @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the number density of haloes which have mass in the range d@xmath20 about @xmath20 , and @xmath36 is the average density .",
    "the first term dominates on small scales , and the second term dominates on large separations .",
    "now , on large scales @xmath37 is well approximated by the product of @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath31 .",
    "we will not do too badly if we continue to use this approximation on smaller scales because the scales on which it breaks down are precisely those on which the first term begins to dominate .",
    "this means that the second term can be written as the product of two one dimensional integrals",
    ". moreover , the bias factors are defined so that @xmath40 therefore , the second term really is very simple : to a good approximation , @xmath41 note that , in this approximation , the second term is the same for all halo profiles  different profile shapes yield different shapes for @xmath23 and so result in different correlation functions on small scales only ; in principle , one can use measurements of the shape of the correlation function at small separations to constrain the shapes of profiles .    to illustrate how the profile affects the correlation function , in what follows",
    "we will use the nfw profile of navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 ) . in appendix",
    "a we provide expressions for @xmath23 for the nfw profile truncated at the virial radius , the hernquist profile ( 1990 ) , and the singular isothermal sphere , truncated at the virial radius so that it has finite mass .",
    "these three density profiles all have the property that @xmath23 is never less than zero . as a result , @xmath42 is also never less than zero .",
    "this means that the integral of @xmath42 over all separations does not equal zero . as a result ,",
    "equation  ( [ xitotal ] ) above does not satisfy the integral constraint .",
    "this is a formal feature of the models to which we will return later .",
    "the truncated nfw profile above has two free parameters , a core radius and an average density .",
    "navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 ) showed that , in their simulations , the core radius depends on the mass of the halo , whereas all haloes have the same average density , whatever their mass .",
    "they found that the core radii of massive haloes are at larger fractions of their virial radii than for less massive haloes ; less massive haloes are more centrally concentrated .",
    "the ratio of the core radius to the virial radius increases with mass in a way which depends on the shape of the initial power - spectrum  they discuss in detail why this is so . in",
    "what follows , we will use the simple analytic approximation to this relation given in scoccimarro et al .",
    "( 2000 ) as we integrate @xmath23 over the mass function : @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the average mass contained in a tophat filter whose scale is set by the requirement that the rms value of the initial density fluctuation field smoothed with the filter , extrapolated to the present using linear theory , is @xmath45 .",
    "[ xiplot ] shows the correlation functions one obtains by inserting the core - radius relation given above into our expressions for @xmath23 , and integrating over the mass function .",
    "the two panels show two variants of the cdm family of initial conditions : our scdm model has @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , whereas our @xmath49cdm model has @xmath46 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the symbols show the fitting formula of peacock & dodds ( 1996 ) which describes the correlation functions from numerical simulations of these cosmological models well ( see , e.g. , mo , jing & brner 1997 ; jenkins et al .",
    "1998 ) , and the solid curve shows our model using nfw profiles .",
    "the two dashed curves , which sum to give the solid curve , show the two contributions to the correlation function ; the curve which dominates on small scales shows the contribution from pairs in the same halo  the first term in equation  ( [ xir ] ) .",
    "the curve which dominates on large scales shows the contribution from pairs in different haloes .",
    "the dotted curve shows the linear theory correlation function ; on the scales where the two - halo term dominates , the linear theory function provides an excellent approximation .",
    "the model provides a good description of the correlation function of the dark matter .",
    "although we have only presented results for @xmath53 , the model is also accurate at earlier times .",
    "the cosmic energy equation describes how the energy of the universe is partitioned between kinetic and potential energy .",
    "in essence , it provides a relation between the correlation function of dark matter particles and their rms speeds . following hamilton et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , we know how to compute the shape of the correlation function ( i.e. , how it depends on separation @xmath21 ) at any time , if its initial shape is known ( also see nityananda & padmanabhan 1994 ) .",
    "mo , jing & brner ( 1997 ) showed that inserting this evolution into the cosmic energy equation provided a very good description of how the rms velocities of dark matter particles in their simulations evolved .",
    "how much of the evolution of the rms velocity is driven by nonlinear effects within virialized clusters , which produce large velocities , and how much contains information about the ( linearly evolved ) initial conditions ?",
    "we show below that the model described above allows us to separate out the linear from the nonlinear effects .",
    "the cosmic energy equation ( irvine 1961 , 1965 ; layzer 1963 , 1964 ) is an exact statement of what energy conservation means in an expanding universe .",
    "it provides a relation between the potential energy of the system , @xmath54 and the kinetic energy @xmath55 , which is essentially one half times the mean square velocity of the particles in the system .",
    "( note that @xmath56 , where @xmath57 denotes the scale factor of the universe , and not the core radius of the halo profile ! ) if the evolution of @xmath58 is known , then the cosmic energy equation allows one to compute the evolution of @xmath59 also . since we know how @xmath1 evolves , we know how @xmath58 evolves , so we can compute @xmath55 also .",
    "mo , jing & brner ( 1997 ) showed that by combining the hamilton et al .",
    "( 1991 ) evolution of @xmath1 with the cosmic energy equation they were able to compute a good approximation to the value of the single particle velocity dispersion at any given time .",
    "in particular , by integrating the energy equation once , mo et al .",
    "( 1997 ) showed that @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "although this expression is exact , mo et al . also showed that the simpler expression which follows if @xmath62 , as it would in linear theory , is a good approximation : in this case @xmath63    davis , miller & white ( 1997 ) were interested in separating out those contributions to the velocity dispersion which arise from nonlinear effects from those which are given by linear theory .",
    "since we know how to write @xmath1 as a sum of two terms , one from linear theory and the other nonlinear , we can begin to address some of the issues they raised . specifically , suppose we write @xmath64 and we require that it equals the expression for @xmath58 above .",
    "linear theory , extrapolated to the present time , would have @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes the linear correlation function ( e.g. peebles 1980 ) .",
    "however , our model for the nonlinear correlation function is to write @xmath0 as a sum of this linear part , plus a term which depends on halo profiles .",
    "thus , we find that @xmath67 where we have rearranged the order of the integrals so that we do do the one over @xmath21 before integrating over @xmath20 .",
    "the resulting integrals over @xmath21 are computed explicitly in the appendix . in particular , for the halo models of interest in this paper , the haloes are in virial equilibrium : @xmath68 .",
    "thus , in our approach , the ratio of the nonlinear to the linear theory term depends on the mass function and the density profiles of dark matter haloes .",
    "for example , for nfw haloes , @xmath69 equals @xmath70\\,(gm^2/r_{\\rm vir})$ ] times a constant which depends on the ratio of the core radius to the virial radius .",
    "we will not explore this further in this paper . for the time being , we will simply use this expression to estimate how the single particle velocity dispersion evolves .",
    "namely , we will use linear theory extrapolated to the present time to estimate @xmath71 ( see , e.g. , peebles 1980 ) and our models of halo profiles to estimate the other contribution to @xmath72 , and we will then use the energy equation to derive @xmath17 . we will need this single particle @xmath17 later on , when we study how the pairwise velocity dispersion depends on pair separation . for the cdm models presented in this paper , this gives @xmath73km / s and @xmath74 km / s , in good agreement with the values measured in the simulations ( e.g. mo , jing & brner 1997 ; sheth & diaferio 2000 ) . because our models allow us to compute this single particle dispersion at any times , they provide a simple way of computing the evolution of the density weighted temperature of the universe .",
    "the scale dependence of the mean streaming @xmath13 of dark matter particles has been understood for some time now .",
    "hamilton et al .",
    "( 1991 ) showed that because they could provide good estimates of the evolution of @xmath1 , for any initial correlation function , they could also describe the shape of @xmath13 ( also see nityananda & padmanabhan 1994 ) . because the halo model presented in the previous section allows one to compute @xmath1 , by following the steps outlined by hamilton et al .",
    ", it can also be used to compute @xmath13 .",
    "we will not do this here .",
    "rather , we will show that because our halo model allows one to split the correlation function up into linear and nonlinear parts , we are able to compute a good approximation to @xmath13 rather more simply .",
    "recently , juszkiewicz , springel & durrer ( 1999 ) have presented a fitting formula for this statistic ; they argue that their formula is simpler to use than the exact method of hamilton et al .",
    "the results presented in this section can be thought of as providing a simple physical reason for the values of the coefficients in their fitting formula .",
    "the relevant starting point is the pair conservation equation in peebles book ( peebles 1980 ) : @xmath75 , \\label{pairs}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the volume averaged correlation function on comoving scale @xmath77 at the time when the expansion factor is @xmath57 , and the hubble constant is @xmath78 . note that the partial derivative with respect to @xmath57 on the left hand side keeps @xmath79 fixed rather than @xmath21 .",
    "this says that if we know the correlation function for all scales @xmath79 and all times @xmath57 , then we can compute how @xmath13 depends on scale today ; basically it comes from assuming that the number of pairs is conserved .",
    "hamilton et al . also showed that by inserting their expression for the evolution of @xmath1 into equation  ( [ pairs ] ) above , they were able to describe @xmath13 accurately .",
    "a simpler analytic approach follows from reading through peebles logic further .",
    "he notes that an approximate solution to equation  ( [ pairs ] ) can be got by assuming that @xmath80 evolves according to linear theory : @xmath81 ^ 2 \\bar\\xi(r = a_0x , a_0)$ ] , where @xmath82 is the linear theory growth factor .",
    "then the left hand side is @xmath83 , where @xmath84 .",
    "so , in this approximation we get @xmath85 this is just the usual linear theory expression with an extra factor of @xmath86 in the denominator .",
    "juszkiewicz et al .",
    "( 1999 ) show that , while this approximation is fine on large scales , it underestimates the exact solution by a factor of 3/2 or so on smaller scales .",
    "they use perturbation theory to motivate the introduction of the extra terms they must add to this expression to rectify this problem .    our model provides another simple way to see what these terms should be . since the previous section allows us to write @xmath2 as a sum of two terms , we can work out how each one scales with time . in our model , the term which dominates on small scales",
    "evolves both because the mass function evolves , and because the concentrations of haloes of a fixed mass depend on when they formed .",
    "the term which dominates on larger scales is very similar to that predicted by linear theory .",

    "if , in addition , the correlation function was a pure power - law of slope , say , @xmath95 , then @xmath96 . in this case , the term in square brackets in the expression above would become @xmath97 .    to illustrate how the one - halo term scales ,",
    "it is convenient to study a spectrum with shape @xmath98 initially . in this case @xmath99 .",
    "on very small scales , @xmath100 is expected to be a power law of slope @xmath101 ( e.g. peebles 1980 ) .",
    "this makes the right hand side of equation  ( [ v12profile ] ) equal to @xmath102 times @xmath103 .",
    "this is the same as the scaling required by stable clustering ( e.g. hamilton et al . 1991 ) . on intermediate scales ,",
    "padmanabhan ( 1996 ) argues that @xmath80 should be approximately a power - law of slope @xmath104 . if we still set @xmath105 , then the right hand side of equation  ( [ v12profile ] ) becomes @xmath106 times @xmath103 .",

    "@xmath80 has slope @xmath107 , and so the right hand side of equation  ( [ v12profile ] ) becomes @xmath108 , which is the same as the scaling required by linear theory .",

    "another way of saying this is that , if @xmath117 equalled @xmath118 out to the virial radii of all haloes , then the one - halo contribution to the mean streaming velocity would be @xmath119 : this would give a curve which decreased monotonically from unity as @xmath21 increased , whereas our one - halo term actually has a peak at @xmath120mpc@xmath112 . on these slightly larger scales ,",

    "notice that the single - halo contribution to @xmath14 is nonzero even at separations larger than 10mpc@xmath112 , and that it approximately accounts for the overestimate on these scales .",
    "where does this large scale single - halo contribution come from ?",
    "it does not arise from particles which are falling towards each other from opposite sides of a few proud monster haloes ! ( a virialized halo with a radius of 5 mpc@xmath112 would have a mass of about @xmath126 . )",
    "rather , at least some of the overestimate of @xmath14 arises from the fact that , formally , the halo models violate the integral constraint . as mentioned earlier",
    ", the integral of the halo model correlation function over all separations does not equal zero .",
    "this means that the model overpredicts the value of the true @xmath103 .",
    "a glance at fig .  [ xiplot ] shows that @xmath42 on the scale of 5 mpc@xmath112 is negligible .",
    "this in equation  ( [ v12profile ] ) shows that , on these scales , the single - halo contribution to @xmath14 is determined almost entirely by the volume average term , and this results in an overestimate .",
    "one way of remedying this is to make the halo profiles compensated , say , by embedding them in slight underdensities .",
    "this would have the effect of making the large scale value of @xmath42 go slightly negative , with a more dramatic effect on large scale values of the volume average @xmath103 . while compensated profiles may be physically reasonable , and are certainly of formal interest , we have not pursued this further , because the large scales where the spurious streaming velocities appear are also those where the two - halo term dominates the pair statistics .",
    "before we move on to the second moment of the pairwise velocity distribution , we think it is useful to rewrite our expression for the mean streaming motions one final time .",
    "if we use the fact that @xmath127 , then @xmath128\\ , { \\xi_{\\rm 1halo } ( r)\\over 1+\\xi(r ) } , \\label{v12decomp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have omitted writing factors of @xmath57 throughout for brevity , and we have defined @xmath129 $ ] , which can be written entirely in terms of linear theory quantities . the factors @xmath130 $ ] and @xmath131/[1+\\xi]$ ] are simply the fractions of pairs from particles in the same halo , and in separate haloes , respectively .",
    "this form shows clearly that the streaming motions arise from applying linear theory to the pairs in separate haloes , nonlinear theory to the pairs in the same halo , and weighting by the fraction of pairs of each type . for instance , stable clustering would yield unity times the nonlinear pair - weight term , and the quasi - linear scaling described above would yield two times the nonlinear pair - weight term .",
    "it is this sort of decomposition into linear and nonlinear parts which we will exploit in what follows .",
    "this section provides a simple model of how and why the pairwise velocity distribution depends on scale .",
    "the model constructed here is a natural generalization of that studied by sheth ( 1996 ) , diaferio & geller ( 1996 ) , and sheth & diaferio ( 2000 ) .",
    "it is much simpler than the exact ` cosmic virial theorem ' approach ( peebles 1980 ; bartlett & blanchard 1995 ; mo , jing & brner 1997 ) one is led to if one attempts to climb the rungs of the bbgky hierarchy , one - by - one .",
    "let @xmath132 denote the difference between the velocities of two particles separated by @xmath133 , along their line of separation .",
    "if the velocities of the particles separated by @xmath133 are independent of each other , then the shape of this distribution can be computed from knowledge of the shape of the single particle distribution function directly . on small scales ,",
    "this assumption of independence is almost certainly wrong .",
    "however , in the small separation limit , progress can be made by assuming that all pairs at a given small @xmath133 are in the same halo .",
    "since haloes are virialized , particle velocities within a halo are drawn from independent maxwellian distributions , and so velocity differences are also maxwellian , albeit with twice the dispersion of the single particle case .",
    "the dispersion of the maxwellian depends on the mass of the parent halo in which the pair is , and so the full distribution of @xmath132 can be computed by integrating over the distribution of halo masses , weighting by the number of pairs which have separations @xmath133 within each halo of mass @xmath20 .",
    "this model is studied in detail in sheth ( 1996 ) and diaferio & geller ( 1996 ) .",
    "of course , their model only applies on scales where , for most pairs , both members are in the same halo .    what happens at larger separations ?",
    "in this subsection we will study the limit in which both members of the pair are in different haloes .",
    "we will argue that , in this limit , the distribution of @xmath134 is also relatively simple .    as for the correlation function , we begin by writing the dispersion @xmath135 at separation @xmath21 as the sum of two terms : @xmath136 where the first term arises from pairs in which both members are in the same halo ( so it depends on properties of virialized haloes and dominates on small scales ) , and the second term is for pairs in different haloes ( so it dominates on large scales ) .    as mentioned above , the first term depends on the density profiles of virialized haloes .",
    "there are two reasons why it is a function of scale .",
    "first , the velocity dispersion within a halo may depend on position within it , so the pairwise dispersion will depend on separation .",
    "however , the pairwise dispersion will depend on scale even if we neglect this dependence . to see why , note that we should get a reasonable estimate of this term by setting the dispersion equal to the circular velocity at the outside edge of the halo : @xmath137 ( this would be exact for an isothermal sphere , but is only approximate otherwise ) , and using this for all @xmath138 . in this case , @xmath139 this expression is exactly like the one in sheth ( 1996 ) , except that we have multiplied it by an additional factor of @xmath140 $ ] to account for the fact that only a fraction of the pairs at a given separation @xmath21 are in the same @xmath20-halo .    to see that this is the correct pair weighting factor , let @xmath141 denote the probability that there exists a particle in a cell of size @xmath142 within a halo of mass @xmath20 , and another particle in a cell of size @xmath143 which is not necessarily in the same halo .",
    "similarly , let @xmath144 denote the probability that there exists a particle in a cell of size @xmath142 within a halo of mass @xmath20 , and that the other particle in @xmath143 is within the same halo . if each particle carries a mass @xmath145 , then @xmath146\\,{\\rm d}v_2 $ ] , and @xmath147\\,{\\rm d}v_2/m_p$ ] .",
    "the ratio is the fraction of pairs at separation @xmath21 which are both in the same @xmath20-halo : @xmath148 $ ] .",
    "this is the weighting we used in the equation above .",
    "note that this is consistent with equation  ( [ xitotal ] ) : one plus the left hand side of that expression is the total number of pairs at separation @xmath21 , and the first term on the right hand side is the contribution from pairs in which both particles were in the same halo .",
    "it is also the weighting associated with our final expression for the mean streaming motions ( equation  [ v12decomp ] ) .    allowing the dispersion to depend on position in the halo means that @xmath149,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 , and where the one dimensional dispersion , @xmath150 , can be approximated by , say , the radial velocity dispersion given in appendix",

    "therefore the pairwise dispersion will increase with increasing scale at small @xmath21 . on larger scales , however , an increasing fraction of pairs are actually from different haloes .",

    "later in this paper we will develop a model for the velocity correlation function .",
    "for the time being , we think it clearer to study a simpler case first  in what follows , we will neglect the fact that halo velocities may be correlated .    before we do so ,",
    "notice that if haloes were spatially uncorrelated as well , then the pairwise distribution would be the difference of two random variates , so it would be a simple convolution of the single particle distribution derived by sheth & diaferio ( 2000 ) . in what follows",
    ", we will study what happens if we account for the fact that haloes are spatially correlated , even though we neglect the fact that their velocities are also correlated .",
    "suppose we wish to compute the one - dimensional relative pairwise velocity dispersion along the line of separation .",
    "since we are ignoring velocity correlations , the shape of the pairwise velocity distribution arises from applying the appropriate pair - weight as a function of separation , and integrating over the distribution of dispersions given by the halo mass function ( equation  ( [ sig12l ] ) with @xmath164 ) .",
    "the pair - weighting involves the bias factor which depends on halo mass and on the shape of @xmath7 ; since we are using the mass function given in sheth & tormen ( 1999 ) , we will use their formula for @xmath156 also .",
    "let @xmath17 denote the single particle velocity dispersion ( section  [ vrms ] showed that it has contributions from the virial motions within haloes as well as from the motions of the haloes themselves ) .",

    "@xmath170 depends on scale primarily because @xmath0 does . on intermediate scales ( where the assumption that the velocities are independent is certainly wrong ! ) , whether or not @xmath171 increases or decreases with scale depends on the ratio @xmath172 .",
    "for example , the weighting by @xmath173 increases the contribution from massive haloes relative to less massive ones .",
    "since virial motions within massive haloes generate velocities that are larger than the rms , for the dark matter , this ratio is likely to be larger than unity .",

    "although the gif and virgo simulation results are in reasonable agreement on large scales , @xmath175 is larger , by about 100 km / s , on scales smaller than a megaparsec or so .",
    "presumably , this difference arises from the fact that , although the two simulations used the same number of particles , the boxes had different sizes and the particle masses were also different .",
    "the virgo boxes had sides of length @xmath176mpc@xmath112 , the gif @xmath49cdm box was 141 mpc@xmath112 .",
    "the finite box size has two effects : first , large scale flows have smaller amplitudes in small boxes , and so this affects the large - scale value of the pairwise dispersion .",
    "in addition , small boxes do not have a fair sample of the massive haloes which dominate the pairwise velocity statistic at a megaparsec . because massive haloes are rare",
    ", the pairwise statistic will have a large scatter ; the large value of @xmath16 we measured in the smaller gif simulation may simply be a large fluctuation .",
    "on the other hand , because of its better mass resolution , the gif box is able to resolve substructure within virialized haloes which the virgo simulations can not .",
    "the presence of substructure will increase the velocity dispersion .",

    "discrepancies between the model and simulations are not caused by our neglect of the halo velocity correlation function ; this regime is dominated by pairs which are in the same halo , which suggests that it is the assumption that the pairwise dispersion within haloes is isotropic and independent of position within the halo , as it would for an isothermal sphere , which should be changed .",
    "if one is willing to assume the orbits within the halo are isotropic , then this can be done by using the expressions for the radial velocity dispersion we provide in appendix  a. we will show the results of doing this in the next subsection .    on large scales , the difference between the symbols and the solid curve is a measure of the importance of velocity correlations .",

    "this subsection shows how one might include the effects of correlated velocities . to do so",

    "in such a model , virial motions are random : the virial velocity of a particle is not correlated with the motion of the other particles in the halo , nor with the value of @xmath182 , nor with the motion of any other particle in any other halo .",
    "this means that correlated motions arise because halo motions may be correlated , and not otherwise .",
    "if the virial velocity is independent of pair separation @xmath21 , then @xmath163 in equation  ( [ shalor ] ) represents the correlations of halo motions for @xmath158 and @xmath159-haloes separated by @xmath21 . strictly speaking",

    "the dashed curves in the two upper panels of fig .  [ gals ] show our model predictions when this relation is used .",
    "the correlation functions of the two semi - analytic models are similar despite the different brightness cuts .",
    "however , because this model has fewer galaxies in massive haloes than the kauffmann et al .",
    "model , the pairwise dispersion of the galaxies in this model is lower .",
    "this is because , compared to the correlation function , the pairwise dispersion has an extra @xmath229 dependence on halo mass , so it is that much more sensitive to the presence or absence of massive haloes .",
    "the benson et al .",
    "models for galaxies with @xmath230 are well fit by @xmath231 .",
    "if we use this relation instead , then the amplitude of @xmath16 increases .",
    "this is consistent with what benson et al .",
    "measured in their simulations .",
    "writing the correlation function as the sum of two terms , one which is essentially described by linear theory , and dominates on large scales , and another which is inherently nonlinear , and dominates on small scales , is both accurate and useful .",
    "such a split has been used to model the spatial distribution of the dark matter and of galaxies ( seljak 2000 ; peacock & smith 2000 ; scoccimarro et al .",
    "sheth & diaferio ( 2000 ) show that a similar split can be applied to velocities ; particle velocities can also be written as the sum of linear and nonlinear parts . in this paper",
    ", we used this split to compute simple estimates not just of the correlation function of dark matter particles , but of the single particle velocity dispersion ( the density weighted temperature ) and its evolution , and the scale dependence of the first and second moments of the pairwise velocity distribution as well .    our model provides a good description of the scale dependence of the mean streaming velocities ( figs .",
    "[ v12plot ] and  [ v12hr ] ) .",
    "it also provides a reasonably good description of the scale dependence of the pairwise dispersion , provided one restricts attention to scales larger than a megaparsec or so ( figs .",
    "[ sig12 ] and  [ sig12c ] ) ; our model appears to underestimate the value of @xmath16 on scales smaller than 1 mpc@xmath112 .",
    "this is , perhaps , surprising , because on these smaller scales , most pairs are in the same halo , and one might have thought that virialized haloes were rather simple to model .",
    "our model assumes that virialized haloes are smooth ( or , more importantly , that substructure does not substantially affect the velocity dispersion ) , and that the velocity dispersion within them is isotropic .",
    "the discrepancy between our model and the simulations suggests that one or both of these assumptions is wrong . to model the small separation regime accurately",
    ", we may have to resort to using the exact approach based on the bbgky hierarchy ( e.g. peebles 1980 ) . as we mentioned in the introduction , this approach is considerably more complicated , because it requires knowledge of the three - point correlation function .",
    "although this can be done within the context of these halo models using results presented in scoccimarro et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we have not done so here .    despite the shortcomings of our model for the pairwise dispersion on small scales ,",
    "we feel that there are at least two reasons why it is useful .",
    "first , it is much simpler than the exact approach one is led to from the bbgky hierarchy , for which knowledge of the three - point correlation function is required .",
    "secondly , it is easily extended to provide predictions as a function of trace particle type .",
    "this is particularly useful for comparing theoretical models with observations of galaxies .",
    "section  [ types ] showed how to model the dependence on separation of the galaxy pairwise velocity dispersion .",
    "the main reason for doing this was the following . our model for the linear and nonlinear contributions to the number of pairs at a given separation",
    "can be combined with sheth & diaferio s model for the linear and nonlinear contributions to velocities , to model how the full distribution of pairwise velocities ( not just the first and second moments ) depend on pair separation .",
    "such a model can be extended to describe galaxies , just as we did here .",
    "following fisher ( 1995 ) , this allows us to estimate the effect of redshift space distortions on the shape of the galaxy correlation function over the entire range of linear to nonlinear scales .",
