    "some natural biological tissues such as articular cartilage possess an inhomogeneous , layered structure with anisotropic material properties . in particular ,",
    "morphological studies of adult articular cartilage @xcite show three different zones of preferred collagen fiber bundle orientation .",
    "the superficial zone formed by tangentially oriented collagen fibrils provides a thin layer with a high tensile stiffness in the direction parallel to articular surface .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the high transverse stiffness of the superficial tissue layer ( characterized by tangentially oriented collagen fibrils ) is important in controlling the deformation response of articular cartilage .",
    "generally speaking , the surface layer in biomaterials usually has different mechanical properties than the underlying bulk material . due to this circumstance ,",
    "the mechanical deformation behavior is strongly influenced by the complex interaction of these layers @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we consider the deformation problem for a transversely isotropic elastic layer reinforced with a thin elastic membrane ideally attached to one surface , while the other surface is bonded to a rigid substrate .",
    "following @xcite , it is assumed that the reinforcing layer is very thin ( with respect to a characteristic size of the applied load ) so that its deformation can be treated in the framework of the generalized plane stress state .",
    "moreover , it is assumed that the flexural stiffness of the coating layer is negligible compared to its tensile stiffness .",
    "thus , the reinforcing thin layer is regarded as an elastic membrane .",

    ".    it can be shown ( see , in particular , @xcite ) that the leading - order term in ( [ 44ch(4.24 ) ] ) is given by @xmath66 whereas the first non - trivial term of the expansion ( [ 44ch(4.23 ) ] ) satisfies the problem @xmath67 @xmath68    substituting the expansion ( [ 44ch(4.25 ) ] ) for @xmath69 into the above equations , we obtain @xmath70    the solution to the boundary - value problem ( [ 44ch(4.26 ) ] ) is represented in the form @xmath71 where @xmath72 satisfies the equation @xmath73 on the entire plane @xmath74 .",

    "in other words , the deformation of the elastic coating does not contribute substantially to the deformation of a thin compressible layer .",
    "when the layer material approaches the incompressible limit , the right - hand side of ( [ 44ch(4.s1 ) ] ) decreases to zero and the first term in the asymptotic expansion ( [ 44ch(4.24 ) ] ) disappears . at that , based on the known results @xcite , it can be shown that the ratios @xmath92 and @xmath93 tend to 1 and 0 , respectively .    therefore , in the incompressible limit situation formula ( [ 44ch(4.33 ) ] ) reduces to @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the out - of - plane shear modulus of the elastic layer , while @xmath72 satisfies the equation @xmath96    thus , in the case of incompressible bonded elastic layer , formulas ( [ 44ch(4.2l)])([44ch(4.24 ) ] ) , ( [ 44ch(4.s2 ) ] ) , and ( [ 44ch(4.s3 ) ] ) give @xmath97 where the vector @xmath98 solves the equation @xmath99    observe that in view of ( [ 44ch(4.28 ) ] ) , the vector - function @xmath98 has the meaning of the tangential displacement of the surface point @xmath100 of the elastic layer .",
    "recall also that the matrix differential operator @xmath44 is defined by formulas ( [ 44ch(4.14l ) ] ) .",
    "observe that in the axisymmetric case ( in view of ( [ 44ch(4.13 ) ] ) ) , we have @xmath101 where @xmath102 while eqs .  ( [ 44ch(4.7 ) ] ) should be replaced with the following one : @xmath103    correspondingly , the boundary condition ( [ 44ch(4.14 ) ] ) takes the following form : @xmath104    it is to note here that the axisymmetric boundary condition ( [ 44ch(4.15 ) ] ) was previously derived in a number of papers @xcite .",

    "( [ 44ch(4.s5 ) ] ) implies @xmath106 the substitution of this expression into formula ( [ 44ch(4.s4 ) ] ) gives @xmath107 which completely agrees with the asymptotic model developed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "second , in the case of very stiff ( inextensible ) coating we will have @xmath108 , and formula ( [ 44ch(4.s4 ) ] ) reduces to @xmath109 in other words , comparing ( [ 44ch(4.s6 ) ] ) and ( [ 44ch(4.s7 ) ] ) , we conclude that the inextensible membrane coating attached to the surface of a thin incompressible elastic layer reduces the out - of - plane shear compliance of the bonded layer by four times .",
    "the main result of the paper , presented in section  [ sec:44.1.3 ] , is the leading - order asymptotic formulas for the normal displacement ( called the local indentation ) of the surface points for compressible and incompressible thin bonded elastic layers reinforced with an elastic membrane .",
