    "<S> , it depends on whether we order all indices according to the ordering of the _ legs _ on the diagram , or according to the ordering of the _ places _ on which the legs reside , i.e.  when the two legs are exchanged , the corresponding indices are either exchanged or stay at their places ( see e.g.  eq .  ) .    </S>",
