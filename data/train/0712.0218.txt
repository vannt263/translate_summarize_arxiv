    "sagittarius b2 ( sgr  b2 ) ( g0.7 - 0.0 ) is a very massive and well - studied molecular cloud complex near the centre of the galaxy .",
    "it contains multiple centres of ( in many cases ) spectacular star formation activity .",
    "the name derives from low resolution radio observations where sagittarius a is the strong source at the galactic centre proper @xcite and b1 , b2 , c , d and e refer to other radio and mid - ir features nearby @xcite , albeit with some confusion in the literature @xcite .",
    "sgr b2 is about 100 pc in projected distance from the galactic centre and we assume its distance from the sun to be identical to the latter s , @xmath6 .",
    "an @xmath6 of @xmath7 kpc was measured by @xcite using a kinematic parallax method .",
    "a more precise distance is the ` best - estimate ' value of @xmath8 kpc that @xcite derived by combining this with other data for the galactic centre .",
    "the latter is corroborated by the value of @xmath9 kpc that has recently been determined from orbital solutions of a star moving around the super - massive central black hole , sgr a@xmath10 @xcite . in the following we assume @xmath11 kpc .",
    "sgr b2 presents itself as the strongest feature in images of emission in @xmath12co , @xmath13co @xcite and cs @xcite that define the bar - shaped @xcite central molecular zone ( cmz ) , which stretches over the central few hundred pc of the galaxy .",
    "the total mass of sgr b2 is @xmath14 m@xmath15 and its peak h@xmath16 column density @xmath17 @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "recent star formation is indicated by a giant h  ii region @xcite , with many compact and ultra - compact h  ii regions @xcite .",
    "there are multiple centres of maser emission from the water @xcite , hydroxyl @xcite and formaldehyde @xcite molecules , as well as class i and class ii methanol masers @xcite .",
    "the region s huge far - ir luminosity requires several young o - type stars as power sources , which are deeply embedded in the molecular cores .",
    "the star - forming centres are located in a north - south line about 2 arcmin ( @xmath19  5 pc ) long , in components labelled ( north to south ) sgr  b2(n ) , sgr  b2(m ) and sgr  b2(s ) .",
    "all have prominent radio h  ii free - free , millimetre and sub - millimetre @xcite and infrared @xcite emission .",
    "these cores have been extensively studied with millimetre spectral - line surveys @xcite .",
    "sgr  b2(n ) is particularly rich in complex molecules : it has been called the ` large molecule heimat ' @xcite or lmh .",
    "sgr  b2(n ) is considered to be in a more recent stage of star formation than sgr  b2(m ) @xcite , due to the presence of the complex molecules , stronger h@xmath16o masers , and the relatively large amount of dust .",
    "the surrounding molecular cloud has complex kinematics .",
    "the densest core emits around 6065 km  s@xmath1 , but there is a ` hole ' in the co and cs emission around 4050 km  s@xmath1 in this area @xcite .",
    "this has been attributed @xcite to a collision between the 4050 km  s@xmath1 cloud and a cloud at 7080 km  s@xmath1 , triggering the star formation activity .",
    "there is also a cloud 2 arcmin north of sgr b2(m ) , and 1 arcmin north of sgr b2(n ) , with chemical enhancement in hnco and hoco@xmath20 @xcite , which may be associated with the shock from this collision .",
    "we present here a multi - line spectral study in the 3-mm band , of the central 12 pc of the sgr  b2 complex , to probe the chemistry and kinematics with a wide range of molecular tracers .",
    "the data were obtained with a new 8 ghz wide spectrometer on the mopra millimetre wave telescope in australia .",
    "these are the initial results of a project to map the cmz in a variety of molecular species emitting in the 3-mm band .",
    "the observations were made with the 22-m mopra radio telescope , in on - the - fly mapping mode @xcite .    during 2005 a new wide - bandwidth digital filterbank , mops , was installed .",
    "this takes advantage of the wide bandwidth of the mmic receiver , also installed in 2005 , which covers the range from 77 to 117 ghz and has a wide front - end bandwidth .",
    "the mops can cover 8 ghz of bandwidth simultaneously , in either a broad band mode covering the whole band in four 2.2 ghz wide spectra , or a zoom mode where several narrower spectral bands of 137 mhz can be selected within the overall 8 ghz . in both the broad band and",
    "zoom modes , two polarisations are detected .",
    "the observations made in 2006 june had 1024 channels in each 2.2 ghz in the broad band mode giving channel width 2.15 mhz or around 6.4 km  s@xmath1 ( at 100 ghz ) .",
    "this is coarser velocity sampling than desirable , but does allow the whole 8 ghz spectrum to be covered for a single tuning , and most of the 3-mm band in 4 tunings .",
    "the narrow band mode allowed a maximum of 8 zoom spectra of 137 mhz with 4096 channels ( 0.033 mhz or 0.10 km  s@xmath1 at 100 ghz ) to be observed ( with a maximum of 4 zooms in each 2.2 ghz section ) or 8 lines to be selected at high spectral resolution within the 8 ghz band covered by a single tuning .",
    "this period was while the mops was still being upgraded , and the performance has since improved to allow up to 8192 channels of 0.27 mhz for each 2.2 ghz window in the broad band mode and up to 16 zoom spectra simultaneously .",
    "further observations in this mopra cmz mapping project in 2007 and onwards use this increased performance .",
    "the on - the - fly ( otf ) observations covered an area @xmath21 arcmin@xmath22 centred on ( @xmath23@xmath24@xmath25 , i.e. , close to sagittarius b2(n ) .",
    "we observed this area in both the broad band and zoom modes , in several tunings , as summarised in table [ obs_log ] .",
    "the broad band ranges are calculated assuming an overall range of 8 ghz : the data cover a bit more spectral range with 2.2 ghz sub - band spectra separated by 2.0 ghz , but are poor at the sub - band edges .",
    "the otf observations were made in a similar mode as for the mopra g333 - 0.5/rcw106 survey @xcite .",
    "we used position switching for bandpass calibration with an off - source reference position ( ( @xmath26@xmath24@xmath27 , or @xmath28 deg .",
    ", @xmath29 deg .",
    "observed before each 5 arcmin long source scan .",
    "the spectra were read out with 2 seconds of integration time .",
    "the scan lines were separated by about 10 arcsec , so around 30 scan lines were needed , taking around an hour in total .",
    "observations of sio maser positions were used to correct the telescope pointing , before every map , giving a pointing accuracy better than 10 arcsec .",
    "the system temperature was calibrated with a noise diode , and hot load ( paddle ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ peak_summary ]    we also show in figure [ radio_ir ] the 20-cm radio , from the vla , the 850-@xmath30 sub - mm from scuba , and 21-@xmath30 mid - ir , from msx .",
    "we point out that , for the many molecules here that peak in the ridge - line to the west of the sgr b2(n ) and sgr b2(m ) cores , this distribution of molecular emission ` wraps around ' the north and west side , where there is little radio and mid - ir emission tracing recent star formation , and avoids the south - east area where there is recent star formation .",
    "the north cloud , in particular , is quite isolated from the recent star formation activity .",
    "in contrast , the scuba sub - mm emission , tracing cooler dust than the mid - ir , shows extended emission around the sgr b2(n ) and sgr b2(m ) cores , to the north and west which matches well the north cloud and the molecular ridge - line .    each line that we have imaged here",
    "has its own particular distribution , corresponding to the spatial distribution of the molecule , and the effect of the excitation of the different levels .",
    "there is also a complicated velocity structure in the region .",
    "however , we can make some generalisations and comments here to bring some order to the overall results .",
    "the co ( @xmath13co , c@xmath3o and c@xmath31o ) shows that the densest region is around sgr  b2(m ) at velocity 63 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath13co is optically thick at this core , so the density there is better traced by the c@xmath3o",
    ". the column density , would be further concentrated at sgr  b2(n ) and sgr  b2(m ) , than the c@xmath3o 1    0 integrated line emission shown here .",
    "the higher temperature at the cores ( @xmath19 200 k , compared to @xmath19  20 k for the surrounding gas ) leads to an extra factor there , when converting , with the standard lte analysis , from integrated line emission to total co column density , and hence total h@xmath16 column density .",
    "the hco@xmath4 , hcn and hnc are strong and widespread with absorption at the sgr  b2(m ) and sgr  b2(n ) cores .",
    "the column density is likely to be peaked at these cores , but the integrated emission is strongly affected by this absorption , leading to local minima in the emission intensity at the cores .",
    "there are differences in the detailed distribution of these three lines , as expected : hcn should be a good tracer of high gas density ( @xmath32 @xmath33 ) , the isomer hnc should trace cool quiescent gas , and the ion hco@xmath4 should trace ionisation due to cosmic rays .",
    "we have further mopra data of these lines over a larger area , from broad - band observations over the 85.3 to 93.3 ghz range , which show the differences more clearly , so we postpone further discussion for a later paper .",
    "the cs and sio distributions are also affected by absorption at the sgr  b2(m ) and sgr  b2(n ) cores , so the column density distribution is hard to determine from the integrated emission images .",
    "cs is expected to be , like hcn , a good tracer of high density gas , and sio is expected to trace shocks , but is quite widespread here .",
    "the cn emission is quite uniform over the @xmath21  arcmin area observed here , except for the absorption at the sgr  b2(m ) and sgr  b2(n ) cores .",
    "it is expected to be associated with an enhanced ultraviolet ( uv ) field , so this would indicate a widespread uv field in the sgr b2 complex .",
    "the weak lines of c@xmath16h and c - c@xmath5h@xmath16 also have absorption at the sgr  b2(m ) and sgr  b2(n ) cores and widespread emission , but some excess emission on the ridge - line west of the cores .",
    "most of the lines imaged here trace the ridge - line west of the sgr  b2(m ) , sgr  b2(n ) and sgr  b2(s ) cores , and north - east to what we are calling the north cloud .",
    "these lines include hc@xmath5n , ch@xmath5cn , ch@xmath5oh , hnco , ocs , n@xmath16h@xmath4 , ch@xmath5cch , nh@xmath16cho / h@xmath16coh@xmath4 , nh@xmath16cn , ch@xmath16nh and h@xmath16cs . these more complex molecules , as noted above , trace the cooler dust seen at sub - mm wavelengths , and avoid the areas with the warmer dust ( mid - ir ) and radio continuum associated with the active star formation",
    ". n@xmath16h@xmath4 and the 96.74 ghz transition of ch@xmath5oh are strong , and also show some absorption at the sgr  b2(m ) and sgr  b2(n ) cores .    the relative prominence of the peaks in the ridge - line west of the sgr  b2(m ) , sgr  b2(n ) and sgr",
    "b2(s ) cores in these different molecules , and between different transitions of the same molecule ( e.g.ch@xmath5oh ) , indicate differences in chemistry and excitation conditions .",
    "the lines of hnco and hoco@xmath4 highlight the north cloud , and are tracers of shock chemistry .",
    "the lines of so and so@xmath16 are also tracers of shocks , and are concentrated at sgr  b2(m ) , although the lower excitation 99.30 ghz so line also traces the more extended gas in the north cloud and ridge to the west .",
    "we have undertaken a 3-mm spectral - line imaging survey of the sgr  b2 area , of 5 arcmin square , with the mopra telescope , at resolution @xmath19 36  arcsec .",
    "we covered almost the complete spectral the range 81.7 to 113.5 ghz , with 2.2 mhz or @xmath0  km  s@xmath1 spectral channels , and have observed 24 lines , with 0.033 mhz , or @xmath2  km  s@xmath1 channels .",
    "we have discussed the distribution of around 50 lines , and presented integrated emission images for 38 of the lines . in addition , we have detected around 120 more lines , mostly concentrated at sgr  b2(n ) .    by fitting the peak position and velocity of the emission in the various lines",
    ", we find that there are seven distinct molecular features in the region , which show distinct differences in both molecular abundances and excitation conditions .",
    "the mopra telescope is funded by the commonwealth of australia as a national facility managed by csiro as part of the australia telescope .",
    "the unsw mops digital filterbank was provided with funding from the australian research council , university of new south wales , sydney university , macquarie university and the csiro atnf .",
