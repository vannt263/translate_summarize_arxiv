    "since the region @xmath311 varies continuously with @xmath30 , we can compute the derivative @xmath309 by an appropriate line integral around the boundary of @xmath311 .",
    "indeed , by the fundamental theorem of calculus , we have @xmath312 where we have used the symmetry @xmath313 to reduce the integral to just the top and bottom edges of @xmath311 ( where @xmath314 and @xmath315 , respectively ) .      for this range of @xmath30 , the line @xmath318 intersects the bottom edge of @xmath311 at @xmath319 , while the hyperbola @xmath320 intersects the top edge at @xmath321 .",
    "thus by the definition of @xmath275 , equation   becomes @xmath322    the following elementary antiderivatives , which are readily obtained by substitution and integration by parts , follow for any fixed nonzero real number  @xmath154 from the definitions  ,  , and   of @xmath323 , @xmath324 , and @xmath325 : @xmath326 therefore in this case @xmath327 ( after some algebraic simplification ) , which verifies the first case of theorem  [ theorem : distribution of real eigenvalues ] .",
    "( note that the integrands really are continuous , despite terms that look like @xmath328 , because the function @xmath323 is continuous at  0 ; hence evaluating the integrals by antiderivatives is valid . )    now , the line @xmath318 does not intersect @xmath311 , while the hyperbola @xmath320 intersects the top edge at @xmath321 .",
    "thus by the definition of @xmath275 and the antiderivative   of @xmath325 , equation   becomes @xmath329 which verifies the second case of theorem  [ theorem : distribution of real eigenvalues ] .",
    "as before , the line @xmath318 does not intersect @xmath311 , while the hyperbola @xmath320 intersects the bottom edge at @xmath330 . thus by the definition of @xmath275 and the antiderivative   of @xmath325 , equation   becomes @xmath331 which verifies the third case of theorem  [ theorem : distribution of real eigenvalues ] .",
    "one could also use the same method to extract the individual distributions of the greater and lesser eigenvalues of @xmath42 : for instance , eliminating the factor of 2 from equation   would yield an expression for the distribution of just the lesser eigenvalue of  @xmath42 ."
