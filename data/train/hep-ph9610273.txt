    "the simplest model of breaking the electroweak gauge symmetry @xmath0 spontaneously is the standard higgs model .",

    "the standard higgs model is regarded to be an effective theory , only valid up to a cutoff energy @xmath1 .",
    "the maximal allowed value of @xmath1 depends on the higgs value of the higgs mass @xmath2 , and it is connected to the renormalization group ( rg ) behaviour of the higgs sector .    in the absence of a more complete theory ,",
    "it is important to understand the perturbative limitations of the standard higgs model : if @xmath2 is too large , perturbation theory ceases to be a useful tool for calculating physical observables of the higgs sector , such as cross sections and higgs decay width .",

    "( [ lagrhiggs ] ) , the @xmath15 and @xmath16 bosons are massless , in agreement with the goldstone theorem @xcite .",

    "the lagrangian @xmath22 corresponds to taking the limit of vanishing gauge and yukawa couplings of the full standard model lagrangian , and it is the starting point for carrying out calculations using the equivalence theorem @xcite . the equivalence theorem can also be used to calculate radiative corrections without having to use the full sm lagrangian @xcite , but the use of proper renormalization conditions is crucial @xcite .",

    "one calculates perturbative amplitudes , assuming small perturbative couplings . increasing @xmath37 , the perturbative expansion will eventually break down , giving upper perturbative bounds on the ( running ) higgs coupling .",
    "one has to distinguish two different kinds of physical observables .",
    "low - energy quantities such as higgs decay amplitudes do not require rg methods , hence no running coupling is involved .",
    "therefore they immediately yield an upper perturbative bound on @xmath2 via eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "cross sections with large center - of - mass energy , @xmath38 , do require the use of the running coupling .",
    "hence the onset of nonperturbative effects in such processes is a function of both @xmath2 and @xmath39 .",
    "there are several criteria we can use to judge the convergence of perturbation theory :    * the size of radiative corrections should be small , with higher order contributions being suppressed .",
    "* the renormalization scheme dependence ( _ e.g. , _ @xmath40 _ vs.",
    "_ oms ) of physical amplitudes should diminish when including higher order corrections . *",
    "the dependence of an amplitude on the scale @xmath24 should decrease with increasing order in perturbation theory . *",
    "scattering amplitudes should not violate perturbative unitarity by a large amount .    _",
    "exact _ amplitudes , of course , have _ no _ scheme dependence , _ no _ scale dependence , and feature _ no _ unitarity violations . converging perturbative amplitudes should therefore approach this limit reasonably fast .",
    "yet there are also limitations to nonperturbative calculations in the sm higgs sector .",
    "since the heavy - higgs running coupling has a positive beta function even in the nonperturbative approach @xcite , there remains a cutoff scale @xmath1 beyond which the theory fails . in return , this cutoff scale bounds the possible higgs mass range from above .",

    "a heavy higgs particle ( @xmath41 ) decays mostly into pairs of ( longitudinally polarized ) gauge bosons .",

    "have been calculated .",
    "using the oms renormalization scheme , the bosonic decay channel receives corrections@xcite @xmath43 and the two - loop result for the fermionic decay width is @xcite @xmath44 comparing the magnitude of the one - loop and two - loop corrections , perturbation theory seems to work up to values of @xmath45 , that is , higgs masses of about 1 tev .",
    "however , conversion of the results into the @xmath40 scheme as well as an analysis of the scale dependence using rg methods reveals that higher - order terms may spoil perturbation theory already for values of @xmath46 , or equivalently , @xmath47 gev @xcite .",
    "the principles of such analyses will be discussed in the following section in connection with cross sections rather than decay widths .",
    "a typical scattering process related to the sm higgs sector is @xmath48 .",
    "this process is of interest for future colliders such as the lhc or linear @xmath49 and @xmath50 colliders . at tree level ,",
    "the amplitude consists of a gauge contribution @xmath51 and a higgs sector contribution @xmath52 .",
    "the @xmath52 term is connected to the longitudinally polarized component of the gauge bosons .",

    "= 2.5 in    at high center - of - mass energy , @xmath38 , the three - point interactions contributing to the amplitude @xmath54 are suppressed by powers of @xmath55 : @xmath56 this is also true when including higher order corrections , as can be shown using dimensional arguments .",
    "hence the entire high - energy @xmath57-dependence originates from scattering graphs related to @xmath58 , the part of the higgs lagrangian which is identical to a massless @xmath59 theory with n=4 .",

    "choosing , for example , @xmath75 to be about 2 tev , the higgs mass has to be less than about 400 gev to allow for a perturbative calculation of the cross section .",
    "recent results @xcite , however , show that this bound can be relaxed ; see the following section .",
    "the perturbative behaviour of the scattering cross sections can be improved by performing a partial summation of higher - order contributions @xcite . realizing that chains of bubble diagrams , @xmath76 , and diagrams with bubble substructures ( see fig .  [ feyn2lp ] for examples up to two loops ) are the dominant contribution to the @xmath57-dependent part of the scattering amplitude , a class of nonlogarithmic terms accompanying the logarithmic @xmath57-dependent terms can be partially summed .",
    "this summation can be formulated in terms of a modified scale entering the running coupling .",
    "instead of using the standard choice @xmath68 , the improved choice is @xcite @xmath77 the vast improvement due to this choice can be seen when plotting the scale dependence of the cross section . in fig .",
    "[ figsigmu ] the quantity @xmath66 is given as a function of @xmath78 , fixing the running coupling at @xmath79 to be 1.5 ( which corresponds to @xmath80 ) .",
    "= 2.5 in    taking @xmath68 , the cross section receives large radiative corrections and has a strong scale dependence . in particular , the scale dependence remains large even when performing a nnll resummation .",
    "in contrast , the improved scale @xmath79 leads to much smaller corrections , and the scale dependence almost vanishes when going beyond the ll approximation .",
    "of course , increasing the value of the running coupling , perturbation theory also breaks down for the summed cross section .",
    "this happens for @xmath81 of about 4.0 , where perturbative unitarity is violated @xcite .",
    "such a running couplings corresponds to , for example , @xmath82 gev and @xmath75 close to 2 tev .",
    "experimental measurement of the higgs quartic coupling ( for example , the measurement of the @xmath52 contribution to high - energy @xmath83 scattering ) and verifying its theoretical prediction is challenging . for small values of @xmath17 , the electroweak @xmath51 terms are dominant .",
    "larger values of @xmath17 increase the @xmath52 contributions of the cross sections ( see fig .",
    "[ figsigall ] ) , but accumulation of a sufficient amount of data and elimination of background is a difficult task .",
    "the perturbative upper bounds on the higgs ( running ) coupling indicate that perturbation theory is reliable for higgs masses up to 700 gev if the process considered has a center - of - mass energy of less than 2 tev . going to higher cms energy , the value of @xmath2 has to be reduced to satisfy @xmath84 . of course ,",
    "these bounds are process dependent .",
    "however , all @xmath85 high - energy scattering processes involving @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath9 particles are related by the underlying so(4 ) symmetry of @xmath58 and therefore have similar amplitudes .",
    "in particular the unitarity argument , first used by @xcite , involves the different channels and supports the above bound .",
    "the perturbative upper bounds can be compared with results obtained from lattice calculations @xcite .",
    "such results depend somewhat on the lattice action and regularization used .",
    "interestingly , they obtain similar bounds on the higgs mass , excluding the existence of a heavier standard model higgs boson .",
