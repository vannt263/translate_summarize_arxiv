    "the notion of quantum entanglement is closely connected to the tensor product structure of a state space of composite quantum systems . for some types of composite systems that lack this structure , entanglement is no longer uniquely defined .",
    "this happens for systems of indistinguishable particles , in which symmetrization or anti - symmetrization of the wave function imposes some sort of `` default '' entanglement . as an elementary example of this , consider two identical bosons which occupy two quantum states , for example atomic levels denoted @xmath1 and @xmath2 of an atom .",
    "as they are indistinguishable bosons , it is appropriate to use the second quantized notation to write the quantum state as @xmath3 where @xmath4 are bosonic annihilation operators of the states . this does not have the appearance of possessing any entanglement .",
    "in first quantized notation , one would however write @xmath5 which has the appearance of an entangled state .",
    "the amount of entanglement in such systems that is operationally accessible is difficult to define and has been a subject of a long debate .",
    "initially the debate was motivated by the problem of nonclassical properties of a two - mode single photon field @xcite .",
    "later many propositions for defining entanglement of indistinguishable particles were proposed @xcite , which were concluded by showing , that only a part of entanglement coming from symmetrization can be operationally extracted @xcite .",
    "recently more efficient way of extracting this kind of entanglement was proposed by a method called _ mode splitting _ @xcite .",
    "understanding entanglement in indistinguishable systems is important to understand not only from a fundamental perspective , but increasingly in the context of technological applications .",
    "the resource capabilities in quantum optical systems has been a topic of long - standing investigation , due to their highly coherent properties making them a natural candidate for quantum information tasks @xcite .",
    "recent experimental advances in coherent control of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) have opened the door for utilizing these systems for tasks such as quantum metrology @xcite , interferometry @xcite , quantum simulation @xcite , and quantum computing @xcite . in particular",
    ", the ability of realizing becs on atom chips allows for the possibility of excellent coherent control @xcite , and performing tasks such as spin squeezing @xcite .",
    "this allows for a naturally scalable architecture where multiple becs could be produced on the same chip , allowing for the possibility of entanglement between becs @xcite .",
    "while entanglement between two bec has not been realized to date , entanglement between a bec and an atom has been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "while entanglement criteria for optical systems has been relatively well - studied @xcite , the analogous case for becs has not been performed to the same level @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider a hybrid scenario , in which two systems of bosons constitute two physically distinguishable components . for simplicity",
    "we assume that both components contain the same fixed number @xmath6 of indistinguishable particles , which can be prepared in two different modes .",
    "in such a physical system , bipartite entanglement between the two components is well defined , and can be experimentally detected and used as a resource .",
    "the main goal of our paper is to present correlation - based criteria for detection of this kind of entanglement .",
    "a correlation based approach @xcite is desirable from an experimental point of view as they are most closely related to measured observables .",
    "however it can not be directly applied to the case of multi - boson states , because it involves measurements performed on single localized particles . in order to extend applicability of correlation - based entanglement detetection to multiboson systems , we define the measurement basis for the two components , which enables us to treat the entire system as two effective @xmath7+@xmath8-level systems . having defined the basis we apply quadratic correlation tensor criterion from @xcite , which allows for the efficient detection of bipartite entanglement between the two components .",
    "note that the above method of probing entanglement utilizes the entire structure of subsystems that can be defined within the components .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that using this entire structure is a necessary condition for detecting entanglement ",
    "the compound observables with higher - dimensional eigenspaces ( e.g. total angular momentum observables ) lead to weaker and unsatisfactory conditions . despite its simplicity ,",
    "the model presented in this paper can be used to characterize entanglement in two experimentally significant physical systems : entangled spinor bose - einstein condensates @xcite and non - classical light created during spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) @xcite .",
    "we choose our examples based on realistic methods that could be used to generate entanglement in becs and optical systems , which provide a test - bed for examining macroscopic entanglement @xcite .",

    "the states within given spatial modes are given in particle number representation , whereas the tensor product symbol between the spatial modes indicates full distinguishability between them .",
    "for simplicity , we will use the abbreviated notation @xmath38 and omit the tensor product symbol .",
    "the core of our construction is the following definition of a new basis : @xmath39 where the vector @xmath40 is defined as the @xmath41-th eigenvector of the last ( diagonal ) generalized gell - mann matrix of dimension @xmath42 .",

    "this would suggest that correlations beyond lowest order in the spin operators are necessary to detect entanglement . using the full set of gell - mann correlations",
    "gives a much stronger signal of entanglement , and thus this approach appears a more robust method of detecting entanglement .",
    "one advantage that our scheme has over other approaches ( e.g. using negativity @xcite ) is that it is based on correlations , rather than tomographically reconstructing the full density matrix .",
