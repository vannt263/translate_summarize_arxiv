    "ultracold fermi gases have been subject of many experimental and theoretical studies during recent years ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "they provide a unique system to study key concepts of condensed matter theory .",
    "this is because in these systems many parameters such as the particle density , the fermi energy , the confinement potential , or the interaction strength between the fermions , which in a solid state system are typically fixed quantities , can be externally controlled in a wide range @xcite . in particular , magnetic - field feshbach resonances provide the means for controlling the interaction strength between fermions by varying an external magnetic field .",
    "the tunability of the s - wave scattering length , which is the dominant interaction channel , makes ultracold fermi gases ideal for exploring different regimes of interacting many - body systems in a single system .",
    "this includes the limiting regimes of weakly attracting fermions , which condense into cooper pairs forming a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) phase below a certain temperature @xmath0 , and repulsive dimers formed by two fermions , which can undergo a bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) .",
    "these two limiting regimes are separated by the strongly interacting bcs - bec crossover regime where the scattering length diverges and the system exhibits unitary properties @xcite .",
    "in addition to the variable interaction strength , ultracold atomic gases offer a unique opportunity to explore the influence of a confinement on the pairing correlations , because dimensionality and confinement can be precisely controlled by tuning external parameters @xcite . varying the confinement ,",
    "which is often well approximated by a harmonic confinement potential , allows one to access new degrees of freedom . restricting the fermi gases to quasi - low dimensionality may",
    ", e.g. , offer the possibility for an experimental evidence of unconventional phases , like the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state @xcite .",
    "moreover it may help to study and get experimental insight into shape resonances , theoretically predicted for quasi - low dimensional conventional superconductors @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the first quantitative measurements of the transition from 2d to quasi-2d and 3d in a weakly interacting fermi gas has been reported . at low atom numbers , the shell structure associated with the filling of individual transverse oscillator states has been observed . on the theoretical side the ground state properties of a @xmath1li gas confined in a cigar - shaped laser trap",
    "have been investigated predicting size - dependent resonances of the superfluid gap @xcite , similar to the case of superconducting nanowires @xcite , yielding an atypical bcs - bec crossover .",
    "an important effort is now devoted to the exploration of the out - of - equilibrium behavior of trapped ultracold atomic fermi gases and , in particular , to the determination of their dynamical properties .",
    "the dynamics has been studied in the normal as well as in the condensed phase , observing second sound @xcite and soliton trains @xcite , and showing a low - frequency oscillation of the cloud after a change of the system confinement or optical excitation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , state - of - the - art technology allows one to change the coupling constant on such short time scales that it is possible to explore the regime where the many - body system is governed by a unitary evolution with nonequilibrium initial conditions . in ultracold atomic fermi gases the dynamics",
    "may be initiated by readjusting the pairing interaction through switching an external magnetic field in the region of a feshbach resonance ( i.e. , a quantum quench ) or by a rapid change of the confinement potential of the trap @xcite . due to the small energies in the trapping potential",
    "the dynamics in the fermi gases take place on a millisecond timescale . therefore ,",
    "in contrast to metallic superconductors , where sub - picosecond excitations are required to achieve non - adiabatic dynamics @xcite , in atomic gases the non - adiabatic regime can be reached already by excitations in the sub - millisecond range .",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking gives rise to collective modes of the order parameter which are classified into the higgs amplitude mode , and the goldstone mode , the latter corresponding to a phase oscillation of the gap @xcite .",
    "the higgs mode has been subject of intensive theoretical and experimental @xcite research efforts in the past . on the theoretical side the non - adiabatic temporal response of the order parameter to ( quasi-)instantaneous perturbations has been studied .",
    "different regimes of an oscillatory temporal behavior of the pairing potential were theoretically predicted in homogeneous fermionic condensates @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the amplitude of the order parameter oscillates without damping when the coupling constant is increased above a certain critical value @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the gap vanishes when the coupling constant is decreased below another critical value . in between these two limiting regimes",
    "the amplitude exhibits damped dephased oscillations and the system goes to a stationary steady state with a finite gap @xcite . in extended systems",
    "the approach to a stationary state occurs in an oscillatory way with an inverse square root decay in time of the amplitude of the oscillations @xcite .",
    "a similar evolution was predicted for conventional bulk superconductors @xcite where the non - adiabatic regime is reached by excitation with short , intense terahertz pulses .",
    "an experimental realization was reported in @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in finite length superconducting nanowires a breakdown of the damped oscillation and a subsequently rather irregular dynamics has been predicted @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a theoretical analysis of the short - time bcs dynamics of a @xmath1li gas confined in a cigar - shaped laser trap .",
    "the excitation is modeled by a sudden change of the interaction strength which can be achieved through a feshbach resonance by an abrupt change of the external magnetic field @xcite . applying the well - known bcs theory in mean field approximation to ultracold fermi gases",
    "we show that the change of the coupling strength induces a collective oscillation of the bogoliubov quasiparticles close to the fermi level .",
    "this results in a damped amplitude oscillation of the bcs gap , which corresponds to the higgs mode .",
    "like in the case of confined bcs superconductors this oscillation breaks down after a certain time revealing rather chaotic dynamics afterwards .",
    "we explain these dynamics in terms of coupled harmonic oscillators which can be derived by linearizing the quasiparticle dynamics obtained from the heisenberg equation of motion .    in doing",
    "so we first derive the quasiparticle equations of motion from the inhomogeneous bogoliubov - de gennes hamiltonian ( sec .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] ) which , because of using the standard contact - type interaction , requires a proper regularization of the gap equation .",
    "starting from the ground state calculated according to ref .",
    "@xcite we then calculate the dynamics of the superfluid gap after an instantaneous change of the coupling constant",
    ". the numerical results as well as their explanation follow in sec .  [ sec : results ] , where we first discuss a rather small system and then proceed to a larger , experimentally more easily accessible system . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our results and give some concluding remarks .",

    "the eigenvalues @xmath12 are measured with respect to the fermi energy @xmath13 .",
    "the index @xmath4 refers to the combination of quantum numbers @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 . for this geometry",

    "[ fig : states ] ] , while the states within each subband are labeled by @xmath16 .",
    "each subband has a constant one - particle density of states and thus the overall density of states exhibits finite jumps whenever a new subband appears .",
    "we consider the gas to be composed of two spin states , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and start from the inhomogeneous bcs hamiltonian at @xmath20 . within the anderson approximation",
    "we then derive equations of motion for the corresponding bogoliubov quasiparticle excitations .",

    "the main contribution to the interaction between two fermionic atoms in different internal spin states is given by scattering processes at low momentum .",
    "the description of those can be replaced by the widely known pseudopotential only depending on the scattering length @xmath27 @xcite , which yields @xmath28 .    a bcs - like mean field expansion in terms of anomalous expectation values and a particle - hole transformation , leaving spin - up operators unchanged , @xmath29 , while interchanging spin - down ones , @xmath30 , leads to the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) hamiltonian @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the bcs order parameter . from eq .",
    "it becomes apparent that the corresponding eigenvalue equation can be written as the one - particle bogoliubov - de gennes equation @xmath33 @xmath34 can thus be diagonalized by bogoliubov s transformation , using the eigenfunctions @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",

    "therefore , all quantities can be expressed solely using the @xmath45 state wave functions @xcite . in the following",
    "we omit the @xmath45 , @xmath46 index of the eigenfunctions while they are still necessary for the quasiparticle operators .",
    "hereafter in the case of the eigenfunctions the index @xmath4 refers to the @xmath45 states . for our further calculations it is convenient to transform to the excitation picture ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) with @xmath49 and @xmath50 , where all quasiparticle excitations vanish in the ground state .",
    "we can rewrite the order parameter in the basis given by the eigenfunctions , where it reads : @xmath51 this yields the well - known result for the ground state order parameter @xmath52 which has to be solved self - consistently with eq .",
    "focusing on the underlying physics , we exploit the anderson approximation ( a.a . )",
    "@xcite , choosing the bdg wave functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 proportional to the one - particle wave functions of the confinement potential @xmath55 , i.e. , @xmath56 here the amplitudes of the bdg wave functions @xmath57 , @xmath58 are obtained from the bdg eq .   and read @xmath59 with the quasiparticle energies given by @xmath60 and the one - particle energies @xmath61 given by eq . .",
    "applying the anderson approximation to eq .   additionally yields @xmath62 , where @xmath63 are the one - particle eigenfunctions .",
    "the anderson approximation has been tested in several nanostructured geometries and no qualitative deviations have been found @xcite .",
    "it is applied to all our calculations .    from eqs .",

    "since in the dynamical case the time - dependent gap @xmath75 differs from the ground state value this may seem unusual .",
    "however , we have checked that the method is not sensitive on the detailed parameters used , e.g. , on using one constant value for all @xmath74 in order to omit the newly introduced dependence .",
    "thus the proposed regularization scheme is a suitable extension since the physical behavior of the system remains unchanged . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : dispersion ] shows the dependence of the quasiparticle energies @xmath76 on the one - particle energies @xmath61 . for all subbands crossing the fermi energy finite minima of the quasiparticle energy evolve at @xmath77 .",
    "subbands with the minimum close to the fermi energy ( i.e. , @xmath78 ) exhibit a larger @xmath74 due to the larger interaction matrix elements @xmath66",
    ". this leads to a rather shallow parabolic - like minimum in these subbands and , thus , to a maximum in the corresponding density of states ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : densityofstates ] ) .",

    "@xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider an excitation of the fermi gas by a quantum quench , i.e. , a sudden change of the coupling constant @xmath80 . since in the region of a feshbach resonance",
    "the coupling constant strongly depends on an external magnetic field @xmath81 , this can be achieved experimentally by rapidly switching @xmath81 from an initial value @xmath82 to a final value @xmath83 .",
    "we assume that this switching process occurs on a time scale much faster than the characteristic time scale of the order parameter dynamics , such that the excitation can be taken to be instantaneous .",
    "this assumption is realistic since fast linear magnetic ramps with rates of @xmath84g / ms are experimentally available @xcite while the timescale of the gap dynamics is of the order of @xmath85ms @xcite .",
    "the excitations considered in this paper require a shift in the magnetic field of a few gauss , which indeed can be assumed to be instantaneous on the typical ms time scale in ultracold fermi gases . in this case during the switching of the magnetic field the state of the system remains unchanged .",
    "as usual , the dynamics of a quantum mechanical system can be described in different basis systems , which from a mathematical point of view are all equivalent . in our case , to calculate the dynamics of the order parameter after a quench from the _ initial _ system ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 ) to the _ final _ system ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath25 ) we choose a time - independent basis rather than remaining in the diagonal basis . for convenience",
    "we take the basis corresponding to the eigenstates of the system after the switching , i.e. , to the coupling constant @xmath25 .",
    "all our calculations are thus carried out in the basis @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "the initial state , which is characterized by the ground state order parameter @xmath89 , corresponding to the coupling constant @xmath88 and the basis functions @xmath86 , @xmath87 , has to be expressed in terms of the basis @xmath53 , @xmath54 , which in particular gives rise to non - vanishing quasiparticle excitations in this basis .",
    "since the confinement potential is unchanged , also the corresponding one - particle wave functions @xmath55 remain unchanged . according to eq .",

    "compared to the full dynamics .",
    ", in the dynamical calculations ( i.e. , in eqs .  , and ) the coupling has to be slightly lowered by a small amount , i.e. , @xmath146 .",
    "it should be mentioned that the full ( nonlinear ) equations never lead to divergences . ]",
    "the parameters correspond to the system shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamik+ft ] and are exemplary for all investigated systems .",
    "the linearized equations clearly reproduce the full dynamics and all its features in very good agreement .",
    "the inset shows that the positions as well as the strengths of most of the frequencies in the fourier spectra are well described by this approximation .",
    "the spectrum corresponding to the full equations of motion ( upper , red curve ) and the one corresponding to the linearized equation ( lower , black curve ) show only slight differences . only one low lying weak frequency component close to zero , which is present in the linearized version ( outside the range shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : linear_vergleich ] ) as well as weak side peaks that occur adjacent to every main peak in the full dynamics are not fully reproduced .",
    "the latter can be attributed to the nonlinear couplings .",
    "their influence on the dynamics , however , is obviously negligible .",
    "the main features of the gap dynamics can thus be explained on the basis of eq .  , which can be solved analytically .",
    "the analytic solution can be expressed in terms of a linear superposition of simple ( co)sine - oscillators .",
    "the corresponding frequencies are determined by the uncoupled oscillator frequencies @xmath147 and the coupling @xmath142 .",
    "they are thus completely fixed by the the system parameters and the bcs gap , but they are independent of the initial conditions . in the considered case of weak coupling",
    "the coupled spectrum is only slightly shifted compared to the uncoupled frequencies .",
    "the eigenfrequencies of the coupled dynamics are thus approximately given by twice the quasiparticle energies , as observed above .",
    "the amplitudes of the different eigenmodes of the coupled system are determined by the initial values of the dynamics and thus depend on the details of the excitation . in general",
    ", one observes that each of the quasiparticle oscillators @xmath148 carries strong contributions from oscillators in the vicinity of its uncoupled frequency @xmath147 and in areas of a high density of states .",
    "these areas are located close to the minimum of a quasiparticle subband ( see section [ sec : formalism ] ) , i.e. , near @xmath149 .",
    "in addition one observes that the contributions from each oscillator to the lowest energies are mostly in phase while these to higher energies are more and more out of phase .",
    "a sum of all quasiparticle oscillators , which according to eq .",
    "yields the bcs gap , thus leads to dynamics dominated by low - lying frequencies at a quasiparticle band minimum .",
    "these can be understood as cumulative peaks created by collective oscillations of all quasiparticles in the system .",
    "all spectra obtained by the full equations indeed show such a spectrum with rather dense , strong frequency contributions near @xmath150 and relatively widespread suppressed frequency contributions at higher energies .",
    "the explanations given above have shown that the gap dynamics can be understood as a linear superposition of quasiparticle oscillations which themselves are given by a sum of simple oscillators . to finally explain the main features of the gap dynamics in the time domain the damping , the transition and the irregular oscillation one can therefore use an even simpler picture of a set of independent cosine - oscillators with the frequencies @xmath147 .    due to the abrupt excitation",
    "all these oscillators start in phase at maximum deflection . starting to oscillate they will soon dephase .",
    "a sum of all oscillators ( i.e. , the gap ) thus performs a damped oscillation ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    "systems with several strong frequency contributions i.e . , resonant systems show a rather fast and persistent damping since a large part of the cumulative amplitude is able to dephase . off - resonant systems in contrast exhibit only a slight decay of the oscillation since the main part of the cumulative oscillation is carried by one single mode .    proceeding in time the damped oscillation continues until all oscillators are completely dephased and the amplitude of the oscillation is minimal .",
    "then the oscillators start to rephase , the amplitude grows and the oscillation reappears ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : uebergangszeit_entwicklung ] ; for off - resonant systems this effect is strongly suppressed since one single frequency dominates the spectrum ) .",
    "as soon as the first adjacent pair of oscillators goes back in phase again this beating - like pattern is interrupted .",
    "at this moment a spike in the cumulative oscillation indicates the breakdown of the regular oscillation and thus the transition time @xmath115 . afterwards",
    "all other frequencies rephase successively and create a rapid sequence of spikes which leaves a picture of an irregular oscillation .",
    "the preceding argumentation suggests that the time of this breakdown should be inversely proportional to the maximum spacing of adjacent quasiparticle energies . strictly speaking the transition times are found to be determined by adjacent quasiparticles from the same subband @xcite , i.e. , @xmath151 it thus increases @xmath152 with decreasing parallel confinement frequency since the energy spacing of the atomic spectrum then decreases .",
    "this is in full agreement with the relation found before .",
    "in fact , eq .   gives exactly the linear curve shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : uebergangszeit ] .",
    "this indicates that the breakdown of the smooth initial oscillation of the bcs gap indeed is due to adjacent frequencies rephasing in time .      as a final example the gap dynamics of a rather large system with @xmath153hz and @xmath154khz again after a sudden change of the scattering length from @xmath155 nm to @xmath117 nm",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamik_gross ] .",
    "this corresponds to a gas with @xmath156 and @xmath157 and is thus on an experimentally accessible length - scale @xcite .",
    "the fermi energy is chosen as @xmath158 which corresponds to @xmath159 atoms in the trap .",
    "nm to @xmath117 nm ; inset : fourier transform of the gap dynamics .",
    "the confinement frequencies are @xmath160khz and @xmath161hz . ]",
    "figure [ fig : dynamik_gross ] shows that the qualitative behavior of the gap dynamics is the same as for the smaller systems : a slowly decaying oscillation of the gap occurs .",
    "the transition time @xmath162 calculated from eq .",
    "is in good agreement with a small bump in the curve at @xmath163ms , the first deviation from a smooth oscillation .",
    "afterwards more and more deviations occur and the gap dynamics becomes successively irregular .",
    "when looking at the damping of the gap oscillation one can see that although the system is resonant one subband is close to the fermi energy the strength of the damping is situated somewhere between the resonant and the off - resonant case of fig .",
    "[ fig : resonant_vergleich ] .",
    "this is due to the weak perpendicular confinement and therefore large number of states contributing to the condensate : compared to the overall number of relevant states the resonant ones give only a small contribution to the gap . for larger systems",
    "the resonances are thus less pronounced @xcite .",
    "the fourier transform in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamik_gross ] shows a familiar picture , too , with strong contributions at the lower end of the spectrum and successively decaying peaks towards higher energies .",
    "the difference with respect to the spectra shown before is on the one hand the high density of peaks for the large system .",
    "this is due to the weaker confinement and thus higher density of bare and quasiparticle states . on the other hand",
    "the gap in the fourier spectrum and thus the main frequency of the oscillation is comparatively small .",
    "this is because of the larger ratio of the perpendicular to the parallel length @xmath164 . with the fermi energy fixed at @xmath165 this leads to a comparatively low particle density of the trapped gas and thus a weaker condensate and a smaller gap .",
    "in conclusion , we have calculated the higgs amplitude dynamics in the bcs phase of an ultracold @xmath166li gas confined in a cigar - shaped trap .",
    "the dynamics is induced by a quantum quench resulting from a sudden change of an external magnetic field .",
    "we have shown that the amplitude of the spatially averaged gap performs a damped oscillation breaking down after a certain time @xmath115 , which is determined by the parallel confinement frequency @xmath127 , i.e. , by the length of the cloud . afterwards",
    "a rather irregular oscillation involving many different frequencies occurs .",
    "we have investigated the influence of the confinement on the gap dynamics and the impact of the size - dependent superfluid resonances on its qualitative behavior .",
    "it turned out that in the case of a resonant system , i.e. , a system where the fermi energy is close to a subband minimum , the dynamics of the order parameter exhibits a strong damping and , for sufficiently long systems , a revival before eventually the irregular regime is reached .",
    "in contrast , in an off - resonant system the damping is much less pronounced and the oscillation before the transition to the irregular regime is mainly determined by a single frequency .    by analyzing the linearized version of the equations of motion for the quasiparticle excitations we were able to interpret the observed features of the dynamics .",
    "it turned out that for the excitations studied in this paper the linearized equations well reproduce the dynamical behavior of the gap , except for some slight details resulting from the nonlinearities in the full equations of motion . from the linearized model it becomes evident that the system approximately behaves like a set of weakly coupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "the frequencies as well as the couplings of these oscillators are completely determined by the system parameters after the excitation while the amplitudes of the different eigenmodes depend on the details of the excitation . the analysis revealed in particular that the transition time to the irregular dynamics is directly related to the energy separation of the one - particle energies while the differences between resonant and non - resonant systems is caused by the different densities of states and coupling efficiencies close to the subband minima ."
