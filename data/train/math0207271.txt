    "in this paper we continue the research on extensions of locally compact ( l.c . ) quantum groups , initiated in @xcite . the first wide class of l.c .",
    "quantum groups , namely g.i .",
    "kac algebras , was introduced in the early sixties ( see @xcite ) in order to explain in a symmetric way duality for l.c .  groups .",
    "this class included besides usual l.c .",
    "groups and their duals also nontrivial ( i.e. , non - commutative and non - cocommutative ) objects @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the general kac algebra theory was completed independently on the one hand by g.i .",
    "kac and the second author @xcite and on the other hand by m.  enock and j .- m .",
    "schwartz ( for a survey see @xcite ) . however , this theory was not general enough to cover important new examples constructed starting from the eighties @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite - @xcite , which motivated essential efforts to get a generalization that would cover these examples and that would be as elegant and symmetric as the theory of kac algebras .",
    "important steps in this direction were made by s.  baaj and g.  skandalis @xcite , s.l .",
    "woronowicz @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , t.  masuda and y. nakagami @xcite and a.  van daele @xcite . the general theory of l.c .",
    "quantum groups was proposed by j.  kustermans and the first author @xcite , @xcite ( see @xcite for an overview ) . some motivations and applications of this theory",
    "can be found in the recent lecture notes @xcite .",
    "the mentioned examples of l.c .",
    "quantum groups are , first of all , formulated algebraically , in terms of generators of hopf @xmath1-algebras and commutation relations between them .",
    "then one represents the generators as ( typically , unbounded ) operators on a hilbert space and tries to give a meaning to the commutation relations as relations between these operators .",
    "there is no general approach to this nontrivial problem , and one elaborates specific methods in each specific case . finally , it is necessary to associate an operator algebra with the above system of operators and commutation relations and to construct comultiplication , antipode and invariant weights as applications related to this algebra .",
    "this problem is even more difficult than the previous one and again one must consider separately each specific case ( see the same papers ) .",
    "so , it would be desirable to have some general constructions of l.c .",
    "quantum groups which would allow to construct systematically concrete examples in a unified way .",
    "one of such possibilities is offered by the _ cocycle bicrossed product construction_. according to g.i .",
    "kac @xcite , in the simplest case the needed data for this construction contains :    1 .   a pair of finite groups @xmath2 and @xmath3 equipped with their mutual actions on each other ( as on sets ) or , equivalently",
    ", @xmath2 and @xmath3 must be subgroups of a certain group @xmath4 such that @xmath5 and any @xmath6 can be written as @xmath7 - we write briefly @xmath8 .",
    "we then say , that @xmath2 and @xmath3 form _ a matched pair of groups _",
    "2 .   a pair of compatible 2-cocycles for these actions , so @xmath2 and @xmath3 must form _ a cocycle matched pair _ ( in what follows we often write simply `` cocycle '' rather then `` 2-cocycle '' ) .    then , due to @xcite , one can construct a finite - dimensional kac algebra from cocycle crossed products of the algebras of functions on each of the groups @xmath2 and @xmath3 with the cocycle action of the other group , and this construction gives exactly all extensions of the above groups in the category of finite - dimensional kac algebras .",
    "it is tempting to similarly treat lie groups instead of finite groups , being supported by the theory of cocycle bicrossed products and extensions of l.c .",
    "groups developed in @xcite ( in fact , in @xcite , the general theory of cocycle bicrossed products and extensions of l.c .",
    "_ quantum _ groups was developed ) . but",
    "first of all it turns out that the above definition of a matched pair of groups in terms of the equality @xmath8 does not cover all interesting examples , see @xcite . following s.  baaj and g.  skandalis",
    ", one can just require @xmath9 to be an open subset of @xmath4 with complement of measure zero .",
    "then , the lie algebras @xmath10 of @xmath2 and @xmath11 of @xmath3 are lie subalgebras of the lie algebra @xmath12 of @xmath4 and @xmath13 as the direct sum of vector spaces , i.e. , they form a matched pair of lie algebras @xcite , 8.3 . thus , to get matched pairs of lie groups one can start with matched pairs of lie algebras ( which are easier to find ) and then try to exponentiate them .    to construct in this way cocycle matched pairs of lie groups , one has to resolve two problems .",
    "first , given a matched pair of lie algebras @xmath14 with @xmath13 , one can always exponentiate @xmath12 to a connected and simply connected lie group @xmath4 and then find lie subgroups @xmath2 and @xmath3 whose lie algebras are @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "however , such a choice of @xmath4 does not guarantee that @xmath15 is dense in @xmath4 , even if @xmath16 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and it also may happen that @xmath17 .",
    "so , it is necessary to pass to some non - connected lie group @xmath4 with the same lie algebra @xmath12 in order to find a matched pair of its subgroups @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "secondly , given a matched pair of lie groups , one has to find the corresponding cocycles .",
    "we give a solution of both these problems for _ real _ lie groups @xmath2 and",
    "@xmath3 with @xmath18 and construct essentially all possible ( up to obvious redundancies ) matched pairs of such lie groups having at most 2 connected components . then , using the machinery of cocycle bicrossed products developed in @xcite , we construct l.c .",
    "quantum groups which are extensions of the mentioned lie groups .",
    "our discussion is motivated , apart from the above work by g.i .",
    "kac , also by the works by s. majid @xcite - @xcite , s. baaj and g. skandalis @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and by the works on extensions of hopf algebras @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the material is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we recall the necessary facts of the theory of l.c .",
    "quantum groups and , following @xcite , the main features of the cocycle bicrossed product construction for l.c .",
    "groups in connection with the theory of extensions . in the last subsection",
    "we introduce the notion of a closed normal quantum subgroup of a l.c .  quantum group and",
    "explain its relation to the theory of extensions . as we explained above ,",
    "the basic notion of this theory is that of a matched pair of l.c .  groups .",
    "if the groups forming a matched pair are lie groups , we naturally have a matched pair of their lie algebras .",
    "but the converse problem , to construct a matched pair of lie groups from a given matched pair @xmath14 of lie algebras , is much more subtle .",
    "in particular , in section 3 we show that any matched pair with @xmath19 can be exponentiated to a matched pair of complex lie groups , but there are simple examples of matched pairs of real and complex lie algebras for which the exponentiation is impossible .",
    "the study of matched pairs of lie algebras with @xmath20 in section  4 splits in three cases . in case 1 , when @xmath10 is an ideal in @xmath21 can be constructed as semi - direct product of connected and simply connected lie groups corresponding to @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( this is possible also for @xmath22 ) . in case 2 , when @xmath10 contains an ideal of codimension 1 , the results of section 3 show that for complex lie algebras the exponentiation always exists when @xmath23 and it does not exist in general if @xmath24 . for real lie algebras we show that for @xmath25 there always exists the exponentiation to a matched pair of lie groups with at most two connected components , and for @xmath26 the exponentiation does not exist in general . in the remaining case 3",
    ", for complex lie algebras the exponentiation always exists when @xmath27 and it does not exist in general if @xmath28 . for real lie algebras we show that the exponentiation always exists when @xmath25 .",
    "section  5 is devoted to the complete classification of all matched pairs of real lie algebras @xmath10 and @xmath11 when @xmath29 and to their explicit exponentiation to matched pairs of real lie groups having at most 2 connected components . here",
    ", we also describe the l.c .",
    "quantum groups obtained from these matched pairs by the bicrossed product construction . in section  6 , we calculate the cocycles for all the above mentioned matched pairs .",
    "finally , section  7 is devoted to the description of l.c .",
    "quantum groups with 2 and 3 generators and their infinitesimal objects - hopf @xmath0-algebras and lie bialgebras , having the structure of a cocycle bicrossed product - equivalently , those that can be obtained as extensions ( we call them decomposable ) . at last , to complete the picture of low - dimensional l.c .",
