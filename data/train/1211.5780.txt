    "<S> we study the phase diagram of a two - dimensional ultracold fermi gas with the synthetic spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) that has recently been realized at nist . due to the coexistence of anisotropic soc and effective zeeman fields in the nist scheme , the system shows rich structure of phase separation involving exotic gapless superfluid and fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) pairing states with different center - of - mass momentum . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we characterize the stability region of fflo states and demonstrate their unique features under soc . </S>",

    "<S> these interesting features may be probed for example by measuring the _ in - situ _ density profiles or by the momentum - resolved radio - frequency spectroscopy .    </S>",

    "<S> a great amount of efforts have recently been dedicated to the clarification of novel phases and phase transitions in a spin - orbit coupled , strongly interacting fermi gas of ultracold atoms , where the interplay of soc , pairing superfluidity and effective zeeman fields can lead to exotic superfluid phases in various dimensions @xcite .    while most of these studies assume the rashba soc , only an equal rashba and dresselhaus ( erd ) soc has been realized in experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> with spatial anisotropy and effectively reduced soc dimension , the nist soc can lead to qualitatively different superfluid phases compared to those under rashba soc @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the picture is further complicated by the existence of effective zeeman fields , both axial and transverse , in the nist scheme , which are tunable by adjusting the laser parameters @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the parameters for ( a)(b ) are : @xmath41 , @xmath58 , @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) typical gapless contours in momentum space for an fflo@xmath53 state in the presence of transverse zeeman field , with the parameters : @xmath43 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> ( d ) typical gapless contours in momentum space for an fflo@xmath59 state in the presence of transverse zeeman field , with the parameters : @xmath41 , @xmath58 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77.,title=\"fig:\",width=325 ]    with this understanding , we calculate the typical phase diagram for finite @xmath11 ( see fig . [ fig3](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> apparently , the most striking effect of the transverse field is the stabilization of fflo@xmath59 states over a large parameter region , with the center - of - mass momentum of the fflo@xmath59 states opposite to the direction of the nist soc ( @xmath78 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is qualitatively consistent with the findings in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where a 3d fermi gas with rashba soc and transverse fields was considered . </S>",
    "<S> when the soc strength increases , the magnitude of @xmath60 decreases exponentially as the fermi surface asymmetry decreases , and the energy of the fflo@xmath59 state becomes exponentially close to that of an sf state ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](a)(b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> similar scaling relations can be found with increasing @xmath50 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath9 or @xmath50 increases , when the magnitude of @xmath60 becomes sufficiently small , the fflo@xmath59 state undergoes a continuous transition and becomes fully gapped . in the weak coupling limit , this gapped fflo state ( gfflo@xmath59 ) can be understood as a pairing state within one helicity band , where the fermi surface deformation induced by transverse field is accommodated by a finite center - of - mass momentum ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that such an exotic pairing state is characteristic of the co - existence of soc and fermi surface asymmetry , and is not limited to systems under nist soc . on the other hand , the existence of various first - order boundaries and end points in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) suggests stabilization of fflo states with different @xmath60 and @xmath27 , consistent with our previous analysis . </S>",
    "<S> these fflo@xmath59 states eventually merge into a single fflo@xmath59 state beyond the end points . for finite @xmath11 </S>",
    "<S> , we can still find considerable stability region for the fflo@xmath53 state , which is bounded from the fflo@xmath59 or gfflo@xmath59 states by first - order boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> the typical dispersion of the fflo@xmath53 state here has the symmetry @xmath79 . this is reflected in the contours of the gapless points ( see fig . [ fig4](c ) ) , which is qualitatively different from that of an fflo@xmath59 state ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](d ) ) .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusion_. we have studied the exotic phases in a 2d fermi gas under the nist soc . </S>",
    "<S> the competition between the effective zeeman fields and the anisotropic soc leads to complicated phase structures , implying multiple phase separated states for a uniform gas and rich spatial phase structure for a trapped gas . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , we demonstrate that various fflo states , including a fully gapped fflo state , can be stabilized under the nist soc . while the unique dispersion spectra and gapless contours of the fflo states may serve as signatures for experimental detection </S>",
    "<S> , the various first - order phase transitions should also leave signatures in the _ in - situ _ density profiles of a trapped gas .    _ </S>",
