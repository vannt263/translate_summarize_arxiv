    "understanding of galaxy formation has undergone impressive developments in recent years . on the observational side ,",
    "a key step in the study of the statistical properties of high - redshift galaxies has been taken with the discovery of the \" lyman - break  galaxies at @xmath8 ( steidel et al .",
    "1996 ; adelberger et al .",
    "1998 ) ; other important steps have been taken with the estimate of the cosmic star formation rate ( see madau , pozzetti & dickinson 1998 ; fontana et al .",
    "1999 ) , and the measurement of the galaxy luminosity functions ( lfs ) at redshifts up to @xmath9 for uv luminosities extending over the range @xmath10 ( steidel et al .",
    "1999 from spectroscopic data , pozzetti et al . 1998 and",
    "poli et al .",
    "2001 from photometric redshifts ) .",
    "these results , with their unprecedented span in both cosmic time and magnitude , boosted the developement of an `` ab initio '' theory of galaxy formation .",
    "the theory has been firmly rooted into the cosmological framework with the development of semi - analytic models ( sams , kauffmann et al .",
    "1993 ; cole et al . 1994",
    "; somerville & primack 1999 ; poli et al .",
    "1999 ; wu , fabian & nulsen 2000 ; cole et al .",
    "2000 ) which link in a single computational structure two main blocks : the dynamical history of galaxies as they emerge from primordial dark matter ( dm ) density perturbations and grow through hierarchical merging events ; the baryonic processes in the galactic structures , namely , gas cooling , star formation , rise and fall of stellar populations , energy feedback from supernovae .",
    "such advances in both theory and observations are pushing the comparison between models and data to higher and higher degrees of accuracy .",
    "a key role is played by the @xmath11-resolved lfs .",
    "in fact , the earliest sams were calibrated to fit the locally observed lf ( still with considerable uncertainties in the normalization and in the slope at the faint end ) , and were tested at higher redshift through integrated counts and @xmath11-distributions .",
    "the recent observations are producing a progressive convergence of the local lfs found by different groups ( see zucca et al .",
    "1997 , cross et al .",
    "2001 ) down to @xmath12 , with the additional indication that at the faint end the shape is more complex than represented by a schechter form ( see marzke , huchra & geller 1994 ; loveday 1997 ) .",
    "in addition , the resolved lfs now begin to describe the evolution of the galaxy population out to @xmath9 , thus providing a _ differential _",
    "test for the model predictions .",
    "the comparison of the models with such data supports the grand design of hierarchical galaxy formation , but indicates that some of the processes included in the sams require an improved treatement .",
    "for example , the lfs predicted at @xmath7 overestimate the number of faint ( @xmath13 ) galaxies by a factor @xmath14 when compared with observations based on photometric reshifts ( see somerville , primack & faber 2001 ; poli et al .",
    "2001 ) , and the excess goes beyond the estimated incompleteness of the data faintwards of @xmath15 . a similar trend , though less evident , is found in the redshift range around @xmath16 ( poli et al .",
    "2001 ) , while at @xmath1 the observed upturn in the lf at the faint is not accounted for in the current sam predictions . addressing the above critical points is crucial to fully understand the physical processes driving the galaxy evolution .",
    "the shape of the predicted lf at faint and intermediate luminosities is affected by two main processes .",
    "the first concerns the effect of supernovae ( sn hereafter ) which heat and partially expell the galactic gas .",
    "a stronger sn feedback would suppress star formation in smaller haloes thus decreasing their b and uv luminosity and flattening the lf at the faint end .",
    "however , in the framework of the simple parametrizations currently adopted in sams it is extremely difficult to increase such feedback without destroying the agreement of the model with other observables ; in particular , the predicted luminosities for small spiral galaxies would be too faint when compared with existing data concerning the tully - fisher relation ( see cole et al .",
    "attempts at non- parametric treatements of the feedback have been made by mac low & ferrara ( 1999 ) ; goodwin , pearce & thomas ( 2000 ) ; monaco ( 2001 ) .",
    "different sources of feedback , like that arising from the photoionization of the inter - galactic medium by stars and quasars , have been recently included in the sam framework ( benson et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the other component affecting the shape of the lf is the mass distribution of the galaxies , which is determined by the detailed dynamical processes taking place inside the host dm haloes . among these ,",
    "tidal stripping and binary aggregations of satellite galaxies play a relevant role .",
    "however , the former affects mainly the very low - mass end of the mass distribution at circular velocities @xmath17 km / s , and has a minor impact on the faint end of the lf ( see benson et al .",
    "2001 ) ; so we shall focus here on binary aggregations .",
    "such a process is treated in current sams only under the approximation of orbital decay toward a central dominant galaxy . here",
    "we extend the treatement to include aggregations between all galaxies in common dm haloes .",
    "on the other hand , we shall adopt the standard sam prescriptions concerning star formation to derive the galaxy lf from the mass distribution ; no additional starburst recipes are associated with the aggregation events between satellite galaxies .",
    "this allows us to single out the dynamical effects of our description without introducing new ( and uncertain ) free parameters in the model , as we discuss in  6 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the derivation of the mass function in the framework of sams , and the motivation for our improved treatment are discussed in  2 .",
    "a technical description of our approach is presented in  3 , where we show how we fit our treatment of binary aggregations into the canonical sam framework . in ",
    "4 we briefly recall the basic prescriptions that we share with other sams to correlate the gas cooling , the star formation and evolution , and the sn feedback with the dynamical history of the galaxies . the lfs we derive are compared with the data in  5 . in",
    "6 we discuss our results and present our conclusions .",
    "in sams the galaxy mass distribution is derived from the merging histories of the host dm haloes , under the assumption that the galaxies contained in each halo coalesce into a central dominant galaxy if their dynamical friction timescale is shorter than the halo survival time ; the surviving galaxies ( commonly referred to as satellite galaxies ) retain their identity and continue to orbit within the halo . while the histories of the dm condensations rely on a well established framework ( the extended press & schechter theory , epst , see bower 1991 ; bond et al .",
    "1991 ; lacey & cole 1993 ) , the recipe concerning the galaxy fate inside the dm haloes is guided by _",
    "a posteriori _ consistency with the outputs of high - resolution n - body simulations .    in reality ,",
    "additional dynamical processes complement the dynamical friction in driving the evolution of the mass distribution . among these ,",
    "binary aggregations between satellite galaxies in common haloes have previously been considered by cavaliere , colafrancesco & menci ( 1991 , 1992 ) ; cavaliere , & menci ( 1993 ) , as a process that would flatten the shape of the mass function ( and hence of the lf ) at small / intermediate masses .",
    "this is because such masses aggregate into larger units , while the large masses are so few that their binary encounters are unlikely . in the above papers ,",
    "the aggregation - driven evolution of the mass distribution was computed in terms of the _ non - linear _ smoluchowski kinetic equation with a mass - dependent aggregation rate .",
    "the results showed that the effectiveness of the process depends critically on the environment , which in those models was a given input .",
    "to describe at the same time the galaxy dynamics and the evolution of the host haloes by hierarchical clustering , high - resolution n - body simulations or sams are required .    on the n - body side , recent works ( see klypin et al .",
    "1999 for pure dm , and murali et al .",
    "2001 for hydrodynamical simulations ) indicate a complex galaxy growth .",
    "while at very low circular velocities ( @xmath17 km / s ) tidal stripping may affect the mass distribution ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ; see also taylor & babul 2000 ; taffoni et al .",
    "2001 ) , at larger masses ( @xmath18 km / s ) binary aggregations of satellite galaxies do play a relevant role which complements the coalescence into a central galaxy through dynamical friction .",
    "indeed , murali et al .",
    "( 2001 ) analyze the competing role of the two growth modes of the simulated galaxies in terms of an evolutionary equation which includes also a binary aggregation term of the smoluchowski type .    on the sam side , efforts to insert the aggregations between satellite galaxies",
    "have recently been started by somerville & primack ( 1999 ) .",
    "however , they adopt a cross section ( derived from the n - body simulations of galaxy encounters by makino & hut 1997 ) valid for equal galaxies in clusters with velocity dispersion much higher than the internal galaxy dispersion , a condition that allowed them to adopt a one- body treatement for the aggregations .    here",
    "we take a step forward , and consider in closer detail the actual _ two - body _ dynamics of aggregations ; we shall also adopt a cross section valid down to small groups with velocity dispersions close to those internal to galaxies , as is the case at early times in the hierarchical clustering picture .",
    "in fact , we develop a sam including both dynamical friction and binary aggregations . instead of employing a monte carlo simulation , as usual for sams , we follow the evolution of the galaxy mass distribution by solving numerically a set of evolutionary equations , as in poli et al .",
    "the subset describing the two - body dynamics is constituted by the ( non - linear ) kinetic smoluchowski equation .",
    "this modifies the mass function resulting from dynamical friction by an amount which depends on the properties of the host dm haloes , which in turn evolve according to the epst theory . the basic description of gas cooling , star formation and evolution , and sn feedback is kept unchanged with respect to the standard sam prescriptions given , e.g. , by poli et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and cole et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "we first compare our results with those from existing n - body simulations , and then compare our lfs with those obtained from spectroscopic and deep imaging surveys down to faint magnitutes ( @xmath19 ) , at redshifts up to @xmath9 .",
    "this allows us to test the effects of binary aggregations on the sam predictions over a wide range of cosmic times and masses .",
    "we consider the number @xmath20 per mpc@xmath21 of galaxies with mass in the range @xmath22 about @xmath23 , residing in haloes with masses in the range @xmath24 to @xmath25 at cosmic time @xmath26 . at the initial time @xmath27",
    "we assign one galaxy to each halo , a condition which formally translates into @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the dirac delta function .",
    "our default choice for the halo mass distribution @xmath30 is the standard press & schechter ( 1974 ) expression , whose dependence on the cosmological parameters and on the spectrum of primordial density perturbation is recalled in appendix a ; but we shall also explore the effects of adopting the sheth & tormen ( 1999 ) mass distribution , also recalled in appendix a.    given the merging history of dm haloes described by epst , two main processes affect the evolution of @xmath31 : the orbital decay of satellite galaxies onto a central dominant galaxy due to dynamical friction , and the binary aggregations between satellite galaxies . in the following two subsections",
    "we investigate the effects of the above processes on the evolution of @xmath31 . a schematic view of the two dynamical processes driving the growth of galaxies in our model is given in fig .",
    "the corresponding evolution of the mass distribution of galaxies is presented in the last subsection 3.4 .    [ 0.43 ]     fig .",
    "1 . - a schematic representation of the various terms contributing to the evolution of the galaxy velocity function @xmath32 inside dm haloes of circular velocity @xmath33 .",
    "the first three processes marked with df correspond to the construction and destruction terms ( eq .",
    "1 ) from dynamical friction following the merging of the host haloes ( see text ) .",
    "the last two processes , marked with ba , represent binary aggregations of satellite galaxies ( see eq .",
    "3 ) inside the dm host halo .",
    "their combined effects drive the evolution of @xmath34 .      in the following",
    "we shall frequently adopt the circular velocities as the proper quantity to mark the depth of the potential wells of galaxies and of their host haloes .",
    "as for the latter , this is related to the mass through the relation @xmath35 where the limiting radius @xmath36 is the radius within which the mean mass density is @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the critical density at the redhsift @xmath11 where the halo is identified .",
    "the relation between @xmath36 and @xmath24 is given , e.g. , in navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 ) and mo , mao & white ( 1998 ) and takes the form @xmath39^{-1/3}\\,(1+z)^{-1}\\,h^{-1}\\,kpc$ ] for einstein - de - sitter ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) , open ( @xmath42 , @xmath41 ) , and flat ( @xmath43 ) universes .",
    "as to a galaxy inside a host dm halo , the circular velocity @xmath44 is related to @xmath23 through @xmath45 ; here @xmath46 is the tidal radius , within which the mean density of the galaxy exceeds the average density of the host halo interior the pericentre of the galactic orbit .",
    "this ensures that the galactic subhalo survives the tidal stripping due to the host halo potential wells and retains its own identity .",
    "our computation of @xmath46 is given in appendix b.    the above relations allow us to relate the mass and the circular velocity distributions by applying the proper jacobian .    the evolution of @xmath34 driven by dynamical friction is computed as follows .",
    "at each time step , we first compute the conditional probability @xmath47 that a given halo with circular velocity @xmath33 at time @xmath26 has a progenitor with circular velocity @xmath48 at @xmath49 ; this is calculated in the framework of the epst , and its expression ( depending on cosmology and on the perturbation spectrum as given in bower 1991 ; bond et al .",
    "1991 ; white & frenk 1991 , lacey & cole 1993 ) , is recalled in appendix a for a generic @xmath50 ( see eq . a-3 ) .",
    "similarly , from the epst we compute the inverse conditional probability @xmath51 that a given halo with circular velocity @xmath33 at time @xmath26 ends up in a halo with circular velocity @xmath48 at @xmath52 ( see eq .",
    "according to the canonical prescriptions usually adopted by sams , during halo merging a galaxy contained in one of the parent halos contributes to enrich the dominant galaxy of the common halo of circular velocity @xmath33 if its coalescence time @xmath53 is shorter than the halo survival time @xmath54 predicted in the epst .",
    "the circular velocity of the merger is then equated to that of the host halo . or",
    "else , for @xmath55 , the galaxy retains its identity .",
    "thus the increment in the number @xmath34 of galaxies of given @xmath44 in halos of given @xmath33 is linked to the increment of dm halos with @xmath33 , whose contribution from progenitors @xmath48 is @xmath56 ; the link occurs through the probabilities : i ) of forming one dominant galaxy of circular velocity @xmath57 by coalescing galaxies contained in the parent halos with lower velocities @xmath58 ; ii ) of finding galaxies with velocities @xmath44 which have not coalesced despite the merging of their host haloes .",
    "the corresponding decrement is due to the inclusion of galaxies with current velocity @xmath44 into a larger halo @xmath59 .",
    "the construction and destruction terms described above are schematically represented in the upper part of fig .",
    "the corresponding evolution of @xmath34 in a single timestep @xmath60 is expressed by @xmath61 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\delta   t\\,\\int_{v}^{v}\\,dv ' \\,n_h(v',t)\\ , { d^2 p_h(v'\\rightarrow v , t)\\over   d v ' d t}\\ ,   { n(v , v')\\over n_{t}(v')}\\,\\big\\{1-prob\\big[\\tau_{df}(v)<\\tau_l ( v)\\big]\\big\\ }   \\nonumber\\\\ & - & \\delta t\\,\\int_{v}^{\\infty}\\,dv ' { d^2 p_h(v\\rightarrow   v',t)\\over   d v ' d t}\\,n(v , v ) ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the total number of galaxies per @xmath63 , per unit halo rotational velocity .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side implies that if any galaxy with circular velocity @xmath64 is included in a halo with circular velocity @xmath33 and its orbit decays ( due to dynamical friction ) to the center of such a halo within the halo survival time , then a central galaxy with velocity @xmath57 is formed inside the halo .",
    "coalescence is caused by loss of galaxy energy and orbital angular momentum due to dynamical friction to the halo material .",
    "the timescale of such process is usually determined through orbit averaging of the chandrasekhar formula ( see lacey & cole 1993 ) ; the result is given in cole et al .",
    "( 2000 ) as follows : @xmath65 here @xmath66 is the dynamical time of the halo , and @xmath67^{0.78}\\,[r_c(r)/r]^2 $ ] contains the dependence on the initial energy @xmath68 and angular momentum @xmath69 of the galaxies , in terms of the angular momentum @xmath70 and the radius @xmath71 of the circular orbits corresponding to @xmath68 . although the values of @xmath72 are statistically distributed ( approximately following a lognormal function with @xmath73 and @xmath74 , see tormen 1997 ) , in the following we shall use for @xmath72 its average value .",
    "note that the orbit averaging procedure ( adopted to derive eq .",
    "2 ) is not appropriate for very elongated orbits for which the local density varies on a much shorter timescale than that given by eq .",
    "( 2 ) ; however , such orbits are expected to be a minority ( @xmath75 , see ghigna et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the probability @xmath76 $ ] for a dm halo of velocity @xmath33 to have a survival time @xmath77 larger than a given value @xmath78 has been computed by lacey & cole ( 1993 , see their eq . 2.21 ) in the framework of the epst , and is recalled in appendix a.      in addition to the above coalescence process , we include binary aggregations .",
    "so for each dm halo with circular velocity @xmath33 , we compute the further evolution of the galaxy mass distribution in a timestep due to binary aggregations .",
    "this is described by the smoluchowski equation , which we write in terms of masses for the sake of simplicity : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the aggregation rate depending on the dm halo where the galaxies @xmath23 and @xmath81 reside .",
    "the first term describes the construction of galaxies with mass @xmath23 from smaller ones with mass @xmath81 and @xmath82 , while the second represents the destruction of galaxies @xmath23 due to their aggregation with others .",
    "a schematic representation of the two terms governing the binary aggregations is given in the lower part of fig .",
    "the aggregation rate is governed by @xmath83 ( see cavaliere , colafrancesco & menci 1992 ) . here",
    "@xmath84 is the average relative velocity of galaxies in the dm halo whose rms value is equal to twice the halo 1-d velocity dispersion @xmath85 , and @xmath86 is the cross section .",
    "the latter is given for nearly grazing , weakly hyperbolic encounters by saslaw ( 1985 ) , and by cavaliere , colafrancesco , & menci ( 1992 ) .",
    "it includes a geometrical term ( proportional to the area of the galaxies ) , and a focussing factor @xmath87 that accounts for the enhancement of @xmath86 in slow encounters with resonance between the internal and the orbital degrees of freedom ( see also binney & tremaine 1986 ) .",
    "thus , the average rate for binary aggregations is @xmath88 where the average is over the relative velocities @xmath84 .",
    "the distribution of the encounter velocities is assumed to be maxwellian , namely @xmath89    note that for encounters between equal galaxies with @xmath90 and @xmath91 the scaling of the aggregation rate ( [ aggtime ] ) reduces to @xmath92 .",
    "performing the average over the distribution @xmath93 in terms of the rescaled variable @xmath94 yields @xmath95 , where the function @xmath96 tends to a constant when the ratio @xmath97",
    ". thus the aggregation rate ( [ aggtime ] ) reduces to the expression given by makino & hut ( 1997 )  originally derived analytically by mamon ( 1992 )  and the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( 3 ) becomes proportional to @xmath98 ( the effective rate adopted by somerville & primack 1999 ) in the proper limits of large encounter velocities relative to the internal galaxy velocity dispersion , and of encounters between equal galaxies .",
    "finally , note that after performing the average of eq .",
    "( 4 ) over the distribution @xmath93 only @xmath99 enters the computation ; in other words , we use an average description for encounter velocities typical of the environment considered .",
    "the geometrical cross section contained in eq .",
    "( 4 ) does not properly describe single events with @xmath100 , but these are rare for our typical values of @xmath101 in the range from @xmath102 to about @xmath103 . in cases with larger ratios @xmath101 the effect of the aggregations is suppressed since @xmath104 as shown above , but even inside rich clusters the averaged cross section that we adopt is consistent with the simulation results , see makino & hut ( 1997 ) ; for numerical computations of the role of interactions inside clusters see also lanzoni ( 2000 ) .    in sum , our cross section provides an accurate _ average _ description of aggregations in systems where the velocity dispersion is close to the galaxy circular velocity and the focussing term is relevant ; on the other hand , it constitutes an effective average approximation for encounters in environments with large velocity dispersion up to the scale of rich clusters , where the aggregations are disfavoured anyway . as a final global check",
    ", we have verified that the insertion of an artificial cutoff at @xmath105 in @xmath86 does not change our results .",
    "the equations ( [ dynfrict ] ) and ( [ smoluch ] ) describing the evolution of @xmath31 are integrated numerically on a grid of circular velocities and cosmic times with step @xmath106 .    in order to test our numerical code",

[ dftime ] ) as compared to the survival time of the halo ( which is of order @xmath137 ) . as a consequence , while at high redshift the merging of haloes is promptly followed by coalescence of the galaxies within them , at later times the number of galaxies accumulating in the haloes increases due to the longer time taken by dynamical friction to occur . at small masses",

    "we have verified that the sam results are robust to smaller values down to @xmath257 , as discussed by cole et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "finally , we recall the expression for the mass function recently proposed by sheth & tormen ( 1999 ; see also sheth , mo & tormen 2001 ) to provide a better fit to the n - body results . this has the form @xmath258\\ , { \\delta_c(t)\\over\\sigma(m)}\\ , \\,e^{-{a\\delta_c^2(t)\\over 2\\,\\sigma^2(m ) } } ~.\\ ] ] the values of the fitting coefficients @xmath259 , @xmath260 and @xmath261 are obtained by the above authors from comparison with the n - body results .",
    "the agreement of the above expression for @xmath262 with the simulations has been confirmed by an independent analysis ( jenkins et al .",
    "we derive the average value for the tidal radius @xmath46 of galaxies orbiting inside a host halo with radius @xmath36 and circular velocity @xmath33 .",
    "such a radius is that appropriate for a galactic subhalo which survives the tidal stripping of the host halo , a condition which requires the density of the galactic subhalo within @xmath46 to exceed the density of the host halo interior to the pericentre @xmath263 of its orbit .    to this end",
    "we adopt the approach of ghigna et al .",
    "( 1998 ) who showed how the condition for survival against tidal stripping translates approximately into @xmath264 .",
    "the above expression for @xmath46 has been tested by the above authors against high resolution n - body simulations , and has been proved to agree with the values of @xmath46 measured in the simulations for all subhaloes except the few on very eccentric orbits ( the latter have measured radii larger than expected partly due to the formation of tidal tails ) .",
    "we average the above relation for @xmath46 over the distribution of pericentres obtained by ghigna et al .",
    "( 1998 ) from n - body simulations , which we fit with a modified lognormal expression ( in the variable @xmath265 with logarithmic mean -1.3 and logarithmic variance 0.6 ) . performing the average yields for @xmath46 the following expression : @xmath266 where the lower limit @xmath267 corresponds to the minimum tidal radius that a galactic subhalo can have without being severely distorted or disrupted .",
    "following bullock , kravstov and weinberg ( 2000 ) , we adopt for @xmath267 the radius of the peak of the galaxy velocity profile . for a navarro et al .",
    "( 1997 ) circular velocity profile @xmath268 holds , where @xmath269 is the concentration parameter of the subhalo , and @xmath270 is the radius where the average density of the subhalo would equal @xmath37 .",
    "the equations relating @xmath269 and @xmath270 with the circular velocity @xmath44 of the subhalo are given by the above authors .",
    "the validity of the above value for @xmath267 has been tested against n - body results by bullock et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "it is easy to recast the relation @xmath271 in terms of density . substituting the relation @xmath272 one obtains @xmath273 so that the ratio of the subhalo to the host halo average densities is given by @xmath274 .",
    "the average over the distribution of pericentres defining the value of @xmath275 yields typical values for such a ratio ranging between 3 and 5 , depending on the concentration parameter @xmath269 of the subhaloes .",
    "note that taking the tidal radius @xmath276 as the limiting radius of the subhaloes is fully appropriate only for subhaloes much smaller than their host halo .",
    "this is the case for the bulk of the population of satellite galaxies ( the one mainly contributing to binary aggregations ) for which our treatment constitutes a valid approximation .",
