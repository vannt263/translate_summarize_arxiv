    "<S> potential technological applications have already been proposed since 1990 @xcite , but the conditions under which this can be realised are not yet clear , neither experimentally nor theoretically . </S>",
    "<S> the bottleneck seems to be the injection of the spin - polarised current from a ferromagnetic metal ( fm ) contact into the sc . </S>",
    "<S> one basic reason for this was revealed by schmidt and collaborators @xcite , who argued that the huge conductivity mismatch of the fm and the sc , in correlation with the much smaller spin - flip mean free path in the fm , will lead to a drastic drop of the spin polarisation of the current in the vicinity of the interface . </S>",
    "<S> there are , in theory , two ways to circumvent the obstacle : the ballistic spin injection and the injection through a spin - selective tunneling barrier . </S>",
    "<S> at least the latter has already been used in praxis with considerable success @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of ballistic spin injection was proposed by grundler @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first - principles calculations @xcite have shown the necessity to consider the full band structure of the fm and sc together with the electronic structure of the interface . </S>",
    "<S> then the difference in symmetry of the fm and sc for the minority - spin wave functions can play the most important role , by essentially disallowing the incoming fm minority electron to pass onto a sc state . </S>",
    "<S> spin polarisations and magnetoresistance ratios of up to the ideal 100% were calculated for fe / gaas(001 ) , fe / znse(001 ) , and fe / inas(001 ) systems .    in parallel to this </S>",
    "<S> , there is also the proposal of rashba @xcite and fert and jaffrs @xcite that a tunneling barrier at the fm / sc interface could solve the problem even in the diffusive regime . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is that a tunneling barrier can be highly spin selective , as shown in tmr junctions , and at the same time provides an extremely high interface resistance ; this combination of properties would lead to spin injection even in the troubling diffusive regime .    in this contribution </S>",
    "<S> we extend our previous work @xcite to the evaluation of interface resistance for majority and minority electrons in fe / gaas and fe / znse ( 001 ) junctions , with or without a tunneling barrier , in the approach developed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and compare to the limits set by the fert - jaffrs theory . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the importance of interface resonances in such junctions .    </S>",
    "<S> schep and collaborators @xcite , working in the approximation of the resistor model , have deduced the resistance of a ballistic interface of area @xmath1 between two bulk regions a ( in our case fe ) and b ( sc ) in which conduction channels are randomly mixed due to diffuse scattering , as @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] here , @xmath3 is the ballistic transmission probability of the interface . </S>",
    "<S> the diffusion is assumed to occur only in the bulk regions . @xmath4 and @xmath5 represent the number of landauer conduction channels in the two bulk regions , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _  they are proportional to the area of the projected fermi surface on the interface plane .    </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the electronic structure of the bulk and interface regions in the local density approximation of density - functional theory , using the kkr green function method , and assuming two independent spin channels . from the green function the ballistic scattering properties of the interface </S>",
    "<S> are obtained using a method equivalent to the landauer - bttiker formalism @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering at the interface is assumed specular , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _  the part of the bloch @xmath6-vector which is parallel to the interface , @xmath7 , is conserved ; the presupposition for this is that the interface is defect - free . </S>",
    "<S> the transmission probability can be viewed then as a function of @xmath7 , and @xmath3 is an integral of @xmath8 over the surface brillouin zone sbz : @xmath9    in order to achieve spin injection , the sc conduction band edge @xmath10 must be slightly lower than the fermi level @xmath11 ; in our calculations we model such a situation by rigidly lowering the sc potential in the region far from the interface . </S>",
    "<S> we use a value of @xmath12 as a typical one for an experimental situation . </S>",
    "<S> the potential close to the interface , up to two monolayers ( ml ) , is determined by the self - consistent electronic structure and the metal - induced gap states . from this point ( </S>",
    "<S> 3rd ml ) on the transition to the bulk - like region would depend on the doping and the exact band offset of the sc , with the possibility of a longer or shorter schottky barrier . </S>",
    "<S> we model the situation by either a gradual lowering of the potential up to the final bulk value , thus describing a schottky tunneling barrier , or by an abrupt lowering of the potential to the final bulk value ; more details are given in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the former situation is relevant for the case of spin injection through a tunneling barrier with an extremely high interface resistance and spin selectivity . as explained in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , for the evaluation of the current spin polarisation the calculation of @xmath8 at @xmath13 is enough for tunneling or thermal spin injection ; for the interface resistance the integration of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq2 ] ) must be employed , but we note that it can be limited within a small circle around @xmath13 , because of the tiny fermi sphere in the sc .    in the semiconductor part , the low value of @xmath14 means that the corresponding fermi sphere is extremely small ; then the conducting channels of the sc are much fewer than the ones in fe , and in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq1 ] ) @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> next , one should compare @xmath16 with @xmath17 . in the case of a tunneling barrier </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath3 is expected to be so small that @xmath16 will be negligible and the interface resistance will be dominated by the ballistic specular scattering . </S>",
    "<S> this remains true even in the absence of a tunneling barrier , because @xmath8 is of the order of @xmath18 for majority spin electrons ( and orders of magnitude less for minority ) @xcite , making @xmath3 of the order of @xmath19 or less .    </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained for fe / znse and fe / gaas are presented in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> in the upper plots the current spin polarisation is shown , as a function of barrier thickness , for all possible terminations of the sc part . </S>",
    "<S> the high degree of polarisation is due to the symmetry mismatch of the incoming minority fe states , as explained in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the values obtained for the polarisation by use of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq2 ] ) are somewhat smaller than at @xmath13 , because at nonzero @xmath7 the symmetry mismatch for minority is not strict .    </S>",
    "<S> in all cases except the se terminated fe / znse system , the current spin polarisation decreases for thicker schottky barriers ; this shows mostly in the zn terminated fe / znse system . </S>",
    "<S> the cause can be traced back to the existence of resonant interface states in the vicinity of the fermi level for the minority spin . as discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , they can contribute to an increase of the tunneling current . </S>",
    "<S> the density of states for the fe / znse interface at @xmath13 is shown in fig .  2 . </S>",
    "<S> for the zn termination , the interface state lies clearly in the vicinity of the fermi level , while for the se termination it lies higher and does not contribute to the conductance . </S>",
    "<S> however , we must note that effects that are not taken into account here , such as lattice relaxations , a different pinning of the band offset , or a finite bias , could move the resonant states away from or onto the fermi level . in the latter case the polarisation </S>",
    "<S> is strongly affected and can even changes sign , if the peak is at @xmath11 .    in the lower plots of fig .  1 , </S>",
    "<S> the interface resistance is presented for various barrier thicknesses . </S>",
    "<S> note the logarithmic scale used for the resistance . for znse </S>",
    "<S> the constant slope reflects the exponential decay of the wave functions within the barrier . for gaas </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic behaviour of an exponential decay presents itself for thicker barriers , because of the smaller band gap of this material .    in order to estimate the range where spin injection with a barrier is most efficient , we take the criterion proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this reads for the case of spin injection and detection via a second sc / fm interface , @xmath20 with @xmath21 the sc resistance ( normalised to interface area ) , @xmath22 its thickness ( between the barriers ) and @xmath23 the spin - flip mean free path . </S>",
    "<S> typically , @xmath21 can be of the order of @xmath24 and @xmath23 of the order of a @xmath25 @xcite . according to the results presented in fig .  1 </S>",
    "<S> , this places the necessary schottky barrier thickness in the range of 70   for znse or 100  for gaas , if @xmath22 is of the order of a @xmath25 .    in conclusion , we have performed ab initio calculations of the transmission probability in fe / znse and fe / gaas spin injection devices taking into account the possibility of a schottky barrier . </S>",
    "<S> we have estimated the corresponding interface resistances for several barrier thicknesses and found relevant barrier thicknesses for efficient spin injection , and shown that resonant interface states can lower the spin injection efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> our presentation is relevant for situations where diffusive scattering is present in the bulk .    </S>",
