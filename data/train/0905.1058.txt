    "these are typically about 3% .",
    "second , the different clusters suffer different amounts of extinction .",
    "correcting for extinction has two effects : it increases the line fluxes and it changes the line ratios .",
    "for instance , a `` typical '' optical depth of @xmath318 would raise the temperature determined from the s(2 ) and s(3 ) lines by about 4% ( @xmath319k ) since the s(3 ) is located in the center of the silicate band and suffers most from extinction .",

    "for the ` lores ' values the aperture was matched to the size of the region ( section  [ seclines ] ) .",

    "we have estimated the extinction using the apparent optical depth in the @xmath59 m silicate feature .",
    "we assume extinction from a foreground screen , which is certainly an over - simplification . however , unlike for starburst galaxies as a whole , it is a reasonable approximation for the extinction toward individual , embedded sscs , where the luminosity is provided by a central stellar cluster which is surrounded by dust and gas clouds and pdrs .",
    "the depth of the @xmath59 m silicate feature was directly measured as the natural logarithm of the ratio of observed flux to the nominal mid - ir continuum at @xmath59 m .",

    "the literature values are compared with our measurements in table  [ tabext ] .",
    "the conversion from @xmath322 to @xmath321 strongly depends on the assumed extinction law . toward the galactic center",
    "there are various estimates : @xmath338 @xcite , @xmath339 @xcite , and @xmath340 @xcite . for the solar neighbourhood @xcite derived @xmath341 , and @xcite calculated @xmath342 . given this broad range of conversion factors ,",
    "we find that the estimates for @xmath322 from baseline fitting agree reasonably well with the other values listed in table  [ tabext ] .    we note that the @xmath322 values indicate less extinction than derived from observations at shorter wavelengths , and the ratio of @xmath343 varies significantly from source to source .",
    "this may be caused by a dilution effect due to the large area covered by the _ irs _ slits .",
    "an extended component of strong mid - infrared continuum emission will decrease the relative depth of the silicate absorption feature .",
    "this effect is likely most predominant for peak  1 .",
    "furthermore , optical methods mainly probe the absorption by graphite - based dust particles , while the mid - ir methods are mainly sensitive to distinct silicate absorption . in the diffuse ism graphite and silicate - based dust",
    "are uniformly mixed and tightly correlated @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite found that in dense clouds with @xmath344 the linear relation between optical and mid - ir estimates breaks down and @xmath322 underestimates the real amount of dust .",

    "chandra detected several x - ray sources near the radio positions of the nuclei of ngc4038 and ngc4039 @xcite .",
    "the x - ray sources identified with the nuclei are both luminous and spatially extended .",
    "the ngc4038 nucleus spectrum is very soft and steep , and consistent with thermal emission by a supernova - driven super - wind , possibly with some contribution by x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "the nucleus of ngc4039 is more luminous in x - rays , but its spectrum also suggests a combination of x - ray binaries and compact supernova remnants @xcite .",

    "the general decrease toward hotter h@xmath3 is also observed individually for both line fluxes of [ ] and [ ] , but is steeper for the latter , resulting in the decrease of radiation hardness in hotter regions .",
    "these findings may , at first , be surprising as one might have guessed that a harder radiation field is more energetic and will thus produce a hotter environment .",
    "our favored explanation is that the older , more evolved clusters had more time to shape the surrounding ism via stellar winds and supernovae , and the surrounding , clumpy dust and gas clouds have evolved into larger entities .",
    "the uv photons from the cluster can penetrate farther into the cloud and provide a more uniform temperature distribution over a larger area .",
    "very young clusters may have hotter gas and dust near their inner shell but are colder at their well shielded outskirts .",
    "this is mainly a geometrical argument , similar to the scenario discussed in section  [ secpahstudies ] .",
    "we also note that the top plot shows the _ relative _ pah strength , normalized by the continuum flux at @xmath20 m .",
    "the absolute pah fluxes , however , show a similar trend as the neon lines , namely stronger emission from regions of colder gas .",
    "this indicates that the hotter regions are more efficient pah emitters .",
    "finally , the bottom plot in fig .  [ figh2threeplots ] shows the star formation rate ( table  [ tablumis ] ) versus the h@xmath3 temperature .",
    "although less significant than in the upper two plots there is a clear trend of lower sfr for hotter regions .",
    "this is consistent with the previous anti - correlation between both hardness and line fluxes  which are expected to be stronger in regions of recent star formation , and the h@xmath3 temperature .",
    "since the sfrs have been derived independently the good agreement with our line diagnostics underlines the reliability of the results .",
    "the fraction of the warm to total molecular hydrogen mass is of particular interest as it provides information on the dominant excitation mechanism and can be compared to other galaxies .",
    "the total molecular hydrogen mass is dominated by the cold component , which is derived from @xmath27co measurements and then converted to h@xmath3 using the standard galactic conversion factor .    for starburst - dominated galaxies @xcite found that the warm h@xmath3 ( @xmath417k ) accounts for about @xmath418% of the total molecular hydrogen mass .",
    "in seyfert galaxies this fraction can be higher ( @xmath419% * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "recently , @xcite reported that the gas properties in the antennae do not deviate significantly from the @xmath420 ratio found for the disk of the milky way , and the conversion from co is thus reasonably accurate .",
    "@xcite used a co to h@xmath53 conversion factor of @xmath421 h@xmath53@xmath407 , and derived a total h@xmath53 mass of @xmath422m@xmath2 , adopted to our distance of 22  mpc .",
    "earlier estimates by @xcite yielded a total h@xmath3 mass of @xmath423m@xmath2 .",
    "the derived masses of warm h@xmath3 are listed in table  [ tablumis ] .",
    "we note that the two independent estimates from different _ irs _ modules , h@xmath3 lines and observing modes agree within 15% . adding up the warm molecular gas masses for the ` hires ' positions in table  [ tablumis ] yields @xmath424m@xmath2 .",
    "if we also account for the more extended `` missed '' gas ( approximately 25% in the s(2 ) line ",
    "section  [ sech2strength ] ) we get @xmath425m@xmath2 . based on the total mass estimate from @xcite",
    "we measure a fraction of warm - to - total molecular gas mass in the antennae of 0.35% .",
    "this ratio needs to be compared to the extreme case of ngc6240 where @xcite found about 15% of the total molecular gas in its warm phase .",
    "however , the antennae appears to have , for its luminosity , an average fraction of warm - to - total molecular gas mass .",
    "these estimates can also be made for individual regions .",
    "the supergiant molecular clouds labelled sgmc  1 , sgmc  2 and ( sgmc  3 + sgmc  4 + sgmc  5 ) by @xcite correspond approximately to our peak  3 , peak  5 , and ( peak  1 + peak  2 ) , respectively . moving both systems to the same distance , we calculate fractions of warm to total gas masses of 0.4% , 0.8% , and 0.6% for the three regions , respectively .",
    "the more localized ratios are somewhat higher than the galactic average , which is not unexpected since the cold h@xmath3 is likely to cover a larger volume .",
    "similar results are obtained from a comparison with the regions ` south clump ' , ` west clump ' , and ` east clump ' in @xcite , which correspond approximately to our ( peak  1 + peak  2 ) , peak  5 , and peak  3 , respectively .",
    "all the observable lines at mid - ir wavelengths originate from quadrupolar rotational transitions .",
    "the rotational levels of h@xmath53 can be populated in various ways : h@xmath3 molecules may form in an excited state @xcite ; x - ray photons from energetic sources like agn or supernova remnants can ionize and heat the gas , which excites the h@xmath3 molecules via collisions with electrons and/or hydrogen atoms @xcite ; fuv photons can pump the h@xmath3 molecules in excited states @xcite ; and excitation via shocks in the ism @xcite . in starburst environments",
    "we can neglect the former two scenarios and concentrate on uv pumping and shock excitation .",
    "uv pumping requires photons with energies @xmath426ev to excite the h@xmath3 molecules , which cascade via vibration - rotational transitions , producing characteristic fluorescent spectra .",
    "shocks are expected to occur on various scales . on small scales ,",
    "shocks from stellar outflows and supernova remnants can excite h@xmath53 @xcite . on larger , galactic scales streaming motions and cloud - cloud collisions , in particular in merging systems have been proposed @xcite .    both fuv pumping and shock excitation",
    "have been shown to play a dominant role in the excitation of h@xmath53 in starburst environments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "pure fluorescent spectra can usually be distinguished from thermalized , shock heated spectra from the relative line strengths .",
    "however , depending on the critical densities , collisional de - excitation can also become important for uv pumped h@xmath53 states , leading to thermalized lower levels .",
    "most of the emission of warm h@xmath53 is likely to come from dense pdrs with densities @xmath427@xmath354 , and we expect that the observed s(0 ) through s(3 ) lines are thermalized @xcite .",
    "the near - ir rotation - vibration transitions 2 - 1 s(1 ) at @xmath428 m and 1 - 0 s(1 ) at @xmath429 m can be used to discriminate between shocks and uv excitation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "their ratio is typically 0.1 in shocked regions ( with the gas in lte at @xmath430  k ) , but @xmath431 for `` pure '' uv fluorescence @xcite .",
    "however , in very dense pdrs ( @xmath432 @xmath354 ) even the near - ir rotation - vibrational lines are not a good discriminant anymore as thermal collisions can transfer the lower - level ( @xmath433 ) populations toward that in lte , and will resemble the ratio observed in shocked regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the observational evidence in the antennae so far is confusing .",
    "@xcite derived 2 - 1s(1 ) / 1 - 0s(1 ) values between 0.15 and 0.34 for peaks  1 , 2 , and 5 .",
    "these values are in the `` grey zone '' between the model values for uv pumping and shocks . however , thermal collisions may lower these ratios , and the presence of high @xmath434-level lines ( @xmath435 ) suggests that fluorescence plays an important role @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived a velocity dispersion between star clusters of @xmath436kms@xmath25 from _ stis _ spectroscopy and concluded that high - velocity cloud - cloud collisions can not be the dominating starburst mode in the antennae .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite found evidence for cloud - cloud collisions near the strongest mid - ir peak , but @xcite concluded that massive shock heating , either due to supernova remnants or due to cloud collisions , is not likely the dominant heating source for the sgmcs in the overlap region .    a starburst system of particular interest for comparison may be stephan s quintet ( ngc7317/7318b) a compact group of four strongly interacting galaxies with a likely foreground galaxy .",
    "@xcite reported on the discovery of an almost `` pure h@xmath3 line spectrum '' with unusually strong and broad h@xmath3 lines , resembling the spectra of shocked gas seen in galactic supernova remnants .",
    "the total mass of warm h@xmath3 was determined to be @xmath437m@xmath2 , about 40% more than what we measured in the antennae .",
    "@xcite attributed the powerful h@xmath3 emission from stephan s quintet to a large - scale shock wave , resulting from a high - velocity galaxy collision .",
    "the evidence for this claim is manifold : the unusually broad line width of @xmath438kms@xmath25 , the relative strength of the h@xmath3 s(0 ) - s(5 ) lines as indicated in the excitation diagram ( their fig .",
    "3 ) , and the absence of pah - dust features and very low excitation ionized gas tracers .",
    "so far , the strongest support for large - scale shock excitation in the antennae came from _ iso _ data @xcite , which showed exceptionally strong h@xmath3s(3 ) emission from the overlap region .",
    "in addition , the detected emission appears also spatially displaced from the known starburst regions ( fig .",
    "[ figh2haas ] ) .",
    "@xcite interpret these two findings as combined evidence for pre - starburst shocks that arise from neutral hi cloud - cloud collisions .    as discussed in section  [ sech2strength ]",
    "our _ irs _ observations disagree with the measurements by @xcite .",
    "we find that the h@xmath53 emission appears to be reasonably well correlated with the starburst activity in the southern part of the overlap region .",
    "the only exception may be the nucleus of ngc4039 for which  to our knowledge  no published near - ir h@xmath3 flux measurements exist , but the spectra of @xcite and @xcite suggest that the ratio is very small and lies within the ` shocked ' regime .",
    "based on the near - ir lines of h@xmath531 - 0 s(1 ) and br@xmath335 , @xcite argued that the surface brightness at the nucleus of ngc4039 is too high to be explained by uv excitation , and favoured c - shocks .    in summary",
    ", we find no evidence for large - scale pre - starburst shocks due to hi cloud - cloud collisions .",
    "we also note that we have seen none of the strong evidence for large - scale shocks , that has been reported for stephan s quintet by @xcite , in the antennae . in the overlap region",
    "the h@xmath3 emission agrees well with the starburst activity , and leaves both fuv photons and local shocks , e.g. from supernovae , as origin for h@xmath3 excitation . in the southern nucleus ,",
    "from which 45% of the h@xmath3s(3 ) is detected , shocks appear to be the dominant trigger .",
    "further observations at higher resolution , e.g. by _ jwst _ , are necessary to get a clearer picture of the complex processes in this interacting system .",
    "we observed the antennae galaxies ( ngc4038/39 ) with the infrared spectrograph on board of the spitzer space telescope to study the properties of the ism and the most luminous super - star clusters in this prototype merger system .",
    "we obtained low - resolution ( @xmath439 ) spectral maps of the entire central area and high - resolution ( @xmath440 ) spectra of six infrared - luminous regions and the two galactic nuclei .",
    "the high signal - to - noise spectra allow for a detailed study of fine - structure lines , pahs , silicates and molecular hydrogen in the range between @xmath441 m .",
    "both nuclei of ngc4038 and ngc4039 are surrounded by regions of moderately active star formation .",
    "while the nucleus of ngc4039 appears more active in terms of the [ ] , [ ] and h@xmath3s(3 ) emission lines , we can rule out the presence of an agn in both nuclei , based on the lack of [ ] emission and the low [ ] / [ ] ratio .",
    "generally , the older super star clusters are associated with softer radiation , as measured by the [ ] / [ ] ratio .",
    "the by far hardest and most luminous radiation originates from two compact clusters ( our peaks  1 and2 ) in the southern part of the overlap region .",
    "the tracers of softer radiation and pah emission ",
    "typical for photo - dissociation regions  are spatially extended throughout and beyond the overlap region .    from the slope of the continuum emission we found that peaks  1 and 2 have the highest dust temperatures while peaks  3 and 5 have the lowest . however , the differences are subtle and in agreement with the average spectral slope and diversity of starburst galaxies .",
    "the total infrared luminosity of our six ir peaks plus the two nuclei is @xmath382l@xmath2 . from the ir luminosities we derived the star formation rates for the individual regions , which range between 0.2 and 2  m@xmath2yr@xmath25 with a total of 6.6  m@xmath2yr@xmath25 .",
    "we found weak evidence for suppressed pah emission from regions with harder ( [ ] / [ ] ) emission .",
    "however , there is a clear trend that regions with stronger ( i.e. , harder _ and _ intenser ) radiation fields show reduced pah strength .",
    "since the hii  regions and pdr interfaces can not be spatially resolved at the distance of the antennae , aperture effects play an important role in the interpretation of the results .",
    "we found no evidence for pah grain size variations from the comparison of the @xmath402 m and @xmath51 m pah features .",
    "to first order , the pah features trace each other very well .",
    "however , we find some evidence for spatial variations in the @xmath52 m /@xmath51 m ratio , which could be attributed to pah ionization effects .",
    "the h@xmath3 lines are among the strongest emission lines in the antennae .",
    "the emission is rather confined to the region around the nucleus of ngc4039 and the southern , more active , part of the overlap region .",
    "we find a total line flux of @xmath442  w@xmath407 in the s(3 ) line .",
    "this is a factor five less than previous claims by @xcite based on _ isocam - cvf _ data . with an s(3 )",
    "line luminosity of @xmath443l@xmath2  the luminosity ratio between the warm molecular gas ( as measured by the h@xmath3 lines ) to the total fir emission is @xmath444 , a value similar to that found in many starburst and ultra - luminous infrared galaxies .",
    "we did not find the tight correlation between the h@xmath3 line and the pah strength that was seen by @xcite on larger scales in the sample of _ sings _ galaxies .",
    "apart from the general `` smoothing effect '' when averaging over larger regions local shocks from supernovae are likely to contribute to the discrepancy .",
    "we derived a temperature of the warm h@xmath3 , averaged over the individual star forming regions , of @xmath6k .",
    "pdrs which have stronger pah emission relative to the continuum emission have warmer molecular gas .",
    "interestingly , the hardness of the radiation field anti - correlates with the h@xmath3 temperature .",
    "we explain this by the pdr geometry : older clusters had more time to shape their surroundings ; the uv photons can penetrate farther into the cloud and provide a more uniform temperature distribution , while young clusters may have hotter gas and dust near their inner shell but appear cooler at their well shielded outskirts . we calculated a total mass of warm h@xmath3 in the antennae of @xmath445m@xmath2 .",
    "the fraction of warm to total h@xmath3 gas mass is 0.35% globally and varies between 0.4% and 0.8% for the individual supergiant molecular clouds .",
    "we find no evidence for large - scale pre - starburst shocks due to hi cloud - cloud collisions . whether the h@xmath3 emission is due to local shocks or uv pumping",
    "can not be unambiguously determined from our data . in the overlap region",
    "the h@xmath3 emission agrees well with the starburst activity , and leaves both fuv photons and local local shocks , e.g. from supernovae , as origin for h@xmath3 excitation . in the southern nucleus ,",

    "the h@xmath53 molecule exists in two states : ortho - h@xmath53 with parallel nuclear spins ( odd  @xmath446 ) , and para - h@xmath53 with anti - parallel spins ( even  @xmath446 ) . in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte )",
    "the ortho - to - para ratio is 3 for @xmath447k @xcite .",
    "the s(0 ) and s(2 ) lines are from para - h@xmath53 , while the s(1 ) and s(3 ) lines are from ortho - h@xmath53 .",

    "<S> using the infrared spectrograph on the spitzer space telescope , we observed the antennae galaxies obtaining spectral maps of the entire central region and high signal - to - noise @xmath0 m spectra of the two galactic nuclei and six infrared - luminous regions .    </S>",
    "<S> the total infrared luminosity of our six ir peaks plus the two nuclei is @xmath1l@xmath2 , with their derived star formation rates ranging between 0.2 and 2m@xmath2/yr , with a total of 6.6m@xmath2/yr . </S>",
    "<S> none of the typical mid - infrared tracers of agn activity is detected in either nucleus of the system , excluding the presence of an dust enshrouded accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> the hardest and most luminous radiation originates from two compact clusters in the southern part of the overlap region , which also have the highest dust temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> pah emission and other tracers of softer radiation are spatially extended throughout and beyond the overlap region , but regions with harder and intenser radiation field show a reduced pah strength .    the strong h@xmath3 emission is rather confined around the nucleus of ngc4039 , where shocks appear to be the dominant excitation mechanism , and the southern part of the overlap region , where it traces the most recent starburst activity . </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity ratio between the warm molecular gas ( traced by the h@xmath3 lines ) and the total far - ir emission is @xmath4 , similar to that found in many starburst and ulirgs . </S>",
    "<S> the total mass of warm h@xmath3 in the antennae is @xmath5m@xmath2 , with a fraction of warm to total h@xmath3 gas mass of about 0.35% . </S>",
    "<S> the average warm h@xmath3 temperature is @xmath6k and appears anti - correlated with the radiation field hardness , possibly due to an evolution of the pdr morphology . </S>",
    "<S> the previously reported tight correlation between the h@xmath3 and pah emission was not found but higher total pah emission to continuum ratios were found in pdrs with warmer gas . </S>"
