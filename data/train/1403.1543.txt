    "the frequencies of the charge - sensitive vibrations of bedt - ttf are known , and probing of charge distribution in the insulating state is a well established technique.@xcite quite recently , it has been independently suggested@xcite that vibrational spectroscopy can also be fruitfully exploited to analyze charges and charge fluctuations in metallic systems .",
    "the idea is borrowed from nuclear - magnetic - resonance spectroscopy , where it is well known that the line shape relevant to two chemical species in equilibrium depends on the difference in frequency between the two absorption energies and the speed of exchange . in this",

    "we have adapted the model to optical transitions , and tested it on the charge - sensitive infrared active c = c antisymmetric stretch of bedt - ttf . here",
    "we extend the model to raman spectroscopy , and present a full comparative analysis of the temperature evolution of the spectra of the above mentioned superconducting and metallic salts .",
    "the studied compounds were prepared as described in the literature.@xcite the infrared ( ir ) spectra have been already published,@xcite and are reproduced here for comparison .",
    "the raman spectra have been collected from the @xmath6 crystal face with a renishaw 1000 microspectrometer , with 647.1 nm excitation from a lexel krypton laser , with 0.1 mw power at the sample .",

    "we can therefore apply the symmetric dimer model to carry out the spectral predictions and to analyze the effects of the electron - molecular vibration ( _ e - mv _ ) interaction.@xcite in a centro - symmetric dimer , the vibrations of each molecular unit combine in - phase and out - of - phase . in the @xmath10 molecular symmetry",
    ", the 72 normal modes of each bedt - ttf molecule are classified as : 18 @xmath11 ( r ) + 18 @xmath12 ( r , ir ) + 18 @xmath13 ( r , ir ) + 18 @xmath14 ( r , ir ) , where r and ir indicate raman and infrared activity , respectively.@xcite in the dimer , we then have 72 @xmath15 ( r ) and 72 @xmath16 ( ir ) vibrations .",
    "the in - phase @xmath15 modes are completely decoupled from the charge - transfer ( ct ) interaction within the dimer,@xcite and we expect weak raman intensity for modes originating from the in - phase combination of @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 molecular vibrations . in other words ,",
    "the raman spectra of the dimer will be dominated by the 18 totally symmetric ( @xmath11 ) vibrations in the molecular symmetry .",
    "the ir activity of the out - of - phase combination of the molecular vibrations belonging to the @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 species will be substantially unaltered in the dimer : the @xmath12 modes will be polarized along the @xmath17 long molecular axis , namely approximately along the @xmath18 crystal axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig : beta_sc1 ] ) , the @xmath14 ones perpendicularly to the molecular planes ( approximately along the @xmath11 crystal axis ) , and the @xmath13 perpendicularly to the former two ( approximately along @xmath8 ) . on the other hand , the out of phase combinations of the @xmath11 modes interact with the electronic system : they present a downward shift with respect to the corresponding raman active in - phase combination , and borrow intensity from the ct electrons . both the frequency shift and the intensity borrowing",
    "are connected to @xmath19 , the zero - frequency electronic susceptibility , and to @xmath20 , the square of the _ e - mv _ coupling constants.@xcite the _ e - mv _ coupled modes will be polarized along the stack ( @xmath11 crystal axis ) , like the @xmath14 molecular vibrations .",
    "we now turn attention to the interaction between the aa@xmath9 and bb@xmath9 dimers .",
    "it is formally an `` interstack '' interaction , but actually the hopping integral between the stacks is larger than that along the stack.@xcite we shall continue the analysis by taking the dimer as a supermolecular entity , although the results are not different from those obtainable by starting from the separated molecules . in the following , when we refer to modes of @xmath12 symmetry , for instance , we actually mean  the combination of molecular @xmath12 modes within the dimer ( either in - phase or out - of - phase , depending on the context ) .",
    "since the dimers are inequivalent , we can speak about approximately in - phase and out - of - phase coupled dimer vibrations , with corresponding pseudo davydov splitting.@xcite in any case , the spectral prediction concerning the non - totally symmetric ( in the molecular symmetry ) vibrations are not substantially altered with respect to those seen above for a single dimer ( or stack ) .",
    "for example , the @xmath12 modes we shall be concerned with in the following , are weak in raman , and appear in the ir spectra polarized along the @xmath18-axis ( almost perpendicular to @xmath8 ) .",
    "they will not exhibit any appreciable splitting , since anti - parallel transition dipole moments cancel each - other.@xcite on the other hand , important spectroscopic effects are expected for the @xmath11 modes , following the `` interstack '' ct interaction , due to the _ e - mv _ coupling . in the analysis , we can follow again a dimer - like approach . in this case , however , the dimer is non - symmetric : according the x - ray data , the a and b stacks are inequivalent and bear a different molecular charge.@xcite the consequences of _ e - mv _ coupling on the ir spectra of such kind of systems has been first analyzed by m. j. rice _",

    "the spectral consequences of _ e - mv _ coupling in a non - symmetric dimer differ from those in a symmetric dimer .",
    "in particular , there is no in - phase and out - of - phase coupling between monomer - degenerate modes .",
    "this has an important consequence for the mutual exclusion rule for the raman and infrared activity : all the @xmath11 modes of the bedt - ttf moieties are active ( with the same frequency ) in raman and in ir , hence both the spectra are affected by the _",

    "the zero - frequency electronic susceptibility depends on the ct excitation frequency , @xmath24 , and on the molecular ionicity @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and is maximum for equally charged molecules ( the symmetric dimer ) .",
    "we finally remark that whereas the consequences of _ e - mv _ interaction on the ir spectral features have been accurately reproduced in terms of the appropriate model,@xcite very little is known about the expected raman intensities , also because these are connected more to the intra - molecular electronic structure .    in the following",
    ", we shall mainly deal with the charge - sensitive molecular vibrations , namely the three c = c stretching modes , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 ( known respectively as @xmath29 , and @xmath30 in the @xmath31 molecular symmetry).@xcite the @xmath28 mode is not coupled to the electronic system .",
    "it may appear with weak intensity in the raman spectrum , but is well detectable in the ir spectra polarized along the @xmath18-axis . in case",
    "the a and b dimers ( on adjacent stacks ) bear different charges , it will appear as a doublet , with the same polarization .",
    "the @xmath11 modes are instead affected by the _ e - mv _ interaction , connected to the interaction between the inequivalent dimers .",

    "the interpretation of this distinctive second feature remains uncertain;@xcite it is not clear whether and how it is associated with the presence of the mixed phase , containing fluctuating and frozen co. on the other hand , the bottom panel of fig .  [ fig : deltarho_vex ] demonstrates that the intensities of the @xmath82  band and the @xmath28 mode that is associated to the frozen co regime below @xmath71  k increase simultaneously .",
    "this is a strong indication that the two features have the same origin .",
    "hence we associate the low - frequency mode with oscillations of the frozen co. since this mode is polarized along the @xmath11-axis , namely along the stacks , the frozen co is established along the stack . in other words the inversion symmetry present in the stacks is actually broken , and the charge disproportionation involves the a and a@xmath9 ( and in analogy b and b@xmath9 ) molecules along the stack ( fig .",
    "[ fig : beta_sc1 ] ) .",
    "this symmetry breaking is not detected by the x - ray analysis below @xmath83  k,@xcite but it is well known that x - ray detects long range order only , whereas vibrational spectroscopy probes the local environment . in this interpretation , the low - frequency phonon would be associated with oscillations of a charge - ordered string along the @xmath11-axis , whereas we recall that the fluctuations presumably occur between the charge - ordered stripes on different stacks , namely , along the @xmath8-axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig : beta_sc1 ] ) .    in the light of the above data",
    ", we suggest that below approximately 200  k two different , almost orthogonal , types of charge order start to develop in @xmath75sc : a fluctuating co between a and b stacks , leading to the broad bands interpreted in terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bandshape ] ) , and frozen co strings along the stacks , leading to the low - frequency mode at @xmath82  .",
    "this picture is strongly reminiscent of the coexistence of different sorts of charge modulation observed by diffuse x - ray in @xmath84-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cs@xmath85(scn)@xmath86 ( @xmath85 = co , zn).@xcite udagawa and motome@xcite have attributed this coexistence to the competition between nearest - neighbor electron - electron interaction , causing a regular charge order , and fermi surface nesting , leading to a commensurate charge - density wave .",
    "a similar scenario might be applicable to the present case , since the frozen co appears to be related to an intermolecular phonon .",
    "diffuse x - ray investigation as a function of temperature on both @xmath0-sc and @xmath0-m amended by appropriate modeling is required to confirm this idea .",
    "it is instructive to take into consideration two other salts in the series @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1sf@xmath2rso@xmath3 , i.e. @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1sf@xmath2ch@xmath1so@xmath3 ( hereafter @xmath0-i),@xcite and @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1sf@xmath2chfcf@xmath1so@xmath3 ( hereafter @xmath0-mi ) . @xcite the two salts are isomorphous with @xmath0-sc and @xmath0-m , but have very distinct electrical properties : @xmath0-i is semiconductor already at room temperature , whereas @xmath0-mi has a metal - to - insulator transition around @xmath87  k. unfortunately , infrared data have been collected only in the conducting plane , and raman spectroscopy has been measured at room temperature only . from the optical conductivity@xcite and from a reanalysis of the raman data presented in ref .",
    ", we deduce that @xmath0-i is in a full co state , with @xmath88 to 0.6 . on the other hand ,",
    "the room temperature raman spectrum of @xmath0-mi in the charge sensitive region is practically identical to that of @xmath0-m,@xcite suggesting a fluctuating co regime with very similar @xmath40 .",
    "the metal - insulator transition of @xmath0-mi has been ascribed to electron localization due to anion ordering .",
    "it is plausible to assume that the anion ordering also induces a co on the cation .    to summarize , at room temperature the four salts of the @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1sf@xmath89so@xmath3 family all display a charge disproportionation @xmath40 between 0.4 and 0.6 , most probably between the a and b stacks ( cf .",
    "[ fig : beta_sc1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath0-i is in a fully charge - ordered state , whereas the other three salts are in a charge - fluctuation regime , with metallic conductivity . by lowering the temperature ,",
    "@xmath0-m remains in the fluctuating regime , whereas @xmath0-mi undergoes a phase transition around @xmath87  k accompanied by charge localization .",
    "finally , below 200  k @xmath0-sc exhibits a `` mixed phase '' , with the coexistence of fluctuating and frozen regimes .",
    "this coexistence persists down to the superconducting phase .",
    "( bedt - ttf)@xmath1sf@xmath89so@xmath3 family .",
    "@xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1sf@xmath2ch@xmath1so@xmath3 ( denoted @xmath0-i ) is a charge - ordered insulator , @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1sf@xmath2chfcf@xmath1so@xmath3 ( @xmath0-mi ) undergoes a metal - insulator transition at 180  k , @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1sf@xmath2ch@xmath1cf@xmath1so@xmath3 ( @xmath0-sc ) is a superconductor at @xmath79  k , and @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1sf@xmath2chfso@xmath3 ( @xmath0-m ) remains metallic down to low temperatures . ]",
    "based on the above scenario , we propose the empirical phase diagram presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagra1 ] .",
    "the pressure axis refers to chemical pressure , and could be replaced by the intermolecular coulomb interaction @xmath90 , running in opposite direction .",
    "this diagram can be compared with that theoretically proposed for the @xmath0 and the @xmath84 ( bedt - ttf)@xmath91 structures@xcite and also applicable to the @xmath92-(bedt - ttf)@xmath91 compounds.@xcite our empirical diagram is very similar , the conductivity of the metallic phase is typical of a `` bad metal '' , and presumably due to charge fluctuations between the bedt - ttf units . however",
    ", we also find that between the metallic phase and the charge - ordered insulating phase , there is a region of coexistence , where the system is still metallic , but regions of frozen charge order develop .",
    "the region of coexistence is rather intriguing , and of course can not be predicted within mean field theories . on the other hand ,",
    "the coexistence is not due to macroscopic domains at the borderline between two phases , since the temperature interval is rather large , and perfectly reproduced in different runs and measurements .",
    "as we have already stated , the coexistence is likely due to the competition between two different interactions , driving towards different charge - ordered states .",
    "in a comprehensive study we have compared the temperature dependence of the raman and infrared active charge - sensitive vibrations of bedt - ttf in @xmath0-sc and @xmath0-m salts .",
    "we could delineate the interplay of charge order , charge fluctuations and superconductivity in these two - dimensional quarter - filled electron systems .",
    "two distinct charge - ordered states could be identified in @xmath0-sc : one fluctuating and the other static ; they are almost orthogonally polarized and coexist below 200  k down to the critical temperature @xmath79  k. this `` mixed phase '' , not found in @xmath0-m , is likely the results of the competition / cooperation of different interactions .",
    "it then becomes clear that very weak additional interactions may tune the system towards one or the other ground state . in this scenario , it is uncertain whether or not the `` mixed phase '' is essential to the development of superconductivity , since so far this phase has been found only in @xmath0-sc , and not in other superconductors with either @xmath0 or in the similar @xmath84 or @xmath92 structure .",
    "but of course it has not been expressly looked for .",
