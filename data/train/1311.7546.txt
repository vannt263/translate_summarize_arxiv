    "electronic transport in graphene is sensitive in particular to local defects such as vacancies or adsorbates [ 1 - 5 ] .",
    "these defects are interesting in the context of functionalization which aims at controlling the electronic properties by attaching groups of atoms to graphene [ 6 - 13 ] .",
    "therefore a theoretical understanding of conductivity in the presence of such defects is needed .",
    "so far the case of resonant local defects as attracted much attention because these defects strongly scatter electrons and therefore affect deeply the electronic transport properties .",
    "yet most of the studies are done in the standard nearest neighbor hopping model of graphene . in particular in a recent work [ 12 ] we detailed some universal regimes of transport close to the dirac point .",
    "the aim of the present study is to analyze the effect of hopping beyond nearest neighbors in the graphene plane . as we show",
    "the universal regime presented in the previous work [ 12 ] still exist but their domain of existence in term of electron concentration for example is affected which may be important for precise comparison with experiments .",

    "the constant @xmath11 is fixed to have a second neighbors interaction equal to @xmath12 [ 13,10 ] .",
    "we consider that resonant adsobates ( such as h , oh , ch@xmath13 ... ) can create a covalent bond with some carbon atoms of the graphene sheet .",
