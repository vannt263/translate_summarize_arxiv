    "the study of the critical properties of physical systems with bond randomness on phase transitions is a quite active field of current interest in equilibrium statistical physics @xcite .",
    "one of the central importance here is to answer the question whether the critical exponents ( of a homogeneous pure magnet ) change on the addition of quenched impurities and , if so , how do they change ? replying to this question ,",
    "it was first stated already two decades ago that if the specific heat critical exponent @xmath3 of a pure system is positive , then a quenched disorder is a relevant perturbation at the second - order critical point and it causes changes in critical exponents .",
    "this statement is known as the harris criterion @xcite .",
    "furthermore , following the earlier work of imry and wortis @xcite , who argued that quenched disorder could smooth _ first - order _ phase transitions and thus produce the _ second - order _ phase transitions , the introduction of randomness to pure systems undergoing a first - order transition has been comprehensively considered @xcite .",
    "the theory was initially numerical checked with the monte carlo ( mc ) method by chen , ferrenberg and landau ( cfl ) @xcite , who studied the 8-state random - bond potts model with a bimodal self - dual distribution . on the other hand the experimental evidence has been found that , for the order - disorder phase transitions of absorbed atomic layers on two - dimensions , the critical exponents are changed from the original universality class of the 4-state potts model on the addition of disorders @xcite .",
    "however , no modification is found when the pure system belongs to the ising universality class @xcite .",
    "recently such disordered systems are extensively studied by examining how a phase transition is modified by quenched disorder coupling to the local energy density @xcite , where use of intensive mc simulations is often helpful @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xmath4-state random - bond potts ferromagnet ( rbpf ) is an interesting framework in the mc research to study the influence of impurity on pure systems .",
    "for @xmath5 such randomness acts as a relevant perturbation , and for @xmath6 it even changes the nature of the transition from first to second order . in table 1",
    "we list the magnetic scaling index @xmath2 of the 2d 8-state rbpf obtained by different groups . here a disorder amplitude @xmath7 , defined by the ratio of the _ strong _ to _ weak _ coupling ( distributed according to the bimodal distribution ) in the range @xmath82 - 20 appears to be adapted to a numerical analysis and gives a good estimate of the disordered fixed point exponents @xcite .",
    "a recent work of olson and young @xcite used a specially _ continuous _ self - dual probability distribution of the disoreded bonds @xmath9 for the boltzmann factor @xmath10 , and performed a mc study of multiscaling properties of the correlation functions for several values of @xmath4 .",
    "their results are very interesting to examine the universality class of the rbpf .",
    "cardy and jacobsen @xcite studied the rbpf based on the connectivity transfer matrix ( tm ) formalism @xcite , and their estimates of the critical exponents lead to a continuous variation of @xmath11 with @xmath4 , which is in sharp disagreement with the mc results by cfl(see table 1 ) .    0.1 cm    .",
    "magnetic exponent @xmath11 estimated by different groups for the 2d 8-state rbpf . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have , for the first time , introduced the trinary distribution for the 2d rbpf with multi - disorder amplitudes to study its critical behavior by the std method . in the mc simulation",
    "the dynamic scaling behavior is verified and the power - law behavior is used to estimate both the dynamic and static exponents as a function of the disorder amplitudes @xmath12 . it is found that the values of exponents @xmath0 and @xmath11 vary continuously with the disorder amplitudes , and they violate the ising - like universality .",
    "furthermore the values of dynamic exponent @xmath1 are larger than those for systems without disorders and they increase with the strength of disorder amplitudes \\{@xmath13 } for the systems i : @xmath14 , @xmath15 and iii : @xmath16=@xmath15 in table 3 .",
    "curves for the disorder amplitudes \\{@xmath16=5 , @xmath17=8 } , \\{@xmath16=8 , @xmath17=10 } and \\{@xmath16=10 , @xmath17=10 } are almost parallel each other , but it dose not for the \\{@xmath16=1 , @xmath17=5 } curve . , width=317 ]     curves for the disorder amplitudes \\{@xmath16=5 , @xmath17=8 } , \\{@xmath16=8 , @xmath17=10 } and \\{@xmath16=10 , @xmath17=10 } are almost parallel each other , but it dose not for the \\{@xmath16=1 , @xmath17=5 } curve . ,",
    "width=317 ]    on the other hand , for the systems ii where 2/3 bonds are strongly coupled with different amplitudes @xmath18 , they seem to have been located at a `` random '' regime where their values of the critical exponents @xmath11 and @xmath1 are nearly independent of disorder amplitudes within the error bars , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . by comparing these results to @xmath1=2.23(4 ) and @xmath11=0.182(5 ) for the @xmath16=@xmath17=10 in iii , we could argue that , after @xmath21 ( equivalent to @xmath16=1 , @xmath22 in i ) it will pass the `` crossover '' region to the random regime from other type , i or iii , of the disordered systems , so that @xmath1 and @xmath11 will be nearly constants . in fig.6 the @xmath23 curves for the disorder amplitudes \\{@xmath24 } ,",
    "\\{@xmath25 } and \\{@xmath26 } are almost parallel each other , which shows that the values of exponent @xmath11 are nearly same for these disordered systems . in conclusion ,",
    "our simulation verifies that second order phase transitions are induced .",
    "then the results show evidence that the dynamic universality class of the trinary rbpf should not belong to that of the ising model , as inferred by jacobsen and cardy @xcite . from the work we find it rather encouraging to apply the short - time dynamic mc to simulate the scaling and critical dynamics of disordered spin systems .",
    "we will pursue this field to explore the logarithmical slow dynamics @xcite .",
