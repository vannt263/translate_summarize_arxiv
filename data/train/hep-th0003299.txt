    "theories with extra dimensions where our four - dimensional world is a hypersurface ( three - brane ) embedded in a higher - dimensional spacetime and at which gravity is localised have been the subject of intense scrutiny since the work of randall and sundrum @xcite . the main motivation for such models comes from string theory where they are reminiscent of the hoava - witten solution @xcite for the field theory limit of the strongly - coupled @xmath0 heterotic string .",
    "the randall  sundrum ( rs ) scenario may be modelled @xcite and @xcite by coupling gravity to a scalar field and mapping to an equivalent supersymmetric quantum mechanics problem .",
    "a static metric is obtained with a warp factor determined by the superpotential .",
    "a generalisation to non - static metrics was considered by bintruy , deffayet and langlois who modelled brane matter as a perfect fluid delta - function source in the five - dimensional einstein equations @xcite . however , this resulted in non - standard cosmology in that the square of the hubble constant on the brane was not proportional to the density of the fluid .",
    "other cosmological aspects of `` brane - worlds '' have been considered in @xcite .",
    "+ in this letter we investigate cosmological solutions of five - dimensional gravity coupled to a scalar field sigma - model . in much of the current literature",
    "it is assumed that such scalars depend only on the fifth dimension and that the target space metric is of euclidean signature .",
    "by contrast , we consider a non - compact sigma - model and allow the scalars to depend on time as well as the fifth dimension , which we take to be infinite in extent .",
    "we also include a perfect fluid with energy - momentum tensor @xmath1 and equations of state @xmath2 . a family of warp factors that includes both the original rs solution and the self - tuning solution of kachru , schulz and silverstein @xcite is found .",
    "the fifth radius is time - dependent .",
    "we find that the fluid exists provided @xmath3 .",
    "conventional cosmology is also obtained . + it may appear somewhat unnatural to have an indefinite target space metric since some of the scalars then have `` wrongly - signed '' kinetic terms .",
    "however , such scalars have been considered before in the literature . within the context of @xmath4 gravity",
    "they are descended from vector fields after dimensional reduction along a timelike direction of a higher dimensional `` two - time '' theory @xcite and @xcite , whilst in @xmath5 dimensions they are interpreted as axions after dualisation of a ( @xmath61)-form field strength @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "thus , our paper should be interpreted in the light of these works .",
    "we shall present our calculations in @xmath7-dimensional spacetime and only quote analogous results for the @xmath8 case .",
    "the action for gravity coupled to two scalars is : s  = d^4x dr ( ^(5)_matter ^(5)_gravity ) , where : ^(5)_matter & = & - ^ _ i ^ _ j g^ij ( ) g^(5 ) _ - u ( ) - v ( ) ( r ) , + ^(5)_gravity & = & r. here , @xmath9 is the pull - back of the five - dimensional metric @xmath10 to the ( thin ) domain wall taken to be at @xmath11 .",
    "the wall is represented by a delta function source with coefficient @xmath12 parametrising its tension .",
    "we take @xmath13 .",
    "the `` correctly - signed '' scalar , @xmath14 , may be interpreted as the dilaton and the `` wrongly - signed '' scalar , @xmath15 , as an axion .",
    "( it is possible to consider a non - trivial coupling between the two  for example , @xmath16 is discussed in @xcite . )",
    "+ we assume a separable metric with flat spatial three - sections on the wall : [ metric ] ds^2 = - e^-a(r ) dt^2 + e^-a(r)g(t)(dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 ) + f(t)dr^2 .",
    "this is a natural generalisation of the 4@xmath17 flat robertson - walker metric to a rs context .",
    "+ given the above ansatz , it is not unreasonable to assume scalars of the form [ dilaton ] ^i ( t , r ) = a^i ( t ) b^i ( r ) .",
    "since @xmath18 can be considered as coordinates on the target spacetime we must require them to be linearly independent .",
    "this imposes the condition ( ) 0 .",
    "the schwarz inequality @xmath19 follows as a corollary .",
    "+ we also make the ansatz that both the potentials @xmath20 and @xmath21 are of liouville type ( see , for instance , @xcite ) : [ pot ] v ( ) & = & v_0 e^_i ^i , + u ( ) & = & u_0 e^_i ^i .",
    "the energy  momentum tensor for the scalar fields is : t^(0 ) _ & = & _ ^i _ ^j g_ij - g _ ( _ ^i _ ^j g_ij g^ + u ( ) ) +   + & & - v ( ) ( r ) g^(4)_ab ^a _ ^b_. we introduce a perfect fluid via its energy  momentum tensor : ^ _ = ( - , p , p , p , p ) with @xmath22 the density and @xmath23 and @xmath24 the pressures in the @xmath25 and fifth dimensions respectively . the preferred coordinate system ( [ metric ] )",
    "is taken as the rest frame of the fluid .",
    "+ einstein s equations @xmath26 reduce to : [ 1 ] & & + + - - - aa ^2 - ^2 e^-a ( + p ) = 0 , +   + [ 4 ] & & aa ^2 ^2 e^-a= 0 , +   + [ 5 ] & & ( a^2 - a^ ) bb ^2 f",

    "this requires that the density and pressures are each of the form @xmath27 times a function of @xmath28 .",
    "we are interested in solutions with @xmath29 .",
    "this requires @xmath30 , as can be deduced from ( [ 9 ] ) .",
    "+ the equations of motion for the scalar fields [ eqm ] ^2 ^j g_jk ( r ) = 0 result in the following bulk equations [ 12 ] ( f^1/2g^3/2 ) & = & 0 , + [ bulk ] b_i ( 2 a^^- ^ ) f _ i u_0 & = & 0 , and the jump condition : [ jump ] _ 0^+",
    "= _ i f^1/2 v((t,0 ) ) .",
    "equation ( [ 9 ] ) implies that we can make the following choice : [ scalar1 ] ^(r ) & = & a^(r ) , + [ scalar2 ] ( t ) & = & - . inserting ( [ scalar1 ] ) into ( [ 8 ] ) gives @xmath31 as : [ u ] u = - a^2 ( 1 - bb ) .",
    "we can express the domain wall potential @xmath32 as @xmath33 .",
    "equation ( [ 5 ] ) can then be rewritten in the form [ rdep ] a^ - 2 bb a^2 - v_0 ( r ) = 0 , yielding the following options for @xmath34 and @xmath35 : if @xmath36 , we find @xmath37 , where @xmath38",
    ". then @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40 is the rs1 solution and @xmath41 is the rs2 solution , as described in @xcite .",
    "if @xmath42 , we find @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 if @xmath46 and @xmath47 are both positive , then this represents the self - tuning solution of kachru , schulz and silverstein @xcite . as observed in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "if @xmath48 there are naked singularities at @xmath49 whose interpretation is currently of some debate @xcite .",
    "the above forms for @xmath20 and @xmath21 are consistent with ( [ pot ] ) if @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "it can now be verified that ( [ bulk ] ) is equivalent to ( [ rdep ] ) in the bulk , whilst ( [ jump ] ) yields no further information .",
    "the equation of motion ( [ 12 ] ) implies that [ psi ] ( t ) = f(t)^-1/2 g(t)^-3/2 .",
    "this assumes @xmath52 is not constant , otherwise ( [ 12 ] ) is trivially satisfied due to ( [ scalar2 ] ) .",
    "we find that @xmath53 and @xmath54 are related via the following equation : [ fg ] = g(t)^-3/2 , where @xmath55 + adding equations ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) gives : [ c1 ] ^2 2 g g ^2 g^2 e^-a ( p ) = 0 . on the otherhand , using ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 12 ] ) in ( [ 1 ] ) we obtain : [ c2 ] ^2 2 g g 2 ^2 g^2 e^-a ( p ) = 0 .",
    "consequently , the relation [ ttwiddle ] p = p , may be deduced .",
    "+ we now assume the equation of state @xmath56 or , equivalently , @xmath57 . from ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ scalar2 ] ) , the density @xmath22 is given by [ dense ] ( t , r ) = ( - ) , so that ( [ c1 ] ) may be alternatively expressed as : [ g2 ] 2 ( 1- ) = 0 . taken together with ( [ fg ] ) , equation ( [ g2 ] ) defines the cosmology .",
    "+ we seek either power law , @xmath58 , or exponential ( inflationary ) , @xmath59 , solutions of ( [ g2 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding solutions for @xmath54 are @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively .",
    "the exponents @xmath62 and @xmath63 are non - zero but otherwise arbitrary .",
    "+ there are two cases to consider : @xmath64 .",
    "+ from ( [ dense ] ) , it follows that in the exponential case the density is positive provided @xmath65 ( independently of @xmath63 ) . on the otherhand ,",
    "the density is positive in the power law case provided @xmath66 . as shown in the figure below",
    ",    the minimum of @xmath67 is @xmath68 so we can achieve positive density for all @xmath63 and @xmath62 if we choose @xmath69 . if @xmath70 , positive density is achieved only for a limited range of @xmath62 . ] . defining the scale factor and hubble constant as per usual by @xmath71 and @xmath72 , it is easy to see that we obtain conventional cosmology , @xmath73 , for both the power law and exponential cases",
    ". + solution of ( [ g2 ] ) leads to the above inequalities for @xmath74 becoming strict equalities which , in turn , leads to the vanishing of the density .",
    "hence , the fluid only exists if @xmath75 .",
    "the only essential difference between the 5 + 0 case and the 4 + 1 case considered above is that @xmath76 flips sign .",
    "this changes the sign of @xmath22 in ( [ dense ] ) so that the density is positive if @xmath77 . similar considerations ( see previous footnote ) apply as to the range of @xmath62 .",
    "we note in passing that the scalar field equations of motion , ( [ eqm ] ) , imply that @xmath78 ( and conversely off the brane only ) .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the fluid equation of motion @xmath79 is automatically satisfied . in this sense",
    ", the same results in the bulk can be obtained from einstein s equations and @xmath79 .",
    "+ it may seem a bit unusual to consider a non - static fifth radius ( some authors @xcite give arguments against rolling dilatons ) .",
    "we would like to present an intuitive argument in favour of our choice .",
    "consider a five - dimensional spacetime with robertson  walker metric : [ one ] ds^2 = -dt^2 g(t)(dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 + dr^2 ) .",
    "the @xmath80-space is isotropic .",
    "change coordinates via dr = e^-a(r ) dr and perform a conformal transformation of the metric : ds^2 e^-a(r ) ds^2 .",
    "then the metric becomes : ds^2 = - e^-a(r ) dt^2 + e^-a(r)g(t)(dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 ) + g(t ) dr^2 @xmath81the warp factor of the conformal transformation violates the symmetry between the four spatial coordinates .",
    "zeldovich @xcite gives arguments that any universe will become isotropic with time and non - isotropic expansion causes particle creation . to avoid particle creation in the bulk",
    "one could restore isotropy by `` untwisting '' the fifth dimension with another warp factor , i.e. , replacing @xmath54 by another function of time , @xmath53 , such that the four spatial dimensions are still isotropic .",
    "+ within our model we can still have scalar fields depending on brane coordinates if we require a static fifth radius .",
    "in this case we need to introduce viscosity into the fluid by making @xmath76 non - diagonal .",
    "the sum of the energy - momentum tensors of the scalar fields and the fluid should then amount to a purely diagonal tensor .",
    "+ from our initial separability assumptions and from equation ( [ dense ] ) it is clear that if the warp factor decreases with @xmath82 then the density grows without limit as we go off the brane and the fluid is smoothly distributed over the entire extra dimension . + considering a thick brane ( in lorentzian or riemannian signature ) within our model",
    "is straightforward .",
    "thickening the brane requires only smearing the delta function in the domain wall potential by expressing it as a limit of some delta - sequence , for example , @xmath83 , where @xmath84 parametrises the brane thickness .",
    "+ from ( [ 1 ] )  ( [ 9 ] ) it is evident that under the transformation @xmath85 the potentials @xmath20 and @xmath21 change sign but otherwise the analysis is unmodified .",
    "thus one can make the fifth dimension timelike rather than spacelike .",
    "such a possibility was alluded to in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "+ finally , it would be interesting to see if our model(s ) can be embedded in five - dimensional lorentzian or euclidean supergravity , as has recently been done for the minimal randall ",
    "sundrum model in 4 + 1 dimensions @xcite , @xcite .",
