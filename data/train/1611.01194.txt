    "it is not difficult to generate a random density matrix from the entire set @xmath6 of quantum states of size @xmath7 using a matrix @xmath8 of the ginibre ensemble of complex square random matrices of order @xmath7 , as the matrix @xmath9 is positive and normalized and forms thus a legitimate random quantum state @xcite .",
    "however , as the relative volume of the subset of ppt states decreases exponentially with the dimension @xcite , is is not efficient to generate random points in the entire set @xmath6 of states of size @xmath10 and to check a posteriori , if the ppt property is satisfied .",
    "the goal of this work is to analyse the set of ppt states by generating a sequence of random points from this set according to the flat measure . in this way we are in position to analyse the level density of random ppt states and to show the difference with respect of the hilbert ",

    "that analytical analysis of the set of ppt states is not an easy task , as this set does not enjoy the symmetry with respect to unitary transformations .",
    "however , based on the fact that the level density of partially transposed quantum states is asymptotically described by the shifted semi  circle law @xcite and making use of the level density of for the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) with constraints for the spectrum @xcite , we are in position to conjecture the level density which describes well numerical results obtained by sampling the set of ppt states .",

    "one finds the longest interval belonging to the set which passes through the initial point and is parallel to this direction and jumps to a random point drawn from this interval .",

    "furthermore , we studied the level density of the partially transposed operators @xmath106 with eigenvalues @xmath107 . for the states sampled from the entire set @xmath94 ,",

    "[ two - qubits]a .",
    "it is known that for @xmath109 systems only a single eigenvalue @xmath106 can be negative and it is not smaller than @xmath110 @xcite , so one sees a single peak of the density @xmath111 containing the negative eigenvalues . for large systems the asymptotic density for the transposed states",

    "\\(a ) ( b )    consider now a bipartite case of size @xmath127 , for which the notion of partial transpose is defined .",
    "it is was first shown by aubrun @xcite that level density of the partially transposed bipartite random states , written @xmath128 , asymptotically tends to the shifted semicircle law of wigner , @xmath129 with support @xmath130 $ ] .",
    "up to a linear shift , @xmath131 , this distribution is that of the ensemble of random hermitian matrices of gue ",
    "see e.g. @xcite .",
    "an extended model of random gue matrices with spectrum of the rescaled eigenvalue restricted to a certain interval @xmath132 $ ] was analyzed by dean and majumdar @xcite .",
    "they derived an explicit family of probability distributions , labeled by a parameter @xmath133 , which determines the position of the ` hard wall barrier ' for the corresponding coulomb gas model , @xmath134 where the upper edge @xmath135 of the support of @xmath136 reads @xmath137    since partial transpose is a volume preserving involution , the level density averaged over the set of ppt states can be approximated by the density of states obtained from the shifted semicircle law of aubrun ( [ ssc ] ) , by imposing the restriction that all eigenvalues are non - negative .",
    "the approximation consists in an assumption that the ensemble of partially transposed density matrices asymptotically coincides with the shifted gue .",
    "taking distribution ( [ distdba ] ) , setting @xmath138 and normalizing the rescaled variable @xmath139 so that the expectation value is set to unity as required , @xmath140 , we arrive at the normalized probability distribution @xmath141 supported in @xmath3 $ ] .    to demonstrate that this distribution can describe asymptotic level density of ppt states we need to rely on numerical computations . in the case of a larger bi  partite system of size @xmath10 the probability of finding a random ppt state decays exponentially with the dimension @xcite .",
    "therefore the simplest approach to get a ppt state by generating random states from the entire set @xmath6 and verifying , whether its partial transpose is positive becomes ineffective .",
    "however , the ` hit and run ' algorithm , advocated in this work , is still suitable for the case of the set of ppt states .",
    "for any two points inside the set it is easy to find where the line joining them hits the boundary , provided the dimensionality @xmath10 is low enough .",
    "we have found the numerical procedure to be stable for @xmath142 .",
    "level density for the subset of ppt states for bipartite @xmath0 system is shown in fig .",
    "[ figppt ] .",
    "the number of random points generated , equal to @xmath143 for @xmath123 and @xmath144 for @xmath124 , was found to give reliable results .",
    "characteristic finite  size oscillations visible for @xmath123 become less pronounced for @xmath124 . as for this dimension",
    "the exact expression ( [ pn ] ) is already close to the marchenko ",
    "pastur distribution , our data obtained for the @xmath145 system support the conjecture that the level density for the ppt states is asymptotically described by the distribution ( [ eq : sp ] ) .",
    "\\(a ) ( b )    observe that the right edge of the support of @xmath146 is smaller than the upper bound for the mp distribution , @xmath147 .",
    "hence our numerical results support the conjecture that the operator norm of the ppt states is asymptotically almost surely smaller than the norm of a generic state taken from the entire set @xmath120 , which typically behaves as @xmath148 .    in view of these numerical results , it is natural to conjecture that as @xmath149 , the spectral distribution of @xmath150 is different from the distribution obtained from an uniform sampling on all states . to prove such a statement",
    "one could show that there exists @xmath151 such that @xmath152 , as this would result in differentiating mathematically the uniform distribution on all states from the uniform distribution on ppt states .",
    "however , despite our efforts , we were not able to prove this result and we leave it as an open question .",
    "it is slightly easier to deal with these sets of quantum states , which are invariant with respect to unitary transformations .",
    "there is a natural notion of @xmath153 ( absolute positive partial transpose ) , which means that a state satisfies the @xmath154 property regardless of its ( global ) unitary evolution . in the case of @xmath155 systems",
    "this property is equivalent to absolute separability @xcite , i.e. separability with respect to any choice of a two dimensional subspace embedded in @xmath156 , which defines both subsystems .",
    "hence the property of appt of a given state can not depend on its eigenvectors but is only a function of its eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "this feature holds also for higher dimensions and in some cases the boundary of this set are known @xcite .",
    "interestingly , although for higher dimensions the set of ppt states has much larger volume then the set of separable states @xcite , it is conjectured that the set of absolutely separable states and appt states do coincide @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "proposition 8.2 from @xcite concerning the largest eigenvalue of a quantum state belonging to the set of appt states implies that the support of the level density for the states of this set is asymptotically bounded by @xmath157 .",
    "observe that this fact is consistent with our observations concerning the generic behavior of the norm of a ppt state .",
    "note that the above questions of separating distributions through their typical largest eigenvalues can be partly addressed in the more general context of sampling from a uniform purification .",
    "it is known @xcite that if the ancilla space has the same dimension as the state space , this sampling method gives the uniform distribution .",
    "it is also interesting to study other regimes , where the ancilla space is bigger than the state space .",
    "aubrun proved in @xcite that the ppt property holds with probability @xmath46 as @xmath149 if , for @xmath151 the ancilla space is of dimension at least @xmath158 .",
    "intuitively , a bigger ancilla space means that the sampling is more concentrated around the maximally mixed state . for even larger ancillas",
    "the generated states belong to the set of appt states , as it was showed in @xcite that the threshold is @xmath159 and that this is essentially optimal .",
    "unsurprisingly , this shows that the set of appt states is much smaller than the set of ppt states .",
    "but the problem of comparing these sampling probabilities with the uniform ppt distribution or the uniform appt distribution remains difficult to achieve formally .",
    "in this paper we analysed a universal algorithm to generate random points inside an arbitrary compact set @xmath13 in @xmath11 according to the uniform measure .",
    "any initial probability measure @xmath160 transformed by the corresponding markov operator converges exponentially to the invariant measure @xmath161 , uniform in @xmath13 .",
    "explicit estimations for the convergence rate are derived in terms of the ratio @xmath162 between the radii of the sphere inscribed inside @xmath13 and the sphere outscribed on it .",
    "thus the algorithm presented here can be used in practice to generate , for instance , a sample of random quantum states . in the case of states of a composed quantum system",
    ", one can also generate a sequence of random states with positive partial transpose .",
    "sampling random states satisfying a given condition and analyzing their statistical properties is relevant in the research on quantum entanglement and correlations in multi - partite quantum systems .",
    "a standard approach of generating random points from the entire set of quantum states with respect to the flat measure @xcite and checking a posteriori , whether the partial transpose of the state constructed is positive , becomes inefficient for large dimensions , as the relative volume of the set of ppt states becomes exponentially small @xcite .",
    "obtained numerical results show that the level density for random states covering uniformly the subset of the ppt states differs considerably from the hilbert - schmidt level density corresponding to the entire set @xmath163 of mixed states of a bi - partite system . making use of the shifted semicircle law of aubrun ( [ ssc ] ) , which describes the asymptotic density of partially transposed states , and imposing the restriction that all the eigenvalues are non - negative we arrived at the probability distribution ( [ eq : sp ] ) .",
    "this distribution was compared with the level density obtained numerically with the ` hit and run ' algorithm applied for the set of ppt states for the @xmath0 system for @xmath164 . the larger dimension the better agreement of the numerical data with the distribution ( [ eq : sp ] ) , so is tempting to conjecture that it describes the level density of the ppt states in the asymptotic limit .",
