    "after the discovery of the soft gamma repeaters and anomalous x - ray pulsars @xcite , a model of these sources was proposed according to which they are neutron stars with a very strong magnetic field ; these _ magnetars _ would have a surface field as large as @xmath0 g , and internal fields about ten times larger @xcite .",
    "however , a clear picture of the structure , dynamics and evolution of magnetars is still missing .",
    "for instance we do not know whether the toroidal components of the field prevail on poloidal ones and how intense they are .",
    "consequently , we do not know how large the deformation induced by the magnetic field on the star is , an information which is essential if one is interested in the gravitational wave emission of these sources .",
    "a deeper knowledge of the structure of strongly magnetized neutron stars would also help understanding various astrophysical processes involving magnetars ( intense activity in the x- and gamma- spectra , quasi - periodic oscillations , eventually gamma - ray bursts ) .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite , to be referred to as paper i hereafter , we constructed stationary models of non rotating neutron stars endowed with a strong magnetic field , in the framework of general relativity ( gr ) . in these models",
    "the poloidal field extends throughout the star and in the exterior , whereas the toroidal field is confined into a torus - shaped region inside the star , where the field lines are closed .",
    "it is worth reminding that these _ twisted torus _",
    "configurations have been found to be a quite general outcome of dynamical simulations of the early evolution of magnetized stars , in the framework of newtonian gravity .",
    "furthermore , due to magnetic helicity conservation , they appear to be stable on dynamical time - scales @xcite , are not significantly affected by rotation @xcite , and do not depend on the initial angle between the rotation and the magnetic axes @xcite .    in lander & jones twisted torus configurations",
    "were studied in newtonian gravity ; the maximal relative strenght of the toroidal and poloidal components and the induced stellar deformation were evaluated using a polytropic equation of state ( eos ) to model neutron star matter .    in paper",
    "i , we studied the twisted torus configurations in gr using a more realistic eos .",
    "we considered a relation between the poloidal and the toroidal components of the field which is linear in the flux function , and estimated their ratio by determining the configuration of minimal energy at fixed magnetic helicity , under the assumption that the contribution of the @xmath1 multipoles is minimum outside the star .    in the present paper , we reconsider the above assumptions : the higher multipoles contribution is not assumed _ a priori _ to be minimum outside the star , and we allow for a more general parametrization of the relation between toroidal and poloidal fields .",
    "we determine the configuration of minimal energy at fixed magnetic helicity , and evaluate the stellar deformations induced by the twisted torus field by solving the perturbed einstein equations including all relevant higher order multipoles .    as in paper",
    "i , the magnetized fluid is described in the framework of ideal mhd , which is accurate only in the first few hours of the star life , when the crust is still liquid and the matter in the core has not yet undergone a phase transition to the superfluid state . since the characteristic alfvn time is of the order of @xmath2 s , the magnetized fluid could reach a stationary state while the matter is still liquid and not yet superfluid is still allowed to evolve throughout the star on a dynamical time - scale @xcite . ] .",
    "the magnetic field induces quadrupolar deformation on the stellar shape and , as we shall later show , for magnetic fields as high as those observed in magnetars this deformation would be large ; when the crust forms , it would maintain this deformed shape .",
    "the magnetic field would subsequently evolve on time - scales of the order of @xmath3 years due to dissipative effects like ohmic decay , ambipolar diffusion and hall drift @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ ttmfc ]",
    "we generalize the twisted torus magnetic field configurations introduced in paper i by dropping the assumption that the contribution from the @xmath1 multipoles outside the star is minimum , and using a more general parametrization of the functional relation between toroidal and poloidal fields . in section [ ell ]",
    "we determine the stellar deformations induced by the magnetic field . in section [ conclusions ]",
    "we draw our conclusions .",
    "in this section we briefly describe the formalism and the basic equations we solve to determine the twisted torus magnetic field configuration ; furthermore , we discuss the modifications introduced with respect to the analysis carried out in paper i.      we assume that the magnetized star is non - rotating , stationary and axisymmetric .",
    "the magnetized fluid is described in the framework of ideal mhd , in which the effects of electrical conductivity are neglected .",
    "furthermore , we assume a vacuum exterior .",
    "we follow the same notation and conventions as in paper i. we treat the magnetic field as a stationary , axisymmetric perturbation of a spherically symmetric background with metric @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are solutions of the unperturbed einstein equations ; the unperturbed four - velocity is @xmath7 .    to model neutron star matter in the core we use the akmal , pandharipande , ravenhall eos , named apr2 @xcite , and the glendenning eos named gnh3 @xcite ;",
    "the crust is modeled using a standard eos which accounts for the density - pressure relation in the crustal region , but not for its elastic properties ( see benhar , ferrari & gualtieri ) . for a neutron star with mass @xmath8",
    ", the apr2 star has a large compactness ( @xmath9 km ) , whereas the compactness of the gnh3 star is small ( @xmath10 km ) .    as shown in colaiuda _",
    ", an appropriate gauge choice allows to write the potential @xmath11 , in terms of which the maxwell tensor is written ( @xmath12 ) , as @xmath13 the two functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 describe the toroidal and the poloidal field , respectively . here",
    "@xmath11 is considered as a first order quantity , @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath17-component of euler s equation yields @xmath18 . using maxwell s equations and neglecting higher - order terms",
    "one finds the integrability condition @xmath19 which implies that @xmath20 is a function of @xmath21 : @xmath22 the function @xmath23 represents the ratio between the toroidal and poloidal components of the magnetic field and characterizes the kind of field configuration we want to model .",
    "for instance , configurations with @xmath24 constant have been studied in ioka & sasaki , colaiuda _ et al .",
    "_ , haskell _ et al .",
    "if the space outside the star is assumed to be vacuum , the toroidal field , and consequently @xmath25 , must vanish for @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the neutron star radius ; in this case , the choice @xmath24 constant yields an inconsistency , unless one assumes that surface currents cancel the toroidal field outside the star , or imposes that the constant @xmath25 assumes very particular values .",
    "these problems do not arise with the twisted torus configurations ( see for instance paper i or lander & jones , yoshida _ et al . _ ) since the toroidal field is confined in a region inside the neutron star , and the magnetic field is continuous everywhere .",
    "for these configurations the function @xmath28 is continuous , and has the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the value of function @xmath21 , which describes the poloidal field , on the stellar surface , and @xmath31 is the heaviside step function . if @xmath28 satisfies eq .",

    "these equations are solved by imposing the following boundary conditions .",
    "( i ) the functions @xmath41 have a regular behaviour at the origin ; an asymptotic expansion of the gs equation shows that this implies @xmath42 ( ii ) the functions @xmath41 and their derivatives @xmath43 are continuous across the stellar surface where they match with the solutions in vacuum , which are known in an analytical form ( see paper i ) ; therefore , the ratios @xmath44 computed at @xmath45 in terms of the interior and exterior numerical solutions must coincide .",
    "( iii ) the overall normalization of the field is fixed by requiring the @xmath46 component of the magnetic field at the pole to be @xmath47 g ; this corresponds to @xmath48 km .",
    "once the form of the function @xmath28 and the number @xmath49 of multipoles we want to include have been assigned , the field is determined when we fix @xmath50 arbitrary constants : the @xmath49 constants @xmath51 and the two constants @xmath35 , @xmath36 defined in eq .",
    "( [ defc0c1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath52 of them are determined by imposing the boundary conditions . in paper",
    "i the last constant was fixed assuming that the contribution of higher - order multipoles outside the star is minimum , i.e. by minimizing the function @xmath53 , for @xmath54 . in this paper",
    "we remove this assumption , thus exploring a larger parameter space , and fix the last constant by finding the configurations which are energetically favoured ( this is discussed in detail in the next section ) .    to this purpose , we minimize the total energy at fixed magnetic helicity . as shown in paper i , this is equivalent to minimize the ratio @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the magnetic helicity @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the mass - energy increase due to the perturbation that the magnetic field induces on the spherical star .",
    "this quantity is determined in terms of the functions which characterize the far field limit of the spacetime metric . finally , we compute the ratio of the magnetic energy stored in the poloidal field to the total magnetic energy , @xmath59 .",
    "the equations to determine these quantities are given in appendix [ hme ] .",
    "the gs system of equations admits two particular classes of solutions : the symmetric ( with respect to the equatorial plane ) solutions , with vanishing even - order components ( @xmath60 ) , and the antisymmetric solutions , with vanishing odd - order components ( @xmath61 ) . in paper",
    "i the choice of minimizing the @xmath1 multipole contribution led naturally to symmetric solutions , i.e. those with @xmath62 .",
    "it is worth noting that even - order multipoles contribute to the energy but not to the magnetic helicity ; therefore , any solution minimizing energy at fixed magnetic helicity corresponds to a vanishing antisymmetric component . since in this paper",
    "we still look for minimal energy configurations , we shall consider only symmetric solutions .",
    "in addition , as in paper i , we shall restrict to multipoles with @xmath63 ( the relevance of @xmath64 multipoles is discussed in paper i , section 5.3 ) .          as explained in the previous section , since we remove the condition of minimal contribution from higher order multipoles , the boundary conditions are not sufficient to fix all the parameters of the problem and we are left with a free arbitrary constant .",
    "we choose @xmath36 as a `` free '' parameter .    in this section",
    "we shall choose the function @xmath28 as in paper i : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a real parameter .",
    "in the next section we shall consider a more general form of @xmath28 compatible with eq .",
    "( [ gentwth ] ) .",
    "the constant @xmath66 determines the ratio between the amplitudes of the toroidal and poloidal fields .",
    "thus , we minimize the energy with respect to two parameters : @xmath36 and @xmath66 .",
    "we proceed as follows . for",
    "assigned values of @xmath66 :    * we solve the equations for the @xmath67 s for different values of @xmath36 * we compute @xmath55  the quantity to minimize  for the corresponding configurations * we compute the quantity @xmath68 , which represents the surface contribution of the multipoles higher than @xmath46 .    in fig .",

    "this mhm configuration corresponds to the point @xmath72 on the curve plotted in fig .",
    "[ hm ] .",
    "since we now drop the mhm condition , the minimum of @xmath55 occurs for a different value of @xmath68 ( point @xmath73 in fig .  [ hm ] ) , which corresponds to the energetically favoured configuration for @xmath69 km@xmath70 . for an assigned value of @xmath56 , the relative variation of the total energy of the configuration @xmath73 with respect to @xmath72 is of the order of 13% .",

    "we plot @xmath55 for selected values of @xmath66 , and compare the different profiles .",
    "we have explored the parameter space @xmath74 ( equivalent to @xmath75 ) , finding that the function @xmath76 has a minimum ( @xmath77 ) for @xmath78 km@xmath70 and @xmath79 km .",
    "it is worth reminding that the @xmath46 contribution is @xmath48 km .",
    "we shall refer to this configuration as the minimal energy 1 ( me1 ) configuration .    in fig .",
    "[ comparhm ] we compare the profiles of the tetrad components of the magnetic field for the mhm and the me1 configurations . we see that , whereas for the mhm configuration @xmath80 and @xmath81 are significantly different from zero throughout the star , for the me1 configuration , obtained with no assumption on the relative strengths of the different multipoles for @xmath82 , these field components are strongly reduced near the axis .",
    "conversely , the toroidal component @xmath83 has a similar behaviour in both configurations .",
    "the two panels of fig .",
    "[ comparhm ] illustrate how the magnetic field rearranges inside the star when the mhm condition is removed .",
    "the situation can be explained as follows .",
    "the magnetic helicity @xmath56 can be written as @xmath84 therefore , @xmath56 vanishes if either @xmath85 , i.e. the poloidal field vanishes , or @xmath86 , i.e. the toroidal field vanishes . in the twisted torus model",
    "the toroidal field is zero in the inner part of the star , therefore @xmath56 receives contributions only from the magnetic field in the region where @xmath87 . since in that region",
    "the field components of the mhm and me1 configurations are similar , these configurations have nearly the same magnetic helicity @xmath56 . on the other hand , the energy @xmath58 receives contributions from the field components throughout the entire star , and these contributions are not vanishing in the region where @xmath88 .",
    "when we minimize the function @xmath55 in the me1 configuration , the @xmath1 multipoles , which were kept minimum in the mhm configuration , do not change @xmath56 significantly , but they change @xmath58 , and since we require @xmath58 to be minimum , they combine as to reduce the field in the inner region of the star .      in this section",

    "the minimal energy configuration is obtained with the choice ( [ zeta ] ) , and @xmath111 the ratio of the poloidal energy to the total magnetic energy inside the star , for this configuration , is @xmath105 .",

    "in this section we compute the quadrupole deformation induced by the magnetic field for the twisted torus configurations previously obtained . to this purpose",
