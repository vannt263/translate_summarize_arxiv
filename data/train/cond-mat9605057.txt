    "<S> an ising spin glass ( isg ) with random near neighbour interactions does not order above zero temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> implicitly this has been taken to mean that two dimensional isgs with ordering at finite temperatures do not exist . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that this assumption is unfounded by exhibiting a family of 2d ising systems with a different set of interactions , which show spin glass ordering at finite temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the physical properties of these 2d isg systems ressemble closely those of standard isgs in higher dimensions .    </S>",
    "<S> consider a square lattice of ising spins with second nearest neighbour ferromagnetic interactions of strength @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this clearly consists of two inter - penetrating but non - interacting square sublattices which will each order ferromagnetically at the onsager curie temperature @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> now introduce random near neighbour interactions of strength @xmath2 . at low temperatures </S>",
    "<S> when the spins are frozen , each sublattice will exert effective random fields on the spins of the other sublattice . </S>",
    "<S> it is well established @xcite that a 2d ising ferromagnet breaks up into finite size domains under the influence of a random field , however small . at low temperatures </S>",
    "<S> each sublattice of the present system will then be ordered in randomly arranged ferromagnetic domains of finite size . </S>",
    "<S> however in contrast to the true 2d random field ising system , here the `` effective random fields '' will average to zero at high temperatures , so we can expect a critical temperature @xmath3 separating a high temperature paramagnetic regime ( with the autocorrelation function @xmath4 relaxing to zero at long time @xmath5 ) from a low temperature regime where @xmath4 does not go to zero , corresponding to ordering with a non - zero edwards - anderson order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> below we will show numerical evidence that for small and moderate @xmath6 , @xmath3 is non - zero . in the low temperature state </S>",
    "<S> there is no long range ferromagnetic order so the system is certainly not a ferromagnet ; we will choose to call the frozen state a `` spin glass '' , although random systems with short range ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic order are often referred to as `` cluster glasses '' in an experimental context .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the established numerical techniques for determining the ordering temperature in ferromagnets and spin glasses is through finite size scaling using the binder cumulant @xcite . for sets of samples of different sizes @xmath7 , </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuations of the autocorrelation function @xmath4 in equilibrium are recorded . </S>",
    "<S> the binder cumulant at temperature @xmath8 is defined as : @xmath9 and is dimensionless ; for sets of samples with fixed @xmath7 values , the series of curves @xmath10 as a function of temperature intersect at the ordering temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we have carried out simulations using heat bath dynamics and sequential spin by spin updates on samples up to @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> 500 samples were used at each size for each value of @xmath6 and standard precautions were taken to assure that thermal equilibrium was achieved @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we show in figure [ gl ] the @xmath12 data for three values of @xmath6 and it can be seen that for the smallest value there is a clear intersection point . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath13 the @xmath12 curves come together without any clear fanning out at lower temperatures , but we consider that the meeting point represents the freezing temperature here too . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath14 it is hard to say if the curves will intersect above @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> ( very similar behaviour with almost unobservable fanning out below @xmath3 is seen in 3d isgs @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the behaviour of the freezing temperature as a function of @xmath6 is shown in the inset of figure [ cv ] ; at small @xmath6 , @xmath3 extrapolates back to the onsager @xmath16 , and with increasing @xmath6 , @xmath3 drops as might be expected , because for high enough @xmath6 we will recover the 2d random interaction near neighbour isg with its zero temperature ordering . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that the limiting value of @xmath6 for non - zero @xmath3 is in the region of 1.0 .    in conventional second order transitions </S>",
    "<S> @xmath17 has a universal value for all systems in a given class ; for instance for the 2d ising ferromagnet the magnetism binder parameter @xmath18 @xcite and we find the autocorrelation binder parameter @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> we can note in figure ( [ gl ] ) that @xmath20 changes with @xmath6 so for the present systems of 2d isgs universality is not obeyed . </S>",
    "<S> for the range of @xmath6 that we have studied , @xmath20 appears to be tending regularly to a value near 1 as @xmath3 is tending to zero . at still higher @xmath6 values @xmath21 will presumably tend to 0.83 , which is the standard 2d @xmath22 isg zero temperature value @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we can note that a closely related non - random 2d ising system , having first and second neighbour interactions with regular frustation , shows non - universality of critical exponents when a control parameter representing the ratio of the two interaction strengths is varied @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is also strong evidence for non - universality of the critical exponents in canonical isgs at dimension 3 and above @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have not yet estimated the values of the critical exponents for the present family of 2d isgs .    </S>",
    "<S> once the existence of finite ordering temperatures established , we can carry out simulations to measure the standard physical properties for these 2d isgs in order to compare with those of other isgs . in figure ( [ cv ] ) </S>",
    "<S> we show the specific heats for the same three values of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that the specific heats show broad maxima at temperatures higher than the respective ordering temperatures , and smooth featureless behaviour through the freezing transition . </S>",
    "<S> this is precisely what is observed for standard isgs in dimension 3 @xcite , 4 and 5 @xcite and appears to be a universal characteristic of the isg transition below the upper critical dimension . </S>",
    "<S> for the present systems the maximum of the specific heat corresponds to a saturation of the ferromagnetic correlation length in each sublattice as the sample is cooled ; the ordering process can be thought of as consisting of first the formation of finite size ferromagnetic domains , and then of a freezing at a lower temperature where the domain movements are hindered by the random near neighbour interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> another parameter accessible from simulations is the damage spreading @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> damage spreading is measured numerically by using heat bath dynamics and applying the same random update parameter at each update step to two replicas of the same system ; @xmath23 is defined as the normalised hamming distance between the two replicas ( i.e. the fraction of spins having opposite orientations ) at long times when this protocol is applied . while ferromagnets have @xmath24 down to @xmath16 , standard isgs have been found to show non - zero @xmath23 until temperatures well above @xmath3 @xcite ; it has been pointed out that for isgs in dimension 3 and 4 , as the temperature is reduced @xmath23 tends to 1/2 at a temperature very close to @xmath3 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied damage spreading in the present 2d isgs . </S>",
    "<S> two random initial replicas of each 2d system were chosen ; these replicas were annealed independently to thermal equilibrium at each temperature , and then the damage spreading procedure was applied for long times . </S>",
    "<S> the results , figure ( [ dam ] ) , show that the damage spreading temperature @xmath25 where @xmath23 first becomes non - zero is much higher than @xmath3 , and that in each case on cooling @xmath23 tends to 1/2 . for @xmath26 </S>",
    "<S> this temperature is indistinguishable from the tg we have estimated from the binder cumulant data . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath23 then remains equal to 1/2 for lower temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the behaviour is similar but less clear cut for the other two values of @xmath6 ( the lowest temperature points may be slightly low because of the very long times needed to achieve complete thermal equilibrium ) . </S>",
    "<S> the general behaviour of the damage spreading parameter appears to be the same in these 2d isgs as in isgs in dimensions 3 and 4 . </S>",
    "<S> the use of the empirical criterion @xmath27 gives a convenient method to check @xmath3 values .    </S>",
    "<S> an advantage of the present systems over conventional isgs is that `` snapshots '' of the instantaneous configurations of the spins are informative because we are in dimension 2 . </S>",
    "<S> we show in figure ( [ snap ] ) two snapshots of the same @xmath26 system at temperature @xmath28 , well below @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the images were produced by slowly cooling two independent random replicas of the same system by successive steps to the final temperature . </S>",
    "<S> as could be expected there are four types of domains : if we call one sublattice a and the other b then the domains are a up b up ( white ) , a up b down ( white / black checkerboard ) , a down b up ( black / white ) and a down b down ( black ) . here </S>",
    "<S> the domain sizes are typically 25 by 25 spins . </S>",
    "<S> ( the simulations confirm that the typical domain size below @xmath29 gets smaller as @xmath6 is increased ) . </S>",
    "<S> for this sample at this temperature the two configurations are almost frozen ; averaging over a further 10000 monte carlo steps per spin ( mcs ) only blurs the domain frontiers somewhat . to a good approximation </S>",
    "<S> the images then represent two gibbs states of the system . by inspection </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that the two states are neither quasi - identical , nor are they quasi - mirror images of each other with all the spins reversed . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed structures of the two states are quite different suggesting that there are an infinity ( or at least a large number ) of alternative gibbs states for this isg . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion appears to be incompatible with the two ground state image which has been proposed heuristically for isgs @xcite but the phase space could ressemble that of the parisi solution of the infinite range sk model @xcite .    in conclusion , we have demonstrated that 2d isg systems with non - zero freezing temperatures exist . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown data for a certain number of parameters for a new family of 2d isgs where we have found that the observed behaviour is very similar to that seen in simulations on standard isgs in dimension 3 . </S>",
    "<S> a more comprehensive study of the 2d isgs and a detailed comparison with results from higher dimensions should establish what properties are always necessarily associated with spin glass ordering and should help understanding of the spin glass phenomenon in general . as far as experimental comparisons are concerned , it might be worth reconsidering the data on 2d isg materials without making the a priori assumption that the ordering temperature is necessarily zero .    finally , the general philosophy behind the present study may help to resolve a long standing paradox . </S>",
    "<S> real three dimensional spin glass materials where the spins can be considered to be basically heisenberg show well defined non - zero freezing temperatures ; on the other hand in numerical work and on theoretical grounds it appears that heisenberg spins with random near neighbour interactions should not show a freezing transition at a finite temperature @xcite ( but it should be noted that with vector spins chirality should also play a role @xcite and that a simulation of a heisenberg spin glass with rkky interactions shows a finite @xmath3 @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> now we have just seen that if we have a set of random near neighbour interactions only , a 2d ising system has no finite temperature ordering , but the system can be a spin glass with a finite @xmath3 if there are both random and non - random interactions . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps the same rule applies to 3d heisenberg systems . </S>",
    "<S> it may well be that all real life heisenberg spin glasses have both random and non - random interactions ( and so in a sense might be classified as `` cluster glasses '' @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus even in the canonical cumn alloys , the short range magnetic ordering which has been observed with neutrons @xcite may be essential for the spin glass transition to occur at a finite temperature . </S>"
