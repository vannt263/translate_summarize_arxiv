    "clusters of galaxies , the largest virialized systems known , are key tracers of the matter distribution in the large scale structure of the universe . in the standard picture of cosmic structure formation",
    ", clusters are mostly composed of dark matter ( dm ) as indicated by a great deal of observational evidence , with the added assumptions that dm is non relativistic ( cold ) and collisionless , referred to as cdm .",
    "strong evidence for substantial dm in clusters comes from multiwavelength studies of interacting clusters @xcite , in which weak gravitational lensing of background galaxies enables us to directly map the distribution of gravitating matter in merging clusters regardless of the physical / dynamical state of the system .",
    "the bulk of the baryons in clusters , on the other hand , reside in the x - ray emitting intracluster medium ( icm ) , where the x - ray surface brightness traces the gravitational mass dominated by dm .",
    "the remaining baryons are in the form of luminous galaxies and faint intracluster light @xcite .",
    "since rich clusters represent high density peaks in the primordial fluctuation field , their baryonic mass fraction and its redshift dependence can in principle be used to constrain the background cosmology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the gas mass to total mass ratio ( the gas fraction ) in clusters can be used to place a lower limit on the cluster baryon fraction , which is expected to match the cosmic baryon fraction , @xmath10 .",
    "however , non - gravitational processes associated with cluster formation , such as radiative gas cooling and agn feedback , would break the self - similarities in cluster properties , which can cause the gas fraction to acquire some mass dependence @xcite .",
    "the deep gravitational potential wells of massive clusters generate weak shape distortions of the images of background sources due to differential deflection of light rays , resulting in a systematic distortion pattern around the centers of massive clusters , known as weak gravitational lensing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the past decade , weak lensing has become a powerful , reliable measure to map the distribution of matter in clusters , dominated by invisible dm , without requiring any assumption about the physical / dynamical state of the system .",

    "the sze signal is a temperature decrement in the cmb sky , and is a measure of the thermal gas pressure in the icm integrated along the line of sight .",
    "therefore it is rather insensitive to the cluster core as compared with the x - ray data , allowing us to trace the distribution of the icm out to large radii .",
    "this paper presents a multiwavelength analysis of four nearby massive clusters in the amiba sample , a1689 , a2261 , a2142 , and a2390 , for which high - quality deep subaru images are available for accurate weak lensing measurements .",

    "the cluster a2142 shows complex mass substructure , and displays a shallower density profile with @xmath498 , consistent with detailed x - ray observations which imply recent interaction .",
    "due to its low-@xmath306 and low @xmath287 , the curvature in the lensing profiles is highly pronounced , so that a sis profile for a2142 is strongly ruled out by the subaru distortion data alone (  [ subsubsec : gt ] ) . for this cluster ,",
    "our amiba sze map shows an extended structure in the icm distribution , elongated along the northwest - southeast direction .",
    "this direction of elongation in the sze halo is in good agreement with the cometary x - ray appearance seen by chandra .",
    "in addition , an extended structure showing some excess sze can be seen in the northwest region of the cluster . a joint weak - lensing , optical - photometric , and x - ray analysis revealed northwest mass substructure in this sze excess region , located ahead of the northwest edge of the central gas core seen in x - rays .",
    "the northwest mass substructure is also seen in our weak lensing mass map ( figure [ fig : maps ] ) based on the much improved color selection for the background sample .",
    "a slight excess of cluster sequence galaxies associated with the northwest substructure is also found in , while no x - ray counterpart is seen in the chandra and xmm - newton images .",
    "good consistency found between the sze and weak lensing maps is encouraging , and may suggest that the northwest excess sze is a pressure increase in the icm associated with the moving northwest substructure .",
    "clearly further improvements in both sensitivity and resolution are needed if sze data are to attain a significant detection of the excess structure in the northwest region .",
    "nonetheless , this demonstrates the potential of sze observations as a powerful tool for measuring the distribution of icm in cluster outskirts where the x - ray emission measure ( @xmath499 ) is rapidly decreasing .",
    "this also demonstrates the potential of amiba , and the power of multiwavelength cluster analysis for probing the distribution of mass and baryons in clusters .",
    "a further detailed multiwavelength analysis of a2142 will be of great importance for further understanding of the cluster merger dynamics and associated physical processes of the intracluster gas .",

    "recently , good consistency was found between high - quality multiwavelength datasets available for this cluster @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed a joint analysis of chandra x - ray , acs strong lensing , and subaru weak lensing measurements , and derived an improved mass profile in a model - independent way .",
    "their nfw fit to the derived mass profile yields a virial mass of @xmath504 and a high concentration of @xmath505 , both of which are in excellent agreement with our full lensing constraints .",
    "more recently , @xcite further extended their multiwavelength analysis to combine their x - ray / lensing measurements with two dynamical datasets from vlt / virmos spectroscopy and subaru / suprime - cam imaging .",
    "their joint lensing , x - ray , and dynamical analysis provides a tight constraint on the cluster virial mass : @xmath506 .",
    "their purely dynamical analysis constrains the concentration parameter to be @xmath507 for a1689 , in agreement with our independent lensing analysis and the joint x - ray / lensing analysis of @xcite .",
    "we remark that nfw fits to the subaru outer profiles alone give consistent but somewhat higher concentrations , @xmath508 ( table [ tab : model ] ; see also umetsu & broadhurst 2008 and broadhurst et al .",
    "this slight discrepancy can be explained by the mass density slope at large radii ( @xmath509 ) for a1689 being slightly steeper than the nfw profile where the asymptotic decline tends to @xmath510 ( see * ? ? ?",

    ", a wider optical / near - infrared wavelength coverage is required to improve the contamination - free selection of background galaxies , including blue background galaxies , behind this rich cluster .",
    "our subaru observations have established that a2261 is very similar to a1689 in terms of both weak and strong lensing properties : our preliminary strong lens modeling reveals many tangential arcs and multiply - lensed images around a2261 , with an effective einstein radius @xmath324 at @xmath2 ( figure [ fig : a2261 ] ) , which , when combined with our weak lensing measurements , implies a mass profile well fitted by an nfw model with a concentration @xmath3 , similar to a1689 @xcite , and considerably higher than theoretically expected for the standard @xmath12cdm model , where @xmath498 is predicted for the most massive relaxed clusters with @xmath511 @xcite .    such a high concentration is also seen in several other well - studied massive clusters from careful lensing work .",
    "the orientation bias due to halo triaxiality can potentially affect the projected lensing measurements , and hence the lensing - based concentration measurement ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a statistical bias in favor of prolate structure pointed to the observer is unavoidable at some level , as this orientation boosts the projected surface mass density and hence the lensing signal . in the context of the @xmath12cdm model ,",
    "this leads to an increase of @xmath512 in the mean value of the lensing - based concentrations @xcite",
    ". a larger bias of @xmath513 up to 50@xmath56 is expected for cdm halos selected by the presence of large gravitational arcs @xcite .",
    "our cluster sample is identified by their being x - ray / sze strong , with the added requirement of the availability of high - quality multi - band subaru / suprime - cam imaging ( see  [ subsec : targets ] ) .",
    "hence , it is unlikely that the four clusters are all particularly triaxial with long axes pointing to the observer .",
    "indeed , in the context of @xmath12cdm , the highly elliptical mass distribution of a2390 would suggest that its major axis is not far from the sky plane , and that its true concentration is higher than the projected measurement @xmath514 . a chance projection of structure along the line - of - sight may also influence the lensing - based cluster parameter determination .",
    "it can locally boost the surface mass density , and hence can affect in a non - local manner ( see eq . [ [ eq : gt2kappa ] ] ) the tangential distortion measurement that is sensitive to the total interior mass , if this physically unassociated mass structure is contained within the measurement radius .",
    "for the determination of the nfw concentration parameter , it can lead to either an under or over - estimate of the concentration depending on the apparent position of the projected structure with respect to the cluster center . when the projected structure is well isolated from the cluster center , one way to overcome this problem is to utilize the convergence profile to examine the cluster mass profile , by locally masking out the contribution of known foreground / background structure ( see  [ subsubsec : kappa ] for the case of a2261 ) .",
    "the ongoing upgrade of amiba to 13-elements with 1.2 m antennas will improve its spatial resolution and dynamic range , and the 13-element amiba ( amiba13 ) will be sensitive to structures on scales down to @xmath515 , matching the angular scales probed by ground - based weak lensing observations @xcite . for our initial target clusters , joint constraints with amiba7 and amiba13 data will complement the baseline coverage , which will further improve our multiwavelength analysis of the relation between mass and hot baryons in the clusters .",
    "a joint analysis of complementary high - resolution lensing , sze , and x - ray observations will be of great interest to address the issue of halo triaxiality and further improve the constraints on cluster density profiles @xcite .",
    "the amiba upgrade will also make the instrument faster by a factor of @xmath516 in pointed observations .",
    "our constraints can be further improved in the near future by observing a larger sample with amiba13 . a detailed comparison between x - ray based and sze / weak lensing - based gas fraction measurements will enable us to test the degree of clumpiness ( @xmath517 ) and of hydrostatic balance in hot cluster gas . the high angular resolution ( @xmath113 ) of amiba13 combined with dynamically - improved imaging capabilities will allow for direct tests of the gas pressure profile in deep single pointed observations @xcite .",
