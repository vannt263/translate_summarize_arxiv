    "study of heavy baryons widens the way to test the standard model .",
    "the experimental data on the heavy baryons are accumulating and waiting for reliable theoretical calculations .",
    "the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite provides a model - independent method for analyzing hadrons containing one heavy quark .",
    "it simplifies the analysis greatly because of the heavy quark symmetry ( hqs ) and allows us to expand the physical quantity in powers of @xmath3 systematically , where @xmath4 is the heavy quark mass . to obtain detailed predictions",
    ", however , one needs to combine it with some nonperturbative methods .",
    "qcd sum rule is a powerful nonperturbative method based on qcd @xcite .",
    "it takes into account the nontrivial qcd vacuum , parametrized by various vacuum condensates .",
    "qcd sum rule has been used successfully to analyze the properties of light mesons @xcite and light baryons @xcite .",
    "heavy mesons @xcite and the ground state heavy baryons @xcite have been analyzed in the framework of hqet sum rules with @xmath3 corrections and @xmath5 radiative corrections included .    with the discovery of the orbitally excited charmed baryons @xcite , it needs to investigate them theoretically @xcite .",
    "this investigation will extend our ability in the application of qcd .",
    "it can also help us foresee other excited heavy baryons undiscovered yet . within the framework of large @xmath6 hqet , we have studied the excited heavy baryon spectrum @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use qcd sum rule to calculate the mass parameter @xmath7 of the excited heavy baryons in the leading order @xmath5 expansion .",
    "@xmath7 is defined in the heavy baryon mass expansion , @xmath8 it is independent of the heavy quark spin and flavor , and describes mainly the contribution of the light degrees of freedom in the baryon . the quantum numbers that describe the hadrons are angular momentum @xmath9 and isospin @xmath10 .",
    "for the heavy hadrons , because of hqs , the total angular momentum of the light degrees of freedom @xmath11 becomes a good quantum number . in this case",
    ", the excited hadron spectrum shows the degeneracy of pair of states which are related to each other by hqs . for the baryons ,",
    "the light degrees of freedom look like a collection of @xmath12 light quarks .",
    "there are two kinds of excitation @xcite .",
    "one is the symmetric representation of the @xmath12 light quarks in the light quark spin - flavor space .",
    "the other is the mixed representation of the light quarks . in the constituent picture",
    ", the former kind corresponds to that the two light quarks with vanishing relative orbital angular momentum move around the heavy quark with orbital angular momentum @xmath13 . in the latter case ,",
    "one light quark is @xmath13 excited while the other light quark and the heavy quark are in ground state .",
    "quark models @xcite indicate that the former lies about 150 mev below the latter . in each representation , the states are not unique .",
    "the lowest lying pair of states in the symmetric representation are denoted as @xmath14 and @xmath15 with `` @xmath16 '' standing for the parity .",
    "it is these states that we are going to calculate .    in sec .",
    "2 , the interpolating fields of the excited heavy baryons are constructed . and the two - point correlation function is calculated .",
    "3 presents the numerical results .",
    "a brief summary and discussion are made in sec .",
    "the heavy baryon current is generally expressed as @xmath17\\gamma^\\prime h^k_v(x)~,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 are the color indices , @xmath19 is charge conjugation , and @xmath20 is the isospin matrix .",
    "@xmath21 is a light quark field , while @xmath22 is the heavy quark field with velocity @xmath23 . @xmath24 and @xmath25 are some gamma matrices which describe the structure of the baryons .",
    "we adopt two kinds of simple forms for @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "usually @xmath24 and @xmath25 with least number of derivatives are used in the qcd sum rule method .",
    "the sum rules then have better convergence in the high energy region and often have better stability . for the ground state",
    "heavy baryons , the way to write down the @xmath24 and @xmath25 was discussed in refs . @xcite and @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the angular momentum and parity of the light degrees of freedom are @xmath26 .",
    "they are the same as that of @xmath27 and @xmath28 except the parity .",
    "therefore the choice of @xmath24 and @xmath25 without derivatives for @xmath29 and @xmath30 is @xmath31 where a transverse vector @xmath32 is defined to be @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 , @xmath36 are arbitrary numbers between 0 and 1 .    on the other hand , the above discussed constituent picture as well as the experience from the excited heavy mesons @xcite , helps us to choose the following form of @xmath24 and @xmath37 with one derivative for @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath38 where @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ deriv ] ) is some hadronic mass scale to make @xmath25 dimensionless .",
    "furthermore it should be noted that the two possible choices for @xmath24 are accounted through introducing parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the baryonic decay constants in the hqet are defined as follows , @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the spinor and rarita - schwinger spinor , respectively .",
