    "the discovery of light - sustaining orbital angular momentum ( oam ) @xcite has brought forth a new degree of freedom for the photon , enabling a wave of novel applications of light .",
    "examples of such applications include angular manipulation of objects @xcite , angular velocity measurement @xcite , higher bandwidths communication using novel multiplexing techniques @xcite",
    "( already with on - chip implementations @xcite ) , new quantum information systems @xcite , quantum memory @xcite and sources of entangled light @xcite , which are beneficial to quantum cryptography implementations @xcite . the same concept of granting light oam by shaping its phase profile has even been extended to the schrdinger wave function for free electrons with direct application to electron beam physics @xcite .",
    "analogous to electron beam physics , the concept of oam can be applied directly at the single photon level by shaping the phase profile of electromagnetic modes .",
    "this remarkable fact enables a single photon to carry angular momentum beyond its intrinsic spin value of @xmath0 , expanding the realm of possible applications of light . a crucial consequence that immediately follows is the possibility of shaping the landscape of electronic transitions in atom - like systems .",
    "unfortunately , such novel phenomena are not expected to be experimentally accessible because `` the effective cross section of the atom is extremely small ; so the helical phase front is locally indistinguishable from an inclined plane wave '' @xcite .",
    "this is true when the atom is away from the center of the oam carrying vortex and is thus no longer exposed to the rapid phase variation at the origin .",
    "moreover , even when the atom is at the vortex center , due to the mismatch between the spatial scale of the electromagnetic field variations and the size of the electronic orbitals , the forbidden transitions to which this idea applies  @xcite would be still far too slow to be clearly observable .",
    "such a prediction has been corroborated in several theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "that said , there can exist rare cases where quadrupole transitions can be interfaced with oam  @xcite , but it is still quite challenging in these scenarios . because observing the quadrupole transition is already challenging",
    ", efforts to observe the infinitely many other higher - order multipole transitions ( and other classes of forbidden transitions ) would seem hopeless .",
    "therefore , new approaches will be necessary to use oam to control and explore forbidden electronic transitions in a wide variety of atoms , molecules , and other electronic systems . in these approaches",
    "it will be absolutely necessary to bridge the disparate length scales of the electronic system and photon .",
    "recent discoveries in the blossoming field of surface polaritons , ranging from surface plasmon polaritons ( spps ) in graphene @xcite , to surface phonon polaritons ( sphps ) in polar dielectric films @xcite , may help bridge this length scale discrepancy @xcite as a result of their extremely short wavelengths , predicted to potentially be as low as just a few nanometers .",
    "the confinement of the electromagnetic field in both conventional and more recent sp(h)p materials enables these modes to be the framework for applications such as more efficient energy transfer mechanisms @xcite , graphene based protein sensors @xcite , radiation sources @xcite , light - based devices @xcite as well as sub - diffraction limit resolution microscopy @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show that by imbuing sp(h)p modes with oam we raise the possibility of tailoring the selection rules for absorption in a way that highly forbidden transitions can be accessed and controlled .",
    "we find that these vortex modes enable new selection rules based in part on the conservation of angular momentum , providing a new scheme for the control of electronic transitions in a variety of electronic systems .",
    "we can use vortices to allow conventionally forbidden transitions to be fast and dominant and we can also use vortices to prevent conventionally allowed transitions from being dominant .",
    "we also show the robustness of this scheme by studying the effect of off - axis displacements relative to the center of a polaritonic vortex . for large displacements of the electronic system we study how the dominance of different absorption processes depends on its radial displacement .",
    "we find the surprising result that even when the atom is off - center relative to the vortex ( i.e. , when angular momentum conservation does nt hold ) , it is possible to make non - angular - momentum - conserving forbidden transitions dominant .",
    "thus , by controlling the placement of the emitter , different transitions may be studied . with future experimental realizations in mind ,",
    "we show how the increase of the confinement of the mode can lead to an enhancement of the absorption rates of the atom - like system at the expense of lower robustness .",
    "this is of particular interest in 2d conductors like graphene where the confinement factor of these polaritonic excitations can be externally tuned @xcite .",
    "to arrive at these results , we developed a unified quantum mechanical formalism for understanding the interaction between electrons and vortex polaritons , considering absorption and emission processes involving one vortex polariton and even pairs of entangled vortex polaritons .",
    "we consider spontaneous emission in addition to absorption because knowledge of such a process would be instrumental in efforts to study quantum optics with oam - carrying polaritons .",
    "we explicitly develop the consequences of this formalism for the interaction of atoms with oam polaritons such as 2d plasmons and hyperbolic polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride .",
    "oam carrying sp(h)p modes are most naturally understood as a superposition of plane sp(h)p modes .",
    "these plane modes are adequately described in the framework of classical electrodynamics by evanescent waves propagating at the material surface . in a gauge where the scalar potential identically vanishes ,",
    "the fields are fully described by the vector potential , which in the electrostatic limit is given by @xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2 corresponds to the in - plane wave vector of the mode ( whose magnitude matches the out - of - plane inverse decay length in the electrostatic limit ) , @xmath3 corresponds to the in - plane position , @xmath4 is the angular frequency of the mode , @xmath5 direction is the out of plane direction , @xmath6 is the amplitude of the field and hats correspond to unit vectors . to fully describe sp(h)p modes ,",
    "it is necessary to determine the dispersion relation @xmath7 .",
    "often a simple ( local ) drude model suffices to obtain good agreement with the experimental results ; however more involved methods , such as the random phase approximation , may be necessary for a better quantitative understanding of the system @xcite .    in order to compare and quantify the confinement of the electromagnetic radiation we define the confinement factor , @xmath8 , as the ratio between the wavelength of free - space radiation and the wavelength of an sp(h)p mode of equal frequency .",
    "the confinement factor is extracted from the dispersion relation as @xmath9 with @xmath10 and provides a figure of merit for comparing different sp(h)p supporting materials . for light - matter interactions ,",
    "we show that just knowing the confinement factor already gives a good order - of - magnitude estimate of the strengths of various light - matter interactions , in consistency with @xcite .",
    "the range of relevant materials and associated confinement factors is vast and includes sphp modes in sic , where @xmath8 can experimentally reach values of 200 @xcite ; sphp modes in hbn , where @xmath8 has been experimentally observed to be near 100 @xcite and where theoretical upper bounds greater than 1000 are predicted by a spatially local model of the sphp dispersion @xcite ; spp modes in monolayer metal films like silver and beryllium , where @xmath8 can reach values around 300 @xcite and 350 @xcite respectively ( although with very large losses ) ; and spp modes in graphene , where measurements of @xmath8 fall in the range of 150 - 240 @xcite for different regimes and where theoretical upper bounds are around 300 @xcite . using experimentally observed confinement factors ,",
    "recent theoretical studies have predicted a dramatic increase in the decay rate of excited states of nearby sp(h)p supporting materials @xcite .",
    "having reviewed the basic properties of plane - wave polaritons , an oam carrying ( vortex ) mode can then be easily understood as a superposition of plane - wave modes whose phase shift is dependent on the incoming angle @xcite .",
    "the resulting radiation profile in the region above the polaritonic material can be written analytically as : @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are cylindrical coordinates defined around the vortex center , @xmath15 is the bessel function of the first kind ( of order @xmath16 ) and @xmath17 is the angle between @xmath2 and some reference direction , set to be @xmath18 without loss of generality .",
    "the full derivation can be found in the supplementary material ( sm ) , in agreement with the prediction in @xcite for graphene spps .    the resulting phase winding gives rise to an oam of @xmath19 , where @xmath16 is an integer . in the sm , we show a unified approach to compute ( and normalize ) vortex modes in any polaritonic material sustaining highly confined modes .",
    "in addition to deriving results for graphene , we derive explicit results for the case of hbn , whose hyperbolic polaritons have been of much recent interest .",
    "it is worth nothing that these shaped polaritonic fields have been realized in silver and gold through the use of slit based coupling @xcite .",
    "thus the same procedure should be applicable to other classes of plasmonic materials , where the confinement factors can be much larger . as we shall soon show , it is precisely this large confinement that will allow for the possibility of controlling atomic transitions using angular momentum .    having written the vortex modes , we can now quantize them and write down electromagnetic field operators and their hamiltonian in the basis of vortex modes . @xmath20 and @xmath21 corresponds to the hamiltonian of the electron , @xmath22 corresponds to the hamiltonian corresponds to the free sp(h)p modes , and @xmath23 to the interaction between the two .",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 are the mass and charge of the electron , @xmath26 the vacuum permittivity , @xmath27 the average relative electric permittivity of the dielectric above and below the interface and @xmath28 the normalization length of the system .",
    "@xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) are the annihilation ( creation ) operators of the field mode with vector profile @xmath31 , as described in the sm .",
    "the parameter @xmath32 is a dimensionless normalization factor which is required for the energy of the vortex mode to be @xmath33 .",
    "we adopt a convention in the sm such that @xmath34 for graphene plasmons at all values of @xmath35 .",
    "we emphasize here that @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( the group velocity ) are the only factors that differ between different polaritonic materials with the same geometry .",
    "that is because the functional form of the vortex modes in the region above the polaritonic material is always the same for a slab geometry .",
    "the factor @xmath38 in other polaritonic materials with the same value of confinement will generally be similar to that of graphene , meaning that we can understand the strength of light - matter interactions with vortices almost entirely in terms of the confinement factor . in the sm",
    ", we explicitly discuss the role of the @xmath36 and @xmath37 factors for 2d plasmonic materials and for hbn . in figure ( s1 ) of the sm",
    ", we compare the @xmath38 of hbn ( for the fundamental branch in the upper reststrahlen band ) to that of graphene as a function of polaritonic confinement and find that they are consistently of the same order of magnitude .",
    "this automatically means that our claims about the ability to control forbidden transitions using polaritonic vortices hold just as well for hbn as they do for graphene .",
    "this may be of interest given the relatively low losses of phonon polaritons in hbn .",
    "the reason behind the quantum treatment of the problem ( as opposed to a semi - classical treatment ) arises from the extendability of this approach .",
    "this formalism enables us , for example , to consider absorption and spontaneous emission ( at any order in quantum electrodynamics ) in the same framework , which is clearly not possible classically .",
    "moreover it connects absorption at the single - polariton level to the purcell factor , thus allowing one to easily understand absorption through the purcell factor . in the sm",
    ", we derive general expressions for absorption and spontaneous emission of polaritonic vortex modes by electronic systems up to second - order in perturbation theory , providing tools by which to pursue further interesting directions in the quantum optics of shaped polaritons . as an explicit example , in the sm we analyze two - polariton emission processes in the oam basis . in the main text of the paper , we focus purely on the absorption of vortex polaritons at first - order perturbation theory and derive the corresponding transition rates using fermi s golden rule . the higher order term @xmath39 is neglected in this analysis , since , to lowest order , it only provides an overall constant correction to the energy of the system and it is not responsible for the transition between different electronic states . finally , we point out that the choice of a hydrogen atom as the absorber is for theoretical simplicity and to further illustrate our results with a specific example .",
    "our calculations can readily be extended to other atomic , molecular , and solid - state systems . in an experiment",
    ", one may likely opt for an electronic system whose position over the vortex can be controlled very precisely , such as quantum dots or quantum wells . to this end , we start our analysis by ignoring the motion of the electronic system ( as is quite commonly done )",
    ". then we provide a means for analyzing interactions between atoms and vortices when there is considerable uncertainty in the position of the atom .",
    "in this work we consider the absorption transitions of an electron in a hydrogen atom located a height @xmath40 above a surface supporting oam carrying sp(h)p modes , as depicted in figure ( [ fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "computing the absorption rates , we describe new selection rules that arise in this system and their robustness to the displacement of the atom s position relative to the vortex center . throughout this paper",
    "we take as an example the family of transitions from initial principal quantum number 5 to final principal quantum number 6 .",
    "because of the wide range of possible transitions , both dipole allowed and forbidden , we can illustrate both enhancement and control over transitions via a wide variety of examples .",
    "nevertheless , the properties reported in this study are not unique to this family of transitions or to this specific electronic system , and similar qualitative results arise in other transition families and in other atom - like systems .",
    "computing the absorption rate for the case where the atom is aligned with the vortex center , for different electronic transitions and vortex modes , we obtain the results shown in figure ( [ fig2 ] ) throughout this paper , our calculations refer to the absorption rates of a single photon . within the fermi golden rule ,",
    "the transition rate is proportional to the number of photons in the system which enables direct generalization of our results .",
    "these results make evident the selection rules associated with the conservation of angular momentum : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the change in z - projected angular momentum of the electron and @xmath43 is the oam of the vortex mode . by generating a sp(h)p vortex mode ,",
    "we are able to control the electronic transitions of the atom , for arbitrarily large values of @xmath44 .",
    "this selection rule is exact and arises from the requirement that the azimuthal phase term of the mode ( @xmath45 ) and the orbital wavefunction product ( @xmath46 ) must cancel for the interaction matrix element to be non - zero .",
    "this ( mis)match of phase between the vortex mode and atomic degrees of freedom is illustrated in the phase plots on the right side of figure ( [ fig2 ] ) , corresponding to different highlighted transitions on the left plot .",
    "the impact of the confinement factor on the transitions rates is also of importance as it guides the choice of material for possible future experiments .",
    "a greater confinement leads to an increase in the absorption rate by many orders of magnitude in dipole forbidden transitions , as higher multipole terms of the interaction become allowed @xcite .",
    "for example , for the dipole forbidden transition @xmath47 transition , an e4/hexadecapole transition , the increase of the confinement factor from @xmath48 to @xmath49 leads to an increase in the transition rate from an event every many 100 s of years to one every 10 @xmath50 . by coupling to higher multipole modes of radiation the allowed transitions are only constrained by the conservation of angular momentum described in equation ( [ eq : sel ] ) .",
    "all the transitions fulfilling this condition yield non - zero transition rates , albeit with different magnitudes .",
    "however , in real experimental systems we expect the rotational symmetry , responsible for the selection rules of equation ( [ eq : sel ] ) , to be broken by the uncertainty in the placement of the atom .",
    "it is then important to understand the robustness of the new selection rules as the symmetry of the system is broken by the displacement of the atom with respect to the vortex center . when analyzing the absorption rate as a function of the position of the atom we find , as one would expect , that the selection rule no longer applies exactly , but that the corresponding transition is still the dominant process near the center , as shown in figs.([fig3],[fig4 ] ) .",
    "however , surprisingly , this dominance occurs over a displacement of the order of the wavelength of the mode rather than , as one might expect , the size of the electronic system .",
    "this result can be understood by considering the vortex ( displaced relative to the atom ) as a superposition of vortex modes centered at the atom .",
    "the linearity of the interaction matrix element with respect to the field implies that only a single vortex mode ( satisfying equation ( [ eq : sel ] ) ) will contribute to the absorption rate .",
    "since the expansion of the vortex mode is independent of the electronic system in consideration the wavelength of the mode is the only length scale that can determine the dependence of the absorption rate with distance .",
    "in particular the overlap between a vortex mode with oam of @xmath43 displaced by @xmath51 and an atom - centered vortex mode of oam @xmath52 has magnitude @xmath53 , where @xmath35 is the in - plane momentum of the mode .",
    "this arises from the properties of the bessel functions and its full derivation can be found in the sm .",
    "the absorption rates in the displaced case can then be simply calculated as : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the transition rate between levels with @xmath56 change in the z - projected angular momentum of an electronic system at @xmath51 due to a vortex with charge @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath58 corresponds to the angular momentum conserving transition rate in a vortex centered electronic system and is defined as the baseline transition rate .",
    "this analysis yields an even more surprising qualitative result ; for special values of @xmath59 where @xmath60 , a transition characterized by @xmath44 is truly forbidden . in other words for every transition ( even @xmath61 )",
    "there are concentric rings with radii of the order of the wavelength where the transition is truly forbidden .",
    "the transitions from a system initially in the state ( 5,0,0 ) as a function of the displacement d of the atom from the vortex center are studied in the left column of figure ( [ fig3 ] ) , where each row corresponds to a different value of oam @xmath43 carried by the vortex mode .",
    "although for @xmath62 the selection rule equation ( [ eq : sel ] ) is always satisfied and nearby the center of the vortex this transition is always dominant , increasing @xmath59 yields a much richer landscape of transition rates , which is qualitatively different for different @xmath57 .",
    "this fact implies that , given a single vortex mode , it is possible to tune the dominant transition using the radial position of the electronic system , providing an extra degree of freedom to control light - matter interactions . the fact that the absorption rate can be separated into a baseline rate , which specifies the scale of the transition rate , and an oscillatory bessel term , which determines the displacement dependence , enables a simple yet powerful understanding of the relationship between different absorption rates .",
    "in particular , since the coefficients @xmath63 have different zeros for any two different values of @xmath44 , there are always regions where one transition dominates over the other .",
    "the previous discussion provides a framework for understanding a single atom - like system , whose position is known perfectly .",
    "however , in a real experimental setting there is always some inherent uncertainty associated with the position of the atom .",
    "other experimental challenges arise from the manipulation and preparation of the system , as well as the measurement of a meaningful spectroscopic signal from a single atom . to overcome these challenges",
    ", experimental realizations may require introducing more than one atom per vortex mode , or fabricating a sample that supports an array of vortices , as schematically pictured in the inset of figure ( [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "in particular , the recent realization of geometries where the spp energy is fully localized inside the coupling grating @xcite provides the platform to make this technique a viable option for increasing the measured signal without interaction between nearby vortex modes .",
    "the before - mentioned position uncertainty can be modeled through a probability distribution over the position of the atom . in this work",
    "we consider the radially uniform distribution of radius @xmath64 around the vortex center , which , despite its simplicity , provides the same qualitative results as other , more complex , vortex centered distributions . in the right column of figure ( [ fig3 ] ) , the expected absorption rate is computed for such distributions as a function of @xmath64 . the impact of the probability distribution can be understood as smoothing the single atom absorption rates , leading to two major consequences : regions of dominance of transitions where @xmath65 are moved further away from the center , making transitions with @xmath66 more robust ; and as r increases , processes with larger baseline transition rates",
    "become dominant as the oscillatory behavior from the bessel function coefficient is averaged out .    as mentioned before , the results presented here are not unique to the transitions in use , but are general considerations for all sets of transitions . in order to demonstrate the robustness of the selection rules for even larger @xmath44 , which are normally highly suppressed in the dipole regime , we investigate in figure ( [ fig4 ] ) the absorption of a vortex mode with @xmath67 . as in figure ( [ fig3 ] )",
    ", the left column corresponds to the calculation of the absorption rate for single atomic system , while the right column corresponds to the absorption rate over a uniform distribution of radius @xmath64 of the position of the atom .",
    "as expected , the dominance of the @xmath68 transition is present for small radii , despite having a baseline rate many orders of magnitude smaller than the remaining transitions .",
    "as the atom moves away from the center of the vortex , the dominant transition generally has a smaller @xmath44 , because a vortex of smaller angular momentum gives rise to a larger baseline transition .",
    "the same smoothing observed in figure ( [ fig3 ] ) is present in this case , which enables us to predict the measured absorption rate for a given experimental atom placement uncertainty .",
    "these two plots only contain the transitions which are dominant at some radius ; for a complete plot with all the transitions from @xmath69 , refer to figure ( [ fig : fig3full ] ) of the sm .",
    "to fully characterize the transition dynamics it becomes important to also consider the impact of the confinement factor on the absorption rates and their robustness .",
    "as shown in figure ( [ fig2 ] ) the increase in the confinement of the material leads to an increase of the absorption rates of the atom .",
    "however , it is also associated with an exponential decrease of the value of the field at the location of the atom , due to the evanescent nature of the mode .",
    "the competition between these two effects leads to a peak in the absorption rate after which the exponential suppression of the modes counteracts the increase in confinement , as illustrated in figure ( [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "another consequence of the increase in confinement factor is the decrease in the length scale of the sp(h)p modes , which leads to a decrease in the size of the regions where the transitions of interest are meaningfully dominant , requiring a greater experimental precision .",
    "this creates a trade - off between higher absorption rate and lower displacement tolerance . understanding the impact of the confinement factor in the experiment is of special interest in graphene , where the confinement factor of spp can be externally tuned @xcite , providing an extra degree of freedom for optimizing the experimental setup .",
    "although the discussion in this paper covers sp(h)p mode , these results can be straightforwardly extended to plasmons in conventional metals interfaced with larger atoms , or other atom - like systems like quantum dots . in this case",
    ", the length scales between the wavelength of light and the electronic system are matched not only by confining light , but also by considering larger electronic systems ( e.g. quantum dots ) @xcite . within these quantum dots ,",
    "whose size is comparable to that of the spp mode , the discussion and results presented in this paper also apply . by constructing analogous oam carrying sp(h)p modes we obtain the same selection rules and properties described in this paper .",
    "although in this work we only considered electronic systems with spherically symmetry , equation ( [ eq : sel ] ) arises from the continuous rotation symmetry around the sp(h)p evanescent directions ( @xmath5 ) which ensure that the z - projected angular momentum is a good quantum number .",
    "even more generically than that , vortices will lead to non - trivial selection rules even for systems with merely parity or discrete rotational symmetries .",
    "one consideration missing from our discussion is the presence of losses in the materials .",
    "however it was shown @xcite that for a wide range of parameters , including those of interest in this work ( large confinement factors ) , the transition rates are insensitive to losses , even for quality factors as low as 5 .",
    "our formalism can be generalized to include material losses as shown in a previous work @xcite , allowing our results to be extended to an even wider range of materials .",
    "in this paper we have shown how orbital angular momentum carrying polaritonic vortex modes can be used to selectively induce electronic transitions in nearby electronic systems .",
    "we showed how new selection rules , corresponding to angular momentum conservation , arise when the atom - like system is aligned with the center of the vortex mode . in the off - centered case",
    ", we showed how the transition that conserves angular momentum ( @xmath70 ) is always dominant near the center . for larger displacements of the electronic system ,",
    "different transitions become dominant within displacements of the order of the wavelength of the mode as opposed to , as one would expect , the electronic orbital length scale . as a result , by varying the radial position of our electronic system ,",
    "a single sp(h)p vortex mode is able to access a variety of novel transitions .",
    "the results presented in this work have important implications both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "the ability to generate masks in substrates which support an oam carrying vortex spp has already been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "fabricating an array of such masks provides the first step towards an experimental setup capable of observing and further expanding the ideas presented in this paper .",
    "these suggest several exciting directions for future research . of great interest",
    "is the study and engineering of other slit geometries ( beyond vortex producing geometries ) , which may lead to shaped field profiles with more complex and exotic selection rules , providing a general platform for the control and generation of quantum states in atom - like systems .",
    "an interesting direction of research will be finding alternative sources of shaped polaritons ( such as vortex modes ) , that can be applied to cases where creating a mask may prove to challenging .",
    "one interesting possibility is using electronic systems whose bound states have cylindrical ( not spherical ) symmetry , such as an idealized quantum dot . due to the angular momentum quantum number of the initial and final electronic states",
    ", these cylindrical emitters can potentially emit modes of a fixed orbital angular momentum , acting as sources of angular momentum modes on the single - photon scale .",
    "one can use the same cylindrical emitter to generate different oam photons by tailoring the purcell factor to have large peaks associated with different transitions of the same emitter ( which each can be associated with different changes in orbital angular momentum ) .",
    "these single - polariton sources can then be potentially interfaced with absorbers .    in the long term",
    ", the ability to engineer the electronic transitions in a quantum system , enabled by polaritonic modes , opens the doors for many applications which depend on usually inaccessible quantum states .",
    "generating these quantum states in simple table - top settings leads to novel light emitting devices and even lasing technologies , by enabling new decay paths in quantum systems . at the same time , including oam carrying polariton modes in the toolbox of spectroscopists adds a new technique with which to probe and investigate electronic transitions and states , in particular in multi - electron systems , where the large degeneracy of the states is lifted and an even greater control over the electronic transitions is allowed .",
    "in this supplementary material we derive expressions for rates of transitions in which an atom absorbs ( or emits ) a polariton with orbital angular momentum .",
    "we will focus on the particular case of 2d plasmons described by a local drude model and hyperbolic surface phonon polaritons in uniaxial hbn .",
    "however , we present our results in a form that allows for straightforward extension not only to other conductivity models for 2d plasmonic materials but also to other surface polaritons such as surface exciton polaritons .",
    "we begin by constructing the classical vortex modes for polaritons that are highly confined",
    ". then we develop quantized field operators in this basis of modes with definite orbital angular momentum and we use these operators to compute transition rates at first and second order in perturbation theory .",
    "in this section we describe classical surface polariton plane - wave modes for the case of a thin metallic film surrounded by dielectric . through superposition of these planar modes we build vortex modes labeled by the winding number of the phase .",
    "having described the vortex modes , we prove their orthogonality and show how translated vortex modes can be resolved in a superposition of non - translated ( centered ) vortex modes .",
    "we then develop a simpler formalism for constructing vortex modes , one that works when the vortex modes are highly sub - wavelength ( i.e. , when the modes are nearly longitudinal ( curl - free ) and thus well - described by a scalar electric potential ) .",
    "surface polariton modes generically correspond to excitations in solids which are coupled to electromagnetic modes highly confined to the interface of the material .",
    "of particular interest are surface plasmon polaritons ( spp ) and surface phonon polaritons ( sphp ) , where the solid excitation corresponds to a plasmon or phonon respectively .",
    "but other surface polaritons exist in nature , such as surface exciton polaritons in semiconductors like zno , and cucl .",
    "the electromagnetic modes associated with these surface polaritons can be obtained by solving maxwell s equations with the particular dielectric function ( which may be spatially non - local ) of the polaritonic material . for a thin film ( quasi-2d )",
    "geometry with surrounding dielectrics ( as in figure ( [ fig : s1 ] ) of the main text ) , the planar sp(h)p mode is given by @xcite : @xmath71    where @xmath2 is the in - plane momentum , @xmath72 is the out of plane decay length , @xmath14 is the out of plane coordinate , @xmath3 is the in - plane position , @xmath4 is the frequency of the mode , @xmath6 is the amplitude of the mode and hats represent unit vectors . within the electrostatic limit",
    ", @xmath73 , the inverse decay length of the mode equals the in - plane momentum , @xmath74 , enabling the approximation in eq .",
    "having described the plane - wave surface polariton mode , we now build the vortex polariton modes as a superposition of surface plane - wave modes whose superposition coefficients are phases ( @xmath75 ) proportional to the angle ( @xmath17 ) of the plane - wave mode . in order for the mode to be well defined , as one goes around the vortex center , the phase of the mode must change by @xmath76 for @xmath77 .",
