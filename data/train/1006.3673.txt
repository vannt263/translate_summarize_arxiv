    "the advantage of recently realized superfluid @xmath6k and @xmath7li fermi gases@xcite is that one can experimentally tune various physical parameters .",
    "this unique property enables us to study various physical properties of fermi superfluids in a wide parameter region@xcite .",
    "since the background physics of superfluid fermi gas is essentially the same as superconductivity , the study of former atomic system is also useful for understanding the latter electron system . indeed , using a tunable interaction associated with a feshbach resonance@xcite , one can study superfluid properties from the weak - coupling regime to the strong - coupling limit in a unified manner@xcite . in the intermediate coupling regime ( crossover region ) , strong pairing fluctuations lead to the pseudogap phenomenon@xcite , which is related to the under - doped regime of high-@xmath8 cuprates@xcite .",
    "in addition , a cold fermi gas loaded onto an optical lattice is well described by the hubbard model@xcite , which is one of the most fundamental models in strongly - correlated electron system .",
    "thus , using this lattice fermi gas , we may study various phenomena originating from strong correlation , such as mott insulator@xcite , and unconventional pairing state@xcite .",
    "we also point out that a superfluid fermi gas with population imbalance is similar to superconductivity under an external magnetic field , so that the possibility of fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov(fflo ) state@xcite has been recently discussed in polarized fermi gases@xcite .",
    "the above examples clearly show the importance of cold fermi gas as a _ quantum simulator _ for metallic superconductivity .",
    "however , at the same time , we also know that the current stage of superfluid fermi gas can not cover all the important topics discussed in superconductivity . in metallic superconductivity , magnetism is known to strongly affect superconducting properties@xcite . in particular ,",
    "the conventional @xmath9-wave pairing is easily destroyed by ferromagnetism , because the latter tends to align spins in the same direction , which is unfavourable for the singlet cooper pairing@xcite . on the other hand , in superfluid fermi gases , ` spins ' in cooper pairs",
    "are actually _ pseudospins _ describing two atomic hyperfine states .",
    "thus , at present , there is no object corresponding to the magnetic impurity in superconductivity .",
    "thus , if we can introduce a _ magnetic object _ to a cold fermi gas , together with the tunable interaction and optical lattice , this system would become a more useful quantum simulator to study metallic superconductivity .    in this paper",
    ", we theoretically discuss an idea which enables us to study magnetic effects on superfluid fermi gases . among various magnetic effects discussed in metallic superconductivity , in this paper ,",
    "we focus on a superfluid / ferromagnet / superfluid ( sfs)-junction . in superconductivity , the sfs - junction in fig.[fig.1](a ) is well known to modulate the phase of superconducting order parameter .",
    "namely , it induces the @xmath5-phase@xcite shown in fig.[fig.1](b ) , where the order parameter changes its sign across the sfs - junction .",
    "such a phase modulation does not occur in the superconductor / insulator / superconductor ( sis)-junction in fig.[fig.1](c ) , where what we call the 0-phase shown in fig.[fig.1](d ) is realized .",
    "the origin of @xmath5-phase in the superconducting sfs - junction is deeply related to the fflo state .",
    "when the order parameter @xmath10 penetrates into the ferromagnetic junction , a molecular field in the ferromagnet induces an fflo - like spatial oscillation of @xmath10 . inside the junction , when the sign of oscillating order parameter at the right edge of the junction is opposite to the sign of the order parameter at the left edge , the @xmath5-phase is realized . on the other hand ,",
    "when the order parameter has the same sign at both the edges , the @xmath11-phase is obtained .",
    "indeed , a transition between @xmath11-phase and @xmath5-phase ( 0-@xmath5 transition ) has been observed in nb / cu@xmath12ni@xmath13/nb - junction , when one varies the thickness of ferromagnetic cu@xmath12ni@xmath13-layer@xcite .     in the @xmath5-phase .",

    "we explain the outline of our idea . in a superfluid fermi gas with population imbalance ,",
    "the phase separation has been observed@xcite , as schematically shown in fig.[fig.2](a ) .",
    "then , noting that excess atoms tend to occupy the spatial region where potential energy is large@xcite , we expect that , in a double well potential , excess atoms are also localized around the central potential barrier , as shown in fig.[fig.2](b ) .",
    "regarding this central region as a _ ferromagnet of pseudospin-@xmath4 _ , fig.[fig.2](b ) looks like an sfs - junction . although this ferromagnet is actually a gas of atoms in the hyperfine state described by pseudospin-@xmath4 , we will find that it indeed induces the @xmath5-phase as in the case of real ferromagnet .",

    "the inset shows the magnified spatial variation of @xmath45 in the ferromagnetic junction ( @xmath98 ) . ]",
    "as explained in the introduction , the @xmath5-phase originates from the fflo - type spatial oscillation of order parameter in the ferromagnetic junction .",
    "because of this mechanism , the 0-@xmath5 transition has been observed in superconducting nb / cu@xmath12ni@xmath13/nb - junction@xcite , as one varies the thickness of ferromagnetic cu@xmath12ni@xmath13-layer . in the present superfluid fermi gas , since the thickness of ferromagnetic junction depends on @xmath79 ( see fig.[fig.5](a ) . ) , we can also expect the same phenomenon .",
    "indeed , fig.[fig.6 ] shows that the 0-phase becomes more stable than the @xmath5-phase when two excess @xmath4-spin atoms are localized around the potential barrier ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "we show the self - consistent solutions in this case in fig.[fig.7 ] . in this case , since the 0-phase is the most stable state , to make the @xmath5-phase solution , one needs to forcibly _ bend _ the order parameter in the ferromagnetic junction , which leads to the fine structure around the barrier seen in fig.[fig.7](a2 ) .",
    "figure [ fig.6 ] shows that the @xmath5-phase again becomes more stable than the 0-phase when @xmath95 . in this case",
    ", we see in fig.[fig.8](b ) an fflo - like oscillation with the wavelength @xmath100 in the ferromagnetic junction ( @xmath101 ) . in the ordinary fflo state , the wavelength of the order parameter oscillation is given by@xcite , @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the fermi velocity and an external magnetic field , respectively ( where @xmath104 involves the bohr magneton ) . in the present model hamiltonian in eq.([mfh ] ) , @xmath104 in the ferromagnetic junction is evaluated as , @xmath105 , \\label{eq.fflo2}\\ ] ] where @xmath106 is the polarization averaged over the junction .",

    "when the ferromagnetic junction becomes very thick , the josephson coupling between the two superfluid regions becomes very weak . since the energy difference @xmath108 between the @xmath5-phase and @xmath11-phase purely comes from the josephson coupling , @xmath109 in fig.[fig.6 ] becomes small with increasing @xmath79 .     between @xmath5-phase and 0-phase as a function of @xmath80 .",
    "we take @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the inset shows @xmath108 magnified around the 0-@xmath5 transition . ]    while the thickness of the ferromagnetic junction depends on @xmath79 , fig.[fig.5](b ) shows that it is not so sensitive to the pairing interaction @xmath80 .",
    "however , even in this case , fig.[fig.9 ] shows that the 0-@xmath5 transition occurs when @xmath80 becomes large .",
    "this is because , when the bcs excitation gap becomes large due to strong pairing interaction , the _ effective magnetic field _ given by eq.([eq.fflo2 ] ) also becomes large to realize a finite population imbalance@xcite .",
    "thus , the fflo wavelength @xmath112 in eq.([eq.fflo ] ) becomes short , leading to the transition from the @xmath5-phase to the 0-phase .",
    "we briefly note that , while the 0-@xmath5 transition occurs by tuning @xmath79 and @xmath80 , it does not occur when the potential shape is varied by tuning @xmath62 and @xmath63 , at least within our numerical calculations ( although we do not show the results here ) .",
    "this means that the dominant role of potential barrier is a pinning center .",
    "once excess atoms are pinned at the potential barrier , the magnetic effect is dominated by the number of localized atoms @xmath79 , as well as the pairing interaction @xmath80 .     as a function of @xmath113 , in the two - dimensional model .",
