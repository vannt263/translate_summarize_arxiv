    "the _ fractional calculus _ ( calculus with derivatives of arbitrary order ) is an important research field in several different areas such as physics ( including classical and quantum mechanics as well as thermodynamics ) , chemistry , biology , economics , and control theory @xcite .",
    "it has its origin more than 300 years ago when lhopital asked leibniz what should be the meaning of a derivative of non - integer order .",
    "after that episode several more famous mathematicians contributed to the development of fractional calculus : abel , fourier , liouville , riemann , riesz , just to mention a few names @xcite . in the last decades",
    ", considerable research has been done in fractional calculus .",
    "this is particularly true in the area of the calculus of variations , which is being subject to intense investigations during the last few years @xcite .",
    "applications include fractional variational principles in mechanics and physics , quantization , control theory , and description of conservative , nonconservative , and constrained systems @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , the classical calculus of variations and optimal control is extended by substituting the usual derivatives of integer order by different kinds of fractional ( non - integer ) derivatives .",
    "it is important to note that the passage from the integer / classical differential calculus to the fractional one is not unique because we have at our disposal different notions of fractional derivatives .",
    "this is , as argued in @xcite , an interesting and advantage feature of the area .",
    "most part of investigations in the fractional variational calculus are based on the replacement of the classical derivatives by fractional derivatives in the sense of riemann  liouville , caputo , riesz , and jumarie @xcite . independently of the chosen fractional derivatives , one obtains , when the fractional order of differentiation tends to an integer order , the usual problems and results of the calculus of variations .",
    "although the fractional euler  lagrange equations are obtained in a similar manner as in the standard variational calculus @xcite , some classical results are extremely difficult to be proved in a fractional context . this explains , for example , why a fractional legendre type condition is absent from the literature of fractional variational calculus . in this work",
    "we give a first result in this direction ( theorem  [ thm1 ] ) .    despite its importance in applications ,",
    "less is known for discrete - time fractional systems @xcite . in @xcite miller and ross",
    "define a fractional sum of order @xmath3 _ via _ the solution of a linear difference equation .",
    "they introduce it as ( see  [ sec0 ] for the notations used here ) @xmath4 definition is analogous to the riemann - liouville fractional integral @xmath5 of order @xmath3 , which can be obtained _ via _ the solution of a linear differential equation @xcite .",
    "basic properties of the operator @xmath6 in ( [ naosei8 ] ) were obtained in @xcite .",
    "more recently , atici and eloe introduced the fractional difference of order @xmath7 by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the integer part of @xmath10 , and developed some of its properties that allow to obtain solutions of certain fractional difference equations @xcite .",
    "the fractional differential calculus has been widely developed in the past few decades due mainly to its demonstrated applications in various fields of science and engineering @xcite .",
    "the study of necessary optimality conditions for fractional problems of the calculus of variations and optimal control is a fairly recent issue attracting an increasing attention  see @xcite and references therein  but available results address only the continuous - time case .",
    "it is well known that discrete analogues of differential equations can be very useful in applications @xcite and that fractional euler - lagrange differential equations are extremely difficult to solve , being necessary to discretize them @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is pertinent to develop a fractional discrete - time theory of the calculus of variations for the time scale @xmath11 , @xmath1 ( definitions in section  [ sec0 ] ) .",
    "computer simulations show that this time scale is particularly interesting because when @xmath2 tends to zero one recovers previous fractional continuous - time results .",
    "our objective is two - fold . on one hand",
    "we proceed to develop the theory of _ fractional difference calculus _ , namely , we introduce the concept of left and right fractional sum / difference ( definition  [ def0 ] ) . on the other hand , we believe that the present work will potentiate research not only in the fractional calculus of variations but also in solving fractional difference equations , specifically , fractional equations in which left and right fractional differences appear . because the theory of fractional difference calculus is still in its infancy @xcite , the paper is self contained . in  [ sec0 ] we introduce notations , we give necessary definitions , and prove some preliminary results needed in the sequel",
    ". main results of the paper appear in  [ sec1 ] : we prove a fractional formula of @xmath2-summation by parts ( theorem  [ teor1 ] ) , and necessary optimality conditions of first and second order ( theorems  [ thm0 ] and [ thm1 ] , respectively ) for the proposed @xmath2-fractional problem of the calculus of variations .",
    "section  [ sec2 ] gives some illustrative examples , and we end the paper with  [ sec : conc ] of conclusions and future perspectives .",
    "the results of the paper are formulated using standard notations of the theory of time scales @xcite .",
    "it remains an interesting open question how to generalize the present results to an arbitrary time scale @xmath12 .",
    "this is a difficult and challenging problem since our proofs deeply rely on the fact that in @xmath13 the graininess function is a constant .",

    "an euler  lagrange type equation , fractional natural boundary conditions and , and a second order legendre type necessary optimality condition , were obtained .",
    "the results are based on a new discrete fractional summation by parts formula for @xmath11 .",
    "obtained first and second order necessary optimality conditions were implemented computationally in the computer algebra systems and .",
    "our numerical results show that :    1 .",
    "the solutions of our fractional problems converge to the classical discrete - time solutions in @xmath11 when the fractional order of the discrete - derivatives tend to integer values ; 2 .",
    "the solutions of the considered fractional problems converge to the fractional riemann  liouville continuous solutions when @xmath302 ; 3 .",
    "there are cases for which the fractional euler ",
    "lagrange equation give only one candidate that does not verify the obtained legendre condition ( so the problem at hands does not have a minimum ) ; 4 .",
    "there are cases for which the euler  lagrange equation give only one candidate that verify the legendre condition ( so the extremal is a candidate for minimizer , not for maximizer ) ; 5 .",
    "there are cases for which the euler  lagrange equation give us several candidates and just a few of them verify the legendre condition .",
    "we can say that the obtained legendre condition can be a very practical tool to conclude when a candidate identified via the euler  lagrange equation is really a solution of the fractional variational problem .",
    "it is worth to mention that a fractional legendre condition for the continuous fractional variational calculus is still an open question .",
    "undoubtedly , much remains to be done in the development of the theory of discrete fractional calculus of variations in @xmath11 here initiated .",
    "moreover , we trust that the present work will initiate research not only in the area of the discrete - time fractional calculus of variations but also in solving fractional difference equations containing left and right fractional differences .",
    "one of the subjects that deserves special attention is the question of existence of solutions to the discrete fractional euler  lagrange equations .",
    "note that the obtained fractional equation involves both the left and the right discrete fractional derivatives .",
    "other interesting directions of research consist to study optimality conditions for more general variable endpoint variational problems @xcite ; isoperimetric problems @xcite ; higher - order problems of the calculus of variations @xcite ; to obtain fractional sufficient optimality conditions of jacobi type and a version of noether s theorem @xcite for discrete - time fractional variational problems ; direct methods of optimization for absolute extrema @xcite ; to generalize our fractional first and second order optimality conditions for a fractional lagrangian possessing delay terms @xcite ; and to generalize the results from @xmath11 to an arbitrary time scale @xmath12 .",
