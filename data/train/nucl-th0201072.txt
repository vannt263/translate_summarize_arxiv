    "cb provides a convenient way to put constraints on the structure of these nuclei @xcite .",
    "this is of interest also for nuclear astrophysics , since the breakup cross section can be related to the photo - dissociation cross section and to radiative capture reactions relevant for nuclear astrophysics @xcite .",
    "the breakup reactions of the halo nuclei have been investigated theoretically by several authors , using a number of different approaches ( see , e.g. , @xcite , for an extensive list of references ) .",
    "one often used method has been to treat the breakup reaction as the inelastic excitation of the projectile from its ground state to the continuum @xcite .",

    "they were found to be small , for both zero range as well as finite range wave functions of the relative motion of the fragments within the projectile . also , in a dynamical description of the breakup of these nuclei where the time evolution of the projectile in coordinate space is described by solving the three - dimensional time dependent schrdinger equation treating the projectile - target interaction as a time dependent external perturbation , the higher order effects turned out @xcite to be only of the order of 10@xmath3 for beam energies in the range of 60 - 80 mev / nucleon .",
    "a direct breakup model ( dbm ) ( which reduces to the serber model in a particular limit @xcite ) has been formulated within the framework of the post form dwba @xcite .",

    "we consider the reaction @xmath5 , where the projectile @xmath6 breaks up into the charged fragment @xmath7 and the neutron @xmath8 in the coulomb field of a target @xmath9 .",
    "the starting point of the coulomb wave born approximation ( cwba ) is the post form @xmath0 matrix of the breakup reaction which is given by @xmath10 the functions @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are the distorted waves for the relative motions of @xmath7 and @xmath8 with respect to @xmath9 and the center of mass ( c.m . )  of the @xmath13 system , respectively . the arguments of these functions contain the corresponding jacobi momenta and coordinates .",
    "@xmath14 s are the internal state wave functions of the concerned particles which depend on the internal coordinates @xmath15 . the function @xmath16 is the exact three - body scattering wave function of the projectile with a wave vector @xmath17 , which satisfies outgoing wave boundary conditions .",
    "the vectors @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the jacobi wave vectors of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , in the final channel of the reaction .",
    "the function @xmath20 represents the interaction between @xmath7 and @xmath8 . for the pure coulomb breakup case ,",
    "the function @xmath21 is taken as the coulomb distorted wave ( for a point coulomb interaction between the charged core c and the target ) satisfying incoming wave boundary conditions , and the function @xmath22 is just a plane wave as there is no coulomb interaction between the target and the neutron .",
    "the position vectors satisfy the following relations @xmath23 in the distorted wave born approximation , we write @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( 4 ) , the dependence of @xmath25 on @xmath26 describes the relative motion of the fragments @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the ground state of the projectile .",
    "the function @xmath27 is the coulomb distorted scattering wave describing the relative motion of the c.m .  of the projectile with respect to the target , satisfying outgoing wave boundary conditions .    the integration over the internal coordinates @xmath15 , in eq .",

    "( 6 ) , @xmath30 ( the orbital angular momentum for the relative motion between fragments @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) is coupled to the spin of @xmath8 and the resultant channel spin @xmath31 is coupled to spin @xmath32 of the core @xmath7 to yield the spin of @xmath6 ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the @xmath0-matrix can now be written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "( 8) involves a six dimensional integral which makes its computation quite complicated .",
    "the problem gets further acute because the integrand has a product of three scattering waves that exhibit an oscillatory behavior asymptotically .",
    "therefore , approximate methods have been used , such as the zero range approximation ( zra ) in which we write , @xmath37 with @xmath38 being the zero range normalization constant , ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , or the approximation used in @xcite , where the projectile c.m .",
    "coordinate is replaced by that of the core - target system ( i.e. @xmath39 ) .",
    "both these methods lead to a factorization of the amplitude [ eq .",
    "( 8) ] into two independent parts , which reduces the computational complexity to a great extent",
    ". however , the application of both these methods to the reactions of halo nuclei is questionable ( see , e.g. , @xcite , for a detailed discussion ) .    in the finite range cwba theory @xcite , the coulomb distorted wave of particle @xmath7 , in the final channel ,",
    "is written as @xmath40 eq .",
    "( 9 ) represents an exact taylor series expansion about @xmath41 if @xmath42 is treated exactly .",
    "however , instead of doing this we employ a local momentum approximation @xcite , where the magnitude of momentum @xmath43 is taken to be @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the reduced mass of the @xmath46 system , @xmath47 is the energy of particle @xmath7 relative to the target in the c.m .",
    "system and @xmath48 is the coulomb potential between @xmath7 and the target @xmath9 separated by the distance @xmath49 .",
    "thus , the magnitude of the momentum @xmath50 is evaluated at some separation @xmath49 which is held fixed for all the values of @xmath51 .",
    "for further details and the discussion on the validity of this approximation , we refer to @xcite .    on substituting eq .",

    "( 8) , we obtain the following factorized form of the amplitude @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "this amplitude differs from that of the zra studied earlier @xcite as it allows the use of the full wave function for the relative motion of the fragments ( corresponding to any value of @xmath30 ) in the ground state of the projectile .",
    "however , it should be stressed that as for as the postaccetelation effects are concerned , both the amplitudes would lead to identical results .",

    "( 14 ) , @xmath71 corresponds to the coordinates of the relative motion of the c.m .",
    "of the fragments @xmath7 and @xmath8 with respect to the target , while @xmath72 corresponds to that of the relative motion between them .",
    "the cwba description [ eqs .",
    "( 11 - 12 ) ] includes the effects of postacceleration , which refers to the situation where the core @xmath7 has a larger final state energy than what one gets from sharing the kinetic energy among the fragments according to their mass ratio .",
    "this effect arises in a purely classical picture @xcite of the breakup process .",
    "the nucleus @xmath73 moves up the coulomb potential , loosing the appropriate amount of kinetic energy . at an assumed `` breakup point '' , this kinetic energy ( minus the binding energy ) is supposed to be shared among the fragments according to their mass ratio ( assuming that the velocities of @xmath7 and @xmath8 are equal ) . running down the coulomb barrier , the charged particle @xmath7 alone ( and not the neutron ) gains back the coulomb energy , resulting in its postacceleration .",
    "of course this picture is based on the purely classical interpretation of this process , and will be modified in a quantal treatment , where such a `` breakup point '' does not exist .",
    "postacceleration is clearly observed in the low energy deuteron breakup , both in the theoretical calculations as well as in the corresponding experiments ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , in the description of the coulomb dissociation of halo nuclei at high beam energies within this theory @xcite , the postacceleration effects become negligibly small .",
    "we shall investigate this point further for the @xmath1be and @xmath2c coulomb dissociation experiments @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in the first - order semiclassical coulomb excitation theory which was widely applied in the recent years to the coulomb dissociation of the neutron halo nuclei ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , these effects were found to be small , for both zero range as well as finite range wave functions of the @xmath74 system .",
    "one can establish a relation between the apparently very different cwba and the semiclassical theory .",
    "it was recently noticed @xcite that in the limit of coulomb parameter @xmath75 ( i.e. in the born approximation ) , both theories give the same result .",
    "it was further found that this agreement is also valid for arbitrary values of @xmath76 and @xmath77 , provided the beam energies are high as compared to the relative energy ( @xmath78 ) of fragments @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the ground state of the projectile",

    "this equation can be used to investigate the role of higher order effects .      in many experimental situations , the momentum transfer @xmath85 [ eq .  (",
    "20 ) ] is small .",
    "one can expand eq .",
    "( 23 ) ( with @xmath86 ) for small values of @xmath87 to obtain @xmath88 where the relative momentum between c and n is given by @xmath89 , and @xmath90 is related to the @xmath72 separation energy in the ground state of the projectile @xmath91 , with @xmath92 being the reduced mass of the @xmath7-@xmath8 system ) .",
    "this result is in remarkable agreement with the usual first order treatment of the electromagnetic excitation in the semiclassical approximation .    in the semiclassical approach",
    ", the scattering amplitude is given by the elastic scattering ( rutherford ) amplitude times an excitation amplitude @xmath93 , where the impact parameter @xmath94 is related to the transverse momentum transfer , @xmath95 , and @xmath76 by @xmath96 .",

    ", postacceleration effects , will lead to violations of such scaling .",
    "we now investigate the breakup of the one - neutron halo nuclei @xmath1be and @xmath2c . we take a heavy target of atomic number z=82 . in this paper ,",
    "all the higher order results correspond to calculations performed within the finite range cwba model , while the first order results have been obtained by using eq .",
    "the structure term @xmath105 [ eq .",
    "( 21 ) ] was calculated by adopting a single particle potential model to obtain the ground state wave function of the projectile .",
    "the ground state of @xmath1be was assumed to have a 2@xmath106 valence neutron coupled to the @xmath107be@xmath108 core with a binding energy of 504 kev .",
    "the corresponding single particle wave function was constructed by assuming the neutron - @xmath107be interaction of the woods - saxon type . for a set of values of the radius and diffuseness parameters ( same as those given in @xcite ) , the depth of this potential was searched so as to reproduce the ground state binding energy .",
    "this 2@xmath106 wave function has an additional node as compared to a simpler zero - range wave function . for the @xmath2c ,",
    "the ground state was assumed to have a [ @xmath109c(0@xmath110 ) @xmath111 configuration with a separation energy of 0.530 mev .",
    "the radius and diffuseness parameters , used in the well - depth search , were the same as those given in @xcite .    in fig .  1 , we present calculations for the triple differential cross sections for the breakup reaction @xmath1be + pb @xmath112",
    "n + @xmath107be + pb , as a function of the energy of the @xmath107be core ( e@xmath113 ) , for four beam energies lying in the range of 5 mev / nucleon - 72 mev / nucleon . to see the postacceleration in a clear way ,",
    "it is very useful to study the cross - section as a function of the core energy .",
    "the results obtained within the higher order and the first order theories are shown by solid and dotted lines , respectively .",
    "it can be seen from this figure that while for lower beam energies , the higher order and first - order results differ considerably from each other , they are almost the same for the beam energy of 72 mev / nucleon . in each case , the first order cross sections peak at the energy of the core fragment which corresponds to the beam velocity ( this value of the core fragment energy will be referred to as e@xmath114 in the following ) .",
    "in contrast to this , the peaks of the higher order cross sections are shifted to energies @xmath115 e@xmath114 for the three lower energies . only for the 72 mev / nucleon beam energy ,",
    "does the higher order result peak at e@xmath114 .",
    "this shows very clearly that the finite range cwba model exhibits postacceleration for beam energies @xmath116 30 mev / nucleon , while this effect is not present at 72 mev / nucleon .",
    "therefore , the higher order effects are minimal for the coulomb breakup of @xmath1be at the beam energies @xmath117 70 mev .",
    "this result is in agreement with those obtained in @xcite .    in fig .  2",
    ", we compare the first - order ( dotted lines ) and the higher order ( solid lines ) results for the double differential cross section for the same reaction , and for the same beam energies as in fig .  1 .",
    "these results have been obtained by integrating the triple differential cross sections over the unobserved neutron solid angles .",
    "the cross sections are shown as a function of e@xmath113 .",
    "it is clear that for beam energies @xmath116 30 mev / nucleon , the first order results peak at e@xmath114 , but the higher order cross sections have their maxima at energies larger than e@xmath114 .",
    "in contrast to this , both the higher order and the first order cross sections peak at the same value of e@xmath113 (= e@xmath114 ) , for the 72 mev / nucleon case . therefore , the postacceleration effects are pronounced for the smaller beam energies , whereas they become quite small for the higher energies . the near equality of the first - order and the finite range cwba cross sections , at the beam energy of 72 mev / nucleon , suggest that for this reaction , the higher order effects , in general , are quite irrelevant at beam energies @xmath117 70 mev / nucleon .    in fig .  3",
    ", we compare the results of the first - order and the finite range cwba calculations for the relative energy spectrum of the fragments emitted in the breakup reaction of @xmath1be on a @xmath4pb target for the same four beam energies as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "these cross sections have been obtained by integrating over all the allowed values of the angles @xmath118 . in both the models , the integrations over @xmath119 ,",
    "have been carried out between 1@xmath120 to grazing angle , in the upper two figures , and between 5@xmath120 to grazing angles , in the lower two figures .",
    "the integrations over @xmath121 angles have been done over all of its kinematically allowed values .",
    "the dotted and solid lines represent the results of the first - order and the higher order    calculations , respectively .",
    "we notice that while for the beam energy of 72 mev / nucleon , the higher order effects are minimal , they are quite strong for the lower beam energies , being largest at the beam energy of 5 mev / nucleon .",
    "this reinforces the point , already made in @xcite , that at the beam energy of 72 mev / nucleon , the higher order effects are quite small if both the first order and the higher order terms are calculated within the same theory .    in fig .  4",
    ", we show the same results as in fig . 3 , but for the @xmath2c induced reaction on the @xmath4pb target for the beam energies of 67 mev / nucleon , 30 mev / nucleon and 10 mev / nucleon .",
    "4 , the integrations over the fragments center of mass angles is done in the range of 1@xmath120 to grazing angle , for first two beam energies and between 5@xmath120 to grazing angle , at the lowest beam energy .",
    "we see that in this case too the higher order effects are quite weak for the beam energy 67 mev / nucleon , but appreciable for the lower beam energies .",
    "it may be noted that by comparing the result of a conceptually different model of the coulomb breakup reactions @xcite than ours , with that of the first order semiclassical perturbation theory of the coulomb excitation , it has been concluded in @xcite that the higher order effects are substantial for these reactions even at the beam energies @xmath122 70 mev / nucleon .",
    "however , one should be careful in drawing definite conclusions about the role of the higher order effects from such an approach . for a reliable assessment of the contributions of the higher order effects ,",
    "it is essential that both the first order and the higher order terms should be calculated within the same model , as has been done in this work ( and also in @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper , we investigated the breakup of the one - neutron halo nuclei , @xmath1be and @xmath2c , in the coulomb field of a heavy target nucleus , within a theory which is formulated in the framework of the post form distorted wave born approximation .",
    "this theory contains the electromagnetic interaction between the core and the target nucleus to all orders .",
    "an attractive feature of this formulation is that the corresponding pure coulomb breakup amplitude can be expressed in an analytic form .",
    "we have also extracted the first order approximation of the full pure coulomb breakup @xmath0-matrix .",
    "this enables us to investigate the respective roles of the first order and the higher order effects within the same theoretical model .",
    "we studied the beam energy dependence of the first order and higher order triple and double differential cross sections .",
    "we also investigated the contributions of the higher order effects to the relative energy distribution of the fragments .    in the higher order model , the peaks in the triple and double differential cross sections vs. core energy spectra ,",
    "are shifted to energies larger than those corresponding to the beam velocity , at the incident energies @xmath116 30 mev / nucleon .",
    "therefore , postacceleration effects are important at these beam energies . on the other hand , at the beam energy @xmath122 70 mev / nucleon , the corresponding spectra peak at the beam velocity energies , which is consistent with no postacceleration .",
    "in contrast to this , the first - order cross sections always peak at the beam velocity energy , which is expected as the postacceleration is a higher order effect .",
    "the higher order effects are also found to be quite important in the relative energy spectrum of the fragments at beam energies @xmath116 30 mev / nucleon , while they are insignificant at the beam energies @xmath122 70 mev / nucleon .",
    "this suggests that the conclusions arrived at in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the data on the relative energy spectra of the fragments taken in the breakup of @xmath1be and @xmath2c at beam energies @xmath122 70 mev , have been analyzed within the first order theory of the coulomb excitation , may not be affected by the higher order effects .",
    "the present model can be seen as a `` theoretical laboratory '' , which allows to study numerically the relation between quantal and semiclassical theories , and the importance of postacceleration effects .",
    "it should be noted that from an experimental point of view , the postacceleration effects are not fully clarified ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , let us mention the recent work on the electromagnetic dissociation of unstable neutron - rich oxygen isotopes @xcite .",
    "these authors deduce photoneutron cross - sections from their dissociation measurements . if the neutrons are emitted in a slow evaporation process in a later stage of the reaction , the question of postacceleration is not there . on the other hand , for the light nuclei",
    "there is some direct neutron emission component and the present kind of theoretical analysis further proves the validity of the semiclassical approach used in @xcite .",
    "postacceleration effects are also of importance for the use of coulomb dissociation for the study of radiative capture reactions of astrophysical interest .",
    "we expect that our present investigations will shed light on questions of postacceleration and higher order effects in these cases also .",
