    "the noncommutative geometry is an intrinsic property of spacetime and does not depend on any particular feature such as curvature .    to connect the noncommutative geometry",

    "as in the case of the gaussian model , the mass of the particle is zero at the center and rapidly rises to @xmath5 .",

    "since we are interested in galactic rotation curves at some fixed distance @xmath24 from the center , we will consider instead a thin spherical shell of radius @xmath24 .",
    "so instead of a smeared object , we have a smeared spherical surface .",
    "we consider the smearing in the outward radial direction only , that being the analogue of the smeared particle at the origin .",

    "( [ e : vup ] ) are nonzero : @xmath48 we therefore have a stable orbit at @xmath24 due to the noncommutative geometry .",
    "we saw in the previous section that the smearing effect in noncommutative geometry is responsible for the stable orbit at @xmath24 . in this section",
    "we study the effect of reduced smearing ( due to diminishing @xmath33 ) , thereby approaching einstein gravity .",
    "the idea is to show that in this limit , the stability criterion is no longer met .    to this end",
    ", we return to eq .",
    "( [ e : vup ] ) and observe that the third term , @xmath49 strongly dominates near @xmath24 since the denominator is much smaller than the denominator in all the other terms .",
    "as we saw , at @xmath24 , both @xmath50 and @xmath51 are equal to zero , but @xmath52 is positive for @xmath53 and , as we will see later in fig .",
    "3 , sharply increasing near @xmath24 for any fixed @xmath33 .",
    "so the positive third term easily catches up with the ( negative ) sum of the first two terms .",
    "given that the remaining terms are negligible , we can now say that there exists an @xmath54 ( for every @xmath33 ) such tht @xmath55 hence @xmath56 and ( for every @xmath33 ) , @xmath57 in the interval @xmath58 $ ] and @xmath59 for @xmath60 .",

    "the condition in eq .",
    "( [ e : plane2 ] ) can now be viewed as the plane @xmath67 passing through the surface @xmath68 .",
    "the resulting relationship between @xmath33 and @xmath65 in this plane is not a simple one - to - one correspondence because the intersection is oval - shaped .",
    "however , we know that for physical reasons , @xmath33 is necessarily small and @xmath65 close to @xmath24 .",
    "intersection is at @xmath54 .",
    "as already noted , there are indeed two values of @xmath65 for every fixed @xmath33 , but only the smaller value is physically relevant .",
    "3 shows that if @xmath71 , then the left side of eq .",
    "( [ e : q ] ) can remain fixed only if @xmath70 . by continuity ,",
    "then , @xmath72 for @xmath73 , i.e. , the stability criterion is no longer satisfied .",
    "we conclude that noncommutative geometry is not only sufficient but also necessary for meeting the stability criterion . without the noncommutative - geometry background ,",
    "the stability of the orbit would have to be attributed to another cause , such as dark matter .",
    "recall that @xmath59 for @xmath60 , for any fixed @xmath33 .",
    "so outside the smeared region , the stability criterion is no longer met , even though we have a stable orbit at @xmath24 .",
    "the implication is that from a distance , the smearing is no longer apparent , even though it is still very much present .",
    "so , in a sense , the unseen dark matter is replaced by the unseen noncommutative geometry .",

    "@xcite in a simpler and more intuitive way by using the distribution proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite instead of the gaussian function , and ( 2 ) to show that the smearing effect is both a necessary and sufficient condition for meeting the stability criterion .",
    "that noncommutative geometry , which has all the appearances of a small effect , can account for the galactic rotation curves is consistent with the corresponding situation in @xmath74 gravity : only a small change in the ricci scalar is required to account for dark matter @xcite .",
