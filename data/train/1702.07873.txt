    "<S> these bcc phases are remarkable as they derive their stability , with respect to other lattices , from a large vibrational entropy@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> strongly correlated fluctuations of the lattice are predicted to emerge on approach to the solid - liquid boundary , and , for some bcc crystals , the melting transition becomes only weakly first order@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar fluctuations are also expected for melting in the absence of interfaces or dislocations where liquid nucleation is normally initiated@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is a different form of melting , first described by born@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these correlated fluctuations could change the very nature of the solid itself . </S>",
    "<S> however , these have never been experimentally observed .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we explore bcc crystals formed by charged colloids and experimentally probe the nature of these stabilizing fluctuations , and their behavior upon approach to melting . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the crystals are stabilized at low densities by correlated lattice vibrations in direct analogy to their atomic counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> we identify `` hot '' particles that have the largest fluctuations away from their average lattice positions ; they exhibit strong spatial correlation , forming extended connected clusters . </S>",
    "<S> these clusters exhibit fractal configurations on the lattice , whose size diverges critically as the solid - liquid transition is approached . </S>",
    "<S> this gives the phase transition a pronounced second - order character . </S>",
    "<S> however , the affine shear modulus remains non - zero right up to the transition , and thus the transition is strictly first - order . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these large fluctuations cause the system to respond non - affinely , and the non - affine shear modulus vanishes continuously . </S>",
    "<S> these results demonstrate that thermal excitation of the bcc crystal lead to a new state , where the average structure is crystalline but , surprisingly , long - ranged correlated fluctuations govern the behavior .    </S>",

    "<S> the main control parameter in our experiments is the particle volume fraction @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we image each particle in a 90x90x15 @xmath1 m volume at 1 hz with confocal fluorescence microscopy . to determine the short - time dynamics , we complement these data with horizontal two - dimensional slices at 28 hz .    </S>",

    "<S> at even lower @xmath3 the sample melts into a liquid ( fig.1a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the melting of crystalline solids from a superheated state is accompanied by complex dynamics in the form of migrating topological defects @xcite , particle - exhange loops @xcite or premelting at defects @xcite . in our experiments however , we study the approach to melting of samples at a fixed value of @xmath3 ; to the best of our knowledge , the samples are in equilibrium and thus representative of the thermodynamic phase boundaries of the system . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that the measurement of absolute volume fractions in these systems is challenging and may have some error ; in the analysis below we present our data as a function of relative volume fractions , such that these errors cancel and do not alter the validity of our conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> previous work has shown a quantitative agreement between the experimental phase behavior of this system and that predicted by theory @xcite , further supporting the assumption of equilibrium .     </S>",

    "<S> the long - range order of the crystals is reflected by bragg peaks in the structure factor ( bottom row fig.1c&d ) . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , the liquid sample exhibits only isotropic short - range order ( bottom row fig.1a ) . for the sample in coexistence , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate @xmath5 for each region separately , and find distinct bragg peaks for the crystalline region , and isotropic scattering for the liquid region ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the solid - solid transformation from a fcc to a lower density bcc structure which melts into the liquid is in direct analogy to a wide variety of metals , which exhibit a similar transition upon increasing the temperature up to the melting point . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is also in accord with the theoretical predictions for crystals with a low latent heat of melting@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the system of charged colloids , which can be analyzed at the single - particle scale , is an ideal model to explore the general scenario of entropically - stabilised bcc phases and their weak first - order transition .    </S>",
    "<S> we explore the dynamics of this system by determining the mean - square displacement @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe two distinct behaviors ; a purely diffusive behaviour in the liquid and a time - independent plateau of height @xmath8 in the solid ( inset fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig2]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the time - independent plateau in the solid reflects the amplitude of particle fluctuations around their mean lattice positions . </S>",
    "<S> normalising the amplitude of particle fluctuations with the lattice constant @xmath9 gives the lindemann parameter @xmath10 . </S>",

    "<S> the value of the affine shear elastic constant @xmath17 is determined by the symmetry of the lattice and the strength of interparticle bonds @xcite , assuming that all particles are displaced proportionally to the external deformation . from our confocal microscopy data we can directly measure @xmath17 , as detailed elsewhere@xcite . for volume fractions </S>",
    "<S> right up to @xmath18 , @xmath17 remains non - zero ( squares in fig.[fig4]a ) , decaying as @xmath19 , consistent with the predictions of affine theory . </S>",
    "<S> once the sample becomes liquid and a lattice can no longer be defined , @xmath17 jumps discontinuously to zero . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy in crystal elasticity for these systems also persists up to the melting transition @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> combined with the distinct bragg peaks for a crystal coexisting with the liquid ( fig.[fig1]b ) , these data are in full accord with a transition that is strictly first - order .    </S>",
    "<S> our microscopy data provide a means to investigate the nature of the solid close to this transition , where it exhibits large fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , inspection of the images ( fig.[fig1 ] ) and movies ( _ see si _ ) suggests that large fluctuations create pronounced deformations of the lattice , especially at low @xmath3 . to ascertain the nature of these deformations </S>",
    "<S> , we identify `` hot '' particles as those that display instantaneous displacement amplitudes larger than @xmath12 = 0.25 , the ensemble - averaged value at melting @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of `` hot '' particles in the crystal @xmath14 rises steeply to 0.5 just below the melting transition , whereupon it jumps to a value of 1 in the liquid ( fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig2]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find no detectable differences in the local surroundings of `` hot '' particles and all others ( inset fig.[fig2]b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the `` hot '' particles are not homogeneously distributed , but form connected clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we color - code these for several volume fractions in fig.[fig2]c - e . both the size and spatial extent of the clusters increase as the sample approaches the melting transition , where they percolate the field of view ( fig.[fig2]e ) . </S>",
    "<S> these extended and transient clusters are the first observation of the correlated fluctuations implied by the alexander - mctague theory for any bcc lattice where the difference in free energy between the liquid and solid is small@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we determine their size distribution @xmath20 , with @xmath21 the number of particles within a connected cluster . we find a distinct power - law correlation with an exponential cut - off ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5]a ) , whose power - law exponent of 1.75 is independent of volume fraction . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that the clustering of `` hot '' particles is statistically significant by comparing an experimental @xmath20 with a simulated distribution for samples in which `` hot '' particles have been randomly placed on the lattice ( fig.[fig5]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate the scaling between cluster size @xmath21 and their radius of gyration @xmath22 and find that they are fractal in nature , with a characteristic fractal dimension @xmath231.7 that is universal for all @xmath3 ( fig.[fig5]c ) .     </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) a ) experimental affine elastic constant @xmath17 ( squares ) and nonaffine shear modulus @xmath24 ( circles ) , and prediction from the reformulated born theory ( line ) . </S>",
    "<S> inset shows the amplitude of non - affine displacements @xmath25 , b ) illustration of how a heterogeneous distribution of `` hot '' particles ( red ) in a bcc lattice disrupts the local force balance between `` cold '' particles ( blue ) bonded by green arrows . ]    </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , these data exhibit hallmarks of a second - order transition . to demonstrate this we calculate the average cluster size @xmath26 ; </S>",
    "<S> the mean cluster size diverges upon approaching a critical volume fraction @xmath27 with a characteristic power - law exponent of @xmath28 ( fig.[fig5]d ) . as a confirmation of this critical behavior </S>",
    "<S> we also compute the effective cluster volume fraction that also diverges at @xmath27 ( see si ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , not only do we find heterogeneous dynamics within an on - average perfect crystal , which exhibit fractal correlations in space , but the size and volume fraction of these clusters diverge critically . the critical volume fraction @xmath27 for this divergence appears to coincide with the symmetry change at the melting point , which we have shown to be a strictly first - order transition . </S>",
    "<S> this provide new insight into the nature of the weak first - order transition described by alexander and mctague@xcite , but also raises the intriguing question how hallmarks of a continuous transition can coincide with a phase transition which is clearly first - order in nature .    </S>",
    "<S> the key to understanding the origin of this behavior lies with the elasticity of the solid . </S>",
    "<S> the affine elasticity measured by @xmath17 assumes that every particle is displaced exactly proportionally to an applied strain . </S>",
    "<S> however , the dynamic disorder caused by the large thermal excitations at low @xmath3 breaks the local bcc symmetry and causes the local coordination number to differ substantially from the value prescribed by a perfect lattice . </S>",
    "<S> these transient violations of centre - of - inversion symmetry must result in net non - zero forces on every particle in its affine position ( fig.[fig4]b ) , which can only be relaxed upon allowing non - affine displacements@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such non - affine displacements remove elastic energy from the lattice and thus reduce the overal crystal elasticity . to verify this ansatz , we calculate the amplitude of non - affine displacements@xcite @xmath29 ; we indeed find that @xmath29 grows upon approaching the melting transition , where the deviations of perfect lattice order are largest ( inset [ fig4]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , any consideration of the crystal rigidity under these conditions must take non - affinity into account .    </S>",
    "<S> we measure the non - affine shear modulus @xmath24 from the correlations in motion between pairs of particles , averaged isotropically and over all pairs in the field - of - view@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> strikingly , the non - affine rigidity @xmath24 vanishes at @xmath27 ( circles in fig.[fig4]a ) , where the affine modulus @xmath17 remains non - zero . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms the importance of non - affinity due to thermal fluctuations as the crystal approaches melting . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the non - affine modes and a vanishing non - affine modulus are crucial features of several approaches to describe disordered solids @xcite , yet they have remained largely unexplored for crystals to date .    </S>",
    "<S> a remarkable paradox emerges from these observations ; whereas the phase transition is strictly first - order , we measure a continuous vanishing of the non - affine shear rigidity and divergence of collective length scales , akin to a second - order transition . </S>",
    "<S> the affine elastic constants are based on the symmetry of a perfect lattice ; thus @xmath17 must be discontinous as the symmetry changes discontinuously at @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , the non - affine modulus @xmath24 does not require assumption of a specific symmetry and is thus very sensitive to thermal disorder . in effect </S>",
    "<S> , the non - affine modulus provides a local probe of a more random random environment with a symmetry much closer to the liquid ; this results in a transition which is continuous to within experimental resolution .    </S>",
    "<S> for an ordered network of springs deforming affinely , the affine elastic modulus can be estimated as@xcite @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , our experiments show a non - affine modulus which is order - of - magnitude below this limit . </S>",
    "<S> naively , we can set the typical length scale of the clusters of `` hot '' particles @xmath22 as the relevant scale governing the non - affine mechanics in proximity to @xmath27 as @xmath31 , which can be related to the cluster statistics as @xmath32 . from our experiments </S>",
    "<S> we know that @xmath33 ; thus @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , this simple argument explains two key experimental observations : the vanishing of the non - affine modulus at @xmath27 and the convergence of @xmath24 and the affine @xmath17 at high volume fractions where @xmath35 .     </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) a ) cluster size distributions @xmath20 , for @xmath36 0.066 ( diamonds ) , 0.101 ( triangles ) , 0.129 ( squares ) and 0.190 ( circles ) , drawn lines are fits to a powerlaw distribution with exponential cut - off , b ) comparison of experimental @xmath20 for @xmath37 ( filled circles ) and a distribution for a randomized placements of the same number of hot particles ( open squares ) c ) cluster radius of gyration @xmath22 versus size @xmath21 , for 6 different @xmath3 between 0.17 and 0.066 , drawn line indicates @xmath38 , , d ) characteristic cluster size @xmath39 taken as the time - averaged size of the largest cluster ( squares ) or the time- and ensemble - averaged size of all clusters ( circles ) , lines indicate a power - law divergence : @xmath40 . ]    to quantitatively explain our results , we must explicitly account for the non - affinity by extending the original born - huang theory@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> non - affine displacements lower the free energy of deformation and hence reduce the nonaffine shear modulus @xmath24 with respect to its affine counterpart @xmath17 : @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the nonaffine correction@xcite . to find @xmath42 , we adopt a framework for the rigidity of networks with central force bonds . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanical stability is governed by the distance from isostaticity @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the average number of bonds at each node and its critical value @xmath456 defines the isostatic point@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the coordination number @xmath44 represents the number of stress - bearing , permanent , bonds with neighbors ; in this case these are the bonds not part of the clusters of `` hot '' particles . </S>",
    "<S> the stability parameter @xmath46 can be directly related to experimentally measurable properties of the clusters , such as @xmath47 and their pair correlation function.@xcite within this approach , the full derivation of which is given in the si , we predict the shear modulus to vanish as @xmath48 , in which @xmath9 is the lattice spacing and @xmath49 a proportionality constant , which is the only adjustable parameter in our model . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , this theoretical prediction is in quantitative agreement with the experiments as shown by the solid line in figure [ fig4]a .    </S>",
    "<S> these results give rise to an unexpected picture of the behaviour of entropically - stabilised bcc crystals , which by nature are subject to strong thermal excitations . due to the inherently low coordination number in the bcc phase , softening of the crystal </S>",
    "<S> triggers the emergence of strongly correlated heterogeneous dynamics on the lattice , while the average structure of the crystal lattice remains perfect . </S>",
    "<S> the correlated fluctuations and associated non - affine mechanics exhibit the hallmarks of a continuous , critical , transition , that paradoxically coincides with the strictly first - order melting point of the crystal . </S>",
    "<S> such large collective fluctuations increase the entropy of the solid@xcite , which extend the crystal stability to lower densities and lead to a very small jump in enthalpy at the first - order solid - liquid transition . </S>",
    "<S> they are also observed for various atomic crystals such as those formed by sodium or lithium . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , these correlated fluctuations provide the mechanism for the elastic collapse that causes melting of a superheated crystal that was first anticipated by born .    </S>",
    "<S> our observation of strongly correlated fluctuations are unique to the bcc phase , in contrast to , for example , the more common fcc structure in colloidal crystals . </S>",
    "<S> more than other structures , the bcc structure is stabilized by entropy with respect to the liquid @xcite . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> its first - order melting transition can become sufficiently weak that the effects of non - affinity become significant . </S>",
    "<S> we also find the high density fcc phase in our experiments ( fig.[fig1 ] ) , which is stable down to @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> even at these low densities , and at @xmath51 , where the hard - sphere fcc would melt @xcite , the fcc crystals do not show any non - affinity . </S>",
    "<S> this is corroborated by experiments on fcc crystals formed from colloidal hard spheres , in which no deviations from continuum lattice dynamics were observed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we notice that the affine and non - affine moduli converge upon approaching the fcc phase ( fig.[fig4]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> non - affine displacements are therefor not of significance for the fcc symmetry , but that they are a particular feature of the high - temperature , or low density , bcc phase . </S>",
    "<S> this is in full agreement with the predictions of alexander - mctague@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the collective fluctuations we observe increase the entropy of the solid@xcite and lead to a very small jump in enthalpy at the first - order solid - liquid transition , also observed for various atomic crystals such as those formed by sodium or lithium . </S>",
    "<S> our results for colloidal crystals may thus help in understanding weak bcc phases near melting in a much wider variety of systems . </S>",
    "<S> for example , over 40 elements in the periodic table exhibit a high - temperature bcc phase close to their melting line . moreover , low - density bcc crystals of charged particles are of interest in astrophysics , as they are expected to be an important state of matter in neutron stars and pulsars @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results illustrate a scenario in which large thermal fluctuations may bring perfectly ordered solids to a state where classical theories for lattice mechanics break down , and new , richer physics emerges . </S>"
