    "although the samples used were considerably larger than those of previous studies they did not allow an analysis of the x - ray properties of individual subgroups of quasars with sufficient statistical significance .",
    "this was especially true for quasars at higher redshifts , where the results were ambiguous because of the small number of detections in x - rays .",
    "the rosat observatory ( trmper 1983 ) provides for the first time the opportunity to study a very large number of quasars in the x - ray domain .",
    "more than @xmath14 30000 agn are expected to be detected in the ( rass ) of which the majority are not yet optically identified .",
    "a correlation of source lists from the and from pointed observations with existing catalogues yielded more than 1500 detections of previously known quasars with many of them seen in x - rays for the first time .",
    "for the radio - quiet quasars this fraction amounts to about 70% .    in a previous paper ( brinkmann 1997 , hereafter paper  i ) , we have presented the data for 574 radio - loud quasars as dividing line between radio - loud and radio - quiet objects , where r is the k - corrected ratio of radio to optical flux r = f(5ghz)/f(2500 ) . objects with @xmath15 are called radio - loud ( stocke 1992 , paper  i ) .",
    "we used @xmath16 = 0.5 and @xmath17 = 0.5 for the k - corrections ( @xmath18 ) . ] and 80 quasars detected by rosat which show radio emission but either qualify as `` radio - quiet '' or have no radio - loudness available . here",
    "we present the second part of the rosat quasar database  the radio - quiet objects .",
    "we give the x - ray flux densities and estimates of the soft x - ray spectral indices , if available , for objects from the rass ( voges 1992 ) and pointed observations ( rosat - src , voges 1995 ) .",
    "we present data of detected quasars only , although we will use upper limits for the non - detections in some places in the statistical analyses .    in ",
    "2 we present the data and give details of the derivation of the relevant parameters , and we discuss in ",
    "3 the role of possible x - ray detection biases of the sample . the soft x - ray spectra of the radio - quiet quasars are analyzed in   4 .",
    "we then present the relationship between the x - ray and optical luminosity in ",
    "finally , the conclusions are given in ",
    "we have compiled a database of all radio - quiet quasars from the 6th vron - cetty - vron quasar catalogue ( 1993 , from now on vv93 ) detected in the rass , as targets of pointed observations , or as serendipitous sources in pointed observations available publicly from the rosat - src ( voges 1995 ) .",
    "we regard an x - ray source as a detection if the detection likelihood is equal to or greater than 10 as given by the standard analysis software system ( sass , voges 1992 ) .",
    "this threshold corresponds to an about 4@xmath19 confidence level .",
    "we used an angular distance criterion of @xmath20 for the cross correlation as in paper  i. the total number of rosat detected radio - quiet quasars from the above three sources is 846 , of which 289 were seen in the rass only , 385 were only seen in pointed observations , and 172 were seen in both the rass and in pointed observations . amongst them are the 69 objects with radio detections , but qualifying as `` radio - quiet '' according to the above criterion .",
    "they have already been presented in paper  i.    for all sources from the rass and pointed observations we use the results of the sass employing the most recent processing of the survey data ( rass  ii , voges 1996 ) . for objects which have been seen in both , the and pointed observations , we take the data from the pointed observations for the determination of the spectral parameters and flux densities , as their statistical errors are considerably smaller due to the generally much longer exposure in pointed observations .    to estimate the x - ray spectral properties and flux densities we assume that the soft x - ray spectrum can be represented by a power law modified by neutral absorption ( see paper  i for details ) . for most of the objects the photon indices @xmath21 and the absorbing column densities @xmath22 , as well as the photon indices assuming galactic absorption @xmath23 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) were estimated using the two hardness ratios given by the sass with the method described in schartel ( 1995 ) and schartel ( 1996 ) . for 134 objects",
    "this method did not yield any reliable spectral parameters at all .",
    "for another 154 objects we could not determine the photon indices @xmath21 and the @xmath22 values simultaneously , mostly due to the large statistical fluctuations in the small number of photons accumulated from these sources . fixing the absorption at the galactic values yielded , however , proper estimates of the spectral indices @xmath23 of the objects . on the other hand , for 9 objects with simultaneous estimates of @xmath21 and @xmath22 no photon indices assuming galactic absorption , @xmath23 , could be determined .",
    "the x - ray fluxes in the rosat band ( 0.1 - 2.4  kev ) were calculated from the count rates using the energy - to - counts conversion factor ( ecf ) for a power law spectrum and galactic absorption ( rosat ao-2 technical appendix , 1991 ) .",
    "we used the photon index obtained for an individual source if the estimated @xmath24 error of @xmath23 is smaller than 0.5 , and we took the redshift - dependent average value as derived in  4.1 below for all objects with larger errors .    for objects with",
    "more than one pointed observation , the mean values of @xmath25 , @xmath22 , and flux densities as well as their corresponding errors were calculated , assuming that the source did not vary between the different measurements .    in table  1",
    "we list the relevant information for all 846 quasars . in column 1",
    "we give the iau designation and , in column 2 , a common name .",
    "objects originally detected at other wave bands than in the optical and uv ( x - ray , infrared , etc . ) are marked with stars ; a dagger denotes a quasar found to be radio - loud from recent radio surveys . in a few cases there is more than one quasar apparently associated with an x - ray source within @xmath26 .",
    "we list the most plausible object ( mostly the closest ) and mark it with a question mark .",
    "furthermore , objects for which the x - ray flux is obviously contaminated by a nearby source ( usually extended ) are indicated by exclamation marks . following the optical positions ( j2000 ) , we give the redshifts and optical magnitudes , as found in vv93 . in column 6",
    "we list the unabsorbed x - ray flux densities in the 0.1 - 2.4  kev energy band .",
    "the given errors are the statistical @xmath27 errors from the count rates only .",
    "however , for sources with a small number of counts ( mostly from the survey ) the systematic errors can be of the order of @xmath28 % ( see paper  i ) .",
    "further , for strong sources the spectral fits often show that the assumed simple power law slope is an inappropriate representation of the spectrum . in both cases",
    "the systematic spectral uncertainties can be considerably larger than the purely statistical errors and the errors given in table  1 should , therefore , be taken as lower limits . in columns 7 to 10 we give the x - ray power law photon indices and the corresponding @xmath22 values with their @xmath24 errors , either with free fitted @xmath22 or obtained under the assumption of galactic absorption . if no error is given , its value is unphysically large .",
    "a missing entry means that no reasonable spectral index could be obtained .",
    "we used the galactic @xmath22 values provided by the exsas environment ( zimmermann 1994 ) which are based on an interpolation of data from dickey & lockman ( 1990 ) and stark ( 1992 ) . in column 11",
    "we indicate whether the object was detected in the survey only ( s ) , in a pointed observation ( p ) , or in both ( sp ) . if published data are available for an object we use these results ( mostly spectral indices ) if they are of superior quality and we indicate the references in the last entry ( column 12 ) .",
    "in the following we study the broad band energy distribution of radio - quiet quasars using a large optically selected sample only .",
    "we compiled this sample from the above database by excluding those quasars which were originally found at other wave bands than the optical ( x - ray , infrared , etc . ) .",
    "we also excluded objects without available redshifts , magnitudes , or galactic column densities , and those with uncertain identifications or with contaminated fluxes .",
    "the optically selected radio - quiet sample thus comprises 644 objects , of which 202 were seen in the rass only , 320 were only seen in pointed observations , and 122 were seen in both the rass and pointed observations .",
    "it should be noted that the sources detected in the survey form a well defined sample as the survey s limiting sensitivity is rather uniform ( a few times @xmath29 ) , while the objects we draw from pointed observations clearly form an inhomogeneous , incomplete sample because of the vastly different exposures and thus different observational sensitivities .",
    "there are nearly 5000 optically selected , radio - quiet quasars in the vv93 catalogue not detected either in the rass or in pointed observations .",
    "as shown in paper  i , the non - detections in the rass are mostly due to the x - ray weakness of the sources , with fluxes below the survey s limiting sensitivity , and only less than 10% of the non - detections can be attributed to source intrinsic variability .",
    "further , some of the non - detections are actually within a small region of the sky where the rass has a relatively short exposure ; for example , about @xmath30 of the non - detections have an exposure less than 100 seconds . a few objects which are associated with rosat sources but at larger angular distances ( @xmath31 ) are not regarded as identifications .",
    "we excluded them from the sample of non - detections as well . since none of the broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars has been detected by rosat ( one possible case has been claimed by green 1995 and green & mathur 1996 ) , and because there is evidence that bal quasars have soft x - ray properties distinct from the other quasars ( green 1995 , green & mathur 1996 ) , we excluded them from our analyses .",
    "there are thus about 4000 objects with rass exposures of more than 300 seconds , with available redshifts , magnitudes , and galactic column densities , which form the subsample of non - detections in our study .",
    "our sample is based on the vv93 quasar catalogue , which is a compilation of all currently available quasars , and thus it is heterogeneous and incomplete .",
    "the sample consists of the cataloged optically selected quasars without radio detection . for optically faint objects",
    "this does not necessarily mean that they are radio - quiet as the radio emission of some of them might fall below the sensitivity limits of the currently available radio surveys . using the above dividing line @xmath32 , objects fainter than @xmath33 magnitude ( i.e. , a large fraction of objects in the sample , see fig .",
    "1 ) will be classified as radio - loud if their radio flux is greater than @xmath14 1  mjy  a value below all current radio survey flux limits .",
    "in other words , even objects as bright as @xmath0 15th magnitude might erroneously be classified as radio - quiet , because they remain undetected in the currently most sensitive large scale radio surveys , i.e. the 87 gb survey ( @xmath34 20mjy ; gregory & condon 1991 ) and the parkes  mit  nrao ( pmn ) survey ( @xmath34 25 mjy ; gregory et al .",
    "1994 ) of the southern hemisphere .",
    "for example , the cross correlation of the vv93 radio - quiet sources with the pmn radio survey yielded 55 objects , which are thus radio - loud ; 5 of them were detected by rosat ( marked with daggers in table  1 ) and excluded from the analysis .",
    "similarly treated were 12 objects from a recent quasar correlation with the nvss survey ( bischof & becker 1997 ) .",
    "however , we still expect most of the quasars without radio detection to be radio - quiet because of the generally low fraction of radio - loud objects ( @xmath35 , kellermann 1989 ) among optically selected quasars .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "1 the cumulative number - magnitude diagram for the whole optically selected , radio - quiet quasar sample ( squares ) , for all the objects detected by rosat in the rass or in pointed observations ( triangles ) , and those seen in the rass only(circles ) . for illustrative purpose we show as a dashed line the slope for uniformly populated sources in euclidean space , normalized at magnitude @xmath36 .",
    "the curve for the rass detected sources flattens already at @xmath37 due to the limited sensitivity of the x - ray survey , which results in a lower x - ray detection rate at the faint end of the magnitude distribution compared to the total sample .",
    "the inclusion of objects detected in pointed observations greatly enlarges the size of the sample of x - ray detected quasars , especially at fainter optical magnitudes .",
    "however , it does not improve substantially the completeness of the sample of x - ray detections as the accumulated area of the pointed observations covers only @xmath38 of the sky .    the has a relatively uniform limiting sensitivity of a few @xmath39 with the exact value depending slightly on the amount of intervening galactic absorption , on the exact shape of the x - ray spectrum of the source , and on the local survey exposure . in fig .  2 we plot the detection rate ( in percent ) of the rass for the radio - quiet quasars ( hatched ) as a function of magnitude , i.e. , the number of objects detected in the rass in a magnitude bin divided by the total number of objects at that magnitude in vv93",
    "objects with exposures in the rass of less than 300 seconds are excluded . for comparison",
    "the detection rate for the radio selected radio - loud sample ( see paper  i ) is also presented .",
    "apart from the flux limit of the survey , the detection probability at a given magnitude depends on the ratio of the flux densities in the x - ray and optical wave bands . beyond 16  mag ,",
    "the continuous decrease of the detection rate with increasing @xmath40 over about 3 magnitudes suggests a substantial dispersion of the optical flux density ( a factor of @xmath41 ) for the rass objects with an x - ray flux at the survey limit , and thus , a large dispersion in the ratio of the x - ray - to - optical flux densities for radio - quiet quasars .",
    "this implies a similar dispersion of the luminosity ratios between the x - ray and optical wave bands , the x - ray loudness , since the effect of different k - corrections in the two wave bands is small ( a factor of @xmath42 for the typical optical and x - ray spectral indices of @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively , @xmath18 ) .",
    "we will study the x - ray - to - optical luminosity ratio quantitatively in detail in ",
    "it is noted that even at very bright optical magnitudes ( @xmath45 ) there exist a number of objects which remain undetected in the rass and which must thus have very low x - ray - to - optical flux ratios .",
    "some of them , detected later in pointed observations , show unusually weak soft x - ray fluxes relative to their optical emission compared to the bulk of the optically selected quasars , and will be discussed in  5 below .",
    "large differences in the detection probabilities can be seen between the radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars .",
    "the radio - loud quasars have x - ray detection rates significantly higher than radio - quiet objects at a given optical brightness , and they are detected at much fainter optical magnitudes ( down to @xmath46  mag ) . given the average x - ray - to - optical luminosity ratio found previously ( wilkes 1994 , green 1995 , paper  i ) radio - loud quasars are x - ray brighter than radio - quiet objects by a factor of @xmath47 .",
    "if we reduce artificially the measured x - ray luminosities of the radio - loud objects by this factor , taking into account the appropriate k - corrections , we find that many of them would not have been detected in the rass and the detection probabilities of the radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars would then roughly match .",
    "this means that the different detection probabilities are mainly caused by the differences in the x - ray - to - optical luminosity ratios between the two classes .    in fig .",
    "3 the detection rate is shown as a function of redshift .",
    "the most distant radio - quiet quasar detected in the rass is 0053 - 2532 at redshift @xmath48 , however , with a relatively large angular distance of @xmath49 between the x - ray and optical position and a high x - ray - to - optical luminosity ratio of @xmath50 ( see  5 for @xmath51 ) .",
    "the x - ray detection rate of radio - quiet quasars drops much faster towards higher @xmath52 than that of radio - loud objects , and no sources are found in the rass at @xmath53 . in contrast , radio - loud quasars were seen in the rass up to very high redshifts ( @xmath54 ) , and the detection rate appears to increase towards higher redshifts .",
    "however , this increase might not be statistically significant as the total number of radio - loud quasars at z @xmath55 is 48 of which 20 were detected ( cf .",
    "paper 1 ) .    in fig .",
    "4 we show the k - corrected broad band soft x - ray luminosities ( 0.12.4  kev ) of the sources in our sample as a function of redshift ( see   5 for details of the calculation of the luminosities ) . we have used a friedman cosmology with @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the computation of the luminosities . for illustrative purposes we plot ( full curve ) the k - corrected luminosity corresponding to the typical survey detection limit of @xmath58 .",
    "it shows that many sources have luminosities definitely below the survey s sensitivity limit and they could thus be detected only in pointed observations .",
    "more than 100 quasars have been observed repeatedly in pointed observations and they thus provide a good sample for an evaluation of the x - ray variability of quasars . in fig .",
    "5 we plot a histogram of the observed maximal variability of the objects , i.e. , the ratio between the highest and the lowest count rates .",
    "the distribution of the count rate ratio follows approximately a gaussian with a @xmath59 , which is indicated by the dashed curve in the figure .",
    "similar to the radio - loud sample , fig .",
    "5 shows that a large fraction of the quasar population is variable , mostly by less than a factor of two in flux . for weak sources",
    "low intrinsic variability can not be distinguished from statistical fluctuations .",
    "no extremely variable quasars ( by a factor of 5 or more ) , as found in the radio - loud sample in paper  i , seem to exist .",
    "however , if we compare the x - ray fluxes of sources observed in pointed observations with the corresponding rass fluxes , for which the uncertainties are larger , we do find one case of extreme flux variation by a factor of six ( pg 0844 + 349 ) with a count rate of @xmath60 ( 413  s exposure ) in the rass and @xmath61 in the pointed observation , respectively .",
    "interestingly , no statistically significant spectral changes were found between the two observations and the x - ray spectrum is not particularly steep ( @xmath622.5 @xmath63 0.1 ) .",
    "unfortunately , as most of the repeated observations of a source have been performed in different pointing periods we can not make any reliable estimates about the variability time scales and the relation between the time scale and variability amplitude of a source .",
    "spectral studies of radio - quiet quasars in the medium energy range yielded power law slopes @xmath64 in the 210  kev band observed by _ exosat _ ( lawson 1992 ) and @xmath65 ( 90% confidence ) in the 220  kev band observed by _ ginga _ ( williams 1992 ) . in the softer energy range quasars",
    "show a wide variety of spectral indices with a mean @xmath66 ( 0.23.5  kev ) from _ einstein _ ipc observations ( wilkes & elvis 1987 , canizares & white 1989 ) . in the even softer rosat pspc energy band ( 0.12.4  kev ) , spectral studies of quasars generally give steeper spectra ( @xmath67 ) and a wider dispersion of the indices than found in the harder energy band ( brinkmann 1992 , brunner 1992 , fiore 1994 , schartel 1996 , laor 1997 ) .",
    "this steepening of the power law slopes is commonly explained by an additional soft component in the rosat pspc bandpass ( see mushotzky 1993 for a review ) , similar to that seen in seyfert  i galaxies ( turner & pounds 1989 , masnou 1992 , walter & fink 1993 ) .",
    "radio - loud quasars are found to have systematically flatter spectral indices than radio - quiet objects over the total x - ray range , by @xmath4 in the 210  kev energy band ( lawson 1992 , williams 1992 ) , @xmath67 in the 0.23.5  kev band ( wilkes & elvis 1987 , canizares & white 1989 ) , and @xmath68 in the 0.12.4 kev band ( brunner 1992 , schartel 1996 , paper  i ) .",
    "an extra hard x - ray component which is linked to the radio emission of radio - loud quasars might be an explanation for this differences in spectral indices .",
    "we used a maximum - likelihood method described in maccacaro ( 1988 ) and worrall & wilkes ( 1990 ) to estimate the intrinsic distribution of the power law photon indices , assuming that both the distribution of the indices and the uncertainties of the measurements are gaussian . to minimize possible redshift effects",
    ", we split up the sample into different redshift ranges , as defined in table  2 .",
    "we considered only objects for which both indices , @xmath21 and @xmath23 , are available .",
    "for a few objects with extremely small errors of the measured spectral indices due to very high photon statistics we use a lower bound for the systematic uncertainties of @xmath69 to avoid the large statistical weight of individual strong sources .",

    "thus , the spectral slopes in the intrinsic energy range up to 10  kev for high and low redshift quasars are comparable , which implies that x - ray spectral evolution is not important in radio - quiet quasars .",

    "previous studies of quasars with the _ einstein _ ipc gave no indications for intrinsic excess absorption ( canizares & white 1989 , wilkes & elvis 1987 ) . for low redshift quasars , rosat observations confirmed these results showing good agreement between the absorbing column densities obtained from spectral fits and those inferred from hi observations ( schartel 1996 , laor 1997 ) .",
    "recent analyses of rosat and asca observations of high-@xmath52 ( @xmath121 ) radio - loud quasars reveal , however , that excess absorption is common in these objects ( elvis 1994 , siebert 1996 , cappi 1997 , and paper  i ) and might even be temporarily variable ( schartel 1997 ) .",
    "radio - quiet quasars probably do not show this effect ( bechtold 1994a ) , which indicates that this excess absorption is intrinsic to the radio - loud quasars , but the statistics on which this argument is based is poor .",
    "the search for absorption in radio - quiet quasars is hampered by the fact that for most of the high-@xmath52 objects observed by not enough photons could be accumulated for a precise determination of the spectral parameters for the individual object .",
    "furthermore , even if there exists excess absorption it will mainly effect the lower part of the spectral energy band which will be redshifted out of the bandpass if the absorber is at high redshifts as well .",
    "this usually results in large uncertainties in the determination of the absorbing column density .",
    "however , the large number of objects at high redshifts available in table  1 allows a statistical analysis of the presence of this excess absorption in our sample .    for a statistical test",
    "the mean value of the differences between the fitted and the galactic column densities , @xmath122 , is difficult to evaluate because the fitted @xmath22 values are asymmetrically distributed with respect to the actual @xmath123 , with a longer tail towards higher @xmath22 values .",
    "for example , the simple method to calculate the mean by assuming a normal distribution usually gives an overestimate for the mean .",
    "this problem is even more severe in the case of data with poor statistical quality , which results in large uncertainties in the deduced @xmath22 values .",
    "we used an indirect , yet simple , non - parametric statistics to test for the presence of excess absorption .",
    "we assume that there is no systematic discrepancy between the x - ray measured column densities and the radio hi results , and that there are no systematic errors in the measurements .",
    "if there were no intrinsic absorption in any quasar the distribution of @xmath124 should have a mean of zero and a median not greater than the mean . for a sample in which the data are obtained with high statistical significance",
    ", the distribution is approximately symmetric and the median would be close to the mean . then , if the hypothesis of `` no excess absorption '' is true , the median of @xmath124 should not be greater than zero , or , equivalently , the number of objects with @xmath125 ( denoted as @xmath126 ) should not be smaller than half of the total sample , with scatter caused by the uncertainties of the x - ray measurements .",
    "we use the quantity @xmath126 as a test statistic ( binomial test , one - tail ) to test the hypothesis .",
    "we ignored objects for which the corresponding @xmath123 values are higher than @xmath127 as at these values the fitted spectral parameters tend to have large uncertainties in the pspc energy band .",

    "the two @xmath123 distributions are consistent with each other ( @xmath140 test , with a reduced @xmath141 for 9 d.o.f ) .",
    "further , no correlation is found between the obtained @xmath124 and @xmath123 in our data",
    ". a plausible explanation might be the low photon statistics in some of the high - redshift quasars for which only relatively few photons could be accumulated .",
    "we thus restrict our analysis to objects with more than 100 source counts and list the result in the lower panel of table  3 . for @xmath138 objects the probability level",
    "is reduced to 0.23 only , and the data are consistent with no excess absorption .",
    "the previously derived @xmath130 including objects with low numbers of source photons is thus , at least partly , an artifact of systematic biases .",
    "unfortunately , the small size of the sample ( with more than 100 source photons ) makes such a test rather insensitive when the fraction of objects with possible `` excess absorption '' is small .",
    "more observational data for high-@xmath52 radio - quiet objects are needed in order to obtain results with higher statistical significance .",
    "we conclude that the current data are , in a statistical sense , consistent with no or only little excess absorption at all redshifts for radio - quiet quasars , in contrast to their radio - loud counterparts , which show a high incidence of excess absorption at higher redshifts . at redshifts beyond @xmath142 more",

    "the knowledge of the exact form of the relation between the x - ray and optical luminosities is required to relate the quasar statistics ( evolution , luminosity function ) in the two wave bands and to understand the quasars broad band emission .",
    "the x - ray - to - optical energy distribution is commonly characterized by @xmath51 , the broad band spectral index from the ultra - violet ( @xmath10 ) to the x - ray ( 2  kev ) which is defined as the luminosity as to the `` optical luminosity '' , @xmath143 . ]",

    "a dependence of the x - ray luminosity of the form @xmath145 is equivalent to the relation @xmath146 with @xmath147 .",
    "previous studies of optically selected quasars gave the following results : @xmath51 is nearly independent of redshift but it increases with @xmath143 , or equivalently , there exists a non - linear relationship @xmath145 with @xmath148 ( kriss & canizares 1985 , avni & tananbaum 1986 , wilkes 1994 , avni 1995 ) . using rosat survey data for the large bright quasar survey sample , green ( 1995 ) found a similar non - linear relationship . for models of a pure luminosity evolution of quasars , this implies a slower luminosity evolution in x - rays than in the optical .",
    "interestingly , there are recent reports suggesting a linear relationship @xmath149 and , consequently , being independent of @xmath150 ( la franca 1995 ) .",
    "the results were achieved by applying a regression analysis to the _ einstein _ data which takes into account the errors in both variables .    using the large sample of rosat detected radio - loud quasars and similar regression methods , brinkmann ( paper  i ) also found a linear relationship @xmath149 for a subsample ( @xmath151 ) of flat - spectrum quasars and a marginally flatter slope , @xmath152 , for the whole sample of both flat- and steep - spectrum quasars . but the existence of an x - ray component related to the radio emission in radio - loud quasars introduces additional complications in the analysis .",
    "radio - quiet quasars , therefore , seem to be better suited to study the relationship between the optical and x - ray emission , which is believed to originate from the active nucleus .    we convert the observed x - ray fluxes into luminosities as in paper  i. for the k - correction and the calculation of the monochromatic x - ray luminosity , the individual spectral index for an object is used if it is obtained with relatively small error ( @xmath153 ) , otherwise the redshift dependent mean spectral index derived in   4 is used . for the subsample of non - detections , we estimated the upper limits for the source count rates using the local rass exposure at the optical positions of the objects and assume less than 12 source photons from the objects .",
    "this assumption is based on the fact that almost all sources which were found with a detection likelihood less than @xmath154 have less than 12 source photons . for a source within a background of strong diffuse x - ray emission or in the vicinity of another strong x - ray source , this estimate for the upper limit might not be correct .",
    "however , we expect that such cases are rather rare and that they do not affect our statistical results .",
    "furthermore , for sources showing abnormally weak x - ray emission compared to their optical brightness , we have visually checked the rass source images to avoid possible inappropriate estimates of upper limits . for more than 100 objects which were found with detection likelihoods @xmath155 ( @xmath156 ) in the rass but lower than our threshold of 10 and",
    "which were thus not regarded as detections , we used the measured count rates as upper limits . in the optical band ,",
    "the @xmath40 magnitudes are taken from the vv93 catalogue .",
    "we apply an extinction correction using the fitted relation between reddening and galactic column density for a constant gas - to - dust ratio ( burstein & heiles 1978 ) .",
    "magnitude corrections due to emission lines were made as described in marshall ( 1983 ) .",
    "the luminosities at @xmath10 are calculated by assuming an optical spectral index @xmath43 .    in   5.1 we study the luminosity correlation between the optical and x - ray bands .",
    "then we investigate the distribution of the x - ray - to - optical luminosity ratio in   5.2 , and a study of its dependence on and",
    "is presented in   5.3 .",
    "the proper treatment of redshift effects is one of the biggest difficulties in the investigation of luminosity correlations . as our sample is relatively large , we are able to minimize these effects by using objects within a narrow redshift bin . for the analysis",
    "we consider objects with @xmath157 only , since at @xmath158 the low fraction of x - ray detections of our sample ( @xmath159 , see fig .",
    "3 ) can hardly yield reliable results .",
    "we split the redshift range @xmath160 into 9 bins with a bin size of 0.1 .",
    "the changes of the luminosity distance square within a redshift bin of @xmath161 are about factors of 4 and 1.2 at @xmath162 and @xmath163 , respectively , which is small compared to the corresponding range of luminosities of more than one order of magnitude .",
    "the objects within a single redshift bin can thus be regarded as being at approximately the same distance .    for the subsample of each bin we tested the  correlation , using a spearman correlation test incorporating upper limits ( using the survival analysis software asurv ; rev 1.3 , lavalley 1992 ) .",
    "the probability level for rejecting the `` no correlation '' hypothesis , @xmath164 , ranges from @xmath165 to @xmath166 , with a median of @xmath167 for all nine subsamples .",
    "the weakest correlation ( @xmath168 ) occurs in the lowest redshift bin , @xmath169  0.10.2 , where the intrinsic luminosity range is rather small ( @xmath170 ) .",
    "we thus confirm the correlation between and being an intrinsic property for most objects of the quasar population at redshifts @xmath171 , rather than a distance or a selection effect .",
    "however , despite the presence of a significant correlation the data points show a rather large scatter around the regression line . part of the scatter in the low-(@xmath172 ) bins , which show relatively large @xmath164 values , comes from a few objects showing rather weak x - ray luminosities compared to their optical luminosities ( @xmath173 ) , deviating from the rest of the subsample .",
    "excluding objects with @xmath174 ( for details see   5.2 ) yielded generally reduced @xmath164 values except in the @xmath175 bin .",

    "it shows that for most of the objects roughly scales with over about two orders of magnitudes , though with large scatter .",

    "further , we note that the modified orthogonal distance regression method ( fv , fasano & vio 1988 ) shows that there is significant dispersion in the data indicating that there is not the same strict one - to - one correlation between the two variables for all of the objects . an explanation for this result could be that the quasar sample does not form a homogeneous group of objects or that , for example , the orientation of the quasar to the line of sight affects the correlation given that x - rays and optical flux do not show the same angular dependence .      to find the intrinsic distribution of the x - ray loudness we used a maximum - likelihood method , the `` detections and bounds '' or db method developed by avni ( 1980 , 1995 ) which takes into account both detections and upper limits ( lower limits for ) for the non - detections .",
    "this method gives reliable results only for randomly distributed censored data .",

    "these low redshift sources were detected in pointed observations only , except pg 0844 + 349 ( at a high state ) and pg 1001 + 05 , which were also seen in the rass .",
    "in fact , the non - detection of these objects in the rass is the major cause of the reduced detection rate at bright magnitudes ( @xmath45 ) as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "amongst the 20 nearby quasars with @xmath212 in our optically selected sample , there are 3 of these `` x - ray quiet '' objects .",

    "it is not clear whether these objects are the x - ray quiet extremes of a continuous distribution or a distinct class of objects .",
    "we note , however , that x - ray variability might play a role in these objects ; for example , pg 0844 + 349 appears to be `` x - ray quiet '' only in its low state .",
    "in addition , the possibility for some of them being previously unknown bal objects , which remain undetected in soft x - rays ( green 1995 , green & mathur 1996 ) , can not be ruled out as well .",
    "excluding the 6 objects with @xmath174 and the two objects with lower limits of @xmath211 , we obtained for the remaining 371 detected objects and 987 non - detections a slightly reduced mean and standard deviation ( @xmath213 , @xmath214 ) , and a reduced best estimate for the skewness = @xmath215 , i.e. , compatible with a symmetric distribution around the mean .",

    "12 we show the joint 90% confidence contours for @xmath284 and @xmath285 ( two interesting parameters ) for the subsample ( solid line ) , with the best estimates of @xmath286 and @xmath287 .",
    "the results are consistent with those from the above non - parametric method and with previous studies ( kriss & canizares 1985 , avni & tananbaum 1986 , wilkes 1994 ) , showing a dependence of on @xmath243 , but not on redshift @xmath52 . excluding objects with @xmath139 and @xmath288 , as mentioned above , leads to similar results ( dotted line ) . considering only low-@xmath52 objects ( @xmath2 ) ,",
    "however , the contours ( dashed line ) show a slight dependence on @xmath52 ( an increase of by @xmath289 from the present epoch to half the hubble time , i.e. , @xmath290 , for the best fitted @xmath291 ) , at 90% confidence level , in addition to the dependence on @xmath243 .",
    "the dependence of on at low redshifts ( @xmath2 ) , found in a non - parametric way above , is confirmed .    in summary ,",
    "our analyses show a dependence of on @xmath243 rather than on @xmath52 .",
    "two new features can be noted : up to @xmath292 , radio - quiet quasars , mostly the low - objects ( @xmath275 ) , show a slight increase in with @xmath52 .",
    "secondly , the  log  dependence is complex and the increase of with is significant only for @xmath293 .    it should be noted that the @xmath133 objects have on average the lowest optical luminosities among the quasar population but higher than those of seyfert  i galaxies which have a mean @xmath14 1.25 ( kriss & canizares 1985 ) .",
    "thus , our low-_z _ , low - sample might be contaminated by objects with quasar luminosities but still having sy  i - type properties . these objects would not be detected at higher redshifts and could thus lead to the observed dependence with redshift .    finally ,",
    "the increase of with @xmath243 , inferred from the statistical analysis of the data , can not necessarily be interpreted as an intrinsic relationship of the quasar population . in paper  i we have demonstrated that the apparent @xmath51 ",
    "@xmath243 correlation can emerge even for an intrinsically uncorrelated sample , due to the inherent large dispersion in the scaling law between and and the flux limitations of the observations , leading to a rhomboidal shaped phase space diagram ( fig .",
    "19 of paper  i ) . a detailed monte carlo simulation , addressing the question whether an underlying truly physical correlation can be extracted from the data in the presence of these biases will be presented elsewhere ( yuan 1997 ) .",
    "we have presented the x - ray spectra and flux densities for 846 radio - quiet quasars detected by rosat in both the all - sky survey and in pointed observations .",
    "this is the largest sample of x - ray detected radio - quiet quasars published so far , with many of the objects ( @xmath14 70% ) being detected in x - rays for the first time .",
    "we studied the broad band properties of the population by using a sub - sample of optically selected , radio - quiet quasars from this compilation , which comprises 644 detections .",
    "the large number of objects enables us to investigate their properties in a wide range of parameter space with high statistical significance .",
    "our major results are the following :    \\1 . for radio - quiet quasars we found a systematically lower and much faster decreasing x - ray detection probability in the rass towards faint optical magnitudes and high redshifts than for radio - loud objects ( paper  i ) .",
    "the on average higher x - ray luminosity of radio - loud quasars can account for these differences qualitatively .",
    "a large fraction of the quasars , observed more than once in pointed observations , shows moderate flux variations , mostly by less than a factor of two .",
    "extreme flux variations ( by a factor of six ) were found for only one radio - quiet object ( pg  0844 + 349 ) .",
    "we confirm that radio - quiet quasars have in general steeper soft x - ray spectra (= @xmath1 for @xmath2 ) than radio - loud objects ( @xmath3 and @xmath106 , compared to flat- and steep - spectrum radio quasars , respectively ) and that this spectral difference persists at @xmath6 with @xmath5 compared to the flat - spectrum quasars ( paper  i ) .",
    "it is also confirmed that the soft x - ray spectra in the rosat band are systematically steeper than those in the harder @xmath247 ipc band by @xmath294 .",
    "\\4 . a spectral flattening with redshift",
    "is also confirmed for radio - quiet objects , which can be described by a linear relation of the form @xmath295 , for @xmath296 . as for the class of radio - loud quasars , the spectral slopes appear to be independent of redshift beyond @xmath7 . a decrease of the dispersion of the distribution of spectral slopes with redshift ( from @xmath297 for @xmath2 to @xmath298 for @xmath8 ) is also inferred , though the significance is not high .",
    "these results are consistent with a composite x - ray spectral model including an additional steep soft x - ray component .    \\5 .",
    "the spectral slope of @xmath9 found for the rosat radio - quiet quasars at high redshifts ( @xmath8 ) , is consistent , within the errors , with those found for nearby quasars in the medium energy x - ray band ( 210  kev ) of @xmath299 .",
    "this implies that x - ray spectral evolution is not important in radio - quiet quasars .",
    "the steep spectra of radio - quiet quasars seen at @xmath8 strengthen the claims that they can not be the dominant contributors to the cosmic x - ray background .",
    "the data are , in a statistical sense , consistent with no or only little excess absorption at all redshifts for radio - quiet quasars , though the significance of the result beyond @xmath7 is not high .",
    "\\7 . by dividing the sample into narrow redshift bins ( @xmath161 ) for @xmath157 ,",
    "the correlation between the x - ray luminosity and the luminosity at @xmath10 is explicitly tested and proved to be an intrinsic property of the quasar population , though a large scatter is present in the correlation .",
    "the slopes of the regression line , obtained from different mathematical methods , cover a wide range , @xmath300 .",
    "the existence of an intrinsic non - zero dispersion in the correlation between x - ray and optical luminosities suggest the existence of an additional `` variable '' , not accounted for in the analysis .",
    "one possibility would be a non - uniform , orientation dependent attenuation of the fluxes in the different energy bands .",
    "\\8 . in accordance with previous studies",
    ", the x - ray loudness seems to be independent of redshift but to correlate with @xmath243 .",
    "log  dependence is complex : the increase of with is significant only for @xmath293 and the low - radio - quiet quasars show a slight increase of with @xmath52 up to @xmath292 .",
    "however , this correlation might be primarily caused by luminosity selection biases and by the intrinsic dispersion of the data , as already discussed in paper  i for radio loud quasars .",
    "a detailed study of these effects by monte carlo simulations will be presented elsewhere ( yuan 1997 ) .",
    "highly reduced x - ray emission , by more than a factor of @xmath28 compared to the bulk of the objects , is found in a few objects in the high - tail of the distribution .",
    "there are eight such `` x - ray quiet '' objects below @xmath2 , six detected by rosat and two upper limits , having @xmath244 .",
    "the reason for the low x - ray emission of these objects is unknown ; we note , however , that x - ray variability might play a role .",
    "for example , the highly variable object pg 0844 + 349 is classified as `` x - ray quiet '' only in its low state .",
    "the rosat project is supported by the bundesministerium fr bildung , wissenschaft , forschung und technologie ( bmbf ) and the max - planck - gesellschaft .",
    "we thank our colleagues from the rosat group for their support , and m. veron - cetty for supplying a machine readable form of their catalogue .",
