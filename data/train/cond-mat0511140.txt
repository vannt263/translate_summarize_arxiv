    "this result can be improved when next - neighbored two  body increments ( denoted as nn ",

    "it can be noticed that including only one  body increments and two  body increments in the calculation reproduces almost the correlation contribution of the whole molecule .",
    "the same can be noticed when the epstein - nesbet theory to second order ( en2 ) is applied to calculate the correlation contribution .",
    "the results are depicted in the third column . here the values are somewhat increased with respect to the mp2 results , because beside the fock contributions of the diagonal elements of @xmath36 the coulomb -and the exchange contributions of the diagonal elements of @xmath36 are included in en2 while mp2 only considers the fock contributions of the diagonal elements of @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "the calculated values obtained by applying a full diagonalization for all one  body increments is given in the fourth column .",
    "the results show notedly the local properties of the correlation contributions , since the one  body increments include the main part of the correlation energies apart form a little difference which mainly is included in the two  body increments .",
    "the same observation can be made for the transmission coefficient .",
    "the full correlation contribution ( in the sense that all increments are accounted for , meaning the entire molecule has been correlated ) is approximated by just considering one  body and two  body increments ( s and d ) .",
    "so it can be stated that it is unnecessary to include n  body increments with @xmath37 .",
    "this fact gives rise to an important conclusion : the numerical effort for the correlation calculation can be lowered drastically .",
    "for this purpose the one  body increments are treated by full diagonalization because they include the main part of the correlation while the two  body increments could even be treated by perturbation theory .    in all of the following calculations , however , diagonalization is performed for all increments and the basis set a is employed .",
    "higher ordered increments will again be shown to be of minor significance .",

    "including all two  body increments brings the homo - lumo gap down by another 1.711  ev . these calculations were done without coupling to the gold electrodes .",
    "once the coupling is switched on , the landauer theory allows to calculate the transmission coefficient t. in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmetabenz ] t is calculated in dependence of the coupling @xmath27 .",
    "varying @xmath27 might be thought of as modeling different geometries at the junctions continuously , for example the distance between the electrodes and the molecule . in order to establish the connection to more realistic descriptions we have run a test calculation to estimate typical values of the gold ",

    "the transmission sets on as soon as a finite @xmath27 is chosen and then increases monotonously with @xmath27 to a peak value at around 8ev . with still increasing coupling the transmission",
    "then declines again .",
    "the interpretation of this behaviour is as follows : as the coupling is switched on , the thiol states will hybridize with the gold atoms , leading to a broadening of the respective molecular states at the gap , pressing electron density into the former homo - lumo gap .",
    "conductance then becomes possible . with ever increasing coupling",
    "the broadening of the molecular states then leads to distributing electronic density into the tales of the spectrum away from the gap region , thus lowering the transmission again .",
    "the overall tendency is the same for hf and correlated results .",
    "the role of the correlation corrections is to increase the transmission across the junction quantitatively to some extent .",
    "selected typical values of @xmath27 are taken to investigate the incremental scheme .",
    "[ tab : metabenz ] displays the results for the transmission coefficient t. the denomination of the rows is as above with s referring to one  body increments only and s+d including the two  body corrections as well .",
    "calculations were done for three different values of the external coupling parameter @xmath27 , corresponding to the increasing branch ( 4  ev ) , the peak region ( 6  ev ) and the decreasing branch ( 10  ev ) of the graph in fig .",

    "( as estimated above a typical covalent situation would be expected to be situated between 4 and 5 ev ) .    in all three cases the hf values",
    "are corrected to some extent by the one  body increments .",
    "the two  body increments then only give minor corrections being an order of magnitude smaller . for @xmath39  ev the hf value of 0.576 is corrected by the one  body increments by an amount of 0.048 or 8% to 0.624 .",
    "the inclusion of two  body increments only contributes another 0.007 .",
    "this drop establishes the rapid convergence of the incremental scheme .      for the sake of comparison and to elucidate the role of the @xmath40system we also did calculations on the para ",

    "contrary to its meta  version it has an inversion symmetry with respect to its center of mass .",
    "nonetheless we decided to split the carbon ring again into two asymmetric parts , a larger one ( region iv , upper part ) and a smaller one in the lower part , denoted as part ii .",
    "we would like to use the incremental scheme to investigate how the different parts contribute to the correlation effects .",
    "the results are shown in tab .",

    "most correlation corrections are assessed with the one  body increments , which correct the hf value of the homo - lumo gap of 11.309  ev by an amount of 6.021  ev .",
    "inclusion of two  body increments leads to an additional correction of 1.041  ev , while the three  body increments together only amount to another -0.003  ev .",
    "this confirms that converged results are already obtained on the two  body increment level and justifies the cutoff applied to the incremental series after the two  body contributions for the calculations on the meta  dithiolbenzene in the previous section .",
    "it is important to note that the incremental scheme thus allows for a well  monitored and significant simplification in the numerical effort , since the space to be diagonalized for two  body increments is in general significantly smaller than with three regions included .",
    "as can be seen from the last column in tab .",
    "[ tab : parabenz ] , these findings are confirmed for the transmission coefficient @xmath1 in very much the same way . as for the case of meta  dithiolbenzene , the convergence is even faster than for the gap correction . the hf value is changed from 0.274 by 0.054 or 20% to 0.328 by the one  body increments alone .",
    "body increments only correct by -0.006 and three  body increments contribute a meager -0.001 .",
    "we now turn to an analysis of the carbon ring contributions . to this end",
    "we check explicitly the combinations of the two  body increments where one part of the ring is associated with the left thiol  bridge or where both parts are included and register their influence on the gap correction .",
    "the upper and lower part ( increments iv and ii ) are combined with the left thiol  group ( region i in the right panel of fig.[fig - incscheme ] ) to give the combinations 1 + 4 and 1 + 2 , respectively , in tab .",

    "the scheme has been carried over from the case of translationally invariant systems to heterogeneous systems such as molecular junctions .",
    "the theory combines different ideas into a feasible procedure and has been put forth in detail .",
    "the construction of the green function and related quantities was exemplified by calculations on para and meta  dithiolbenzene .",
