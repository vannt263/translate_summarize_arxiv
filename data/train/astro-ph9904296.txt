    "understanding the diffuse microwave emission from the galaxy is crucial for doing cosmology with cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies .",
    "although three components of galactic emission have been firmly identified ( and free - free radiation , and thermal emission from dust particles ) , it is important to better quantify their frequency dependence and spatial distribution ( see , , kogut 1996a ; tegmark 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "cross - correlations of cmb data with far - ir maps have shown the existence of a microwave emission component whose spatial distribution is traced by these maps ( kogut 1996b ; lim 1996 ; de oliveira - costa 1997 ; leitch 1997 ; de oliveira - costa 1998 , hereafter doc98 ) .",
    "although this emission component has a spectral index suggestive of free - free emission ( kogut 1999 ) , the correlations between h@xmath2 and dust maps have been found to be marginal ( mccullough 1997 ; kogut 1997 ) .",
    "the source of this correlated emission is therefore an open question .",
    "recent work suggests that it originates from spinning dust grain emission ( draine and lazarian 1998 ) , which should have a spectral index of @xmath3 between 19 and 53  ghz .",
    "since spinning dust grains have a predicted turndown in their emission at frequencies below 20  ghz , a cross - correlation analysis with lower frequency measurements may help to discriminate between free - free and spinning dust emission models .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to evaluate the galactic contribution in the tenerife 10 and 15  ghz data sets by cross - correlating them with the dirbe dust maps and with the haslam and reich and reich maps .",
    "our analysis is based on the tenerife measurements made up until the end of 1997 ( gutirrez 1999 , hereafter g99 ) .",
    "the tenerife switched - beam experiment is a sky survey between @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( figure  1 shows a sample strip at @xmath6 ) carried out at an angular resolution of @xmath7 fwhm with an instrument that uses a double - differencing technique .",
    "data was taken at frequencies 10 and 15  ghz ( we omit the 33  ghz data here due to lack of low latitude sky coverage ) , which are treated separately in order to gain additional frequency information on galactic emission .",
    " scan of the tenerife region @xmath8 for @xmath9 .",
    "the thin curve shows tenerife 15  ghz data , while the thicker curve represents dirbe 100convolved with the tenerife triple - beam , rescaled for best fit .",
    "the spikes at ra@xmath10 and @xmath11 correspond to the galactic plane crossings .",
    "[ figten1 ]",
    "the tenerife data consists of @xmath12 pixels at each frequency with double - differenced sky temperatures @xmath13 and noise @xmath14 .",
    "we assume that this data is a linear superposition of cmb fluctuations @xmath15 and @xmath16 galactic components whose angular distributions are traced in part by external foreground templates .",
    "writing these contributions as @xmath17-dimensional vectors , we obtain = + _ cmb + , where @xmath18 is an @xmath19 matrix whose rows contain the various foreground templates convolved with the tenerife triple - beam ( , @xmath20 would be the @xmath21 observation if the sky had looked like the @xmath22 foreground template ) , and @xmath23 is a vector of size @xmath16 that gives the levels at which these foreground templates are present in the tenerife data .",
    "we treat @xmath24 and @xmath25 as uncorrelated random vectors with zero mean , and the matrix @xmath18 as constant ; thus the data covariance matrix is given by - = + .",
    "the tenerife noise covariance matrix @xmath26 is , to good approximation , diagonal ( see gutirrez de la cruz 1995 ) , while the cmb covariance matrix has the form _",
    "l=-1 ^ 1 w_k w_l   c(_ik _ jl ) , where the vector @xmath27 gives the weights of the three lobes in the tenerife triple beam , @xmath28 is the direction that the central lobe pointed to during the @xmath21 observation , and @xmath29 is at the same declination but offset by @xmath30 on the sky .",
    "we take the cmb correlation function to be c(_ik _ jl ) = c ( ) _ =2^b_^2 c_p_ ( ) for a flat power spectrum @xmath31 normalized to a q@xmath32 ( g99 ) .",
    "finally , we model the tenerife beam as a fisher function ( fisher 1987 ) b( ) = with fwhm@xmath33 , which gives a window function @xmath34 .",
    "the fisher function is locally gaussian and integrates to unity over the unit sphere .    since our goal is to measure @xmath23 , both @xmath24 and @xmath25 act as unwanted noise in . minimizing @xmath35 yields the minimum - variance estimate of @xmath23 , = ^-1 ^t   * c*^-1   , with covariance matrix - ^2 = ^-1 .",
    "the error bars on individual correlations are therefore @xmath36 .",
    "this includes the effect of chance alignments between the cmb and the various template maps , since the cmb anisotropy term is incorporated in @xmath37 .",
    "due to the double - differencing technique , the tenerife data are insensitive to the monopole ( @xmath38 ) and dipole ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "accordingly , when we convolve the template maps with the tenerife triple beam function , we are removing the mean of the templates as well as large angular scale structure . as a consequence ,",
    "our results depend predominantly on the small scale intensity variations in the templates ( @xmath40 ) and are insensitive to the zero levels and gradients in the cmb and the template maps .",
    "@xmath41 the dirbe and haslam correlations listed in this table correspond to joint 100@xmath42has fits , whereas the r&r numbers correspond to a joint 100@xmath42r&r fit .",

    "we cross - correlate the tenerife data with two different templates : the 408  mhz survey ( haslam 1981 ) and the 1420  mhz survey ( reich and reich 1988 ) , hereafter has and r&r , respectively . to study dust and/or free - free emission , we cross -",
    "correlate the tenerife data with three diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ) sky maps at wavelengths 100 , 140 and 240  @xmath48 ( boggess 1992 ) .",
    "the extent of point source contamination in the tenerife data is discussed and estimated in g99 , and therefore will not be addressed in this . in practice , we just remove the estimated point sources contribution before calculating the correlations . for definiteness , we use the dirbe 100@xmath48 channel when placing all limits below since it is the least noisy of the three dirbe channels , and the haslam map since it is the template at lowest frequency .",
    "table  1 shows the coefficients @xmath44 and the corresponding fluctuations in antenna temperature in the tenerife data ( @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the standard deviation of the template map ) .",
    "the analysis is done for three different cuts : @xmath51 and the _ tenerife cut _ ( which consists of data with @xmath52 , corresponding to galactic latitudes @xmath53 ) .",
    "note that the fits are done jointly for @xmath54 templates .",
    "the dirbe and haslam correlations listed in table  1 correspond to joint 100@xmath42has fits , whereas the r&r numbers correspond to a joint 100@xmath42r&r fit .",
    "statistically significant ( @xmath55 ) correlations are listed in boldface .",
    "the two templates are found to be correlated with the 10  ghz data at low galactic latitudes and this correlation persists with the has template even at higher latitudes , while the 15  ghz data is not correlated with these templates even for a @xmath56 cut .",
    "the 100@xmath48 and 10  ghz data are correlated only at lower galactic latitudes ( @xmath56 cut ) , while the correlation with the 15  ghz data persists to higher latitudes .",
    "the same analysis was carried out for the dirbe 140@xmath48 and 240@xmath48 maps , giving very similar results .      to investigate the dependence of the correlation on galactic latitude",
    ", we sliced the maps into six regions of equal area , each corresponding to a range of latitude @xmath57 .",
    "figure  2 shows the results for the 100@xmath48 map .",
    "note that @xmath44 from the 100@xmath48@xmath5815  ghz correlation is similar in all latitude bands , suggesting that the particular ism properties that are responsible for the correlation do not vary strongly with latitude .",
    " dependence of @xmath44 on galactic latitude for the 100@xmath48@xmath58correlated emission at 15 ghz .",
    "[ figten2 ]      writing the frequency dependence as @xmath59 , we obtain interesting limits on the spectral index @xmath60 .",
    "for synchrotron radiation , both the has@xmath5810  ghz and the r&r@xmath5810  ghz correlations are consistent with @xmath61 in all latitude slices .",
    "the most favored values between 408  mhz and 10  ghz values ( @xmath62 ) are slightly steeper than the canonical sub - ghz slope of @xmath63 ( davies 1998 ; platania 1998 ) .",
    "such a steepening of the spectrum at higher frequencies is consistent with a steepening of the spectrum of cosmic ray electrons at higher energies ( rybicki and lightman 1979 ) . for the emission component correlated with the 100@xmath64 m map",
    ", the spectral index between 10 and 15  ghz is @xmath65 for @xmath66 , and the spectrum is also clearly rising at @xmath67 ( see table  1 ) .",
    "calibration uncertainties are below 5% in the tenerife data at both 10 and 15 ghz , and therefore do not affect the conclusions that we will draw from this spectral behavior",
    ".      shows that we can interpret @xmath68 as measuring correlations between the various templates .",
    "table  2 shows the dimensionless correlation coefficients @xmath69 , using the 10 ghz pixel weighting , and enables a number of conclusions to be drawn :    1 .",
    "the three dirbe maps are , as expected , highly correlated , , they trace the same warm dust emission ; 2 .",
    "the two maps are less well correlated , with only @xmath70 of the variance in the has map being traced by the r&r map at @xmath66 cut , and even less at higher latitudes ; and 3 .",
    "all three dirbe maps are seen to be almost uncorrelated with both radio maps , with the common variance @xmath71 being only a few percent .",
    "this means that @xmath72 is almost diagonal , and that simply performing a separate correlation analysis for each component ( with @xmath73 , as was done in , de oliveira - costa 1997 ; doc98 ) will give almost identical results to a joint ( @xmath74 ) analysis .",
    "we tested this , and indeed obtained results in good agreement with those presented in subsection [ corrandvar ] ) .",
    "@xmath41 the upper right triangle of the table uses a @xmath66 cut and the lower left triangle a @xmath75 cut .",
    "we tested our software by analyzing constrained realizations of the cmb and the tenerife instrument noise .",
    "cholesky decomposing the covariance matrix as @xmath76 , we generated fake skies using @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is a vector of independent gaussian random variables with @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( the identity matrix ) , which gives @xmath81 . analyzing 1000 such realizations",
    ", we recovered unbiased estimates @xmath44 with a variance in agreement with .",
    "systematic errors or unmodeled foregrounds may add non - gaussian fluctuations to the the data set @xmath82 , making the true error bars larger than suggested by . to address this issue , we repeated the fit done in after replacing the template map with a set of `` control '' patches selected from different portions in the sky .",
    "we repeated the analysis with 24 @xmath83 2 @xmath83 2 = 96 transformed maps , rotated around the galactic axis by multiples of 15@xmath84 and/or flipped vertically and/or horizontally .",
    "the correct haslam template has the highest of all 96 correlations with the 10  ghz data . even for a @xmath53 cut , 95 of the 96 patches ( or 99% of them )",
    "are less correlated with the the 10  ghz data than the correct 100@xmath48 patch .",
    "the same test was carried out for other galactic cuts and the 15  ghz data , giving similar results .",
    "these results show that our correlations are not due to systematic errors or chance alignments between the cmb and the various template maps .",
    "we also applied the rotation test to the foreground template correlations in table  2 .",
    "although as mentioned above , the dust - synchrotron correlations are tiny ( @xmath85 ) and negligible for our purposes , they are still statistically significant ; for a 40@xmath84 galactic cut , the correct synchrotron template ( has or r&r ) has the highest of all 96 correlations with the dirbe map .",
    "we have detected high - latitude galactic foreground signals in the tenerife data at high ( @xmath86 ) statistical significance , summarized in figure  3 .",
    "the synchrotron signal is consistent with previous upper limits ( kogut 1996b ) and detections ( doc98 ) , and provides a useful normalization for modeling microwave foregrounds .",
    "we also verify that the 15 ghz _ tenerife - cut _ data is useful for cmb cosmology ; although the dirbe - correlated component is statistically significant , it is much smaller in amplitude than the primary cosmological signal .",
    "our results indicate that the dirbe - correlated signal may turn out to be the dominant foreground seen by the the map satellite . what is its physical origin ?",
    "a `` smoking gun '' indication of spinning dust grains would be a turnover in the spectrum , since all draine and lazarian models show such a feature whereas the antenna temperature of free - free emission continues to rise with @xmath87 towards lower frequencies .",
    "figure  3 combines our present results with previous measurements .",
    "the lower panel shows that the synchrotron spectrum is well fit by a power law @xmath88 with @xmath61 ( cyan line ) . in the upper panel ,",
    "the dashed curve shows the spectrum for a best fit linear combination of vibrational ( green ) and rotational ( yellow ) dust emission .",
    "the vibrational spectrum assumes a 20k dust temperature and an emissivity of 2 .",
    "the rotational spectrum is the warm interstellar medium model of draine and lazarian ( 1998 ) from _ www.astro.princeton.edu/@xmath89draine/_. a joint three - parameter fit , including free - free emission with spectrum @xmath90 as a third component ( magenta ) , prefers negligible amounts of free - free above 10 ghz . on purely physical grounds ,",
    "free - free emission must of course be present at some level .",
    "however , if the 10 ghz tenerife correlation were entirely due to free - free emission , this component would explain only about 10% of the variance observed at 15 ghz and a percent of the variance in the saskatoon data .",
    "the interpretation of such fits that directly compare data points from different experiments is complicated by conversions between different angular scales ( doc98 ) .",
    "however , a direct comparison between the 10 and 15 ghz tenerife points from this work is straightforward , since the angular resolution and window functions are the same , and gives a spectral index of @xmath91 .",
    "this is clearly inconsistent with free - free emission , and provides evidence that the main culprit is indeed spinning dust .",

    " frequency dependence of dirbe - correlated emission ( top ) and haslam - correlated emission ( bottom ) .",
    "the dirbe - correlated emission is seen to be approximately fit by a combination of spinning and vibrating dust ( dashed curve ) , whereas free - free emission alone ( falling straight line ) can not explain the drop from 15 to 10 ghz .",
