    "the @xmath0 form of carbon , carbyne , has proved more elusive than its @xmath2 ( diamond ) and @xmath1 ( graphite / graphene ) counterparts .",
    "recently , also in view of the potential exciting applications @xcite @xmath0 carbon chains ( spccs , or carbynes ) are being produced in significant amount and investigated extensively .",
    "besides synthetic routes @xcite leading to spccs bonded to molecular ligands and various mechanical or electromagnetic methods @xcite addressing the single spcc , carbyne has been formed in substantial amounts ( together with other carbon clusters ) via homogenous reactions within the hot plasma produced by an electric discharge at the surface of a graphite electrode @xcite . despite their high reactivity ,",
    "a significant fraction of these carbynes survive landing on a solid surface , where they are typically stabilized by grafting to other carbon clusters , mainly of @xmath1 hybridization @xcite . after deposition ,",
    "carbynes are detected in the nanostructured film by various kinds of spectroscopies @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we investigate the early formation stages of spccs at the interface of a graphite electrode with a hot plasma .",
    "specifically , we investigate the length distribution @xmath3 of c@xmath4 chains , and its dependence on the temperature of the hot plasma and on the local density of the available carbon material .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath3 and its temperature dependence can provide information useful for the tuning of the plasma properties , in view of an optimization of the formation of carbynes of a desired length . a previous simulation work @xcite used a similar model to investigate the transformation of @xmath0 structures into ordered structure , such as fullerenes and nanotubes under thermal annealing . here",
    "we focus instead on a quantitative characterization of the initial formation of the carbynes , in a high - density , high - temperature plasma plume .",
    "a reliable description of the @xmath5 interconversion requires a transferable description of carbon binding in its different hybridizations . in view of these requirements",
    ", we adopt a well - established tight - binding ( tb ) model for the adiabatic potential of a carbon - only material @xcite . in [ validation : sec ] we validate the adopted model against _ ab - initio _ density functional theory ( dft ) simulations , in the local spin - density approximation ( lsda ) . as is standard in the literature of the field @xcite , we evaluate the hellmann - feynman forces @xcite for an efficient simulation of the classical time evolution of the ions of the carbon material .",
    "we adopt a graphene nanoribbon to represent the initial state of the @xmath1-carbon sacrificial electrode . a graphitic multilayer would make little difference because the adopted tb force field is rather short ranged and does not include van - der - waals interactions .",
    "the infinite nanoribbon is represented by a @xmath1 carbon stripe inside a parallelepiped simulation cell , to which we apply periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) , see fig .  [",
    "grafene - ribbon : fig ] .",
    "we simulate the heat exchanges of the sample with the hot plasma and the bulk of the carbon electrode by means of a standard langevin thermostat @xcite .",
    "the equation of motion of each carbon atoms is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the momentum of atom @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the ( hellmann - feynman ) force acting on atom @xmath8 due to the interaction with all other atoms in the sample , @xmath10 is a gaussian - distributed stochastic force representing the collisions of atom @xmath8 with the hot plasma , and @xmath11 is the phenomenological parameter accounting for the rate of heat exchange with the thermostat @xcite .",
    "we integrate these equations numerically with a @xmath12  fs time step .",
    "the other simulation details are summarized in table  [ tab : sim ] .",
    ".[tab : sim ] the general conditions used for the considered groups of simulations .",
    "the density is changed by varying the size of the simulation box in the direction perpendicular to the plane initially containing the nanonribbon . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the detachment of one or multiple carbynes is an endothermic process requiring the concentration of energy at some point of the sample .",
    "this barrier energy @xmath13 , in the ev range , is provided at the expense of the sample thermal energy , and it is eventually restored to the whole sample by the thermostat .",
    "this scheme configures the `` series '' of two processes occurring at definite rates : ( i ) the carbyne formation itself , at an intrinsic rate @xmath14 , and ( ii ) the transfer of heat from the thermostat , at a rate @xmath11 . as these processes are not concurrent ( in parallel ) but sequential ( in series , like chains of radioactive decays ) , the overall rate @xmath15 satisfies @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a dimensionless coefficient of order unity .",
    "@xmath15 is extracted by fitting the initial linearly - increasing region of the computed @xmath18 as a function of time , as in fig .",
    "[ chains_dependence_from_temperature : fig ] , and specifically fig .",
    "[ fit : fig]a . given these values of @xmath15 computed at varied @xmath19 and @xmath11",
    ", we extract the intrinsic formation time @xmath20 for a spcc by fitting the observed @xmath21 as a function of @xmath22 .",
    "the data are compatible with a straight line , see fig .",
    "[ fit : fig]b . according to eq .",
    "( [ tau : eq ] ) , the intercept at @xmath23 provides precisely @xmath24 .",
    "we repeat this procedure for different temperature , and obtain the intrinsic formation time @xmath24 , listed in table  [ tab : tau ] .    figure  [ arrhenius : fig ] reports the obtained rates @xmath14 as a function of the inverse temperature .",
    "the variation of the intrinsic formation rate @xmath14 is compatible with an arrhenius law @xmath25 the estimated barrier @xmath26  ev , of course in agreement with the carbyne breakup energy of fig .",
    "[ compare : fig ] in [ validation : sec ] .",
    "the attempt rate @xmath27  s@xmath28 is quite large compared to typical attempt rates of molecular chemical reactions .",
    "the reason is that this rate refers to the entire sample .",
    "an analogous analysis carried out for the total number @xmath29 of eroded carbon atoms ( also illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fit : fig ] and [ arrhenius : fig ] ) yields a similar barrier ( 4.38  ev ) and an approximately double attempt rate @xmath30  s@xmath28 .",
    "we can assume that @xmath14 and @xmath31 are rates appropriate for the length of @xmath1 carbon edges exposed to the plasma in our simulated sample ( fig .",
    "[ grafene - initial : fig ] ) , i.e.  approximately @xmath32  nm . since the inter - layer distance in graphite is @xmath33 nm , and accounting from orientational disorder , our sample is equivalent to an exposed erodible surface area of approximately @xmath34  nm@xmath35 . at a plausible temperature next to the graphite surface ,",
    "say 2500  k , the extrapolated intrinsic rate @xmath36  s@xmath28 is compatible with an erosion rate @xmath37  s@xmath28m@xmath38 , corresponding to @xmath39  kgs@xmath28m@xmath38 .",
    "this mass rate accounts for an erosion speed in the order of @xmath40  mm / s .",
    "this figure is quite close to the electrode erosion speed observed during the active plasma - pulse part of the source cycle in experiment @xcite . of this eroded carbon ,",
    "the fraction of `` native '' @xmath41 c@xmath4 carbynes is estimated to approximately @xmath42% at the same temperature of @xmath43  k ( assuming an average carbyne length of 5 ) .",
    "it is necessary to examine how the amount and fraction of formed spccs depends on the overall carbon density in the formation region . in the experimental conditions",
    ", the carbon density drops rapidly from that of bulk graphite inside the rod to a dilute - gas figure downstream in the carrier gas flux away from the surface .",
    "as it is currently impractical to determine the precise atomic density in the erosion region @xcite , we explore a range of densities .",
    "the data of fig .",
    "[ chains_dependence_from_density : fig ] ( see also figs .",
    "[ average_c_m_length_m : fig ] and [ sigma : fig ] ) indicate that the carbon density does not affect dramatically the carbyne formation .",
    "mostly , a higher density tends to increase slightly the early - time formation rate of carbynes , thus anticipating the time at which the number of formed carbynes is maximum .    until now ,",
    "all simulations represent solid carbon with the nanoribbon characterized by a zig - zag edge , as in figs .",
    "[ grafene - ribbon : fig ] and [ grafene - initial : fig ] . to make sure that the carbyne formation rate is not affected by this assumption , we simulate also a nanoribbon exposing an armchair edge .",
    "figure  [ armchair_zigzag : fig ] reports the comparison of the carbyne formation . while the armchair edge proves significantly more stable , with a slower initial rate of spcc formation , the observed difference is not especially large , approximately a factor two .",
    "we conclude that the explored zig - zag model is well suitable for estimating the rates , which it probably slightly overestimates compared to a random mix of zig - zag and armchair edges as in actual graphite .",
    "the adopted langevin - thermostat model represents a substantial idealization of the erosion of @xmath1 carbon interacting with a hot plasma .",
    "the significant inhomogeneity and temperature gradient occurring in the experimental setup are surely lacking in this model .",
    "all the same , the exploration of a range of temperature and densities shows that ( i ) temperature differences induce radical ( activated ) differences mainly in the overall production rate , but not on the long - time statistical properties of the formed carbynes ; ( ii ) density variations induce minor changes on the carbyne formation .",
    "these results suggest that , despite its limitations , the adopted tb model allows us to explore the carbon decomposition and carbyne formation in a qualitative , but also statistically quantitative way .    in experiment ,",
    "the carbynes and other produced clusters migrate into a cooler region where they may in part undergo fragmentation , recombination , and other transformations , including the synthesis of graphitic clusters , fullerenes , nanotubes , and amorphous structures .",
    "contrary to the described carbyne formation , the recombination phenomena , already studied in the past @xcite , depend crucially on the probability of encounter and quenching of primary clusters , which in turn depends on the density of available carbon material . accordingly ,",
    "also the carbyne depletion between their generation in the hottest part of the plasma plume and the final deposition can occur at a rate strongly dependent on the plasma - gas pressure and flux .",
    "further quantitative consideration of these phenomena may prove necessary in view of the direct interest in the formation of carbynes .",
    "we thank nicola ferri , giovanni onida , and paolo piseri for useful discussion .",
    "the adopted parametric tb model @xcite was constructed targeting mainly @xmath2 and @xmath1 carbon .",
    "its adoption to describe spccs should therefore be validated . to this purpose ,",
    "we perform _ ab - initio _ dft - lsda simulations of a stretched carbyne .",
    "we adopt a plane - waves basis ( cutoff : 30 rydberg ) and ultrasoft pseudopotentials to account for core electrons , as implemented in the quantum espresso code @xcite . to test the reliability of the adiabatic potential resulting in the tb model",
    ", we compare the the tb total - energy adiabatic surface with the one obtained by dft - lsda for a c@xmath44 chain .",
    "in particular , we consider the variation of the adiabatic energy as the central bond between atoms 6 and 7 is stretched , with all other bonds fully relaxed .",
    "figure  [ compare : fig ] reports this comparison .",
    "the minimum energy is realized at a very similar bond length , within 4  pm , and the curvature in the minimum region is quite comparable .",
    "the main deviations occur when the central bond is stretched beyond 200  pm , approaching the cutoff distance ( 260  pm ) of the tb model .",
    "the dangling bonds at the c@xmath44 ends produce a magnetic ( spin-1 ) dft ground state .",
    "the corresponding tb electronic structure exhibits a twofold - degenerate molecular orbital ( half-)occupied by 2 electrons at the fermi level . as the 6 - 7 bond",
    "is stretched , another level moves closer , until a further degeneracy is realized accounting for the two half - filled @xmath45 orbitals of the two identical c@xmath46 units . for @xmath47  pm , this degeneracy can be lifted by charge transfer of two electrons from one c@xmath46 fragment to the other , with a corresponding symmetry breaking and different bonding pattern of the two ions .",
    "this distortion leads to energy lowering , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ compare : fig ] .",
    "this distortion however is an artifact of the tb model , which allows it because the tb model lacks any realistic description of the electrostatic charging energy .",
    "no sign of this artifact is observed in the dft model , which instead switches from a total - spin @xmath48 to a @xmath49 state as @xmath50 exceeds @xmath51  pm .    despite the risk of charging artifacts such as the one described above",
    ", the lack of magnetic exchange , and the short range , the overall shape of the adiabatic potential is essentially satisfactory to the purpose of the present calculations .",
    "the bond - breakage energy is approximately 5.5  ev , not too far from the dft predicted value of approximately 8  ev .",
    "this underestimation of the binding energy , in turn , suggests that the stability of carbynes and thus the tendency to form them in real life exceeds the one predicted by the present model simulations ."
