    "the nebular heii @xmath7(4686@xmath8(h@xmath9 , measured by @xcite corresponds to a relatively high - excitation nebula .",
    "this pn has a moderate density of @xmath10(sii )  =  1220@xmath11 @xcite , which could be associated with a relatively hot central star ( cspn ) based on the evolutionary radiation - hydrodynamic models @xcite .",
    "this pn is indeed ionized by a very hot star classified as [ wo3]@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "previously , @xcite defined the [ wo]@xmath12 subclass as those with a _ peculiar _ civ 5805 full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , much wider than typical [ wo ] .",
    "similarly , @xcite identified the cspn th2-a as type [ wo]@xmath12 , belonging to those with _ peculiar _",
    "civ-5801/12 doublet . according to the transformation given by @xcite ,",
    "the strength of heii @xmath134686 relative to h@xmath14 describes a stellar temperature of @xmath15kk .",
    "however , the heii and [ oiii ] emission lines can also correspond to @xmath16kk based on the method introduced by @xcite .",
    "th2-a was found to contain a possible binary system @xcite .",
    "one component of the binary is a cspn , and another component is a visual late - type star separated by @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "however , the resolved companion could be a possible superposition .",
    "previously , @xcite described th2-a as pn with a well defined photometric center . although there are no detailed studies on the visual companion spectra , @xcite identified broad and intense civ and oiv emission lines in the cspn spectra , which made it one of the rare [ wo]@xmath12 stars .",
    "notwithstanding , if the nearby visual star is indeed a binary companion of the cspn , it unlikely contributes to the formation of the fast stellar winds identified in its spectra since its separation is 3500 au at the distance of 2.5kpc determined by @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present integral field spectroscopic mapping of th2-a , from which we derive a morpho - kinematic model of this object . currently , there are no previous morpho - kinematic studies on this object in the literature . in section  [ th2a",

    "the appearance of a prolate nebula viewed almost pole - on can become rectangular , when the density distribution along the shell decreases slightly with distance from the equator ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the high values of velocity dispersion seen at the central region could be related to high - velocity point - symmetric outflows toward the axis of a prolate ellipsoid viewed pole - on , which is easily noticeable in the channel maps ( see fig .",

    "note that the [ oiii ] emission typically occurs near inner regions of the nebula whose expansion velocity is lower than outer regions .",
    "however , measuring the expansion velocity by means of the hwhm method is not very fruitful for more detailed kinematic studies .",
    "the radiation - hydrodynamics models by @xcite showed that the hwhm velocities of volume - integrated line profiles always underestimate the true expansion velocity .",
    "the hwhm method is suitable for slowly expanding objects , but it does not reflects real expansion velocities of large spatially resolved objects .",

    "the systemic velocity @xmath44kms@xmath2 has been subtracted from the central velocity value given at the top of each channel .",
    "the stellar continuum map has also been subtracted from the flux intensity maps .",
    "while a prominent equatorial ring can be clearly seen in the @xmath45 and @xmath46kms@xmath2 channels , a pair of collimated bipolar outflows can be identified in the @xmath47 and @xmath48kms@xmath2 channels .",
    "this ring has a radius of @xmath49 and a thickness of @xmath50 .",
    "two different velocity components seen in the @xmath51 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath52kms@xmath2 channels are consistent with front and back walls of a toroidal shell expanding with a velocity of @xmath53kms@xmath2 .",
    "if we assume that this ring is a projection of a circle on the sky plane , the velocity channels correspond to a position angle ( p.a . ) of @xmath54 measured from the north toward the east in the equatorial coordinate system ( ecs ) . a brightness discontinuity seen at the central region in both directions , from the @xmath52 to @xmath48 ( @xmath51 to @xmath47)kms@xmath2 velocity slices ,",
    "is related to an environment change of collimated point - symmetric outflows emerging from the dense shell .",

    "to disentangle the three - dimensional gaseous structure of th2-a , we used the morpho - kinematic modeling tool shape ( version 5.0 ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this program has been used for many objects , such as hb 5 and k 3 - 17 @xcite , ngc 2392 @xcite , hen 3 - 1333 and hen 2 - 113 @xcite , and ngc 3242 @xcite .",

    "it produces several outputs that can be directly compared with observations , namely synthetic images and position  velocity ( p  v ) diagrams , and velocity channels .",

    "are iteratively modified until acceptable solutions are obtained .    to model th2-a",
    ", we used the h@xmath0 velocity slices presented in fig.[th2a : vmap ] since all the kinematic components are included in h@xmath0 emission rather [ nii ] emission due to the very high excitation feature of this nebula .",
    "the velocity channel maps of the morpho - kinematic model are closely compared with the observed channel maps .",
    "all these geometrical structures were slightly modified until the model outputs reasonably match the observational maps . as a starting point , a circular shell was assumed for the ring of th2-a .",
    "the velocity is defined as radially outward from the nebular center with a linear function of magnitude , commonly known as a hubble - type flow @xcite .",
    "the inclination angle of this shell was then manipulated until synthetic images at different velocity channels match the observational maps ( see the channels between @xmath51 and @xmath52kms@xmath2 ) .",

    "it explains the high velocity components seen in the @xmath56 , @xmath69 , @xmath48 and @xmath57kms@xmath2 channels ( see fig.[th2a : vmap ] ) .",
    "however , the length of the bipolar outflows can not precisely be constrained , as they are slightly oriented , relative to the line of sight ( inclination @xmath70 ) . assuming a homologous outflow , the distance of the bipolar outflow from the nebular center is nearly twice larger than the polar radius of the toroidal shell . from the model ,",
    "the collimated bipolar outflows are found to have a polar expansion velocity of @xmath71kms@xmath2 .    in figure",
