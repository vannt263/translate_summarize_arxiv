    "it is known that macroscopic properties of ferroelectrics are strongly dependent on domain walls , which are extended two - dimensional defects .",
    "any fundamental understanding of ferroelectricity in perovskites requires a detailed understanding of domain walls in the nanoscale as these defects are atomically sharp ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "theoretical studies of domain walls have revealed many of their interesting features . from both ab inito calculations @xcite and anaharmonic lattice statics calculations @xcite it is now known that ferroelectric domain walls are atomically sharp . in all these studies ,",
    "the structure calculations have been done for perfect domain walls and free of strain .",

    "strain may also have a significant effect on domain wall structure .",
    "it is known that the presence of point defects can have important effects on the properties of perovskites .",

    "it is known that oxygen vacancies move to the domain walls and pin them and thus we assume a periodic arrangement of oxygen vacancies on both pb - centered and ti - centered domain walls .",

    ", we observe that a pb - centered domain wall with oxygen vacancies is not stable even under strain .",
    "our semi - analytic solutions for pbtio@xmath1 show that oxygen vacancies increase the thickness of the domain wall by about fifty percent .",
    "this is different from the results of a recent experimental measurements of @xmath3 domain walls in pbtio@xmath1 using afm by @xcite .",
    "they observed that there is a large variation in domain wall thickness with respect to position ( @xmath4 nm ) .",
    "this is not very surprising as vacancies may interact differently with different types of domain walls . in our calculations , we observe that oxygen vacancies have a significant effect on the detailed structure of @xmath0 domain walls .",
    "our result is in agreement with a recent continuum study of interaction of oxygen vacancies with domain walls @xcite .",
    "xiao , et al.s continuum model predicts that @xmath0 and @xmath3 domain walls have quite different interactions with oxygen vacancies .",
    "there are several works in the literature on the effect of strain on ferroelectric domain walls showing that strain can have important effects on domain walls .",
    "for example , both experiments @xcite and ab initio calculations @xcite show that shear stress applied to @xmath3 domain walls in pbtio@xmath1 develops polarization reorientation through a domain wall movement perpendicular to itself known as stress - induced domain switching .",

    "they measured the surface topography of a given sample and compared it with a displacement field that is obtained from the devonshire - ginzburg - landau phenomenological model .",
    "they calculated the thickness of two domain walls at two different positions and observed thicknesses of @xmath5 nm and @xmath6 nm for the two domain walls .",
    "they then conjectured that presence of point defects is responsible for this variation .",
    "@xcite used a two - dimensional square lattice model that has a continuum order parameter interacting with a lattice of ising spins , where the ising spins model the presence or absence of point defects .",
    "they show that depending on the parameters used in their model , one can reproduce the main features of the experimentally observed variation in domain wall thickness in @xcite s experiments . however",
    ", one should note that shilo , et al.s results may not apply to all types of domain walls as they studied only the @xmath3 domain walls .",
    "ab initio calculations of @xcite show that oxygen vacancies have a tendency to move to domain walls and pin them .",
    "they also observed that defective domain walls are ti - centered . in their calculations , they had to assume a periodic array of domain walls with a high density of charge - neutral oxygen vacancies",
    ". there have also been other ab initio calculations of point defects in pbtio@xmath1 in the bulk @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the effect of oxygen vacancies on the structure of domain walls in tetragonal batio@xmath1 using a continuum theory that takes into account the fact that ferroelectrics are wide - band - gap semiconductors . in their numerical calculations they observed that @xmath0 and @xmath3 domain walls behave differently in response to oxygen vacancies .",

    "therefore , similar to the ab initio calculations of @xcite , we assume that oxygen vacancies interact with a domain wall and have a planar structure coinciding with the domain wall .    eq.([equilibrium - unit - cell ] ) is the governing equation for a defective domain wall as long as the oxygen vacancies are arranged periodically on the domain wall .",
    "however , @xmath49 and @xmath51 would change , in general .",
    "we can simplify the solution of the discrete boundary - value problem even further by noting that the displacements of cores and shells on the left side of the wall are related to those on the right side of the wall , i.e. , the wall is a reflection symmetry plane .",

    "note also that assuming that the domain wall is a mirror plane for displacements removes the translation invariance of the governing equations , i.e. , those cores and shells that lie one the domain wall in the reference configuration remain on the domain wall after relaxation ( i.e. @xmath57 ) .    when there are oxygen vacancies on the domain wall , one needs to look at boundary equations carefully .",
    "when modeling pbtio@xmath1 by a shell potential , an oxygen vacancy means removal of the core and shell of the oxygen atom and because we assume a charge neutral oxygen vacancy , there will be a charge redistribution .",
    "this will affect the shell charges of the neighboring shells .",
    "it is known that charge redistribution is highly localized .",
    "thus , in our calculations we distribute the charge @xmath61 , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are oxygen shell and core charges , only to the ( fourteen ) first nearest neighbors of each oxygen vacancy .",
    "most of the existing shell potentials have fixed charges . however , in a more realistic model shell charges should be variable to be able to adjust themselves to the environment , e.g. , in the presence of a vacancy .",
    "there have been several efforts in the literature on building empirical charge - variable models for different systems based on rappe and goddard s charge equilibrium method @xcite and its extensions . here , we use a fixed - charge shell potential for pbtio@xmath1 and are not aware of any charge - variable shell model for this material .",
    "therefore , we have to model the charge transfer due to oxygen vacancies approximately .",
    "however , this should not have severe effects on the results as our numerical tests show .",
    "we studied the sensitivity of solutions to the exact way of charge redistribution ; we compared two cases : in the first case we distributed the charge equally to the nearest neighbors and in the second case we distributed the charge to nearest neighbors depending on their distances from the vacancy and assuming that charge distribution is exponentially decaying .",
    "we did not see much difference and thus in this work we distribute the charge equally between the nearest neighbors .",
    "we consider three types of defective domain walls :",
    "( i ) o2-defective , ( ii ) o1-defective , and ( iii ) o3-defective .",
    "an o2-defective domain wall is pb - centered .",
    "[ reference ] for this notation .",
    "we see that the anharmonic lattice statics iterations do not converge in this case , i.e. , this is not a stable configuration .",
    "this is in agreement with ab initio calculations @xcite that predict ti - centered defective domain walls . o1 and o3-defective domain walls are ti - centered with no o1 and o3 cores and shells , respectively , on the domain wall in the reference configuration ( see fig .",
    "[ wall ] ) .",
    "the linearized governing equations can be solved exactly using the method proposed in @xcite .",
    "thus , we are able to solve the linearized governing equations exactly . now to obtain the fully nonlinear solutions we use a modified newton - raphson iteration . solving the linearized problem",
    ", we modify the reference configuration by imposing the harmonic displacements and then calculate the new unbalanced forces exactly using the interatomic potential @xcite . continuing in this manner ,",
    "if there is an equilibrium configuration close to the chosen reference configuration , unbalanced forces converge to zero . in the present work",
    ", convergence means that all forces have magnitudes less than @xmath64 .",
    "now , let us briefly explain the modified newton - raphson method , called the quasi - newton method , that we use throughout this work .",
    "newton method is based on the following quadratic approximation near the current configuration @xmath65 : @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 is the hessian matrix . by differentiating the above formula with respect to @xmath69",
    ", we obtain the newton method for determining the next configuration @xmath70 : @xmath71 note that in order to converge to a local minimum , the hessian must be positive definite .",
    "if the calculation of the hessian in each iteration becomes numerically inefficient ( like the present problem ) , one can use the quasi - newton method .",
    "the main idea behind this method is to start from a positive - definite approximation to the inverse hessian and to modify this approximation in each iteration using the gradient vector of that step .",
    "close to the local minimum , the approximate inverse hessian approaches the true inverse hessian and we would have the quadratic convergence of the newton method @xcite .",
    "here we use the broyden - fletcher - goldfarb - shanno ( bfgs ) algorithm @xcite for generating the approximate inverse hessian : @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 calculating @xmath76 , one then should use @xmath76 instead of @xmath77 to update the current configuration for the next configuration @xmath70 .",

    "<S> in this paper we study the effect of normal and shear strains and oxygen vacancies on the structure of @xmath0 ferroelectric domain walls in pbtio@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that oxygen vacancies move to the domain walls and pin them . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we assume a periodic arrangement of oxygen vacancies on both pb - centered and ti - centered domain walls in pbtio@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we use a semi - analytic anharmonic lattice statics method for obtaining the relaxed configurations using a shell potential . in agreement with recent ab initio calculations </S>",
    "<S> , we observe that a pb - centered domain wall with oxygen vacancies is not stable even under strain . </S>",
    "<S> our semi - analytic calculations for pbtio@xmath1 show that oxygen vacancies affect the structure of @xmath0 domain walls significantly but do not have a considerable effect on the thickness of domain walls ; they broaden the domain walls by about fifty percent . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the effect of normal and shear strains on both perfect and defective @xmath0 domain walls . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that normal and shear strains affect the structure but do not change the domain wall thickness .    </S>",
