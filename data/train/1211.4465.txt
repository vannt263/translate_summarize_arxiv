    "the concept of ergodicity is at the core of classical statistical mechanics : it establishes a connection between long - time averages of observables and statistical ensemble averages @xcite .",
    "the extension of the ergodic theorem to quantum mechanics was pioneered by von neumann  @xcite in a seminal paper on the unitary dynamics of closed quantum systems .",
    "the experimental possibility of studying the nonequilibrium dynamics of `` virtually '' isolated quantum systems  most notably cold atomic species in optical lattices  @xcite  has stimulated new interest in this issue .",
    "the simplest setting for such a nonequilibrium situation is that of a sudden quench of the hamiltonian , @xmath1 , governing the dynamics of the isolated quantum system : the after - quench ( @xmath2 ) unitary evolution is simply @xmath3 but the initial state @xmath4  for instance , the ground state of @xmath5  is generally a complicated superposition of the eigenstates of @xmath6 .",
    "since the energy is conserved , @xmath7 , it is reasonable to expect that a `` generic '' ergodic evolution in the hilbert space will lead to time averages which are reproduced by the microcanonical ensemble : this is what von neumann discussed for `` macroscopic '' observables @xcite , and is generally expected to occur  @xcite , independently of the initial state @xmath4 .",
    "classical physics teaches us also when to expect violations of ergodicity : on one extreme , for systems that are integrable @xcite or close enough to being integrable @xcite ; on the other , for systems with a glassy dynamics , be it due to interactions providing dynamical constraints @xcite , or to genuine disorder @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanically , dangers to ergodicity come from very similar sources : integrability , interactions , and disorder .",
    "integrability implies the existence of many constants of motion @xmath8 , and this clearly restricts the ergodic exploration of the microcanonical energy shell , leading to what one might call a `` breakdown of thermalization '' @xcite .",
    "it often results in a kind of `` generalized thermalization '' described by a statistical ensemble which maximizes entropy in the presence of the constraints @xmath9 , an ensemble introduced long ago by jaynes @xcite and known as generalized gibbs ensemble ( gge )  @xcite @xmath10 } \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 are lagrange multipliers which constrain the mean value of each @xmath12 to its @xmath13 value : @xmath14 $ ] .    on the theory side ,",
    "the approach to equilibrium has been carefully investigated for one - dimensional bose - hubbard models describing quench experiments in optical lattices and superlattices  @xcite .",
    "starting from nonhomogeneous initial states ( density waves ) , such as @xmath15 , and evolving the system with a bose - hubbard @xmath16 both at the integrable points @xmath17 ( free bosons ) and @xmath18 ( free hard - core bosons / spinless fermions ) , where analytic solutions are possible @xcite , and at general ( nonintegrable ) values of @xmath19 ( through time - dependent density - matrix renormalization group  @xcite ) , the physical picture emerging has led to the so - called _ local relaxation conjecture_@xcite : although the system is , _ sensu stricto _",
    ", in a pure state @xmath20 , when measured upon locally in a finite region @xmath21 , the resulting ( mixed ) reduced density matrix @xmath22 relaxes towards a stationary gibbs state of maximum entropy compatible with all the constants of motion .",
    "this relaxation is strongly tight to the `` locality '' of the observable @xmath23 one measures , and results from `` information transfer '' carried by the excitations along the system @xcite , which eventually `` thermalizes '' any finite region @xmath21 , the rest of the system acting as an effective bath for @xmath21 .",
    "remarkably , such an approach to equilibrium does not require time averages  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , a fast dynamical relaxation was recently observed  @xcite in a system of cold atoms , where the long - time stationary state was compatible with gge .",
    "a far more dangerous type of `` ergodicity crisis '' derives , apparently , from dynamical constraints imposed by interactions@xcite : when quenching a bose - hubbard model starting , for instance , from @xmath24  i.e , with an average density of bosons per site @xmath25 where , in equilibrium , a mott phase transition occurs for @xmath26  the ensuing dynamics leads to a fast relaxation / thermalization for quenches at small @xmath19 , while the relaxation is extremely slow ( and the more so , the more the size of the system increases ) and the dynamics appears effectively _ freezed _ for @xmath27 @xcite . concerning ergodicity breaking due to genuine disorder , both anderson localization , at the single - particle level  @xcite , and many - body localization , in the presence of interactions  @xcite ,",
    "are well - known examples of disorder - induced phenomena occurring in equilibrium physics .",
    "quantum quenches in the presence of disorder and interactions have also been studied , in the framework of many - body localization @xcite , but the physical picture is far from being fully understood .",
    "while breaking of translational invariance and disorder in the initial state @xmath4 have apparently little or no effect on the ensuing relaxation towards a stationary state if the after - quench hamiltonian @xmath6 is translationally invariant  @xcite , disorder in the final hamiltonian @xmath6 seems to play a quite crucial role : this has been seen in numerical studies of nonintegrable fermion models with disordered long - range hopping and nearest - neighbor interaction  @xcite , and has been recently corroborated through analytical arguments on integrable quantum spin chains of the ising/@xmath0 class  @xcite .",
    "our present study extends that of ref .  , where it was shown that , in the presence of disorder in @xmath6 , the long - time after - quench dynamics _ does not relax _ towards a stationary state , and time fluctuations generally persist in the expectation values of local operators , even in the thermodynamic limit",
    "; this is , essentially , due to the presence of a _ pure - point spectrum _ of @xmath6 associated to localized wave functions , as opposed to the smooth continuum of a system with extended states .",
    "one can view this persistence of time fluctuations in local measurements as a result of the inability of the system to carry information around @xcite , due to localization .",
    "time averages are , therefore , mandatory in comparing dynamical quantities to statistical ensemble averages . but here a further surprise emerges , which will be the main focus of this study : while time averages of one - body local observables are perfectly well reproduced by the relevant statistical ensemble  the gge , being the considered models , essentially , free - fermion ones  time averages of many - body local operators show clear deviations from the corresponding gge prediction , in agreement with recent numerical findings  @xcite .",
    "we will exemplify these ideas on a model of disordered one - dimensional fermions with long - range hoppings , showing a transition between extended and localized eigenstates , and on disordered ising/@xmath0 models .",
    "we will start , sec .",

    "[ sec : models ] , we describe the models we have investigated . in sec .",
    "[ sec : gge - one - body ] we will analyze the essential reason why gge works perfectly well in predicting infinite - time averages of _ one - body operators _ , even for finite systems ( as long as one integrates over revivals ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : gge - many - body ] we will discuss why this is not generally the case for many - body operators , unless time fluctuations of one - body green s functions vanish for large @xmath28 .",
    "next , in secs .",
    "[ sec : spinless ] and [ sec : ising ] we will present our results for the two models we have considered . section  [ discussion : sec ] contains a final discussion , and our conclusions and perspectives .",
    "let us start by defining the problem .",
    "consider a standard quantum quench : an initial state @xmath4 , ground state of some hamiltonian @xmath5 , evolves under a different time - independent hamiltonian @xmath6 .",
    "given an observable @xmath29 , its quantum average can be separated in two terms ( we take @xmath30 ) : @xmath31 where the time - independent part @xmath32 results from an infinite - time average of @xmath33 @xmath34 while @xmath35 represents a fluctuating part ( with a vanishing time average ) .",
    "an alternative standard decomposition of @xmath33 proceeds by introducing the ( many - body ) eigenstates @xmath36 of @xmath6 , with energy @xmath37 , and inserting resolutions of the identity in eq .  .",
    "defining @xmath38 and @xmath39 , one gets @xmath40 where the first term , @xmath41 , is the so - called diagonal average @xcite , while the second , time - dependent , part has been recast as a fourier transform of a weighted joint ( many - body ) density of states @xmath42 . with the quite usual assumption of no energy degeneracy , @xmath43 if @xmath44 , one can quickly prove that the diagonal average indeed coincides with the long - time average @xcite : @xmath45 while time fluctuations are given by the fourier transform of @xmath46 : @xmath47 as discussed in ref .",
    ", the behavior of the fluctuating part @xmath35 , relaxing and decaying to 0 or remaining finite ( with persistent oscillations ) for @xmath48 , is strongly tied to the `` smoothness '' of @xmath46 in the thermodynamic limit ( for finite systems , @xmath46 is always a series of discrete dirac @xmath49 s , hence @xmath35 will never go to zero for @xmath48 , and revivals will appear ) . indeed , @xmath35 will decay to zero for large @xmath28 if @xmath46 is smooth enough , due to the destructive interference induced in the @xmath50 integral by the strongly oscillating phase @xmath51 ( riemann - lebesgue lemma ) ; on the contrary , disorder and an important _ pure - point spectrum _ part , i.e. , @xmath49 functions associated to localized eigenstates which do not merge smoothly into a continuum , will lead to persistent time fluctuations @xmath35 for local operators @xcite .    in the rest of the paper we will concentrate on two `` solvable '' models with disorder which will be presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] : disordered one - dimensional fermions with long - range hoppings ( which can show either power - law localized states or extended ones , depending on a parameter controlling the long - range hopping variance ) , and disordered ising/@xmath0 model .",
    "both , being quadratic fermionic models , can be quite effectively numerically diagonalized , i.e. , one can find the one - body spectrum @xmath52 and the corresponding quasiparticle creation operator @xmath53 to express @xmath54 .",
    "this , in turn , allows us to calculate the fermionic local one - body green s functions : @xmath55 where @xmath56 creates a fermion at site @xmath57 .",
    "we will show that , in view of wick s theorem , a key issue in understanding the validity of gge for general many - body observables in such free - fermion - like hamiltonians has to do with the nature of the long - time fluctuations of the one - body green s functions .",
    "that might seem a simple matter to explore , but unfortunately , in the general disordered case , the one - body green s functions are essentially impossible to obtain analytically , and their numerical study is often elusive : you can only study a finite system - size @xmath58 for a finite time @xmath28 , and whether the fluctuations will eventually vanish or not for @xmath59 ( first ) and @xmath48 ( after , otherwise you always get revivals ) is often hard to tell .",
    "it turns out that a useful tool to distinguish the presence or absence of time fluctuations for large @xmath28 is given by the time - averaged fluctuations : @xmath60 which is zero when the fluctuations vanish for large @xmath28 , and is finite otherwise .",
    "we will show how to make progress analytically , for this quantity , to pin point the behavior of the large-@xmath28 fluctuations of one - body green s functions .",
    "this analytical progress will require an assumption of _ absence of gap degeneracies _",
    ", i.e. , @xmath61 only when @xmath62 and @xmath63 or @xmath64 and @xmath65 , restricted , however , to the _ one - body spectrum _ , an assumption that can be argued to be a reasonable one , especially in the presence of disorder .",
    "its general validity for many - body energy eigenvalues , on the contrary , is rather tricky ( see discussion in sec .",
    "[ discussion : sec ] ) .    in order to get smoother results we will perform averages of @xmath66 over different realizations of disorder .",
    "we stress , however , that the disorder average will always be performed _",
    "after _ the computation of @xmath66 for each realization : performing the disorder average before taking the squared time integral , i.e. , on @xmath35 , would effectively kill the time fluctuations @xmath35 , by a kind of `` self - averaging '' @xcite .",
    "in this work we concentrate on two `` solvable '' models possessing a simple fermionic description .",
    "the first model describes spinless fermions hopping on a chain  @xcite : @xmath67 where @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) creates ( destroys ) a fermion at site @xmath57 and @xmath70 is a ( real ) hopping integral between sites @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "we will in general take the @xmath73 s to be random and long ranged , with a gaussian distribution of zero mean , @xmath74 , and variance given by : @xmath75 here @xmath76 is a real positive parameter setting how fast the hoppings variance decays with distance .",
    "the peculiarity of this long - range - hopping model is that , regardless of the value of @xmath77 ( which hereafter is fixed to @xmath78 ) , it has an anderson transition from ( metallic ) extended eigenstates , for @xmath79 , to ( insulating ) power - law localized eigenstates for @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "physically , this is due to the fact that , for small @xmath76 , long - range hoppings are capable of overcoming the localization due to disorder .",
    "the clean nearest - neighbor hopping model is recovered by taking @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the kronecker delta : we will always use this choice for the initial hamiltonian @xmath5 , with the corresponding ground state @xmath4 being the filled fermi sea .",
    "( the reason behind this simple choice for @xmath5 is that the long - time fluctuation properties do not depend , qualitatively , on the initial hamiltonian being ordered or not , see ref .  ) .",
    "being quadratic in the fermion operators , @xmath83 can be diagonalized for any chain of size @xmath58 in terms of new fermionic operators @xmath84 where @xmath85 are the wave functions of the eigenmodes of energy @xmath52 : @xmath86 .",
    "the energies @xmath52 and the associated wave functions @xmath85 are obtained , for any given realization of the hoppings @xmath70 in a chain of size @xmath58 with open boundary conditions , by numerically diagonalizing the @xmath87 one - body hopping matrix .",
    "the second hamiltonian we considered describes a disordered ising/@xmath0 chain in a transverse field @xcite : @xmath88 where @xmath58 is the size of the chain , @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) are spin-@xmath91 pauli matrices for the @xmath57 site , and periodic boundary conditions are assumed , @xmath92 .",
    "@xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 are real and describe , respectively , the nearest - neighbor spin couplings and the transverse magnetic field . a quadratic fermionic hamiltonian is obtained here by applying a jordan - wigner transformation @xcite @xmath96 , where @xmath97 : @xmath98 where @xmath99 , and the anisotropy parameter @xmath100 is such that @xmath101 and @xmath102 . in the relevant sub - sector with an even number of fermions",

    "we therefore define new fermions @xcite @xmath106 which diagonalize the hamiltonian @xmath107 .",
    "the ( positive ) eigenvalues @xmath108 and the associated eigenfunctions @xmath109 are obtained , once again , by diagonalizing a @xmath110 one - body matrix  @xcite .",
    "notice also the strict particle - hole symmetry present even in the general disordered case  @xcite : for every positive eigenvalue @xmath111 , with associated @xmath109 , there is a negative eigenvalue @xmath112 associated to @xmath113 .",
    "when considering quenches for this hamiltonian , we always start from a clean @xmath5 , with @xmath114 , @xmath115 ( ising case ) , and @xmath116 , while , for the final disordered hamiltonian , we take @xmath117 , @xmath115 , and @xmath118 , where @xmath119 sets the disorder strength and @xmath120 , @xmath121 are uncorrelated uniform random numbers in @xmath122 . the aim of our analysis is to study the behavior of different disorder realizations for very large @xmath58 ( ideally , in the thermodynamic limit ) . practically , the largest size we will consider is @xmath123 . given a disorder realization for @xmath123 , we will generate corresponding realizations at smaller @xmath58 by cutting away the same amount of sites from the two edges . in this way",
    ", we obtain a smoother behavior for all quantities versus @xmath58 . for every quantity @xmath124",
    "considered , we have checked its probability distribution @xmath125 for different realizations of disorder .",
    "sometimes @xmath125 deviates strongly from a gaussian distribution , and is nearly ( although not precisely ) lognormal , i.e. , it is @xmath126 which is approximately gaussian distributed . in such a situation , we will calculate and plot the median ( i.e. , the geometric mean ) @xmath127_{\\mathrm{av}}^\\mathrm{g } = \\exp ( \\left [ \\log x \\right]_{\\mathrm{av } } ) $ ] and the geometric standard deviation @xmath128 ) $ ] , rather than the usual ( arithmetic ) mean @xmath127_{\\mathrm{av}}$ ] , and its standard deviation @xmath129 $ ] ( in the plots , the error bars will then go from @xmath127_{\\mathrm{av}}^\\mathrm{g } \\exp ( -\\sigma[\\log x ] ) $ ] to @xmath127_{\\mathrm{av}}^\\mathrm{g } \\exp ( \\sigma[\\log x ] ) $ ] ) .",
    "for both the models considered above , after diagonalization , the hamiltonian is expressed as : @xmath130 where @xmath52 is the positive excitation energy of the state @xmath131 and @xmath132 is the energy of the state @xmath133 annihilated by all the @xmath134 .",
    "notice that , in diagonalizing @xmath83 , eq .",
    ", one generally obtains some negative @xmath52 : in such a case , it is enough to perform a particle - hole transformation @xmath135 to change the sign of @xmath52 .",
    "physically , that implies that all negative energies are occupied in the ground state @xmath133 , and the resulting excitations describe particles or holes .    in the following two sections we will use expression for @xmath6 : all the observations made",
    "are valid for both the models we have just described .",
    "notice that the number operators @xmath136 commute with @xmath6 in eq .   and are therefore obvious constants of motion in the gge averages , @xmath137 .",
    "in this section we are going to show that , for a free fermion hamiltonian of the form given in eq .  , the long - time average ( and the diagonal average ) of any one - body operator coincides with the corresponding gge average , for any system size @xmath58 , and any possible quench : @xmath138 with some important remarks to be made when there are degeneracies in the one - body spectrum ( see below ) .",
    "as we shall see , this can be traced back to the constraints that the gge sets through the constants of motion @xmath12 .",
    "we stress that , remarkably , this equality holds even for a finite - size chain @xmath58 , while , usually , statistical ensembles need a thermodynamic limit .",
    "examples of one - body operators are , in real space , @xmath139 or @xmath140 , the local density @xmath141 , the density @xmath142 , and , in momentum space , @xmath143 ( where @xmath144 ) , etc .",
    "more generally , a one - body fermionic operator can always be written , neglecting irrelevant constants and rewriting the @xmath145 s in terms of the @xmath146 ( inverting eqs .   or ) , as : @xmath147 where @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 are @xmath87 matrices .",
    "let us start showing that @xmath151 . if @xmath152 denotes a general many - body eigenstate of @xmath6 , then clearly only the diagonal elements of @xmath148 enter in the diagonal matrix element : @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the occupation number of eigenmode @xmath155 in the eigenstate @xmath156 . in terms of @xmath157 , the diagonal average of @xmath158",
    "is readily expressed as : @xmath159 where we have added and extra sum over @xmath160 , using @xmath161 , and then recognized two resolutions of the identity @xmath162 .",
    "notice , therefore , that the initial state enters only through @xmath163 , i.e. , exactly the constants of motion which are constrained and reproduced by the gge averages : @xmath164 .",
    "the conclusion is therefore simple , as the gge average of @xmath158 is : @xmath165 where we used that , by construction of the gge , @xmath166 .    concerning the equality @xmath167",
    ", we should pay attention to the cases in which @xmath6 has degenerate single - particle eigenvalues , @xmath168 ( for instance , when @xmath6 is disorder - free ) . in these cases",
    ", the time average of @xmath169 suppresses all the oscillatory factors @xmath170 occurring in the @xmath149 and @xmath150 terms of eq .  , but all the factors @xmath171 corresponding to degenerate eigenvalues appearing in the @xmath148 terms survive .",
    "therefore : @xmath172 where we have singled out the diagonal elements , and the second sum runs over all the degenerate pairs @xmath173 such that @xmath174 .",
    "because of degeneracies , however , there is more freedom in the choice of the fermionic operators @xmath175 : we can always perform a unitary rotation in each degenerate subspace in such a way that @xmath176 for @xmath177 .",
    "with such a choice of the @xmath175 s , the extra terms in eq .   vanish , and we recover the initial statement in eq .  , i.e. , for any size and any quench , the long - time average of any one - body operator is equal to the gge one .",
    "we stress the fact that , for any finite system , @xmath178 will have recurrent fluctuations @xmath179 , the so - called _ returns _ or _ revivals _ , due to the discreteness of the finite - size spectrum : nevertheless , integrating over all times ( across revivals ) is guaranteed to reproduce the gge average : @xmath180 this statement , however , does not imply that the fluctuating part @xmath179 decreases to @xmath181 for @xmath48 , as indeed evident from the presence of finite - size revivals .",
    "as we shall see , @xmath179 might indeed persist for all times even in the thermodynamic limit , when @xmath6 is disordered : this in turn implies that @xmath182 might not exist in some cases , preventing a straightforward application of wick s theorem to extend the equalities of averages in eq .   to many - body operators",
    "in the previous section we have shown that the gge average of a one - body operator coincides exactly with its long - time average . here",
    "we will see that , for a general many - body observable @xmath23 , the situation is more complicated , and gge can be proven to correctly predict long - time averages under two additional requirements : ( 1 ) @xmath23 is a finite sum of powers of some fermionic operators , and ( 2 ) the time fluctuations of the one - body green s functions associated to such fermionic operators are vanishing .",
    "whenever either of the two conditions is not realized , @xmath183 is not guaranteed to coincide with @xmath32 : we will indeed discuss cases of a definite disagreement between the two averages because of a violation of condition ( 2 ) above , i.e. , the persistence of time fluctuations of one - body green s functions .",
    "the key to the story is wick s theorem @xcite , which clearly applies to the free - fermion hamiltonians we are discussing @xcite .",
    "any many - body observable @xmath23 can be expressed as a linear combination of powers of the original real - space fermions @xmath145 and @xmath184 .",
    "since @xmath185 is a bcs - slater determinant , we can expand @xmath186 , using wick s theorem , as a sum of products of one - body green s functions @xmath187 and @xmath188 . to make things more clear ,",
    "let us consider , for instance , the density - density correlations @xmath189 with @xmath190 , a two - body operator whose wick s expansion reads : @xmath191 this expansion clearly involves a finite number of terms ( condition ( 1 ) ) .",
    "now suppose ( condition ( 2 ) ) that the time fluctuations of the green s functions vanish for large @xmath28 , hence the limits @xmath192 and @xmath193 exist . from the analysis of the previous section , it is obvious that such limits must coincide with the corresponding gge averages : @xmath194 , and @xmath195 .",
    "it follows therefore that @xmath196 exists ( i.e. , its fluctuating part @xmath197 vanishes for large @xmath28 ) and is given by : @xmath198 where the final step uses the fact that wick s theorem also applies to gge averages of free - fermion hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "notice that , since long - time fluctuations of @xmath199 vanish , the infinite - time limit dominates the time average , and this implies : @xmath200 for a similar discussion when @xmath6 is a translationally invariant disorder - free ising-@xmath201 chain , see ref .  .",
    "a similar proof works quite generally for all observables @xmath23 provided the two stipulated conditions are satisfied .",
    "a few important remarks are in order : ( _ i _ ) the existence of _ time limits _ of green s functions , as opposed to time averages , are crucial in applying wick s theorem , because it is generally false that the `` time average of a sum of products '' coincides with the `` sum of products of time averages '' ; ( _ ii _ ) for definiteness , we have chosen , above , the real - space fermions @xmath184 to expand @xmath23 , but similar arguments can be made in any one - body fermionic basis @xmath202 , for instance , a momentum space basis . notice , in this respect , that @xmath23 might involve an infinite expansion in terms of the @xmath184 s and a finite one in terms of the @xmath203 s ( condition ( 1 ) ) . in this case , if the time fluctuations of @xmath204 and @xmath205 vanish ( condition ( 2 ) ) one can still conclude that @xmath206 ; ( _ iii _ ) whenever the time fluctuations of the one - body green s functions do not vanish for large @xmath28 , and/or the expansion of the operator @xmath23 involves an infinite number of wick s contractions there is no guarantee that gge will not reproduce long - time averages : we simply can not prove it by using wick s theorem .",
    "nevertheless , we will later discuss ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : many - body - hop ] ) explicit cases where the persistence of one - body time fluctuations , due to disorder and to the presence of localized eigenstates , indeed leads to a definite discrepancy between @xmath32 and @xmath183 .",

    "we will consider observables @xmath23 in real space and in momentum space , and hence we will need to ascertain the time dependence of both real - space and momentum - space green s functions . to unify the treatment of both cases , we will consider a general fermionic operator @xmath207 obtained by applying a unitary transformation @xmath208 ( of matrix elements @xmath209 , with @xmath210 the identity ) to the @xmath211 s which diagonalize @xmath83 : for the original real - space fermions @xmath145 , @xmath85 is the real - space wave function of the @xmath155 eigenstate , while for the momentum space fermions @xmath212 , @xmath213 . as discussed in secs .",
    "[ sec : gge - one - body ] and [ sec : gge - many - body ] , if the green s functions associated to the @xmath214 s have vanishing long - time fluctuations , then also the long - time fluctuations of @xmath23 disappear and @xmath215 .",

    "the assumption of the absence of gap degeneracies is often used in the literature , and dates back to the original paper of von neumann @xcite , who , however , carefully stipulates it to hold only within each microcanonical energy shell , and not for the many - body spectrum at large . )",
    "the condition of absence of gap degeneracies @xcite is clearly untenable for models with noninteracting quasiparticles : you can produce an exponentially large number of many - body states @xmath388 and @xmath389 whose spectral gap @xmath390 coincides exactly with @xmath391 : simply operate on @xmath36 and @xmath392 by applying , in identical fashion , an arbitrary number of particles and/or holes , @xmath393 , and @xmath394",
    ". then @xmath395 because quasiparticles do not interact , and therefore @xmath396 .",
    "one might argue that this proliferation of exactly degenerate gaps is a peculiarity of models with noninteracting quasiparticles @xcite : interaction effects might change the picture completely .",
    "this is definitely an interesting point , which deserves further studies , but certainly also a very hard one , because the combination of disorder and interactions makes the analysis highly nontrivial .",
    "nevertheless , let us mention the following simple argument .",
    "suppose that quasiparticles interact , but there is still an exponentially large ( in the number of particles @xmath397 ) number of states with very small spectral gap differences @xmath398 : @xmath399 .",
    "then , all these spectral gap quasi - degeneracies will appear , effectively , as true degeneracies until a time @xmath400 is reached , and that time might indeed be very large .    in conclusion",
    ", we have analyzed after - quench relaxation and thermalization issues for `` solvable '' models with disordered fermions ( or spins ) in one dimension .",
    "several points are still open and deserve further studies .",
    "let us just mention two of them : what is the role of a mobility edge , separating localized from extended states , in the after - quench relaxation ?",
    "what is the role of interactions in combination with disorder in the out - of - equilibrium dynamics of closed quantum systems ?",
    "a special thanks goes to alessandro silva , our former collaborator in a recent publication on the same subject , for many discussions and a careful reading of the manuscript .",
    "we also thank f. becca , m. fabrizio , j. marino , p. smacchia , g. menegoz , and a. russomanno for discussions ."
