    "since the discovery of planetary transits in the light curve of hd  209458 @xcite , this star has been the subject of intensive study : multicolor observations @xcite have confirmed the expected color - dependence of the light curve due to the stellar limb - darkening .",
    "radial - velocity monitoring during transit @xcite has yielded variations in excess of the orbital motion , due to the occultation of the rotating stellar limb by the planet .",
    "very - high - precision photometry ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter b01 ) permitted an improved estimate of the planetary and stellar radii , orbital inclination , and stellar limb - darkening , as well as a search for planetary satellites and circumplanetary rings .",
    "transiting extrasolar planets present a unique opportunity for us to learn about the atmospheres of the objects .",
    "wavelength - dependent variations in the height at which the planet becomes opaque to tangential rays will result in wavelength - dependent changes in the ratio of spectra taken in and out of transit .",
    "several groups @xcite have pursued theoretical explorations of this effect for a variety of model planetary atmospheres .",
    "these studies have demonstrated that clouds , varying temperature structure and chemical composition , and even atmospheric winds , all produce variations that would be observed , should the requisite precision be achieved .",
    "based on these calculations , the expected variations could be as large as 0.1% relative to the stellar continuum .",
    "a previous search by @xcite for variations between spectra of hd  209458 observed in and out of transit ( using extant spectra gathered for radial velocity measurements ) was sensitive to features with a relative intensity greater than 12% of the stellar continuum .",
    "@xcite conducted a similar study , and achieved a detection threshold of 1% . although the precision achieved by both these studies was insufficient to address any reasonable model of the planetary atmosphere , @xcite placed limits on the models of the planetary exosphere .",
    "searches for absorption due to a planetary exosphere have also been conducted for 51  peg during the times of inferior conjunction @xcite .",
    "we obtained 684 spectra of hd  209458 with the _ hst _ stis spectrograph , spanning the times of four planetary transits , on ut 2000 april 25 , april 2829 , may 56 , and may 1213 .",
    "the primary science goal of this project was to improve the estimate of the planetary and stellar radii , orbital inclination , and stellar limb - darkening , as well as conduct a search for planetary satellites and circumplanetary rings ; we presented these results in b01 . in selecting the wavelength range for these observations ,",
    "the desire to maximize the number of detected photons led us to consider regions near 600  nm , where the combination of the instrumental sensitivity and the stellar flux would be optimized .    the secondary science goal was to pursue the prediction by @xcite ( and , later , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of a strong spectroscopic feature at 589.3  nm due to absorption from sodium in the planetary atmosphere .",
    "thus we chose to observe the wavelength region @xmath1  nm , with a medium resolution of @xmath2 , corresponding to a resolution element of 0.11  nm .",
    "the details of the data acquisition and analysis are presented in b01 , and we refer the reader to that publication . in summary ,",
    "the data reduction consisted of ( 1 ) recalibrating the two - dimensional ccd images , ( 2 ) removing cosmic - ray events , ( 3 ) extracting one - dimensional spectra , ( 4 ) summing the detected counts over wavelength to yield a photometric index , and ( 5 ) correcting the resulting photometric time series for variations that depend on the phase of the _ hst _ orbit and for variations between visits . the only difference in these procedures between b01 and the current work is in step ( 4 ) : previously , we summed the spectra either ( a ) over the entire available wavelength range , or ( b ) over the blue and red halves of the available range . in the present paper , we restrict greatly the wavelength span over which we perform the integration .    as described in b01 , observations of the first transit ( ut 2000 april 25 ) were partially compromised by a database error in the location of the position of the spectrum on the detector .",
    "the result was that the spectrum was not entirely contained within the ccd subarray . in the subsequent data analysis",
    ", we ignored these data . furthermore , as described in b01 , the first orbit ( of 5 ) for each visit shows photometric variability in excess of that achieved for the remaining orbits .",
    "these variations are presumably due to the spacecraft ; we omit these data as well .",
    "this leaves 417 spectra of the 684 acquired .    since we do not know the precise width of the feature we seek , we select three bands of varying width , each centered on the sodium feature . we refer to these bands as `` narrow '' ( @xmath3 ) , `` medium '' ( @xmath4 ) , and `` wide '' ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the @xmath3 band is the smallest wavelength range that still encompasses the stellar sodium lines ; the @xmath5 band is the widest wavelength range that permits an adjacent calibrating band to the blue .",
    "the @xmath4 band is roughly intermediate ( by ratio ) between these two extremes ; it is @xmath6 the range of the @xmath5 band , and @xmath7 times the range of the @xmath3 band .",
    "we further define , for each of these , a `` blue '' ( @xmath8 ) and a `` red '' ( @xmath9 ) band , which bracket the `` center '' ( @xmath10 ) band .",
    "the names and ranges of these nine bands are given in table  1 , and displayed in figure  1 .",
    "for each of these 9 bands , we produce a photometric time series by the procedure described above . the photometric index at a time @xmath11 is then identified by a letter indicating the width , and a subscript indicating the position ( e.g. `` @xmath12 '' indicates the photometric index in the wide band , red side , at time @xmath11 ) .",
    "each of these is a normalized time series , with a value of unity when averaged over the out - of - transit observations ; the minimum values near the transit centers are approximately 0.984 .",
    "we denote the time of the center of the photometric transit by @xmath13 . in what follows ,",
    "we consider the in - transit observations , ( i.e. those that occur between second and third contacts , @xmath14  min ) , which we denote by @xmath15 , and the out - of - transit observations ( those that occur before first contact , or after fourth contact , @xmath16  min ) , which we denote by @xmath17 .",
    "there are 171 in - transit observations , and 207 out - of - transit observations .",
    "we ignore the small fraction ( 7% ) of observations that occur during ingress or egress .",
    "one potential source of color - dependent variation in the transit shape is stellar limb - darkening ( see figure  6 in b01 ; also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in order to investigate this possibility , we produce ( for each width ) the difference of the red and blue bands : @xmath18 the observed standard deviations in these time series ( measured over the out - of - transit observations ) are @xmath19 = 3.3 \\times 10^{-4}$ ] , @xmath20 = 3.6 \\times 10^{-4}$ ] , and @xmath21 = 5.4 \\times 10^{-4}$ ] .",
    "these values match the predictions based on photon noise .    in order to check for changes in the transit depth due to stellar limb - darkening ,",
    "we then calculate , for each of the time series above , the difference in the mean of the relative flux , between the in - transit observations and the out - of - transit observations : @xmath22 overbars indicate averages over time , and each quoted error is the estimated standard deviation of the mean .",
    "all of these values are consistent with no variation .",
    "thus , we have no evidence for color - dependent limb - darkening between these bands , which span about 15  nm .",
    "we compared these results to predictions based on a theoretical model of the stellar surface brightness .",
    "the model was produced by r.  kurucz ( personal communication , 2000 ) .",
    "we denote it by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the cosine of the angle between the line of sight and the normal to the local stellar surface .",
    "the stellar parameters were taken to be the best - fit values as found by @xcite : @xmath25  k , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 = 0.00 $ ] .",
    "the model is evaluated at a spectral resolution of @xmath28 ( greatly in excess of the stis resolution , @xmath29 ) , and at 17  values of @xmath30 $ ]    the stellar model allows us to produce a theoretical transit curve over a chosen bandpass , which includes the effects of stellar limb - darkening .",
    "we do not force the limb - darkening to fit a parameterized model .",
    "rather , we interpolate between the values of @xmath24 on which the model of @xmath23 is initially calculated . for each @xmath31",
    ", we produce the theoretical transit curve , @xmath32 , for all @xmath11 at which we have data .",
    "the curve is calculated by integrating over the unocculted portion of the stellar disk as described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we assume the best - fit values from b01 for the stellar radius ( @xmath33 ) , planetary radius ( @xmath34 , where @xmath35  km is the equatorial radius of jupiter at a pressure of 1  bar ; @xcite ) , orbital period ( @xmath36  days ) , orbital inclination ( @xmath37 ) and semi - major axis ( @xmath38  au ) , assuming a value for the stellar mass of @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "we note that the stis data have an effective continuum that is tilted relative to the theoretical values , due to the wavelength dependent sensitivity of the instrument .",
    "we wish to emulate the data , where each @xmath31 is weighted by the observed number of photons .",
    "to do so , we fit a low - order polynomial ( in @xmath31 ) to the model disk - integrated spectrum , and a second low - order polynomial to the stis data .",
    "we subsequently divide the calculated @xmath32 for each @xmath11 by the ratio of these polynomials .",
    "next , we integrate @xmath32 in @xmath31 over each of the band passes in table  1 .",
    "we subsequently difference the model light curve as calculated for the blue and red bands ( emulating what we did with the data in eq .  [ 1 ] ) , and then evaluate the mean of the difference ( as in eq .",
    "[ 2 ] ) : @xmath40 these results can be compared directly with equation  ( 2 ) .",
    "each of these is much smaller than the observational precision we achieved , and thus consistent with our observational result of no significant offset .",
    "furthermore , the results stated in equation  ( 2 ) demonstrate that the data remain photon - noise limited at these high levels of precision : we have taken the mean of two large groups of data ( roughly 200 observations apiece ) , and found that the difference is consistent with photon - noise limited photometry , with a typical precision @xmath41 .      in order to search for variations in the sodium band relative to the adjacent bands , we produce ( for each width ) the mean light curve of the blue and red bands , and difference this from the light curve for the center band : @xmath42 & / & 2\\phm{.}\\\\ m_{na}(t ) & = & m_c(t ) & - & [ m_b(t ) & + & m_r(t ) ] & / & 2\\phm{.}\\\\ w_{na}(t ) & = & w_c(t ) & - & [ w_b(t ) & + & w_r(t ) ] & / & 2 .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] this linear combination removes the variations due to the color dependence of the limb - darkening of the stellar continuum . as we found above (   2.1 )",
    ", this effect is very small ( eq .  [ 3 ] ) .",
    "we consider the effect of the deviations in the limb - darkening that occur in the cores of stellar absorption features in   4.1 , and show that this effect is also negligible .",
    "the three time series in equation  ( 4 ) are plotted as a function of absolute value of the time from the center of transit in figure  2 .",
    "the observed standard deviations in these time series over the out - of - transit observations are @xmath43 = 5.5 \\times 10^{-4}$ ] , @xmath44 = 3.7 \\times 10^{-4}$ ] , and @xmath45 = 3.5 \\times 10^{-4}$ ] .",
    "these achieved values match the predictions of the photon - noise - limited precision .    in order to look for changes in the transit depth in the sodium - band relative to the adjacent bands , we calculate , for each of the time series above , the difference in the mean as observed in and out of transit : @xmath46 as before , the errors shown are the 1-@xmath47 errors of the mean .",
    "the results indicate that we have detected a deeper transit in the sodium band for the narrow and medium bandwidths , with a significance of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "we find no significant offset for the wide bandwidth .",
    "furthermore , we calculate the three quantities in equation  ( 5 ) for each of the three transits separately .",
    "these results confirm the conclusion that there is a deeper signal in the narrow and medium bands .",
    "the variations between visits for the same band are not significant given the precision of the data .",
    "in figure  3 , we plot histograms of the in - transit data and the out - of - transit data , for the narrow band .",
    "this plot shows that each of these sets of points appears to be drawn from a normal distribution with a standard deviation as predicted by photon - counting arguments .",
    "however , the in - transit points scatter about a mean that is significantly offset from that defined by the out - of - transit points .",
    "this indicates that we have not skewed these distributions by our analysis procedures : rather , the in - transit observations appear to represent a shifted version of the out - of - transit observations .",
    "we bin @xmath50 in time , and plot these results in figure  4 .",
    "these further illustrate that we have observed a deeper transit in the sodium band .",
    "we investigate the possibility that the observed decrement is due to non - linearity in the stis ccd : since the observed value of @xmath51 is @xmath52 for a change in mean intensity inside to outside transit of @xmath53 , a non - linearity of @xmath54% across this range would be required . @xcite",
    "derive an upper limit that is an order of magnitude lower than this .",
    "we further test this effect directly by selecting 18  strong stellar absorption features in our observed wavelength range . for each spectral feature",
    ", we define a set of band passes with the same wavelength range as those listed in table  1 , but now centered on the spectral line .",
    "we derive @xmath55 and @xmath56 for each of these as in equation  ( 5 ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure  5 .",
    "we find no correlation of either @xmath55 or @xmath56 with spectral line depth .",
    "these tests also confirm our evaluation of the precision we achieve in equation  ( 5 ) : we find that the values of @xmath55 or @xmath56 are normally distributed , with a mean consistent with 0 , and a standard deviation as we found above ( eq .  [ 5 ] ) .",
    "as described above , the quantity that we observe is the difference in the transit depth in a band centered on the na  d lines to the average of two flanking bands , as a function of time from the center of transit : we denoted these by @xmath50 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , above .",
    "we wish to compare these results to models of the planetary atmosphere .",
    "several steps are required to transform the model predictions into the same quantity as the observable , and we describe these steps here .",
    "we first produce several model calculations of the change in the effective planetary radius as a function of wavelength , as prescribed by @xcite .",
    "for all the models , we use the best - fit values from b01 for @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 as given in   2.1 .",
    "we further specify the planetary mass ( @xmath64 ) and the stellar effective temperature ( @xmath65  k ) , both as given by @xcite .",
    "we set the equatorial rotational velocity of the planet to @xmath66 .",
    "this is the value implied by the measured planetary radius , under the assumption that the planet is tidally locked ( i.e. the rotational period is the same as the orbital period ) .",
    "each model includes the effect of photoionization as described in @xcite , which reduces the core strength of the na  d lines , but does not significantly change the wings .",
    "the fiducial model has a cloud deck with cloud tops at a pressure of .0368  bar , and solar metallicity ( the measured value for hd  209458 ; * ? ? ?",
    "we also consider a number of variants to the fiducial model , representing changes to either the metal abundance , or the cloud height .",
    "these variants are listed in table  2 . for each model",
    "( denoted by the index @xmath4 ) , we have the theoretical planetary radius @xmath67 , where @xmath31 denotes the wavelength . for each of these , we renormalize @xmath67 so that the average value of the planetary radius over the entire stis bandpass is the best - fit value determined by b01 ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "these renormalized functions @xmath67 are shown in figure  6 .",
    "we use the theoretical model of the stellar surface brightness [ @xmath23 ; described in   2.1 ] to include the effects of the wavelength - dependent limb - darkening of the star .",
    "this approach allows us to account for both the continuum limb - darkening , and the deviations that occur from this in the cores of absorption lines ; these can be significant in the case of the sodium features .",
    "in general , the limb - darkening is less pronounced in the cores of the sodium lines than in the adjacent continuum , and thus for a planetary radius that is independent of wavelength , the transit light curve near @xmath13 is deeper and more rounded as observed in the continuum than as observed in the core of an absorption line .",
    "we proceed as described in   2.1 , with the exception that @xmath67 is now a function of wavelength : for each @xmath31 , we produce the theoretical transit curve , @xmath69 .",
    "we bin these results in the wavelength bands as described in   2 , and difference the values in the band centered on the sodium lines from the average of the flanking bands , as prescribed by equation  ( 4 ) .",
    "the result is a theoretical time series that closely resembles the observed stis time series , with the effect of a wavelength - dependent planetary radius included . these model time series",
    "are shown in figure  7 , and may be compared directly with the data shown in figures  2 & 4 .",
    "we find that most of the models listed in table  1 produce differential transits that are significantly deeper than our observational result . only models n4 or c3 , which represent , respectively , extreme values of high cloud height or depleted atomic sodium abundance , produce transits of approximately the correct depth .",
    "we have detected a significantly deeper transit in the sodium band relative to the adjacent bands .",
    "we interpret the signal as due to absorption by sodium in the planetary atmosphere .",
    "we are encouraged in this interpretation by the following two considerations : first , a sodium feature in the transmission spectrum of hd  209458 was predicted unanimously by the current modeling efforts @xcite .",
    "second , observed spectra of l - type objects ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , t - dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and , in particular , the brown dwarf gl  229  b ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , show very strong absorption from alkali metal lines @xcite .",
    "these objects span a temperature range of 900 - 2000  k , which includes the equilibrium temperature of hd  209458  b , @xmath70  k ( where @xmath71 indicates the bond albedo ) .",
    "( it should be noted that these objects are at roughly the same temperature as hd  209458  b for very different reasons : the planet is heated by its proximity to the parent star , whereas the temperatures for the other objects are set by their ongoing contraction . )    in the following discussion , we first consider alternate interpretations of our result , then discuss the constraints that we can place on the planetary atmosphere , and finish by looking ahead to near - future complementary observations .",
    "we must take care that the observed decrement is not the result of the distinctive limb - darkening exhibited by the sodium line relative to that of the adjacent continuum . in order to quantify the amplitude of this effect , we generated model transit curves ( for a planet of _ constant _ radius ) as described in ",
    "2.1 , and integrated these in @xmath31 over the nine band passes listed in table  1 .",
    "we then recreated the linear combination of these results as given in eq  ( 4 ) .",
    "we found that the predicted offsets were : @xmath72 these values are much smaller than the signal we detect .",
    "moreover , they are of the opposite sign : since the net decrement toward the limb is less in the sodium line than in the adjacent continuum , the transit as observed in a band centered on the sodium lines would be expected to be _ less _ deep near @xmath13 than that observed in a band in the adjacent spectral region .",
    "we note that the above quantities should be subtracted from the observed values of @xmath51 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 given in equation  ( 5 ) for comparison with future modeling efforts that do not explicitly include the wavelength - dependent limb - darkening . for the purposes of the present paper , our models explicitly account for this effect by making use of the model stellar surface brightness , and",
    "thus no adjustment is needed .",
    "a second concern is that the star might appear _ smaller _ when observed at the wavelength of the sodium lines , producing a deeper transit for the same - sized planet .",
    "in fact , we expect the opposite to be true : the solar limb should be slightly _ larger _ in the core of the na  d lines because of the great opacity in these lines .",
    "model calculations ( e.  h.  avrett , personal communication ) yield an intensity - weighted solar radius increase , after averaging over even the narrowest bandpass containing the na  d lines , of less than 10 km",
    ". this will have a completely negligible effect on the observed transit depth in the bandpass containing the na  d lines .      our fiducial model ( s1 ) , which has cloud tops at 0.04  bar and a solar abundance of sodium in atomic form , predicts values for @xmath51 and @xmath73 that are @xmath753 times deeper than we observe .",
    "this conclusion awaits confirmation from other more detailed models , such as those performed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "here we consider several possible physical effects that may contribute to the reduced sodium absorption relative to the predictions of our model :    it may be that a significant fraction of atomic sodium has combined into molecules , which may either be present as gaseous species , or sequestered from the atmosphere as condensates .",
    "chemical equilibrium models for substellar and planetary atmospheres @xcite indicate that na@xmath76s , nacl , naoh , nah , and more complicated species ( such as naalsi@xmath77o@xmath78 ) may be present in the planetary atmosphere .",
    "in particular , @xcite finds that , at these temperatures , the competition for sodium is predominantly between na@xmath76s ( _ solid _ ) and monatomic na ( _ gas _ ) . at temperatures above the na@xmath76s - condensation line ,",
    "sodium is predominantly in atomic form , and gases such as nacl , naoh , and nah never become the most abundant sodium - bearing species ( k.  lodders , personal communcation ) . if the disparity between the observed values for @xmath51 and @xmath73 and the predictions for these quantities based on our fiducial model ( s1 ) , is due entirely to this effect ( and not , for example , mitigated by the effect of high cloud decks )",
    ", then this would indicate that less than 1  % of the sodium is present in atomic form .",
    "this statement is based on the fact that even our model c3 fails to reproduce the observed values .",
    "our current models @xcite account for the ionization of sodium by the large stellar flux incident upon the planetary atmosphere .",
    "however , it is possible that the effect is larger than predicted by our calculations : this would require a sink for free electrons , the effect of which would be to lower the recombination rate .",
    "perhaps hd  209458 began with a depleted sodium abundance , or , more generally , a depleted metal abundance .",
    "the current picture of gas - giant planet formation predicts that planets should present a metallicity at or above the value observed in the parent star ; jupiter and saturn are certainly metal - rich relative to the sun ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "metallicity appears to play an important role in the formation of planets : parent stars of close - in planets appear to be metal rich @xcite relative to their counterparts in the local solar neighborhood @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the observed lack of close - in giant planets in the globular cluster 47  tuc @xcite may be due , in part , to a reduced planet - formation rate due to the low - metallicity of the globular cluster .",
    "the relationship linking metallicity and planet formation is not clear .",
    "clouds provide a natural means of reducing the sodium absorption , by creating a hard edge to the atmosphere , and thereby reducing the effective area of the atmosphere viewed in transmission . if the difference between the observed values of @xmath51 and @xmath73 and the predictions for these quantities based on our fiducial model ( s1 ) is due entirely to clouds",
    ", then this would require a very high cloud deck , with cloud tops above 0.4  mbar ( model n4 ) .",
    "@xcite have recently produced algorithms to model cloud formation in the atmospheres of extrasolar planets .",
    "the effect of the stellar uv flux on the atmospheric chemistry has not been explicitly included .",
    "we urge investigations of the production of condensates , such as photochemical hazes , by this mechanism .",
    "such photochemical hazes are present in the atmospheres of the gas giants of the solar system , and produce large effects upon the observed reflectance spectra of these bodies @xcite .",
    "the stellar flux incident upon the atmosphere of hd  209458  b is roughly 20,000 times greater than that upon jupiter .      in the present work",
    ", we have demonstrated that by using existing instruments , it is possible to begin the investigation of the atmospheres of planets orbiting other stars .",
    "wide - field surveys conducted by dedicated , small telescopes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) promise to detect numerous close - in , transiting planets over the next few years .",
    "the parent stars of these planets should be sufficiently bright to permit similar studies of the planetary atmosphere .    based on the results presented here , we believe the observed value of sodium absorption from the planetary atmosphere may have resulted from a high cloud deck , a low atomic sodium abundance , or a combination of both .",
    "observations of the transmission spectrum over a broader wavelength range should allow us to distinguish between these two broad categories of models ( figure  8) .",
    "if the effect is predominantly due to clouds , the transmission spectrum from 3001000  nm will show little variation with wavelength , other than additional alkali metal lines . if , on the other hand , the clouds are very deep or not present , then the transmission spectrum may show deep features redward of 500  nm due to water , and absorption due to rayleigh scattering blueward of 500  nm .",
    "these are only two extremes of the many possibilities ; the actual case may share characteristics of both of these effects .",
    "further diagnostics could be provided by near - ir spectroscopy , which could detect features due to molecular species ( such as @xmath79 , co , and @xmath80 ) that are expected to be present in planetary transmission spectra @xcite .",
    "suitable observations in the 15  @xmath24 m region would allow inferences about the atmosphere s thermal structure and composition , permitting a more definite interpretation of the sodium signature .",
    "@xcite have presented preliminary near - ir spectra of hd  209458 in and out of transit .",

    ". predictions for the albedo as a function of wavelength vary by several orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "these observations should be facilitated in the case of a transiting system @xcite .",
    "if possible , the observation of the phase function ( variation in the reflected - light with orbital phase ) would constrain greatly the nature of particulates in the planetary atmosphere @xcite .",
    "observations of molecular absorption features from thermal emission spectra , such as sought in the recent study of the @xmath81  boo system @xcite , would clearly complement these studies .",

    "<S> we report high precision spectrophotometric observations of four planetary transits of hd  209458 , in the region of the sodium resonance doublet at 589.3  nm . we find that the photometric dimming during transit in a bandpass centered on the sodium feature is deeper by @xmath0 relative to simultaneous observations of the transit in adjacent bands . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret this additional dimming as absorption from sodium in the planetary atmosphere , as recently predicted from several theoretical modeling efforts . </S>",
    "<S> our model for a cloudless planetary atmosphere with a solar abundance of sodium in atomic form predicts more sodium absorption than we observe . </S>",
    "<S> there are several possibilities that may account for this reduced amplitude , including reaction of atomic sodium into molecular gases and/or condensates , photoionization of sodium by the stellar flux , a low primordial abundance of sodium , or the presence of clouds high in the atmosphere . </S>"
