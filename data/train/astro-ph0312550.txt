    "our understanding of the mechanisms and timescales of the formation of the very first luminous galaxies in the universe is still very uncertain .",
    "many detailed studies of local luminous early - type galaxies favor formation at very early epochs and within a very short time span ( _ e.g.,_@xcite and references therein ) . in particular , the @xmath5 elements are enhanced in luminous ellipticals relative to fe ( _ e.g. , _",
    "@xcite ) , this enhancement is strongly correlated with the central velocity dispersion @xmath6 @xcite , and the relation is similar for field and cluster ellipticals @xcite .",
    "galaxies with the oldest stellar populations are both the most luminous and the most @xmath5 enhanced @xcite . if these claims are valid , the most luminous galaxies formed within a quite short period very early in the history of the universe , less luminous early - type galaxies formed more gradually and somewhat later , and differences in star formation histories between ellipticals in the field and those in clusters are relatively minor .",
    "this last statement is also supported by fundamental - plane analyses ( _ e.g. , _  @xcite ; but see also @xcite ) .",
    "such conclusions appear to be difficult to reconcile with standard interpretations of the results of the semi - analytic cold - dark - matter ( cdm ) models ( _ e.g. , _  @xcite ) , which predict that , for the currently favored low - density cosmology ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ; assumed throughout this paper ) , most of the present - day bright ellipticals will have undergone final assembly between @xmath10 and @xmath11",
    ". however , there are at least two caveats to this statement : ( 1 ) one of the least certain parts of the semi - analytic cdm models is the treatment of star formation and resulting feedback effects , and it is possible that different assumptions in this area could mitigate at least some of the discrepancy ; and ( 2 ) _ assembly _ at relatively low redshifts is not necessarily inconsistent with formation of most of the stars at much higher redshifts .",
    "nevertheless , both the color - luminosity relationship for spheroids @xcite and the correlation of @xmath5-element enhancement with luminosity show that the formation of the stellar population and the assembly of the galaxy can not be completely independent processes .",
    "as @xcite has succinctly put it , `` it seems as if the stars in ellipticals were formed at a time when the depth of the potential well that they would eventually inhabit was already determined . ''    in this context , it is of considerable interest to seek out and to investigate the galaxies with the oldest stellar populations at any given redshift . while such galaxies may not be typical , they can establish one end of the range of realistic formation scenarios , and they likely have less complicated star - formation histories than most .",
    "furthermore , they may , in fact , be more representative of the formation of the bulk of the stars in early - type galaxies generally than might at first seem likely , since a miniscule contamination of young stars in a galaxy can drastically alter its rest - frame ultraviolet colors and eliminate such galaxies from color - selected samples .",
    "there has been much recent activity in observations and discussion of so - called _ extremely red objects _ ( eros ; _",
    "@xcite ; earlier references can be found in these papers ) .",
    "these objects , which are often defined to have @xmath12 or @xmath13 , include two disparate classes .",
    "some are highly reddened high - redshift starbursts ( _ e.g. , _  @xcite ) .",
    "the remainder are almost exclusively galaxies with @xmath14 whose stellar populations are already ancient and have little admixture from more recent star formation @xcite . for convenience",
    ", we shall henceforth simply refer to this latter class as `` old galaxies '' ( ogs ) ; but note once again that this term refers to the age of the stellar population , with no necessary implication regarding the age of assembly of the galaxy itself , aside from the sorts of constraints mentioned above . in any case",
    ", these ogs seem to represent the earliest major episodes of star formation in the universe .",
    "the actual ages of the dominant stellar population in the small number of identified ogs that have been studied in detail have generated some controversy because of disagreements about spectral synthesis models and their interpretation ( see , _ e.g. , _  @xcite and references therein ) . however , a minimum age of 2 gyr for the oldest objects at @xmath15 is accepted by virtually everyone , and there are good reasons for believing that some , at least , have ages between 3 and 4 gyr @xcite . if these latter age estimates are correct , then the precursors of these galaxies will still have essentially fully formed stellar populations at higher redshifts .",
    "for example , for our assumed cosmological parameters , galaxies at @xmath16 will be @xmath17 gyr younger than at @xmath18 .",
    "this means that @xmath18 galaxies for which the last major episode of star formation occurred between 3 and 4 gyr earlier might be expected to be fairly well settled and have small average internal extinction at @xmath16 , and probably at even higher redshifts .",
    "many surveys of eros have made the assumption , explicit or not , that a dominant spheroidal component ( in mass , if not in light ) is a necessary condition for the presence of an old stellar population at high redshifts ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paper ,",
    "we describe the first object among those found in our search for ogs in radio source fields at @xmath19 that we have been able to investigate in some detail , and we show that it is a luminous disk galaxy , with little or no bulge component , comprising very old stars .",
    "we have recently concluded a search for ogs in the fields of quasars at @xmath15 ( * ? ? ? *",
    "stockton et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "radio source fields are generally likely to include regions of higher - than - average density in the early universe ( _ e.g. , _",
    "@xcite ) , in which processes of galaxy formation and evolution are expected to have proceeded more rapidly than in the field . more importantly , looking for companions to radio sources at a specific redshift allows us to choose redshifts for which the photometric diagnostics from standard broadband filters give the cleanest separation between old galaxy populations and other possible contaminants , such as the dusty starbursts mentioned above .",
    "the relevant key redshifts for our present purposes are @xmath15 ( 4000   break just shortward of the @xmath20 band ) and @xmath19 ( break between @xmath20 and @xmath21 bands ) .",
    "assume that , for the brighter ogs from our sample at @xmath15 , essentially all of their stars formed within 500 myr of the big bang ( corresponding to a stellar population age of 3.7 gyr at @xmath18 ) . for passive evolution of the stellar population , one finds from solar metallicity models ( see @xcite ; we have used the 2000 versions of the models for analysis here unless otherwise specified ) that the precursors of such galaxies at @xmath19 would have @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "this assumption is deliberately an extreme one : if our assumed age ( corresponding to @xmath25 ) is too high , then these magnitudes are all a bit pessimistic .",
    "our approach has been first to obtain imaging to @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , looking for objects in the field with @xmath30 .",
    "if any likely candidates are present , we obtain deeper imaging at @xmath20 and @xmath31 , and include imaging in the @xmath21 band . most of the infrared observations ( including all of those relevant to this paper ) have been obtained with the infrared camera cisco @xcite on the 8.2 m subaru telescope on mauna kea .",
    "the detector is a rockwell @xmath32 hg - cd - te hawaii-2 array , with a pixel scale of 0105 and thus a field of just under 2 .",
    "additional @xmath33-band imaging was obtained with esi on the keck ii telescope .",
    "our sample comprises 87 radio - source fields from the texas catalog @xcite selected with the help of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) to have redshifts in the range @xmath34 and @xmath35 , based on the galactic extinction estimates of @xcite .",
    "the coverage we have been able to achieve so far on these fields has been largely determined by telescope scheduling and weather .",
    "we currently have adequate observations for 10 fields , of which at least 3 have objects that have well characterized spectral - energy distributions ( seds ) that closely match those expected for old stellar populations at the redshifts of the radio sources , with little intrinsic reddening .",
    "general results for this survey will be given elsewhere ; here we concentrate on one galaxy , found in the field of the radio galaxy 4c23.56 , for which we have both strong constraints on the sed and adaptive - optics ( ao ) imaging .",
    "a finding chart for the object is shown in fig",
    ".  [ fchart ] . although it was found independently in our survey ,",
    "this galaxy was previously noted as a very red galaxy by @xcite in their comprehensive study of the field of 4c23.56 .",
    "the galaxy is number 68 in their table 4 , and we will refer to it as 4c23.56 kc68 , or , more briefly , simply as kc68 .",
    "the photometry for 4c23.56 kc68 is shown in fig .",
    "the magnitudes , prior to galactic reddening correction , are @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) , @xmath38 ( @xmath37 ) , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "we have used the photometric redshift code hyperz@xcite to explore possible fits to the photometric data , and some of these model seds are also shown in fig .",
    "the fitting procedure allowed redshifts @xmath42 , internal extinction corrections @xmath43 ( assuming a @xcite reddening law ) , and a full range of solar - metallicity stellar population models , including both single - burst models as well as models incorporating various rates of continuing star formation .",
    "within this parameter space , several general conclusions emerged :    1 .   only single - burst models produced good fits .",
    "this is presumably because significant continuing star formation would weaken the sharp inflection shortward of the @xmath21-band point and/or violate the @xmath33 and @xmath44-band upper limits .",
    "the redshift is strongly constrained to the range @xmath45 .",
    "figure [ chi2 ] shows the @xmath46 statistic for the fits as a function of redshift .",
    "when redshift was left as a free parameter , the fits tended to home in on @xmath47 , with a 99%confidence interval @xmath48 . if one assumes the galaxy to be a member of a cluster associated with 4c23.56 and therefore fixes the redshift at 2.483 , a fairly respectable solution exists with an age of 2.6 gyr and a modest internal extinction @xmath49 mag .",
    "although the lowest reduced @xmath46 was obtained for an old ( 3.0 gyr ) population with @xmath50 , to some extent it is possible to trade younger populations for increased reddening .",
    "however , this exchange can not be carried too far : for ages @xmath51 gyr the rapid rise in the flux at rest - frame 2000  , coupled with the bluer colors longward of 4000  , prevents the underlying continuum from being massaged to give a reasonable fit to the photometry by any amount of calzetti - like extinction .",
    "table [ models ] gives parameters for the three models shown in fig .",
    "[ sed ] , which are representative of the range of plausible fits to the photometry .",
    "ccccc 1 & 2.340 & 3.0 & 0.14 & 1.128 + 2 & 2.483 & 2.6 & 0.16 & 1.832 + 3 & 2.340 & 1.0 & 1.10 & 1.877 +    note that , because of the well - known age - metallicity degeneracy , we can obtain younger ages by allowing super - solar metallicities .",
    "such a trade - off means , for example , that even though some of the ages in table [ models ] exceed the age of the universe for the given redshift and our assumed cosmological parameters ( _ i.e. , _  2.75 gyr at @xmath52 ; 2.59 gyr at @xmath53 ) , these excess ages can be considered proxies for high metallicities . at a redshift of 2.48 ,",
    "an @xmath54 elliptical with a 2.1-gyr - old solar - metallicity stellar population would have @xmath55 in the observed frame , so the observed @xmath56 ( after correction for galactic extinction ) for kc68 implies a luminosity of about @xmath4 .",
    "this mass associated with this luminosity is not strongly dependent on metallicity , the differential effect between solar and twice solar metallicities being a reduction in the inferred mass by about 10% .",
    "the galaxy 4c23.56 kc68 happens to lie @xmath57 from a 14th mag star , and we have been able to obtain adaptive - optics ( ao ) imaging , using the subaru 36-element , curvature - sensing ao system and the infrared camera and spectrograph ( ircs ; @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath32 aladdin3 array had a pixel scale of 00225 , giving a field of 230 .",
    "the total exposure was 12,600  s , all in the @xmath31 filter .",
    "figure [ aowide ] shows a section of the ao - imaged field .",

    "[ aowide ] show larger - scale images of kc68 at two contrast levels .",
    "the galaxy clearly has a high degree of symmetry , showing that @xmath58 galaxies , comprising relaxed old stellar populations , can be in place by the time the universe is only 2.6 gyr old .",
    "we can explore this morphology in more detail by making model fits to the image .",
    "we have used c.  y.  peng s galfitroutine @xcite to fit two - dimensional models corresponding to de vaucouleurs ( @xmath2-law ) , exponential , and general srsic profiles@xcite , all convolved with the psf .",
    "figure [ 2dmod ] shows these models and the residuals after subtraction from the observed image .",
    "although a pure exponential model is an excellent fit , the formal best fit is for a srsic model with an index @xmath3 , an effective radius @xmath59 ( @xmath60 kpc ) , and an axial ratio @xmath61 .",
    "these numbers tend to confirm one s visual impression that the galaxy is disk - like in morphology . while one can not exclude the possibility of a small @xmath2-law bulge component , all of our attempts to model the galaxy as a two - component ( @xmath2-law + exponential ) system resulted in the @xmath2-law - component being given an extremely large effective radius ( regardless of the initial parameter settings ) , essentially smearing it into the sky background .    for a more quantitative view , fig .",
    "[ sbp ] shows the surface - brightness profile of kc68 , along with seeing - convolved model fits .",
    "it is clear from the left panel that an @xmath2-law model can not adequately fit the profile , and that an exponential model gives a much better fit .",
    "the right panel shows the best srsic - profile fit .",
    "the identification of this galaxy and the other two ( mentioned in  [ photsect ] ) at @xmath19 that we have found so far with strikingly dominant old stellar populations demonstrates that at least some massive galaxies have completed virtually all of their star formation at sufficiently early times that they are no longer heavily dust - enshrouded at this redshift . of these",
    ", at least 4c23.56 kc68 has also achieved a relaxed regular morphology .",
    "the surprise is that this relaxed configuration seems to be very close to a pure disk , rather than to a spheroid , or even to a spheroid + disk .",
    "there is abundant evidence that the large ( @xmath62% ) fraction of s0 galaxies seen in rich clusters at the present epoch drops dramatically at higher redshifts @xcite , with the slack being taken up by spirals , and with the proportion of elliptical galaxies remaining roughly constant .",
    "the mechanisms for the apparent conversion of spirals into s0 galaxies have been widely discussed ever since @xcite first noticed the increasing fraction of blue galaxies in clusters at high redshifts ( see , _",
    "@xcite for a recent example ) .    however , there is also evidence to support the classical view that at least a significant fraction of the s0 population consists of galaxies that formed coevally with the oldest ellipticals @xcite . @xcite",
    "have described an s0-like galaxy at @xmath15 .",
    "in addition , recent large surveys find that a substantial fraction of objects identified as eros have disks ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , and the only galaxy in our own sample of galaxies at @xmath15 with old stellar populations @xcite for which we have good ao imaging also is dominated by an exponential profile ( stockton et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . at a higher redshifts , @xcite have identified a sample of large , disk - like galaxies , one of which has fairly red colors @xcite and is at @xmath63 .",
    "all of these cases appear still to have significant ( and usually dominant ) bulge components . indeed , one of the principal points of @xcite is that the galaxy they describe may be a spheroid in the process of acquiring a disk , validating a commonly proposed scenario for the evolution of early - type spirals . in other words ,",
    "the reason that this particular galaxy is classified as an ero lies in the dominance of the bulge population and the weakness and low star - formation rate of the disk component .",
    "many other galaxies classified as eros also show discrete star - forming regions , but in these cases , too , the bulge population seems to dominate the colors used for the classification .",
    "the galaxy we are discussing here poses a much more radical challenge to our understanding of the formation of old stellar populations at high redshifts : kc68 appears to be a @xmath58 galaxy of old stars having a disk - like morphology , with no significant bulge component .",
    "as indicated below , this galaxy seems so difficult to fit into the standard cold - dark - matter ( cdm ) picture of early galaxy formation that it is worth briefly revisiting the steps by which we have reached this conclusion .",
    "_ could the redshift be seriously in error?_certainly for low extinction , the photometric redshift seems quite unambiguous ( see fig .",
    "[ chi2 ] ) . for the @xcite reddening law , this conclusion remains for the highest extinctions we have considered .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility that one could contrive a reddening law that could result in a reasonable fit at a different redshift , for sufficiently high extinction .",
    "however , the high degree of symmetry shown by the galaxy does not fit the fairly chaotic morphology usually shown by galaxies having large amounts of dust .",
    "we believe that a redshift outside of the range @xmath45 is extremely unlikely .    _ are the stars really old?_we have seen in  [ photsect ] that reddening alone can not reproduce the observed sed , including the sharp inflection shortward of the @xmath21 band and the tight constraints on the flux at rest - frame 2000   and 2400    given by the @xmath33 and @xmath44-band upper limits .",
    "( this conclusion strictly assumes a @xcite reddening law ; but the statement almost certainly holds for any plausible reddening law ) .",
    "it is necessary to have a strong break in the underlying spectrum , even if reddening is substantial .",
    "younger ages produce progressively worse fits , and ages @xmath64 gyr do not seem at all likely , provided only that the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is not pathologically deficient in high - mass stars . of course",
    ", one can make the stellar population as young as one wishes by an _",
    "ad hoc _ truncation of the imf above about @xmath65 ( _ e.g. , _",
    "@xcite ) . for standard imfs ( _ e.g. ,",
    "_  salpeter or miller - scalo ) , increasing the metallicity above solar can potentially give a slightly younger age .",
    "experiments with the recent @xcite models show that the gross seds of solar - metallicity models can be reproduced by models at 2.5 times solar metallicity with ages reduced by about 30% .",
    "however , any real stellar population will have a range of metallicities , and chemically consistent evolutionary synthesis models ( _ e.g. , _  @xcite ) show that populations with mass - weighted metallicities that are much higher than solar can still have integrated fluxes dominated by stars with sub - solar metallicities in the rest - frame near - uv , where line blanketing is important .",
    "this effect means that ages estimated from solar - metallicity models are unlikely to be serious overestimates @xcite . in the case of kc68",
    ", there seems to be no way to avoid requiring almost all of the stars to be close to 1 gyr old or older .",
    "furthermore , such solutions are about a factor of 3 less probable than the best fit , which is for a very old ( 23 gyr ) population with little reddening .",
    "thus , it is likely that the most recent significant star formation in 4c23.56 kc68 occurred when the universe was @xmath64 gyr old , although we can not completely exclude somewhat later times .",
    "( note that if we were to assume the fairly extreme solution of a 1-gyr - old population with internal reddening of @xmath66 mag , the star formation would have to be essentially complete by @xmath67 , when the age of the universe would have been 1.6 gyr ) .",
    "the important point remains , in any case , that there can not have been significant recent star formation .",
    "_ is the morphology really disk - like?_as we have stated in  [ aosect ] , we can not exclude the possibility of a small @xmath2-law component , but any such component seems to be insignificant in terms of the total luminosity of the system . the small projected axial ratio and the good fit to a pure exponential profile",
    "indicate that the system is strongly dominated by a disk .    in sum",
    ", the most straightforward and plausible interpretation remains that 4c23.56 kc68 is a well - settled disk of old stars at a redshift close to that of 4c23.56 itself .",
    "if this interpretation is indeed correct , what are the consequences ?",
    "firstly , something very close to the classical picture of monolithic collapse must have occurred , with the important proviso that vigorous star formation did not begin until after the gas had settled into a disk .",
    "secondly , star formation must have proceeded at an extremely rapid rate in order to form the required @xmath68 of stars over a time span that could not possibly be much more than @xmath69 years and that was probably more like a few @xmath70 years .",
    "thirdly , the star formation and processes associated with it must have been very efficient at processing and expelling the gas in order to have strongly quenched any subsequent significant star formation .    in hierarchical formation models ,",
    "including the standard cdm picture , galaxy morphologies are largely a reflection of their merger and accretion histories up to the epoch at which they are observed ( _ e.g. , _",
    "@xcite ) . semi - analytic models of galaxy formation ( _ e.g. , _",
    "@xcite ) suggest that most massive spheroids underwent final assembly between redshifts of 1 and 2 , and that most large spiral disks were gradually acquired by smooth accretion of cold gas at redshifts @xmath71 and lower , after the last major merger @xcite .",
    "there appears to be little place in this scenario for a galaxy like 4c23.56 kc68 , for at least two reasons : ( 1 ) the implied prodigious star formation rate , which has to have been sustained for a few @xmath70 years _ without _ the help of a major merging event ( as indicated by the lack of a detectable bulge ) , and ( 2 ) the building up of a massive galaxy apparently by smooth accretion of cold gas , without any evidence for significant hierarchical merging .",
    "we of course can not say from this one example whether similar galaxies are common at high redshifts .",
    "if they are , they would in one sense be the perfect progenitors for spheroidals : they comprise natural reservoirs of stars formed over very short periods of time in deep potential wells at early epochs .",
    "in short , their stars have all of the properties needed to explain the color - luminosity and alpha - element - luminosity relations for spheroidals , provided only that the morphological transformation from disks to spheroidals results from mergers of a small number of massive disk galaxies @xcite .",
    "one obvious course for the future would be to explore the morphologies of galaxies selected in the same way as kc68 was with high resolution imaging , either with nicmos on _ hst _ , or with laser - guide - star ao on large ground - based telescopes .",

    "<S> we describe observations of a galaxy in the field of the @xmath0 radio galaxy 4c23.56 , photometrically selected to have a spectral - energy distribution consistent with an old stellar population at the redshift of the radio galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> exploration of redshift  stellar - population  </S>",
    "<S> reddening constraints from the photometry indicates that the galaxy is indeed at a redshift close to that of 4c23.56 , that the age of the most recent significant star formation is roughly @xmath1 gyr , and that reddening is fairly modest , with more reddening required for the younger end of stellar age range . from analysis of a deep adaptive - optics image of the galaxy </S>",
    "<S> , we find that an @xmath2-law profile , common for local spheroidal galaxies , can be excluded quite strongly . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , a pure exponential profile fits remarkably well , while the best fit is given by a srsic profile with index @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> reconstruction of the two - dimensional form of the galaxy from the best - fit model is consistent with a disk galaxy with neither a significant bulge component nor gross azimuthal structure . </S>",
    "<S> the assembly of roughly @xmath4 of old stars into such a configuration this early in the history of the universe is not easily explainable by any of the currently popular scenarios for galaxy formation . </S>",
    "<S> a galaxy with these properties would seem to require smooth but rapid infall of the large mass of gas involved , followed by a burst of extremely vigorous and efficient star formation in the resulting disk . </S>"
