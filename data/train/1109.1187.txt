    "in our ( 3 + 1)-dimensional universe , gravity is the weakest of all forces  @xcite .",
    "the fact that the electroweak scale ( @xmath2(0.1  1  tev ) ) is so much lower than the scale when gravity becomes strong ( known as the planck scale and is @xmath2(10@xmath3  tev ) ) is known as the hierarchy problem  @xcite .    in this letter ,",
    "two different theories that attempt to solve or alleviate the hierarchy problem are discussed , with both theories involving extra dimensions .",
    "the first model , proposed by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos , and dvali ( add model )  @xcite , postulates that gauge interactions are localized on a ( 3 + 1 ) brane and gravity propagates in @xmath4 large , flat extra dimensions , compactified on a torus or sphere with radius @xmath5 .",
    "the multidimensional planck scale ( @xmath6 ) is related to fundamental planck scale ( @xmath7 ) as : @xmath8 , where @xmath5 is the size of extra dimensions . for @xmath9  tev ( or in other words ,",
    "comparable to electroweak scale ) , @xmath5 can be as large as @xmath10  m for @xmath11 and rapidly decreases to 3  nm for @xmath12 , @xmath13  m for @xmath14 , and so on .    another possible solution of the hierarchy problem is due to a virtual graviton exchange in extra dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the result is a non - resonant production of dileptons or diphotons at high masses , that appear as a continuum spectrum of kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations separated by energy gaps inversely proportional to the size of extra dimensions , @xmath5 .",
    "typical values of @xmath15 for number of extra dimensions of 2 , 4 , and 6 are 40  mev , 40  kev , and 10  mev , respectively .",
    "the summation over all kk modes diverges , hence , an ultraviolet cutoff ( model - dependent ) is required .",
    "there are more than one possible scenarios  @xcite , in which the effects of the virtual graviton production are parameterized differently  this will be described in more details in the respective sections of this letter . finally , a resonant production of diphotons by means of randall - sundrum ( rs ) graviton decay is possible  @xcite . in this model",
    ", gravity appears strengthened in only one extra dimension ( rs-1 model ) due to its warped geometry .",
    "the model parameters are the curvature of the metric ( @xmath16 ) , mass of the first excitation ( @xmath17 ) , and the ultraviolet cutoff scale ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "often , a dimensionless parameter @xmath19 is used instead of the curvature .",
    "the searches are carried out by the compact muon solenoid ( cms ) collaboration using @xmath0 collisions at the center - of - mass energy @xmath20  tev at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the detailed description of the cms detector can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the data for the searches described in this letter have been taken during the 2010 and 2011 lhc runs and correspond to an integrated luminosity of up to 1.1  fb@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "one of the consequences of a strengthened gravitational field in extra dimensions is possibility of microscopic black holes formation if the impact parameter of two colliding particles is smaller then a @xmath21-dimensional schwarzschild radius ( @xmath22 )  @xcite : @xmath23}^{\\frac{1}{n + 1 } } , $ ] where @xmath24 is the mass of a black hole .",
    "the production cross section of such black holes is @xmath25 and can reach hundreds of picobarns , which makes search for such objects promising at the lhc . in our current understanding of a model , in the semiclassical approximation , the minimum allowed mass of a black hole @xmath26 is some 3  5 times larger than the @xmath27 , although the formation threshold can be even larger . in cases when the semiclassical approximation no longer holds ,",
    "string balls  @xcite may offer a better description of the formation of a black hole .",
    "string balls are considered to be precursors of black holes , with mass being close to the planck scale .",
    "they are described by the string scale @xmath18 and the string coupling @xmath28 .",
    "the properties of string balls are similar to that of black holes : once produced , they both decay thermally into all standard model ( sm ) degrees of freedom . since quarks and gluons carry color charge , they are the main decay products ( @xmath29 ) .    on average , half a dozen energetic particles",
    "is expected in the final state , which drives the analysis strategy .",
    "this search  @xcite is based on @xmath30  fb@xmath1 of collision data , and is an update of two previous searches  @xcite .",
    "events are pre - selected based on the total jet activity triggers with scalar sum of central ( with pseudorapidity @xmath31 , where @xmath32 $ ] , @xmath33 is the polar angle measured from the nominal detector center with respect to the direction of the counterclockwise proton beam ) jets transverse energies ( @xmath34 ) between 350 and 550  gev .",
    "offline , @xmath35 is the main variable that is used to discriminate the signal and the background .",
    "it is defined as a scalar sum of the @xmath34 ( or transverse momentum @xmath36 for muons ) of all isolated and non - overlapping jets , photons , electrons , and muons that pass loose object identification requirements and have @xmath37  gev .",
    "if missing transverse energy ( @xmath38 ) is greater than 50  gev , it is added to the @xmath35 .",
    "the total number of reconstructed objects ( excluding @xmath38 ) is called multiplicity , @xmath39 , and is used in the offline selection . to avoid",
    "trigger and multi - particle turn - ons , events with @xmath40  gev are rejected .",
    "note that by construction , particle identification efficiency does not affect the @xmath35 distribution , since if an electron does not pass the identification requirements it is either classified as a photon , or as a jet ; photon failing the selection will become a jet ; and a rejected muon will contribute to @xmath38 .",
    "the backgrounds to the black hole signals include @xmath41+jets ( where @xmath42 ) and multijet qcd production .",
    "the former backgrounds are negligibly small at high @xmath35 , and are omitted in the analysis .",
    "the dominant qcd background is estimated using a data - driven technique that is based on the assumption that the @xmath35 shape is invariant of the multiplicity of the final state .",
    "the @xmath35 distributions in data for @xmath43 ( almost completely dominated by hard qcd @xmath44 scattering ) and @xmath45 are fitted between 800 and 2500  gev ( where no signal is expected ) with three ansatz functions : the one with the best @xmath46/n.d.f .",
