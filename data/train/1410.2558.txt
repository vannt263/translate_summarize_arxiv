    "mysos are difficult to detect since they are located at large distances , with a tendency to form in complicated cluster environments , and evolve on a much shorter evolutionary timescale compared to low - mass stars .",
    "it is important , therefore , to identify more candidates of massive stars in early evolutionary stages to ascertain whether jets are present , and if so , to study their role during the formation process .",

    ", it should be now possible to explore photo - ionized regions around stars of spectral type later than b2 throughout the galaxy .",
    "the orientation of the 4 putative stars is approximately along the dark filament as might be expected for star formation in this environment .",
    "a similar alignment of proto - stellar objects along the dark cloud has for instance been observed in the region g28.34 + 0.06 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , in the latter case the sources have separations of the order of @xmath50pc , whereas in g11p1 there are 4 sources within a distance of @xmath51au ( 0.04 pc at the distance of g11p1 ) .",
    "several massive objects can in fact be found at such small and even smaller separation in young clusters ( e.g. orion trapezium ; ngc@xmath02071 : @xcite ) .",
    "we will thus first consider the formation of 4 massive stars aligned along the filament .",
    "an argument against the hypothesis that the 4 radio sources are ionized by 4 individual stars can be made if we consider the implied luminosities from 4 individual stars .",
    "assuming optically thin free - free emission and neglecting absorption of ionizing photons within the uc / hchii regions we calculated the lyman continuum luminosity for each component using the formulas given in @xcite . using the tabulation in @xcite , the corresponding spectral types are approximately b2/b3 for each radio component . due to the assumptions made in the calculation , these values are lower limits .",
    "such stars have a luminosity of @xmath52l@xmath15 , hence for four such stars we would predict a luminosity of the region of more than @xmath53l@xmath15 , which is much larger than the measured luminosity of the region of about 1200 l@xmath15 ( p06 ) or 1346 l@xmath15 .",
    "therefore the hypothesis of 4 individual uc / hchii regions can be excluded .",
    "next , we can ask whether external photoionization can explain the 4 radio sources . in this scenario 4",
    "clumps are externally ionized by an unseen massive protostar .",
    "the position of the putative accretion disk traced by @xmath54ghz methanol masers ( p06 ) lies somewhat offset from the line defined by the 4 radio sources ( see figure [ f4 ] ) .",
    "we calculated the necessary flux of ionizing photons correcting for the ratio of solid angle @xmath55 of the radio sources as seen from the position of the methanol maser source . for the calculation we assumed source sizes of half of the synthesized beam , likely an overestimate resulting in a lower limit on the corrected ionizing flux . to externally ionize the four components we find that a single star of spectral type b1 or earlier would be required .",
    "such stars have luminosities of @xmath56 l@xmath15 , which is also in conflict with the measured luminosity of the region . a calculation placing the star at the peak position of radio continuum source b",
    "gives similar results .",
    "we conclude that direct photoionization of the cm components from a single massive proto - stellar objects is unlikely .",
    "we suggest therefore that the radio continuum emission detected towards g11p1 is produced by shock ionization . this could be the result of either accretion shocks caused by supersonic infall onto an accretion disk , or shocks caused by the interaction of a stellar wind with surrounding molecular core matter .",
    "the expected radio continuum emission from accretion shocks has been calculated by @xcite ; at the distance of g11p1 , and assuming a mass of @xmath57m@xmath58 ( p06 ) , their model predicts a @xmath59ghz flux density of below @xmath60jy for an accretion rate of @xmath61m@xmath62yr@xmath32 .",
    "thus , unless one wants to accept an unusually large accretion rate , the accretion shock scenario seems to be ruled out . on the other hand , a scenario where a neutral wind driven by the embedded massive protostar shocks against surrounding high - density matter and produces free - free emission ( @xcite and references therein ) , appears more likely .    before discussing this scenario in more detail below",
    ", we note that the above luminosity argument could also be made consistent with the data if we assume that only one of the four radio sources is a uc / hchii region and the other sources are shock - ionized",
    ". the spectral behavior of component b is close to that of an optically thin hii region , hence we have considered this possibility as well .",
    "p06 and have estimated a molecular hydrogen density of @xmath63@xmath10 , and a temperature of @xmath64k for the g11p1 central core . including also the turbulent pressure of the molecular gas given by the fwhm of the hot nh@xmath17 component ( @xmath65km@xmath0s@xmath32 ) , we have calculated the size of an uc / hchii region around a b3 zams star given by the condition of pressure equilibrium between molecular and ionized gas using the formulas of @xcite .",
    "we obtain a size of about @xmath66au , which is consistent with the region being unresolved in our observations .",
    "thus , our data do not exclude a uc / hchii region interpretation for component b ( only ) , plus cm emission from 3 shocked regions .",
    "these 3 continuum sources could then be either separate jets from individual proto - stars which are unresolved , or several shocks from a single jet , likely caused by episodic matter ejection .",
    "we also note that if one adopts the empirical correlation between radio and bolometric luminosity of @xcite an interpretation of the radio sources as four independent lower mass stars is not excluded by the measured luminosity .    because of the alignment and orientation of the 4 radio sources with respect to several disk tracers ( see below ) we will favor shock ionization from a single jet as the likely physical scenario for the cm emission . in this picture a massive star in or near component b drives a bipolar jet which causes the observed radio emission when the ejecta interact with the surrounding core matter . assuming then that the radio emission detected at g11p1 originates from a jet",
    ", we use the standard model of @xcite for free - free emission of a collimated , ionized flow or wind , with constant velocity , temperature and ionization fraction .",
    "reynolds model suggests that the observed flux density and the angular size depend on frequency as @xmath67 and @xmath68 , where @xmath69 depends on the geometry of the jet and is the power - law index that describes the dependence of the jet half - width on the distance from the jet origin @xcite . for the g11p1 component",
    "b , the observed dependence of the flux density with frequency gives a value of @xmath70 , which within the uncertainties , is in agreement with a collimated ionized jet .",
    "the angular size dependence with frequency can not be determined for any of the components since they are all unresolved with our angular resolution .",
    "using equation 19 from @xcite we can make a rough estimate of the mass - loss rate ( @xmath71 ) of the g11p1 b - component , assuming parameter values that are typical of jets associated with luminous objects ( @xmath72= 700 km s@xmath32 ; @xmath73rad ; t@xmath74 k , @xmath75 , @xmath76 ; e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the estimated mass loss rate of g11p1 component b observed at 25.5 ghz is @xmath77 m@xmath15yr@xmath32 .",
    "we can get an estimated value of the momentum rate ( @xmath78 ) by multiplying the mass loss rate by the typical velocity of the wind in massive stars , which gives @xmath79 m@xmath15yr@xmath32 kms@xmath32 . on the other hand , if we assume that component b is a jet produced by shock induced ionization with a shock efficiency ( @xmath80 ) @xmath50.1 and an optical depth of the emission at 25.5 ghz of  0.02 , the estimated momentum rate is @xmath81 m@xmath15yr@xmath32 kms@xmath32 .",

    "the presence of the @xmath54ghz ch@xmath14oh and @xmath93ghz h@xmath13o masers are strong indicators of massive star formation , and the presence of a massive core ( e.g. 240 m@xmath15 , ) allows in principle to accrete more mass .",
    "the relative youth of this system is demonstrated by the fact that most of the molecular gas in the core appears to be quite cold : p06 report a temperature of only @xmath94k for the overall molecular core based on nh@xmath14 observations .",
    "whether or not the central object in g11p1 is in fact accumulating more mass and will grow to a massive star can in principle be observationally decided by the detection of outflow activity , because flows and jets are thought to be intimately linked to mass accretion .",
    "the molecular line observations of resulted in the detection of non - gaussian line wings , and a possible outflow traced by the ch@xmath14oh(2@xmath95 ) lines .",
    "this was recently confirmed by @xcite who found an east  west outflow in the sio(54 ) line . in the previous section",
    "we have argued that the radio continuum emission from g11p1 is best explained by an ionized jet , and we hence add to the picture an outflow tracer very near the protostar .",
    "how do the results described in this paper fit into the picture of a massive protostar with a disk / jet system as defined by previous observations ?",
    "we first note that the @xmath54ghz ch@xmath14oh maser is located not on the axis defined by the radio continuum sources ( see fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ) , but is offset by about @xmath96 . according to p06 the astrometrical uncertainty of their measurement is of that order , so that the maser could in fact be located nearer to the jet axis as expected if the maser spots arise in an accretion disk .",
    "fitting individual gaussians to different channels within the maser line p06 find a linear structure of length @xmath97 oriented approximately north  south .",
    "such linear structures have often been observed for the @xmath54ghz ch@xmath14oh maser line ( e.g. ) , however the interpretation as disk tracer is not unique , as similar structures are expected in shock fronts associated with outflows .",
    "in fact , in the scenario where the nir knots ( uk5 and uk6 ) are scattered light at the outflow cavities , a linearly distributed maser emission might be then tracing the walls of the outflow cavities ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we also note that there is a maser listed in the @xmath54ghz methanol multi - beam maser catalogue of @xcite which position is different by more than @xmath98 from the position given in p06 . to clarify these issues , higher angular resolution observations of this maser with high astrometric precision",
    "are needed .",
    "as mentioned above , the ch@xmath14oh and sio line observations of and @xcite , respectively , suggest a molecular flow from the massive star in g11p1 along the east  west direction , and this orientation is consistent with the north - south orientation of the ch@xmath17oh maser disk postulated by p06 .",
    "the outflow direction defined by the cm continuum sources is closer to ne - sw , and in this case we also have a perpendicular component tracing a possible disk , namely the nir emission discussed in the previous section .",
    "additional evidence for this disk component comes from the recent sma and vla observations of @xcite .",
    "their figure  11 shows that the @xmath99 m dust emission is oriented nearly perpendicular to the ionized jet , and the nh@xmath17(2,2 ) line shows a clear velocity gradient along that same direction . both dust emission and nh@xmath17(2,2 )",
    "are more likely to trace dense matter present in a disk / torus system than a molecular outflow .",
    "this apparent contradiction of the different flow orientations can then be explained in at least two ways .",
    "first , it is possible that a second protostar is responsible for the east - west outflow , whereas the flow associated with the radio jet has not been detected .",
    "second , a change of alignment of flow axis on different length scales is a known phenomenon , e.g. in the case of the massive protostar in iras@xmath020126@xmath464104 , the jet axis changes from a nw  se orientation on arc - second scales to a north  south direction when probed by co on arc - minutes scales @xcite .",
    "another well known case where a misalignment of outflow axis is observed is the protostar ngc@xmath07538 irs1 ; describe a number of possible disk precession mechanisms which could explain such changes in the flow axis .",
    "if this is the the case for the g11p1 protostar , the outflow angle would have to change by @xmath100 from the @xmath98 scale of the ionized jet , to the @xmath101 scale where the molecular flows have been detected in sio and ch@xmath17oh .",
    "previous studies have shown that all high - mass ysos associated with ionized jets are also associated with large scale , high velocity collimated molecular outflows , and that there exists a correlation between the radio luminosity , and the momentum rate of the molecular outflows ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath102ghz radio luminosity of g11p1 is relatively large with s@xmath103d@xmath104 mjy@xmath0kpc@xmath105 , near the lower range of what is observed for jets from massive protostars @xcite , but much larger than radio luminosities from low mass stars . in section  [ rad_cont ]",
    "we have estimated mass loss and momentum rates for the jet in g11p1 .",
    "the resulting values are lower than what is found for jets from massive protostars like iras@xmath016547@xmath24247 @xcite , or iras@xmath016562@xmath23959 @xcite , but there are still many uncertain assumptions made in the estimate of these quantities . furthermore , these sources are much more luminous than g11p1 , and we can speculate that the lower values for mass loss and momentum rates are due to the earlier evolutionary state of the protostar in g11p1 .",
    "if we assume that the molecular flow observed by @xcite is related to the radio luminosity , we find that the jet / flow data of g11p1 fall close to the radio luminosity / momentum rate relation of @xcite .",
    "previous observations have established the stellar source in the g11p1 core as a new candidate for a massive protostar in a very early evolutionary stage .",
    "the upgraded vla provides the high sensitivity to detect these types of very early massive protostars in the radio continuum down to a rms of few @xmath12jy / beam .",
    "our vla continuum observations reveal four weak , and unresolved sources , centered on the mid - ir source , which are aligned in a ne - sw direction .",
    "the spectral indices determined for each component are consistent with partially optically thick ( @xmath106 ) free - free emission from ionized gas arising from a thermal jet @xcite , where the mechanism of ionization is most likely by shock ionization .",
    "we also present archival nir data from ukirt ( resolution of @xmath107 ) .",
    "these data reveal an extended structure only visible in k - band , which is oriented perpendicular to the orientation of the radio continuum data .",
    "this structure can be interpreted as scattered light from an accretion disk .",
    "our observations thus provide new evidence that a disk / jet system is present in the protostar in g11p1 .",
