    "in the past years , the observations of a number of charmonium - like `` @xmath18 '' mesons at @xmath19 factories have stimulated the interest in the spectroscopy of the charmonium states again .",
    "there is growing evidence that at least some of these new states are non - conventional @xmath20 states , such as deuteron like hadronic molecules , tetraquark states or hybrid have been suggested @xcite . among these new mesons ,",
    "some are very close to the threshold of two charmed mesons , such as @xmath21 @xcite and @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "this distinctive character inspires the molecular interpretation for these mesons .",
    "in particular , some new enhancements near the @xmath0 threshold have been observed recently .",
    "the belle collaboration reported a broad @xmath23 peak near 4008 mev in addition to the well - known state @xmath24 by studying the initial state radiation process @xmath25 @xcite , its mass and width are fitted to be @xmath26 mev and @xmath27 mev respectively .",
    "we notice its width is huge .",
    "this peak was suggested to be related to the @xmath0 threshold and could be a @xmath0 molecule in ref .",
    "the @xmath23 spectrum was studied further by the babar collaboration .",
    "however , there was no evidence for this broad enhancement , and the an upper limit @xmath28 at @xmath29 c.l .",
    "was obtained @xcite .",
    "@xmath16 is far from being established so far , more experimental efforts are obviously needed .    of special importance is the observation of the state carrying non - zero electric charge with hidden charm quarks . since the observation of @xmath22 @xcite , the belle collaboration reported two resonance - like structures @xmath15 and @xmath30 in the @xmath31 mass distribution in the exclusive process @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "their masses and widths are determined to be @xmath33 mev , @xmath34 mev , @xmath35 mev and @xmath36 mev respectively .",
    "since @xmath37 is an isovector with negative g - parity , and @xmath38 is a isospin singlet with positive g - parity , the quantum numbers of both z@xmath39(4051 ) and z@xmath40(4250 ) are @xmath41 . in ref.@xcite",
    ", @xmath15 was suggested to be possibly a @xmath42 @xmath0 molecule due to its closeness to the @xmath0 threshold .",
    "however , the qcd sum rule results indicated that the @xmath43 state is probably a virtual state , which is not related with the @xmath15 resonance - like structure @xcite .",
    "in addition , we demonstrated that @xmath30 as a @xmath44 or @xmath45 molecule is disfavored in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since the repulsive kinetic energy is greatly reduced by the heavy quark mass , the interaction between light quarks is strong enough so that the molecular states consisting of heavy flavor mesons very likely exist .",
    "in fact , the hadronic molecules consisting of two charm mesons were suggested long ago @xcite",
    ". de rujula , georgi and glashow proposed that the molecular states involving hidden @xmath20 pair do exist , and have a rich spectrum @xcite .",
    "possible new resonance near the @xmath0 threshold was suggested by voloshin @xcite .",
    "different from other possible exotic structures , there are uncontroversial evidences for hadronic molecule such as the deuteron , which is unambiguously a proton - neutron bound state .",
    "the deuteron has been studied in great details over the years @xcite . from these studies , we learn that the pion exchange determines most of the binding energy and the long range part of the deuteron wavefunction , and the s - d wave mixing effect plays a critical role in providing the binding . guided by the binding of deuteron ,",
    "tornqvist performed a systematic study of possible deuteronlike two mesons bound states with long distance one pion exchange @xcite . at short distance , the interaction should be induced by the interactions among the quarks . however , a detailed and reliable modelling of the short range interaction is not a easy matter , and various phenomenological models have been proposed @xcite , although one pion exchange is expected to be dominant for the hadronic molecule .",
    "inspired by the nucleon - nucleon interactions , we further extended the one pion exchange model to include the short distance contributions from the heavier bosons @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 exchanges in ref .",
    "we have also taken into account the contribution of the `` @xmath46 function '' term , which leads to a @xmath46 function term in the effective potential in configuration space when no regularization is used .",
    "this one boson exchange model gives a very good description of the weakly bound hadronic molecule .",
    "it has been successfully applied to exploring the possible heavy flavor pseudoscalar - vector molecular states @xcite , the @xmath47 system and the molecular interpretation of @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "motivated by the controversial states @xmath16 and @xmath15 , we shall examine for which quantum numbers the boson exchange potential is attractive and strong enough so that bound states are expected , ten allowed @xmath0 states with low spin parity are considered .",
    "moreover , the @xmath1 system would be discussed as well .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the formalism of one boson exchange model is summarized . in section iii",
    ", we apply the one boson exchange model to the @xmath0 system , the quantum numbers of the @xmath0 bound states which might exist , are suggested .",
    "the @xmath1 system is discussed along the same line in section iv .",
    "finally we present our conclusions and some discussions in section v.",
    "in the one boson exchange model , the effective potential between two hadrons is obtained by summing the interactions between light quarks or antiquarks via one boson exchange . to leading order in the boson fields and their derivative , the effective interactions between the constituent quark and the exchanged boson are",
    "as follows @xcite @xmath49 here @xmath50 is the constituent quark mass , @xmath51 is the constituent quark dirac spinor field , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are isospin - singlet pseudoscalar , scalar and vector boson fields respectively . in this work",
    "we take @xmath55 mev , since we concentrate on the constituent up and down quarks here .",
    "if the isovector bosons are involved , the couplings enter in the form @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively , where @xmath59 is the well - known pauli matrices . following standard procedure ,",
    "we can straightforwardly obtain the one boson exchange potential between two quarks .",
    "1 .   pseudoscalar boson exchange @xmath60\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the tensor operator .",
    "we have defined @xmath62 to approximately account for the recoil effect due to the small mass splitting within the heavy flavor vector meson isospin multiplet @xcite , where @xmath63 is the exchanged pseudoscalar mass , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the masses of the heavy flavor vector mesons involved . for the @xmath1 system , the mass splitting can be negligible so that @xmath66 is satisfied .",
    "scalar boson exchange @xmath67\\ ] ] where @xmath68 , @xmath69 with @xmath70 being the exchanged scalar meson mass , and @xmath71 is the angular momentum operator .",
    "vector boson exchange @xmath72\\\\ \\label{4}&&-(3g^2_{vqq}+4g_{vqq}f_{vqq})\\frac{\\mu^2_{v}}{2m^2_q}h_2(\\lambda , m_v,\\mu_v , r)\\mathbf{l}\\cdot\\mathbf{s}_{ij}\\bigg\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 approximately reflects the recoil effect with @xmath74 being the exchanged vector meson mass . for @xmath14 isovector boson exchange , the above three potentials in eq.([2])-eq.([4 ] ) should be multiplied by the operator @xmath75 in the isospin space .",
    "the dimensionless functions @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 introduced in eq.([2])-eq.([4 ] ) are defined as follows @xmath80 with @xmath81 . in deriving",
    "the above effective potentials , we have introduced form factor at each interaction vertex to regularize the effective potential at short distance , and the form factor in momentum space is taken as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the so - called regularization parameter , @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the mass and the four momentum of the exchanged boson respectively .",
    "this form factor suppresses the contribution of high momentum , i.e. small distance .",
    "the presence of such a form factor is dictated by the extended structure of the hadrons .",
    "the parameter @xmath83 , which governs the range of suppression , can be directly related to the hadron size which is approximately proportional to @xmath86 . however , since the question of hadron size is still very much open , the value of @xmath83 is poorly known phenomenologically , and it is dependent on the models and applications . in the nucleon - nucleon interactions ,",
    "the @xmath83 in the range of 0.8 - 1.5 gev has been used to fit the data .",
    "for the present application to the heavy flavor vector mesons system , which have a smaller size than the nucleon , we would expect a larger regularization parameter @xmath83 .",
    "we have demonstrated that the binding energy and static properties of the deuteron are produced very well in the one boson exchange model , if @xmath83 is chosen to be about 808 mev @xcite . in the case that all coupling constants except @xmath87 are reduced by half , @xmath83 should be approximately @xmath88 mev .",
    "the extended structure of hadrons also has the following obvious consequence : because the mass of the exchanged meson determines the range of the corresponding contribution to the @xmath0 interactions , one should restrict oneself to meson exchange with the exchanged meson mass below a certain value , typically on the order of the regularization parameter @xmath83 .",
    "since @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 exchanges are considered in the present work , the value of @xmath83 should be larger than the @xmath6 meson mass .    in the present one boson exchange model ,",
    "the input parameters include the masses of the exchanged bosons and heavy flavor vector mesons , and the effective coupling constants between the constituent quarks and the exchanged bosons .",
    "the meson masses are taken from the compilation of the particle data group @xcite : @xmath89 mev , @xmath90 mev , @xmath91 mev , @xmath92 mev , @xmath93 mev , @xmath94 mev , @xmath95 mev , @xmath96 mev and @xmath97 mev .",
    "the constituent quark - meson coupling constants can be estimated from the phenomenologically known @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 coupling constants via the well - known goldberger - treiman relation @xcite .",
    "@xmath103 among the above effective boson - nucleon coupling constants , only @xmath87 has been determined accurately from the pion - nucleon and nucleon - nucleon scatterings . as in our previous work @xcite ,",
    "the effective coupling constants are taken from the famous bonn model @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty of the coupling constants will be taken into account later , all the coupling constants except @xmath87 are reduced by half for demonstration , and the corresponding numerical results are presented as well .    for the system consisting of two vector mesons ,",
    "the spatial parity is determined by @xmath104 and the @xmath105 parity is @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the relative angular momentum between two vector mesons , and @xmath108 is the total spin of the system .",
    "we cutoff the total angular momentum of the system to @xmath109 , the allowed states with low spin parity are listed in table [ states ] . in the following ,",
    "we shall study for which quantum numbers the one boson exchange potential is so attractive that bound states may exist .",
    ".[states]the allowed states of the system consisting of two vector mesons , where only states whose total angular momentum is smaller than 3 are listed . [ cols=\"^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     following the same methhod as the @xmath0 case and carefully examining the numerical results , we suggest that the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xmath1 molecules should exist , and the @xmath110 @xmath1 bound state also very likely exists .",
    "similar to the @xmath7 @xmath0 state , the @xmath7 @xmath1 molecule can be produced largely in @xmath17 annihilation at babar or belle .",
    "detailed scanning of the @xmath17 annihilation data at the @xmath1 threshold is expected .",
    "motivated by the charmonium - like state @xmath16 and @xmath15 , the possible @xmath0 molecular states have been studied dynamically in the one boson exchange model , where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 exchanges are taken into account .",
    "ten allowed states with low spin parity have been considered .",
    "we find that the binding energy and static properties are sensitive to the regularization parameter @xmath83 and the effective coupling constants .",
    "the binding energy increases with @xmath83 , whereas the root of mean square radius decreases with @xmath83 , this is because increasing @xmath83 increases the strength of the potential at short distance .",
    "larger coupling constants are favorable to the formation of molecular states .",
    "if all the coupling constants except @xmath87 are reduced by half , larger value of @xmath83 is required to find bound state solutions .",
    "isospin violation is expected , especially for the states close to the threshold , and the @xmath13 component is dominant , the predominance of the @xmath13 configuration over @xmath14 can be clearly understood in the exact isospin symmetry limit , and the same conclusion is reached in the one pion exchange model . hence the interpretation of @xmath15 as a @xmath0 molecule is not favored .    since the regularization parameter @xmath83 is poorly known so far , we are not be able to precisely predict the binding energies for the possible molecular states bound by one boson exchange potential .",
    "certainly , if the potential is strong enough one can be quite confident that such bound state must exist , but their exact binding energy always depends on the details of the regularization procedure .",
    "however , we can reliably predict which ones of the ten allowed states are much easier to be bound , and the prediction is rather stable even if the uncertainty of the coupling constants is considered , as is obvious from the numerical results in appendix [ charm_result ] .",
    "further research on x(3872 ) would put severe constraint on the parameters on the one boson exchange model , especially on the regularization parameter @xmath83 , so that the predictions presented in the work could become more precise .",
    "our detailed numerical results indicate that the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xmath0 bound states should very likely exist , whereas the cp exotic @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xmath0 states , @xmath111 and @xmath112 @xmath0 states may not be bound by the one boson exchange potential .",
    "the @xmath7 state can be directly produced in @xmath17 annihilation , detailed @xmath17 annihilation data near the @xmath0 threshold are important to confirm or refute the existence of such state .",
    "the @xmath0 molecule mainly decays into @xmath113 and @xmath114 via the dissociation of @xmath115 and @xmath116 , the @xmath117 mode is highly suppressed or forbidden by the phase space , and its width should be about tens of mev . although @xmath16 is close to the @xmath0 threshold , its width is huge so that it is unreasonable to identify @xmath16 as a @xmath0 molecule .",
    "the existence of @xmath16 and @xmath15 has not been confirmed so far , more experimental efforts are urgently needed .",
    "the possible @xmath1 molecular states have been discussed along the same line .",
    "the @xmath1 system is more deeply bound than the @xmath0 system .",
    "we find that the molecular states of the @xmath1 system have definite isospin , and the isospin singlet is much easier to be bound than the isospin vector for the states considered , the reason is analyzed in the isospin symmetry limit . if the small isospin mass splitting between the neutral and charged pion mesons is neglected , the dimension of the coupled channel problem is reduced by half , the situation is simplified greatly .",
    "it is observed that including the pion mass splitting modifies the binding energy by at most 0.5 mev .",
    "we suggest that the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xmath1 molecules should exist , they would be narrow states , and they dominantly decay into @xmath118 .",
