    "since first proposed by watts and strogatz @xcite in 1998 , the watts - strogatz ( ws ) small world model has been widely and deeply studied . in ws model ,",
    "vertices are placed on a ring with each vertex having a finite number of @xmath5 nearest regular connections initially .",
    "the connections are then rewired with a probability @xmath6 to form long - range connections or short paths . by varying the single parameter @xmath6 from @xmath7 to @xmath8 , ws model displays phase transition from a regular network to a small world , which ends up with a random network at @xmath9 . considering that the rewiring of connections may cause isolated vertices , the addition - type ws model - newman and watts ( nw )",
    "model @xcite was proposed later , in which long - range connections are added with a probability @xmath10 while keeping the initial regular connections unchanged .",
    "nw model and ws model are nearly equivalent , especially when the network size @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "marcelo kuperman and guillermo aberamson generalized ws model in @xcite . in their model , besides connecting with the two nearest neighboring vertices , with a probability @xmath10 each of the vertices in the model chooses a non - neighboring vertex to construct a long - range connection between them .",
    "the choice of the non - neighboring vertex is governed by the distance - dependent probability distribution :    @xmath12    when @xmath13 , the nw model is restored . through varying the value of @xmath2 , the global correlation of the network is influenced . by analyzing the topological characteristic of the network , it was observed that the network also shows a small world nature , and the network converges to a regular lattice as @xmath14 @xcite .    to analyze the behavior of a small world network from the point of view of statistical physics , researchers focus on its long - range connections or short - paths , which may lead to global coherence . in networks without any short - path , the transmission of information has to pass a long distance @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the network size ) , so global coherence is difficult to reach . with the increase of the number of short - paths , or long - range connections ,",
    "collective behavior will emerge in the system .",
    "this global coherence and the ubiquitous small world phenomenon in real - life make the study of thermodynamic phase transition on networks with small world property significantly popular @xcite , in which ising model is one of the most fascinating points .    as a comparatively simple but very important model of statistical physics",
    ", ising model perfectly shows order - disorder transition of the system .",
    "ising model on one - dimensional regular lattice does not show phase transition at any finite - temperature and the phase transition on multi - dimensional regular lattice is not of mean - field nature .",
    "that the ising model undergoes phase transitions in the addition - type ws model has been studied in @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that in the small world phase the addition - type ws model has a mean - field nature @xcite .",
    "the critical behavior of the ising model on one - dimensional network with distance - dependent connections given by eq.(1 ) is expected to reflect the nature of the network at different values of @xmath2 indirectly @xcite .",
    "but it remains controversial about the mean - field nature of the phase transition in the range of @xmath17 @xcite .    to detect whether a network has a small world behavior , one can calculate the average shortest - path length and the average clustering coefficient .",
    "sen and charkrabarti in @xcite and moukarzel and de menezes in @xcite obtained the contradictory results by analyzing the topological structure of networks with connection probability at distance @xmath18 given by eq.(1 ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was found that the average shortest - path length behaves as @xmath19 on rings of size @xmath16 for all @xmath20 , hence it was concluded that small world behavior occurs for @xmath4 while in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was argued that small world behavior occurs only for @xmath21 . in the section @xmath22 , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the average shortest - path length scales as @xmath23 with the value of the exponent @xmath24 @xmath25 depending on @xmath2 . ref .",
    "@xcite studied the critical behavior of ising model on such a one - dimensional network , since if the network s behavior is that of small world it should be reflected in the critical exponents of the ising model , which will assume mean - field values .",
    "their result indicates that there is a mean - field behavior for @xmath21 and a finite - dimensional behavior for @xmath22 , which is in accordance with the conclusion in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we re - examine the critical behavior of ising model on a one - dimensional network with distance - dependent connections in ref .",
    "@xcite by using monte carlo simulations .",
    "but we enlarge the underlying network sizes , and also take into account the finite - size scaling analysis of the order parameter @xmath26 $ ] by using the plot of @xmath3n^{1/4}$ ] versus @xmath27 , which can reflect the mean - field nature indirectly @xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath28 $ ] and @xmath29 denote the thermal average taken over monte carlo steps for equilibrium at each temperature , and over different network realizations , respectively .",
    "thus more reliable results can be produced from our simulations , since statistical fluctuations are greatly suppressed in these large - scale networks , and the finite - size effects are much more discernible in the binder s cumulant @xmath30 @xcite and the specific heat @xmath31 than in the order parameter @xmath3 $ ] @xcite .",
    "the results show that the model has a mean - field nature in the whole range of @xmath4 .    in the next section",
    ", we will introduce the model we use and the monte carlo simulation . in section ,",
    "the results and analysis are given .",
    "section is the conclusion .",
    "the underlying network of the one - dimensional ising model used in this paper is based on the generalized ws model @xcite .",
    "the addition of connections considers the distance between vertices .",
    "that means the vertex @xmath32 to which a connection is attached is not randomly selected , but according to a distribution depending on the distance @xmath18 from @xmath33 to @xmath32 : @xmath1 .",
    "we start with a one - dimensional regular lattice with @xmath34 vertices and @xmath35 nearest neighbors . from @xmath36 , we select the @xmath33-th vertex and generate a random number @xmath37 from a uniform distribution . if @xmath38 , we select one vertex from the clockwise @xmath39 vertices to attach to according to the probability distribution @xmath40 .",
    "self - connections and multiple connections are prohibited .",
    "we repeat this process until all the vertices are selected , which results in a network with @xmath41 connections on average .    in order to investigate the influence of @xmath2 on the critical behavior of ising model , in this paper we only consider the case @xmath42 for simplicity .",
    "our model with @xmath13 is equivalent to the model used by andrzej pekalski @xcite .",
    "as @xmath43 , our model restores to the one - dimensional regular network with @xmath44 nearest neighbors .",
    "fig.1 shows that with the increase of @xmath2 , long - range connections are more and more difficult to form between vertices with long distances .     with the size of the network @xmath16 under different @xmath2 values (",
    "the case @xmath45 is almost identical with @xmath13 ) .",
    "all the plots have been averaged over 50 realizations.,width=226 ]    fig.2 shows that the increase of @xmath2 results in the increase of the average shortest - path length @xmath46 , but the small world property retains within the entire range @xmath4 as @xmath47 .",
    "fig.3(a ) shows that with the increase of @xmath2 value , especially after @xmath48 , the network clustering coefficient becomes independent of system size , which is the characteristic of regular network .",
    "furthermore , it can be seen from fig.3(b ) that , for a certain network size , with the increase of @xmath2 , the clustering coefficient converges to @xmath49 , which is identical to the clustering coefficient of one - dimensional regular network with @xmath44 nearest neighbors .     versus network size @xmath16 for different @xmath2 values .",

    "our monte carlo simulation of the ising model starts on a periodic one - dimensional ring . at the beginning , all the spins on the ring are given the same value @xmath55 , then a random vertex is selected to flip according to the rule of the metropolis algorithm @xcite and glauber dynamics @xcite to simulate the evolution of ising model under different temperature . and",
