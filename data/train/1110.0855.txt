    "piecewise - smooth dynamical systems are commonly used in nonlinear dynamics and control to model devices of interest and/or synthesize discontinuous control actions e.g. , @xcite , @xcite . despite the large number of available results on their well - posedness and stability , there are few papers in the literature where the problem of assessing their incremental stability and convergence properties is discussed",
    ".    the available results usually refer to specific classes of systems and rely on ad hoc continuity assumptions . for example",
    ", the problem of proving convergence for piecewise affine continuous systems and networks is addressed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite using a lyapunov based approach .",
    "the methodology extends the approach of demidovich for smooth dynamical systems expounded in @xcite .",
    "contraction theory is an alternative approach used to study convergence between trajectories in smooth dynamical systems ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the contraction approach is based on finding some metric under which the matrix measure of the system jacobian can be proved to be definite negative over some convex set of phase space of interest .",
    "it can be shown that demidovich approach is related to proving contraction using euclidean norms and matrix measures .",
    "nevertheless , using contraction it suffices to find some measure to study the jacobian properties including non - euclidean ones ( e.g. , @xmath0 , @xmath1 etc ) .",
    "contraction theory has been used in a wide range of applications .",
    "for example , it has been shown that contraction is an extremely useful property to analyze coordination problems in networked control systems such as the emergence of synchronization or consensus ( @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , all trajectories of a contracting system can be shown to exponentially converge towards each other asymptotically .",
    "therefore as shown in @xcite , this property can be effectively exploited to give conditions for the synchronization of a network of dynamical systems of interest .",
    "recently , it has also been shown that the use of non euclidean matrix measures can be used to construct an algorithmic approach to prove contraction @xcite and to prove efficiently convergence in biological networks @xcite .",
    "historically , ideas closely related to contraction can be traced back to  @xcite and even to  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ,  @xcite , and e.g.  @xcite , @xcite for a more exhaustive list of related references ) . for autonomous systems and with constant metrics ,",
    "the basic nonlinear contraction result reduces to krasovskii s theorem ( @xcite ) in the continous - time case , and to the contraction mapping theorem in the discrete - time case ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    despite the usefulness of contraction theory in applications",
    ", there is no consistent extension of this approach to the large class of piecewise smooth and switched dynamical systems . in @xcite , it is conjectured that , for certain classes of piecewise - smooth systems , contraction of each individual mode is sufficient to guarantee convergence of all the system trajectories towards each other , i.e. contraction of the overall system of interest .",
    "also , in @xcite , it is noted that contraction theory can be extended to a class of hybrid systems under certain assumptions on the properties of the reset maps and switching signals .",
    "the aim of this paper is to start addressing systematically the extension of contraction theory to generic classes of switched systems . here",
    ", we focus on two types of switched systems of relevance in applications : ( i ) piecewise - smooth continuous ( pwsc ) systems ( a class of state - dependent switched systems ) , and ( ii ) time - dependent switched systems ( tss ) .",
    "the goal is to obtain a set of sufficient conditions guaranteeing global exponential convergence of their trajectories .",
    "the extension of contraction theory to filippov vector fields will be presented in a separate paper currently in preparation .    from a methodological viewpoint , to investigate contraction properties of pwsc and tss we focus on systems whose vector fields satisfy caratheodory conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an absolutely continuous solution ( see @xcite and @xcite for further details ) .",
    "we prove that , as conjectured in @xcite , for this class of systems , contraction of each individual mode suffices to guarantee convergence of all the system trajectories towards each other , i.e. contraction of the overall system of interest .",
    "contrary to the results presented in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , we do not require finding incremental lyapunov functions for the system of interest .",
    "we use instead , as commonly done for analysing contraction in smooth systems , a generic condition on the existence of some metric in which the jacobian of each mode of the system of interest is definite negative .",
    "we then apply the theoretical results to study convergence of some representative examples , including a network of time - switched systems .",
    "a preliminary version of some of the results presented in this paper were presented at the @xmath2 ifac world congress in milan in september 2011  @xcite .",
    "before presenting the main results of the paper , we introduce here some essential definitions and notation that will be used in the rest of the paper .",
    "let @xmath3 be an @xmath4-dimensional vector .",
    "we denote with @xmath5 the norm of the vector .",
    "let @xmath6 be a ( real ) matrix .",
    "then , @xmath7 denotes the norm of @xmath6 .",
    "we recall ( see for instance  @xcite ) that , given a vector norm on euclidean space ( @xmath8 ) , with its induced matrix norm @xmath7 , the associated _ matrix measure _",
    "@xmath9 is defined as the directional derivative of the matrix norm , that is , @xmath10 for example , if @xmath8 is the standard euclidean 2-norm , then @xmath11 is the maximum eigenvalue of the symmetric part of @xmath6 .",
    "as we shall see , however , different norms will be useful for our applications .",
    "matrix measures are also known as `` _ _ logarithmic norms _ _ '' , a concept independently introduced by germund dahlquist and sergei lozinskii in 1959 , @xcite .",
    "the limit is known to exist , and the convergence is monotonic , see  @xcite .    in what follows",
    "we report the analytic expression of some matrix measures used in the paper :    * @xmath12 ; * @xmath13 ; * @xmath14    more generally , we will also make use of matrix measures induced by weighted vector norms , say @xmath15 , with @xmath16 a constant invertible matrix and @xmath17 .",
    "such measures , denoted with @xmath18 , can be computed by using the following property : @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "obviously , any other measure can be used .",
    "we will also use the following definitions .",
    "[ defn : k - reachable ] let @xmath21 be any positive real number .",
    "a subset @xmath22 is _",
    "@xmath23-reachable _ if , for any two points @xmath24 and @xmath25 in @xmath26 there is some continuously differentiable curve @xmath27 \\rightarrow c$ ] such that :    1 .",
    "@xmath28 , 2 .",
    "@xmath29 and 3 .",
    "@xmath30 , @xmath31 .    for convex sets @xmath26 , we may pick @xmath32 , so @xmath33 and we can take @xmath34 .",
    "thus , convex sets are @xmath35-reachable , and it is easy to show that the converse holds as well .    given a dynamical system @xmath36    we define its flow @xmath37 as the operator ( see @xcite for a definition ) such that    @xmath38    in applications of the theory , it is often the case that @xmath39 will be a closed set , for example delimited by some hyperplane in the phase space , which could e.g. model constraints on the state variables of the system .",
    "we remark here that for a non - open set , differentiability in @xmath3 means that the vector field @xmath40 can be extended as a differentiable function to some open set which includes @xmath39 , and any continuity hypotheses with respect to @xmath41 hold on this open set .",
    "we give the following preliminary definitions :    a function @xmath42 \\rightarrow { { \\mathbb r}}^{n}$ ] is said to be measurable if , for any real number @xmath43 , the set @xmath44 :   g(t)>\\alpha\\}$ ] is measurable in the sense of lebesgue .    a function @xmath45",
    "\\rightarrow { { \\mathbb r}}$ ] is summable if the lebesgue integral of the absolute value of @xmath46 exists and is finite .",
    "a function @xmath47 \\rightarrow { { \\mathbb r}}^{n}$ ] is absolutely continuous if for all @xmath48 there exists @xmath49 such that for each finite collection @xmath50 \\ldots [ a_{n},b_{n}]$ ] of disjoint sets in @xmath51 $ ] , it holds that @xmath52 .",
    "now we are able to give the definition of a caratheodory solution of a differential equation ( see also @xcite and references therein ) :    let us consider a domain @xmath53 and a dynamical system of the form : @xmath54    where @xmath55 . a caratheodory solution for this system",
    "is an absolutely continuous function @xmath56 that satisfies ( [ eqn : pws_nl ] ) for almost all @xmath57 $ ] ( in the sense of lesbesgue ) , where @xmath58 $ ] is an interval where the solution @xmath56 is defined .",
    "that is , a caratheodory solution of ( [ eqn : pws_nl ] ) is an absolutely continuous function @xmath56 such that :    @xmath59.\\ ] ]    in the common cases where the solution @xmath56 can be extended forward in time , the same definition holds for each @xmath60 .",
    "an useful result provides sufficient conditions for the existence of a caratheodory solution of the system ( [ eqn : pws_nl ] ) .",
    "[ thm : caratheodory ] a caratheodory solution of system ( [ eqn : pws_nl ] ) exists if :    1 .   for",

    "notice that , as discussed in @xcite , p. 10 and proved in @xcite , equations that satisfy the above ( caratheodory ) conditions and those required for the uniqueness of a solution show continuous dependence on initial conditions .",
    "following @xcite p.73 , we define a piecewise smooth dynamical system as follows .",
    "[ def : pws ] given a finite collection of disjoint , open and non empty sets @xmath73 such that @xmath74 is a connected set , a dynamical system @xmath75 is called a _",

    "we now introduce two important classes of switched systems that will be analyzed in the paper and for which a caratheodory solution exists .",

    "we now give the definition of a time - dependent switching system according to @xcite .",
    "a _ time - dependent switching system _ is a dynamical system of the form @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a piecewise continuous time - dependent switching signal taking one over @xmath91 finite possible values .",
    "note that according to this definition , we are excluding the case where infinite switchings occur over finite time so that zeno behavior can not occur ( see @xcite for further details )",
    ".    we will refer to _ caratheodory systems _ to indicate any pws or tss satisfying the conditions for the existence of a caratheodory solution given in theorem  [ thm : caratheodory ] .",
    "in this section , the notion of contraction is briefly summarized for a generic nonlinear system of the form : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is an @xmath94-dimensional vector field assumed to be sufficiently _ smooth_.

    "the next step is to show that the solution @xmath141 of ( [ eq : dinamica_w ] ) is a continuous function for any fixed @xmath127 $ ] .",
    "indeed , without loss of generality , consider the image of the curve @xmath130 under the action of the flow @xmath142 for a time @xmath143 such that the system trajectory rooted in @xmath130 has either crossed the boundary once or it has not ( in the case there are multiple switchings between @xmath144 and @xmath143 , the same reasoning can be iterated ) .",
    "furthermore , let us call @xmath145t_0 , t[$ ] the time instant at which the trajectory eventually crosses the boundary .",
    "suppose , without loss of generality , that at @xmath146 , the flow switches from region @xmath147 to region @xmath148 .",

    "thus , the sufficient conditions derived in this paper can be useful for the analysis of incremental stability in switched systems and the design of stabilizing switched control inputs .",
    "* the results reported so far do not include the case of differential equations with discontinuous right - hand side or filippov systems where so - called sliding motion is possible @xcite .",
    "this is ongoing work that will be reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "in the previous section , contraction theory was extended to piecewise continuous and time - dependent systems . in both cases",
    ", we were able to show that the contraction still implies asymptotic convergence between trajectories . often in applications , it is desirable to prove ( or certify ) that , at steady state , all trajectories of a given system exhibit some property regardless of their initial conditions .    in the case of smooth dynamical systems ,",
    "the concept of partial contraction was introduced in @xcite to solve this problem .",
    "the idea is to introduce an appropriately constructed auxiliary or _ virtual system _ , embedding the solutions of the system of interest as its particular solutions .",
    "if the virtual system is proved to be contracting , then all of its solutions will converge towards a unique trajectory . in turn , this imples that all trajectories of the system of interest , embedded in the virtual system by construction , will also converge towards this solution .",
    "the most notable application of partial contration is its use to prove convergence of trajectories of all nodes of a network of dynamical systems towards each other as for example is required in synchronization or coordination problems . in that case , the virtual system is constructed so that trajectories of the network nodes are its particular solutions .",
    "proving contraction of the virtual system then implies convergence of all node trajectories towards the same synchronous evolution ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for further details and applications ) .    using the extension of contraction to switched caratheodory systems presented in this paper",
    ", we can also extend partial contraction to this class of systems .",

    "now , since ( [ eqn : virtual_system ] ) is contracting , then all of its solutions will converge towards @xmath208 .",
    "this in turn implies that @xmath213 as @xmath214 .",
    "we remark here that theorem [ theorem : partial_contraction ] allows to prove that all the solutions of the real system of interest converge , at steady state , towards a unique solution even if it is not contracting .",
    "the key point of such a result is indeed that of constructing a contracting system which embeds the solutions of the real system .",
    "the main implication of this is that trajectories of the real system will converge towards each other but convergence will not be exponential and , in general , it may be non - uniform .",
    "that is , theorem [ theorem : partial_contraction ] only ensures that , after a sufficiently long time , distances between all the solutions of ( [ eq : pwsc_esteso ] ) shrink . in some special case ,",
    "see e.g. @xcite , the dimensionality of the virtual system is lower than that of the real system of interest : this is typically the case of systems with symmetries , such as _ quorum sensing _ networks .",
