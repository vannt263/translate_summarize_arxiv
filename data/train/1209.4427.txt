    "recent observations of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) with the space missions such as _ swift _ and _ fermi _ have greatly enriched our knowledge of this phenomenon .",
    "these new data place important constraints on the grb central engine models . in general",
    ", a grb central engine should meet the following criteria : ( 1 ) it must be able to power a very powerful outflow with isotropic luminosity at least that of the gamma - ray luminosity , i.e. @xmath2 ( e.g. zhang & mszros 2004 ) .",
    "( 2 ) the jet must contain a small baryon contamination , so that the it can reach a high lorentz factor , typically @xmath3 ( e.g. lithwick & sari 2001 ) .",
    "( 3 ) the central engine must be intermittent to power rapid variability as observed in many grbs ( e.g. fishman & meagan 1995 ) .",
    "( 4 ) since a good fraction of grbs are followed by erratic x - ray flares , the grb central engine must be long - lived and can power delayed activities ( e.g. burrows et al . 2005 ; zhang et al .",
    "( 5 ) in some grbs ( e.g. grb 080916c ) , the broad - band spectra show no evidence of quasi - thermal emission from a fireball photosphere ( abdo et al .",
    "2009 ) , suggesting that at least for some grbs , the central engine has to be strongly magnetized ( e.g. zhang & peer 2009 ) .",
    "the leading model of grb central engine is a stellar - mass black hole ( hereafter bh ) surrounded by a neutrino - cooling - dominated accretion flow ( hereafter ndaf ) with an extremely high accretion rate ( e.g. @xmath4/s ) .",
    "there are two main energy reservoirs to provide the jet power : the accretion energy in the disk that is carried by neutrinos and anti - neutrinos , which annihilate and power a bipolar outflow ; and the spin energy of the black hole which can be tapped by a magnetic field connecting the outer world through the blandford - znajek ( 1977 , hereafter bz ) mechanism .",
    "both models have been extensively investigated by many authors ( e.g. , popham et al .",
    "1999 ; lee et al .",

    "some questions remain open : for example , which mechanism plays a more dominant role in jet power ?",
    "do they dominate in different luminosity regimes ?",
    "can one differentiate these different mechanisms using observational data ?    in view of the recent observational constraints , we plan to systematically investigate the grb bh central engine models in detail .",
    "the results are presented in two papers . in this first paper",
    ", we address a fundamental problem of grb central engine : the baryon loading in the jet .",
    "all grb prompt emission models rely on an assumed value of bulk lorentz factor @xmath5 .",
    "recent broad band observations have led to measurement of @xmath5 for a good sample of grbs , and interesting correlations between @xmath5 and the isotropic @xmath6-ray energy and luminosity , i.e. @xmath7 with @xmath8 , have been discovered ( liang et al .",
    "2010 ; l et al . 2012",
    "ghirlanda et al . 2012 ) .",
    "most @xmath5 values were measured using the peak of the early afterglow light curve , which is believed to be related to the onset of the self - similar deceleration phase ( e , g .",
    "sari & piran 1999 ) .",
    "this time is defined by the total energy in the ejecta and the density of the ambient medium , and essentially does not depend on the composition of the jet correlation . ] .",
    "the obtained correlation slope therefore does not pend on the jet power supply mechanisms .",
    "it is therefore interesting to investigate whether such a correlation roots from the fundamental physics of grb baryon loading .",
    "this is the task of this paper . in the companion paper",
    ", we will investigate how the two jet mechanisms confront with the data of prompt grb emission and early x - ray afterglow .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we calculate the neutrino - annihilation power and minimum baryon loading from a neutrino driven wind from a hyper - accreting bh disk . the role of magnetic field is ignored . by considering a range of bh spin , we simulate 2000 grbs for their neutrino - annihilation jet energy ( which is a proxy of the isotropic @xmath6-ray energy ) and the maximum lorentz factor ( defined by the minimum baryon loading ) . in section 3 , we consider a strongly magnetized bz jet launched from the central bh .",
    "we consider baryon loading into the magnetically dominated jet by the pickup neutron mechanism .",
    "free neutrons can penetrate magnetic field lines and drift into the jet region . through positron",
    "capture and proton - neutron collision avalanche , the neutrons are converted to protons and loaded in the jet .",
    "our results are summarized in section 4 with some discussion .",
    "the bh central engine model with a superaccreting disk has been studied extensively ( e.g. , popham et al . 1999 ; narayan et al . 2001 ; di matteo et al . 2002 ; kohri & mineshige 2002 ; gu et al .",

    "( 2012 ) ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "we note that the insensitive @xmath116 on @xmath98 is crucial to the above argument .",
    "we d like to caution that despite of the correct power law index of the correlation , the absolute values of @xmath86 ( and hence , @xmath5 ) is typically a little bit too low . inspecting fig.[fig1 ]",
    ", one can see that for @xmath124 , the lorentz factor @xmath5 is @xmath125 . in order to reach large @xmath5 values",
    ", one needs to appeal to model parameters that invoke large spin and high accretion rate .",
    "another possibility to reconcile with the data is to assume a relatively small @xmath108 , so that for an observed @xmath126 , the corresponding @xmath127 is much larger , which corresponds to a higher @xmath5 to be consistent with the data .",
    "with magnetic field lines threading the horizon of a kerr black hole , the rotational energy of the black hole can be extracted by the bz mechanism ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) .",
    "the bz jet power from a bh with mass @xmath128 and angular momentum @xmath23 is ( lee et al . 2000 ; li 2000 ; wang et al . 2002 ; mckinney 2005 ; lei & zhang 2011 ) @xmath129 where @xmath130 and @xmath131[(q+1/q ) \\arctan q-1 ] \\label{eq_f}\\ ] ] here @xmath132 , and @xmath133 for @xmath36 .",
    "it apparently depends on @xmath128 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 . a strong magnetic field of @xmath136",
    "is required to produce the high luminosity of a grb .",
    "as the magnetic field on the bh is supported by the surrounding disk , there are some relations between @xmath134 and @xmath46 . in a hyper - accreting flow in a grb , it is possible that a magnetic flux is accumulated near the black hole horizon .",
    "considering the balance between the magnetic pressure on the horizon and the ram pressure of the innermost part of the accretion flow ( e.g. moderski et al . 1997 ) , one can estimate the magnetic field strength threading the bh horizon @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the radius of the bh horizon .",
    "it can be rewritten as @xmath139 inserting it to equation ( [ eq_lmag ] ) , we obtain the magnetic power as a function of mass accretion rate and bh spin , i.e. @xmath140 and @xmath141 it is found that @xmath142 , and @xmath143 . in general , a faster bh spin is more favorable for grb production , as revealed also by recent grmhd numerical simulations ( nagataki 2009 , 2011 ) .",
    "we next consider baryon loading in a bz jet .",
    "the bh magnetosphere has a `` floor '' charge density defined by the force - free condition ( goldrich & julian 1969 ) .",
    "we use it to define a minimum baryon loading rate of a bz jet .",
    "it is given by @xmath144 where @xmath145 , and @xmath146 is multiplicity of electron - positron pairs , which is rather uncertain . here",
    "@xmath147 is usually taken to maximize the bz power , and @xmath148 is the angular velocity of the bh horizon .",
    "since the magnetic field is supported by the accretion disk , in the bz model , the bh must be surrounded by a hyperaccreting ndaf .",
    "the physical processes discussed in the previous section must still happen , which tend to load baryons into the jet .",
    "the main difference is that the magnetic field threading the bh makes a strong magnetic barrier that prevents charged baryons ( protons ) to enter the jet , making a baryon poor jet ( e.g. li 2000 ) .",
    "this baryon - poor jet is surrounded and collimated by an optically thick baryonic outflow from the hyperaccreting disk ( eichler & levinson 1999 ; levinson & eichler 2003 ) .",
    "hereafter we assume that the dominant source for the baryons is the neutrino - driven wind from the hyperaccreting disk .",
    "other baryon loading processes may happen , e.g. baryon contamination from the sideways by instabilities during the propagation of the jet , or baryons entrained from the magnetic loops erupted from the disk that may enter the jet region ( e.g. yuan & zhang 2012 ) .",
    "so our model gives the _ minimum _ baryon loading in a magnetized bz jet .",
    "a strong magnetic field may change @xmath149 by altering the neutrino heating and cooling rates in the hyperaccreting disk ( zhang & dai 2010 ) .",
    "the most important effect is that electrons and positrons participating in the charged - particle reactions are restricted into discrete landau levels ( duan & qian 2004 ) . for first order estimation , in this paper we neglect these effects .    since the magnetic field only affects the charged particles , it is important to first study the composition of the wind . according to pruet , woosley & hoffman ( 2003 ) and chen & beloborodov ( 2007 ) , a hyperaccretion flow is neutron - rich in its inner region .",
    "the fraction of protons @xmath150 is only around @xmath151 , so that the majority of baryons are neutrons ( chen & beloborodov 2007 ) .",
    "the neutrino - driven wind would take the similar mass composition .",
    "the number density of neutrons in the wind can be therefore expressed as @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the fraction of neutrons , @xmath154 is neutrino emission efficiency ( eq.(1 ) ) , @xmath155 is the distance from the bh in the jet direction , which is normalized to @xmath156 cm , the typical radius of the progenitor star , @xmath157 , and @xmath158 is the wind speed .",
    "these neutrons can penetrate magnetic field lines and freely fill any location above the disk .",
    "protons are different .",
    "because of the existence of magnetic fields , only the neutrino - driven outflow in preferred directions , i.e. almost align with the magnetic field lines from the field line foot on the disk , can be ejected into the atmosphere . those protons with an ejected direction larger than an angle @xmath159 with respect to the field lines would be blocked . for a rough estimate",
    ", the proton density in the region where a local field line connects with the disk ( which is relevant for regions outside the bz jet ) can be estimated as    @xmath160    free protons and neutrons in the wind are coupled by nuclear elastic scattering . at the temperatures of interest",
    ", the corresponding rate is @xmath161 , independent of the center - of - mass energy . for a neutron ,",
    "the optical depth for elastic scattering with protons is @xmath162    during the propagation of the jet , neutrons drift from sideways into the jet .",
    "the flux of neutrons diffusing into the magnetized jet is @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is the mean free path of @xmath165 collisions , @xmath166 denotes the cylindrical radius , @xmath167 denotes the gradient length scale , @xmath168 is the wind expansion time , and @xmath169 is the neutron thermal speed . for @xmath170k , we have @xmath171 . for a typical jet opening angle @xmath172 ,",

    "the rest - frame decay time scale is @xmath174 , which corresponds to a typical decay radius of @xmath175 cm .",
    "this is not an effective mechanism to load baryons near the central engine .",
    "below we consider following two mechanisms that can quickly convert a significant fraction of neutrons to protons .    the first mechanism is positron capture . as",
    "shown in section 2 , a hyperaccreting disk produces a strong neutrino / anti - neutrino wind that deposit electron - positron pairs in the magnetized jet via neutrino annihilation ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "this leads to proton production via @xmath176 dividing the neutrino annihilation power @xmath45 ( equation ( [ eq : evv ] ) ) by the average neutrino energy @xmath177 mev , we obtain a rough estimate of the number rate of @xmath178 pairs : @xmath179 .",
    "the number density of pairs is around @xmath180 .",

    "close to the bh , a large fraction of neutrons that drifted into the bz jet would be captured .",

    ", we normalize @xmath155 to @xmath207 cm , the typical size of the central engine .",
    "the second , maybe more efficient mechanism to convert neutrons to protons is proton - neutron _",

    "the most efficient acceleration may be proceeded as @xmath227 if there is a continuous magnetic dissipation due to current instability ( giannios & spruit 2006 ) or the pulse of the shell is short enough to undergo an `` impulsive '' acceleration ( granot et al . 2011 ) .",
    "depends on the initial @xmath228 , the jet may or may not reach the full lorentz factor @xmath229 rather , more likely the unsteady jet ( as manifested by the erratic lightcurve behavior ) would undergo internal collisions , which lead to distortion of magnetic configurations and trigger an internal - collision induced magnetic reconnection and turbulence ( icmart ) avalanche to discharge the magnetic energy ( zhang & yan 2011 ) . such a process would make the outflow to reach a terminating lorentz factor @xmath5 that satisfies @xmath230 with the explicit value depending on the detailed dissipation process .",
    "the central engine parameters evolve with time during a grb , since the bh would be spun - up by accretion while spun - down by the bz mechanism .",
    "the evolution equations of a kerr bh in the bz model can be written as @xmath231    @xmath232    the evolution equation of the bh spin is then @xmath233 where @xmath234 is the total magnetic torque applied on the bh , i.e. @xmath235    in the above equations ( [ dmbz ] ) and ( [ djbz ] ) , we do not include the magnetic coupling effect between the bh and the disk through closed magnetic field lines ( li & paczynski 2000 ; wang et al .",
    "2002 ; lei et al . 2009 ; janiuk & yuan 2010 ) .",
    "similar to the blandford - znajek mechanism , the magnetic coupling effect also extracts rotational energy from the spinning bh .",
    "only if the bh spin is initially small , the magnetic coupling would act as an additional spin - up process .",
    "a similar discussion on this aspect was made by dai & liu ( 2012 ) within the context of the magnetar central engine model . in more general cases",
    ", the magnetic coupling effect would not significantly affect the bh spin evolution ( lei et al . 2009 ) .    to delineate a grb , we average the parameters over time",
    ". one may define @xmath236 .",
    "we can calculate @xmath237 and @xmath238 as discussed above .    in fig.[fig2 ] , we show the simulated 2000 grbs in the same way as we did in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . the same distributions for other parameters ( bh spin , bh mass , accretion rate , disk mass , etc ) have been adopted . both @xmath238 and @xmath237",

    ". two thousand grbs with random bh mass , bh spin , accretion rate , and disk mass have been simulated .",
    "following scaling correlations are found : @xmath241 and @xmath242 .",
    "the lorentz factor of the grb during the prompt emission phase is expected to satisfy @xmath243.,width=264 ]    by fitting fig.[fig2 ] , we find the correlations @xmath244 and @xmath245 . in the bz model , the relativistic jet dissipates its magnetic energy via icmart with an efficiency @xmath246 to produce gamma - ray emission , i.e. , @xmath247 .",
    "the efficiency can be approximated as ( zhang & yan 2011 ) @xmath248 , where @xmath249 is local magnetization parameter after the icmart event .",
    "typically one has @xmath250 .",
    "so the observed @xmath6-ray luminosity is a good proxy of the jet power @xmath251 . again considering the beaming factor correction",
    ", one can derive    @xmath252 and @xmath253 .",
    "in reality , the real @xmath5 should satisfy eq.([gamma ] ) . since both limiting lorentz factors show a correlation similar to the observations ( liang et al .",
    "2010 ; l et al .",
    "2012 ) , we suggest that the bz model would also give a @xmath254 correlation that is generally consistent with the observations . also the bz jets are much cleaner than the neutrino - driven ones , which overcome the difficulty of the neutrino - driven jets that have too much baryon contamination in the jet .",
    "the relatively large values of @xmath238 are not a big concern , since there could be other baryon loading processes besides the one considered here that would contaminate the jet even more .",
    "in this paper , we studied the baryon loading problem of a grb jet launched by a hyper - accreting bh central engine .",
    "we considered two types of jet launching mechanisms : the non - magnetized @xmath255-annihilation mechanism and the strongly magnetized blandford - znajek mechanism .",
    "for both models , we considered baryons in a neutrino - driven wind from a hyperaccreting disk . for the @xmath255-annihilation model ,",
    "the baryons launched in the neutrino - driven wind are mixed with the photons and electron - positron pairs produced by @xmath255-annihilation , and thermally accelerated to reach the termination lorentz factor @xmath256 ( see definition in equation [ [ eta ] ] ) . for a bz jet , on the other hand , protons are blocked by the strong magnetic fields at the jet boundary .",
    "only a fraction of neutrons can drift into the jet .",
    "we consider positron capture and proton - neutron inelastic collision processes and argue that about half of neutrons drifting into the jet can be converted to protons and be picked up by the jet .",
    "the other half of free neutrons would decay in the jet at larger radii , so that eventually all the neutrons can be added to the baryon loads of the jet .",
    "we calculated the minimum baryon loading of these magnetically dominated bz jets in terms of the parameter @xmath228 ( see definition in equation [ [ eq : mu ] ] ) .",
    "since magnetic acceleration is inefficient , the final lorentz factor of the grb can be between @xmath237 ( see definition in equation [ [ gamma0 ] ] ) defined by initial efficient acceleration and @xmath257 .    a phenomenological correlation between grb lorentz factor measured in the deceleration phase and grb isotropic gamma - ray luminosity has been discovered recently ( liang et al . 2010 ; l et al . 2012 ) , i.e. @xmath258 . if grb radiative efficiency does not sensitively depend on jet luminosity , this correlation would become a requirement for any grb central engine model . with monte carlo simulations , we have shown that both baryon - loading models can give cleaner jets at high luminosities .",
    "the slope of dependence is consistent with the observations ( see also l et al .",
    "2012 for a simpler @xmath255-annihilation model ) and @xmath1 correlations must then stem from more fundamental central engine physics , as is discussed in this paper . ] .",
    "the normalizations of the correlations are quite different for the two models .",
    "the @xmath255-annihilation jets are much dirtier than the bz jets . for a typical jet opening angle @xmath259",
    ", we found that the resulting @xmath86 in the neutrino - driven jet is typically below a few hundreds , and is only a few 10s for typical grb luminosities .",
    "these values are too small to be consistent with the grb data .",
    "the bz jets , on the other hand , are much cleaner .",
    "the @xmath238 values are typically in the @xmath260 range . since the icmart mechanism ( zhang & yan 2011 ) can efficiently dissipate magnetic energy and prevent accelerating the jets to @xmath238 , and",
    "since there could be additional mechanisms to load more baryons in the magnetically dominated jets , we argue that the magnetically dominated central engine model is more appealing to interpret the grb phenomenology . in view of the low normalization of the @xmath254 relation in the @xmath255-annihilation model , we suggest that at least a good fraction of grbs should have a magnetically dominated central engine",

    ", we did not consider the dependence of @xmath149 on the strength of magnetic fields .",
    "in strong magnetic fields , electrons and positrons participating in the charged - particle reactions are restricted into discrete landau levels , which may alter the neutrino heating and cooling rates , and therefore change @xmath149 .",

    "besides the discussed two mechanisms to launch the jet , it is possible that an intrinsically episodic jet is launched from the disk through a magnetic process ( yuan & zhang 2012 ) .",
