    "accelerator - based neutrino experiments with nuclear emulsion were established from the end of 1970s @xcite .",
    "the experimental concept is that of a hybrid analysis with the emulsion and the electronic detectors , so - called `` emulsion - counter hybrid experiment '' . only a small area of emulsions that is predicted by the electronic detectors has been analyzed , or only a small number of tracks that are predicted have been traced back because of the limitation of the track readout speed in the emulsions .",
    "the high - speed scanning system of the emulsion has been developed @xcite and the track readout of the entire area in the emulsion has recently become available .",
    "this allows one to analyze the emulsions independently of the prediction from the electronic detectors . in this paper ,",

    "the long - term variation of the emulsion sensitivity and background noise was investigated using cut pieces of emulsion sheets .",
    "the emulsion sensitivity was measured as grain density ( gd ) , the number of grains per 100 @xmath2 m along a minimum ionizing particle ( mip ) trajectory .",
    "the noise of the emulsion was measured as fog density ( fd ) , the number of randomly distributed grains per 1000 @xmath10 in the emulsion .",

    "an emulsion device with timing information played this role .",
    "the emulsion detector intrinsically has no timing information .",
    "therefore , the timing information is produced from the emulsion tracks by track coincidence between the films on the a mechanically controlled moving stage @xcite , a so - called the emulsion shifter .",
    "an emulsion shifter ( fig.[shifter ] ) was reused from a balloon experiment with nuclear emulsion @xcite .",

    "the temperature at the experimental site was approximately 22 @xmath16c during the exposure , as shown in fig.[temp ] .",
