    "recent developments in the drive to uncover the details of hadronic structure via high energy electron scattering have increased the interest in performing more precision measurements of nucleonic observables . among such efforts",
    "is the push to extract partonic information at large values of the scaling variable bjorken @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it is often at high @xmath0 that various corrections that scale as @xmath4 or log(@xmath2 ) become significant and render measurements and their interpretation problematic .",
    "typical of these kinds of corrections are target mass corrections ( tmcs ) , which must be implemented as one moves away from the high - energy bjorken limit at which the mass of the target nucleon may be neglected .",
    "the role of tmcs in electron - nucleon deeply inelastic scattering ( dis ) at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in @xmath1 is investigated here .",
    "we calculate the tmcs in three main prescriptions : the conventional , leading - twist ( lt ) operator product expansion ( ope ) of georgi / politzer , 1/@xmath2 expansions of these lt corrections to various orders ( which we take to be one formal prescription ) , and collinear factorization ( cf ) .",
    "historically well - established , the ope has been thoroughly deployed in the careful analysis of tmcs to the ( un)polarized structure functions ( sfs ) of dis at leading perturbative order and at twist-2 and twist-3 @xcite . in spite of this",
    ", there is a particular shortfall of the lt ope treatment to provide the proper behavior of the mass - corrected sfs at kinematic threshold .",
    "this can be made evident by considering the corrected electroweak sfs as calculated in the lt ope , and comparing these with the perturbative expansions of the same to o(1/@xmath2 ) and o(1/@xmath5 ) .",
    "as an example of one such sf that enters into the parity - violating asymmetry @xmath6 , @xmath7 is calculated at nlo in @xmath1 at two scales : @xmath8 2 , 10 gev@xmath9 . for simplicity ,",
    "the left ( right ) column in all following plots corresponds to @xmath8 2 ( 10 ) gev@xmath9 . here and in the following calculations , input sfs ( that is , before the tmc is applied ) are calculated according to standard quark - parton model ( qpm ) definitions with electroweak charges as given in the pdg .",
    "we notice that expansions to both orders of @xmath4 diverge from the lt calculation most at lowest @xmath2 and highest @xmath0 as one might expect .",
    "this effect is illustrated in figure [ fig : fig_1 ] .     over the full kinematic range ( i.e. , @xmath10 $ ] ) for fixed @xmath2 following the implementation of the ope ( solid ) , o(@xmath4 ) ( dashed ) and o(@xmath11 ) ( dot - dashed ) corrections .",
    "the non - physical threshold behavior and negative down - turn are evident in the ope and o(@xmath11 ) curves , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",height=283 ]   over the full kinematic range ( i.e. , @xmath10 $ ] ) for fixed @xmath2 following the implementation of the ope ( solid ) , o(@xmath4 ) ( dashed ) and o(@xmath11 ) ( dot - dashed ) corrections .",
    "the non - physical threshold behavior and negative down - turn are evident in the ope and o(@xmath11 ) curves , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",height=283 ]    to understand this behavior we recall that the corrected sfs in the georgi / politzer formalism are extracted via inverse mellin transforms of the lt expansions of individual sf moments @xcite to obtain for spin - unpolarized dis @xmath12 where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 ; we note also that the sfs appearing in eqn ( [ eq : gp ] ) also contain some omitted dependence on @xmath2 .",
    "the lt results for @xmath7 are plotted as the solid curves of figure [ fig : fig_1 ] .",
    "the associated dashed / dot - dashed curves are the o(@xmath4 ) and o(@xmath11 ) expansions of the lt result , respectively ; we discuss the details of this calculation below .",
    "a troubling ailment of the standard tmc treatment is evident in figure [ fig : fig_1 ] : as one approaches the lowest accessible values of @xmath2 , the mass - corrected sfs attain zero only in the non - physical region @xmath15 ; that is , momentum conservation considerations would dictate that the electroweak sfs equal zero for @xmath16 . that this does not happen",
    "is an indication that the ope incorporates some non - physical behavior in the move to low @xmath2 .",
    "one can understand the origin of this non - physical behavior by recognizing that the standard gp prescription rescales the pdfs appearing in the qpm expressions for the sfs via the parameter @xmath17 for which we note @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "as the sfs are monotonically decreasing functions of @xmath0 for a given fixed @xmath2 , the rescaling forced by this procedure dictates that the corrected sfs are upward - shifted in magnitude , attaining zero only for @xmath20 .",
    "this occurs only for non - physical @xmath16 .    in the literature",
    "this issue has come to be referred to as the ` threshold problem ' @xcite .",
    "several alternative prescriptions have been proposed to ameliorate this issue , including so - called collinear factorization , as well as a less formal approach that depends upon an o(1/@xmath2 ) expansion of the lt ope .",
    "the latter is motivated by the logic that it is the omission of the contributions from non - leading twist in the ope that induces the threshold problem .",
    "then , supposing that the o(1/@xmath2 ) expansions simulate the higher twist contribution , one might anticipate that such an expansion would cure the non - physical behavior at large @xmath0 .",
    "again , a comparison of these perturbative expansions with the lt ope are given in figure [ fig : fig_1 ] in the case of @xmath7 .    via this treatment",
    ", we may expand eqn ( [ eq : gp ] ) to lo in @xmath4 to obtain @xcite @xmath21 where there is again an understood @xmath2 dependence for all sfs on the right .",
    "the result of calculating @xmath7 as given in eqn ( [ eq : oq2 ] ) over a range of @xmath0 for low and intermediate @xmath2 is given as the dashed curves in figure [ fig : fig_1 ] . while there has been interest expressed in the literature for attempting to solve the non - physical behavior at kinematic threshold with such an expansion ,",
    "this procedure has only previously been carried out to o(@xmath4 ) .",
    "it is therefore sensible to carry out the expansion to an additional perturbative order in @xmath4 to gauge if this provides further improvement in forcing the corrected sfs to observe the limit @xmath22 . expanding the expressions in eqn ( [ eq : gp ] ) still further , we get @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 the dot - dashed curves of figure [ fig : fig_1 ] are obtained then from plotting @xmath7 from eqn ( [ eq : oq4_f2 ] ) similarly to the gp and o(@xmath4 ) curves .",
    "notable here is the fact that while the o(@xmath11 ) expansion predictably forces the corrected sfs more strongly to observe the zero limit at the kinematic threshold , it introduces a separate , non - physical behavior distinct from the threshold problem .",
    "this becomes obvious at lowest @xmath2 and highest @xmath0 and is thus an artifact of the regime in which the expansion parameter @xmath4 becomes large . in figure [ fig : fig_1 ] , the corrected sf becomes negative for @xmath26 .",
    "we illustrate this effect more explicitly in figure [ fig : fig_2 ] , in which we plot a ratio of corrected to uncorrected sfs .    , the negative downturn at low @xmath2 obtained in the @xmath27 ( dot - dashed ) expansion is more evident .",
    "we compare this to the ope ( solid ) , o(@xmath4 ) ( dashed ) , and cf ( dotted ) prescriptions.,title=\"fig:\",height=283 ] , the negative downturn at low @xmath2 obtained in the @xmath27 ( dot - dashed ) expansion is more evident .",
    "we compare this to the ope ( solid ) , o(@xmath4 ) ( dashed ) , and cf ( dotted ) prescriptions.,title=\"fig:\",height=283 ]    as the cross section is expressed in terms of these electroweak sfs , and is by the optical theorem a non - negative physical observable , we demand that the sfs be positive - definite as well . by this logic ,",
    "the negative downturn evident in figures [ fig : fig_1 ] , [ fig : fig_2 ] , etc .",
    ", is prohibited . that the higher order terms of the @xmath4 expansion induce this non - physical behavior calls into question the unlimited validity of such an approach  at least when extended to too low @xmath2 .    for completeness",
    ", we calculate effects in physical observables using the previously mentioned cf approach also .",
    "this method relies upon a choice of frame such that ( in dis ) the virtual photon and nucleon light - cone momenta are collinear ; the resulting cross section and sfs may then be expressed as a convolution of a perturbatively calculable hard coefficient with the universal pdfs in a fashion that directly incorporates the nucleon mass @xcite : @xmath28 here the bounds of integration @xmath29 are fixed by the mass - dependent kinematics . in the case of the sf @xmath30 ,",
    "this procedure yields a correction of the form @xmath31 in which @xmath32 are partonic analogs of bjorken x and the previously defined @xmath33 parameter .",
    "ultimately , we wish to obtain a prescription - independent estimate of the magnitude of the effect of tmcs in measurements of typical dis observables , such as the parity - violating asymmetry particular to electron - proton scattering .",
    "as far as experimental efforts to determine the high-@xmath0 structure of the nucleon are concerned , there is no _ a priori _ knowledge of the size of the possible contribution from tmcs , and a thorough theoretical analysis is needed to ensure that the extraction of desired signals ( such as the density function ratio @xmath34 ) is not imperiled .",
    "as noted , there is considerable experimental interest in more precise determinations of the sensitivity of the parity - violating asymmetry @xmath6 to the flavor structure of the nucleon . for electromagnetic and interference currents",
    ", the asymmetry may be expressed as @xcite @xmath35\\ , \\label{eq : apv}\\ ] ] in which the parameters @xmath36 are given by @xmath37 in particular we note that @xmath36 depend upon the ratios of longitudinal / transverse virtual photon cross sections , @xmath38 consequently , to understand the mass effect in the full asymmetry , it is important first to grasp tmcs in the setting of the electroweak @xmath39 parameters .",
    "there is a standing corpus of phenomenology @xcite to describe the electromagnetic ratio @xmath40 , but the corresponding interference quantity @xmath41 is largely undetermined . in the interest of controlling uncertainties induced by @xmath42 , an understanding of the physics that might differently break the partonic callan - gross relations for purely electromagnetic and interference processes is needed .",
    "insofar as callan - gross is strictly observed by the parton model at lo , we expect @xmath3 to be broken by perturbative corrections in @xmath1 , possible contributions from beyond twist-4 , tmcs , and other non - perturbative physics . in an effort to understand the role of nlo corrections and tmcs in producing @xmath42 , we plot a ratio of the interference to electromagnetic @xmath39 parameters in the presence of mass corrections and at nlo",
    ".     induced by the target mass and perturbative corrections .",
    "we plot a ratio @xmath43 as obtained in proton scattering .",
    "the dot - dashed curve is generated in the absence of tmcs but at nlo , whereas the solid ( ope ) , dashed ( @xmath4 expansion ) , and dotted ( cf ) curves include the nucleon mass effect as well.,title=\"fig:\",height=283 ]   induced by the target mass and perturbative corrections .",

    "the dot - dashed curve is generated in the absence of tmcs but at nlo , whereas the solid ( ope ) , dashed ( @xmath4 expansion ) , and dotted ( cf ) curves include the nucleon mass effect as well.,title=\"fig:\",height=283 ]    we compute this ratio using the definitions of eqn ( [ eq : rdef ] ) , in which the parton model expressions for the sfs are typical of proton ( figure [ fig : fig_3 ] ) and deuteron ( figure [ fig : fig_4 ] ) scattering . the results , which are largely independent of @xmath2 , establish the largest deviation from @xmath44 at low @xmath0 , where the effect has a magnitude @xmath45 .",
    "this becomes more shallow as one moves to highest @xmath0 ; also of note is the fact that tmcs undermine the correction to @xmath43 due to calculation at nlo .",
    "the picture of the breaking of @xmath3 is qualitatively similar for the deuteron , but with the size of the effect diminished by several percent .",
    "as with the proton calculation , the strongest departure of the ratio plotted in figure [ fig : fig_4 ] from unity is obtained at low @xmath0  in this case @xmath46 , at which @xmath47 .",
    "this smaller effect is consistent with the nature of the deuteron as an iso - scalar target , which leads to the large - scale cancellation of flavor - dependence .    , but for @xmath43 as determined in electron - deuteron scattering .",
    "here , the nature of the deuteron as an iso - scalar target softens the breaking of @xmath3 .",
    "the conventions for the linestyles are identical to figure [ fig : fig_3].,title=\"fig:\",height=283 ] , but for @xmath43 as determined in electron - deuteron scattering . here",
    ", the nature of the deuteron as an iso - scalar target softens the breaking of @xmath3 .",
    "the conventions for the linestyles are identical to figure [ fig : fig_3].,title=\"fig:\",height=283 ]    with some understanding of the behavior of @xmath41 and @xmath40 under tmcs , we wish to perform a similar calculation in the full , parity - violating asymmetry @xmath6 . as before ,",
    "we consider a ratio of corrected / uncorrected asymmetries in the various prescriptions ; the result of this calculation at low and intermediate @xmath2 is given in figure [ fig : fig_5 ] .     at low and intermediate @xmath2 .",
    "we plot the mass effect in our three primary prescriptions  the ope ( solid ) , o(1/@xmath2 ) expansion ( dashed ) , and cf ( dotted ) treatments.,title=\"fig:\",height=283 ]   at low and intermediate @xmath2 .",
    "we plot the mass effect in our three primary prescriptions  the ope ( solid ) , o(1/@xmath2 ) expansion ( dashed ) , and cf ( dotted ) treatments.,title=\"fig:\",height=283 ]    for low @xmath2 , we note a relative similarity among the various prescriptions to intermediate @xmath48 at which the effect of tmcs is @xmath49 ; as one moves to largest @xmath0 , the ope and cf treatments obtain the greatest effect ( @xmath50 ) , whereas the o(1/@xmath2 ) expansion of the lt ope falls to zero .",
    "these effects are quickly suppressed as one evolves to intermediate @xmath51 gev@xmath9 for which the tmcs are @xmath52 , and the o(1/@xmath2 ) expansion agrees with the other prescriptions to higher @xmath0 .",
    "this observation is consistent with the general message for experimental efforts : though mass effects can be sizable for lower values of @xmath2 , they may be brought into considerable control by moving to modestly larger @xmath2 at which the computed tmcs exhibit less model - dependence .",
    "it is natural to extend this calculation to the deuteron , for which the property of iso - scalarity diminishes flavor - dependence as previously noted ; the resulting asymmetry is dependent only on the electroweak couplings and the kinematical parameters @xmath36 @xcite : @xmath53\\ , \\ ] ] where the @xmath54 , etc are coupling constants .",
    "the disappearance of the explicit dependence of the deuteron asymmetry on sfs leads to a very small sensitivity to tmcs : generally , even at small @xmath2 , the mass effect in the deuteron is sub - percent and model - independent in the sense that the various prescriptions outlined here yield similarly small corrections .",
    "this is promising for experimental efforts that aim ( for instance ) to precisely extract the electroweak coupling constants from electron - deuteron scattering events .    .",
    "as with figure [ fig : fig_5 ] , the prescriptions are the ope ( solid ) , o(@xmath4 ) expansion ( dashed ) , and cf ( dotted).,title=\"fig:\",height=283 ] . as with figure",
    "[ fig : fig_5 ] , the prescriptions are the ope ( solid ) , o(@xmath4 ) expansion ( dashed ) , and cf ( dotted).,title=\"fig:\",height=283 ]",
    "lastly , as the sf ratio @xmath55 is sensitive to the behavior of the pdf ratio @xmath34 , it has attracted substantial interest as a means of constraining various quark models . this is apparent if we observe , for example , that if the large-@xmath0 ratio @xmath56 , then the sf ratio behaves as @xmath57 . given this interest in the phenomenology of @xmath58 ( particularly at large @xmath0 where tmcs are often more pronounced )",
    ", a picture of the mass corrections to @xmath58 would be helpful .",
    "such an illustration of the relative mass effect is given in figure [ fig : fig_6 ] .",
    "as with @xmath6 we plot a correction ratio @xmath59 for @xmath60 gev@xmath9 , and obtain a result which qualitatively closely resembles the full proton asymmetry  up to the scale of the effect . here again , the size of the correction , as well as the agreement among the various prescriptions are dramatically improved by modestly evolving upward in @xmath2 .    in conclusion , while the tmcs and perturbative corrections in @xmath1 are considerable at lowest @xmath2 where other @xmath4 and log(@xmath2 ) effects become important , they may be controlled in experimental efforts .",
    "in particular , performing measurements at higher @xmath2 and choosing iso - scalar targets enables one to cleanly probe nucleon structure with less need to worry about possible model - dependent mass effects .",
    "still , the issues of the kinds of physics that might produce @xmath61 and the possible implications for high-@xmath0 phenomenology remain rich and largely unexplored topics ."
