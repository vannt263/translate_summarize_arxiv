    "<S> the effective quark mass @xmath12 appearing due to the spontaneous breakdown of the chiral symmetry is momentum dependent so that the mass term in the above lagrangian should be understood in the following sense @xmath13 let us start from the simplified calculation neglecting the momentum dependence of the quark mass . in the leading order of the large number of quark colors we have in this model @xmath14 @xmath15\\ ] ] @xmath16 } \\ , . </S>",
