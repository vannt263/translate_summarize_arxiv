    "this paper is a continuation of our @xcite , which will be referred to as i. the main result there gives a lower bound for the number of nodal domains for maass forms on a compact part of the modular surface .",
    "we indicated in i that the techniques there can be modified and extended to deal with a general arithmetic surface .",
    "our aim here is to carry this out .",
    "the treatment in i relies heavily on the fourier expansions of the maass forms in the cusp , and for a compact surface these are not available .",
    "our primary focus here will be on the compact cases .",
    "for the most part we use the same notation and terminology as in i.    let @xmath0 be a finite area hyperbolic surface .",
    "let @xmath1 be the laplacian on functions of @xmath2 , and @xmath3 ( or @xmath4 ) will denote @xmath5-eigenfunctions with eigenvalue @xmath6  ( functions @xmath3 are also called maass forms @xcite ) .",
    "we let @xmath7 be an isometric involution on @xmath2 which is induced from a hyperbolic reflection on @xmath8 .",
    "next , we let @xmath9 denote the points of @xmath2 fixed by @xmath10 ; it consists of a union ( possibly disconnected ) of piecewise geodesics in @xmath2 ( see section 2 ) .",
    "our main interest is when @xmath11 is compact unlike the case in i where @xmath11 ran into the cusps of @xmath2 .",
    "by @xmath4 we will always mean a @xmath10-even eigenfunction of @xmath1 ( we could just as well deal with @xmath10-odd as indicated in the appendix of i ) .",
    "the nodal domains @xmath12 of @xmath4 are inert or split according as @xmath13 is equal to @xmath12 or is empty .",
    "the method we use in i to produce inert nodal domains involved three parts .",
    "the first part is a topological reduction , the second an investigation of lower bounds of @xmath5-restrictions of @xmath4 to @xmath11 .",
    "this last appeals to que ( quantum unique ergodicity @xcite ) but involves no arithmetic input .",
    "it is in the third step where we need @xmath4 to be a hecke eigenfunction as well , that we assume @xmath2 is arithmetic .",
    "this allows us to use proven que in these cases ( @xcite ) , subconvexity @xmath14-bounds for eigenfunctions ( @xcite ) and the theory of automorphic @xmath15-functions .",
    "all of these go into the proof of our main theorem 1.4 below .",
    "we turn to the precise statements of our results and an outline of the paper . in section 2",
    "we give an extension of theorem 2.1 of i to a general surface @xmath2 of genus @xmath16 and for a general @xmath11 , which may be non - separating ( for another proof of this extension in the separating case , see @xcite , section 7 ) ;    let @xmath17 be the number of inert nodal domains of @xmath4 and let @xmath18 denote the number of sign - changes of @xmath4 along @xmath11 .",
    "then @xmath19    in order to study the sign - changes of @xmath3 s along curves @xmath20 in @xmath2 , we examine the restriction of @xmath3 and its unit normal derivative @xmath21 to @xmath20 . by green s theorem ,",
    "separating variables and some elementary analysis we derive lower bounds for these restrictions for simple closed curves @xmath20 of constant geodesic curvature @xmath22 on a hyperbolic surface @xmath23 , which is either @xmath8 or a cylinder . in each case",
    ", the curve divides @xmath23 into inside and outside regions , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we have the following type of lower bound for @xmath26 ( propositions 3.2 and 3.4 ) , and for other @xmath27 s for which an extra term is needed .",
    "let @xmath23 , @xmath20 and @xmath24 be as above .",
    "then , for any eigenfunction @xmath3 which is in @xmath28 , we have @xmath29 with respective invariant measures .",
    "the function @xmath30 is a positive smooth weight function depending only on @xmath23 and @xmath20 , and not on @xmath3 .    for our main application",
    "we need a lower bound as above for the case that @xmath20 is a closed geodesic ( i.e. @xmath31 ) . in this case an inequality as in theorem 1.2 involving only a positive weight function is not valid ( see section 3.5 ) .",
    "however as in i one can infer a similar lower bound if one inputs the equidistribution that comes from que . in i , this was achieved using some arithmetical input as well ( and for the `` infinite '' closed geodesic ) . in section 4 we use some representation theory and the full micro - local wigner measures to prove ;    [ closed - g - intro ] let @xmath2 be a hyperbolic surface , @xmath20 a closed geodesic on @xmath2 and @xmath32 a sequence of eigenfunctions on @xmath2 satisfying que ( that is @xmath33 and @xmath34 as @xmath35 for any zeroth order p.d.o with symbol a ) .",
    "then for @xmath36 large enough we have @xmath37 here the implied constant depending only on @xmath20 and @xmath2 .",
    "starting with section 5 and for the rest of the paper , we assume that the surface @xmath2 is arithmetic ( in fact a congruence surface ) , which carries an involution , and that @xmath4 is a @xmath10-even and a hecke eigenfunction .",
    "this allows us to bring in various arithmetical tools as in i. the most significant new one being waldspurger s formula @xcite which allows one to express @xmath38 in terms of the central values of @xmath15-functions of automorphic forms on @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a quadratic extension associated to the closed geodesic @xmath11 in @xmath2 . with this and following the technique in i",
    ", we obtain our main result ;    [ nodal - domains - thm - intro ] let @xmath2 , @xmath10 and @xmath41 be as above . then assuming the lindelf hypothesis for the @xmath15-functions of the gl@xmath42 cusp forms , we have that as @xmath43 @xmath44 for any @xmath45 .",
    "the implied constant depends only on @xmath46 , @xmath2 and @xmath10 .",
    "[ sup - norm - remark ]     ( a ) .",
    "as noted in i , this lower bound is no doubt far from the truth .",
    "from @xcite it follows that @xmath47 and this upper bound is probably sharp .",
    "as far as split nodal domains we do not know how to produce any of them in spite of the fact that they are probably the vast majority .",
    "the expectation is that @xmath48  , where @xmath49 is the nazarov - sodin constant @xcite    ( b ) .",
    "if @xmath2 comes from a quaternion algebra defined over @xmath50 ( rather than a more general totally real field @xmath51 ) , then the exponent @xmath52 can be replaced by @xmath53 , see section [ waldspurger - sect ] .    in section 6",
    "we examine in some detail a variety of examples of arithmetic surfaces @xmath2 with involutions @xmath10 and the corresponding set @xmath11 , to which our results apply .",

    "they first give a localised ( i.e. to a piece of geodesic ) version of theorem 1.3 which is valid more generally ( i.e. is not restricted to hyperbolic surfaces ) .",
    "they then go on to introduce a novel method of studying weak limits of renormalizations of the restrictions of the @xmath41 s in theorem 1.4 to @xmath11 , and in particular the positive definiteness of their fourier transforms . using this they prove without any hypothesis that in the setting of theorem 1.4 , @xmath54 ( and so afortiori @xmath55 ) goes to infinity with @xmath56 !    0.2",
