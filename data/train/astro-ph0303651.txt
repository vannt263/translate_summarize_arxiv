    "infrared - dark clouds ( irdcs ) have been identified by their substantial mid - infrared ( 8 - 25@xmath0 m ) extinction in _ midcourse space experiment _ ( msx ) images @xcite .",
    "egan et al .",
    "concluded from the high mid - infrared opacities of the irdcs that they possess hundreds of magnitudes of visual extinction and contain large column densities of cold dust .",
    "they derived characteristic physical parameters for the gas inside the irdcs : @xmath5  0.5  15pc , @xmath6  @xmath7  10  20k , n(h@xmath8 )  @xmath9  10@xmath10  @xmath11 , and h@xmath8 column densities ranging up to 10@xmath12  @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "a number of irdcs have been mapped with scuba on the jcmt @xcite and are found to have the mid - infrared absorption closely associated with filamentary and/or floculent clouds in emission at 850 and 450@xmath0 m .",
    "bright , compact sources with masses in the range @xmath7  10 to 10@xmath14  m@xmath15 and infall / outflow signatures are located along the filaments and appear to be in a variety of the early stages of star formation .",
    "the larger irdcs appear to be similar in size to the orion molecular cloud but different in many important aspects .",
    "they are more heavily extincted , colder , more quiescent , and at earlier stages of evolution .    for the work reported in this paper",
    ", we investigate the irdc g11.11 - 0.12 , at a kinematic distance of 3.6  kpc @xcite , because it contains several long , filamentary segments seen against a relatively uniform galactic background at 8@xmath0 m ( fig .",
    "[ f_8 ] ) . @xcite first reported jcmt observations of this source .",
    "star formation appears to be more active in the southern part of the cloud than the northern half , with bright , compact scuba sources ( labelled p1 , p6 and p7 in fig .",
    "[ f_850 ] ) .",
    "the p1 source is driving a molecular outflow and is associated with a weak point source of 8@xmath0 m emission .",
    "there is no evidence of high - mass star formation throughout most of the cloud .",
    "the catalog of @xcite lists two uchii regions in the vicinity of g11.11 - 0.12 , but they are far enough away that they are unlikely to be affecting the irdc properties even if they are at the same distance .",
    "jcmt scuba observations were obtained at 850@xmath0 m under fair weather conditions ( @xmath16= 0.24  0.30 ) in april 1999 with an angular resolution of 14.5@xmath17 .",
    "`` scan mapping '' was employed to produce nyquist - sampled images .",
    "the data were taken with the standard observing set - up using chop throws of 20@xmath17 , 30@xmath17 and 65@xmath17 at position angles of 0@xmath18 and 90@xmath18 .",
    "the data were processed using the jcmt data reduction pipeline ( orac ) to flatfield , extinction correct and calibrate the chop data @xcite .",
    "the calibration accuracy is good to @xmath19% @xcite . the optimal map reconstruction ( see fig .  [ f_850 ] )",
    "was then performed from the individual chop measurements , using a matrix inversion technique outlined by @xcite .",
    "slowly varying spatial features with wavelengths much longer than the maximum chop , 65@xmath17 , are not measured reliably ; thus , large , low - amplitude structures in the reconstructed map tend to be artifacts .",
    "further descriptions of scuba and its observing modes can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "heterodyne observations of @xmath20co  ( @xmath21 ) and c@xmath22o  ( @xmath21 ) were taken near the p2 region of g11.11 - 0.12 with receiver rxa3 on the jcmt during several observing sessions in july 2000 , april 2001 , and june 2001 .",
    "the velocity dispersion within the cloud can be estimated by fitting single component gaussians to the line profiles .",
    "typical linewidths obtained have @xmath23km@xmath24s@xmath25 for the @xmath20co line and @xmath26km@xmath24s@xmath25 for the c@xmath22o line . the temperature of the gas in the segment of the filament labelled p2 ( fig .",
    "[ f_850 ] ) has been estimated from h@xmath8co observations by @xcite to be less than 20  k.",
    "the extinction of background emission at 8@xmath0 m is due to the presence of dust within the g11.11 - 0.12 filament .",
    "this same dust radiates at submillimeter wavelengths and is observable as emission in the 850@xmath0 m image .",
    "it is expected that there should be a strong correlation between the extinction and emission maps , and this is indeed seen in figs .  [ f_8 ] and [ f_850 ]",
    ". the correlation is complicated by several factors : ( 1 ) the diffuse background emission at 8@xmath0 m , which the molecular cloud extinguishes , is not entirely smooth ; ( 2 ) star formation occurring at p1 produces 8@xmath0 m emission ; ( 3 ) the zero submillimeter emission baseline is poorly defined ; ( 4 ) the measured emission and absorption properties are beam - convolved ; ( 5 ) the dust temperature and emissivity may change with location in the cloud because the degree of dust coagulation and freeze - out of molecules onto grain mantles depend on the local physical conditions , such as density and temperature .",
    "statistically relevant results can be obtained by analyzing a large sample of measurements , despite the above caveats .",
    "[ f_dust ] shows the 8@xmath0 m emission versus the 850@xmath0 m emission for each location across the filament , along with the median 8@xmath0 m flux as a function of 850@xmath0 m emission .",
    "the trend in both the data and the median curve is clear : the 8@xmath0 m flux decreases due to extinction as the 850@xmath0 m flux increases .",
    "the highest 850@xmath0 m emission points do not follow this trend because of the presence of an energetic protostellar source ( p1 ) within the deepest part of the cloud that is altering the temperature of the dust and producing weak 8@xmath0 m emission .",
    "given the clear trends in fig .",
    "[ f_dust ] , a simple dust model may be fit to the data . at each location",
    "@xmath27 across the filament , the measured 8@xmath0 m flux density @xmath28 depends on an unvarying foreground @xmath29 and background @xmath30 emission , and the optical depth through the cloud @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the absorption coefficient of the gas plus dust at wavelength @xmath33(@xmath0 m ) and @xmath34 is the column density of material within the intervening cloud .",
    "explicitly , @xmath35   + f_{8}({\\rm fg}).\\ ] ] the column density of the cloud is related to the the observed flux density @xmath36 ( measured in jy / beam ) , for the optically thin submillimeter emission , by the equation @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the planck function at @xmath33 and @xmath39 is the solid angle subtended by the telescope beam .",
    "thus , the optical depth at 8@xmath0 m , which is given by @xmath40 , is linearly related to the observed flux at 850@xmath0 m , with @xmath41 defined by @xmath42 .",
    "the correlation between the flux at 8@xmath0 m and 850@xmath0 m in fig .",
    "[ f_dust ] allows for a determination of @xmath41 ( and @xmath30 , @xmath29 ) .",
    "the overlaid dashed line in fig .",
    "[ f_dust ] is based on the best - fit model , with @xmath43 , @xmath44wm@xmath45sr@xmath25 , and @xmath46wm@xmath45sr@xmath25 .",
    "excellent fits are found for a small range around @xmath47 , implying @xmath48 observations of molecular lines provide a range of gas temperatures , @xmath6  @xmath7  10  20k , with a best - fit value of @xmath49k .",
    "theoretical models of the dust temperature toward highly extincted cloud centers @xcite yield lower limits of 5  8k .",
    "the corresponding limits on the opacity ratio are 1010 if @xmath50k and 50 if @xmath51k .    for diffuse interstellar dust",
    "the expected opacity ratio is @xmath52 @xcite ; however , ice mantles form on the surfaces of dust grains in dense molecular clouds and the grains themselves coagulate .",
    "this increases the submillimeter opacity and obscures the silicate features that account for most of the opacity at 8@xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "ossenkopf and henning found that , after @xmath53yrs of coagulation , dust with thin ice mantles entrained in cold ( @xmath54k ) gas with number density @xmath55@xmath11 produced an opacity ratio between 8@xmath0 m and 850@xmath0 m of @xmath56 , consistent with these observations if the dust temperature is @xmath57k .",
    "@xcite found a similar increase in the importance of submillimeter emission compared to ( near ) infrared extinction in the filamentary cloud ic 5148 .",
    "these result are consistent with evidence for dust growth in cold , dense protoplanetary disks where observations of the slope of the spectral energy distribution are used @xcite    all reasonable dust models require a foreground 8@xmath0 m emission of @xmath58 which implies that half of the diffuse mid - infrared emission is produced _ in front _ of the filament .",
    "this is intriguing given that g11.11 - 0.12 is only 3.6 kpc away and on the near side of the galactic center .",
    "the diffuse 8@xmath0 m emission , while relatively uniform across the irdc , must be significantly patchy on galactic scales .",
    "the simplest equilibrium model for a filament is that of an isothermal cylinder @xcite where the density profile as a function of cylindrical radius @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the central density and @xmath62 is the core radius defined by @xmath63 .",
    "the velocity dispersion @xmath64 should be derived from the temperature of the gas for a true isothermal cylinder . however , in most astrophysical cases the measured velocity dispersion within the molecular cloud includes a significant  non - thermal \" ( turbulent ) component .",
    "the surface density profile for an edge on isothermal cylinder is : @xmath65 where @xmath66 .",
    "the surface density profile becomes @xmath67 , at large projected distances from the center of the cylinder .",
    "most studied filamentary clouds are not well - fit by this profile .",
    "l97 in cygnus @xcite , the integral shaped filament ( isf ) in orion a @xcite , ic5146 @xcite , and a quiescent filament in taurus @xcite are all better fit by shallow density profiles with @xmath68 , which are consistent with surface density profiles of @xmath69 .",
    "such profiles are well - fit by the @xcite model , which features a helical magnetic field .",
    "the @xmath70 density profile is obtained in fp models with a dominant toroidal field component , but steeper profiles are possible when the poloidal field dominates .",
    "submillimeter polarization measurements trace the geometry of the magnetic field and provide additional evidence in support of the fp helical field model , which has been shown to agree with polarization maps of the isf @xcite and ngc2024 @xcite .    the radial structure of two well - defined regions of the g11.11 - 0.12 filament , a northern segment including p3 and p4 , and a southern segment including p1 and p2 , have been analyzed .",
    "the average intensity distributions orthogonal to the spine of the filament were determined using the same technique as applied to the isf @xcite , and are presented in fig .",
    "[ f_profile ] .",
    "the g11.11 - 0.12 segments appear similar to each other , with a marginally resolved central region connecting to an outer region characterized by a density profile steeper than @xmath71 .",
    "this is in contrast to results for the isf where the central region is unresolved , and whose surface density only falls off as @xmath72 at large radii @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "the emission from each section of g11.11 - 0.12 is reasonably fit by an isothermal profile ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ f_profile ] ) allowing for an estimation of the core radius @xmath62 .",
    "the core radius varies from @xmath74pc in the northern segment to @xmath75pc in the southern segment ( assuming a @xmath76kpc distance to g11.11 - 0.12 ) .",
    "the measured peak flux is @xmath77jy / beam and @xmath78jy / beam , respectively , where the uncertainty in the peak flux is primarily due to uncertainties in the 850@xmath0 m calibration .",
    "the observed dust emission can be converted to a central surface density @xmath79 , despite uncertainty in both the dust temperature and emissivity , using @xmath80\\ \\ { \\rm g\\,cm}^{-2}.\\ ] ] assuming a typical dust temperature of @xmath81k , a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 , and a dust emissivity @xmath82 @xcite , the central surface density is @xmath83g@xmath13 in the northern segment and @xmath84g@xmath13 in the southern segment .",
    "if the dust temperature were much lower , the column density would be significantly larger .",
    "the central number density of h@xmath8 atoms can also be derived from the profile : @xmath85 { \\rm cm}^{-3}.\\ ] ] for the canonical dust properties , @xmath86@xmath11 in the northern segment , and @xmath87@xmath11 in the southern segment .",
    "the measured c@xmath22o linewidth observed for g11.11 - 0.12 near the location of p2 is @xmath26km / s , allowing for an independent measure of the central density , @xmath88@xmath11 , via the core radius definition .",
    "the agreement between these two derivations of central density provides support for the isothermal model .",
    "however , more complex filamentary models , including poloidal and toroidal magnetic components , may produce as good or better fits to the data @xcite .",
    "g11.11 - 0.12 is the first molecular filament observed to have a radial density profile steeper than @xmath71 at large radii @xmath73 .",
    "a non - magnetic isothermal cylinder model @xcite provides a reasonable fit to both the profile and the measured constraints : submillimeter flux , temperature , velocity dispersion , and core radius .",
    "the data might also be consistent with the generalized magnetic stodolkiewicz model @xcite , whose density profile is identical to that of the ostriker model , except that the core radius definition takes into account the effects of a helical magnetic field .",
    "the data are not consistent with the toroidally dominated regime of the fp model , which results in much more shallow density profiles @xcite .",
    "work is in progress to provide a detailed parameter space exploration and numerical fits to the ostriker model , the generalized stodolkiewicz model and the full range of the fp model , including the steep profiled regime that is dominated by the poloidal field component .",
    "the irdcs are thought to be a cold , dense , and quiescent class of molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "the dust properties measured for g11.11 - 0.12 between the mid - infrared and the submillimeter are consistent with this interpretation ; however , the theoretical models of @xcite require approximately 10@xmath89yrs for grain coagulation to become important and thus place a lower limit on the lifetime of the cloud .",
    "the dynamical time of a self - gravitating non - magnetic isothermal filament , @xmath90 , on which the filament might be expected to fragment and form stars , is similar to the crossing time @xmath91 , which can be calculated directly from the observations ; @xmath92yrs .",
    "thus , the required coagulation time does not pose severe constraints on the equilibrium of the filament .",
    "it is harder to reconcile the filament s moderate central density @xmath93@xmath11 , which is well below the value of @xmath94@xmath11 assumed by ossenkopf and henning in their coagulation calculations .",
    "it is possible that the dense gas in the core of the filament is clumped .",
    "further studies of the correlation between 8@xmath0 m extinction and submillimeter emission in this and other irdcs should prove beneficial .",
