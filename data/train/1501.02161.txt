    "in the context of ordinary category theory , grothendieck s theory of fibrations  @xcite can be used to give an alternative description of functors to the category @xmath1 of categories .",

    "the _ grothendieck construction _ gives a simple description of the fibration associated to a functor @xmath3 ; this can also be described formally as a certain weighted colimit , namely the oplax colimit of the functor @xmath4 . for , on the other hand , the equivalence between cartesian fibrations and functors has been proved by lurie using the _ straightening functor _ , a certain left quillen functor between model categories .",
    "this leaves the corresponding right adjoint , the _ unstraightening _ functor , quite inexplicit .",
    "one of our main goals in this paper is to show that lurie s unstraightening functor is a model for the analogue of the grothendieck construction .",
    "more precisely , we introduce versions of lax and oplax limits and colimits and prove the following :       a.   suppose @xmath5 is a functor of , and @xmath6 is a cocartesian fibration associated to @xmath4 .",

    "then @xmath7 is the oplax colimit of the functor @xmath4 .    to prove this we make use of an explicit description of the free cartesian fibration associated to an arbitary functor of .",

    "we say that @xmath22 is _ lax representable _ when this is the case . as application of our theorems , we show that , if @xmath25 is a lax representable cartesian fibration such that the mapping functor @xmath26 is tensored and cotensored over @xmath2 , and @xmath27 is any , then the exponential @xmath28 is itself lax representable .",
    "this can be used , for example , to describe the various functorialities of twisted cohomology theories .",
    "the third main result of this paper provides a useful extension of the theory of presentable in the context of cartesian fibrations .",
    "while the theory of _ accessible _ and _ presentable _ categories is already an important part of ordinary category theory , when working with the analogous notions turn out to be indispensable .",
