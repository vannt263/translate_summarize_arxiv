    "in particular , frustrated total internal reflection ( ftir ) is considered as a classical analogy of quantum - mechanical tunneling . in this case , optical fields penetrate across an air gap between two adjacent glass prisms , giving transmission of light beyond the critical angle  @xcite . until now",
    ", it is generally believed that the photon tunneling is a two - dimensional process  @xcite : tunneling only occurs in the incidence plane . however , the total angular momentum is unconserved in the two - dimensional ftir  @xcite .",
    "this difficulty arises from the neglect of orbital angular momentum caused by transverse spatial shift of field centroid  @xcite .",
