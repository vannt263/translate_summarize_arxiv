    "the question of how large is the speed of gravity may seem meaningless at first sight . in general relativity there is no  gravitational field \" , which could  propagate \" .",
    "there is only a ( curved ) four - dimensional spacetime and the word  gravitational \" essentially means  related to the shape of that spacetime \" .",
    "and one does not ask :  what is the speed of a sphere s being a sphere ? \"    imagine , on the other hand , an observer @xmath0 who watches a rock held by a person @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath0 wants to know whether the rock will be thrown .",
    "apparently , this event | throwing of the rock , let us denote it @xmath2 | can be detected by @xmath0 even without looking at @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , the moment the rock starts to move , its distance from the observer will start to change .",
    "so , if the observer s apparatus is good enough , it will detect  at some moment @xmath4  changes in the gravitational field of the rock , which will mean that the rock is thrown .",
    "it seems absolutely natural to interpret the event @xmath4 as receiving by the observer a _ gravitational signal _ from @xmath5 . and",
    "it is equally natural to ask : how soon after @xmath2 can @xmath4 happen ? can , in particular , @xmath4 happen _ before _ the first photon from @xmath2 will reach the observer .",
    "in other words , what is the speed of gravity and are there any restrictions on this speed ?",
    "problems in answering those questions arise immediately as one tries to make the outlined naive picture more precise .",
    "indeed , we have described @xmath4 as the point at which the observer notices the first changes in the metric .",
    "but changes _ with respect to what _ ?",
    "it is definitely _ not _ changes w.  r.  t. some previous moment of time ( in a non - static world the metric changes all the time even while the rock is at rest ) .",
    "neither it is a deviation from some background ( contrary to what is often assumed in the gravitational waves theory ) , because generally there is no way to unambiguously split the metric into  background \" and  perturbation \" ( cf .",
    " 35.1 in @xcite ) .",
    "actually , what is meant are changes w.  r.  t. what _ would _ there be there in the world in which the rock is not thrown .",
    "so , we have to compare _ two different spacetimes _ : the spacetime , denote it @xmath6 , in which @xmath3 throws the rock in @xmath2 and the spacetime @xmath7 in which he does not . proceeding along these lines",
    "one has to solve the following two problems ( the former being essentially a matter of language in which the latter is to be discussed ) :    1 .   to tell whether the geometry about @xmath8 differs from what would have been",
    "there were the rock not thrown , we must find a point @xmath9 corresponding to @xmath10 and compare somehow the metric in @xmath10 with that in @xmath11 .",
    "but no canonical ways are seen how to bring points of non - isometric spacetimes in one - to - one correspondence .",
    "2 .   our goal is to establish ( an analog of ) the cause  effect relation .",
    "the introduction of the pair @xmath12 instead of a single spacetime enables us to formulate the task in terms of  changes in the geometry \" : the problem now reduces to telling the changes caused by @xmath2 from any other possible differences between @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( such as caused , for instance , by a set of independent events ) .",
    "this , however , can not be done ( exclusively ) on the basis of equations of motion .",
    "the point is that the concepts  such as the field value , the energy density , the group velocity , etc .  pertinent to evolution of a field , have no  self - evident \" relation to concepts  such as signal , cause , etc . ",
    "determining which elements of the theory are considered freely specifiable . to relate these two parts of a theory one",
    "need a convention ( postulate , definition ) additional to the equation of motion .",
    "we start with formalizing the idea that two different spacetimes may be `` same up to some event @xmath2 '' , _ i.  e. , _ may have a  common origin \" .",
    "definition[def : alt ] a pair of pointed inextendible spacetimes @xmath13 is called an _ alternative _ , if there exists a connected open past set @xmath14 and an isometry @xmath15 such that @xmath16 .",
    "thus @xmath6 and @xmath7 are different extensions of the same ( extendible ) spacetime @xmath17 .    to overcome the first of the problems indicated in the introduction we concentrate on the points which are _ not _ affected by @xmath2 ( the  common origin \" of the two universes ) . for a given alternative the pair @xmath18 need not be unique , there may exist a whole family @xmath19 of such pairs",
    ". by @xmath20 and @xmath21 we shall denote the _ maximal _ elements of this family , i.  e. , such that @xmath22{0.4pt}{1.4em } \\",
    ", \\raisebox{-.55em}{$\\displaystyle{}_{n^\\alpha_1}$ }   } , \\qquad\\forall\\,\\alpha.\\ ] ] it is @xmath23 ( and @xmath24 isometric to it ) that describe the above - mentioned common origin .",
    "remarkthe reason to require @xmath20 to be past sets is simple : even if somewhere in @xmath25 there are isometric domains , they can hardly be reckoned among those constituting the common origin of @xmath25 , if their inhabitants remember different histories .",
    "a more local characteristic of gravitational communication is the front     definition the sets @xmath26 will be termed _",
    "fronts_. a front @xmath27 is called _ superluminal _ if @xmath28 .",
    "now given a theory ( by which i mean a set of matter fields with equations relating them to geometry ) one makes the following step and adopts a convention defining what in that theory is considered freely specifiable .",
    "namely , one decides what class of alternatives are _ admissible _ , i.  e. , in what cases the difference between the spacetimes @xmath29 and @xmath30 is attributable to the event @xmath2 ( modeled in our approach by two points at once : @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) .",
    "this being done , one can check whether the fronts of admissible alternatives may be superluminal and , if so , decides whether the theory should be dismissed on that ground .",
    "let us apply the abovesaid to general relativity . to this end",
    "we , first , assume that the universe is described by a spacetime on which some  matter fields \" are defined .",
    "the latter are subject to some conditions , see below , and the metric solves the einstein equations . as was argued in the introduction , however , to specify the theory we must adopt one more convention .",
    "convention[conv : admis ] an alternative @xmath12 , where both spacetimes are globally hyperbolic , is admissible ( _ i .",
    "e. , _ @xmath6 and @xmath7 are regarded as differed by @xmath2 and its consequences , rather than two _ initially _ different universes ) only if in @xmath6 and @xmath7 there are cauchy surfaces @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively , such that @xmath35 and the values of all fields and their derivatives in the corresponding points of @xmath36 and @xmath37 are same rather than of the points _ per se _ , but for simplicity we shall neglect such subtleties . ] .",
    "it should be stressed that this convention is an independent element of theory .",
    "even though it seems so  natural \" ( and is often regarded as  self - evident \" , see @xcite for example ) , it does not , in fact , follow from , say , the field equations , or any first principles .",
    "suppose for instance , that each time one makes the metric strictly flat on some three - dimensional disk @xmath38 ( and _ only _ in such a case ) it turns out that the metric is also strictly flat on a @xmath39 lying on the same cauchy surface @xmath40 ( say , a kilometer to the north - west of @xmath38 ) .",
    "be such a phenomenon discovered , one probably would wish to call it superluminal signalling .",
    "convention  [ conv : admis ] would have to be abandoned [ because no admissible alternative to @xmath41 is ever observed , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 is a metric flat on @xmath38 ] , even though the field equations and the einstein equation are not compromised .",
    "now suppose , that both @xmath6 and @xmath7 are globally hyperbolic and the alternative @xmath12 is admissible .",
    "the question of whether the @xmath45-th front is superluminal reduces to the question of whether @xmath46 ( or , correspondingly , @xmath47 ) can be extended to the entire @xmath48 .",
    "but the global hyperbolicity of @xmath6 , @xmath7 implies the equality @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the cauchy development of @xmath51 . by the theorems of existence and uniqueness for the einstein equations , the equality of the data on a surface implies ( under some assumptions which we shall discuss in a moment ) isometry of the resulting cauchy developments .",
    "so , the domains @xmath52 are isometric and we conclude that @xmath53 do include the whole @xmath48 .",
    "thus , neither of the fronts is superluminal . in this sense general relativity forbids superluminal signalling : _ the speed of gravity does not exceed the speed of light_.    the mentioned uniqueness theorems for solutions of the einstein equations are proved under some  physically reasonable \" assumptions on the properties of their right hand sides . in particular , three such assumptions are formulated in @xcite .",
    "the first of them is essentially the condition that the | duly defined | speed of ",
    "matter signals \" does not exceed the speed of light , the second one is a stability requirement , and the third one restricts the stress - energy tensors to expressions polynomial in @xmath54 ( the corresponding restriction in @xcite allows also first - order derivatives of the metric ) .",
    "this last assumption is _ known _ to fail in many physically interesting situations . in particular ,",
    "vacuum polarization _ typically _ leads to appearance of terms with second - order derivatives of the metric ( like the ricci tensor ) in the right hand side of the einstein equations , see @xcite .",
    "so , one can expect that the gravitational signals may propagate faster than light on the horizon of a black hole , where semi - classical effects are strong .",
    "an important dissimilarity between the concepts of the matter field signal and the front is that a single event is associated with _",
    "one _ signal , but _ two _ fronts and the latter do not have to be superluminal both _ at once_.    definition an alternative is called _ superluminal _ , if both fronts are superluminal and _ semi - superluminal _ if so is only one .",
    "consider a world @xmath6 where a photon ( or some other _ test _ particle ) is sent from the earth ( the event @xmath55 ) to arrive to a distant star at some moment @xmath56 ( @xmath57 parametrizes the world line of the star ) .",
    "let , further , @xmath7 be the world which was initially the same as @xmath6 , but in which a huge spaceship is sent to the star instead of the photon ( the start of the spaceship is @xmath58 ) . on its way to the star the spaceship warps and tears the spacetime by exploding passing stars , merging binary black holes and otherwise employing immense energies and matter with little understood properties .",
    "if the causality principle ( by which the assertion is understood that the speed of matter field signals does not exceed the speed of light ) holds in @xmath7 , the spaceship arrives at the star later than the photon emitted in @xmath58 , but nevertheless it is imaginable that its arrival time @xmath59 is _ less _ than @xmath56 ( so , the speed of light in one world does not restrict the speed of the spaceship in the other ) .",
    "indeed , the assumed prohibition of superluminal signalling in @xmath6 does not prevent @xmath60 from being spacelike , because @xmath60 does not correspond to any matter field signal ( the world line of the spaceship does _ not _ belong to @xmath60 ) .",
    "the pair @xmath12 is an example of what we have called the semi - superluminal alternative . in a theory admitting the alternatives of this kind faster - than -",
    "light trips do not require violations of the causality principle .",
    "example[ex : hyperj ] let @xmath6 be the minkowski plane and @xmath55 be the point with the coordinates @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "let , further , @xmath7 be the spacetime obtained by removing the segments @xmath63 $ ] , @xmath64 , from the minkowski plane , see the figure , and gluing the left / right bank of either cut to the right / left bank of the other one .    .",
    "the arrowed thick line depicts[fig : hyperj ] a continuous timelike curve .",
    "the dashed lines show where the banks of the former cuts are glued together , the gray region is @xmath65 . ]",
    "then @xmath23 is the complement to the union of two future cones with the vertices at the points @xmath66 . that @xmath23 is maximal indeed is clear from the fact that otherwise being a past set it would contain a past directed timelike curve @xmath67 terminating at one of the vertices , while @xmath68 does not have a past end point due to the singularity .",
    "obviously @xmath69 in this case , so the front @xmath60 is superluminal",
    ". however , in the ( empty ) spacetime @xmath6 the surface @xmath60 does not correspond to any matter field signal , so its superluminal character does not violate the causality principle . at the same time @xmath70 is not superluminal ( and so ,",
    "the alternative @xmath12 is semi - superluminal ) . even though the spaceship arrives to its destination",
    "sooner than the photon in @xmath6 does ( @xmath71 ) it does not outrun the photons in @xmath7 , so the causality principle holds there too .",
    "the spacetime @xmath7 is singular ( though the singularity is absolutely mild ) .",
    "so , one may wonder if the whole effect is related to this fact .",
    "indeed , the assumption that both spacetimes in an alternative are globally hyperbolic makes the prohibition of superluminal and semi - superluminal alternatives equally strong .",
    "proposition[prop : hot1 ] a semi - superluminal alternative @xmath12 is superluminal if both @xmath6 and @xmath7 are globally hyperbolic .",
    "( the proof is rather technical and will be published elsewhere ) .",
