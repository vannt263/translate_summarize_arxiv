    "random walks on regular and homogeneous structures have well been investigated in the past studies @xcite . however , it has been found that real networks such as world wide web and internet , to name a few , possess a random and heterogeneous structure @xcite .",
    "degree distribution in these networks usually exhibits a power law behavior as @xmath1 , where usually @xmath2 lies between @xmath3 and @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 denotes the node s degree ( number of neighbors )",
    ".    the network structure can significantly affect the behavior of a random walker on it @xcite .",
    "for instance , if a network has an effectively infinite dimension ( as happens for real networks ) , then the number of visited nodes by a random walker may increase linearly with the number of time steps @xcite . as another example , we know that it is easier to find a target in some kinds of small - world networks @xcite . on the other hand , for a fixed structure one may change the dynamics rules to find better strategies to locate the target . indeed , it has been shown that intermittent walks could give a greater efficiency than usual simple random walks in homogeneous structures @xcite . in this work",
    "we will introduce an intermittent random walk and study its behavior on a random network of scale - free degree distribution .",
    "we will see how the cover times ( to visit all the nodes or edges ) change with the network structure and the random walk dynamics .    consider an explorer that starts its exploration from an arbitrary page in www .",
    "the explorer usually goes through a shortcut to another web page linked in the first one .",
    "she might do the same in the new page or log off the web .",
    "usually , one does the exploration for a limited time @xmath0 and the next time starts the exploration from another page .",
    "this behavior of an explorer can be modeled by an intermittent random walk on the www network .",
    "here @xmath0 controls the random walk intermittency . for very small @xmath0 , random long - range jumps",
    "dominate the walk , and if @xmath0 is very large one recovers the usual random walk behavior .",
    "let the above intermittent explorer walk on a given network .",
    "we can ask the following questions : how long does it take for the explorer to cover all the nodes / edges in the network ? there exist nodes of very different degrees in a heterogeneous network . how fast are nodes of different degrees , or edges connecting nodes of given degrees , visited by the above explorer ? after a time the explorer covers a portion of the original network .",
    "looking at this visited part we could obtain an estimate of the degree distribution . in the case of scale - free networks ,",
    "we ask how much the estimated exponent of degree distribution is close to the original one .",
    "a similar question has recently been asked for other quantities of a network such as clustering and average degree in ref .",
    "but , in that study the explorer is a random walker with no random long - range jumps , i.e. , @xmath6 .    in the following we are going to address some of the above questions in a scale - free network .",
    "we will see that heterogeneity and degree correlations between neighboring nodes have significant effects on the behavior of the explorer .",
    "interestingly , we find that there is an optimal value of @xmath0 that minimizes the edge s cover time .",
    "this behavior originates from the heterogeneous structure of the network .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : first we define more exactly the model and networks that are studied in this work .",
    "then we discuss the results of numerical simulations .",
    "a summary of the results and some concluding remarks are given in the conclusion .",
    "consider a given network and a random explorer that starts from an arbitrary node at time step @xmath7 . then , for the next @xmath0 time steps the explorer does a simple random walk . in a simple random",
    "walk the walker just performs random local jumps ; i.e. at each time step the explorer selects , with equal probability , one of the neighbors of the node visited at the previous time step . at the end of this simple random walk , i.e. at time step @xmath8",
    ", the explorer jumps instantaneously to a randomly selected node in the network and again does a simple random walk for the next @xmath0 steps .",
    "this process may continue for @xmath9 time steps . here",
    "@xmath10 indexes the number of simple walks and @xmath11 counts the number of steps in the current simple walk .",
    "notice that long - range jumps occur instantaneously and @xmath12 gives the number of local jumps along the edges of the network . in general one can also assign a time @xmath13 to the long - range jumps .",
    "here we are only interested in the effects induced by the network structure and so we will take @xmath14 .",
    "we call the above walk an intermittent random walk .",
    "it is clear that one recovers the usual random walk by approaching @xmath0 to infinity . on the other hand , if @xmath15 the walker just performs random long - range jumps . in this case , by definition we have @xmath7 and no edge of the network is visited at all .    at any time step @xmath12 of the walk",
    "we can define the fraction of visited nodes and edges that are denoted by @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "we define the edge s cover time @xmath18 as the number of necessary time steps to visit all edges . this time step is larger than or equal to @xmath19 , the time step at which all nodes have been visited .",
    "looking at the visited nodes and edges , the explorer finds an estimated degree distribution of the network , denoted by @xmath20 .",
    "the estimated exponent of the degree distribution , @xmath21 , is extracted from the behavior of @xmath20 for large @xmath5 s .",
    "we are going to study the above random walk on scale - free networks of fixed degree distribution possessing different kinds of degree correlations .",
    "we start with the network model introduced by barabsi and albert ( ba model ) @xcite ; it is a growth model where nodes of degree @xmath22 are successively added to the network . each edge of the new node is connected with probability @xmath23 to a node of degree @xmath24 already present in the network .",
    "this preferential attachment of the edges results in a scale - free degree distribution , @xmath25 , for sufficiently large number of nodes . here",
    "we will consider networks of size @xmath26 .    generating good scale - free networks with small exponent @xmath2 is not a trivial task especially when @xmath27 is not very large . indeed for @xmath28",
    "the second moment of degree distribution diverges in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this in turn results to large fluctuations in the tail of degree distribution for small @xmath27 .",
    "it is why we selected a scale - free network with the relatively large exponent @xmath29 .",
    "however , as we will see , the main result of this study originates from the heterogeneous structure of the network . therefore we expect to find , qualitatively , similar results for smaller values of @xmath2 .",
    "there is a little tendency for nodes of dissimilar degree to be connected to each other in the above network model .",
    "the correlation coefficient gives a measure of this tendency and is defined as @xcite @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the probability of having an edge with end point nodes of degree @xmath32 ; @xmath33 is the number of such edges in the network and @xmath34 is the total number of edges .",
    "the probability of finding a node of degree @xmath5 at the end of an edge is @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the average degree . in uncorrelated networks",
    "@xmath37 and so @xmath38 .",
    "for assortative and disassortative networks we have @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    ".correlation coefficient of the networks studied in this work .",
    "the networks size is @xmath26 .",
    "the correlated and uncorrelated networks have been obtained from ba model as described in the text .",
    "the initial seed for growing ba model was a pair of connected nodes and @xmath41 .",
    "statistical errors are less than @xmath42 and @xmath43 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to generate networks of different correlations we go through the following instruction @xcite : starting from an arbitrary node , say @xmath44 , we randomly select one of its neighbors @xmath45 .",
    "then the edge between them is replaced by another one that connects @xmath45 to a randomly selected node @xmath46 , which is not already a neighbor of @xmath45 .",
    "we set @xmath47 and again go through the above process . repeating the process for a large number of times , @xmath48 , results in nearly uncorrelated networks . to generate disassortative networks we connect @xmath45 and @xmath46 only when @xmath49 , otherwise neglect @xmath46 and select another node .",
    "if we are to generate assortative networks we connect @xmath45 and @xmath46 with probability @xmath50^{1.5}$ ] . in table",
    "[ tab.1 ] we have given the correlation coefficients for networks that are studied in this work .",
    "first , let us see what happens for the intermittent random walker on an uncorrelated random network of degree distribution @xmath51 .",
    "for such a network , the probability of finding the walker on a node of degree @xmath5 after a random long - range jump is just @xmath51 .",
    "consider a node of degree @xmath5 in the network .",
    "we define @xmath52 as the the probability of finding the walker on this node at time @xmath12 . if @xmath15 then @xmath53 . in this case",
    "the walker does not differ between nodes of different degree and so all nodes are visited with the same rate . on the other hand , for @xmath6",
    "the walker has more chance to be found on a node of high degree .",
    "for very large @xmath12 we have @xmath54 and for small @xmath12 we expect @xmath55 to grow even faster than @xmath5 . now , high degree nodes are visited more rapidly and low degree nodes are visited rarely .",
    "indeed , any deviation from @xmath15 decreases / increases the rate of visiting low / high degree nodes .",
    "usually a significant fraction of the nodes have a low degree and so one expects the node s cover time to be an increasing function of @xmath0 .",
    "now consider an edge that connects two nodes of degree @xmath5 and @xmath56 to each other .",
    "again we define @xmath57 as the probability of visiting the edge at time step @xmath12 . as stated before the case @xmath15 is trivial because all edges remain unvisited and so the edge s cover time is infinity .",
    "however , when @xmath58 we have    @xmath59    we see that the probability of visiting an edge with end point nodes of high degree is very small . in the case of a scale - free network , after a long - range jump the walker usually finds itself on a low degree node . and",
    "if @xmath0 is very small the walker would not have enough time to visit edges that connect high degree nodes .",
    "this in turn results to a large cover time for the edges . on the other hand , when @xmath6    @xmath60    if @xmath52 grows faster than @xmath5 ( we have numerically checked that it is indeed the case ) then the edges connecting low degree nodes have a very small chance to be visited by the walker . in this case",
    "the walker usually visits the edges connecting high degree nodes .",
    "therefore , the walker would need a large time to cover the entire set of the edges .",
    "let us find an expression for @xmath52 when @xmath6 .",
    "the probability of finding the walker on a node of degree @xmath5 is given by @xmath61 .",
    "however , if we restrice ourselves to the set of visited nodes at time step @xmath12 , then we can write    @xmath62    here @xmath63 is the total number of visited nodes and @xmath64 denotes the number of visited nodes of degree @xmath5 . the average degree @xmath65 is given by @xmath66 . in a mean field approximation , we have    @xmath67    where @xmath68 is the probability that the new visited node is visited for the first time . in this way",
    "we obtain    @xmath69    and for @xmath52 we find    @xmath70    we see that even in a mean field approximation @xmath52 increases faster than @xmath5 for any finite value of @xmath12 .",
    "the above arguments suggest that there may exist an optimal @xmath0 that minimizes the edge s cover time . in the following we resort to numerical simulations to see what happens for intermediate values of @xmath0 and different network structures .",
    "first we study how @xmath71 and @xmath72 behave with @xmath0 for some fixed value of @xmath12 .",
    "figure [ f1 ] shows the results of numerical simulations for these quantities .",
    "we see that @xmath71 always decreases with @xmath0 , and except for small @xmath0 s , the explorer visits a smaller number of nodes in assortative networks .",
    "in fact , for a large @xmath0 the walk is mostly limited to the core of high degree nodes .",
    "so the explorer would miss the other nodes which make a major part of the network .     at two times @xmath73 ( left ) and @xmath74 ( right ) .",
    "in all the figures the parameters are the same as those of table [ tab.1].,width=566 ]    as fig . [ f1 ] shows , the situation is more interesting for the fraction of visited edges .",
    "while at small times @xmath72 decreases with @xmath0 , for larger times it develops a maximum at some intermediate value of @xmath0 . this phenomenon is clearer in the assortative networks .",
    "the presence of a maximum in @xmath72 brings the hope to have a minimum @xmath18 for some @xmath0 .",
    "figure [ f2 ] shows the cover times @xmath75 and @xmath76 versus @xmath0 .",
    "the results for different kinds of degree correlations have been compared in this figure . as expected , in all cases",
    "@xmath77 increases monotonically with @xmath0 .",
    "there are points at which increasing @xmath0 does not result to any change in @xmath77 . in this case",
    "@xmath0 is large enough for the explorer to have the chance to visit different parts of the network .",
    "moreover , as fig .",
    "[ f2 ] shows , the assortative networks display this saturation phenomenon at a larger @xmath0 , and again this is due to the presence of a core of high degree nodes in those networks . in a disassortative network a community of nodes is usually formed by some low degree nodes gathering around a high degree one .",
    "these communities are usually connected to each other by a few edges .",
    "a characteristic time here is the time the random walker needs for escaping a typical community .",
    "if @xmath0 is greater than this time , the walker behaves as if it had more random jumps during its walk .",
    "( left ) and @xmath78 ( right ) vs @xmath0 .",
    "inset ( left ) : @xmath79 and @xmath80 refer to small - world and smallest small - world networks , respectively .",
    "the number of nodes and shortcuts are @xmath26 and @xmath81 respectively .",
    "statistical errors are about a few percent.,width=566 ]    in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] we also observe the behavior of @xmath78 with @xmath0 . as expected , we find that in a scale - free network there is an optimal @xmath0 for covering the edges , and hence the whole network .",
    "this phenomenon is more prominent in the assortative networks .",
    "when @xmath0 is very small the explorer mostly visits the edges emanating from the low degree nodes which have more chance to be selected as the starting points of the simple random walks . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath0 is very large , most of the time is spent on already visited edges in the core of high degree nodes where the explorer is found most of the time .    in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] we also see that the optimal @xmath0 is greater for the assortative networks .",
    "in fact , in disassortative networks the explorer reaches a high degree node in a few steps after starting a simple random walk .",
    "the time to reach a high degree node would be larger in assortative networks where low degree nodes are more likely to be connected to each other .    to show that the observed non monotonic behavior of @xmath78 is indeed a heterogeneity - induced phenomenon , we obtained @xmath78 for two other networks : the small - world network @xcite and the smallest small - world network @xcite .",
    "the former network , which is a homogeneous one , is constructed by adding randomly @xmath82 shortcuts to a chain of @xmath27 nodes .",
    "the latter network , which is not homogeneous , is constructed by adding @xmath82 shortcuts , but this time emanating from a single node on the chain and distributed randomly throughout the network . as the inset in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] shows , in the small - world network @xmath78 increases monotonically with @xmath0 whereas it exhibits a minimum in the smallest small - world network .",
    "finally we look at the estimated exponent of degree distribution by the explorer . at a given time @xmath12",
    "we construct a network of visited nodes and edges .",
    "the estimated degree distribution @xmath20 is obtained from the constructed network . then we fit a power law function @xmath83 to the tail of this distribution .",
    "we use only the data in the range @xmath84 $ ] where @xmath85 is the maximum degree that appears in @xmath20",
    ". then the estimated @xmath2 is obtained by a maximum likelihood procedure @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] we plot the estimated exponent versus @xmath86 for @xmath87 and @xmath6 . there , we have compared the results for the assortative and disassortative networks with @xmath88 .",
    "this exponent has been obtained for the original network with the same procedure described above .",
    "figure [ f3 ] shows that at short times the estimated exponent is larger than the original one in both the assortative and disassortative networks . for @xmath87 and small @xmath12 ,",
    "the fraction of visited edges is small and most of them are incident on low degree nodes .",
    "the probability of having a high degree node is very small and so the visited network seems more homogeneous than the original one . in this limit",
    "the estimated @xmath2 is much larger in the assortative networks .",
    "this stems from the fact that the assortative networks are locally more homogeneous than the disassortative ones . as fig .",
    "[ f3 ] shows , the scenario changes in long times .",
    "we have an underestimate of the exponent in the assortative networks and still an overestimate in the disassortative ones . for large times",
    "the new visited edges mostly connect high degree nodes in the assortative networks .",
    "consequently , the fraction of high degree nodes in the visited network rapidly increases .",
    "notice that in the disassortative networks the new visited edges usually connect dissimilar nodes and so we have a uniform approach to the real structure of the network .",
    "vs time for @xmath87 ( left ) and @xmath6 ( right ) .",
    "statistical errors are of order @xmath89.,width=566 ]    in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] we see that for @xmath6 the estimated exponent is always greater than the original one . here",
    ", there is no significant difference between the values of @xmath21 in the assortative and disassortative networks . comparing the two cases @xmath87 and @xmath6",
    ", we see that in the disassortative networks the estimated exponent approaches the real value with nearly the same rate . on an assortative network",
    "the explorer finds a better estimate of @xmath2 if it has a simple random walk with no long - range jumps .",
    "in summary , we showed that there is an optimal @xmath0 that minimizes the cover time @xmath18 in a scale - free network .",
    "the optimal @xmath0 increases with the degree of assortativity in the network .",
    "this non monotonic behavior of @xmath18 with @xmath0 originates from the heterogeneous structure of the network .",
    "therefore , we expect that increasing ( decreasing ) @xmath2 will weaken ( strengthen ) the observed effect .",
    "depending on the nature of degree correlations in the network we could obtain an overestimate or underestimate of the exponent @xmath2 .",
    "the findings might be useful in devising good strategies to cover a heterogeneous network and find a good estimate of the network s structure .",
    "it will be interesting to study more realistic cases where @xmath0 obeys a given distribution .",
    "we have numerically checked that the non monotonic behavior of @xmath18 is also observed when @xmath0 follows an exponential distribution .",
    "the above results are also qualitatively true for other values of @xmath22 , or the average degree . moreover , the optimal @xmath0 is not very sensitive to the size of network , @xmath27 .",
    "for instance , if we increase @xmath27 form @xmath90 to @xmath91 , the optimal @xmath0 decreases nearly by @xmath3 . in this study we considered the case",
    "that long - rang jumps occur instantaneously , i.e. @xmath14 . the way that the covering times behave with @xmath0 depends also on the magnitude of this quantity .",
    "clearly , for very large @xmath92 , both @xmath19 and @xmath18 will decrease with @xmath0 ."
