    "electromagnetic radiation is intrinsically quantum mechanical in nature .",
    "nevertheless it has been found extremely fruitful , at both conceptual and practical levels , to designate certain states of quantised radiation as being essentially `` classical '' , and others as being `` non - classical ''  @xcite .",
    "it is the latter that show the specific quantum features of radiation most sharply .",
    "some of the well known signs of nonclassicality in this context are quadrature squeezing  @xcite , antibunching  @xcite and subpoissonian photon statistics  @xcite .",
    "the purposes of this paper are to present a new physically equivalent way of distinguishing classical from nonclassical states of radiation , dual to the customary definition and based on operator properties ; to point out the existence of several levels of classical behaviour , with a structure that gets progressively more elaborate as the number of modes increases ; and finally to give a complete discussion of signatures of nonclassical photon statistics for two - mode fields , working at the level of fluctuations in photon numbers .",
    "the contents of this paper are arranged as follows in section ii we develop a criterion based on operator expectation values , to distinguish between classical and nonclassical states of radiation .",
    "the basic idea is that the normal ordering rule of correspondence between classical dynamical variables and quantum operators , while being linear and translating reality into hermiticity , does not respect positivity .",
    "if this potential nonpositivity does not show up in the expectation values of operators in a certain state , then that state is classical ; otherwise it is nonclassical .",
    "section iii explores this new approach further and shows that , as the number of independent modes increases , the classification of quantum states gets progressively finer ; several levels of nonclassicality emerge .",
    "this is shown in detail for one and two mode fields , and then the trend becomes clear .",
    "section iv analyses in complete detail the properties of two mode photon number fluctuations , stressing the freedom to choose any normalised linear combination of the originally given modes as a variable single mode .",
    "the well known mandel parameter criterion  @xcite for sub - poissonian statistics for a single mode field is extended in full generality to a matrix inequality in the two - mode case .",
    "it is shown that certain consequences of this inequality transcend the set of all single mode projections of it , and are thus intrinsically two - mode in character .",
    "explicit physically interesting examples of this situation are provided , and the well known pair coherent states are also examined from this point of view .",
    "section v presents some concluding remarks .",
    "we deal for simplicity with states of a single mode radiation field , though our arguments generalise immediately to any number of modes .",
    "the photon creation and annihilation operators @xmath0 and @xmath1 obey the customary commutation relation @xmath2 \\equiv \\hat{a}\\;\\hat{a}^{\\dag } - \\hat{a}^{\\dag}\\;\\hat{a}=1\\cdot\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the coherent states @xmath3 are right eigenstates of @xmath1 with ( a generally complex ) eigenvalue @xmath4 ; they are related to the states @xmath5 of definite photon number ( eigenstates of @xmath6 ) in the standard way : @xmath7 a general ( pure or mixed ) state of the one - mode field is described by a corresponding normalised density matrix @xmath8 : @xmath9 it can be expanded in the so - called diagonal coherent state representation  @xcite : @xmath10 while hermiticity of @xmath8 corresponds to reality of the weight function @xmath11 , the latter is in general a singular mathematical quantity , namely a distribution of a well - defined class .",
    "the conventional designation of @xmath8 as being classical or nonclassical is based on the properties of @xmath11 .",
    "namely , @xmath8 is said to be classical if @xmath11 is everywhere non - negative and not more singular than a delta function  @xcite : @xmath12 it is clear that the conditions to be classical involve an infinite number of independent inequalities , since @xmath13 has to be obeyed at each point @xmath4 in the complex plane . this is true despite the fact that the condition @xmath14 means that the `` values '' of @xmath11 at different points @xmath4 are not quite `` independent '' .",
    "one realises this by recalling that every classical probability distribution over the complex plane is certainly a possible choice for @xmath11 , with the corresponding @xmath8 being classical .    the above familiar definition of classical states deals directly with @xmath8 and @xmath11 .",
    "now we develop a dual , but equivalent , definition based on operators and their expectation values .",
    "as is well known , the representation  ( [ diag - coh - def ] ) for @xmath8 is closely allied to the normal ordering rule for passing from classical c - number dynamical variables to quantum operators . within quantum mechanics we know that an operator @xmath15 is completely and uniquely determined by its diagonal coherent state matrix elements ( expectation values ) @xmath16 . moreover , hermiticity of @xmath15 and reality of @xmath16 are precisely equivalent .",
    "any ( real ) classical function @xmath17 determines uniquely , by the normal ordering rule of placing @xmath0 always to the left of @xmath1 after substituting @xmath18 and @xmath19 , a corresponding ( hermitian ) operator @xmath20 as follows :    @xmath21 the connection with the representation  ( [ diag - coh - def ] ) for @xmath8 is given by @xmath22 it is an important property of the normal ordering rule that , while it translates classical reality to quantum hermiticity , _ it does not preserve positive semidefiniteness_. more explicitly , while by eq .",
    "( [ norm - order ] ) @xmath23 implies @xmath24 , _ the converse is not true_. here are some simple examples of nonnegative classical real @xmath17 leading to indefinite hermitian @xmath20 : @xmath25    in the last example , the real constants @xmath26 can certainly be chosen so that some of them are negative while maintaining @xmath24 ; this results in @xmath20 being indefinite .",
    "we thus see that when the normal ordering rule is used , every @xmath23 arises from a unique @xmath24 , but some ( real ) @xmath24 lead to ( hermitian ) indefinite @xmath20 .",
    "so in a given quantum state @xmath8 , the operator @xmath20 corresponding to a nonnegative real classical @xmath17 could well have a negative expectation value . _ if this never happens , then @xmath8 is classical_. that is , as we see upon combining eqns .",
    "(  [ diag - coh - nonc - cond ] )  ( [ expect - diagcoh ] ) : if for every @xmath24 the corresponding @xmath20 has a nonnegative expectation value even though @xmath20 may be indefinite , then @xmath8 is classical .",
    "conversely , @xmath8 is nonclassical if there is at least one @xmath24 which leads to an indefinite @xmath20 whose expectation value is negative .",
    "we can convey the content of this dual operator way of defining classical states also as follows : while the normal ordering rule allows for the appearance of `` negativity '' in an operator @xmath20 even when none is present in the corresponding classical @xmath17 , in a classical state such negativity never shows up in expectation values .",
    "purely by way of contrast , we compare the above with what obtains when the antinormal ordering rule - substituting @xmath27 followed by placing @xmath1 to the left , @xmath0 to the right - is used to pass from classical @xmath17 to quantum @xmath15  @xcite . in place of eqns .",
    "(  [ norm - order ] )  ( [ expect - diagcoh ] ) we have :    @xmath28 now the situation is that @xmath24 certainly implies @xmath29 , but some @xmath29 arise from indefinite classical @xmath17 .",
    "a simple example is : @xmath30 thus the function and operator relationships are opposite to what we found in the normal ordering case .",
    "the direct characterization of classical states ( whose definition in any case is a convention based on the normal ordering rule ) is however not very convenient with the antinormal ordering convention .",
    "in passing we may note an interesting aspect of the weyl or symmetric rule of ordering  @xcite , and the associated wigner distribution description of a state @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "here it is more convenient to deal with the real and imaginary parts of @xmath4 and @xmath1 : @xmath31 = i\\;\\cdot \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the weyl ordering rule maps single classical exponentials into single operator exponentials , @xmath32 and then extends this by linearity and fourier transformation to general functions :    @xmath33 the wigner distribution @xmath34 for a state @xmath8 is given in terms of the configuration space matrix elements of @xmath8 : @xmath35 and the rule for expectation values ties together eqns .",
    "( [ weyl - rule ] )  ( [ wigner - function ] ) : @xmath36 from the algebraic point of view the weyl rule stands `` midway '' or symmetrically between the normal and the antinormal ordering rules .",
    "this may lead one to hope that it removes the mismatch and resolves the problem of preserving positivity in both directions in passing between @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "however this does not happen at all .",
    "as is well known there are nonnegative @xmath37 yielding indefinite @xmath38 , and nonnegative @xmath38 leading back to indefinite @xmath37 . here",
    "are simple examples : @xmath39    while these remarks illuminate in terms of operator properties the relations among the three ordering rules , the classification of states @xmath8 into classical and nonclassical ones is based most simply on the normal ordering rule .",
    "it is clear that all these considerations extend easily to any number of modes of radiation .    while our operator based approach to the identification of nonclassical states is conceptually complete , we note that most of the extant criteria of nonclassicality involve a simple extension of our formalism .",
    "namely , one often has to consider nonlinear functions of expectation values of several operators , which can not be simply expressed as the expectation value of a single state - independent or autonomous operator .",
    "this is always so when one deals with fluctuations .",
    "thus quadrature squeezed non - classical states are defined via inequalities involving the fluctuations @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "similarly amplitude squeezing or sub - poissonian statistics deals with the fluctuation in photon number .",
    "these remarks apply also to other criteria of non - classicality such as higher order squeezing  @xcite and the one based on matrices constructed out of factorial moments of the photon number distribution  @xcite .",
    "the one interesting exception to these remarks and which is fully covered by our formalism , is the case of antibunching  @xcite . here",
    "one is concerned with the expectation values of the single time - dependent operator @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the intensity operator at time @xmath44 . in this sense ,",
    "the criterion for antibunching is qualitatively different from the other familiar ones .",
    "we begin again with the single mode situation and hereafter deal exclusively with the normal ordering prescription .",
    "( therefore the subscript @xmath45 on @xmath20 will be omitted ) .",
    "suppose we limit ourselves to classical functions @xmath17 which are real , nonnegative and phase invariant , that is , invariant under @xmath46 .",
    "an independent and complete set of these can be taken to be @xmath47 since they map conveniently to the number state projection operators : @xmath48 a general real linear combination @xmath49 , even if nonnegative , may lead to an indefinite @xmath15 , as seen at eqn .",
    "( [ cl - positive - op - indef ] ) .",
    "if we are interested only in the expectation values of such variables , we are concerned only with the probabilities @xmath50 for finding various numbers of photons ; for this purpose an angular average of @xmath11 is all that is required : @xmath51 now while @xmath52 certainly implies @xmath53 , the converse is not true .",
    "thus one is led to a three - fold classification of quantum states @xmath8  @xcite : @xmath54 the previous definition  ( [ diag - coh - nonc - cond ] ) of nonclassical @xmath8 based on @xmath11 alone is now refined to yield two subsets of states , the semiclassical and the strongly nonclassical . the semiclassical states do have the following property : @xmath55 however , in addition , there would definitely be some phase noninvariant @xmath24 for which @xmath15 is indefinite and @xmath56 .",
    "it is just that this extent of nonclassicality in @xmath8 is not revealed by the expectation values of phase invariant variables , or at the level of the probabilities @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the classification  ( [ cl - semicl - noncl ] ) is @xmath57 or phase invariant .",
    "that is , @xmath58 retains its classical , semiclassical or strongly non - classical character under the transformation @xmath59    as examples of interesting inequalities obeyed if @xmath8 is either classical or semiclassical , we may quote the following involving the factorial moments of the photon number probabilities @xmath50 : @xmath60 violation of any one of these inequalities implies @xmath8 is strongly nonclassical .    the inequalities quoted in eq .",
    "( [ two - mode - defns - i ] ) above clearly involve an infinite subset of the photon number probabilities @xmath50 .",
    "however one can easily construct far simpler inequalities involving a small number of the @xmath50 s , violation of any of which also implies that @xmath58 is strongly non - classical .",
    "for example , from eqs .",
    "( [ cl - fn - examp ] )  ( [ cl - fn - examp - op ] ) , for any nonnegative integer @xmath61 and any real @xmath62 we have the correspondence @xmath63 here @xmath64 is nonnegative while @xmath65 is indefinite if @xmath66 .",
    "we then have the result : @xmath67 so again , violation of any of these `` local '' inequalities in @xmath68 implies that @xmath58 is strongly nonclassical .    a physically illuminating example of the distinction between classical and semiclassical @xmath58 , and passage from one to the other , is provided by the case of the kerr medium .",
    "the argument is intricate and rests on two well known results .",
    "the first is hudson s theorem  @xcite  : if a ( purestate ) wavefunction @xmath69 has a nonnegative wigner function @xmath70 , then @xmath69 is gaussian and conversely ; in that case @xmath71 is also gaussian .",
    "the second result is the general connection between @xmath72 and @xmath73 for any @xmath58 : @xmath74 this means that for classical @xmath75 with @xmath76 , @xmath77 as well .",
    "now imagine a single mode radiation field in an initial coherent state @xmath78 with @xmath79 , incident upon a kerr medium  @xcite .",
    "this initial state is pure , classical , and has a gaussian wave function @xmath69 .",
    "the kerr medium hamiltonian is of the form @xmath80 clearly the number states @xmath81 are eigenstates of this hamiltonian .",
    "therefore the poissonian photon number distribution @xmath82 of the input state @xmath83 is preserved under passage through the kerr medium .",
    "likewise the funtion @xmath84 is left unaltered .",
    "therefore the output state @xmath85 , which of course is pure , is either classical or semiclassical .",
    "however the form of @xmath86 shows that the output wavefunction is non gaussian .",
    "therefore by hudson s theorem the corresponding @xmath73 must become negative somewhere . therefore by eq .",
    "( [ kerr - wigner ] ) the output @xmath72 can not be nonnegative .",
    "thus passage through the kerr medium converts an incident coherent state , which is classical , into a final state which is semiclassical .",
    "now we sketch the extension of these ideas to the two - mode case . here",
    "the operator commutation relations , number and coherent states , and the diagonal representation for @xmath8 , are as follows : @xmath87 & = & \\delta_{rs},\\;[\\hat{a}_r,\\hat{a}_s ] = [ \\hat{a}_r^{\\dag},\\hat{a}^{\\dag}_s]=0,\\quad r,\\;s=1,\\;2\\;;\\nonumber \\\\",

    "does not require complete knowledge of @xmath110 but only of a partly angle averaged quantity @xmath111 : @xmath112 it is clear that these moments @xmath107 involve more than just the photon number probabilities @xmath113 which are just the `` diagonal '' case of the general matrix element in eqn .",
    "( [ examp - rho - matelements ] ) : @xmath114 this is the two - mode version of eqn .",
    "( [ prob - i ] ) .",

    "( in particular , for these , the probabilities @xmath113 are inadequate ) .",
    "when this is done we see the need to deal with both the quantities @xmath119 derived from @xmath110 by a single or a double angular average .",
    "one can therefore distinguish four levels of classicality for two - mode states : @xmath120 these definitions can be cast in dual operator forms . for example , for semi classical -i states , we can say that for any classical real nonnegative overall @xmath90 phase invariant @xmath121 the corresponding operator @xmath15 has a nonnegative expectation value , while this fails for some @xmath121 outside this class . in the semi - classical - ii case , we have to further limit @xmath121 to be real nonnegative and invariant under independent @xmath122 phase transformations in the two modes , to be sure that the expectation value of @xmath15 is nonnegative .",
    "at this point we can see that these levels of classicality possess different covariance groups . since under a general @xmath123 transformation @xmath124 ,",

    "thus one can see that each of the three properties of being semiclassical - i , semiclassical - ii or strongly non - classical is only @xmath132 invariant .    as the number of modes increases further , clearly",

    "part of the information contained in the matrix condition  ( [ the - inequality ] ) is thus irreducibly two - mode in character , a sample of this being : @xmath202    admittedly to a limited extent , this situation is analogous to some well known properties of wigner distributions .",
    "thus the marginal distributions in a single variable obtained by integrating @xmath73 with respect to @xmath203 or with respect to @xmath204 ( or any real linear combination of @xmath204 and @xmath203 ) are always nonnegative probability distributions , even though @xmath73 is in general indefinite .",
    "so also here , it can well happen that for a certain state both @xmath205 and @xmath206 are nonnegative for all @xmath207 , yet @xmath208 is indefinite .",
    "there exists in the literature a well known inequality for two - mode fields , which when violated is a sign of nonclassicality  @xcite .",
    "it reads : @xmath209 and evidently involves only diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath208 . after rearranging the operators in normal",
    "ordered form one can see that @xmath210 by our analysis , in any classical or semiclassical - i state the matix @xmath208 is positive semidefinite , so in particular @xmath211 and even more so the expression @xmath212 , are both nonnegative .",
    "thus the inequality  ( [ lee - ineq ] ) is certainly a necessary condition for classical and semiclassical - i states .",
    "conversely , if  ( [ lee - ineq ] ) is violated and @xmath213 is negative , then certainly @xmath211 is negative as well , and the state is either semiclassical - ii or strongly non - classical .",
    "however this condition is unnecessarily strong since it asks for @xmath211 to be less than @xmath214 ; as we have shown , even the weaker condition @xmath215 is sufficient to imply that the state is semiclassical - ii or strongly nonclassical .",
    "vice versa , our necessary condition @xmath216 for a classical state or semiclassical - i state is stronger than the condition  ( [ lee - ineq ] ) . in both directions , then , our conditions are sharper than the ones existing in the literature .",
    "we conclude this section by presenting a few examples bringing out the content of the matrix condition  ( [ the - inequality ] ) , in particular the possibility of its containing more information than all single - mode projections of it .    * : + these are simultaneous eigenstates of @xmath217 and @xmath218  @xcite : @xmath219 for @xmath220 these states are given by @xmath221^{1/2 } } \\vert n+q , n \\rangle\\ ] ] where @xmath222 is a normalisation constant .",
    "it is known that in these states the second mode already shows subpoissonian statistics  @xcite .",
    "thus if we write the matrix  ( [ the - a - matrix ] ) for these states as @xmath223 , then even without having to nontrivially mix the modes we find : @xmath224 the matrix @xmath225 is indefinite and the pair coherent states are therefore neither classical nor even semiclassical - i .",
    "consistent with this , a direct numerical study of the least eigenvalue @xmath226 of@xmath227 for sample values of @xmath228 and @xmath204 , does show it to be negative . *",
    ": it has been shown elsewhere  @xcite that a two mode squeezing transformation is characterised by two independent intrinsic squeeze parameters @xmath229 and @xmath230 obeying @xmath231 .",
    "a representative of such a transformation is @xmath232 } \\exp{\\left [ \\frac{(a+b)}{4}({\\hat{a}_2^{\\dagger 2}- \\hat{a}_2^{2 } } ) \\right]}.\\ ] ] the case @xmath233 essentially corresponds to the second mode alone being squeezed . for general @xmath234",
    "we have genuine two - mode squeezing ; while the ( caves - shumaker ) limit @xmath235 involves maximal entanglement of the two modes .",
    "we restrict our analysis to this limit in the sequel",
    ". then the two - mode squeezed vacuum is characterised by the single parameter @xmath229 and is @xmath236 \\vert 0,0 \\rangle   } \\label{sq - vac}\\ ] ] the matrix @xmath237 can be explicitly computed and happens to be diagonal : @xmath238 we see that for all @xmath239 this is indefinite , since the third eigenvalue @xmath240 is strictly negative .",
    "this is displayed in figure  1a , for @xmath229 in the range @xmath241 .",
    "thus for all @xmath242 the state  ( [ sq - vac ] ) is definitely neither classical nor semiclassical - i . on the other hand the leading diagonal element ( eigenvalue )",
    "@xmath243 dominates the others in the sense that for all choices of single mode the `` expectation value '' of @xmath244 is nonnegative : @xmath245 thus the squeezed vacuum  ( [ sq - vac ] ) displays nonclassicality via subpoissonian statistics in an intrinsic or irreducible two - mode sense which never shows up at the one mode level for any choice of that mode .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the case of pair - coherent states discussed previously . at the same time",
    "the state  ( [ sq - vac ] ) is also quadrature squeezed for all @xmath246 .",
    "thus both these nonclassical features are present simultaneously . * : this is defined as follows ( we again limit ourselves to the case @xmath235 ) : @xmath247},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at zero temperature @xmath248 this goes over to the previous example ( b ) .",
    "once again the matrix @xmath249 can be computed analytically and it turns out to be diagonal : @xmath250 now the third element @xmath251 can become negative for low enough temperature @xmath252 or high enough squeeze parameter @xmath229 . the variation of the least eigenvalue @xmath253 of @xmath254 with respect to @xmath229 in the range @xmath255 , for various choices of @xmath256 , is shown in figures  ( 1b , c , d ) .",
    "one can see that if the temperature is not too high , for sufficiently large @xmath229 the element @xmath251 becomes negative , indicating that the state has then become semi - classical - ii or strongly nonclassical .",
    "( in comparison we recall that for quadrature squeezing to set in the parameter @xmath229 must obey the inequality @xmath257  ( @xcite ) ) on the other hand as in example ( b ) , the leading element @xmath258 again dominates the others in the sense that @xmath259 so once again , when @xmath260 , the subpoissonian statistics is irreducibly two - mode in character . in figures  (",
    "1b , c , d ) we have also indicated the value of the squeeze parameter @xmath229 at which quadrature squeezing sets in .",
    "it is interesting to see that , for the states described here , at each temperature , the irreducible two - mode subpoissonian statistics occurs before squeezing .",
    "therefore ( limiting ourselves to low order moments of @xmath110 ) there exists a range of squeeze parameter where the only visible nonclassicality is through such subpoissonian statistics .",
    "+ the more general squeezed thermal state @xmath261 has qualitatively similar properties .",
    "detailed numerical studies presented elsewhere  @xcite have shown that these states also do not show subpoissonian statistics at the one - mode level .",
    "on the other hand , direct search for the least eigenvalue of @xmath262 reveals that , for suitable values of @xmath263 , this is negative .",
    "+ we thus have several instructive examples of the situation indicated by eq .",
    "( [ eq - one - mode ] )",
    "we have presented a dual operator and expectation value based approach to the problem of distinguishing classical from non - classical states of quantised radiation , and thus brought out the significance of this classification in a new physically interesting manner .",
    "as the number of independent modes increases , this approach leads to finer and yet finer levels of nonclassical behaviour , in a steady progression .",
    "this has been followed up by a complete analysis of photon number fluctuations for two - mode fields , and a comprehensive concept of subpoissonian statistics for such fields going beyond what can be handled by techniques developed at the one - mode level .    in a previous paper",
    "we have set up the formalism needed to examine the possibility of two - mode fields showing subpoissonian statistics at the one - mode level in an invariant manner , by following the variation of the mandel q - parameter as one continuously varies the combination of the two independent modes into a single mode .",
    "one can see through the work of the present paper that that preparatory analysis is a necessary prerequisite to be able to pinpoint the aspects of subpoissonian statistics which are irreducibly two - mode in character .",
    "examples ( b ) and ( c ) at the end of section iv bring out this aspect vividly .",
    "the inequality  ( [ lee - ineq ] ) has been strengthened by our approach to a sharper criterion to distinguish various situations : @xmath264 from eqns .",
    "( [ the - a - matrix ] ,  [ lee - ineq - eq ] ) we see that @xmath211 has the following neat expression : @xmath265 it is thus expressible solely in terms of expectations and fluctuations of the original ( unmixed ) mode number operators @xmath266 and their functions .",
    "one can now see easily , again from equation  ( [ the - a - matrix ] ) , that the statements  ( [ lee - repeat ] ) are part of a wider set of statements involving only expectations of functions of @xmath266 :        going back to the matrix @xmath271 , we see that from its properties we can not immediately distinguish between the classical and semiclassical - i situations , or between the semiclassical - ii and strongly non - classical situations . in",
    "both the former , @xmath272 is positive semidefinite ; while if @xmath272 is indefinite , one of the latter two must occur .",
    "it would be interesting , for pair coherent states or squeezed thermal states for instance , to be able to see , when @xmath272 is indefinite , whether we have a semi - classical - ii or a strongly non - classical state , and whether this depends on and varies with the parameters in the state .",
