    "we would like to start our chiral fits in the small mass region where they are simplest and most reliable .",
    "we could then include results for heavier masses and see when higher order terms in the expansion are required .",
    "instead , we have to apply our fits in a region where there may be large contributions from higher order terms . if our hadron masses are not very precise , or our range of quark mass is not very wide , a simple linear fit will be possible , but it may have little to do with the true low quark mass limit .",
    "the second complication is due to the fact that quenched chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath19 ) @xcite is different from ordinary chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath20 ) that applies to the real world @xcite .",
    "the differences between quenched and ordinary chiral perturbation theory are based on continuum rather than lattice calculations .",
    "the size of the additional terms is not well determined and they have not been clearly seen in the lattice results @xcite .",
    "the third complication involves possible systematic effects in fitting the hadron propagators .",
    "the propagators must not be fit too close to the source plane or we may not be in the asymptotic region .",
    "however , there is a strong inducement in terms of statistical accuracy to fit near the source plane . with the wall sources we use , and with gaussian sources of moderate size",
    ", the masses approach their asymptotic value from below .",
    "lighter mass channels can be fit closer to the source plane because the heavier states decay away relatively more quickly ; however , we must try to guard against systematic bias ( from fitting too close to the source ) that would make the hadron masses drop too quickly as the quark mass decreases .",

    "in fact , no three points can be adequately fit by a straight line .",

    "we note that different fitting functions can give widely varying values .",

    "we have a great deal of analysis to do to extract the hadron masses .",
    "since we have six different quark masses and propagators with non - degenerate quarks , we hope that we will be able to better elucidate the chiral limit than we were able to do for the ks quarks .",
