    "symmetries are of fundamental interest in all fields of physics . in linear irreversible transport",
    "the onsager - casimir @xcite symmetry relations are important since they relate different transport coefficients . here",
    "we are concerned with electron transport on the mesoscopic scale .",
    "this scale emerges when the distance carriers can travel without losing their phase coherence becomes comparable to the dimensions of the sample .",
    "it has long been understood that the onsager - casimir relations are not restricted to the macroscopic domain but extend to linear transport on the mesoscopic scale . for the linear conductance @xmath0",
    "onsager - casimir implies that under field reversal we have the symmetry @xmath1 .",
    "an important condition is that voltages are measured at contacts which are sufficiently large such that they can effectively be considered as equilibrium electron reservoirs@xcite .    since symmetries are important it is crucial to understand their limit of validity .",
    "are onsager - casimir relations strictly valid only in the linear transport regime ? what could cause their breakdown ?",
    "is it possible to quantify and measure the departure from symmetry ? in this work we report recent theoretical and experimental progress on these questions using as an example electron transport through a chaotic quantum dot .",
    "we extend earlier discussions to correlations of current non - linearity in voltage measured at different magnetic fields and temperatures .",
    "interestingly , as we will now discuss , these questions are related to the role coulomb interactions play in non - linear transport .    in the mesoscopic regime",
    "the linear conductance depends on quantum interference @xcite and depends on coulomb interactions .",
    "a change in the hartree potential is similar to a small change in the shape of the sample or in its impurity configuration and thus needs no separate discussion .",
    "in contrast hartree - fock terms @xcite can modify the conductance significantly .",
    "a well known example of such an interaction effect is the physics of coulomb blockade which becomes relevant at low temperatures if the contacts are pinched - off .",
    "however , if the conductance of the quantum dot with ballistic contacts is large , @xmath2 , fock terms give only a small relative correction @xmath3 to sample - specific quantum fluctuations . in such open dots",
    "weak localization corrections ( wl ) or universal conductance fluctuations ( ucf ) remain universal at low temperatures . in particular , coulomb interactions do not affect wl and just slightly ( @xmath3 ) modify ucf only at elevated temperatures @xcite . since these effects due to many - body physics in open quantum dots appear only as small corrections to non - interacting theory , one could conclude that coulomb interaction effects are unimportant .    however , coulomb interactions play a much more important role in non - linear transport .",
    "experimentally transport is characterized by the _ full _ conductance @xmath4 rather then the differential conductance , @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , here we are interested in @xmath6 ( at @xmath7 ) which we call the second - order non - linear conductance or simply the non - linear conductance . in this regime",
    "it is the coulomb interaction that breaks the symmetry of the onsager - casismir relations .",
    "conversely , measurement of transport non - linearity provides a tool to determine interactions .",
    "initial discussions of non - linear dc- transport @xcite and the rectification of an ac - applied voltage @xcite in mesoscopic samples were addressed without taking interaction effects into account .",
    "interestingly , inclusion of coulomb interaction does not only modify these phenomena but also leads to a qualitatively new effect : namely , even in a two terminal conductor it is possible to have a component to the current which is odd in magnetic field @xmath8 . in generic mesoscopic conductors , in chaotic cavities ( quantum dots ) and in metallic diffusive conductors",
    "this effect vanishes when an average is taken over many samples of slightly different geometry or impurity configuration ( mesoscopic averaging ) @xcite .",

    "@xcite they found the dependence of the fluctuation of the antisymmetric component on the interaction strength and the dependence on the number of ballistic channels transmitted through the contacts of the cavity .",
    "spivak and zyusin explored this asymmetry at small fields , @xmath11 , and weak interactions in open diffusive samples @xcite . under these conditions the asymmetric fluctuations are linear in flux and interaction strength .",
    "polianski and bttiker @xcite present a theory which describes the entire crossover from the regime of low magnetic fields to the regime considered in ref . in which the flux through the sample is comparable to a flux quantum @xmath12 .    the experiments measured field asymmetry in a wide range of structures : in nanotubes @xcite , ballistic billiards @xcite , ballistic quantum dots @xcite , ballistic @xcite and diffusive @xcite aharonov - bohm rings .",

    "the experiment also investigates the dependence of the asymmetry on the number of channels in the contacts of the sample .",
    "some experimental results , especially , the magnitude of the asymmetry , if four or more channels are open , agree well with existing theories @xcite .",

    "equation ( [ eq : main ] ) helps us to relate the correlations of non - linear conductances at arbitrary @xmath199 and @xmath200 in weakly interacting dots to those of the _ linear _ conductance .",
    "in particular , we find that in this limit the ratio of correlation functions of linear and non - linear conductances is constant at fixed @xmath17 .",
    "particularly , for ucf and fluctuations of @xmath126 , we find a universal relation @xmath201 insensitive to temperature @xmath178 and magnetic flux @xmath52 .",
    "this relation illustrates the qualitative arguments of @xcite that transport coefficients in the non - interacting system scale with @xmath202 .",
    "in the crossover from weak to strong interactions a typical amplitude of the fluctuations in @xmath15 changes from @xmath203 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : weaklimit ] ) , to a value @xmath204 . therefore , in the experiment , the interaction induced scaling of a non - linear response @xmath205 proportional to @xmath206 can be observed .",
    "in contrast for a non - interacting system we predict ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : weaklimit ] ) ) that @xmath207 and @xmath15 is proportional to @xmath208 .",
    "indeed , in the experiment by angers @xcite , this observation allows one to evaluate the interaction strength in aharonov - bohm rings , @xmath190 .",
    "we point out that similarly to two - terminal dots one can consider multi - terminal dots as well .",
    "since @xmath14 is very sensitive to interactions and is often easier to find experimentally , we concentrate on a similar anti - symmetric component @xmath209 and on a _",
    "mixed _ non - linear conductance @xmath210 , a derivative with respect to the gate voltage @xmath32 and contact voltage @xmath211 .",
    "one can demonstrate that in two - terminal dots the non - linearity with respect to @xmath32 is absent .",
    "indeed , @xmath212 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gabg ] ) is only due to @xmath213 .",
    "the derivative @xmath214 is always field - symmetric , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : u0 ] ) . in two - terminal dots",
    "@xmath215 is symmetric too , @xmath216 . as a consequence @xmath212 is even in magnetic field",
    "_ for two - terminal dot _ ( the classical effect of @xmath32 in two - terminal samples was considered in @xcite )",
    ". however , such asymmetry appears in a multi - terminal set - up , since @xmath217 .",
    "we find for the variances of @xmath209 and @xmath210 , @xmath218 equation ( [ eq : ab0 ] ) is of particular importance since it can serve to find @xmath219 in an experiment .",
    "this result does not contain an apriori unknown @xmath33 .",
    "it is useful to notice that for strongly interacting electrons the effect of gate voltages is weak ( @xmath220 ) and therefore voltage difference between gates and the dot can be rather large . therefore , the non - linear conductance becomes insensitive to the gate voltage and scales with @xmath221 .",
    "however , for weakly interacting electrons @xmath222 , the internal potential closely follows the gate voltage and so the effect of gates becomes measurable .",
    "the results we have obtained can now be compared with results for the linear conductance . from such a comparison",
    "we can assert that it is indeed the weakly non - linear transport regime which should be used to extract information on the interaction strength rather than the linear conductance . at finite temperature @xmath223 , in open quantum dots with many ballistic channels , @xmath42 , the amplitude of the random linear conductance fluctuations calculated in the strong interaction limit",
    "@xmath224 depends on interactions as @xmath225 , for @xmath179 and @xmath226 for @xmath227 @xcite . on the other hand , random fluctuations of the non - linear conductances",
    "@xmath22 in this limit @xmath224 are @xmath228 . for a voltage of the order of @xmath229 ,",
    "the fluctuating contribution of the non - linear component to the current is @xmath230 and can be compared with the fluctuating linear contribution @xmath231 .",
    "we conclude that for voltages in the interval @xmath232 the transport is still weakly non - linear , but the quantum contribution due to coulomb interaction to non - linear transport is stronger then the linear contribution .",
    "this estimate demonstrates that in dc - transport the effect of coulomb interactions in open mesoscopic conductors is best investigated in the non - linear regime .",
    "another important issue is the sensitivity to small magnetic flux , @xmath233 , when @xmath234 in a two - terminal dot becomes an asymmetric function due to coulomb interaction . in the experiment",
    "@xmath235 @xcite , so temperature should be taken into account .",
    "although we do not consider inelastic scattering due to @xmath236 , the non - linear conductance @xmath237 is temperature dependent since scattering is energy dependent .",
    "of particular interest for the experiment @xcite is the quantity @xmath238 in the limit where @xmath239 is still linear in flux , @xmath240 , see fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] .",
    "we use eq .",
    "( [ eq : main ] ) and find @xmath241 the data obtained at @xmath242 were fitted to a combination of the zero - temperature results @xcite corresponding to a @xmath243 given by the first line of ( [ eq : expfit ] ) with @xmath244 substituted by @xmath245 @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that a treatment of the crossover leads instead to eq .",
    "( [ eq : expfit ] ) with a non - linear conductance @xmath246 , where @xmath247 is defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : flux ] ) , and not @xmath245 .",
    "indeed , the flux dependence of @xmath248 starts to saturate at a scale which is parametrically smaller then @xmath12 .",
    "this is a consequence of the existence of two relevant time - scales , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "thus an attempt to fit the data to a theory of open diffusive samples @xcite by substituting @xmath249 fails to catch the difference between @xmath12 and @xmath250 .",
    "being an order - of - magnitude estimate to ballistic quantum dot results , the substitution @xmath251 misses parametric difference between these fields due to the zero - dimensional physics of a chaotic dot .",
    "this is especially important if the dependence of the effect on @xmath39 is considered , and @xmath252 at @xmath253 .",
    "we also point out that the temperature effect should have appeared even at such low temperatures as @xmath254ev . indeed , the last factor of eq .",
    "( [ eq : expfit ] ) is equal to 1 for @xmath179 and @xmath255 at @xmath227 . because of exponential suppression of the integrands at @xmath256 , for @xmath257",
    "the high temperature asymptotic is a good approximation . since @xmath258 , the nonlinear conductance as a function of @xmath39 and @xmath259 behaves as @xmath260 .    to summarize , we discussed the symmetric and anti - symmetric components of non - linear conductance through chaotic two - terminal and multi - terminal quantum dots .",
    "their correlations were found to strongly depend on the interplay between the asymmetry of ballistic contacts and the strength of coulomb interactions .",
    "we discussed the effect of a variation of the gate - voltage on the anti - symmetric component of weakly non - linear conductance through multi - terminal dots .",
    "we investigated the conditions on sample contacts , magnetic field and temperature under which the ( relative ) magnetic field asymmetry is maximal and thus most easy to detect .",
