    "shuichi tasaki . on a few occasions prof .",
    "tasaki encouraged us to publish the present work .",
    "we devote this work to him .",
    "the present work concerns the subject of quantum chaos .",
    "more precisely , the study of quantum systems whose corresponding classical systems exhibit chaotic behavior . prof .",
    "tasaki was one of the first authors to link irreversibility and chaotic dynamics using `` generalized spectral representations '' of time evolution operator ( also called frobenius - perron or fp operator ) .",
    "one interesting outcome of the work of prof .",
    "tasaki and others ( refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite , as well as @xcite and references therein ) was the demonstration that eigenfunctions of the fp operator may have a fractal nature .",
    "this was shown using classical chaotic maps , such as the multi - bernoulli map or the multi - baker map .",
    "the present paper is motivated by this work of prof .",
    "tasaki and others .    in classical systems",
    ", chaos may appear in isolated systems with few degrees of freedom as a consequence of stretching and folding dynamics .",
    "a simple model of this type of chaos is the baker map .",
    "the baker map acts on a unit square with coordinates @xmath0 representing the phase space .",
    "the square is squeezed down in @xmath1 direction ; it is stretched in @xmath2 direction by a factor of @xmath3 and then right half is put on top ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "these time - evolution rules are a simple example of stretching and folding dynamics .",
    "their consequence is a chaotic time evolution where any uncertainty in the initial condition grows exponentially with time until the uncertainty is spread over the whole phase space .    despite its chaotic evolution ,",
    "the baker map is invertible and unitary . after applying the map any number of times",
    ", the resulting final phase - space distribution can be reverted to the initial distribution by application of the inverse map .",
    "an even simpler map is obtained by projecting the baker map onto the horizontal @xmath4 axis .",
    "this simpler map is called the bernoulli map ; in contrast to the baker map it is not invertible .",
    "the bernoulli map maps a number @xmath5 $ ] as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a discretized time variable , taking only integer values .",
    "one can understand the chaotic nature of the bernoulli map by expressing the variable @xmath2 in binary notation .",
    "written this way , the effect of the bernoulli map is simply a digit shift . if @xmath8 then @xmath9 , where @xmath10 or @xmath11 . an initial @xmath2 given by an irrational number with random digits will be mapped to a random new point ; the trajectory followed by @xmath2 over time will be a random trajectory .",
    "corresponding to this behavior of a single trajectory , an ensemble of trajectories initially close together will end up uniformly spread out over the whole phase space ( i.e. , over the whole unit interval ) .",
    "an ensemble uniformly distributed over the whole phase space is an equilibrium distribution , since further applications of the map will not change it .",
    "equilibrium is an attractor for ensembles ; any initially smooth distribution of trajectories will approach the equilibrium distribution .",
    "this situation is reminiscent of the irreversible approach to equilibrium of ensembles in macroscopic systems , exhibited in processes such as diffusion .",
    "in fact , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite irreversibility ( or time - symmetry breaking ) can be formulated explicitly in simple chaotic models , such as the bernoulli and baker maps . in precise terms",
    ", irreversibility means that the fp operator for ensembles admits eigenvalues with magnitude less than @xmath11 , which implies that the corresponding eigenfunctions decay in time .",
    "such eigenvalues appear within `` generalized spectral representations '' of the fp operator .",
    "a remarkable feature of these representations is that they may include decaying eigenfunctions even in cases where the fp operator is unitary , as is the case in the classical baker map .",
    "these representations involve both regular functions and generalized functions ( or functionals ) playing the role of right and left eigenstates of the fp operator , respectively .    in quantum mechanics ,",
    "chaos is a more involved concept . for small , isolated quantum systems the hamiltonian has a discrete real spectrum .",
    "the eigenvalues of the fp operator are complex numbers with magnitude equal to @xmath11 ; no approach to equilibrium is apparent because there are no decaying eigenfunctions .    to describe quantum chaos one can introduce certain criteria , such as integrability , or the spacing of energy levels @xcite ( a thorough discussion on integrability of quantum systems is given in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this paper , we will follow a different approach .",
    "we will consider quantum maps , where the time evolution is applied in steps ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a discussion on quantum stochastic maps ) .",
    "we will study density matrices , corresponding to the classical statistical ensembles . and we will assume the quantum maps are coupled to their environment , which causes instantaneous loss of coherence at each time step @xcite .    specifically , we will study the quantum baker map coupled to its environment .",
    "the quantum baker map is the quantum analogue of the classical baker map .",
    "it has a physical realization as a set of quantum bits that can be shifted by an external action @xcite , one step at a time .",
    "we will assume that the environment causes the quantum bits to experience instant decoherence after each application of the quantum map .",
    "the result of the combination of the quantum baker map with decoherence will be a new map , which will turn out to be the quantum analogue of the classical bernoulli map . we will call this new map the quantum bernoulli map .",
    "we will show that in the quantum bernoulli map density matrices approach equilibrium , similar to their classical counterparts .",
    "the approach to equilibrium will be described by introducing quasi - eigenstates of the quantum fp operator , which decay in time .",
    "these states will appear in an expansion of the quantum fp operator analogous to the generalized spectral representation of the classical fp operator .",
    "the present work is of interest because it exemplifies the quantum correspondence between classical chaotic maps and their quantum analogues using an approach that as far as we know has not been taken before , namely through the generalized spectral representation of the fp operator .",
    "we will show that the quasi - eigenstates of the quantum fp operator approach their classical counterparts in the classical limit .",
    "interestingly , when approaching this limit , the eigenfunctions take a self - similar , quasi - fractal shape up to the point allowed by heisenberg s uncertainty principle .",
    "( fractals and self - similarity in quantum systems have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite , although in different contexts .",
    "a connection between the decaying eigenstates of the classical fp operator and spectral properties of chaotic quantum systems has been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the following section we will summarize the ensemble description of the classical bernoulli map , including the formulation of decaying eigenstates of the fp operator .",
    "then we will describe the quantum bernoulli map and we will formulate the quantum analogue of the generalized spectral representation of the fp operator .",
    "we will finish by discussing the development of the quasi - fractal shape in the quasi - eigenstates and giving final remarks .",
    "in this section we will review the classical bernoulli map , following ref .",
    "we will focus on an ensemble description of the maps , where the central role is played by the fp operator and its spectral ( eigenvalue ) representation . as we will see the right eigenstates of the fp operator are smooth functions that decay in time , while the left - eigenstates are functionals .",
    "the set of right and left eigenstates together with the corresponding eigenvalues will form the generalized spectral representation of the fp operator .    to introduce the bernoulli map we start with the baker map illustrated in fig .",
    "its fp operator is defined as @xmath12 for a probability density @xmath13 defined in the unit square .",
    "the bernoulli map is a projection of the baker map , obtained by integrating over a re - scaled @xmath1 , @xmath14 this gives the fp operator for the bernoulli map as @xmath15\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is a probability density defined in the unit interval .",
    "successive applications of @xmath17 on @xmath16 will make it evolve towards the uniform equilibrium distribution @xmath18 .",
    "this is true provided @xmath16 is a normalizable function , which excludes delta - functions corresponding to trajectories . to define normalizable functions we will use the inner product @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the norm of @xmath22 is then @xmath23 .",
    "we are discussing the approach to equilibrium of probability densities .",
    "but there is a property of the bernoulli map that seems to indicate that there can be no approach to equilibrium at all !",
    "solving this apparent contradiction will lead us to the main result of this section .",
    "we first introduce the hermitian conjugate operator @xmath24 in the usual way @xmath25 this equation shows that the right eigenstates of @xmath24 must be left eigenstates of @xmath17 and vice - versa . using the explicit form of @xmath17 the explicit form of @xmath24 can be shown to be @xmath26 the property of the bernoulli map that concerns us here is that while @xmath24 is not unitary because @xmath27 , it is isometric : @xmath28 this is an important property because it means that any right eigenfunctions of @xmath24 that are normalizable must have eigenvalues with magnitude equal to one . to see this , note that @xmath29 for any @xmath22 with unit norm , including any normalizable eigenstates of @xmath24 .",
    "the isometry of @xmath24 implies that it has no normalizable , decaying right - eigenfunctions , because normalizable eigenfunctions must have eigenvalues with unit magnitude .",
    "this , in turn , implies that there are no normalizable , decaying , left eigenfunctions of @xmath17 .",
    "all this seems to negate the approach to equilibrium characterized by decaying eigenfunctions .",
    "however , there is a way out . as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xmath17 can have decaying left eigen-_functionals_. in fact , the functionals @xmath30 ( with @xmath31 a non - negative number ) defined by @xmath32 are left eigenstates of @xmath17 with eigenvalues @xmath33 , which means that @xmath34 taking the hermitian conjugate we obtain @xmath35 which means that @xmath36 are right eigenstates of @xmath24 with eigenvalue @xmath33 . thus allowing functionals to play the role of eigenfunctions",
    "allows for the existence of eigenvalues smaller than 1 .",
    "the operator @xmath17 also has eigenvalues with magnitude less than @xmath11 .",
    "however , the corresponding right eigenfunctions _",
    "are _ normalizable . indeed , since @xmath27 , the argument below eq .",

    "we will discuss these eigenfunctions now .",
    "the right eigenfunctions of @xmath17 can be constructed by noting that @xmath17 acts as a shift operator @xmath37 and @xmath38 on the fourier - basis functions @xmath39\\ ] ] with @xmath40 and @xmath41 integers .",

    "we denote the set of integers @xmath150 satisfying this condition as @xmath188 .",
    "we have @xmath189 at each time step , the quantum bernoulli polynomials act as quasi - eigenstates of the fp operator only at the points in the sets @xmath188 . at the other points we get deviations .",

    "( [ sets ] ) means that these deviations appear in a self - similar fashion .",
    "this gives the evolving bernoulli polynomials a quasi - fractal shape .    in order to visualize this ,",
    "we have employed a computer program to calculate the exact evolution of densities under the quantum bernoulli map . as an example , at @xmath53 we take as the initial state the polynomial @xmath190 with @xmath191 and @xmath192 . at each step ,",
    "we re - scale the density by @xmath193 .",
    "if this were the classical bernoulli map , the graphs would remain unchanged for @xmath61 , because @xmath194 is an eigenstate of the fp operator with eigenvalue @xmath195 .",
    "but for the quantum map we have a different behavior .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig3 ] .     for @xmath196 , width=384 ]     for @xmath196 and @xmath197 , width=288 ]     , width=288 ]    we see the graphs developing the quasi - fractal shape mentioned above .",
    "we also notice that as @xmath7 increases the graphs are shifted .",
    "this is due to the @xmath31 term in the numerator of the right hand side of eq .",

    "@xmath198 the shift is negligible , but as @xmath7 increases the shift becomes noticeable .",

    "we call this evolving state a quasi - fractal .    when @xmath77 , the quasi - fractal behaves as a true fractal .",
    "at the same time , when @xmath77 , the amplitude of the fractal deviations from the classical bernoulli polynomial gets smaller and the graph looks smoother .",

    "we summarize the main results .",
    "we introduced the quantum bernoulli map by coupling the quantum baker map to an external environment that produces instant decoherence after each time step .",
    "we described the quantum bernoulli map in terms of decaying quasi - eigenstates of the frobenius - perron operator .",
    "these states are analogous to the classical bernoulli polynomials .",
    "we found conditions under which these quantum states approach the classical ones .",
    "moreover we found a quantum analogue of the generalized spectral representation of the classical bernoulli map .",
    "we also found a quantum analogue of the euler - maclaurin expansion . in this expansion",
    "the classical bernoulli polynomials are replaced by their quantum counterparts ; derivatives are replaced by differences .",
    "we have suggested that a signature of quantum chaos may be the presence of decaying eigenstates ( or quasi - eigenstates ) like the ones we have described in this paper .    one interesting finding is that even after decoherence , the quantum bernoulli map shows quantum corrections with respect to the classical bernoulli map .",
    "the quantum corrections give a quasi - fractal shape to the evolving quantum bernoulli polynomials .",
    "these corrections vanish in the classical limit . at the same time , as the classical limit is approached , the quasi - fractal approaches a true fractal . in a sense , this fractal is hidden in the classical limit . to our knowledge",
    "this is a feature chaotic quantum systems that has not received attention before .",
    "an open question is : do quasi - fractals like the ones we described here appear in other chaotic quantum systems ?",
    "self - similarity in quantum systems has been discussed in other contexts .",
    "for example in @xcite , self - similarity has been discussed in the context of non - linear resonances .",
    "@xcite have discussed singular spectra or fractal spectra of quantum systems , that appear , for example , with quasi - periodic lattices . ref .",
    "@xcite gives an interesting discussion on fractals generated by a quantum rotor .",
    "the self - similarity discussed in the present work is of a different origin .",
    "still , it would be worthwhile to investigate any connections with these other works .",
    "another question for future work is whether the quantum baker map can be described along the lines developed in this paper ( i.e. using quantum bernoulli polynomials and difference operators ) .",
    "a final point worth noting is that the model we have described may be realized as a set of shifting quantum bits subject to repeated measurements after each shift .",
    "the measurements cause instantaneous decoherence .",
    "if the measurement time interval is greater than the zeno time @xcite , the system decays exponentially @xcite .",
    "equations ( [ qfract ] ) and ( [ qfract _ ] ) manifest this property .",
    "however if the time interval between measurements approaches zero , we might obtain the quantum zeno effect .",
    "we speculate that repeated measurements will prevent the system from decaying despite the underlying chaotic dynamics .",
    "in this appendix we show that the functions @xmath204 } \\frac{-e_{j , l }   ( q_n ) } { \\left(1-e_{j , l}^*(q_1)\\right)^\\alpha } \\ ] ] are polynomials of degree @xmath31 in @xmath63 .",
    "let us first state two properties of these functions , which are easily proved : @xmath205 and ( for @xmath206 ) @xmath207 from the last equation we find that @xmath208 we can find @xmath209 using eq .",
