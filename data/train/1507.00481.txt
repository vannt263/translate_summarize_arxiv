    "[ sec : introduction ] patterns observed in bacterial colonies growing on surfaces of semisolid agar plates realize a variety of fractal and self - affine structures studied in statistical mechanics and fractal physics @xcite . in a series of experimental studies @xcite , it has been clarified that the morphology of growing bacterial colonies at the macroscopic scale does not depend on the biological details of individual organisms , but depends only on environmental conditions controlled by the agar concentration @xmath0 and the nutrient concentration @xmath1 .",
    "cell motility is changed by varying @xmath0 and the growth rate is controlled by varying @xmath1 , and then different patterns appear in different regions in a morphology diagram drawn on the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane . on this plane , a diffusion - limited aggregation ( dla)-like pattern @xcite , an eden - like pattern @xcite , a concentric - ring pattern , a homogeneously spreading disk like pattern , and a dense branching morphology ( dbm ) pattern @xcite have been recorded .",
    "since some of these patterns are observed not only in biological systems , but also in chemical and physical systems , such as those in crystal growth , aggregation processes , and viscous fingering @xcite , the mechanism of pattern formation could be common in organisms and inorganic substances , and a theoretical study by mathematical modeling and analysis will be useful for understanding the underlying universal principles @xcite .    in a recent paper @xcite , we have reported the physical aspects of the collective motion of bacterial cells observed in shallow circular pools prepared on the surface of an agar plate .",
    "the diameters of the pools are arranged so as not to be much larger than the length of the bacterial cells swimming in the pools .",
    "we used _ bacillus _ ( _ b. _ ) _ subtilis _ and found six different types of collective motion , including one - way and two - way rotational motion along the brim of a circular pool and collective oscillatory motion in the entire pool . analyzing experimental observations in 117 circular pools",
    ", we found that these six types of collective motion can be classified using only two parameters : the reduced cell length @xmath2 , which is defined as the ratio of the average cell length in a pool to the pool diameter , and the cell density @xmath3 in the pool .",
    "we obtained a phase diagram for the collective motion drawn on the @xmath2-@xmath3 plane and predicted that simple modeling with the two control parameters will be able to explain the variety of collective motion of bacterial cells .",
    "the above results imply that physical considerations are applicable and useful to explain the changes in the morphology of bacterial colonies at the macroscopic scale as well as the dynamical transitions of the collective motion of bacterial cells at the microscopic scale caused by environmental variations . on the basis of them , in this paper , we will report the experimental results and numerical analyses of growth processes starting from a single bacterial cell observed in formation of colony patterns .",
    "we tried to analyze the observed growth process by fractal analysis and by using systems of differential equations .    throughout the experiment reported in this paper",
    ", we used _",
    "b. subtilis _ wild - type strain og-01 .",
    "cells of this strain are rod - shaped ( 0.51.0 @xmath4 m in diameter , 25 @xmath4 m in length ) with peritrichous flagella .",
    "they swim in a straight line in water by bundling and rotating the flagella . under unfavorable environmental conditions , such as on a nutrient - poor medium or a dry agar plate , they become spores . when a small number of cells are inoculated on the surface of a semisolid agar plate",
    ", they go through a resting period of about 7 h before starting two - dimensional colony expansion .",

    ", cell multiplications are repeated with a constant cell cycle ( doubling time ) , but daughter cells fail to separate after each cell cycle , although the cytoplasm has been compartmentalized by septum formation .",
    "then , a long filament is produced , which consists of a chain of cells linked end to end @xcite .",
    "such a filament writhes as it elongates on the agar plate , and eventually some segment starts folding and a twofold part of the filament is created .",
    "figure [ fig : picture1 ] shows a typical configuration of a filament in which twofold parts have been created . sooner or later , we will see the appearance of threefold parts , fourfold parts , and so forth , and the filament configuration of linked cells becomes complicated on the agar plate .",
    "mendelson and coworkers have intensively studied the supercoiling processes performed by such cell filaments of _ b. subtilis _",
    "they are interested in the situation wherein the filaments twist to make a double - stranded helix .",
    "the double - stranded structure itself twists while writhing , eventually comes in contact with itself , and forms a supercoil . by the repetition of such supercoiling processes ,",
    "macroscopic structures of millimeter length are created , which are called bacterial macrofibers .",
    "the interesting motion of macrofibers was reported by mendelson and coworkers .",
