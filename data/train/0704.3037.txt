    "nevertheless we remark that in order to have the proper continuum limit it is not sufficient to have a very large density of particles .",

    "as already mentioned , to model an autocatalytic reaction ( [ eq : autocatalytic ] ) , we consider two kinds of particles : type @xmath24 particles , @xmath41 ( unstable ) , and type @xmath25 particles , @xmath42 ( stable ) .",

    "[ colordynamics ]    the probability ( per unit time ) @xmath47 depends on the number of stable particles within the interaction radius . in fact , in the continuum limit , the autocatalytic reaction ( [ eq : autocatalytic ] ) is expected to obey the mass action law @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the concentrations of particles @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , with @xmath51 .",

    "concerning the relevant length scales of the system one can identify the following ones : i ) the mean nearest neighbour distance between particles , @xmath71 , ii ) the interaction radius of the model , @xmath33 , iii ) the kuramoto length scale , @xmath32 and iv ) the size of the system @xmath72 .",

    "it is the objective of this work to investigate some properties of the model in this regime .    before starting with the discussion of the numerical results ,",
    "some comments follow about the role of diffusion .",
    "since we introduce the natural length - scale of the interaction , @xmath33 , a diffusive time related to this distance arises @xmath76 .",
    "when this time is much smaller than the reaction time @xmath4 the system is locally homogeneized before reaction happens .",
    "in order to focus on the reaction properties rather than on the diffusive effects we work in the limit @xmath77 .",
    "firstly we study the model in a closed vessel , where , as initial condition , particles of both types are premixed and uniformly randomly distributed in space .",
    "in such a case , the system evolution necessarily ends with the complete filling of the box with type @xmath25 particles .",
    "therefore the most significant physical quantity is the filling rate of particles @xmath25 , which is related to the reaction rate .",
    "we proceed by fixing the value of @xmath33 and varying @xmath0 in order to explore different situations : a ) continuum limit , @xmath78 ; b ) the effect of the discreteness , @xmath79 . in this case , at variance with front propagation properties discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : front ] , we will see that the kuramoto length does not play a fundamental role .",
    "the basic reason for this is the spatially random distribution of particles .",
    "we adopt periodic boundary conditions on a square domain of side @xmath80 ; the reaction rate is set to @xmath81 ; and averages are numerically computed over a large number of noise realizations .",
    "since particles are well premixed , the process is spatially homogenous , and we may assume that the growth rate of @xmath68 , ( see eq .",

    "note that @xmath85 contains all of the dependence of our system on the interaction radius and the number of particles and , therefore , it is the proper quantity to study the influence of the discreteness in the model .    in figure",

    "the fit is rather good and , for large @xmath0 , @xmath90 .",
    "the equation @xmath91 can be easily solved : @xmath92    thus looking at the evolution of @xmath93 and using eq .",
    "( [ sol1 ] ) we have a value of @xmath85 which is , in principle , different from the one in eq.([renormalized ] ) .",
    "however , the two values are rather close , and in the following we will present results only for the last one , obtained from eq.([sol1 ] ) . as an example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] , we show @xmath68 versus time obtained from the numerical simulation of the particle model , and the best fit using eq .",
    "( [ sol1 ] ) from which a value of @xmath85 comes out . as previously shown in figure  [ fig : fitg ] , for large @xmath0 the value of @xmath85 goes to the continuum limit @xmath3 . in figure",
    "[ fig : probrenorm ] , where the renormalized reaction probability versus @xmath0 is plotted , one sees that the continuum limit , @xmath94 is , as expected , obtained with good accuracy for large @xmath0 values .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath78 , while for values of @xmath0 such that @xmath74 is comparable or smaller than @xmath33 the continuous description becomes inaccurate .",
    "more important for our purpose is the behavior of @xmath85 versus @xmath33 . with a fixed total number of particles , @xmath0 , and a well premixed initial condition , we compute @xmath85 varying the interaction radius @xmath33 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : versusr ] ) .",
    "we observe that in the continuum limit ( @xmath78 ) we recover @xmath95 . for small @xmath33 , such that @xmath96 , @xmath85 seems to reach a constant value , which is around @xmath97 smaller than the fkpp one .",
    "few words have to be spent about the difference between the large @xmath0 limit ( of figure  [ fig : probrenorm ] ) and the large @xmath33 limit of figure  [ fig : versusr ] . for the problem under discussion one has the same behavior of the continuum limit if @xmath78 irrespective of the value of the kuramoto length .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : versusr ] one has @xmath98 which is much smaller than the values of @xmath33 for which the _ continuum _ limit holds . on the other hand , in the study of front properties we will see that the scenario is different and @xmath32 can play a relevant role .",
    "now we want to discuss the dependence of the previous results on the chosen initial condition . in figure",
    "[ fig : compinitcond ] we compare @xmath85 in the premixed case , and when particles are initially separated in space .",
    "indeed , if the premixed particle condition is relaxed , and the system is initially prepared with different spatial distributions of particles , the renormalized reaction probability significantly changes , since @xmath99 strongly depends on the particle configuration ( see the inset in figure  [ fig : compinitcond ] ) .",
    "studies on the quenching phenomenon  @xcite shows that in a continuous reaction - diffusion system in presence of an advectin velocity field , and with a reaction term of ignition type , i.e. @xmath100 for @xmath101 , for a suitable size of the `` hot '' region , there is no propagating front , and the reaction quenches . on the contrary , in a continuous fkpp system  ( [ fkpp ] ) quenching phenomena do not appear  @xcite .",
    "here we show that in a _ particle description _ of an fkpp system quenching can occur .    still considering premixed particles in a closed vessel ,",
    "let us introduce the possibility that a stable particle ( @xmath25 ) can turn into an unstable one ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "that is , beyond the autocatalytic reaction  ( [ eq : autocatalytic ] ) , we introduce a new reaction @xmath102 where @xmath103 is its rate .",
    "therefore we have the following reaction rules :    * if @xmath43 then @xmath44 with probability @xmath45 * if @xmath46 then @xmath104 with probability @xmath105    @xmath106 is the same of the previous section , while @xmath107 does not depend on the interaction radius @xmath33 , since it is a single particle property .    the renormalized description of this model is given by @xmath108 whose solution is @xmath109 with @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "two different scenarios now appear . if @xmath112 for all @xmath0 the reaction finishes . on the other side , when @xmath113 we have a similar behavior as in the case with @xmath114 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : thetab_t ] we show @xmath50 vs @xmath115 for different values of @xmath33 .",
    "it is apparent that for large @xmath33 the system behaves similarly to the case @xmath114 ( including the continuum limit for the long time value of the concentration , @xmath116 , for large @xmath33 ) .",
    "however , for @xmath33 small enough the concentration asymptotically vanishes , that is we have a quenching phenomenon .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda_r ] where we plot @xmath117 vs @xmath33 ( obtained analogously to fig .",
    "[ fig : versusr ] , i.e. , fitting the analytical solution to the numerical results ) . for large @xmath33",
    "we approach the continuum limit and @xmath118 , while for small @xmath33 we have quenching corresponding to negative values of @xmath117 .",
    "this is a relevant result , entirely due to the role of the interaction radius , @xmath33 , which reflects the discrete character of the model in the quenching mechanism .",
    "let us note that , at variance with the results in the previous section ( which are just quantitative changes with respect to the continuous equation ) , now the discrete nature of the system is able to produce a feature ( the quenching ) which is absent in the continuum limit  @xcite .",
    "in the previous sections we have studied the dynamics of interacting particle systems in a closed container .",
    "we now focus on a different configuration , corresponding to well - separated chemicals in an open domain , and we investigate evolution properties , such as front speed and thickness @xcite , in terms of the interaction radius . in this section",
    "we take @xmath119 , @xmath120 , with periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath121 direction , and rigid walls in the @xmath122 direction .",
    "the burnt ( type @xmath25 ) particles are initially concentrated in the leftmost part of the system , so that a propagating reaction front , from left to right , develops .",
    "the reaction term we use is just the autocatalytic one  ( [ eq : autocatalytic ] ) , i.e. , @xmath114 . we separately study the front speed and the front thickness .",
    "we can define the instant front position as @xmath123 and the front speed : @xmath124 which is computed after a transient and before the complete saturation is approached . in fig .",
    "[ fig : evolution ] we show @xmath125 vs time for different values of @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath126 is obtained as the slope of the best fit to the curves in the proper interval .",
    "we expect that , via the renormalized description of the fkpp equation , that is eq .",
    "( [ fkpp ] ) with @xmath3 replaced by @xmath85 , the front speed of the particle model at varying @xmath33 should be @xmath127 we saw that in closed basins different initial conditions on the distribution of particles select different @xmath85 s , see figure  [ fig : compinitcond ] . therefore , for the study of front propagation",
    "the proper @xmath85 is that one computed in the case of initially separated particles distribution ( symbol @xmath128 in figure  [ fig : compinitcond ] ) .",
    "the numerical results , reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : frontspeed ] , confirm our prediction at least for small @xmath33 , i.e. , the front speed behaves as in the fkpp case ( eq .  ( [ eq : fkppfrontspeed ] ) ) .    however , the large discrepancy observed for large @xmath33 can not be explained by a simple difference in the initial particle distribution .",
    "this difference arises because the interaction radius becomes larger than the kuramoto length @xmath129 and therefore the continuum fkpp limit does not hold . indeed , in particle systems , when @xmath130 the interaction term establishes a connection between regions containing @xmath24 particles and regions containing @xmath25 particles that in the classical fkpp equation could not be connected .",
    "when @xmath131 , it is not possible to obtain the continuum fkpp limit  ( [ fkpp ] ) even with an arbitrarily large number of particles . in figure",
    "[ fig : confrontspeedn ] it is shown the front speed at varying @xmath33 for various @xmath0 .",
    "one can observe that at increasing @xmath0 for small @xmath33 the front speed approaches the fkpp value , while for large @xmath33 the front speed does not depend on @xmath0 and the value is definitely different from the fkpp value .",
    "a simple argument explains the behavior of @xmath126 for large @xmath33 .",
    "the front speed is proportional to the front length times the reaction rate , e.g. , in the fkpp equation @xmath132 . when the interaction radius is greater than the kuramoto length it is reasonable to expect that the front length becomes proportional to @xmath33 and so the front speed : @xmath133 in agreement with the results shown in figures  [ fig : frontspeed ] ,  [ fig : confrontspeedn ] and in figure  [ fig : fsvaryp ] for various @xmath3 . in particular , in the inset of figure  [ fig : fsvaryp ] one can see the behaviour of @xmath134 as a function of @xmath3 : @xmath135 where @xmath136 is a constant .",
    "this is not surprising because @xmath3 is the continuum limit for the reaction rate which is reached asymptotically by the particle system , i.e. , @xmath90 for large @xmath33 .      as a further confirmation of previous results ,",
    "we investigate the behaviour of front thickness at varying @xmath33 .",
    "note that in the continuum limit there are many ways to compute the front thickness of a propagating front  @xcite . in the particle case , however , it is not obvious how to define a front profile .",
    "we proceed by defining an averaged field that resembles the front shape .",
    "essentially this is a histogram over particle positions . fixing our attention on @xmath24 particles ,",
    "we define @xmath137 where @xmath138 counts the number of @xmath24 particles whose @xmath122 coordinate lays between @xmath122 and @xmath139 . when the number of particles is large the value of @xmath140 could be taken arbitrarily small whereas , in general , @xmath140 has to be small , but at the same time large enough in order to avoid large fluctuations in @xmath141 .",
    "we use a relatively small @xmath140 ( few @xmath74 ) and we average @xmath138 over many different realizations .",
    "the front shape of an fkpp system behaves as @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the front thickness , and @xmath125 the front position at time @xmath115 . in figure",
    "[ fig : frontthickfit ] it is shown the exponential behaviour of the front profile and the fit obtained from of eq .",
    "( [ frontshape ] ) .",
    "in particular eq .",
    "( [ frontshape ] ) works well in the central region of the front , i.e. , where corrections due to the particle nature of the system are less important .",
    "other measurements of the front profile provide similar results . in figure  [",
    "fig : frontthick ] we plot the front thickness , @xmath143 , computed for different values of @xmath33 .",
    "again , for @xmath33 smaller than the kuramoto length the front thickness is constant , while for values of @xmath33 greater than @xmath144 the front thickness behaves as @xmath145 . this result confirms the assumption of equation  ( [ eq : vfrgrandi ] ) . the constant value reported in figure  [ fig : frontthick ] ( the dashed line ) is only an indicative value to show that for @xmath146 the front thickness is constant , and it is not the fkpp value of the front width .",
    "in this work we studied the effects of the discrete - particle character in an autocatalytic reacting system , described in terms of chemical dynamics where two types of brownian particles interact when they are at a distance smaller than a certain radius @xmath33 . we have shown that in a suitable continuum limit the system is equivalent to an fkpp model for the concentration of particles , and we have focused on the differences that arise when the conditions for this limit are not fullfilled .",
    "the continuum limit holds if some relations among the relevant length scales ( the interaction radius , the mean distance between particles and the kuramoto length ) of the problem are satisfied . for well - premixed initial conditions of the particles distribution only the first two lengths play a role .",
    "however , for front propagation , which requires a separated initial distribution of particles , also the kuramoto length is important .",
    "we have also considered the modified chemical dynamics @xmath147 , and @xmath148 , where , at variance with the continuum limit , one can have the possibility of quenching , for small values of @xmath33 .",
    "this is due to the particle nature of the model , which induces a qualitative difference with respect to the continuous description .",
    "moreover , in the context of front propagation , we have shown that particular conditions exist such that , increasing the particle density , the system reaches a continuum limit which is definitely different from the continuum fkpp limit .",
    "we conclude noting that many biological systems are characterised by the two main ingredients of our work : the minimal distance for the interaction , and the exiguity of the number of organisms  @xcite .",
