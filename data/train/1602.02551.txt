    "consider the core - shell spherical plasmonic particle shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . the shell ( core )",
    "is made of drude - metals with plasma frequency @xmath13 and tensor electric susceptibility @xmath14 ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) .",
    "the outer shell radius and core radius are @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the particle is electrically small hence we use polarizability theory and discrete dipole approximation to model the particle s dynamics .",
    "the particle response to an exciting electromagnetic field is fully characterized by the dipole response @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the local electric field and @xmath21 is the particle s _ dynamic _ polarizability tensor .",
    "it can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the _ static _",
    "polarizability , and the imaginary term on the right represents radiation damping @xcite .",
    "we derive @xmath23 by solving the laplace equation under @xmath9-directed local electric field @xmath24 , with the appropriate boundary conditions . for non - magnetized particle",
    "the problem reduces to a core - shell spherical structure with scalar permittivities @xmath25 .",
    "analytic expressions for the corresponding @xmath23 can be found , e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "isotropic core - shell particles were suggested also for a variety of applications , including compact waveguides @xcite , non - linear switches @xcite , absorbers @xcite , and more . however , under magnetization @xmath26 become tensors . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "a study of the polarizability and dipole - responses of the entire structure and of the shell and core regions for tensor @xmath26 are not currently available in the literature .",
    "see supporting information ( si ) for analytical derivation of the fields , core and shell polarization , and polarizability of the magnetized core - shell particle . in the si and below",
    "we also compare the results of this analysis to exact full - wave simulations using the cst@xmath27 commercial software .",
    "using the formulation developed in the supporting information ( si ) , we have extracted the shell and core dipoles , net dipole and polarizabilites for @xmath28 , and for @xmath29 .",
    "we note that the latter is a convenient representative of the typical range achieved with various metals .",
    "for example , for au - ag structure it is about 1.0022 according to @xcite , or 1.00137 according to @xcite .",
    "different ratios ( smaller and larger ) are obtained by using other metals as can be seen from the data provided there .",
    "furthermore , one may tune the plasma frequency by using the techniques reported e.g. in references @xcite .",
    "we chose the ratio 1.005 just for convenience . the incident field strength is @xmath30v / m . under these parameters the particle possesses two resonances ( see si ) .",
    "the lowest one is essentially similar to the resonance of a uniform sphere in the sense that the dipolar moments of the shell and core are in - phase , and the associated polarization densities are very similar . in contrast , the upper one resembles a dark - mode nature - the dipolar moments are in opposite phases .",
    "we concentrate here on the upper resonance .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the shell and core dipoles @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the shell and core volumes , and @xmath33 are their polarization densities . throughout the entire domain @xmath34 .",
    "the equality is exact at the `` dark point '' @xmath35 where @xmath21 vanishes , and so does the net dipolar moment of the entire particle . @xmath36",
    "resonate at a slightly higher frequency , creating net resonance of extremely narrow line shape at @xmath37 - the `` dark resonance '' .",
    "the upper inset shows @xmath38 on a logarithmic scale and compares it with exact full - wave numerical simulation done with the cst@xmath27 commercial software . here",
    "the parameters are @xmath39 nm and @xmath40 ( corresponding to ag ) .",
    "the dark point , the dark resonance , and the non - symmetric fano - like line shape @xcite are seen .",
    "there is an excellent agreement between the quasi - static analysis presented in the si , and the full - wave simulations .",
    "are the shell and core dipoles , respectively , and @xmath41 .",
    "the net dipole of the sphere identically vanishes at the `` dark - point '' - a frequency located on the left side close to the resonance .",
    "the inset in the lower left side shows a blow - up picture near the resonance point .",
    "the inset in the upper left side compares the quasistatic analysis of @xmath38 to that obtained by full wave analysis with a commercial software .",
    "the dark point is clearly seen left of the dark resonance.,width=453 ]    figure [ new_fig_4 ] shows the absolute components of the polarizability @xmath21 , namely @xmath42 and @xmath43 as a function of frequency for a range of magnetization levels .",
    "it is seen that for @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) there is no cross - polarization : @xmath46 .",
    "cross - polarization and resonance splitting take place for @xmath47 . at low levels of @xmath11 ,",
    "the splitting is visually `` smeared '' due to the particle s radiation loss as can be seen in the bottom part of both panes of this figure .",
    "the horizontal dashed line corresponds to @xmath48 t for ag - like shell .     versus frequency and magnetization .",
    "the horizontal dashed line corresponds to @xmath48 t for ag - like shell . note the resonance splitting due to bias magnetization.,width=453 ]",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the particle dynamic polarizabilities @xmath49 under magnetic bias @xmath50 that corresponds to @xmath51 , corresponding to @xmath52 tesla for ag or au material .",
    "the combined dark resonance splits into two separate resonances . at this level of magnetization both are hidden within a single line - shape ( since the line - width , due to radiation damping , is larger than the split ) .",
    "as seen , at the central frequency the polarizabilities real - part vanish , and one obtains a _ linear _ polarization , rotated by the angle @xmath53 relative to the exciting field . as one shifts away from this central frequency , the dipole polarization becomes elliptical , with _",
    "tilted _ principal axis . in this domain ,",
    "the tilt angle @xmath54 alone is not a sufficient measure of the effective polarization rotation ; one needs also the _ ellipticity _ angle @xmath55 defined via @xmath56 where @xmath57 are the ellipse major and minor principle axes .",
    "@xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) correspond to linear ( circular ) polarizations .",
    "we emphasize that the results in this figure are verified by exact full - wave numerical simulation using the @xmath60 commercial software ( see si ) .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows @xmath54 and @xmath55 of the dipole s elliptical polarization vs. frequency , for the particle parameters of fig .",
    "the main figure shows @xmath61 for the upper resonance domain .",
    "the inset shows the lower resonance , that exhibits essentially the same dynamics of a conventional magnetized plasmonic particle . in the upper resonance region ,",
    "@xmath62 t provides dipole tilts of three orders of magnitude larger compare to the tilts in the lower resonance .",
    "we refer the reader also to fig .  3 in the si and the pertaining discussion there , showing @xmath61 for a conventional particle of lossless ag .",
    "the maximal rotation for @xmath62 t is less than @xmath63 .",
    ", corresponding to the white dashed line of fig .",
    "[ new_fig_4 ] .",
    "the real ( imaginary ) part of @xmath21 are odd ( even ) in @xmath64 .",
    "hence , the elliptical polarization changes from right - hand to left - hand across the central frequency.,width=453 ]     under magnetization of 1.5 t in ag - like core - shell particle .",
    "the inset shows the lower - resonance domain .",
    "the `` dark point '' and `` dark resonance '' refer to their locations in the pre - magnetized particle , and @xmath65 is the shift in ghz from the central frequency of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , using @xmath13 of ag.,width=453 ]",
    "consider a metasurface made of periodic two - dimensional array of our dark - mode particles , shown schematically in fig .",
    "it can be used as a faraday rotator for applications such as optical isolators .",
    "the array of rotated dipoles would generate also a net rotated e - field , in the same manner as suggested , e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "there is a well established and accurate theory for the electrodynamic properties of such metasurfaces ",
    "see e.g.  sec .",
    "4.5 in @xcite  and its application to the present particles is straightforward .",
    "we note that this theory takes into account the dipole - dipole interaction in the array and its effect on the reflection and transmission ( see e.g. the interaction constant @xmath66 there ) , as well as the individual particle s properties .        the far field transmission and reflection properties of this array",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] , respectively , as functions of @xmath67 and @xmath11 .",
    "the parameters used are @xmath68hz , @xmath69 , @xmath70 nm , and @xmath71 nm . for @xmath48 t and near @xmath72 the transmitted far field tilt angle is about @xmath73 , with nearly linear polarization .",
    "the power transmitted into this tilted field is about 50% of the incident field .",
    "as @xmath11 increases the transmitted field resonance splits into two branches , with large tilt and ellipticity .",
    "essentially the same dynamics is observed for the reflected field in fig .",
    "note that for @xmath45 the screen resonance is slightly blue - shifted with respect to the resonance of a single unbiased particle ( the latter is at @xmath74 ) .",
    "this shift is due to the dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "also note that the splitting effect shown for an individual particle in fig .",
    "[ new_fig_4 ] , exists also here .",
    "finally we note that the screen transmission coefficient obtained from the semi - analytical approach used here , is compared to that obtained from full - wave simulation using the cst@xmath27 in fig .  4 of the si .",
    "since the latter is computation - intensive the comparison there is done only for the magnetic bias of 1.5tesla and not as a map of the type shown in figs .",
    "[ fig6],[fig7 ] here .",
    "it is seen that the results agree well .",
    "is the shift from the central frequency of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( the dark resonance without magnetization ) , using @xmath13 of ag.,width=453 ]          clearly , material loss degrades the performance of the effect reported here .",
    "a parametric study of the dark - mode based faraday rotation under low material loss is included in the si . in the range of parameters tested it is seen there that although the tilt angle may be reduced significantly , it is still orders of magnitude larger than the tilt obtained by conventional particles under the same conditions .",
    "a preliminary study of a synergetic interaction between dark mode and faraday rotation is reported .",
    "the study uses the core - shell geometry with two nearly equal plasma frequencies as a test - case in which the mathematical analysis is straightforward , and the physical interpretation of the processes involved is simple .",
    "our test - case shows that a profound enhancement of faraday rotation can be achieved , thus potentially establishing a platform for non - reciprocal optical devices at relatively weak magnetic fields .",
    "while the study was carried on a simple test - case , we believe that our conclusions can be generalized and applied to other configurations that support dark - mode states .",
    "the supporting information includes detailed derivation of the polarizability expressions used throughout the article , in addition to a discussion regarding the response of the core and the shell separately , a detailed mapping of the resonances in the system , details regarding the application of the expressions to the screen problem and regarding the numerical simulations , and figures describing the effect of material loss .",
