    "in a range of social and economic interactions ( public goods provision , job search , political alliances , trade , friendships , information collection , and so on ) an individual s welfare depends both on her own actions and on the actions taken by her interacting partners .",
    "much effort has been devoted to understand how the pattern of social connections shapes the choices that individuals make and the payoffs that they can earn@xcite ( see @xcite for an overview of the field ) . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the traditional approach of identifying the bayes - nash equilibria in one - shot network games is problematic due to the existence of multiple equilibria ( even for very small network sizes ) , which imply a huge range of possible outcomes .",
    "nevertheless , it has been shown that the problem of multiplicity can be resolved sometimes by the introduction of incomplete information @xcite  which in the context of network games means having only a local knowledge of the network : a player is aware of the number of her connections ( her degree ) but not of the degrees of the others .",
    "the key point is that when players have limited information about the network they are unable to condition their behavior on its fine details , and this leads to a significant simplification and sharpening of equilibrium predictions .",
    "a general framework for the study of multiplayer games on networks under incomplete information has been recently developed @xcite ; in particular , galeotti et al . @xcite proved the existence of bayes - nash equilibria involving strategies that are monotonic with respect to players degrees and symmetric , _",
    "i.e. _ , with all players of the same degree choosing the same strategy .    here , instead of focusing on equilibrium strategies played once and for all",
    ", we consider iterated network games within an evolutionary framework @xcite : players own actions are described by a strategy which is subject to an evolutionary process @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that this is different from the stochastic stability approach presented for this type of games in @xcite , where the focus is on the different time regimes of the evolution .",
    "in fact , our framework represents a way to select among the large multiplicity of equilibria that exist in network games in a spirit very close to that of biological evolution .",
    "in particular , we consider two main mechanisms for players to adapt their strategy : imitation and rational deduction .",
    "moreover , we consider two representative social network structures ( erds - rnyi random graphs @xcite and scale - free networks @xcite ) and , as in @xcite , two canonical types of interaction : the best - shot game and the coordination game , as representatives for strategic substitutes and strategic complements , respectively @xcite .",
    "we run a numerical simulation program in order to understand which nash equilibria are dynamically accessible ( by adaptation of players strategies ) , and in general to identify the strategy configurations that are the attractors of such dynamics  either nash equilibria or , possibly , other types of stationary states . as a reference",
    ", we consider the analytical results we obtained in @xcite , where we studied this issue by means of two mean field approaches , the usual , homogeneous one , and its heterogeneous version @xcite .",
    "as shown below , the numerical simulations allow us to assess the accuracy of the pictures provided by the two approaches and , furthermore , to gain more insight on the individual behavior of the different types of players .",
    "additionally , we compare our approach with the theoretical framework of galeotti et al .",
    "@xcite for one - shot games under incomplete information .",
    "we show that the nash equilibria predicted by their theory generally do not coincide with the ones obtained by evolutionary dynamics ; nevertheless , these equilibria possess qualitatively the same features of those resulting from evolution , in terms of players strategies with respect to their neighborhood structure .    our work is organized as follows .",
    "we begin by introducing in section 2 the games we will be considering , followed by a presentation of the two evolutionary dynamics in section 3 .",
    "section 4 , the main part of the paper , presents the results of numerical simulations , which , for reference , are accompanied by a brief review of the mean field results in @xcite .",
    "finally , section 5 concludes the paper with a summary of the results and a discussion of how they compare to the different theoretical frameworks .",
    "this section presents two simple games played on networks , reflecting strategic substitutes and strategic complements , respectively @xcite .",
    "these two cases represent alternative scenarios on how a player s payoff is affected by the actions of others , covering many of the game - theoretic applications studied in the economic literature . in particular , strategic substitutes encompass many scenarios that allow for free riding or have a public good structure of play , whereas strategic complements arise whenever the benefit that an individual obtains from undertaking a given behavior is greater as more of her partners do the same .",
    "below , we first recall the framework by galeotti et al .",
    "@xcite under the assumption of incomplete information , which is natural in many circumstances .",
    "consider a society of @xmath0 agents , placed on the nodes of a social network .",
    "the links between agents reflect social interactions , and connected agents are said to be _",
    "every individual must choose independently an action in @xmath1 , where action 1 may be interpreted as _ cooperating _ and action 0 as not doing so  or _",
    "defecting_. to define the payoffs , let @xmath2 be the action chosen by agent @xmath3 , @xmath4 the set of @xmath3 s neighbors , @xmath5 the aggregate action in @xmath4 , and @xmath6 .",
    "there is a cost @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , for choosing action @xmath9 , while action @xmath10 bears no cost .",
    "the payoff function takes the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the heaviside step function @xmath13 if @xmath14 and @xmath15 otherwise .",
    "strategic substitutes thus represent an anti - coordination game : a player would prefer that someone of her neighbors takes action 1 ( rather than taking the action herself ) , but she would be willing to take action 1 if nobody in the neighborhood does . in general ,",
    "a context in which players have complete information on the social network allows for a very rich set of nash equilibria of the game @xcite , where the relation between network connections , equilibrium actions and payoffs may exhibit very different patterns ( even when all agents of the same degree choose the same actions ) .",
    "things change , however , by relaxing the assumption of complete information  as shown in @xcite .",
    "the assumption is that each player knows her own degree @xmath16 and the probability distribution @xmath17 of the degree @xmath18 of her neighbors , which for uncorrelated networks ( degrees of neighboring nodes are independent ) reads @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the degree distribution of the network and @xmath21 the average connectivity . under these conditions ,",
    "galeotti et al .",
    "@xcite study the game within the framework of bayesian games and show that a player s ( pure ) strategy @xmath22 depends only on the degree @xmath18 of the player .",
    "if an agent of degree @xmath18 chooses action 1 in equilibrium , it must be because she does not expect that any of her neighbors will choose action 1 .",
    "therefore , in an uncorrelated network , an agent of degree @xmath23 faces a lower likelihood of an arbitrary neighbor choosing the action 1 , and would be best responding with action 1 as well . in particular@xcite ,",
    "any nash equilibrium is characterized by a threshold @xmath24 , the smallest integer for which @xmath25^\\tau\\ge 1-c,\\ ] ] and an equilibrium @xmath26 must satisfy @xmath27 for all @xmath28 , @xmath29 for all @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath32 is non - increasing ) .",
    "the payoff function here takes the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "strategic complements thus represent a coordination game . as for substitutes , in the case of complete information",
    "there are generally many equilibria ( including the case @xmath35 @xmath36 , which represents full defection ) . also here , by making the assumption that each player is only informed of her own degree and has independent beliefs on the degrees of neighbors , it is possible to find much more definite predictions with regard to equilibrium behavior @xcite .",
    "in particular , independence of neighbor degrees implies that the probability that a random neighbor chooses the action 1 can not depend on one s own degree ( a player s neighbors do not know her degree and , consequently , they can not know whether or not it will be convenient for her to chose action 1 ) , and the expectation of the sum of actions @xmath37 of any agent @xmath3 with @xmath38 neighbors is increasing in @xmath18 .",
    "the structure of payoffs then assures that if a degree @xmath18 agent is choosing the action 1 in equilibrium , any agent of degree greater than @xmath18 must be best responding with the action 1 as well , as she should have as many cooperating neighbors as an agent of degree @xmath23",
    ". therefore every equilibrium is characterized by an integer threshold @xmath24  @xcite such that @xmath39 the equilibrium satisfies @xmath29 for all @xmath28 , @xmath27 for all @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( in particular , @xmath32 is non - decreasing ) .",
    "summing up , for equilibrium strategies played once and for all under complete network information there is no systematic relation between social networks and individual behavior and payoffs .",
    "by contrast , under incomplete network information , both in games of strategic substitutes and of strategic complements , there is a clear cut relation between networks and individual behavior , as decisions can in general be inferred from degrees .",
    "whereas the previous section dealt with bayes - nash equilibria of one - shot strategic games under the settings of complete and incomplete information , here we move to our contribution , namely an evolutionary scenario in which agents play multiple instances of the game , and can adapt their strategy hoping to increase their payoffs .",
    "we resort to an evolutionary game - theoretical approach in which agents do not make strategic considerations about the network s global structure and their position within it ; instead , they base their decision on their own actions / payoffs and on those of neighbors , as observed in the past .",
    "our goal is to study the resulting dynamics of the system as well as its equilibrium configurations , and check whether the system can reach a nash equilibrium , or what is the nature of the steady state if not nash .",
    "the evolutionary system can be described as follows . starting with a fraction @xmath40 of players randomly chosen to undertake action @xmath41 , at each round @xmath42 of the game : players collect their payoff @xmath43given by eq.([eq.ss ] ) and eq.([eq.sc ] ) respectively for strategic substitutes and complements ; then a fraction @xmath44 of players update their strategy .",
    "we consider two different mechanisms for strategy updating .    _",
    "proportional imitation _ ( pi ) @xcite  it represents a rule of imitative nature in which player @xmath3 may copy the strategy of a selected counterpart @xmath45 , which is chosen randomly among the @xmath4 neighbors of @xmath3 .",
    "the probability that @xmath3 copies @xmath45 s strategy depends on the difference between the payoffs that they obtained in the previous round of the game : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a normalization constant that ensures @xmath48 $ ] . note that because of the imitation mechanism of pi , the configurations @xmath49 @xmath36 and @xmath35 @xmath36 are absorbing states  the system can not escape from them .    _ best response _",
    "( br ) @xcite  here players are fully rational and choose their strategy in order to maximize their payoff , given what their neighbors did in the last round .",
    "this means that each player @xmath3 , given @xmath50 , computes the payoffs that she would obtain by choosing action 1 ( cooperating ) or 0 ( defecting ) at time @xmath42 , respectively @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "then @xmath53    we use pi because it is equivalent , for a well - mixed population , to the well - known replicator dynamics @xcite , and br because it is widely used in the economic literature .",
    "we then study how the system evolves starting from the initial random distribution of strategies .",
    "in particular , we want to check whether the system can reach a nash equilibrium ( a state where no player can increase her payoff by unilaterally changing her strategy ) .",
    "note , however , that whereas a nash equilibrium is stable by definition under br dynamics , with pi this is not necessarily true : players can change action by copying better - performing neighbors , even if such change deteriorates their payoffs .",
    "hence in the latter case a potential stationary state of the system does not necessarily correspond to a nash equilibrium ( unless the network is a complete graph @xcite ) .    in what follows we present analytical and numerical results for the system described above . for simulations , without loss of generality we set @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56but our results are valid for all values of these parameters in @xmath57 . to avoid possible trapping into period-2 loops , where all players change action simultaneously at each round of the game , that can arise in anti - coordination under br . ]",
    "we will show averages over @xmath58 independent realizations of the system , an amount that we found enough to tame single - realization fluctuations ( that are however shown with error bars , when visible ) .",
    "note that in numerical simulations , when the system arrives to a nash equilibrium , we change by hand the strategy of a random player in order to continue exploring other strategy configurations .    as stated in the introduction , we consider two representative kinds of population structure .",
    "erds - rnyi ( er ) random graphs  @xcite are built by considering a collection of @xmath0 nodes and adding a link between each pair of nodes with probability @xmath59 .",
    "the resulting networks are homogeneous , with degree distribution decaying exponentially for large degree @xmath18 and the average degree is @xmath60 .",
    "scale - free ( sf ) random networks are generated using a configuration model  @xcite with a constraint @xmath61 , which gives rise to uncorrelated random networks @xcite with degree distribution @xmath62 .",
    "the average degree depends on the network size @xmath0 and converges to a finite value as @xmath0 diverges and @xmath63 , and consider various sizes : @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) , @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) , @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) , @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) .",

    "we now present the results of the numerical simulations .",
    "we recall that in ref .  @xcite we analyzed the evolutionary dynamics for the two games , under the same two evolutionary rules , by resorting to two analytical approaches , the homogeneous mean - field ( mf ) and the heterogeneous mean - field ( hmf ) . while we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for the complete analysis and detailed discussion , we include brief summaries of the analytical predictions in the following , as tools to understand the simulation results .",
    "note that the mf approach , which should work best for homogeneous random graphs , deals with the aggregate density of cooperators @xmath75 , whereas , the hmf , which is more appropriate for heterogeneous networks , involves the computation of the quantity @xmath76 ( _ i.e. _ , the average of the probability @xmath77 that a node of degree @xmath18 cooperates , weighted by the relative degree ) .        in this case",
    ", the mf prediction is that @xmath78^{-1},\\qquad 0<\\rho_0<1.\\ ] ] hence the population converges to the state with no cooperators @xmath79 ( full defection ) , unless the initial state is @xmath80 ( full cooperation ) .",
    "we see from figure [ fig.ss_pi ] that , also in simulations , the system always goes towards the absorbing state @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath81 @xmath82 and the full dynamical evolution is in excellent agreement with the mf theory .",
    "the convergence toward full defection occurs because a defector can not copy a neighboring cooperator ( who has lower payoff by construction ) , whereas a cooperator will eventually copy one of her neighboring defectors ( who has higher payoff ) . however , full defection is not a nash equilibrium as any player surrounded by defectors would do better by cooperating .     for erds - rnyi and scale - free graphs , with @xmath83",

    "for the best - shot game with br dynamics , the mf predicts that the final state is , for any initial condition , a mixed state @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the solution of the equation : @xmath87 the hmf approach leads to an analogous conclusion : the final state is @xmath88 , which is the solution of the equation @xmath89 since br dynamics is guaranteed to lead to nash equilibria , @xmath90 and @xmath88 are the attractors of the dynamics , their values depending only on the average degree of the network ( in particular , they decrease for increasing network connectivity ) but not on @xmath40 , @xmath7 or @xmath44 .     and fraction @xmath91 of unsatisfied players ( _ i.e. _ , who would obtain higher payoff by unilaterally switching action , and with @xmath92 indicating the falling of the system into a nash equilibrium ) for erds - rnyi and scale - free graphs , with @xmath83 ( again , results are independent on the specific value of @xmath0 ) . ]",
    "numerical simulations indeed confirm such a picture : the dynamics finds a rich variety of nash equilibria with intermediate cooperation level @xmath93 ( figure [ fig.ss_br ] ) ; moreover , @xmath93 decreases with increasing network connectivity ( figure  [ fig.ss_br_eq])in agreement with both eq .  ( [ eq.ss_tau ] ) and eq .  ( [ eq.ss_br_2 ] ) .",
    "the key observation to understand the features of such equilibria is that , in best - shot games under br dynamics , a player switches to defection as soon as one of her neighbors is a cooperator , and this happens with higher probability when the player has many social ties ( see also figure  [ fig.ss_br_degree ] ) .",
    "the higher values of @xmath93 in scale - free networks than in erds - rnyi graphs ( of the same link density ) can be explained by the presence , in the first case , of more low - degree nodes  who preferentially cooperate as they have few neighbors to exploit .",

    ", the evolution never converges to a nash equilibrium ",
    "what happens instead is that all players with @xmath103 became satisfied ( _ i.e. _ , they can not increase their payoffs by unilaterally chaniging action ) , but making unsatisfied the others who can not change action .",

    "in fact , the equilibria that are evolutionary selected by our deterministic br - based dynamics are indeed proper nash , whereas , the framework of @xcite is probabilistic and thus selects bayes - nash equilibria .      for coordination games the picture is richer , as the behavior of the system depends on the ratio @xmath104 . without loss of generality ,",

    "[ fig.ss_wp ] ) , the simple case of pi dynamics is totally unaffected by the presence of correlations : the temporal evolution and the asymptotic state do not depend at all on @xmath156 .",
    "instead , when strategies evolve according to br , the dynamics leads to nash equilibria with levels @xmath93 of cooperation ( dominated by the behavior of low - degree nodes ) that decrease with @xmath156 .",

[ fig.sc_wp ] ) .",
    "this can be understood by considering that , in the assortative case , hubs tend to be connected with each other , so that cooperation can spread more easily among them and be sustained by mutual connections : the critical density of stable cooperators decreases . at the same time , low - degree nodes are connected only with each other , so that they require larger values of @xmath105 to sustain cooperation within themselves ( as compared to the uncorrelated case ) . as a result ,",

    "the vertical lines identify the values of @xmath116 . ]    in conclusion , degree - degree correlations of the interaction pattern do not change the qualitative features of the behavior of games on scale - free networks .",
    "in this work we have studied by numerical simulations two kinds of games , namely the best - shot and the coordination games , as representatives of two wide classes of social interactions ( strategic substitutes and strategic complements , respectively ) . in these games ,",
    "the welfare of a player depends both on her own actions and on the actions taken by her partners ; thus , we have considered different topological structures for the pattern of interactions .",
    "we have embedded these games into an evolutionary framework , described by two types of dynamics , widely employed to model evolving populations : proportional imitation , in which players imitate more successful neighbors , and best response , in which players are rational and make optimal choices .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations , determining the attractors of the evolution , and characterizing them in term of nash equilibria . by comparison with the results of numerical simulations",
    "we have assessed the validity of the mean field approaches in describing such systems , and we have also compared our findings with the theoretical predictions of  @xcite about the features of nash equilibria in one - shot games under incomplete information .    generally , we observe that the behavior of the system is highly influenced by the dynamics employed and by the population structure .",
    "strategic substitutes under pi dynamics represents the simplest case , in which full defection is the only accessible ( but non - nash ) equilibrium , whatever the underlying topology , in complete agreement with the mean field predictions .",
    "this suggests that the failure to find a nash equilibrium arises from the ( bounded rational ) dynamics and , with the benefit of hindsight , it is clear that imitation is not a good procedure for players to decide in anti - coordination games .",
    "such a conclusion is supported by the behavior observed for strategic substitutes under br dynamics .",
    "indeed , here we observe many stable nash equilibria , with cooperation level @xmath93 slightly smaller than ( but close to ) the mean field prediction @xmath162 .",
    "moreover , in simulations we observe precisely what is predicted by the mf theory , namely that @xmath93 decreases with increasing network connectivity and does not depend on the initial conditions , game and simulation parameters , and system size ( which was taken as infinite in the analytical calculations ) . concerning the topology ,",
    "@xmath93 is enhanced in heterogeneous networks because of more low - degree nodes who are typically cooperators .",
    "additionally , disassortativity has a positive effect on the cooperation levels , as low - degree nodes are connected to high - degree nodes who are likely to be defectors , and thus tend to cooperate even more .",
    "vice versa , assortativity allows more low - degree nodes to defect .",
    "the picture is far more rich and interesting for strategic complements , that feature an additional parameter @xmath105 playing a key role in determining which equilibria are dynamically accessible . indeed , in the case of pi for erds - rnyi random graphs we observe two kinds of stationary states : fully defective nash equilibria for @xmath163 , and full cooperation for @xmath164 ( that becomes nash equilibrium only when @xmath111 ) .",
    "remarkably , @xmath117 for @xmath165 , where @xmath166 is the value predicted by the mf theory .",
    "we thus see that imitation is indeed a good procedure to choose actions in a coordination setup : pi does lead to nash equilibria , and indeed it makes a very precise prediction : a unique equilibrium that depends on the initial density .",
    "if the topology is scale - free , hmf theory and simulations agree on @xmath115 and @xmath116 going to zero for @xmath72 , indicating that in these cases cooperation emerges also when the incentive to cooperate vanishes .",
    "the situation with br dynamics is rather similar to the case of pi , with the single difference that for erds - rnyi random graphs and @xmath110 the stationary state is now a nash equilibrium , and again full cooperation is achieved for @xmath111 .",
    "thus we see that , with br , equilibria with intermediate values of the density of cooperators are obtained in a range of initial densities .",
    "compared to the situation with pi , in which we only find the absorbing states as equilibria , this points to the fact that more rational players can eventually converge to equilibria with higher payoffs .",
    "finally , we have found that , whatever the dynamics , the presence of topological correlations in the network does not change the global qualitative picture .    besides the general features of the dynamics , we have also been able to study the degree - dependent features of nash equilibria ( when present ) and compare our findings with the theoretical predictions of @xcite , in the which authors consider games played once and for all but using only partial information on the underlying topology .",
    "our conclusion is that , while the nash equilibria predicted in @xcite can not ( always ) be reached , their theory still provides good guidance on the shape and features of the nash equilibria which are evolutionarily accessible .",
    "finally , it is interesting to note that , as in @xcite , we find that the outcome of the evolution depends on the dynamics and the network properties .",
    "remarkably , here we go beyond those works as our study of individual behaviors allows us to make a connection with the results obtained in a more traditional economic framework .",
