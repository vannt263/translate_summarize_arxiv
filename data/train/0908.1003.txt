    "luminous stars of ob and wolf - rayet ( wr ) spectral types drive fast , dense , ionized winds with mass - loss rates that are high enough to significantly affect their evolution and their surroundings .",
    "the winds emit free - free radiation over a wide range of wavelengths , from cm emission in the radio band , to @xmath1 m emission in the near - infra - red . since the bremsstrahlung opacity is proportional to the square of the wavelength , the observed emission originates above a characteristic radius that increases with wavelength ( typical values are @xmath2 at 20 cm ( 1.5ghz ) , and @xmath3 at 1 mm ( 300ghz ) ) . at wavelengths where the wind is optically thick",
    ", the thermal emission can be used to determine stellar mass - loss rates .",

    "wind asphericity typically does not alter radio derived mass - loss rates by more than a factor of two @xcite .",
    "the free - free flux is expected to behave like @xmath4 , where the spectral index @xmath5 at cm wavelengths @xcite",
    ". however , the spectral index of `` thermal '' sources at shorter ( mm and far - infrared ) wavelengths increases to around @xmath6 to @xmath7 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several possible causes for this steepening have been suggested , including a decrease of the wind temperature or the ionization state with radius or an increase of the wind speed with radius @xcite .",
    "however , since temperature gradients only weakly affect the flux through the gaunt factor , while the wind speed changes relatively little between the cm and mm emitting regions , these effects are unable to explain the difference between theoretical and observed spectral indices between cm and mm wavelengths . @xcite also noted that deviations from the expected behaviour `` should not easily be blamed '' on non - spherical winds .",
    "this led both @xcite and @xcite to suggest a gradient in ionization as the most likely cause .",
    "another possibility involves a radial variation of the degree of clumping within the wind .",
    "for instance , an excess of mm emission over that expected from scaling the radio emission to shorter wavelengths can be caused by a decline in the degree of clumping between the regions of the wind emitting at mm and cm wavelengths @xcite .",
    "@xcite have also argued for models which combine clumping and a highly ionized outer wind region .",
    "a recent review of small - scale structure in massive star winds can be found in @xcite .    at very high frequencies ,",
    "the photospheric emission , which is rapidly rising , begins to dominate the emission from the wind .",
    "this transition occurs at roughly the same frequency as the whole wind becomes optically thin .",
    "the intrinsic thermal spectrum from the wind only then flattens , as the emission then arises from essentially a blackbody of constant projected linear radius @xmath8 at all frequencies greater than the critical value given by eq .  12 of @xcite .",
    "however , the dominance of the photospheric emission means that observationally the emission retains a strong wavelength dependence .",
    "the presence of a companion star may also change the observed thermal flux , its spectral index , and the inferred mass - loss rates .",
    "first , there are now two stars , rather than one , and the winds of both will contribute to the observed emission .",
    "moreover , the interaction of the winds may also produce significant free - free emission .",
    "@xcite investigated the total thermal flux from a wide colliding winds binary ( cwb ) as a function of the wind momentum ratio , and discovered that it could be about 50 per cent higher than that expected from the more massive wind alone .",
    "in more recent work , @xcite investigated the emission from an adiabatic wcr , where the plasma in the wcr remains at high temperature as it flows out of the system , as a function of the stellar separation , @xmath9 . if the wcr remains optically thin , the thermal flux scales as @xmath10",
    "moreover , since optically thin emission scales as @xmath11 , the flux from the wcr may dominate the thermal flux from the system , particularly at cm wavelengths .",
    "however , there has been no investigation to date of the thermal emission from systems where the wcr is highly radiative .",
    "this situation clearly needs to be addressed .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the thermal radio to sub - mm emission from short period o+o - star binaries computed from the three - dimensional hydrodynamical models described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) .",
    "we aim to illuminate the relative contribution of the wcr to the total free - free flux , the effect that this may have on the observed spectral index , and the size and nature of orbital related variations , for a variety of models where the behaviour of the plasma in the wcr is either highly radiative or largely adiabatic .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows .",
    "we briefly describe in section  [ sec : hydro ] the hydrodynamical models and in section  [ sec : setup ] our method of calculating the thermal cm to sub - mm emission . in section  [ sec : results ] we present our results , focussing first on calculations of the emission from the wind of a single star , and then on calculations based on our binary models . in section  [ sec : discussion ]",

    "we use the model developed by @xcite and @xcite to determine the thermal radio to sub - mm emission from each of our colliding winds simulations .",
    "detailed notes on our method can be found in these papers , but the salient points are summarized below .    to calculate the radio emission we read our hydrodynamical models into a radiative transfer ray - tracing code , and calculate appropriate emission and absorption coefficients for each cell . a synthetic image on the plane of the sky",
    "is then generated by solving the radiative transfer equation along suitable lines of sight through the grid .",
    "the thermal emission ( @xmath12 ) and absorption ( @xmath13 ) coefficients at frequency @xmath14 are given by @xcite as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the mean ionic charge , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are electron and ion number densities , @xmath19 is the temperature of the gas , and @xmath20 is a velocity averaged gaunt factor @xcite .",
    "all quantities are in cgs units .",
    "the densities @xmath17 and @xmath21 are determined from the cell density , composition and ionization , where the ionization is specified as a function of cell temperature .",
    "the appropriate ionization for a particular temperature regime is determined and the absorption and emission coefficients are then evaluated .",
    "the unshocked winds are assumed to be isothermal at @xmath22k , and each model is assumed to be at a distance of 1kpc .    in the majority of the models in this work we assume that the winds are smooth ( i.e. not clumped ) .",
    "this enables the characteristic radius of emission and the @xmath23 surface to better fit within our hydrodynamical grids , at the expense of underestimating the emission compared to real systems where the winds are often strongly clumped .",
    "our assumption of smooth winds also removes the need to specify the radial stratification of the clump volume filling factor , @xmath24 , which remains poorly known ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "table  [ tab : radio_params ] lists the characteristic radius , @xmath25 , and flux density , @xmath26 , of free - free emission from our model o6v star at various frequencies between 5 and 2000ghz ( corresponding to wavelengths between 6 cm and 150@xmath1 m ) . the radius of optical depth unity , @xmath27 .",
    "all of the hydrodynamical grids in our models are large enough to contain the characteristic radius for free - free emission at @xmath28ghz , while models cwb2 and cwb3 are also able to contain the characteristic radius for emission at @xmath29ghz ( compare table  [ tab : radio_params ] with table  3 in paper  i ) .",
    "this enables us to explore the thermal radio emission from these systems , in addition to the x - ray emission explored in a previous paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  iii ) .    clumping increases the emission and absorption coefficients in eqs .",

    "this means that the flux from a model with a given @xmath33 and @xmath24 , if interpreted as arising from a wind with no clumping , gives ( incorrectly ) the mass - loss rate @xmath34 ( note that one can also take an alternative approach : a particular observed flux can be translated into a mass - loss rate @xmath35 assuming that there is no clumping , or a mass - loss rate @xmath36 , assuming that there is clumping ) .",
    "however , even when the stellar winds are clumpy , the wcr may be considerably less so .",
    "this is expected to be the case when the postshock gas behaves largely adiabatically . in such situations",
    "the destruction time of the clumps can be significantly shorter than the flow time of the shocked gas out of the system , and the wcr , though highly turbulent , is noticeably smoother than the stellar winds ( see * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , in previous work @xcite we have assumed that the winds are clumpy and the wcr is smooth(er ) .    in this work",
    "we also investigate the emission assuming clumpy winds with @xmath37 , but a wcr which is smoother to varying degrees i.e. @xmath38 .",
    "this provides more realistic fluxes from the unshocked winds and insight into how clumping in different regions of the system affects the observed lightcurves and spectra .",
    "in these models the coefficients in eqs .",

    "is obtained from our solution to the modified cak equations @xcite . at high frequencies the emission arises from within the acceleration zone of the wind , and it is no longer possible to use , e.g. , eq .  8 in @xcite to evaluate the flux .",
    "we therefore numerically integrate the flux as a function of impact parameter , following the method of @xcite .",
    "the wind is assumed to begin at the point where the outflow velocity is equal to the isothermal sound speed , which is @xmath41 in our models . as in the binary models which follow",
    "we assume that the wind is smooth , isothermal and maintains a constant ionization : these assumptions allow us to isolate the effect of the wind acceleration on the resulting emission .",
    "we also include the photospheric flux , which is modelled as a black body for simplicity .",

    "the total emission is dominated by the wind and arises from large distances where the wind has very nearly reached its terminal speed . the spectral index ( fig .",
    "[ fig : singlestar_spec_tau]b ) is near @xmath0 , as expected .",
    "the emission starts to probe the acceleration region of the wind at @xmath42ghz , where a steepening of the spectrum becomes apparent .",

    "in contrast , the sharp increase in the wind density of the cak model as the photosphere is approached results in a steep rise in the thermal flux . at frequencies around @xmath43hz ( @xmath44 ) , the spectral index of the emission from the _ wind _ steepens to reach a maximum of @xmath45 .",
    "this steepening is due purely to the observed emission occuring from regions where the wind is rapidly accelerating .",

    "it is immediately apparent that the wcr dominates the emission , even at a frequency as high as 1thz .",

    "nevertheless , these images , and the lightcurves and spectra which follow , provide important new insight into the emission at cm and sub - mm wavelengths from cwbs .",
    "the spatial scale of the images is 1.12 by 1.12mas , which is too small to be resolved with the evla ( angular resolution of 4mas at 50ghz ) or alma ( highest angular resolution expected to be about 10mas ) .",
    "in contrast , the vlba has the necessary spatial resolution , but even with all current upgrade plans may struggle with the necessary sensitivity to obtain images of this system within a reasonable integration time ( e.g. 10hrs ) to avoid smearing of the essential features due to orbital motion . in 10hrs , with 256mbit / s bandwidth at 43ghz , the vlba + gbt + phased - vla obtains a sensitivity of 0.029mjy / beam .",
    "bandwidth improvements to 4gbit / s will increase the sensitivity by a factor of 4 . a signal to noise ratio ( snr ) of 5 ( the minimum needed to provide imaging constraints ) in 10hrs thus requires a flux of 0.0725mjy / beam .",
    "the spatial resolution at 43ghz is @xmath78mas , so each arm of the wcr falls within a beam ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cwb1_radio_image ] ) , which is roughly 50 per cent of the total flux , or 0.02mjy .",
    "hence a 10hr exposure is insufficient to obtain a snr of 5 - instead @xmath79hrs is required .",
    "having said this , it has already been noted that there is a significant loss of flux at such frequencies from model cwb1 due to the finite size of the hydrodynamical grid , so the future detection of such a system with the vlba is not totally beyond the realm of possibility ( e.g. if the flux from model cwb1 at 43ghz was actually @xmath80 higher ) .",
    "systems with stronger winds ( higher mass - loss rates ) than assumed for model cwb1 may further improve the possibility of such imaging .    fig .",

    "the stars are aligned along the lines - of - sight at phases 0.0 and 0.5 , and are at quadrature at phases 0.25 and 0.75 .",
    "the variations in flux are entirely due to changes in the occultation and circumstellar absorption , as the intrinsic emission is constant .",
    "note that the presence of the companion star breaks the spherical symmetry of the unshocked winds .",
    "for example , because of the twin radiation fields , the winds accelerate more slowly towards each other , and more quickly away from each other .",
    "there are also regions of lower velocity wind in the `` shadows '' behind each star ( see paper  i for further details ) .",
    "the lightcurves of the wcr emission ( right panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : cwb1_ffradio_lc ] ) would display dual symmetry about phases corresponding to both quadrature ( 0.25 , 0.75 ) and conjunction ( 0 , 0.5 ) if there were no orbital effects on the wcr ( i.e. no aberration or coriolis induced curvature - cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , because of the equal winds and constant stellar separation .",
    "orbital effects break the symmetry about quadrature , so that in the case of identical winds a double periodicity in the lightcurve is expected .",

    "[ fig : cwb1_ffradio_lc ] .    at the lower frequencies the flux from the unshocked winds is typically only a small fraction of the expected combined flux from the winds ( see the horizontal red lines across the plots in the middle column of fig .  [",

    "for instance , at 43ghz the thermal flux from a single smooth ( unclumped ) wind of the same parameters as used in model cwb1 is 0.017mjy , while the combined unshocked winds contribution in fig .",

    "[ fig : cwb1_ffradio_lc](b ) and  ( e ) is likely due to the removal of a large fraction of the unshocked material from both of the winds by the presence of the wcr .",
    "in contrast , at the highest frequencies considered ( 250 and 1000ghz ) , the characteristic radius of emission moves so close to the surface of the stars ( particularly at 1000ghz ) that the emission from this region is not strongly disturbed by the presence of the wcr at larger distances .",
    "a small additional effect at the lowest frequencies arises from the limited extent of the computational grid compared to the characteristic radius of emission , which causes an underestimate of the flux .",

    "the combined flux from the unshocked winds is @xmath85mjy , which actually slightly exceeds twice the theoretical value of 0.095mjy for our single star .",

    "slight maxima occur near to quadrature , with minima near to conjunction , as expected .",

    "therefore , a perfect occultation by two stars with stellar winds is not possible , and hence a dip of 50 per cent is never reached . an additional ( smaller ) part may be played by the fact that the winds are no longer spherically symmetric , since their acceleration is inhibited towards each other , but is boosted in other directions .",

    "second , the reduced radius of the optical depth unity surface in the o8v wind creates a smaller silhouette against the brighter wcr than occurs in model cwb2 .    differences also occur at other viewing angles . at phase 0.125 ( @xmath138 ) , the wcr is seen mostly face on , with the foreground o8v wind silhouetted against it ( slightly to the right of centre ) .",
    "the vertical curvature of the wcr is again clear at phase 0.25 ( quadrature ) , reflecting the wrapping of the wcr around the o8v star ( to the right of centre ) due to the stronger wind from the o6v star ( to the left of centre ) .",

    "[ fig : cwb3_radio_image2 ] which show the first half of the orbit .",
    "however , some small differences are seen , which lead also to differences in the lightcurves .",
    "for example , the conjunction at phase 0.5 now has the denser o6v wind in the foreground , whereas the weaker o8v wind was in front of the wcr at phase 0.0 .",

    "the slight differences in the total flux and the morphology of the variation have their origin in the slighter weaker secondary wind in model cwb3 .",
    "the maxima now show asymmetrical peaks due to the different wind strengths .",

    "we see the emission regions of the two winds ( located very close to the stellar surfaces due to the high frequency ) , plus between them emission from the hot wcr .",
    "there are also small but very bright regions of emission within and close to the wcr .",

    "most of the dense , cold , gas which formed during this time has now been cleared out of the inner parts of the system .",
    "the dense clump and its tail visible in the top left of the image are actually located outside of the wcr , since the high inertia of the clumps causes them to move on almost ballistic trajectories , while the hot gas in the wcr responds more rapidly to the changing positions of the stars ( see paper  i for more details ) .",

    "the density within the wcr steadily increases as the stellar separation reduces , resulting in brighter emission from the wcr , so that by phase 0.95 the apex of the wcr is brighter than the unshocked winds themselves , despite the high frequency ! the spatial distribution of the emission from the wcr also reflects the wcr s increasing curvature as periastron is approached .    by periastron the gas in the densest parts of the wcr in model cwb4 has undergone substantial radiative cooling .",

    "this plasma is optically thin to emission above @xmath145ghz , and its emission coefficient is much smaller than that of the optically thick cold gas nearer the apex of the wcr .",
    "the wide variation in plasma density and temperature throughout the wcr demonstrates that models of the emission from such systems _ must _ be based on time - dependent hydrodynamical calculations .",
    "even more mass within the wcr has cooled back to the wind temperature ( @xmath146k ) by phase 0.05 .",
    "newly shocked gas in the wcr becomes largely adiabatic by phase 0.2 , as the stars continue to separate and the pre - shock velocity of the winds increases .",
    "no new clumps form after this phase until the next periastron passage .",
    "instead , the slow process of clearing the existing clumps out of the system begins .",
    "it is likely that the majority of the emission between orbital phase @xmath147 is captured by the numerical grid , but it is clear that significant flux losses occur from the simulation between phase @xmath148 as optically thick clumps leave the finite boundaries of the grid .",
    "this effect is likely to be greatest at the lower frequencies since the clumps stay optically thicker for greater outflow distances , and should be kept in mind when examining the remaining figures in this section .",
    "[ fig : cwb4_ffradio_lc ] displays lightcurves of the free - free emission from model cwb4 .",
    "since the typical temperature of the plasma in the wcr varies between `` cold '' near periastron , and `` hot '' for the rest of the orbit ( excepting the dense clumps formed within the wcr ) , we have chosen to separately identify the emission from cold ( @xmath149k ) and hot ( @xmath150k ) gas , rather than from the unshocked winds and the wcr . at times",
    "when the wcr is hot ( such as at apastron ) , this leads to the same identification of gas as in the previous sections .",
    "however , during the small range in phases around periastron , our analysis groups the cold gas within the wcr with the unshocked gas from the winds , rather than with the hotter parts of the wcr on the leading arms and downstream .",
    "hence , the `` cold '' and `` hot '' components can not be directly compared to the `` winds '' and `` wcr '' components from model cwb1 , although as noted above it is still reasonable to compare to model cwb2 at other phases .",
    "note that fig .",
    "[ fig : cwb4_ffradio_lc ] shows _ observed _ fluxes , so , for example , the contribution of hot material to the flux includes absorption from overlying cold material in the circumstellar environment .",
    "[ fig : cwb4_ffradio_lc ] shows that the emission typically reaches a maximum around periastron , as was already obvious from the images at @xmath151ghz and @xmath99 , presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : cwb4_radio_image ] .",
    "the varying circumstellar absorption due to the passage of the stars in front of the wcr complicates the interpretation of the lightcurves when the observer is in the orbital plane .",
    "therefore , we shall concentrate on the lightcurve for an observer at @xmath99 . at 43ghz the emission peaks just prior to periastron , while at 1000ghz the maximum occurs just after periastron .",
    "there are two reasons for this behaviour .",
    "one reason is related to the changes with orbital phase of the optical depth of sightlines through the wcr , and is discussed in more detail below .",
    "a minimum centered on phase 0.1 also occurs in the 43ghz lightcurve - this is primarily due to the high optical depth of the cold dense plasma formed in the wcr during the periastron passage .",
    "most of the emission from this material is therefore absorbed . by phase 0.3",
    "many parts of the wcr become optically thin , and the emission from background material starts to become visible .",
    "however , the emissivity of this material is also dropping , and this becomes the dominant factor affecting the observed flux at subsequent phases .",
    "the 43ghz emission reaches a minimum around phase @xmath152 , and then subsequently increases as the stars approach each other , due to the increase in density of the hot plasma in the wcr .",
    "in contrast , the 1000ghz lightcurve of the total emission ( fig .  [",
    "fig : cwb4_ffradio_lc]j ) does not display a minimum at phase 0.1 .",

    "[ fig : cwb4_ffradio_lc]l ) . it is also partly because some of the emission at 1000ghz is from the unshocked stellar winds ( which is responsible for some of the emission seen in fig .",

    "the `` winds '' flux from model cwb2 is about three times greater than the `` cold '' flux from model cwb4 , while the `` wcr '' flux is more than an order of magnitude greater than the `` hot '' flux .",
    "this lack of emission from model cwb4 at the lower frequencies reflects the smaller grid compared to that of model cwb2 .    since a large fraction of the emission from the wcr is optically thick at periastron , it is not surprising to find that the spectral index of the `` hot '' emission at phase 1.0 becomes positive like the unshocked winds ( @xmath153 between 15 and 100ghz - see fig .",
    "[ fig : cwb4_radio_spectrum_index]b ) .",

    "conversely , the emission from the `` cold '' component is significantly bolstered by the substantial amount of gas which has cooled within the wcr , being @xmath154 more luminous at 100ghz than the emission at periastron .",

    "although some parts of the wcr remain hot even at periastron ( for instance the leading edge of the shocks ) , the majority of the mass within the wcr is optically thick at phases 0.0 and 0.1 . at the highest frequencies considered , the wcr is only marginally optically thick at phase 0.1 , with the optical depth through its surface occasionally exceeding unity , but more typically being less than this .",
    "the wcr becomes increasingly optically thin thereafter , as the stars continue their separation .    just as the flux from the hot part of the wcr varies with phase , so does the contribution from the unshocked winds plus cold parts of the wcr . at phase 0.5",

    "the extra emission becomes more extended in its range of frequencies as more and more gas passing through the wcr cools back to the temperature of the unshocked winds , and reaches its maximum contribution at phase 0.1 , with @xmath158 as much flux from cold gas compared to phase 0.5 at 200ghz .",
    "thereafter the bump declines as the cold plasma in the wcr is ablated and/or expelled out of the system , so that the `` cold '' spectrum is almost entirely generated by emission from the unshocked winds by apastron .",

    "bearing in mind that our simulations likely underestimate the true flux from this system between phase @xmath148 , it nevertheless reveals that there is a strong hystersis to the emission at all frequencies .",
    "it is also interesting that at low frequencies the emission is stronger as the stars approach periastron , whereas at high frequencies the emission is stronger as the stars recede from periastron .",
    "this is because at low frequencies the winds are very opaque and the emission most easily escapes when the wcr is full of hot plasma , which is the case in the second half of the orbit .",

    "the total flux from model cwb4 always exceeds twice the expected single star value .",
    "this is again because the characteristic region of emission is now close enough to the stars that the wcr no longer `` cuts '' out significant parts of this region . at phase 0.5",
    "the extra emission from the wcr , which is mostly from hot gas , is negligible ( see fig .  [",

    "@xcite suggested the variability might indicate the presence of a time - variable non - thermal component , and/or changes to the underlying mass - loss rate or velocity of the wind .",

    "it is likely that the observed variability is related to the binarity of these systems . @xcite",
    "also note that the radio emission from wr98a and wr104 ( two of the so - called `` pinwheel '' systems ) is variable and the spectral index is positive , but less than the value expected from a single wind ( i.e. @xmath196 ) .",
    "these systems could harbour non - thermal emission ( i.e. be `` composite '' systems ) , or the emission could be purely thermal , combining optically thick emission from the winds with optically thin emission from the wcr .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the broad maxima seen in the lightcurves of model cwb1 are similar to those seen in the radio lightcurve of the lbv @xmath197carinae @xcite .",
    "the latter is usually explained in terms of time - variable ionization of dense gas within the spoked equatorial disc seen in the optical ( see also * ? ? ?",

    ", this corresponds to thousands of au . however , 3-dimensional simulations of the structure of the wcr reveals density enhancements on similar spatial scales @xcite .",
    "thus , it is possible that at least some of the variability could be due to time variations in the properties and orientation of the optically thick shocked wind of the primary lbv star .",
    "furthermore , @xmath197car showed a sharp peak in the 7 mm flux density in 2003.5 ( and again in 2009.0 , abraham , private communication , 2009 ) , coinciding with periastron passage @xcite .",
    "this spike has been interpreted as the shocked plasma from the secondary wind becoming optically thick at high temperatures @xcite .",

    "in contrast , at high frequencies ( @xmath198ghz ) , the greatest flux from model cwb4 occurs after periastron . at such frequencies , the majority of the unshocked winds is optically thin , allowing the bright emission from the cold dense clumps created during periastron passage to be seen .",

    "this work examines the _ thermal _ radio - to - sub - mm emission from colliding wind binaries , focussing in this first instance on short - period o+o binaries ( the potential _ non - thermal _ emission will be studied in due course ) .",
    "we investigate how the _ thermal _ emission is influenced by the presence of a nearby companion star , and the extent to which variability with orbital phase occurs .",
    "the emission is calculated from grids of density and temperature generated from the 3d hydrodynamical models presented in @xcite .",
    "the models span a variety of different physical conditions , including radiative and adiabatic wind - wind collision regions in systems with circular orbits , and also a system with an eccentric orbit where the wcr repeatedly cycles from radiative to adiabatic and back to radiative again .",
    "we find distinct differences in the spectra and lightcurves from systems with radiative and adiabatic wcr s . in the former ( model cwb1 ) , the wcr is optically thick to wavelengths as short as sub - mm , and radiates as a dense sheet of emission .",
    "the wcr dominates the total emission from the system , and only begins to show signs of becoming optically thin at @xmath121ghz . the flux ( which has a positive spectral index ) can be over an order of magnitude greater than from the wind of a single star , and highlights potentially serious consequences for observational estimates of mass - loss rates where sources are assumed to be single stars , but are in fact binaries .",
    "the flux is highest just before quadrature , when the inner regions of the wcr are viewed almost face on ( due to the large aberration of the wcr ) , and have the largest projected extent .",
    "the lightcurve maxima are broad , with minima occuring slightly before conjunction .",
    "for an observer in the orbital plane , the total flux ( from the unshocked winds plus the wcr ) varies by a factor of two or so .",
    "although there is some loss of flux from the models , the spectral index of the emission is likely to be steeper than + 0.6 , and varies with orbital phase and the orientation of the observer .",
    "synthetic images for an observer directly above the orbital plane display an `` s''-shaped region of emission which traces the location of the wcr .",
    "in contrast , the emission from adiabatic wcr s is optically thin , and most easily escapes the system when sight - lines to the observer are themselves through the wcr . in model cwb2",
    "the wcr dominates the emission at @xmath199ghz , with free - free absorption creating a low frequency turnover typically at @xmath200ghz .",
    "the emission from the wcr typically contributes only 10 per cent of the total flux at 1000ghz ( 0.3 mm ) .",
    "the lightcurves show relatively narrow maxima at phases just after quadrature .",
    "the broad , and relatively flat minima inbetween the maxima indicate phases where there is considerable absorption of the emission from the wcr .",
    "there is a gradual drop in the degree of variability with frequency as the circumstellar environment becomes less opaque and increasingly transparent . at 1000ghz the vast majority of the wcr emission escapes the system . between 100 and 250ghz , the lightcurves",
    "change morphology . at @xmath201ghz ,",
    "the maxima become almost completely flat - topped , and the minima are now caused by occultation of a narrow emission region near the surface of each star .",
    "the spectral index is steepest at low frequencies ( where absorption of emission from the wcr is important ) and at high frequencies ( where the emission is almost entirely from deep within the acceleration region of the individual winds ) .",
    "images of the emission for an observer in the orbital plane reveal an intertwined `` double - helix '' showing limb - brightened parts of the wcr , against which the foreground wind is sometimes silhouetted . at other viewing angles ( e.g. @xmath118 )",
    "an `` s''-shaped region of emission is again seen .",
    "adiabatic systems where one of the winds is weaker than the other generally display similar properties , the main differences being slight asymmetries to the lightcurves ( e.g. differing heights to the maxima ) , and a change from a `` double - helix '' emission structure to a single limb - brightened structure emitted by the relatively dense trailing edge of the trailing arm of the wcr .",
    "one of the more surprising findings in this work is the strength of the flux variations with orbital phase from a system with an eccentric orbit ( model cwb4 ) , which exceed an order of magnitude from the wcr ) , and may be almost as strong from the system as a whole .",
    "this is caused by dramatic changes to the physical properties of the wcr , which is highly radiative at periastron , but adiabatic at apastron , and changes from optically thick to optically thin , respectively .",
    "this creates a strong frequency - dependent hystersis to the emission around the orbit . at low frequencies",
    "the emission is stronger as the stars approach periastron , due to the low opacity through the hot wcr at this time .",
    "the flux variations easily exceed the @xmath10 scaling proposed by @xcite , which is invalidated by changes to the pre - shock wind speeds as the stars orbit deep within the acceleration zone of each other s wind .",
    "in contrast , at high frequencies the emission is stronger as the stars recede from periastron , because of the high intrinsic emission from dense , cold , post - shock gas created during periastron passage .",
    "even larger variations are seen when the observer is in the orbital plane , indicating that changes in the circumstellar absorption also play an important role .",
    "an examination of the effects of clumping reveal that in addition to higher fluxes , clumping can also effect the variability of radio lightcurves . in the case of strong clumping in the unshocked winds but a smooth wcr ,",
    "the variability decreases .",
    "however , if the clumps are not smoothed by the wcr ( a case which we consider rather unlikely ) , the variations of the flux with orbital phase can be enhanced compared to the smooth winds case .",
    "we find that the fluxes from our models are consistent with the mostly upper limits which exist to date from the o+o systems which they most resemble . on the other hand",
    ", there are many instances where radio variability is observed from wr sources with positive spectral indices , some with @xmath193 .",
    "many of these sources are likely to be binaries , with the variation linked to changes in the absorption through the circumstellar material , as the orientation of the system to the observer changes , or perhaps due to changes in the separation of the stars .",
    "however , we also caution that systems with positive spectral indices are not necessarily thermal - instead , one could be witnessing the absorption of a non - thermal component .",
    "this possibility must be carefully considered , especially if the spectral index is calculated at relatively low frequencies ( e.g. between 5 and 8ghz ) . to safely distinguish between thermal and non - thermal emission in close , spatially unresolved systems where the spectral index is positive",
    "may require flux measurements over a wide frequency range , additional observations at x - ray and @xmath191-ray energies , and detailed comparisons with theoretical models .",
    "it is difficult to predict how the fluxes from the models investigated in this work will scale to other systems ( e.g. wr+o systems ) , since there are so many key variables , such as whether the wcr is optically thick or thin , the recent thermal history of the plasma in the wcr , the relative sizes of the radio photospheres in each wind to the stellar separation , the orientation of the system , etc . in many ways this work , in revealing some of these complications , demonstrates that it may not always be valid to apply some of the scaling laws noted in @xcite and @xcite . in this respect",
    "there is a clear need for further numerical simulations of cwbs with a range of key parameters ( mass - loss rates , stellar separations , etc . ) .",
    "such simulations will aid the study and interpretation of the resulting emission from these fascinating systems .",
    "the future commissioning of more sensitive telescopes , such as the evla , e - merlin , alma , and ska , should result in detections of short - period o+o systems , thus allowing the predictions of this work to be tested .",
    "although the synthetic images shown in this work are of an angular scale which is too small to be resolved with evla or alma , planned upgrades to the vlba offer the exciting prospect of spatially resolving the emission from tight cwbs .",
    "the evla , alma , and other facilities may also resolve some of the wider o+o ( and wr+o ) cwbs .",

    "<S> in this work the _ thermal _ emission over cm to sub - mm wavelengths from the winds in short - period o+o - star binaries is investigated ( potential _ non - thermal _ emission is presently ignored ) . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations are based on three - dimensional hydrodynamical models which incorporate gravity , the driving of the winds , orbital motion of the stars , and radiative cooling of the shocked plasma . </S>",
    "<S> the _ thermal _ emission arises from the stellar winds and the region where they collide . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the flux and spectrum from a variety of models as a function of orbital phase and orientation of the observer , and compare to the single star case . </S>",
    "<S> the emission from the wind - wind collision region ( wcr ) is strongly dependent on its density and temperature , being optically thick in radiative systems , and optically thin in adiabatic systems . </S>",
    "<S> the flux from systems where the wcr is highly radiative , as investigated for the first time in this work , can be over an order of magnitude greater than the combined flux from identically typed single stars . </S>",
    "<S> this excess occurs over a broad range of wavelengths from cm to sub - mm . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , when the wcr is largely adiabatic , a significant excess in the thermal flux occurs only below 100ghz .    in circular systems with ( near ) </S>",
    "<S> identical stars the observed variability in synthetic lightcurves is typically less than a factor of 2 . </S>",
    "<S> eccentric systems may show order of magnitude or greater flux variability , especially if the plasma in the wcr transitions from an adiabatic to a radiative state and vice - versa - in such cases the flux can display significant hysteresis with stellar separation . </S>",
    "<S> we further demonstrate that clumping can affect the variability of radio lightcurves .    </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the spectral index of the emission , and often find indices steeper than @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> synthetic images display a variety of morphologies , with the emission sometimes resembling an intertwined `` double - helix '' . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude by comparing our results to observations . </S>",
    "<S> the predictions made in this paper are of interest to future observations with the next generation of radio and sub - mm telescopes , including the evla , e - merlin , alma , and the ska , and future upgrades to the vlba .    </S>",
