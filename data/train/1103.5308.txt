    "the very first alice physics results from the @xmath1  tev pb - pb collisions at the lhc were the elliptic flow @xcite , multiplicities @xcite , as well as the transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) spectrum of charged particles @xcite . in the measured charged - particle @xmath0 spectrum , which covers",
    "the range @xmath4  gev and extends over three orders of magnitude , two quite distinct regions can be seen for the centralmost collisions : at @xmath5  gev the spectrum is exponential , while at @xmath6  gev it shows a power - law like behaviour . both of these carry very important information on the qcd dynamics of the system : the low-@xmath0 spectrum , responsible for the hadronic bulk multiplicity , reflects the collective transverse motion ( flow ) developed in the system during its entire spacetime evolution , while the high-@xmath0 spectrum , and its suppression relative to the yield in proton - proton collisions , tells us about energy losses of high transverse momentum ( @xmath7 ) partons on their way out of the dense bulk matter .    in this paper , our goal is to make a simultaneous analysis of the high- and low-@xmath0 parts of the charged - hadron @xmath0 spectrum measured by the alice collaboration @xcite in pb - pb collisions , based on models which have been successfully applied and constrained in au - au collisions at rhic . while the extrapolation of the pqcd parts from @xmath3  gev to 2.76  tev is straightforward , the nonperturbative features in bulk dynamics and its connection to partonic energy loss contain considerable uncertainties .",
    "a generally accepted framework for describing the bulk qcd - matter evolution in @xmath8-@xmath8 collisions , is relativistic hydrodynamics , which at the same time is the only framework which can incorporate the effects of the phase transition predicted by lattice",
    "there has been considerable progress in the hydrodynamical modeling of ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions over the last years , and into many directions , too : one has moved from solving 1 + 2 dimensional boost symmetric ideal hydrodynamical equations @xcite to genuinely 1 + 3 d ideal hydrodynamics @xcite , and to 1 + 2 d @xcite and even 1 + 3 d dissipative hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "furthermore , various hybrid models have recently been developed , where the hydrodynamical evolution is coupled with a hadronic cascade afterburner @xcite .",
    "also genuine event - by - event hydrodynamic studies have been performed , both in the ideal hydrodynamics @xcite as well as in the viscous case @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamics itself does not provide any prescription for the extrapolation in @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath9 dependence of bulk dynamics enters mainly via the initial conditions ( ic ) which are crucial element in these studies .",
    "one can try to fit the ic using the available data ( multiplicities , @xmath0 spectra , elliptic flow ) as constraints .",
    "then , however , the more fitting is done the more one looses in predictive power . to improve upon this",
    ", the ic may be computable using a dynamical model for primary production of qcd quanta , which provides the needed @xmath9 dependence .",
    "one such initial - state model , which we will employ in this paper , is the pqcd + saturation approach , the `` ekrt model '' @xcite .",
    "when combined with ideal hydrodynamics , this model correctly predicted the charged - hadron multiplicities in @xmath10 , 130 and 200 gev au - au collisions at rhic , and within 7 % also at the lhc @xcite",
    ". also the centrality dependence of the multiplicity is consistent with the data , see fig .",
    "23(a ) in @xcite and fig .",
    "4 in @xcite , and the measured @xmath0 spectra of the bulk of the identified hadrons at rhic have been reproduced well in this framework @xcite .",
    "elliptic flow has also been successfully addressed @xcite , and in particular , the similarity of the differential elliptic flow at rhic and lhc as well as the increase of integrated elliptic flow from rhic to lhc was predicted in @xcite . furthermore , the emergence of the pqcd tail from the hydrodynamic spectrum at @xmath11  gev in central pb - pb collisions at the lhc was predicted in @xcite .",
    "high-@xmath7 partons are created in hard pqcd subprocesses along with bulk multiplicity production in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion ( a - a ) collisions .",
    "the idea that the final state interaction of such partons with the surrounding matter reflects properties of the bulk and that hence a measurement of high @xmath0 hadrons can be used as a probe of the qcd medium , is known as `` jet tomography '' @xcite .",
    "one of the expected signatures of this final state interaction is the suppression of high @xmath0 hadron production in a - a collisions as compared to the scaled expectation from proton - proton ( p - p ) collisions , measured by the nuclear suppression factor @xmath2 .",
    "this phenomenon is often called `` jet quenching '' ( although this is is slightly misleading since the observable is not a jet of hadrons but inclusive single - hadron spectrum ) .",
    "experimentally , jet quenching has been measured at rhic with great precision as a function of collision centrality and orientation with respect to the reaction plane @xcite .",
    "a number of parton - medium interaction models has been proposed and tested against the experimental results for @xmath2 together with a well - constrained hydrodynamical description of the bulk medium @xcite . however in systematical comparisons of models with the data , even including observables such as high @xmath0 back to back correlations , ambiguities remain @xcite which do not allow firm answers as to what the correct dynamics of parton - medium interaction is in nature .",
    "a partial answer was obtained with regard to models proposing elastic ( or more general incoherent ) energy loss of leading partons @xcite .",
    "such models fail to reproduce pathlength dependent observables such as the spread between in - plane and out of plane emission of hard hadrons @xcite .",
    "this result establishes that quantum coherence is a crucial ingredient of the dynamics , but fails to discriminate among the various qcd radiative energy loss models to the degree that a quantitative extraction of medium parameters would be possible with good accuracy @xcite .",
    "the underlying reason for this failure is that the nuclear suppression factor is largely independent of the functional form of the energy loss probability distribution @xmath12 for a given leading parton @xcite .",
    "while different models predict different forms for @xmath12 , the pqcd parton spectrum at rhic kinematics is so steeply falling that even a small shift in parton energy due to energy loss to the medium effectively acts like a complete suppression of the parton .",
    "thus , only a small part of @xmath12 close to zero energy loss is actually probed in observables .",
    "the vastly larger kinematic range of the lhc , leading to a significantly harder pqcd parton spectrum is expected to change this situation and to allow to probe more deeply into @xmath12 .",
    "while leading - parton energy loss models are sufficient to describe single inclusive high @xmath0 hadron production , there is a second class of models which treat the whole medium - modification of a parton shower in the medium @xcite with the aim of eventually describing fully reconstructed jets in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "these models are often monte - carlo ( mc ) codes extending vacuum shower codes such as pythia @xcite or herwig @xcite to include the interaction with a medium .",
    "a systematic comparison of these codes with pathlength dependent observables is so far largely absent .    in this paper",
    ", we make a simultaneous analysis of the high- and low-@xmath0 parts of the charged - hadron @xmath0 spectrum measured by the alice collaboration @xcite in @xmath1  tev central pb - pb collisions at the lhc .",
    "we first study the compatibility of the pqcd+saturation+hydrodynamics framework with the measured low-@xmath0 spectrum , systematically charting the model uncertainties .",
    "then for the high-@xmath0 part , using the obtained hydrodynamical evolution of the bulk matter as background , we investigate what discriminating power the first measurement of @xmath2 at the lhc @xcite offers for models which are tuned to describe the observed nuclear suppression at rhic .",
    "we consider both leading - parton radiation @xcite and elastic @xcite energy losses as well as showers @xcite modified by the qcd medium .",
    "for other recent works discussing @xmath2 at the lhc , see refs .",
    "@xcite .    for the @xmath2 study ,",
    "our strategy is as follows : first , in moving from rhic to lhc using our default hydrodynamical set - up , we compute @xmath2 for different models of parton - medium interaction without any re - tuning of parameters ( straight extrapolation ) . since some amount of uncertainty is expected to originate from the uncertainties in the hydrodynamical initial state , and due to the fact that energy - loss model parameters are known to differ for the same parton - medium interaction model even among constrained hydrodynamical models @xcite , we re - tune in a second run the model parameters to the best fit of the @xmath1  tev data and quote the difference to the tune at @xmath3  gev",
    "this allows to gauge how the change in @xmath9 acts to constrain models . using the best fits which we obtain for the low-@xmath0 and high-@xmath0 parts , we investigate to what extent the measured charged - hadron @xmath0 spectrum can be reproduced",
    "for obtaining the bulk hadron @xmath7 spectra in a hydrodynamical framework , we need to define the qcd matter initial conditions , solve the hydrodynamical equations numerically with a given equation of state ( eos ) , compute the thermal particle spectra at freeze - out , and account for the strong and electromagnetic decays of unstable particles .",
    "we compute the qcd matter initial densities using the ekrt saturation model @xcite , which is based on collinearly factorized pqcd minijet production and the conjecture of gluon saturation in the transverse plane . in this model , which has been quite successful in predicting the multiplicities from rhic to lhc , saturation of primary parton ( gluon ) production is assumed to take place when the minijet production vertices , each of which occupies a geometric uncertainty area @xmath13 , start to overlap . for central @xmath8-@xmath8 collisions studied here , the following criterion is fulfilled at saturation : @xmath14 where the number of produced minijets at @xmath15 in the mid - rapidity unit @xmath16 can be written in terms of the standard nuclear overlap function @xmath17 and leading - order ( lo ) pqcd cross sections as @xmath18 , with ( see ref .",

    "the inclusive cross section for producing partons of flavours @xmath26 and @xmath27 above is , as usual , @xmath28 for the nuclear parton distribution functions ( npdfs ) , we use the cteq6l1 pdfs @xcite together with the eps09 nuclear effects @xcite . for transverse energy ( @xmath29 ) production",
    ", the pqcd minijet calculation can be extended to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in an infra - red and collinear singularity safe manner ( whereas the number of produced minijets is not well defined beyond lo ) @xcite .",
    "the corresponding updated @xmath30 factors are , however , not yet available @xcite , which is why we simply perform a lo pqcd calculation here and fit the @xmath30 parameter in eq .",
    "( [ lominijets ] ) so that the minijet production at saturation leads to ( after hydrodynamic evolution and resonance decays ) the measured charged hadron multiplicity in the lhc pb - pb collisions at @xmath1  tev in the 0 - 5% centrality class , @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the obtained @xmath30 thus also accounts for all higher - order contributions .",
    "the centrality selection is simulated by considering a central @xmath32-@xmath32 collision of an effective nucleus @xmath33 , as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "most importantly , with the ekrt - based modeling above , we can also estimate the formation time of the system from the pqcd dynamics : according to the uncertainty principle , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the solution of eq .",
    "( [ saturation ] ) . with @xmath36 , obtained by an iterative fit to the measured multiplicity , we have @xmath37  gev and @xmath38  fm .    in the ekrt framework , where the computation of the minijet @xmath29 production is possible in nlo",
    ", the initial conditions should be given in terms of the energy density instead of the entropy density .",
    "once the saturation scale is known , we compute the local initial energy density by distributing the minijet @xmath29 over the transverse plane at the time @xmath39 according to ( for more details , see @xcite ) @xmath40 where @xmath41 above , we distribute the energy density into the transverse plane according to the binary collision profile , thus our default set - up is the `` ebc '' initialization",
    ". it should be emphasized , however , that since we do not attempt to make the saturation condition ( [ saturation ] ) strictly local in the transverse plane ( which would lead to a varying @xmath42 , see @xcite for such discussion ) , the transverse profile is not uniquely fixed here .",
    "we use ideal hydrodynamics to describe the space - time evolution of the bulk matter .",
    "since we will consider only mid - rapidity observables here , longitudinal boost invariance as well as neglecting the net - baryon number are very valid approximations .",
    "we solve the 2 + 1 dimensional relativistic hydrodynamical equations , @xmath43 , using the shasta algorithm @xcite .",
    "for the eos which closes the set of dynamical equations , we choose the recently developed eos s95p - v1 from ref .",
    "we assume a very rapid thermalization here , taking the formation time @xmath39 as the starting time @xmath44 for the hydrodynamical evolution .",
    "furthermore , a full chemical equilibrium and zero initial transverse flow are assumed .    regarding these initial conditions",
    ", we should emphasize three points here .",
    "first , the early initialization of the hydrodynamical evolution , @xmath45 , is quite essential , since , as pointed out long ago @xcite , pqcd minijets do produce a large amount of @xmath29 , and only by doing @xmath46 work over a long enough time early on , the hydrodynamically evolving system can sufficiently degrade its transverse energy : as shown in @xcite , the amount of the measured final - state @xmath29 is only a third of the initially produced @xmath29 .",
    "second , although the system may not be fully thermal at early times , the early start accounts for the buildup of flow and pressure as well as @xmath46 work during the thermalization stage .",
    "third , as discussed e.g. in @xcite , thermal photon production is very sensitive to the hydro initialization time . in order to explain the photon production measured at @xmath47 gev in @xmath3",
    "gev au - au collisions , one needs a substantial thermal photon production component from the qgp .",
    "this can be obtained only if the initialization time is small enough . for these reasons , we believe that to start the hydrodynamical evolution at an early time with zero transverse flow is physically a well motivated approximation .    finally , hadron spectra in the hydrodynamical model are calculated from a constant temperature freeze - out hypersurface using the cooper - frye formula @xcite , and accounting for the strong and electromagnetic decays of unstable particles .",
    "the freeze - out temperature @xmath48 is fixed so that we can describe the measured positive pion spectra in @xmath49 gev au - au collisions at rhic .",
    "the value of @xmath48 is found to be 165 mev for the ebc profile . as shown in @xcite , for computing the @xmath0 spectra of hadrons , keeping",
    "the @xmath48 unchanged from rhic to lhc is a good approximation to a more dynamical decoupling treatment where the scattering rates are compared with the expansion rate of the system .      figure  [ f - spectra ] shows the hydrodynamically obtained @xmath7 spectrum of charged hadrons in 0 - 5% central @xmath50  tev pb - pb collisions at the lhc , and its comparison with the alice data @xcite .",
    "also shown is the comparison with the computed pqcd - part of the spectrum , which is subjected to the energy losses of high - energy partons discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : elosses ] below .",
    "as seen in the figure , the agreement of the hydrodynamically obtained spectrum is quite good down to 4 - 5 gev , where the pqcd tail takes over .",
    "the observed behaviour , the change from the hydro - dominated to the pqcd - dominated spectrum at @xmath51 gev is indeed very similar to what was predicted in @xcite ( see fig .",
    "15 there ) .    to study the sensitivity of the hydrodynamic @xmath7 spectrum to the model uncertainties , we perform the following systematics shown in fig .  [ hydrosystematics ] .    first , in the upper left panel",
    ", we vary the freeze - out temperature between 120 mev and 165 mev , keeping the initial conditions fixed to the default set - up . with the single-@xmath48 scenario we use here ( i.e. no partial chemical equilibrium or coupling to a hadronic afterburner ) , a lower @xmath48 enables more transverse flow to develop which in turn leads to a flatter @xmath0 spectrum which easily overshoots the data both at rhic and at the lhc .",
    "thus , with the ebc and small-@xmath44 set - up we need a high value of @xmath48 .",
    "second , the upper right panel shows the sensitivity of the results to the initial time : here @xmath44 has been varied in the range @xmath52  @xmath53 , keeping the initial minijet @xmath29 and the final @xmath48 unchanged .",
    "we observe that the ebc set up favours a small hydro initialization time but that at the same time  since the initial @xmath29 is conserved and not the initial entropy ( @xmath54 )  the multiplicity decreases slightly with decreasing @xmath44 : @xmath55 .",
    "thus , changing @xmath44 by a factor 2 causes a change of 19 % in the multiplicity  a change which is already well beyond the 5 % error bar in the data @xcite .",
    "third , the panel on lower right shows the sensitivity of the hadronic @xmath0 spectrum to the choice of the energy density transverse profile .",
    "in addition to the binary profile @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ ebc ] ) , we have distributed the minijet @xmath29 also over a wounded nucleon density profile ( ewn ) , keeping however @xmath44 fixed . in this change ,",
    "the charged particle multiplicity then increases from 1580 to 1640 .",
    "based on fitting the measured charged - particle @xmath0 spectrum in @xmath57  gev au - au collisions at rhic , we use @xmath58  mev for the ewn case . due to the slower build - up of transverse flow in the ewn case ,",
    "the ewn spectrum becomes slightly steeper than our default ebc case with @xmath59 mev . from this",
    ", we can deduce that fine - tuning the transverse profile towards an ewn profile would be certainly possible but also that an early initial time @xmath60 is still required .",
    "fourth , the lower left panel shows the sensitivity of the spectrum to the fit parameter @xmath30 . for this figure",
    ", we allow a change of 20 % ( ca .",
    "300 ) in the multiplicity , and compute the @xmath29 and @xmath44 separately in each case but keep @xmath48 constant .",
    "we can see how an increase(decrease ) in the multiplicity corresponds to a larger increase(decrease ) in the value of @xmath30 but a smaller decrease(increase ) in @xmath44 .",
    "these scalings can be deduced from eqs .",
    "( 1)(5 ) , keeping track of the powers of @xmath61 and @xmath30 : at the scaling limit @xmath62 , and eq .",
    "( [ saturation ] ) gives @xmath63 .",
    "the energy density scales as @xmath64 , and the charged - particle multiplicity then scales as @xmath65 .",
    "thus , a 20% increase in the multiplicity corresponds to a 40 % increase in the value of @xmath30 and a 10 % decrease in @xmath44 .",
    "we see on the one hand , that our initial - state modeling is fairly robust against small variations in @xmath30 and on the other hand that fine - tuning of @xmath30 would depend on the transverse profile and also on @xmath48 .",
    "such fine - tuning , however , we do not consider very meaningful before more data , on e.g. identified hadron spectra , are available .    from fig .",
    "[ hydrosystematics ] , we conclude on the one hand that with our pqcd+saturation+(ideal)hydrodynamics framework we are committed to a fairly narrow window of the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath48 , and on the other hand that the profile uncertainty can be considered to be the main uncertainty from the jet quenching viewpoint",
    ". further fine - tuning of the hydrodynamical description is left as future work , when we are studying the centrality dependence of the hadronic @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "the starting point for a computation of the high @xmath0 hadron yield in an a - a collision is the initial spectrum of hard partons . in our framework , the differential cross section @xmath66 for the production of a parton @xmath67 in an a - a collision is calculated in lo pqcd by integrating out the unobserved parton kinematics in eq .",
    "( [ lominijets ] ) ( explicit expressions are given in @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "uncertainty relation arguments indicate that the medium can not modify the hard process itself , but rather influences the fragmentation pattern of the outgoing highly virtual partons , in particular their development into a parton shower .",
    "thus , for in - medium shower models , the expression to evaluate is the convolution of the partonic production cross section with the medium - modified fragmentation function ( mmff ) , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the mmff , averaged over the geometry of the medium , @xmath70 is the fractional momentum of produced hadrons given a parton @xmath67 , and @xmath71 is the hadronic momentum scale . to evaluate",
    "this expression requires knowledge of both the geometry of the medium ( e.g. in terms of a spacetime description of medium density ) and of the mmff @xmath72 for any given path @xmath73 through the medium .",
    "if the angle between outgoing parton and the reaction plane is @xmath74 , the path of a given parton through the medium @xmath75 , i.e. its trajectory @xmath73 as a function of proper medium evolution time @xmath76 is determined in an eikonal approximation by its initial position @xmath77 and the angle @xmath74 as @xmath78 where the parton is assumed to move with the speed of light @xmath79 and the @xmath80-direction is chosen to be in the reaction plane .",
    "how @xmath72 is obtained once a medium is specified is characteristic for a given model of parton - medium interaction and will be discussed for the code yajem later .",
    "once the mmff for a given path is known , the averaging over the medium geometry is given by @xmath81 here , the initial distribution of hard vertices in the transverse @xmath82 plane is assumed to be calculable as @xmath83    in the leading - parton energy loss approximation , the medium - modified production of high-@xmath0 hadrons can be computed from the convolution @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the medium - induced energy loss probability , averaged over the medium geometry and @xmath86 is the vacuum fragmentation function for the production of a hadron @xmath87 from a parton @xmath67 , at fractional momentum @xmath70 and hadronic momentum scale @xmath71 .",
    "the underlying assumption is that the dynamics of parton - medium interactions can largely be cast in terms of a shift in leading parton energy and that hence the mmff can be approximated by the convolution of an energy loss probability with the vacuum fragmentation function , @xmath88 . in this case",
    ", the energy - loss probability for a given path @xmath73 of a parton through the medium , @xmath89 , is the ingredient to be computed within a specific model of parton - medium interaction .",
    "if @xmath89 is known , the geometrical averaging involves as above integrating over all possible initial vertices @xmath90 with the weight of @xmath91 and over all possible orientations @xmath74 as @xmath92    in all cases , the nuclear modification factor is computed with the given medium - modified yield of hard hadron production as @xmath93    the details of the parton - medium interaction model are thus in either the energy loss probability distribution @xmath94 for leading parton energy loss models or the mmff @xmath72 for in - medium shower models , given a specific path through the medium . in the following , we formulate three different types of models which we apply to the alice data .",
    "the detailed calculation of @xmath89 follows the baier - dokshitzer - mueller - peigne - schiff ( bdmps ) formalism for radiative energy loss @xcite using quenching weights as introduced by salgado and wiedemann @xcite .    in this framework , the energy loss probability @xmath94 for a path can be obtained by evaluating the line integrals along @xmath75 as @xmath95 with the relation @xmath96 assumed between the local transport coefficient @xmath97 ( specifying the quenching power of the medium ) , the energy density @xmath98 and the local flow rapidity @xmath99 with angle @xmath100 between flow and parton trajectory @xcite .",

    "it simulates the evolution from a highly virtual initial parton to a shower of partons at lower virtuality in the presence of a medium .",
    "a detailed description of the model can be found in @xcite .",
    "the parton shower developing from a highly virtual initial hard parton in this model is described as a series of @xmath109 splittings @xmath110 where the virtuality scale decreases in each splitting , i.e. @xmath111 and the energy is shared among the daughter partons @xmath112 as @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the splitting probabilities for a parton @xmath115 in terms of @xmath116 are calculable in pqcd and the resulting shower is computed event by event in a mc framework . in the presence of a medium ,",
    "the main assumption of yajem is that the parton kinematics or the splitting probability is modified . in the rad ( radiative energy loss )",
    "scenario , the relevant modification is a virtuality gain @xmath117 through the interaction with the medium during the parton lifetime @xmath118 .",
    "this modification leads to an increase in radiation . in order to evaluate eq .",
    "( [ e - qgain ] ) during the shower evolution , the momentum space variables of the shower evolution equations need to be linked with a spacetime position in the medium .",

    "@xcite , the formation length of the in - medium shower is forced to be within the medium length .",
    "this corresponds to the choice @xmath124 which depends on both in - medium pathlength @xmath125 and shower - initiating parton energy @xmath126 .",
    "the original motivation for this prescription was to introduce a pathlength dependence that can account for the experimentally observed split between in - plane and out of plane emission of high @xmath0 hadrons in non - central collisions @xcite .",
    "however , together with the stronger pathlength dependence , yajem - d also predicts a strong rise of @xmath2 with @xmath0 in angular averaged observables which we aim to test against the alice data .    in principle , the full functional form of @xmath97 could determine the mmff , which would be computationally very expensive as a full mc simulation would be needed for every possible path in the medium .",
    "however , due to an approximate scaling law identified in @xcite , it is sufficient to compute the line integral @xmath127 in the medium to obtain the full mmff @xmath72 from a yajem simulation for a given eikonal path of the shower - initiating parton , where @xmath128 is the momentum scale of the shower initializing parton .",
    "the scaling law implies that the mc simulation has to be run only for a finite set of paths and makes a numerical solution of the geometry averaging possible .",
    "each yajem run determines the mmff for a fixed partonic scale @xmath129 . to account for the scale evolution of the mmff ,",
    "runs for different @xmath129 need to be done . for technical reasons having to do with numerical performance , we like to evolve the mmff for given hadronic scale as indicated in eq .",
    "( [ e - conv ] ) . for matching a partonic scale for which the mmff is computed to a hadronic scale , we use the following procedure : for each available partonic scale , @xmath130 is computed , and the exponent @xmath131 of a power law fit to the parton spectrum at scale @xmath129 is determined .",
    "the maximum of @xmath132 corresponds to the most likely value @xmath133 in the fragmentation process , and thus the partonic scale choice is best for a corresponding hadronic scale @xmath134 .",
    "the @xmath0 dependence of the hadronic @xmath2 is then computed by interpolation between runs with different scale choice for the mmff .    as in the previous case , @xmath101 in eq.([e - qhat ] ) serves as the adjustable parameter of the model once @xmath122 is chosen .",
    "yajem requires , dependent on the underlying hydrodynamical model , rather natural values for @xmath101 ranging from 0.6 to 2 .      in @xcite , a phenomenological model for elastic energy loss , consisting of a discrete parton escape probability and a gaussian parametrization for the energy loss probability",
    "was introduced to explore the pathlength dependence of incoherent energy loss . while the model itself is rather simplistic ,",
    "its main findings with regard to pathlength dependence have been confirmed later in a detailed mc simulation of elastic energy loss @xcite .",
    "it needs to be stressed that unlike the previous models , the parametrized elastic energy loss is not meant as a serious qcd based model for the underlying dynamics of parton - medium interaction .",
    "the reason that it is presented here is rather that the simple and adjustable form of @xmath94 allows insight into how the observed rise of @xmath2 with @xmath0 depends on the underlying functional form of the energy loss probability density , which is much less transparent in the context of asw or yajem .    in the model ,",
    "the escape probability of a parton @xmath135 without any medium interaction is computed as @xmath136 = \\exp[- \\gamma_i \\cdot \\kappa]\\ ] ] where it is assumed that @xmath137 is approximately independent of @xmath73 , and @xmath138 is defined as @xmath139 taking into account the flow corrections to the probed density . here",
    "@xmath140 is a parameter with dimensions of a cross section measuring the interaction strength , and hence @xmath141 must hold to account for the different color factors of quarks and gluons .    if the parton does not escape without energy loss , it must undergo a shift in energy ( there is also the possibility that a strong shift into a thermal regime occurs , which is equivalent to an absorption of the parton ) .",
    "it is assumed that the mean value of the shift in energy will grow linearly in the number of scatterings @xmath142 as @xmath143 with @xmath144 the mean energy loss per scattering , whereas the fluctuations around the mean will grow like @xmath145 . assuming a gaussian distribution , this leads to the ansatz @xmath146\\ ] ] where @xmath147 is a normalization such that @xmath148 and ( [ e - elastic ] ) has to hold for quarks and gluons separately due to the different color factor .",
    "@xmath149 is a parameter with the dimensions of a cross section times the energy shift per reaction .",
    "the model is thus characterized by three parameters :    * @xmath149 controls the mean shift in energy per expected scattering * @xmath150 governs the strength of fluctuations around this mean shift . if @xmath150 is small , the model will have a strong correlation between path ( and hence initial vertex ) and shift in energy , if the parameter is large , this correlation is lessened * @xmath140 finally determines the magnitude of the escape probability .    in @xcite",
    "it was discussed that the space of all possible @xmath151 which can describe the measured @xmath2 for @xmath3  gev central au - au collisions is triangular and ordered by @xmath152  if @xmath153 is of the order of the measured @xmath2 already , the space of allowed shifts in energy is very constrained . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath153 is small , more possibilities for a shift arise .",
    "here , we investigate two distinct scenarios , one with large escape probabilities for quarks and gluons close to the allowed limit where @xmath154 and one with about half these values where @xmath155 .",
    "the parameters are found in table [ t - params ] .",
    "note that the parameters here do not correspond to the sets given in @xcite since we use a different hydrodynamical model to do the extrapolation from @xmath3  gev to 2.76  tev here .",
    ".[t - params]parameters for the two different elastic energy loss scenarios described in the text . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in fig .  [",
    "f - spectra ] , we show in addition to the good description of low @xmath0 bulk matter by hydrodynamics the quality of the description of the high @xmath0 part above 6 gev by pqcd + jet quenching .",
    "we conclude from this comparison that a lo pqcd calculation , supplemented by a @xmath30 factor , is sufficient for the accuracy required to compute @xmath2 reliably enough .",
    "the residual small deviations are not a crucial issue , since due to the nature of @xmath2 as a ratio of @xmath0 spectra deviations in the spectral shape between computation and data cancel to first order and only lead to subleading corrections .",
    "we also note at this point that the effect of jet quenching can not be cast into the form of a constant downward shift of the unmodified spectrum , but that rather its @xmath0 dependence is crucial to describe the spectral shape correctly . as an interesting side remark",
    ", the fact that pqcd and jet quenching offer a good description of the spectrum from 6 to 20 gev suggests that there is fairly little room for another @xmath0-dependent component of hadron production , such as suggested by , e.g. certain recombination models ( see e.g. @xcite ) in this region . on the other hand , e.g. the sudden recombination model @xcite expects to see effects largely at lower momenta .",
    "however , since recombination models generically expect quite different effects for mesons and baryons @xcite , the charged hadron spectrum is not a suitable observable to gauge the importance of recombination in this momentum window and a detailed discussion should be based on identified hadron spectra .      in fig .",
    "[ f - raa ] we show @xmath2 computed in the various models for parton - medium interaction discussed above in comparison with the alice data @xcite , with their parameters adjusted to 0 - 10% central @xmath3  gev au - au collisions at rhic .",
    "the assumption underlying this extrapolation is that the hydrodynamical model for the bulk matter can be extended from rhic to lhc in a well controlled manner .",
    "this is a non - trivial issue , as it is known that changing the hydrodynamical model at the same energy may amount to 50% change in model parameters if the underlying dynamics is sufficiently different , even if both models are constrained by bulk observables .    the predictions for @xmath2 from the various models at @xmath1  tev turn out to be quite dramatically different in normalization , shape and their expectation for even larger @xmath0 . in particular , the differences between models are significantly larger than the statistical errors of the measurement , thus allowing for a clean discrimination if the systematic errors ( such as those with the p - p baseline ) can be understood .",
    "asw and yajem in the default mode predict a rather slow rise of @xmath2 with @xmath0 along with a strong suppression .",
    "this is not in agreement with the data shown for the default p - p reference , but would agree better with an alternative nlo scaled p - p reference ( see @xcite for details ) .    both parametrized elastic scenarios reproduce the shape of @xmath2 with the default reference well , they mainly differ in the normalization .",
    "the difference between the parametrized elastic and the asw model can be understood as follows : at rhic conditions , only a narrow region of @xmath12 around zero is effectively probed due to the steeply falling spectrum , as even a small shift in parton energy is equivalent to a massive suppression . in the parametrized elastic models , most of the weight of @xmath85",
    "is contained in the region between zero and @xmath156 gev ( see e.g. fig .  1 right in @xcite ) , for small @xmath153 even more weight is contained close to the origin .",
    "this is very different for @xmath85 computed in the asw model  here ( see e.g. fig .  5 in @xcite ) the distribution is much flatter and contains a sizeable weight out to 100 gev .    to illustrate this in more detail : in a schematic model neglecting ( among other things ) hadronization",
    ", @xmath2 can be understood from the ratio of modified over unmodified parton spectrum , where the modified parton spectrum at a given @xmath7 is determined by the number of partons escaping without energy loss plus the number of partons available in the spectrum at @xmath157 times the probability @xmath12 of a shift by @xmath158 . if we assume a power law @xmath159 for the parton spectrum , @xmath160 it is evident from the expression that @xmath2 at a given @xmath7 is equal to the transmission term of zero energy loss plus a contribution which is proportional to the integral of @xmath107 from zero up to the energy scale @xmath161 of the parton ( since a parton can not lose more energy than it originally has ) , _ seen through the filter _ of the steeply falling spectrum .",
    "@xmath2 then generically grows with @xmath7 since @xmath161 grows linearly with @xmath7 , and the speed of growth depends on the weight of @xmath107 in the region from zero to @xmath161 and on the power @xmath131 of the parton spectrum .    at the lhc ,",
    "more of @xmath107 is accessible compared with rhic due to the harder underlying parton spectrum , i.e. the power @xmath131 of the filter by which large @xmath158 in @xmath107 are suppressed is reduced .",
    "this translates into a stronger rise of @xmath2 with @xmath0 @xcite as compared to rhic kinematics , and this rise is most pronounced for models where there is substantial weight of the energy loss probability density close to the origin .",
    "thus , the parametrized elastic model with small @xmath153 shows the strongest rise , while asw shows very weak @xmath0 dependence .    finally , yajem - d predicts the strongest rise of @xmath2 with @xmath0 as a consequence of eq .",
    "( [ e - q0 ] ) .",
    "in addition to the rise expected from the way the effective energy loss probability is probed as outlined above , yajem - d thus contains an explicit mechanism which introduces a strong energy dependence into the mmff itself . while the normalization of the curve falls below the default baseline data , the shape is well reproduced .      as discussed in the context of fig .",
    "[ hydrosystematics ] above , there can be residual uncertainties in extrapolating the qcd matter fluid dynamics description from rhic to the lhc .",
    "therefore , in the second step , we allow a refit of parton - medium interaction model parameters to the alice data .",
    "we introduce a parameter @xmath162 to quantify the amount of refitting which is needed , where @xmath162 stands for the ratio of modified over unmodified parameter @xmath101 . here",
    "we would consider , say , a 25% change in the model parameter reasonable within the uncertainties of the hydrodynamical extrapolation .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ f - raarefit ] .    following this procedure , we find that the asw model can be brought into a rough agreement with the alternative p - p reference data , but even allowing for a substantial parameter readjustment it does not agree with the default reference data  the @xmath0 dependence is too weak .",
    "yajem likewise follows the trend of the alternative p - p reference data well .",
    "yajem - d on the other hand can be brought into good agreement in both shape and normalization with the default p - p reference data .",
    "unfortunately , even provided that we are willing to discard a model based on deviations @xmath163 or @xmath164 in the refitting procedure , we can at present make no such statement from the alice data due to the uncertainty in the p - p baseline .",
    "this stresses the importance of having a measured baseline .",
    "however , looking at fig .",
    "[ f - raa ] , we see reason to conclude that already a larger range in @xmath0 will allow to decisively rule out some models based on the wrong shape of the @xmath0 dependence .",
    "in this work , we have simultaneously analyzed the low-@xmath0 and high-@xmath0 spectrum of charged hadrons in central pb - pb collisions at @xmath1  tev . for hydrodynamical modeling describing the low-@xmath0 spectrum ,",
    "we have computed the initial conditions based on pqcd minijet production and saturation @xcite . to account for the nlo and higher order corrections in minijet production",
    ", we have made an iterative fit to the measured lhc charged - hadron multiplicity .",
    "the main outcome of this computation are the produced transverse energy and the early formation time , @xmath165  fm , of the pqcd minijet system .",
    "we assume that @xmath39 is also the starting time @xmath44 for the hydrodynamical evolution but in charting the uncertainties of our modeling , we have shown the sensitivity of the computed @xmath0 spectrum to @xmath44 .",
    "also the sensitivity to the decoupling temperature , multiplicity fitting , and transverse profile of the initial energy density is explicitly shown .    in our hydrodynamic framework , the uncertainty related to the initial transverse profile can be considered to be the main uncertainty in the extrapolation from rhic to lhc .",
    "we have for simplicity considered two possibilities here , the ebc and the ewn profiles , thus essentially ignoring the qcd dynamics that may cause the profile to change from rhic to lhc . the profile should , however , be computable in the pqcd+saturation approach @xcite but since we do not have the needed nlo pqcd elements fully at hand yet @xcite , we leave this as interesting future work .",
    "we nevertheless can see that within the uncertainties charted , the pqcd + saturation + ( ideal)hydrodynamics framework works quite well in reproducing the charged - hadron @xmath0 spectrum up to @xmath166  gev , and that we obtain the agreement essentially without further tuning of the hydrodynamic parameters from rhic to lhc . also interestingly ,",
    "we have observed ( see fig .",
    "[ f - spectra ] ) that once parton energy losses have been accounted for , the computed pqcd tail of high-@xmath0 hadron production starts to dominate over the hydrodynamic component at @xmath6  gev .",
    "comparison with the lhc data shows that the matching of these two components is very efficient in that it leaves fairly little room for hadron production components in addition to the hydrodynamics and pqcd+energy loss in the cross - over region @xmath167  gev .    after getting the obtained hydrodynamical evolution of the background qcd matter in control ,",
    "we have proceeded to analyze the high-@xmath0 part of the charged - hadron @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "we have applied several models of parton - medium interactions , tuned to the nuclear suppression factor @xmath2 at @xmath3  gev au - au collisions , to @xmath1  tev pb - pb collisions where the primary parton spectra are significantly harder .",
    "we found that in principle the large kinematic lever - arm at the lhc translates into a significant power to distinguish various models , even given the uncertainties in extrapolating the bulk medium model to larger energy .",
    "of particular importance here is the rise of @xmath2 with @xmath0 observed at @xmath1  tev which is intimately connected with the slope of the pqcd parton spectrum and reflects the way the energy loss probability distribution is probed .    if one had no systematic uncertainty in the data at this point , two of the models we tested ( asw and yajem )",
    "could be ruled out already by the alice data obtained with the default p - p baseline . on the other hand ,",
    "these models agree fairly well with the alternative p - p reference data .",
    "however , in addition to the angular averaged suppression factor in central collisions considered here , other observables need to be studied .",
    "if we require that a model should also account for the observed spread between the in - plane and out - of - plane hard hadron emission as observed at @xmath3  gev , then yajem would be strongly disfavoured @xcite and yajem - d would be more consistent with the data than asw .",
    "the fact that the simple parametrized elastic energy loss model which is known to fail for pathlength dependent observables is able to describe the scaling in @xmath168 from rhic to lhc rather well should be a stern warning that @xmath168 and @xmath0 dependence only probe particular aspects of energy loss models , and that agreement with a subset of available observables may not be enough to judge the validity of a model .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ f - raa ] , extending the measurements of @xmath2 out to larger values of @xmath0 at the lhc will provide strong constraints and viability tests for the parton - medium interaction models . a combined analysis of @xmath2 in the dependence on @xmath169 , impact parameter @xmath170 and reaction plane angle @xmath74 will be highly discriminating between the available models even without having to resort to other high @xmath0 observables such as triggered correlation measurements or fully reconstructed jets . constraining the nature of the parton - medium interaction by leading hadron production in this way is thus the first step towards tackling the more difficult task of understanding the complete dynamics of a parton shower in the medium .",
