    "the present gsi accelerator facility allows for beam energies in the case of heavy ions of up to 2 @xmath0gev ( for @xmath1 ) and for protons up to 4.7 gev .",
    "both heavy ion and proton beams can be used to produce a secondary @xmath2 beam which is available with beam momenta from 0.6 to 2.8 gev / c . in this energy regime the different probes are used to study nuclear matter at high temperatures / high density as well as normal nuclear matter .",
    "[ f1 ] shows the behaviour of the so - called quark condensate @xmath3 as a function of temperature and density scaled by normal nuclear matter density ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the condensate can be read as a measure for the restoration of chiral symmetry ; in case of a vanishing condensate chiral symmetry should be restored , while it is broken in the `` real world '' .",
    "also a partial restoration of chiral symmetry should have effects to the properties of particles embedded in the appropriate environment .",
    "the areas indicated in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] should illustrate the range of @xmath3 for heavy ion reactions and elementary probes such as proton and pion beams .",
    "a sizeable reduction of @xmath3 is visable .",
    "hence , there might be non - trivial in - medium effects like mass shift , resonance broadening , change in production cross sections and/or the formation of bound states .    [ cols= \"",

    "as mentioned above , the fopi apparatus will be supplemented by an additional @xmath6 trigger which is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ silvioschem ] .",
    "the working principle of the @xmath6 trigger is based on the on - line comparison of charged particle multiplicities .",
    "therefore , two layers of silicon strip detectors are mounted perpendicular to the beam axis at a distance of 3 cm and 13 cm from the target , respectively .",
    "if a @xmath6 hyperon , e.g. from reaction ( [ eq6 ] ) , decays in between the two layers and its charged decay products are detected in the second layer , the multiplicity jump of + 2 can be used for a trigger decision .",
    "+ the appropriate detectors , an annular one , single - sided , divided in 32 sectors , and a patchwork of eight rectangular double - sided ( 6 @xmath104 cm , with 16 long strips on one side and 60 short strips on the other side ) silicon strip detectors of 1 mm thickness are assembled and equipped with frontend and readout electronics .",
    "special modules are used to provide a fast multiplicity signal . + a setup of two silicon strip detectors ( square area ) has been tested in - beam .",
    "the trigger concept showed to work with a very good trigger purity [ ] .",
    "+ the final experiment , scheduled for the year 2009 , will use the fopi detector together with the @xmath6 trigger ( like shown in fig .",
    "[ silvioschem ] ) .",
    "the target will be a cell filled with liquid hydrogen .",
    "in addition , a new start detector capable to deliver a fast timing signal for the minimal ionizing proton beam particles as well as a beam profile monitor and a veto detector to ensure that the target is hit in its center are constructed . in september 2008",
    "a final in - beam test of all components will take place .",
    "besides the two experiments with @xmath7 and proton beams discussed in the previous sections , fopi pursues an experimental program with heavy - ion collisions .",
    "+ correlations of @xmath6p pairs , like from reaction ( [ eq6 ] ) , are investigated in heavy ion reactions , too .",
    "[ hic ] shows the @xmath6p invariant mass distributions of the two systems ni+ni and al+al .",
    "an excess at a mass of @xmath112.14 gev / c@xmath12 is observed with an statistical signifcance of @xmath115 .",
    "the interpretation of this observation is , however , not straight forward , as it might come from a bound state , final state interaction or be a partial invariant mass of a heavier state like @xmath13he .",
    "the search for strange clusters is continued ( correlations of @xmath6 with protons , deuterons and tritons ) as well as the search for other multibaryonic states ( h@xmath14 ) .",
    "+ furthermore , the production of @xmath6 , k@xmath15 and @xmath16 mesons as well as resonances like @xmath17(1385 ) and k@xmath18(892 ) is studied ( see e.g. [ ] ) .",
