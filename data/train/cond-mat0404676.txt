    "more and more precise measurements are needed in science ( e.g. in astrophysics ) and therefore very sensitive detectors are required . however , even if all the technological difficulties are removed and the detector components would be perfect , the thermal fluctuations and the discreteness of particle and energy fluxes through the detector would still limit the precision of the measurements . to achieve the desired sensitivity",
    ", the detectors have to work at sub - kelvin temperatures ( to minimize the fluctuations ) and have linear dimensions in the micrometer scale or even smaller ( for small heat capacity and for the possibility to assamble high resolution detector arrays for space applications ) . for such ranges of temperatures and dimensions ,",
    "finite - size effects come into play .",
    "good thermal insulation of the detector is essential to attain the working temperature . for this purpose , placing the detector on top of a free - standing , amorphous and dielectric silicon - nitride ( sin@xmath5 ) membrane appears to be a very convenient design ( see for example refs .",
    "the thickness of such a membrane is of the order of hundreds of nm , which is very small as compared to its other dimensions .",
    "the membrane may also be cut , so that the detector lies on its central and wider part , which is connected to the bulk material by narrow bridges ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_membrane ] ) .",
    "( 80,26 ) ( 0,0 )    thermal characteristics of sin@xmath5 membranes and bridges have been investigated experimentally by several authors ( as examples , see @xcite ) .",
    "sin@xmath5 is an amorphous dielectric and , if we neglect here the dynamic defects ( see review @xcite and references therein ) , its low temperature thermal properties are determined only by phonons . at temperatures below a few degrees kelvin , the bulk material ( assumed to be isotropic ) is well described by the debye model , with typical values for the longitudinal and transversal sound velocities @xmath6 m / s and @xmath7 m / s , respectively @xcite .",
    "hence , the heat capacity can be expressed as @xmath8 , where @xmath1 is the temperature and @xmath9 is a constant .",
    "if the mean free path of the phonons , @xmath10 , is assumed to vary as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the phonon wavelength , the heat conductivity has the expression @xmath13 , where again @xmath14 is a material dependent constant ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    note that for the above given values of sound velocity , and at temperatures below 1 k , the bulk dominant phonon wavelength , @xmath15 ( see @xcite , chap .",
    "8) , is of several hundreds of nanometers .",
    "thus it is comparable with the smallest dimensions of the structures measured in refs .",
    "typically in these experiments , the measurements made at the lower end of the temperature interval showed qualitative differences from the measurements at the upper end of the interval , due to finite - size effects .    in this paper we will improve the model of refs .",
    "@xcite by calculating rigorously the phonon modes and their dispersion relations in ultrathin membranes and narrow bridges",
    ". we shall show the thermodynamical consequences of the calculations .",
    "such calculations appear to be well known to those working in the field of elasticity theory ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) , but apparently are not so familiar to the condensed matter community . therefore , to make the paper more readable , we shall give some details of our calculations . to describe these effects ,",
    "a simplified model was recently used @xcite .",
    "namely , it was assumed that the phonon modes are quantized along the direction perpendicular to the membrane surface . in this way ,",
    "the three - dimensional ( 3d ) ( quasi)continuous phonon spectrum splits into what one could call two - dimensional ( 2d ) branches @xcite . at low enough temperatures ,",
    "only the lowest branches are populated by phonons and the membrane is described as a 2d isotropic phonon gas .",
    "in this situation , if the mean free path of the phonons varies as @xmath16 , the heat capacity has the form @xmath17 and the thermal conductivity is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are material dependent constants .",
    "this model describes the change of the exponent of the temperature dependence of heat conductivity , as observed in refs .",
    "@xcite , and could fit relatively well the experimental data @xcite . on the other hand , the observation that in narrow bridges the exponent of the temperature dependence of the heat conductivity apparently converges to 1.5 as the width of the bridge decreases @xcite , as well as the increase of the ratio @xmath21 with temperature @xcite , can not be explained in this model .",
    "in refs .  @xcite it was considered simply that the longitudinal and transversal polarized phonon modes are independently quantized by neumann boundary conditions imposed at the membrane surfaces .",
    "nevertheless , in a rigorous analysis it must be taken into account that the modes with different polarization couple at a free surface@xcite and because of this , the phonon modes in thin membranes are `` distorted '' and show features that go beyond a simple treatment of the _ quasi _ 2d phonon gas .    for concreteness , we perform calculations for the practically important case of sin@xmath5 membranes with thickness @xmath22 nm having parallel surfaces",
    ". other dimensions of the membranes are usually of the order of 100 @xmath23 .",
    "consequently , the membranes can be considered as infinitely long and wide .",
    "it is further assumed that the material is isotropic .",
    "the eigenmodes of these kind of systems are well known from acoustics and are called lamb waves @xcite .",
    "similar to electricity theory , the physical acoustic fields can be expressed by a scalar and a vector potential , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the velocity fields of the longitudinal @xmath26 and transversal @xmath27 phonon modes are then defined as @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "simple wave equations can be derived for the potentials , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "here @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the longitudinal and transversal sound velocities , respectively . in an infinite three - dimensional space",
    "this yields one longitudinal and two transversal plane wave solutions .",
    "( 80,27)(0,0 ) ( 0,0 )    when however the system is restricted to finite size , the boundaries of the system lead to a coupling of longitudinal and transversal modes .",
    "this coupling is due to the boundary condition at a free surface : the total stress should vanish . if the wave incident on the surface is polarized along the @xmath34 direction ( see fig .",
    "[ reflections ] a ) , the free boundary condition is satisfied if the reflected wave has the same polarization .",
    "such a wave is called a horizontal shear wave ( @xmath35-wave ) .",
    "the @xmath35-waves do not mix at the boundaries with waves of different polarizations and they form the typical `` box eigenmodes '' , with the dispersion relation @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the component of the wave vector parallel to the membrane surface and @xmath38 is the thickness of the membrane . on the other hand ,",
    "if the polarization of the incident wave is either longitudinal or transversal , but in the plane @xmath39 , then the reflected wave will always be a superposition of longitudinally and transversally polarized waves .",
    "these two waves have different propagation velocities , and the condition to get eigenmodes is that the plane waves reconstruct each other after two reflections .",
    "the longitudinal and transversal components of the eigenmode have the same wave vector component @xmath37 along the membrane surfaces , but different components perpendicular to the surfaces , which we shall call @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "the frequency of the eigenmode is then @xmath42 .",
    "these equations give a relation between the components @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the eigenmodes obtained in this way fall into two classes : symmetric ( s - wave ) and antisymmetric ( a - wave ) , according to the symmetry of the velocity field of the wave with respect to the plane @xmath43 .",

    "all the modes would be of this type and the results would be identical to the ones of refs .",
    "however , due to the coupling of the longitudinal and transversal modes , the dispersion relations of the @xmath45- and @xmath44-modes show some interesting properties .    at @xmath48 ,",
    "all the excited branches satisfy the relation @xmath49 , but for the @xmath44- and @xmath45-modes , unlike for the @xmath35-modes , @xmath50 may be either positive or negative . if @xmath51 , the dispersion curve has a minimum at some value @xmath52 .",
