    "in several applications of linear accelerators the charged particle beam passes through the accelerating structures more than once after being lead back to the entrance of the linac by a return loop . by this method",
    "the linac can either add energy to electrons several times , or it can recapture the energy of high energy electrons after they have already been used for experiments .",
    "the former technique is referred to as recirculating linac , the latter as energy recovery linac ( erl ) @xcite .",
    "erls have received attention in recent years since they have the potential to accelerator currents much larger than those of non - recovering linacs , and since they have the potential for providing emittances smaller than those in x - ray storage rings at similar energies and for similar beam currents .",
    "this is due to the fact that the emittances in an erl can be as small as that of the electron source , if emittance increase during acceleration can be avoided .",
    "several laboratories have proposed high power erls for different purposes .",
    "designs for light production with different parameter sets and various applications are being worked on by cornell university @xcite , daresbury @xcite , tjnaf @xcite , jaeri @xcite , novosibirsk @xcite , and kek @xcite .",
    "tjnaf has incorporated an erl in its design of an electron ",
    "ion collider ( eic ) @xcite for medium energy physics , while bnl is working on an erl  based electron cooler @xcite for the ions in the relativistic ion collider ( rhic ) .",
    "the work at tjnaf , jaeri and novosibirsk is based on existing erls of relatively small scale .",
    "the first international erl workshop with over 150 participants in early 2005 has also shown the large interest in erls that is prevalent in the accelerator community",
    ".    one important limitation to the current that can be accelerated in erls or recirculating linear accelerators in general is the regenerative beam - breakup ( bbu ) instability .",
    "the size and cost of all these new accelerators certainly requires a very detailed understanding of this limitation . in @xcite",
    "we have described this theory for particle motion in one degree of freedom . here",
    "we generalize this theory to two degrees of freedom , i.e. to accelerators with polarized homs and @xmath0-@xmath1 coupling of the particle optics .    for one degree of freedom , a theory of bbu instability in recirculating linacs , where the energy is not recovered but added in each pass through the linac ,",
    "was presented in @xcite .",
    "this original theory was additionally restricted to scenarios where the bunches of the different turns are in the linac at about the same accelerating rf phase , such as in the so - called continuous wave ( cw ) operation where every bucket is filled . tracking simulations @xcite compared well with this theory .",
    "this theory determines above what threshold current @xmath2 the transverse bunch position @xmath0 displays undamped oscillations in the presence of a higher order mode ( hom ) with frequency @xmath3 .",
    "if there is only one higher order mode and one recirculation turn with a recirculation time @xmath4 in the linac , the following formula is obtained for @xmath5 : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the speed of light , @xmath8 is the elementary charge , @xmath9 is the impedance ( in units of @xmath10 ) of the higher order mode driving the instability , @xmath11 is its quality factor . in the case of one degree of freedom , @xmath12 is the element of the transport matrix that relates initial transverse momentum @xmath13 before and @xmath0 after the recirculation loop .",
    "a corresponding formula had already been presented in @xcite . occasionally , additional factors are found when this equation is stated @xcite .",
    "but in @xcite it has been shown that no such additional factors are required .",
    "the beam transport element @xmath14 appears since a hom produces a transverse momentum @xmath13 during the first pass of a particle .",
    "this produces a transverse position of @xmath15 when the particle traverses the hom for a second time , and this in turn excites the hom itself by means of the wake field @xmath16 .",
    "when the mode is polarized with an angle @xmath17 , the kick produced during the first turn corresponds to the momentum @xmath18 . with a coupled optics , the resulting orbit displacement when the particle reaches the hom after the return loop is @xmath19 .",
    "this excites the higher order mode by the projection of this displacement onto the wake field , @xmath20 .",
    "the hom therefore produces a transverse kick that feeds back to itself , exactly as in the case with one degree of freedom , only that @xmath14 needs to be replaced @xcite by @xmath21    while equation [ eq : simpbbu ] is derived with one hom , for one degree of freedom it is often a good approximation even when the cavity has several higher order modes .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that different homs can be treated individually when their frequencies differ by more than about @xmath22 .",
    "this statement does not hold for two degrees of freedom as will be shown in this paper .",
    "modes can not in general be treated independently , even when their frequencies are separated by much more than the width of the hom s resonance .",
    "an optics configuration that makes @xmath23 close to zero in order to make the threshold current very large has been proposed @xcite and tested for coupled beam transport and polarized homs .",
    "this is a good technique when there is one dominant hom .",
    "when there are several modes this approach does not apply directly , even if these modes are separated by more than the width of their resonance .",
    "the paper is arranged as following : first , a dispersion relation for the current @xmath24 is derived including coupling in a one turn recirculating linac with one cavity having multiple polarized homs .",
    "the smallest real value of @xmath25 that can be obtained with real @xmath26 determines the threshold current .",
    "analytical solutions are given for the case of two polarized homs in one cavity .",
    "it is explained how the dispersion relation for this simple case can be solved efficiently on a computer , and comparisons to analytical approximations are presented .",
    "approximations are then given for @xmath27 polarized modes in one cavity .",
    "subsequently a dispersion relation for multiple cavities and multiple recirculation loops is derived that can only be solved numerically with similarly efficient techniques .",
    "finally , misalignments of cavities are considered to investigate when these misalignments lead to a very large static displacement of the beam orbit .",
    "for simplicity we are here investigating one cavity with @xmath27 higher - order dipole modes ( homs ) , each having a polarization angle @xmath28 to the horizontal . note that slightly polarized cavities often have at least two homs with similar characteristics , and looking at a single polarized hom can therefore be misleading .",
    "the unit vector in the direction of the polarization is @xmath29 .",
    "the effective transverse voltage in each hom is @xmath30 , so that a particle traversing this hom obtains a transverse - momentum change of @xmath31 .",
    "when @xmath32 is the vector of all these @xmath27 voltages , then the momentum change is @xmath33 when the particle returns to the cavity after the return time @xmath4 , the particle s position has changed by @xmath34 this position will increase the voltage in @xmath35 by the projection of the mode s wake field @xmath36 onto @xmath37 times the charge @xmath38 that excites the field , i.e. @xmath39 . integrating over all contributions to the hom potentials leads to @xmath40 with @xmath41 and therefore @xmath42 here @xmath43 is the current of the bunches that have already traveled for one turn ; in the approximation of short bunches it is given by @xmath44 this transforms the integral equation into @xmath45 where @xmath46 for @xmath47 .",

    "the transverse motion is stable when @xmath56 is zero for all @xmath26 with positive imaginary part .",
    "if the current is increased the motion can become unstable at which point @xmath56 is non - zero for at least one @xmath26 with positive imaginary part . at threshold",
    "it is therefore non - zero for a real value of @xmath26 .    as in @xcite",
    "we will use @xmath57 to allow for all recirculating phases , e.g. @xmath58 for an erl .",

    "<S> here we will derive the general theory of the beam - breakup instability in recirculating linear accelerators with coupled beam optics and with polarized higher order dipole modes . </S>",
    "<S> the bunches do not have to be at the same rf phase during each recirculation turn . </S>",
    "<S> this is important for the description of energy recovery linacs ( erls ) where beam currents become very large and coupled optics are used on purpose to increase the threshold current . </S>",
    "<S> this theory can be used for the analysis of phase errors of recirculated bunches , and of errors in the optical coupling arrangement . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown how the threshold current for a given linac can be computed and a remarkable agreement with tracking data is demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> the general formulas are then analyzed for several analytically solvable cases , which show : ( a ) why different higher order modes ( hom ) in one cavity can couple and can not be considered individually , even when their frequencies are separated by much more than the resonance widths of the homs . for the cornell erl as an example , it is noted that optimum advantage of coupled optics is taken when the cavities are designed with an @xmath0-@xmath1 hom frequency splitting of above 50mhz . </S>",
    "<S> the threshold current is then far above the design current of this accelerator . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) how the @xmath0-@xmath1 coupling in the particle optics determines when modes can be considered separately . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) that the increase of the threshold current obtainable by coupled optics and polarized modes diminishes roughly with the square root of the homs quality factors . therefore the largest advantages are achieved with cavities that are not specifically designed to minimize these quality factors , e.g. by means of hom absorbers . </S>",
    "<S> ( d ) how multiple - turn recirculation interferes with the threshold improvements obtained with a coupled optics . furthermore , the orbit deviations produced by cavity misalignments are also generalized to coupled optics . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the bbu instability always occurs before the orbit excursion becomes very large . </S>"
