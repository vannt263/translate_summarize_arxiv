    "[ pe ] , there are two different families of solutions that are candidates for this equilibrium situation , which we study separately in the following .",
    "we start by considering the solution . since the lower black hole is assumed to be sub - extremal , it has to satisfy @xmath247 .",

    "we obtain @xmath270 from this expression it follows that @xmath261 is positive only for @xmath271 due to @xmath272 for the allowed w - values @xmath253 , the interval in is always disjunct from the interval .",
    "hence , the adm mass is negative for this solution branch , too .",
    "therefore , we conclude that configurations with one degenerate and one sub - extremal black hole can not be in equilibrium .      in the situation with two degenerate objects , the equilibrium conditions have the solution families , and  but , as mentioned earlier , is physically equivalent to and needs therefore not to be treated separately here .    for the solution branch , the adm mass is given by @xmath273 which is obviously negative , such that this branch can be excluded immediately .",

    "since this inequality is related to cosmic censorship , such a violation might indicate that the investigated spacetimes do not possess a regular exterior vacuum region outside the two gravitational sources . and",
    "this is indeed what we observe : it can be shown ( see appendix  [ app ] ) that there are always _ singular rings _ at which the ernst potential @xmath57 diverges .",
    "since @xmath57 can be defined invariantly in terms of the two killing vectors , this behaviour is not just a coordinate effect but results from a physical singularity .",
    "therefore , this solution branch can be excluded , too .",
    "we have studied the question whether two - black - hole configurations containing degenerate black holes can be in stationary equilibrium .",
    "this question can be discussed in terms of a boundary value problem for the einstein equations . using the complex ernst formulation and the inverse scattering method we have solved this boundary value problem and shown that particular",
    "degenerate limits of the double - kerr - nut solution are the only candidates for the desired equilibrium configurations .",
    "however , as a careful discussion of these solutions has revealed , they all contain singularities outside the black holes and therefore do not represent physically acceptable black hole configurations . together with the corresponding result for non - degenerate two - black - hole configurations in @xcite ( paper i ) we have shown that axisymmetric and stationary configurations containing    * two sub - extremal black holes ( defined by existence of trapped surfaces just inside the event horizon ) , or * two degenerate black holes ( defined by vanishing surface gravity ) , or * one degenerate and one sub - extremal black hole    can not be in equilibrium .",
    "we would like to thank reinhard meinel for interesting discussions and ben whale for commenting on the manuscript .",
    "in this appendix we show that the second solution branch for configurations with two degenerate horizons has always singularities outside the two gravitational objects . for that purpose , we introduce dimensionless coordinates @xmath282 and @xmath283 by @xmath284 the ernst potential @xmath57 can then be written as @xmath285 with @xmath286\\nonumber\\\\         & &      + \\frac{{\\mathrm{i}}{\\varepsilon}}{4}\\left[4w_1w_2 ^ 2(2w_1\\pm1)\\tilde\\gamma_3                -(w_1 ^",
