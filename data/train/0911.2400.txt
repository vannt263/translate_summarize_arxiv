    "exact ( and somtimes analytical ) solutions of the schrdinger equation for realistic few - electron models of the quantum - dot - type provide a lot of unique opportunities .",
    "the physical essence of basic physical notions like the formation and distortion of wigner molecules ( wms ) and the consequences of inter - dot electron correlations in dot lattices can be understood more easily than with numerical brute - force approaches , which provide no formulas but only data . moreover",
    ", these phenomena can be monitored over a wide range of external parameter values , which allows us to tune the system continuously between the weakly and strongly correlated regime .",
    "intermediate and strong correlations are of particular interest , because for weak correlations there are a lot of mean - field approaches available .",
    "in particular we can easily see what the basic difference between strong correlated systems with low density ( wigner crystal ) and high magnetic fields ( fractional quantum hall systems ) is .",
    "further , exact solutions allow us to check the precision of approximations like hartree - fock and density functional approaches and to reveal their weak and strong points . unlike the comparison of approximate solutions for real systems with experiments , this approach has the advantage that all physical quantities ( including those which are not experimentally accessible ) can be considered , there are no experimental side effects , which obscure the comparison , and there are no discrepancies due to differences between the model and the real system .",
    "last but not least , basic mathematical assumptions about the structure of solutions ( like non - interacting @xmath3-representability in current density functional theory ) , which can not be proven for general systems , can sometimes be rejected for special systems .",
    "this paper is _ not _ a comprehensive review on quantum dots and quantum dot molecules and lattices . in particular",

    ", density matrix renormalization group  , current density functional  , and hartree - fock approaches .",
    "each of these methods warrants a separate review ( see e.g. ref.s @xcite and references therein ) . instead , this paper is focused on those systems which can be solved exactly or analytically , albeit the more complex sytems only in some limits for the external parameters .",
    "a problem with some exactly solvable models is that they have to be sufficiently simple and the question is whether all their features are shared by real systems of greater complexity .",
