    "it has been a common practice in the fluid dynamics to assume that when a fluid flows over an interface with a solid , the fluid molecules adjacent to the solid have zero relative velocity with the respect to solid .",
    "so far , this widely used assumption , known as `` no - slip boundary condition '' , has been successfully applied to the theoretical modeling of almost all macroscopic experiments . as relevantly noticed by craig et al .",
    "@xcite , the success of this assumption does not reflect its accuracy , but rather insensitivity of the experiment to a partial - slip boundary condition .",
    "it is known that the boundary slip becomes important only when the length scale over which the fluid velocity changes approaches the slip length , that is the distance behind the interface at which the fluid velocity extrapolates to zero , i.e. when the fluid becomes highly confined , e.g. , blood flow through capillaries or fluid flow through natural porous rock .",
    "recently , authors of refs .",
    "@xcite presented a convincing experimental evidence of a boundary slip in a newtonian liquid .",
    "they performed direct measurements of the hydrodynamic drainage forces , which show a clear evidence of boundary slip . also , they found that the boundary slip is a function of the fluid viscosity and the shear rate .",
    "these results have important implications for the blood dynamics in capillaries , the permeability of porous media , and lubrication of nano - machines .",
    "for example , results of craig et al .",
    "suggest that red blood cells squeeze through narrow capillary walls more easily and induce less shear stress on capillary walls due to the boundary slip .",
    "also , in oil production industry , the residual oil is difficult to produce due to its naturally low mobility .",
    "thus , the enhanced oil recovery operations are used to increase production .",
    "it has been experimentally proven and theoretically validated that there is a substantial increase in the net fluid flow through a porous medium if the latter is treated with elastic waves @xcite .",
    "we may conjecture that the elastic waves via the pore wall vibration cause boundary slip of the residual oil droplets , which likewise red blood cells , squeeze through pores with less resistance , effectively increasing permeability of the porous medium .",
    "a quantitative theory of propagation of elastic waves in a fluid - saturated porous solid has been formulated in the classic paper by biot @xcite .",
    "after its appearance , this theory has seen numerous modifications and generalizations .",
    "one of the major findings of biot s work was that there was a breakdown in poiseuille flow above a certain characteristic frequency specific to this fluid - saturated porous material .",
    "biot theoretically studied this breakdown by considering the flow of a viscous fluid in a tube with longitudinally oscillating walls under an oscillatory pressure gradient .",
    "biot s theory can be used to describe interaction of fluid - saturated porous solid with sound for a classic newtonian fluid assuming no - slip boundary condition at the pore walls holds . however , in the light of recent experimental results of ref .",
    "@xcite , revision of the classic theory is needed in order to investigate novelties bought about by the boundary slip .",
    "biot s theory has been a successful tool for interpreting the experimental data for decades , but there are circumstances when it fails .",
    "gist @xcite performed ultrasonic velocity and attenuation measurements in sandstones with a variety of saturating fluids and compared the data with the predictions of the biot s theory .",
    "_ velocity data show systematic deviations from biot theory as a function of pore fluid viscosity .",
    "ultrasonic attenuation is much larger than the biot prediction _ and for several sandstones is nearly constant for a three decade variation in viscosity .",
    "this behavior contrasts with synthetic porous media such as sintered glass beads , where biot theory provides accurate predictions of both velocity and attenuation .",
    "the similar claim has been also made by earlier experimental studies e.g. ref .",
    "even biot himself acknowledged @xcite that the model of a purely elastic solid matrix saturated with a viscous fluid is rather idealistic and there are rare occasions where it gives satisfactory agreement with the experiment .",
    "thus , he generalized theory applying the correspondence principle , and incorporated the solid and fluid attenuation , and dissipation due to non - connected pores . in this work biot",
    "introduced the viscodynamic operator , which is a sum of the viscosity and inertial terms , and it accounts for the dynamic properties of the fluid motions in pores valid for the both low and high frequencies .",
    "the theory can model other , more complex , mechanisms such as thermoelastic dissipation , which produce a relaxation spectrum , or local flow mechanisms as the squirt flow @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a time domain formulation based on memory variables has been also successfully introduced @xcite , @xcite . in order to narrow down the source of discrepancy between biot theory and experiment , gist @xcite tried to modify natural sandstone by curing a residual saturation of epoxy in the pore space , filling small pores and micro - cracks .",
    "this altered rock has a significantly reduced attenuation , demonstrating the dominance of small pores in controlling ultrasonic attenuation .",
    "then he suggested that two non - biot viscous attenuation mechanisms are needed : local flow in micro - cracks along grain contacts , and attenuation from pore - wall surface roughness . the model model based on these two mechanisms seemed to succeed in improvement of fitting the data .",
    "however , this by no means does not exclude other possibilities , and all plausible effects that could explain the discrepancy should be explored . at low frequencies ,",
    "the fluid flow is of poiseuille type and the inertia effects are obviously negligible in comparison with the effects of the viscosity . at high frequencies , however , these effects are confined to a thin boundary layer in the vicinity of the pore walls and the inertia forces are dominant .",
    "therefore , _ we conjecture that in such situations , apart from other yet unknown effects , non - zero boundary slip effect maybe responsible for the deviations between the theory and experiment_. this justifies our aim to formulate a model that would account for the boundary slip .    in the section",
    "ii we formulate theoretical basis of our model and in section iii we present our numerical results . in the section",
    "iv we conclude with the discussion of the results .",
    "in our model we study a newtonian fluid flowing in a cylindrical tube , which mimics a natural pore , whose walls are oscillating longitudinally and the fluid is subject to an oscillatory pressure gradient .",
    "we give analytical solutions of the problem in the frequency domain .",
    "the governing equation of the problem is the linearized momentum equation of an incompressive fluid @xmath2 here , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 denote velocity , pressure and mass density of the fluid , while @xmath6 is the viscosity coefficient .",
    "now , let @xmath7 be a velocity of the wall of the tube which oscillates in time as @xmath8 .",
    "the flow of fluid in a cylindrical tube with longitudinally oscillating walls can be described by a singe component of the velocity , namely , its @xmath9-component @xmath10 ( @xmath9 axis is along the centerline of the tube ) .",
    "we use cylindrical coordinate system @xmath11 in treatment of the problem .",
    "we introduce the relative velocity @xmath12 as @xmath13 .",
    "thus , assuming that all physical quantities vary in time as @xmath8 , we arrive at the following master equation for @xmath12 @xmath14 here , we have introduced the following notations : @xmath15 which is a sum of the applied pressure gradient and force exerted on the fluid from the oscillating wall of the tube and , @xmath16 , which is @xmath17 .",
    "the solution of eq.(2 ) can be found to be @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the bessel function and @xmath20 .",
    "assuming that the slip velocity is @xmath21 at the wall of the tube , where @xmath22 is its radius , we obtain @xmath23 .",
    "\\eqno(3)\\ ] ] here , @xmath24    defining the cross - section averaged velocity as @xmath25 we obtain @xmath26 .",
    "\\eqno(4)\\ ] ]    following work of biot @xcite we calculate the stress at the wall @xmath27 , @xmath28    the total friction force is @xmath29 . following biot we calculate the ratio of total friction force to the average velocity , i.e. @xmath30 @xmath31^{-1}. \\eqno(6)\\ ] ] simple analysis reveals that ( assuming @xmath32 as @xmath33 , see discussion below ) @xmath34 which corresponds to the limiting case of poiseuille flow . following biot @xcite , we also introduce a function @xmath0 with @xmath1 being frequency parameter , @xmath35 , in the following manner @xmath36 thus , @xmath37 @xmath38^{-1}. \\eqno(7)\\ ] ] note , that @xmath0 measures the deviation from poiseuille flow friction as a function of frequency parameter @xmath1 . the biot s expression for @xmath0 in the no boundary slip regime can be easily recovered from eq.(7 ) by putting @xmath32 for all @xmath1 s .",
    "so far , we did not specify @xmath39 , however there are certain physical constraints it should satisfy :    \\(a ) authors of ref .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the slip length ( which , in fact , is proportional to the slip velocity ) is a function of the approach rate and they showed why several previous careful measurement of confined liquids have not observed evidence for boundary slip . under",
    "the low approach rates employed in previous measurements slip length is zero and no - slip boundary condition is applicable .",
    "experiments reported in ref .",
    "@xcite were performed when half - sphere approached a plane with liquid placed in - between at different approach rates .",
    "however , we should clearly realize what term `` approach rate '' means in the context of biot s theory : biot investigated fluid flow in the cylindrical tube whose walls are harmonically oscillating in the longitudinal direction as @xmath40 , therefore if similar to ref.@xcite experiment would be done for the oscillation tube , the `` approach rate '' would be the amplitude of @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath42 .",
    "thus , when @xmath33 , @xmath39 should also tend to zero .",
    "\\(b ) at high frequencies the viscous effects are negligible compared to the inertial effects .",
    "thus , fluid at high frequencies behaves as an ideal ( non - viscous ) pore fluid , which allows for an arbitrary slip .",
    "therefore , when @xmath43 , @xmath39 should tend to zero . when we examine fig .  6 from ref.@xcite and fig .  3 ( bottom panel ) from ref.@xcite",
    "closely we should understand that the authors measured ascending part where slip length increases with the increase of the approach ( flow ) rate .",
    "since , the viscous effects should be negligible compared to the inertial effects for large approach rates , there must be also a descending part  clearly slip length ( or the same as slip velocity ) can not grow infinitely as approach rate increases .",
    "viscous effects should give in to the inertial effects and fluid should behave an ideal fluid allowing for an arbitrary slip .",
    "based upon the above two physical arguments we conclude that @xmath39 should be a smooth function which tends to zero when @xmath44 ( or the same as @xmath1 ) tends to both zero and @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , we postulate following _ phenomenological _ expression for @xmath39 @xmath46=im [ \\bar u_s(\\kappa ) ] = \\xi { { b \\kappa^4}\\over{(a+\\kappa^2)^5}}\\ ] ] this function has a maximum at @xmath47 . by fixing @xmath48 at @xmath49 we force it to achieve its maximum equal to unity at @xmath50 ( when @xmath51 ) .",
    "we introduced @xmath52 ( usually @xmath53 ) as a sort of `` weight '' of the boundary slip effect into the solution .",
    "putting , @xmath54 this way would easily allow us to recover no - slip case , while the increase of @xmath52 we would be able to trace effect of non - zero slip onto the all physical quantities .",
    "we plot this function in fig .  1 for @xmath55 and @xmath51 .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that , at first glance , it seems that non - zero boundary slip , which appears at `` high approach rates '' , should be attributed to the non - linear effects . however , thorough interpretation of the experimental results of ref .",
    "@xcite , in the context of the oscillatory tube ( see points ( a ) and ( b ) above ) allows us to conclude that the non - zero boundary slip can be also incorporated into the _ linear _ biot s theory .    next , we plot both @xmath56 $ ] and @xmath57 $ ] in fig .  2 for the three cases : when there is no boundary slip ( @xmath54 ) , and @xmath58 .",
    "we gather from the plot that the @xmath54 is identical to fig .  4 from ref.@xcite as it should be .",
    "however , we also notice a noticeable difference from the classic case when @xmath52 is non - zero in the _ intermediate _ frequencies domain . of course , according to our definition of the phenomenological form of @xmath59 , even for non - zero @xmath52 ( non - zero boundary slip ) , when @xmath60 and @xmath61 , asymptotically @xmath0 behaves as classic biot s solution @xcite , i.e. @xmath62 and @xmath63    @xmath64 since in our phenomenological model we allow for the deviations in the intermediate frequency domain , it is easy to foresee that these will have an impact on all of the predictions of the biot s theory precisely in that frequency range .",
    "namely , all observable quantities predicted by the biot s theory , such as phase velocities and attenuation coefficients of the both rotational and dilatational waves will be affected by the introduction of boundary slip into the model in the intermediate frequency range .",
    "biot @xcite showed that the general equations which govern propagation of rotational and dilatational high - frequency waves in a fluid - saturated porous medium are the same as in the low - frequency range provided the viscosity is replaced by its effective value as a function of frequency . in practice , it means replacing the resistance coefficient @xmath65 by @xmath66 .",
    "the equations describing dynamics of the rotational waves are @xcite @xmath67 @xmath68 where , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are mass density parameters for the solid and fluid and their inertia coupling ; @xmath71 and @xmath72 describe rotations of solid and fluid with @xmath73 and @xmath74 being their displacement vectors , while the rigidity of the solid is represented by the modulus @xmath75 .",
    "substitution of a plane rotational wave of the form @xmath76 into eqs.(11 ) and ( 12 ) allows us to obtain a characteristic equation @xmath77 where @xmath78 is wavenumber , @xmath79 is wave cyclic frequency , @xmath80 is the mass density of the bulk material and @xmath22 is a pore radius .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of eq.(14 ) can be written as @xmath81 and @xmath82 where @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "the function @xmath0 was written here more conveniently as a function of frequency @xmath86 , i.e. @xmath87 @xcite , where @xmath88 is a factor dependent on pore geometry .",
    "for the hollow cylinder - like pores , @xmath89 @xcite and we use this value throughout the paper .",

    "11 and 12 from ref .",
    "we gather from the graph that introduction of the non - zero boundary slip leads to decrease of @xmath136 , while @xmath137 increases in the in the domain of intermediate frequencies as boundary slip , @xmath52 , increases .    in figs .  7 and 8 we plot",

    "_ higher _ than in the no boundary slip case values of the attenuation coefficients for both types of the dilatational waves in the domain of intermediate frequencies , which , again , is in qualitative agreement with the experimental results @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that for no - zero @xmath52 the asymptotic behavior of the elastic waves in the @xmath142 as well as @xmath143 limit is identical to the classic behavior established by biot @xcite .",

    "in this paper we have studied the effect of introduction of the boundary slip in the theory of propagation of elastic waves in a fluid - saturated porous solid originally formulated by biot @xcite .",
    "biot s theory does not account for boundary slip effect , however , the boundary slip becomes important when the length scale over which the fluid velocity changes approaches the slip length , i.e. when the fluid is highly confined , for instance , fluid flow through porous rock or blood vessel capillaries . in the light of recent convincing experimental evidence of a boundary slip in a newtonian liquid @xcite ,",

    "we have performed such analysis , and in summary , we found that the introduction of the non - zero boundary slip into the biot s theory of propagation of the elastic waves in a fluid - saturated porous solid results in    * the decrease , as compared to the no - slip limiting case , of the phase velocities of both rotational waves ( @xmath131 ) and dilatational wave of the first kind ( @xmath144 ) in the domain of intermediate frequencies . on contrary",

    "therefore , our results would be useful for various applications in oil production as well as in ecology .",
    "from the recent experimental results of ref.@xcite we gathered that there are physical situations were the no - slip boundary condition becomes invalid .",
