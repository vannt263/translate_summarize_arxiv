    "the regularity of solutions at @xmath15 is a delicate issue : the linearized problem was studied by brezis and vazquez in @xcite in great detail . in particular , when the domain is a ball , and for the exponential and power nonlinearities mentioned above , the solutions at the critical value @xmath16 are uniformly bounded in dimensions less or equal to @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , while in higher dimensions they are unbounded . for more general nonlinearities @xmath19 and",
    "domains @xmath20 , regularity of solutions at @xmath15 in dimensions @xmath21 has been established by nedev @xcite , and more recently in dimension @xmath22 by cabr @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the non - selfadjoint elliptic problem @xmath23 with a prescribed incompressible flow @xmath24 so that @xmath25 .",
    "extension of the aforementioned results to the case when a flow is present is a natural question in the context of the original motivation for the study of ( [ intro - ellipt ] ) as the explosion problem @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is to understand how the presence of an underlying flow and its features affect the explosion limit .",
    "existence of a critical explosion threshold @xmath26 can be established as a straightforward generalization of existing methods .",
    "we are mostly interested here in the qualitative dependence of @xmath26 on the flow @xmath27  whether a flow may raise or lower the explosion threshold , and in the asymptotic behavior of @xmath26 in the limit of a strong flow .",
    "intuitively , a flow improves mixing and interaction with the boundary  hence one may expect that an incompressible flow would always raise the explosion threshold . somewhat surprisingly , this was shown not necessarily to be the case in @xcite .",
    "more precisely , berestycki , kagan , joulin and sivashinsky have considered in @xcite , the problem ( [ elliptic ] ) for a two - dimensional cellular flow and observed numerically that while the explosion threshold increases for flows oscillating on a small scale , it may actually decrease if the flow has large scale variations .",
    "this is because such flows may promote creation of hot spots where the explosion would happen faster than without any flow .",
    "the authors of @xcite have also presented a formal asymptotic analysis and found an effective problem in the limit of the large flow amplitude .",
    "the fully nonlinear problem when the flow itself satisfies a navier - stokes type equation coupled to the explosion problem for temperature has been studied in @xcite using numerics and formal asymptotics .",
    "recently , some rigorous results for the behavior of the solutions to the coupled system in the regime of a strong gravity have been obtained in @xcite .",
    "here we derive several qualitative properties of the explosion threshold @xmath26 in terms of the geometry and the amplitude of the flow @xmath27 .      in the following",
    "we always assume that @xmath20 is a smooth bounded domain in @xmath28 , @xmath24 is a @xmath29 divergence - free flow ( @xmath30 in @xmath20 ) .",
    "our first proposition establishes the direct analog of the classical results for ( [ intro - ellipt ] ) and allows us to define the critical parameter @xmath26 .",

    "the proof of this result is very close to that in @xcite  we present it below both for the convenience of the reader and since we will use some of the intermediate steps in what follows .",
    "another reason to discuss the proofs for @xmath40 is that some of the basic results in the self - adjoint case @xmath41 rely on the variational characterization of the principal eigenvalue of the linearized operator @xmath42 which we do not have when the flow is present .",
    "the next theorem shows that the possible creation of hot spots can not drop the explosion threshold arbitrarily close to zero , no matter what the incompressible flow @xmath24 is .",
    "[ thm - lowerbd ] for any domain @xmath20 and nonlinearity @xmath5 there exists @xmath43 so that the critical threshold @xmath26 for ( [ elliptic ] ) satisfies @xmath44 for all incompressible flows @xmath24 in @xmath20 .",
    "the constant @xmath45 depends on @xmath20 and the function @xmath46 .",
    "this result does not hold without the restriction that the flow @xmath24 is incompressible  we describe in section [ sec : uniform ] examples of flows for which @xmath16 may be as small as one wishes .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm - lowerbd ] involves the following uniform @xmath0 bound for solutions of the dirichlet problem for elliptic diffusion - advection problems with the constant independent of the incompressible flow .",

    "there exists a constant @xmath51 which depends on @xmath52 and the domain @xmath20 but not on the flow @xmath24 , so that @xmath53 .",
    "these results raise several interesting open questions .",
    "first , can one identify the optimal constant @xmath54 in ( [ lbd - lem ] ) ?",
    "more importantly , we would like to pose as an open problem to know whether in all domains with smooth boundaries a flow realizing the best constant in lemma  [ lem - lp - linfty ] exists .",
    "the same question pertains to the smallest possible explosion threshold in theorem  [ thm - lowerbd ] : does the flow minimizing @xmath26 over all incompressible flows exist in any domain @xmath20 ?",
    "if so , what are its geometric characteristics ? numerical simulations in  @xcite indicate that a natural guess that @xmath41 turns out not to be correct for all domains as an incompressible flow may create additional hot spots .",
    "more precisely , it has been numerically computed in  @xcite that in a very long rectangle the explosion threshold corresponding to a cellular flow with a certain finite positive amplitude is smaller than that corresponding to @xmath41 .",
    "however , it is not clear whether in the situation when @xmath41 is not a minimizer of @xmath26 , such a minimizer exists at all , or if minimizing flows do not exist .",
    "when it exists , how is it determined ?",
    "let us now fix a flow profile @xmath24 and consider the explosion problem ( [ elliptic ] ) with a strong flow @xmath55 , with a large flow amplitude @xmath56 : @xmath57 we are interested in the behavior of the explosion threshold @xmath58 for ( [ elliptic - strong ] ) in the limit @xmath59 .",
    "let us recall that a function @xmath60 is a first integral of @xmath27 if @xmath61 a.e . in @xmath20 .",
    "[ thm5 ] we have @xmath62 as @xmath63 if and only if @xmath27 has no non - zero first integrals in @xmath64 .",

    "the proof uses the ideas from @xcite and @xcite together with some techniques of @xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , the explosion threshold tends to infinity as @xmath63 under the same assumptions as the principal dirichlet eigenvalue of the operator @xmath66 ( see @xcite ) , as both quantities measure the effectiveness of the enhancement of the boundary cooling due to the flow .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : cellflow ] , we consider the effective problem for ( [ elliptic - strong ] ) in the limit @xmath59 for the class of two - dimensional cellular flows . we show that in this limit , the various cells of the flow `` do not talk to each other '' .",
    "the main result of that section is theorem  [ cf - fr - thm ] . in particular , when @xmath63 , the explosion threshold @xmath58 is close to the explosion threshold on the `` largest '' cell in @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , the explosion threshold for each of the individual flow cells in the limit @xmath63 has an asymptotic description in terms of the freidlin problem .",
    "we recall that the fast flow asymptotics for the parabolic reaction - diffusion equations in flows without cells has been treated by m. freidlin in @xcite , and our results for the elliptic explosion problem in the special case of one cell flows are what one would expect formally from @xcite .",
    "the most interesting and delicate new ingredient is the independent behavior of the solutions in various cells when @xmath63 .",
    "we mention that unlike in  @xcite , our proofs are not probabilistic in nature . actually , as a by - product of the present paper",
