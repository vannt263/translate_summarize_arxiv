    "only three supernova remnants ( snrs ) have been unambiguously confirmed to be crab - like : snr 0540 - 69.3 , msh 15 - 52 , and the crab nebula itself .",
    "these remnants show centrally peaked morphologies and flat emission spectra ; the emission comes predominantly from synchrotron nebulae powered by embedded young pulsars .",
    "there are a number of snrs that have similar morphologies and spectral characteristics , but contain no detected pulsars .",
    "n157b is such a remnant ( mills , turtle , & watkinson 1978 ; clark et al .",
    "1982 ; mathewson et al . 1983 ; wang & helfand 1991 ; chu et al . 1992  cksl92 hereafter ; dickel et al . 1994",
    " d94 hereafter ) . like snr 0540 - 69.3 , n157b is in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and thus has a good distance determination .",
    "but , previous observations have shown no clear correspondence between the morphologies of n157b in radio , optical , and x - ray .",
    "the remnant s age of @xmath9  yrs , inferred from kinematics of optical features ( cksl92 ) is also much greater ( by a factor of about 10 ) than the confirmed crab - like snrs .",
    "no radio polarized emission has been detected from n157b , as might be expected for a synchrotron nebula ( d94 ) . in short",
    ", the exact nature of the remnant has been uncertain .",
    "here we report new results on n157b , based primarily on observations from the and x - ray observatories .",
    "these observations provide much improved timing , imaging , and spectral resolution capabilities . for comparison",
    ", we also present the results of analyzing a 40  ks observation on snr 0540 - 69.3 .",
    "we describe the reduction of the x - ray observations in  2 , and present our analysis and results in  3 .",
    "then in  4 , we discuss the implications of our results , together with previous observations , and postulate scenarios to explain various components of n157b .",
    "we summarize our results and conclusions in  5 .",
    "appendix a describes an algorithm we used for extracting spectra with correction for the instrument point spread function ( psf ) . throughout the paper ,",
    "we adopt an lmc distance @xmath10  kpc ( gould 1995 ) , at which @xmath11 corresponds to @xmath12  pc .",
    "table 1 summarizes parameters of the two observations used in this study .",
    "both observations were acquired during _ asca _ s performance verification phase , and the data were made available through the public archive . since the has two types of instruments , which observe simultaneously , a pair of solid - state imaging spectrometers ( sis ) and a pair of gas imaging spectrometers ( gis ) , the two observations yielded eight sets of data : four from the siss and four from the giss .",
    "the sis has an energy coverage approximately in the 0.5 - 8  kev range , and the gis in the 0.8 - 10  kev range ( tanaka , inoue , & holt 1994 ) .",
    "data from the sis detectors were collected in 4-ccd faint and bright modes .",
    "the data were processed by converting the faint mode data to bright mode equivalent data and by filtering the combined set through the standard cleaning criteria .",
    "ccd pixels with anomalous counts were identified and excluded using the cleansis technique ( gotthelf 1993 ) .",
    "detailed procedures of these methods can be found in day et al .",
    "1 presents an exposure corrected , smoothed sis image of the 30 dor region created by combining screened data from both observations .",
    "the sis data are the most useful in our spectral study of n157b , because of both the broad - band energy coverage and the good spectral resolution ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the spatial resolution of the data is , however , limited by the poor point spread function ( psf ) of the telescope .",
    "although the psf has a sharp core with a fwhm of @xmath14 , the broad wing of the psf produces a 50% encircled radius of @xmath15 ( jalota , gotthelf , & zoonematkermani 1992 ) .",
    "the psf also contains some energy dependence which is most notable above @xmath16 kev .",
    "the broad wing of the psf prevents an _ independent _ measurement of the background in the region of the source uncontaminated by the source spectrum itself .",
    "we thus devised a method that simultaneously solves for both the source and background spectra ( see appendix a for details ) .",
    "we applied this method to determine the spectra for both n157b and snr 0540 - 69.3 . to minimize the uncertainties in the spectral background subtraction , we chose a small on - source aperture of radius 17 , and a concentric background annulus with its inner and outer radii of 23 and 49 .",
    "we further used only the southwest half of the background annulus around n157b to avoid the possible contamination by the 30 dor nebula in the northeastern half of the annulus . within the on - source aperture of this remnant , the background accounts for about 7% of the total observed intensity with a relatively soft spectrum .",
    "judging from the background intensity variation around n157b , the uncertainty in the background should be less than @xmath17 .",
    "this uncertainty in the background subtraction is probably within the systematic error of the data and the analysis .",
    "for each sis data set of n157b we generated an appropriate background spectral file to match the on - source file .",
    "these spectra were then summed for both ccd detectors and for both observations .",
    "individual response files were summed to create an appropriate count weighted multi - ccd detector and multi - telescope response matrix .",
    "the summation was accomplished using the ftool mathpha to add  spectral files , and the combined instrument / response files were merged using the ftool addrmf .",
    "the spectra were binned to contain at least 25 counts for @xmath18 model fits .",
    "our final spectral analysis of n157b was based on this summed spectrum and response .",
    "we also conducted fits to the four sets of spectra before the summation , and found that the results were consistent with those from fits to the summed spectrum , which was certainly much easier to analyze and made multi - component model fits possible .",
    "the gis data are the most suitable for timing analysis to search for a putative pulsar in n157b .",
    "all the gis data , acquired in the highest ph time resolution mode ( 10 bit ) , sets a limit on the timing accuracy during space - craft telemetry down - links of  0.3 milli - seconds for high bit - rate . however , the calibration of the absolute time ( ascatime ) , is only considered accurate to about 2.0 ms ( hirayama et al .",
    "1996 , news no .",
    "a pulsar search which combined high and medium bit - rate mode data limits the overall accuracy to 5 ms ; low - bit rate mode data was excluded from our pulsar search .",
    "we converted the arrival time of each count to the barycentric dynamical time , using the ftool task timeconv .",
    "we also extracted a gis light - curve from the observation of psr 0540 - 69.3 to be used as a control on our procedure .",
    "the sis data are of limited use in timing analysis .",
    "the 4 ccd mode sis observation of n157b used a 16 s integration ( time between ccd read - out ) , setting a fundamental limit on searches for frequencies faster than 0.03125 hz , the appropriate nyquist frequency .",
    "we utilized two observations from the high resolution imager ( rhri ) and one from the positional sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) .",
    "both the pspc and rhri were sensitive to photons in the @xmath19  kev range .",
    "the rhri observations with a psf of @xmath20 ( fwhm ) are the best for studying the spatial properties of n157b .",
    "one of the rhri observations ( seq .",
    "rh600228 ) with an effective exposure of 30094  s was pointed at r136 , @xmath21 away from n157b ; the other ( wh500036 ) of 4460  s was pointed directly at n157b .",
    "each rhri observation covers a field of @xmath22 diameter . a coadded intensity image of the two observations is presented in fig .",
    "the processing of the observations was described in an earlier article by wang ( 1995 ) , where the same two observations were used to detect two point - like x - ray sources in the 30 dor core region and to identify them as wolf - rayet + black hole binaries .",
    "briefly , small astrometric errors ( @xmath23 ) were corrected through comparisons between optical and x - ray positions of identified x - ray sources in the region .",
    "therefore , the absolute astrometric accuracy of the observations is better than @xmath23 .",
    "the pspc observation ( rp500131 ) , targeted at r136 ( chu et al .",
    "1993 ) , was used to offer a useful combination of moderate spatial resolution ( fwhm @xmath24 ) and spectral resolving capability ( about six independent bands in the 0.1 - 2  kev range ) .",
    "the spatial resolution of the pspc , though not as good as that of the rhri , was still significantly better than the instruments .",
    "we extracted a spectrum of n157b from the pspc observation , using an aperture of 15 for the on - source count rate and an annulus between 2@xmath25 - 35 radii for the background estimation .",
    "the aperture is large enough to contain essentially all the counts from the remnant .",
    "the total background - subtracted count rate is @xmath26 in the pspc 0.1 - 2  kev band .",
    "similarly , we obtained the rhri count rate of @xmath27 in the same aperture .",
    "we found that the pspc and rhri observations provided no strong constraints on the timing properties of n157b .",
    "the observations were taken in various time segments spreading over a long period of time  about a half year in the case of rh600228 .",
    "we conducted an extensive search for pulsed emission from n157b . to familiarize ourselves with various methods used , we applied them first to snr 0540 - 69.3 , which contains a known pulsar .",
    "it was easy to detect the pulsar s period of 0.05041843  s , even with one tenth of the snr s data . above 2  kev ,",
    "the pulsed fraction is @xmath28 , almost independent of photon energy .",
    "but the fraction falls to @xmath29 in the 1 - 2  kev range and to @xmath30 below 1  kev , apparently because of soft diffuse emission from the remnant .",
    "no significant periodic signal , however , was detected from n157b , confirming the preliminary conclusion reached by itoh et al .",
    "( 1994 ) . in the following ,",
    "we concentrate on describing our timing analysis of n157b with the gis data .",
    "we made an fft analysis of the combined light curve of the two gis detectors .",
    "this analysis is sensitive to the period range from 3  ms to about 2000  s. the lower boundary is chiefly due to the number of time bins allowed by our computer memory , and the upper limit to various observing intervals or gaps on timescales comparable to , or greater than , 2000  s. a single fft of the light curve is the most sensitive , but is limited to the period range longer than 0.05  s. for shorter periods , we first divided the total observing time into up to 16 equal time intervals , and then applied fft separately to the individual light curves .",
    "the derived power spectra were averaged to form a combined spectrum , where we found no significant peak .",
    "we even tried the incoherent harmonics addition ( e.g. , lyne & graham - smith 1990 ) to strengthen harmonics , in case the pulse shape was narrow . but no consistent harmonic pattern was discovered .",
    "we further utilized a period folding method , but again detected no significant signal .",
    "a @xmath18 fit with a sinusoidal waveform to a folded pulse profile at an fft peak period typically yielded a pulsed fraction of @xmath31 .",
    "by re - sampling counts according to the `` best - fit '' model , we estimated a 99% upper limit to the pulsed fraction as @xmath32 in the energy band @xmath33  kev .",
    "the limit for a sharper pulse profile would be tighter . a similar analysis with the pspc data gave an upper limit as @xmath34 in the 0.5 - 2  kev band .",
    "figs .  1 and 2 provide global views of the region including both n157b and the 30 doradus nebula .",
    "the rhri image shows that n157b is well separated from the main body of the 30 dor nebula .",
    "but in the sis map , scattered x - rays can be considerable near n157b at energies @xmath35  kev .",
    "3 presents close - ups of n157b in x - ray , compared with images in h@xmath36 and in radio continuum . the northeastern half of the pspc image ( fig .",
    "3a ) shows a clear excess of diffuse x - ray radiation , but this diffuse enhancement is harder to see in the raw distribution of rhri counts ( fig .",
    "3b ) , which include a large number of non - cosmic x - ray events .",
    "the low surface brightness diffuse emission is , however , evident in the smoothed rhri maps ( figs .",
    "the distinct part of the enhancement , outlined by the lowest solid contour level ( @xmath37 ) in fig .",
    "3c , is somewhat square - shaped , and has a dimension of @xmath38 .",
    "on top of the low surface brightness diffuse x - ray emission is a comet - shaped x - ray feature .",
    "the extended morphology of this feature , similar in the two rhri observations , can not be due to any instrumental effects .",
    "point - like objects in the field do not show such elongation ( fig .  2 ; wang 1995 ) .",
    "this feature has a position angle of @xmath39 west to the north . at the southeastern end of the feature",
    "is a compact source ( @xmath40 ) , which appears extended in rh600228 .",
    "a maximum likelihood fit to the count distribution of the source suggests count rate of @xmath41 and a psf - subtracted 90% upper limit to the source s full gaussian size as @xmath42 .",
    "but an extent of a few arcseconds could be caused by the pointing `` jitter '' of .",
    "thus , the source is only marginally resolved , at the best .    a different perspective of the data is presented in fig .  4 , where individual cuts of the rhri intensity distribution are plotted .",
    "the compact source of the comet - shaped x - ray feature appears broader than the rhri psf ( fig .",
    "4a ) , although part of this broadening may be due to the pointing uncertainty in the observation rh600228 .",
    "the broad shoulder on the right ( northwestern ) side of the peak gives an estimate of the length of the x - ray feature as @xmath43 .",
    "the total width of the feature is @xmath44 ( fig .",
    "table 2 summarizes the properties of the individual x - ray components",
    ".      figs .",
    "5 and 6 show a remarkable similarity between the sis spectra of snr 0540 - 69.3 and n157b .",
    "both spectra are flat and contain no apparent line features above 1.5  kev , setting these two remnants apart from young shell - like lmc snrs studied by hughes et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . in the sis spectra of the shell - like snrs , strong lines _",
    ", and weak continua fall steeply above @xmath45  kev .",
    "the spectra of snr 0540 - 69.3 and n157b show low energy turnovers at @xmath45  kev , indicating that the absorption is mainly due to oxygen and neon .",
    "the interstellar abundances of these elements are measured typically within the range between 30 - 40% solar in the lmc ( russell & dopita 1992 ; de boer et al .",
    "1985 ) , and around 40 - 60% solar in the solar neighborhood ( e.g. , meyer 1995 ) .",
    "because the column density of the milky way in the direction is only @xmath46 ( bessell 1991 ) , the absorption in the lmc dominates .",
    "we assumed an average metal abundance of 40% solar for x - ray - absorbing gas ( morrison & mccammon 1983 ) toward both n157b and snr 0540 - 69.3 .",
    "a slightly different choice of the metal abundance would only affect the equivalent hydrogen column density @xmath47 in a spectral fit , but would hardly affect the fitting of other spectral parameters .",
    "table 3 summarizes spectral parameters from various fits to the spectral data of the two remnants .",
    "the spectrum of snr 0540 - 69.3 is well fitted with a simple power law .",
    "the power law slope is in good agreement with that obtained by finley et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , whose analysis is based on a pspc spectrum and assumes a solar metal abundance .",
    "switching the abundance in our fit to the solar value and fixing the slope to their best - fit value 1.0 , we obtained almost the same @xmath47 and 0.1 - 2.4  kev band flux as theirs .",
    "this comparison suggests no gross inconsistency between the and data .    a power law , however , does not fit the spectrum of n157b as satisfactorily as that of snr 0540 - 69.3 .",
    "the power law fit of the n157b spectrum can be rejected at the @xmath48 confidence .",
    "the residuals of the fit ( fig .",
    "6 ) exhibit significant systematic fluctuations on energy scales of @xmath49  kev , indicating possible emission line contributions from an optically - thin thermal plasma .",
    "the feature at @xmath50  kev , however , appears a bit too narrow , and its astronomical nature may be questioned , although a stronger line of similar width at @xmath45  kev has been reported in the spectrum of the nearby x - ray binary system 4u1626 - 67 ( angelini et al .",
    "other possible line features are at @xmath51  kev and @xmath52  kev .",
    "to probe the significance of the line features and the thermal plasma component in general , we made a joint spectral analysis of the sis and pspc spectra of n157b .",
    "first , we fitted the two spectra with a power law , allowing the model normalizations to vary independently .",
    "a significant excess around @xmath53  kev is apparent in the pspc spectrum ( fig .",
    "7 ) , even greater than that in the sis spectrum .",
    "an inclusion of a simple gaussian line improves the fit significantly , reducing the @xmath54 from 197/150 to 171/146 ; the excess is gone in the residuals for both the sis and pspc spectra ( fig .",
    "8 ; table  3 ) .",
    "the line in the pspc spectrum has a flux 3.5 ( 2.4 - 5.5)@xmath55 at @xmath56  kev .",
    "the flux in the sis spectrum is , however , only 45(21 - 68)% of that in the pspc spectrum , whereas the power law normalizations in the sis and pspc spectra are very close ( within @xmath57 ) .",
    "this line flux discrepancy can be explained if the thermal component originates in the low surface brightness diffuse emission region ( table  2 ) .",
    "part of the diffuse emission is not accounted for in our extraction of the sis spectra , which assumes the remnant to be point - like .",
    "we further tried the standard collisionally equilibrium plasma model ( i.e. , raymond & smith 1994 , r&s hereafter ) . for simplicity , we discuss here only the results from the fits to the sis spectrum .",
    "a single - temperature model fit is not satisfactory ; the best - fit model is much steeper than the sis spectrum at energies @xmath58  kev .",
    "such a thermal model is , however , perfectly acceptable for the _ einstein _ sss data , partly because of the instrument s narrower energy coverage @xmath59  kev .",
    "the absorption inferred from the sss spectrum is also significantly smaller than the value obtained from the data .",
    "we suspect that this is caused by a considerable soft x - ray contribution from the main body of 30 dor within the sss aperture of @xmath60 diameter .",
    "therefore , the results from the sss spectrum should be used with caution . a two - component model consisting of a power law and an r&s plasma",
    "improves our power law fit to the sis spectrum only slightly ( @xmath61 ) ; the thermal component , even with the abundance allowed to vary , does not adequately account for the apparent line features . without accurate information on the remnant s environment , structure , and evolution , we are unable to use the limited statistics and line signatures of the data to explore the vast parameter space of more sophisticated models",
    ".    the power - law contribution may be determined , however , if it is solely due to the comet - shaped feature , presumably a synchrotron nebula (  4.3 ) .",
    "we used the rhri count rate of @xmath62 ( table  2 ; with an estimated uncertainty of @xmath63 ) to isolate the contribution of the feature below 2  kev . at higher energies , where the thermal contribution may be neglected",
    ", we used the sis spectrum .",
    "the spectral parameters from a power fit to this sis / rhri combined spectral data are included in table 3 . because of the exclusion of the diffuse component , the @xmath47 value is greater than those from the previous fits .",
    "the luminosity of the power law component is @xmath64 in the 2 - 7  kev band , or @xmath65 in the 0.2 - 4  kev band .",
    "the uncertainties of these luminosity estimates are @xmath66 .",
    "9 presents the power law model , together with the sis spectrum including data points below 2  kev .",
    "the residuals , evidently showing line features , do appear to be thermal in origin .",
    "a fit with a single temperature r&s model suggests a characteristic plasma temperature of @xmath67  kev .",
    "however , the fit ( @xmath68 ) is not satisfactory ; there is a significant excess above the model below 0.7  kev .",
    "a similar fit ( @xmath69 ) to the residuals in the pspc spectrum is good , and the best - fit temperature is @xmath70  kev .",
    "thus , the thermal model describes the residuals well only at the pspc s resolution .",
    "the predicted rhri count rate @xmath71 is consistent with the rate of the diffuse component within an estimated systematic error of up to @xmath72 .",
    "the above isolation of the power law component is physically plausible , but not unique .",
    "alternatively , the power law component might arise only in the compact x - ray source .",
    "a power law fit to this combination ( table 3 ) , however , is not as satisfactory .",
    "in particular , the absorption appears much too large ( by a factor of @xmath73 ) to be consistent with the measurement of the optical extinction toward n157b (  4.4 ) .",
    "the striking similarity between the spectra of n157b and snr 0540 - 69.3 , together with the centrally - peaked morphology of n157b in both radio and x - ray , leaves little doubt about n157b as a crab - like snr .",
    "in contrast to the highly polarized emission observed in the crab and snr 0540 - 69.3 , however , no radio polarization has been detected in n157b ( d94 ) .",
    "the comet - shaped x - ray feature is evidently the most interesting emission component of n157b .",
    "markwardt & gelman ( 1995 ) have observed a morphologically similar feature near the vela pulsar .",
    "they interpret this feature as the thermal emission from a cocoon around a jet from the pulsar .",
    "the pulsar s proper motion is found to be nearly perpendicular to the direction of the jet .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the jet is sweeping up the ambient material , which may explain the apparent higher density in the cocoon than in the ambient medium .",
    "however , the x - ray luminosity of the n157b feature is more than three orders of magnitude greater than that ( @xmath74 ) of the vela jet .",
    "furthermore , the _ asca _ spectrum shows that the emission , most of which arises in the comet - shaped feature , is predominantly nonthermal in origin (  3.3 ) .",
    "the diffuse emission component of n157b most likely arises in a diffuse plasma , which is responsible for the possible weak line features in the spectrum .",
    "we adopt a conversion of an rhri count rate to an emission integral ( ei  defined as @xmath75 ) as @xmath76 .",
    "this conversion applies to the model of @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and is good within a factor of 2 as long as the temperature @xmath79  kev . from table 2",
    ", we infer a count rate of the diffuse component as @xmath80 , corresponding to an ei of @xmath81 and an x - ray luminosity as @xmath82 in 0.1 - 2.4  kev band , or @xmath83 in the 0.5 - 2  kev band . further assuming that the diffuse component arises in an approximately spherical space of diameter @xmath84  pc , and using @xmath85 as the effective spatial filling factor",
    ", we estimate the gas density @xmath86 as @xmath87 . the corresponding total gas mass is then @xmath88 .",
    "if @xmath89 , the remnant expansion should then be in the sedov phase ( e.g. , cox 1972 ) .",
    "the total thermal energy in the x - ray - emitting plasma is @xmath90 , a considerable fraction of the expected mechanical energy of an sn .",
    "because this fraction is expected to be @xmath91 in the sedov phase , the inferred sn energy is in a nominal range of a few times @xmath92 . finally , the sedov age of the remnant is @xmath93  yrs , where @xmath94 is the remnant diameter in units of 20  pc and @xmath95 the diffuse plasma temperature in units of 0.7  kev .",
    "both the above x - ray size and boundary agree with those inferred from kinematic studies of h@xmath36-emitting gas in n157b ( e.g. , cksl92 ) .",
    "these studies have revealed shocked materials with velocity offsets up to @xmath96 .",
    "however , since the velocity of h@xmath36-emitting gas does not necessarily represent the expansion of the outer shock of the n157b remnant , the inferred characteristic age can , at most , be considered as an upper limit to the true age of the remnant .",
    "the predominant non - thermal nature of n157b leads us to explain the comet - shaped x - ray feature as a synchrotron nebula , powered by the putative pulsar embedded in n157b .",
    "this explanation , constrained by the observations , provides specific predictions about the energetics and dynamics as well as the spatial and spectral properties of the remnant .    from the luminosity of the x - ray feature , @xmath65 in the 0.2 - 4  kev band (  3.3 )",
    ", we may estimate the spin - down power @xmath97 of the pulsar .",
    "a linear relation @xmath98 , obtained by seward & wang ( 1988 ) , fits reasonably well to the three confirmed crab - like snrs . applying this relation to n157b",
    ", we obtain @xmath99 . following seward & wang ( 1988 ) again",
    ", we further estimate the period and magnetic field strength of the pulsar as @xmath100 and @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the remnant s age in units of @xmath103  yrs .",
    "the steep x - ray spectrum provides clues about the energy losing mechanism of relativistic particles in the synchrotron nebula .",
    "the x - ray - emitting lifetime @xmath104 of an electron in the nebula can be expressed as @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the characteristic synchrotron photon energy in units of kev , and @xmath107 is the magnetic field in units of @xmath108  g. this timescale is much shorter than the expected age of the remnant .",
    "therefore , a steady pulsar spin - down luminosity is a good approximation to model the current x - ray emission from the nebula .",
    "we assume that the distribution of pulsar injected particles is approximately a power law with an index of @xmath109 , and that the velocity distribution is isotropic .",
    "the x - ray emission spectrum is then a power law with @xmath110 if synchrotron radiation loss dominates , or @xmath111 if the energy loss is predominately due to adiabatic expansion of pulsar wind materials ( e.g. , tucker 1977 ) .",
    "in general , one expects a convex - shaped spectrum : the adiabatic loss dominates at low energies , whereas the synchrotron becomes important at high energies .",
    "such a slope change from high to low energies is a general characteristic of crab - like snrs ( e.g. , du plessis et al .",
    "the steep spectrum observed in n157b thus suggests that the synchrotron loss dominates in n157b even in the relatively low energy range 0.5 - 7  kev . from the slope of @xmath1 (  3.3 ) , we obtain @xmath112 .",
    "the spatial properties of the comet - shaped x - ray feature have implications for the dynamics of relativistic electrons .",
    "because of the short lifetime of the electrons , the size of a synchrotron nebula should typically be much smaller than that of the corresponding radio one if electrons diffuse through the nebula medium at the alfvn velocity .",
    "the observed size and comet - like shape of the x - ray feature suggest that x - ray - emitting particles are undergoing an outflow , which can travel much faster than diffusing electrons .",
    "the compact source , where energy is likely being deposited by the pulsar , is separated from the radio peak (  4.4 ) , where most of the pulsar spin - down energy has supposedly been dumped .",
    "if the _ birth _ place of the pulsar is close to the position of the radio peak and has an age of @xmath113 (  4.2 ) , the separation of @xmath114 between the pulsar and the radio peak then implies that the pulsar has a transverse velocity of @xmath115 , compared to an average pulsar velocity of @xmath116 ( lyne & lorimer 1994 ) .",
    "we use @xmath117 ( in units of @xmath118 ) to characterize the total velocity of the pulsar motion .",
    "such a relatively fast moving young pulsar can produce a strongly elongated pulsar wind bubble ( fig .",
    "this bubble consists of several distinct regions .",
    "first , one may expect a bow shock running ahead of the pulsar , while the corresponding reverse shock terminates the free pulsar wind .",
    "the size of the region enclosed by this bow shock can be small , but the pressure can be large , depending on the ram pressure .",
    "enhanced synchrotron radiation can then make the region especially bright in x - ray .",
    "second , accelerated by the pressure gradient between the bow shock and the ambient medium , the shocked wind materials , which are relativistically hot , naturally forms a supersonic jet inside a tunnel in the opposite direction of the pulsar s motion ( wang , li , & begelman 1993 ) .",
    "third , the jet likely shoots through the bubble , and then induces another bow shock ( or a series of oblique shocks ) on the other side .",
    "fourth , the terminated wind materials are forced back to the bubble , where most of the pulsar spin - down luminosity is dumped .",
    "let us now examine this picture in a more quantitative way .",
    "the size of the bow shock region around the pulsar should be consistent with the observed upper limit .",
    "the characteristic reverse shock radius @xmath119 is defined by the ram - pressure balance between the pulsar wind and the pulsar motion , @xmath120^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath121 is the spin - down luminosity in units of @xmath122 and @xmath123 is the ambient medium density , which may be of the same order of magnitude as @xmath86 estimated in the diffuse x - ray emission (  4.2 ) .",
    "the size and shape of the outer bow shock depend critically on the dynamical effect of magnetic fields , and no theoretical model has yet been developed to describe this phenomenon .",
    "we thus characterize the total volume of the region enclosed by the bow shock as @xmath124 , where the parameter @xmath125 is to be constrained . assuming that the energy is partitioned equally between particles and magnetic fields , that the field is randomly distributed , and that the pressure is balanced in the region , we have @xmath126 and @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the total energy in particles . since only about half of the observed x - rays from the feature originates in the compact x - ray source ( table  2 ) , the time spent by the shocked pulsar wind materials in the bow shock region is probably comparable to the lifetime of an electron that emits 1  kev photons .",
    "for a steady jet , we expect @xmath129 from ( 1)-(5 ) , we obtain @xmath130 the bow shock has a size @xmath131 , consistent with the upper limit to the full size of the compact x - ray source ( @xmath132 ; table 2 ) .    after being forced out from the bow shock , the wind materials can continue to radiate in x - ray ( fig .",
    "the radiation from the relativistic jet itself ( wang , li , & begelman 1993 ) , however , may not be significant .",
    "most of the x - rays from the comet - shaped feature outside the compact x - ray source are probably released after the jet is terminated and are from shocked wind materials inside the bubble , explaining why the width of the x - ray feature ( table 2 ) is comparable to that of the compact radio emission region (  4.4 ) .",
    "just like particles in the bow shock region , the shock materials in the wind bubble are still relativistically hot , and the emission is primarily synchrotron .",
    "we speculate that the lack of polarization in the observed radio emission of n157b is due to the presence of a giant region produced by the coexisting ob association lh99 ( schild & testor 1992 ) .",
    "cksl92 find that about 20% of the radio emission arises in the region , to be consistent with both the h@xmath36-to - radio continuum ratio and the average extinction ( @xmath133  mag ) , inferred from balmer decrement measurements over a 49 region surrounding n157b ( caplan & deharveng 1985 ) .",
    "the rest of the radio emission is presumably nonthermal ; part of the emission should be associated with the synchrotron nebula of the n157b remnant . the radio emission above the level of @xmath134 in fig .",
    "3d has an extent similar to the x - ray feature , but the centroid of the emission feature is about 12@xmath135 away from the compact x - ray source .",
    "based on the relations @xmath136 and @xmath137 , which are appropriate for the interstellar gas in the 30 dor region ( fitzpatrick 1986 ) , we infer @xmath138 . in comparison ,",
    "our x - ray - measured @xmath47 is @xmath139 (  3.3 ) .",
    "thus the n157b remnant is likely located in or behind the region .    the ionized gas and",
    "the expected magnetic field of the region can cause faraday rotation in the radiation from the synchrotron nebula .",
    "assuming that the 20% of the observed radio emission arises in a spherical region of @xmath140  pc diameter , similar to the projected dimension , we estimate a mean free electron density @xmath141 .",
    "the faraday rotation angle varies with @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the line - of - sight intensity of the field .",
    "following burn ( 1966 ) , we express the dispersion of the rotation within a radio survey beam as @xmath144 d_s / d_e,\\ ] ] where the coefficient @xmath145 , @xmath146 is the characteristic size of turbulent eddies , @xmath147  pc and @xmath148  cm are the beam size and the wavelength of the 2.3  ghz survey . in the bracket of the above equation is the faraday rotation angle through a single eddy . assuming a typical interstellar field of @xmath149 g",
    ", we obtain @xmath150 .",
    "this dispersion produces a radiation depolarization @xmath151,\\ ] ] where @xmath146 should be comparable to , or smaller than , the dimension @xmath152 of the region .",
    "therefore , only if a fraction of the observed region is in front of the nebula can the faraday dispersion explain the lack of the polarized emission in the 2.3  ghz survey . clearly , a radio survey at a higher frequency will have a better chance to detect the polarized emission from the synchrotron nebula .",
    "based on the and  observations , we have examined the x - ray timing , spatial , and spectral properties of n157b . an algorithm has been devised for extracting  spectra for a point - like x - ray source . for comparison",
    ", we have also presented an  spectrum of snr 0540 - 69.3 , the only lmc snr that contains a detected pulsar .",
    "we have arrived the following main results and conclusions .    1 .",
    "the flat and featureless spectrum of n157b in the @xmath6  kev range resembles that of snr 0540 - 69.3 , and is distinctly different from those of young shell - like snrs in the lmc .",
    "the power law energy slope ( @xmath1 ) of the spectrum is , however , steeper than those ( @xmath3 ) of snr 0540 - 69.3 , msh 15 - 52 , and the crab nebula .",
    "2 .   the spectrum of n157b shows possible line features at energies @xmath153  kev .",
    "a joint analysis of the and data suggests that these features are likely associated with a thermal emission component of the remnant .",
    "no pulsed signal is identified ; the pulsed fraction is @xmath154 of the remnant s total luminosity in the 0.5 - 2  kev band , or @xmath5 in the 2 - 10  kev band .",
    "so the putative pulsar in n157b is still elusive .",
    "more than two thirds of the observed x - ray radiation from n157b comes from a comet - shaped x - ray feature , which has a size of @xmath155 and a luminosity of @xmath156 in the 2 - 7  kev range .",
    "we interpret the x - ray feature as the synchrotron radiation from pulsar wind materials .",
    "the pulsar is likely moving at a speed of @xmath7 .",
    "a ram - pressure confined bow shock around the pulsar may account for an embedded compact x - ray source , which is probably unresolved .",
    "the ram pressure further focuses fresh wind materials into a relativistic jet . the jet is eventually terminated on the other side of the pulsar wind bubble , where most of the spin - down energy has been dumped .",
    "6 .   around the x - ray feature ,",
    "we further detect a low surface brightness diffuse x - ray emission region .",
    "this region most likely accounts for the apparent thermal component in the and spectra below @xmath2  kev .",
    "the remnant has a diameter of @xmath0  pc and a 0.5 - 2  kev luminosity of @xmath157 , a total thermal energy of @xmath158  ergs , and an age of @xmath8  yrs .",
    "7 .   the lack of polarized radio emission from n157b may be explained by the depolarization of a foreground region .",
    "we thank j. dickel for the radio map , c. smith for the h@xmath36 image used in the paper , and g. testor for sending us his optical ccd images of the n157b region .",
    "we thank the referees for various critical comments that led to improvements in the paper .",
    "this work is funded by a lindheimer fellowship and by nasa grant nag5 - 2717 .",
    "estimating a local background spectrum and subtracting it from an on - source x - ray spectrum normally represents a crucial step in analyzing the spectral properties of a source . because of the broad point spread function ( psf ) ( see  2.1 ) , it is not usually practical to obtain an independent measurement of the background free of source contamination without going far from the source , where data might not exist , or the background might differ significantly . for example , an annular background region of radius 3@xmath159 - 5@xmath159 would require that the source count rate be less than @xmath160 counts per second for it not to contribute more than 10% to the total counts in the background region .",
    "this count rate is barely detectable in a typical 20 ks observation . for an observation of a moderately bright point source ,",
    "the counts in the background are an admixture of source and background counts . on the other extreme , a source of a few count per sec would dominate the background region , contributing @xmath161 , and the background can be ignored to first - order .",
    "we are interested here in the intermediate case .",
    "the measured background includes x - rays of cosmic origin , x - rays and particles of solar origin , cosmic ray induced x - rays , and internal instrumental counts .",
    "perhaps most insidious for is the stray light x - rays ( mirror rays which undergoes single , instead of double reflections , etc . ) , which are not imaged in the usual way , and which depends strongly on the celestial distribution of x - ray emission in and out ( @xmath162 ) of the telescope s field of view .",
    "the background depends on the satellite geographical location and height above the earth , solar activity , and the incident cosmic x - rays as well as telescope pointing angle relative to the earth , sun , and earth s magnetic field vector .",
    "taken together , these produce a background for a given observation whose spectrum and intensity depends on date , orbit , sky , and detector coordinates .",
    "the broad psf wings also mean that other sources in the field may substantially color the target spectra , producing an additional effective background .",
    "the current recommended practice for estimating the background is to extract counts from the deep field pointings , screened in a manner identical to the data , and selected from the source detector region .",
    "for the simple case of an isolated point source , using the deep fields should give a reasonable zero - th order estimation of the background .",
    "however , for a given observation and target , this practice is limited by the uniqueness of background as discussed above . as an added complication , although these fields might represent the background statistically in an average field , they are known to contain explicit point sources , which may compromise extracted spectra near their detector locations .",
    "furthermore , the response of the detector to the background changes over the course of the mission due to known secular degradation of the instruments with time .",
    "most importantly , the background intensity and spectrum can vary from one field to another , especially in regions of nearby galaxies such as the lmc .    here",
    ", we present a simple method for a first - order estimate of both the source spectrum and the background spectrum from the data itself , for the case of an isolated point source embedded in a statistically uniform local background . the advantage of self - calibrating is evident given the strong temporal , instrumental , orbital , and celestial dependence of the background .",
    "our method is to consider the spectral ratio of observed and expected counts in concentric annuli centered on the source , each of which is an admixture of the true source and background spectrum .",
    "we look for deviations of the radial average profile from that expected for a point source and simultaneously solve for the two spatially distinct spectral components .",
    "thus we can estimate the background over the source region itself .",
    "this is in effect a form of spectro - spatial deconvolution of the background and source spectra .",
    "consider the observed counts in two concentric regions centered on the source and in the measured spectral bin ( `` pha '' bin ) @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 , both of which are a composition of the source and background spectra , @xmath166 and @xmath167 respectively ,        where @xmath170 are the geometric areas of the respective regions ; @xmath171 is the mean vignetting of the background region relative to the source ; @xmath172 and @xmath173 are the encircled energy function . ]",
    "v(eefs ) within those areas . here",
    ", the energy , @xmath174 , refers to the energy dependence of @xmath175 and @xmath171 , which also depend on specific locations of @xmath176 and @xmath177 in detector coordinates .",
    "these dependencies have been modeled with laboratory and on - orbit calibrations ( see  a1.3 , below ) and therefore , the ratios @xmath178 , and @xmath179 , are determined .",
    "notice that these ratio is not strongly energy dependent below @xmath180 kev , and for most cases , to the limit of our approximation , a single number for each is reasonable .",
    "we can then solve for the source and background spectra , and find , @xmath181 @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the total counts enclosed in the source area @xmath176 in spectral bin @xmath163 , and @xmath184 is the background spectra over the same area at that energy .",
    "the coefficients of @xmath166 and @xmath167 insure correct normalization and units .",
    "the resulting errors for the source and background are simply found from the quadratic sum of the errors associated with individual terms .    in practice , we carry out this calculation on each pha ( pi ) bin in our spectral file . the energy dependencies ( @xmath174 ) and ( @xmath163 ) are related by the spectral redistribution file , rmf(@xmath174;@xmath163 ) , and do not enjoy a one - to - one correspondence . however , our method is insensitive to this redistribution , as it is a third - order effect because it arises in the errors in the ratios @xmath109 and @xmath185 , which come from the fraction of redistributed counts at the lower energies .",
    "the typical negative sloped spectra and the weak energy dependence of these ratios insure that this effect is negligible for our purpose .    for simplicity , we assume the ratios @xmath109 and @xmath185 are energy independent",
    ". we can then easily compute the source and background spectral components using the ftool mathpha to perform the calculation on each element of the spectral ( `` pha '' ) file .",
    "we are then left with a spectral file which can be imported directly into a spectral analysis package such as xspec .",
    "these spectra will be correctly normalized and the instrument and mirror response files ( `` rmf '' + `` arf '' ) created for @xmath186(@xmath163 ) are still appropriate .",
    "it is most practical to use the observed source spectra @xmath186(@xmath163 ) along with the derived background spectra @xmath187(@xmath163 ) in analyzing the source spectra .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath175 and @xmath171 can be explicitly accounted for by using the awaki s `` xrtea '' effective area subroutine which returns @xmath175 and @xmath171 as a function of source position in a detector and off - source angle .",
    "this code is available in the ftools software package .",
    "an attractive alternative for measuring the eef is to use an observation of a bright point - like source .",
    "if this fiducial source is acquired at the same detector position ( i.e. 1 ccd mode default ) as the source under study , and the data screened and exposure - corrected in the same way , then the background for the fiducial source relative to the study source may be reasonably ignored .",
    "modeling the eef with a real observation allows for the jitter in the attitude , which is similar from observation to observation ( order @xmath188 ) . for the sis ,",
    "the fiducial source should not be too bright as to be noticeably affected by pile - up .",
    "the bright cvs make excellent targets , and have been successfully used for this purpose .    in conclusion ,",
    "the above method allows an estimate of the background spectrum under a circular aperture , centered on a point - like source .",
    "given enough counts , this method can naturally extend to a least square solution for a general spectro - spatial deconvolution for a point source .",
