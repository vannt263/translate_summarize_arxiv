    "the central and complex role of galactic gas in the star formation , dynamical , and chemical evolution of galaxies is well established .",
    "evidence is mounting that , at the present epoch , multiphase gaseous halos are a physical extension of their host galaxy s interstellar medium ( ism ) ; their physical extent , spatial distribution , ionization conditions , and chemical enrichment are intimately linked to the energy density rate infused into the galaxy s ism by stellar winds and ionizing radiation , and by supernovae shock waves ( e.g.@xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "one long  standing question is how the halos and ism of earlier epoch galaxies compare or relate , in an evolutionary sense , to those of the present epoch .",
    "normal ( @xmath10 ) galaxies at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath11 ) are seen to give rise to low ionization mg0.1emii  @xmath2 absorption with @xmath12   out to projected distances of @xmath13  kpc ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "a key question is whether low ionization gas at large galactocentric distances is due to infall ( i.e.  satellite accretion , minor mergers , intragroup or intergalactic infall ) , or to energetic processes in the ism ( galactic fountains , chimneys ) . using high resolution profiles , churchill , steidel , & vogt ( 1996 ) found no suggestive trends between low ionization gas properties and galaxy properties at @xmath14 .",
    "a next logical step toward addressing this question is to explore the high ionization gas in absorption selected galaxies at these redshifts .",

    "ticks above the hires spectra give the velocities of the multiple vp sub  components and ticks above the fos data give the expected location of these components for both members of the doublet .",
    "the profiles are shown in order of increasing kinematic spread from the upper left to lower right .",
    "the kinematic spread is the second velocity moment of the apparent optical depth of the @xmath24 profile , given by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 $ ] , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the observed flux and the fitted continuum flux at velocity @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the zero  point velocity is given by the optical depth median of the @xmath24 profile .",
    "the kinematic spreads range from a few to @xmath30  .    in figure",

    "-0.1 in    -0.2 in    as seen in figure  [ fig : fig2]@xmath35 , @xmath32 correlates with @xmath36 .",
    "significant scatter arises because @xmath36 is sensitive to the line  of  sight chance presence and equivalent width distribution of the smaller @xmath37 , `` outlying velocity '' clouds ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the dlas define a `` saturation line '' ; profiles with @xmath38   along this line have saturated cores .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : fig2]@xmath39 , there is a tight correlation between @xmath36 and @xmath5 . a spearman  kendall test , incorporating limits ( @xcite ) , yielded a greater than 99.99% confidence level .",
    "a weighted least  squares fit to the data ( dotted line through the origin and with upper limits excluded ) yielded a slope of @xmath40   per @xmath41   of @xmath5 .",
    "the data exhibit a scatter of @xmath42   about the fit .",
    "an essentially identical maximum likelihood fit is shown as a dashed line .    over the interval @xmath43",
    ", there are four absorbers that lack the higher ionization phase typical for their kinematic spread ; they are `` deficient '' .",
    "these systems , q  0117 + 213 at @xmath44 , q  1317 + 277 at @xmath45 , q  0117 + 213 at @xmath46 , and q  1329 + 274 at @xmath47 ( in order of decreasing @xmath36 ) , lie @xmath48 , @xmath49 @xmath50 , and @xmath51 from the correlation line , respectively .",
    "as compared to other dlas with similar @xmath36 , the dla at @xmath52 in the field of q  @xmath17 ( 3c  336 ) also appears to have a slight deficiency .",
    "three important observational facts are : ( 1 ) the scatter in @xmath5 vs.  @xmath32 indicates that the strength of absorption is not driven by the strong `` central '' component that dominates @xmath32 , ( 2 ) @xmath53 is sensitive to the presence of small @xmath32 , outlying velocity clouds , and ( 3 ) the scatter of @xmath32 vs.  @xmath53 is large , whereas the scatter of @xmath5 vs.  @xmath53 about the correlation line is only @xmath54   .",
    "these facts imply that , independent of the overall line  of  sight kinematics , the existence and global dynamics of smaller , kinematic `` outliers '' are intimately linked to the presence and physical conditions of a higher ionization phase .",
    "it would appear that is governed by the same physical processes that give rise to kinematic outlying clouds .",
    "the absorption could arise due to the ionization balance in the clouds , ionization structure in the clouds , or due to multiphase structure . in most cases , multiphase structure is the likely explanation because the small @xmath32 , single phase , outlying velocity clouds with @xmath55   can not produce the large observed @xmath5 , as shown by churchill et  al .",
    "( 1999a ) [ also see churchill & charlton ( 1999 ) ] .",
    "if the clouds are accreted by infall and/or minor mergers , such that the energetics originated gravitationally ( e.g.@xcite ) , multiphase structure could arise from shock heating and/or merger induced star formation ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "if , on the other hand , the absorbing gas is mechanically produced by winds from massive stars , ob associations , or from galactic fountains and chimneys , a dynamic multiphase structure could arise from shock heated ascending material that forms a high ionization layer ( corona ) and supports a descending lower ionization layer , which then breaks into cool , infalling clouds [ see avillez ( 1999 ) , and references therein ] .",
    "both scenarios imply a link between galaxy star formation histories , in particular multiple episodes of elevated star formation [ but not necessarily bursting ( @xcite ) ] , and the presence of outlying velocity clouds and strong .",
    "infall models predict increasing cloud densities with decreasing galactocentric distance ( e.g.  @xcite ) , resulting in an ionization gradient ( clouds further out are more highly ionized ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig3]@xmath31 , we show @xmath6 vs.  impact parameter for 13 absorbing galaxies .",
    "there is no obvious evidence for an ionization gradient ( 95% confidence ) .",
    "however , @xmath6 could be sensitive to halo mass ( e.g. @xcite ) , to the presence of satellite galaxies ( @xcite ) , or to the sampling of discrete clouds over a range of galactocentric distances along the line of sight . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig3]@xmath35 , we show @xmath6 vs.  galaxy @xmath8 color for 11 galaxies .",
    "there is a suggested trend ( @xmath7 ) for red galaxies ( those dominated by late ",
    "type stellar populations ) to have small @xmath6 .",
    "if such a trend is confirmed in a larger data sample , it would not be incompatable with a dynamical multiphase scenario in which absorbing gas properties are linked to the host galaxy stellar populations , and therefore , star formation history .",
    "the tight correlation between kinematics and absorption may imply a self  regulating process involving both ionization conditions and kinematics in the halos of higher redshift , @xmath56 galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) , as explored by norman & ikeuchi ( 1989 ) and li & ikeuchi ( 1992 ) .",
    "perhaps outflow energetics from supernovae during periods of elevated star formation are balanced by the galactic gravitational potential well , resulting in a fairly narrow range of kinematic and multiphase ionization conditions .",
    "such a balance might set up a high ionization galactic  like `` corona '' ( @xcite ) in proportion to the kinematics of gravitationally bound , cooling material .",
    "all this would imply that galaxy `` coronae '' have been in place since @xmath57 , that their nature primarily depends upon the host galaxy s star formation history , and therefore morphology , environment , and stellar populations ( as seen locally , e.g.@xcite )",
    ". detailed observations of the stellar content and galactic morphologies and space  based uv high  resolution spectroscopy of high ionization absorption lines , would be central to establishing the interactive cycles between stars and gas in higher redshift galaxies .",
