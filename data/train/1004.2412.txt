    "the observed scaling relations between the structural properties of massive galaxies - such as their bulge mass , luminosity , and stellar velocity dispersion - and the mass of the supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) sitting at their centers suggest that the build - up of galaxies and the growth of black holes are closely related , which is often referred to as bh / galaxy co - evolution .",
    "since the bh growth is thought to happen primarily through efficient accretion phases accompanied by the release of kinetic and radiative energy , part of which can be deposited into the galaxy interstellar medium , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are believed to represent a key phase across a galaxy s lifetime .",
    "support for this hypothesis comes from several lines of evidence such as i ) the match between the mass function of smbhs grown through agn phases and the one observed in local galaxies @xcite ; ii ) the cosmological `` downsizing '' of both nuclear activity and star formation @xcite ; iii ) the detection of large quantities of gas outflowing from active nuclei ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "a number of semi - analytic models to explain the bh / galaxy co - evolution have been proposed over about the past decade @xcite .",
    "these models follow the evolution and growth of dark matter structures across cosmic time , either through the press - schechter formalism or through n - body simulations , and use analytic recipes to treat the baryon physics within the dark matter halos .",
    "a common assumption of these models is that mergers between gas - rich galaxies trigger nuclear activity and star formation .",
    "recently , a bh / galaxy evolutionary sequence associated to `` wet '' galaxy mergers has been proposed @xcite , in which an initial phase of vigorous star formation and obscured , possibly eddington limited , accretion is followed by a phase in which the nucleus first gets rid of the obscuring gas shining as an unobscured qso , then quenches star formation , and eventually fades , leaving a passively evolving galaxy .",
    "the various bh / galaxy co - evolution models have been successful in many respects , being able to explain the local bh / galaxy scaling relations , the local bh mass function , the qso luminosity function and clustering @xcite .",
    "further testing is however needed , given the large numbers of parameters involved in the modeling .",
    "a built - in feature of the bh / galaxy evolutionary sequence is that an obscured accretion phase preceeds a clean accretion phase , at least in powerful , qso - like objects .",
    "is it therefore reasonable to expect that the fraction of obscured agn was higher in the past ?",
    "this depends on many parameters such as i ) the physical scale of the absorbing gas and how it is driven towards the bh ; ii ) the relative timescales of the obscured and unobscured phases ; iii ) whether the absorbed - to - unabsorbed agn transition occurs also in low - mass / low - luminosity objects ( i.e. seyfert galaxies ) .",
    "not many theoretical predictions on the evolution of the obscured agn fraction are available in the literature .",
    "depending on the assumptions , some models predict an increase of the obscured agn fraction with redshift @xcite , some others do not @xcite .    from an observational point of view",
    "the situation is also debated .",
    "an increase of the obscured agn fraction with redshift among x - ray selected agn has been for instance observed by @xcite , but other works did not find any evidence of this trend @xcite .",
    "much of the uncertainty can be related to the lack of statistically large samples of agn with high - quality x - ray spectra . indeed , using small samples which can not be split into narrow luminosity and redshift bins",
    ", it is often complicated to disentangle any redshift - dependent from luminosity - dependent effects ( it is generally agreed that the obscured agn fraction decreases with luminosity , but the slope and normalization of this relation differ from paper to paper ) . furthermore , the absorption column density is often estimated either from the x - ray hardness ratio , or from the absence of broad emission lines in the optical spectrum .",
    "both methods suffer from caveats and limitations @xcite , and ideally the absorbing column should be measured through x - ray spectra with good photon statistics .",
    "erg  s@xmath0 as observed by @xcite ( hasinger 2008 , datapoints ) compared with the model expectations by @xcite ( gch07 , solid lines ) .",
    "the intrinsic fraction of obscured agn with @xmath1 erg  s@xmath0 , assumed to be constant with redshift in @xcite , is shown as an horizontal line .",

    "adapted from @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]    an attempt to measure the evolution with redshift of the obscured fraction of agn as a function of their x - ray luminosity has been recently done by hasinger @xcite , who compiled a sample of @xmath4 agn selected in the 2 - 10 kev band and split it into 8 luminosity bins . in fig",
    ".  1 ( _ left _ ) is shown the evolution of the obscured agn fraction at luminosities around @xmath5 erg  s@xmath0 as measured in @xcite . although some approximated correction has been performed ( see section 6.2 in @xcite ) , this is essentially an _ observed _ fraction which still suffers from selection biases against obscured objects : because of k - correction effects , this bias is less severe towards higher redshifts , when the photoelectric cut - off moves towards lower frequencies .",
    "we verified the strength of k - correction effects by considering the x - ray background ( xrb ) model by @xcite , which matches the obscured agn fraction at log@xmath6 , and in which this fraction is constant with redshift . by folding the logn - logs relations of obscured and unobscured agn with log@xmath6 with the sky coverage curve of @xcite we found the trend shown in fig .",
    "1 ( _ left _ ) : an _ intrinsic _ obscured fraction which is constant with redshift translates into an _ observed _ fraction which is increasing with redshift .",
    "thus , the trend at log@xmath6 found in @xcite might be mostly driven by k - correction effects rather than by a truly evolving obscured agn fraction .",
    "the same conclusion also holds at lower luminosities . a possible way to reconcile this result with the redshift evolution found in @xcite and @xcite , who take into account selection effects in their estimates but do not split their samples into narrow luminosity bins ,",
    "is to hypothesize that the obscured fraction increases with redshift * only * for very luminous qsos .",
    "indeed , the luminosity dependence of the obscured agn fraction in @xcite appears to be too shallow when compared with recent results @xcite , overestimating the number of obscured qsos with log@xmath7 : a too large number of local obscured qsos assumed in @xcite might mask any increase with redshift .",
    "the possibility of a stronger evolution of the obscured agn fraction for more luminous sources has , for instance , been proposed in the blast - wave semi - analytic model by @xcite .",
    "if the overall evolution of obscured agn is uncertain , the evolution of the most heavily obscured and elusive ones , the so - called compton - thick agn ( @xmath8@xmath9 ; hereafter ct agn ) , is completely unknown .",
    "only @xmath1050 _ bona - fide _ ct agn are known in the local universe @xcite , but their abundance has nonetheless been estimated to be comparable to that of less obscured ones @xcite . also , synthesis models of the xrb predict that from @xmath1010 to @xmath1030% of the xrb peak emission at 30 kev is due to the emission of ct agn integrated over all redshifts . in the absence of any information , the luminosity function and evolution of ct agn in xrb synthesis models",
    "have been usually assumed to be equal to those of less obscured ones .    in recent years",
    "there have been many attempts to constrain the space density of ct agn in different luminosity and redshift intervals exploiting different selection techniques . very hard",
    "( @xmath11 kev ) x - ray surveys are still limited in sensitivity and are just sampling the local universe @xcite . as a result , the population of local ct agn detected by integral and swift is producing only a tiny fraction ( @xmath12 ) of the xrb . to sample agn at higher redshifts , and in particular at @xmath13 , where the bulk of the `` missing '' xrb is thought to be produced",
    ", one needs to rely on deep x - ray surveys in the 2 - 10 kev band and try to select ct agn either directly from x - ray spectroscopy , or by comparing the measured , obscured x - ray emission ( if any ) with some other indicator of the intrinsic nuclear power : ir selection can track the nuclear emission as reprocessed by the dusty absorber ; high - ionization , narrow optical emission lines can sample scales free from the nuclear obscuration .",
    "x - ray stacking of ir - selected , but x - ray undetected , sources has been used to estimate the space density of ct agn at @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the comparison between the [ o  iii]5007 and x - ray flux has been used to select x - ray underluminous qsos and then estimate the density of ct qsos at @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "a summary of these and other measurements , compared with the predicted space densities of ct agn by @xcite , is shown in fig .  1 ( _ right _ ) .",
    "to sample the population of ct around @xmath13 , in @xcite we recently devised a selection method based on the [ ne  v]3426 emission line , which can be applied to optical spectroscopic surveys with deep x - ray coverage to search for ct objects at @xmath16 , i.e. at redshifts not reachable with [ o  iii]5007 selection .",
    "we calibrated an x - ray to [ ne  v ] flux diagnostic ratio ( x / nev ) based on a sample of @xmath17 local seyferts , verifying that objects with x / nev@xmath1815 are almost invariably compton - thick .",
    "we then applied this diagnostic to several samples of obscured and unobscured qsos : for the objects at @xmath19 presented in @xcite we found an excellent agreement between the absorption estimated from the x / oiii and the x / nev ratio . furthermore , despite the very low statistics , @xmath20 of the [ ne v]-selected type-2 qsos at @xmath16 appear to be good ct candidates .",
    "[ ne  v ] , [ o  iii ] , and ir selection are all indirect ways to select ct agn , since the ct nature of an object is inferred from the faintness of its x - ray emission relative to an indicator of the intrinsic power , and then suffer from a number of systematics like reddening in optically selected sources and non - simultaneous data acquisition . to sample",
    "_ bona fide _ ct agn over a broad redshift range and , in particular , at @xmath21 , very deep x - ray exposures are needed to collect photons and allow x - ray spectral analysis .",
    "this is indeed one of the goals of the deep xmm survey in the cdfs ( p.i .",
    "a. comastri ) .",
    "the exposure time , cleaned of background flares , currently amounts to @xmath22 ms and by the end of the program , foreseen by march 2010 , should reach @xmath23 ms .",
    "a number of ct candidates , identified in the 1 ms cdfs catalog on the bases of their flat ( low quality ) spectrum @xcite , are being confirmed as such by the higher quality xmm spectra ( comastri et al . in prep . ) , including the well - known ct candidate cdfs-202 at z=3.7 @xcite .",
    "further significant improvements are expected by the forthcoming ddt extension of the chandra cdfs exposure from 2 ms to 4 ms .",
    "current deep ( ms ) x - ray exposures are limited to very small areas ( @xmath24 deg@xmath25 ) , and do not allow construction of sizeable samples of distant , _ bona - fide _ ct agn .",
    "a number of x - ray missions are being developed or proposed for the near to mid - term future which should address this issue : nustar , astro - h ( approved by nasa and jaxa , respectively ) , exist and nhxm ( proposed to nasa and asi , respectively ; see these proceedings ) will primarily focus on the high - energy ( @xmath11 kev ) radiation , which is the least affected by absorption .",
    "their sensitivity is expected to be up to @xmath26 orders of magnitude better than current instrumentation .",
    "the redshift distribution of ct objects collected by these missions will peak at @xmath27 , and will allow population studies of ct objects at redshifts @xmath28 .",
    "the proposed international x - ray observatory ( ixo , @xcite ) , thanks to its large effective area ( 3  m@xmath25 at 1 kev ) has the potential to provide very high quality spectra for distant ct agn , but the small ( @xmath29 deg@xmath25 ) field of view ( fov ) might represent a limitation to collect large object samples .",
    "a mission which is certainly expected to allow population studies of distant ( up to @xmath30 ) ct agn , thus providing a measure of their cosmological evolution , is the proposed wide field x - ray telescope @xcite , which has a unique combination of wide fov ( 1 deg@xmath25 ) , large effective area ( 1  m@xmath25 at 1 kev ) , sharp angular resolution ( @xmath31 ) constant across the fov , and low instrumental background to provide deep x - ray surveys in the 0.5 - 7 kev band over large portions of the sky .",
    "the equivalent of @xmath102000 xbootes fields , @xmath32 c - cosmos fields and @xmath101000 2 ms cdfs fields is expected to be returned by wfxt over 5 years of operation . as an example of these surveys potential , based on the current design and observing strategy",
    ", the wfxt project is expected to return a sample of @xmath33 objects at @xmath34 which are _ bona fide _ ct agn , i.e. with more than 500 net counts in the 0.5 - 7 kev band100 _ bona - fide _ ct agn at @xmath34 to a sample as large as the wfxt one . ] ( the number of simple detections of ct agn will be obviously much larger ) . in fig .",
    "2 we show two such objects ( cdf-202 and cdfs-153 , another ct agn , at @xmath35 , found in the xmm - cdfs ) simulated using the wfxt response matrices for the goal design . it is evident that 500 x - ray photons are sufficient to unambiguously reveal their ct nature .",
    "furthermore , wfxt is expected to return a global sample of 300,000 agn in the redshift range @xmath36 with even larger photon statistics ( @xmath37 net counts ) , for which a robust measurement of the column density is possible . among the many applications ,",
    "such an object sample will definitely allow measurement of the evolution of obscured accretion as a function of agn luminosity .",
