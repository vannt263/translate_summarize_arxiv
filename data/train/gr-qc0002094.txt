    "compact binary systems of neutron stars and black holes inspiralling under gravitational radiation reaction are one of the most promising sources of gravitational waves for kilometre arm length interferometric gravitational wave detectors like the ligo and virgo .",
    "the inspiral phase is best described by a post - newtonian approximation which should eventually break down and the final merger and coalescence may be only accessible via numerical integration of einstein s equations . a major obstacle in the numerical studies of such systems is the non - availability of physically satisfactory initial data . given the constraints on computational resources",
    ", one would like to start the numerical integration as close as possible to the final coalescence phase , using the initial data obtained by matching on to the known analytical results of inspiral .",
    "one of the suggestions in this direction is to use the analytical post - newtonian results of inspiral to provide initial data ( e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) for the numerical integration of the fully general relativistic system .    before attempting to apply the above strategy to the complicated compact binary system , as a preliminary step",
    ", shinkai @xcite has constructed a single neutron star model using the post - newtonian approach and concluded that the truncated second order post - newtonian approximation is close enough to describe a general relativistic single star .",
    "the truncated post - newtonian series used above is essentially a taylor expansion in the three small parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the pressure , @xmath4 , the total energy density of the system , @xmath5 the radial coordinate , and @xmath6 the mass contained in a sphere of radial coordinate @xmath5 .",
    "we shall refer to the post - newtonian truncated models alternatively as _",
    "taylor models_. recently , in a related context of gravitational wave phasing , the slow convergence of straightforward taylor approximants has been critically investigated@xcite@xcite .",
    "it was shown that new approximants , with much improved convergence properties , may be constructed for gravitational wave data analysis applications using , as an important tool , pad techniques to estimate the relevant functions from only the first few terms in their perturbative post - newtonian expansion .",
    "this approach has been systematically extended in a series of publications @xcite@xcite and most recently has been used to go beyond the adiabatic approximation to inspiral and provide an analysis of the transition from the inspiral to the plunge in binary black hole coalescences @xcite .",
    "this work also provides for the first time initial dynamical data ( positions and momenta ) for binary black holes starting to plunge , so that there is less than an orbit left to evolve . in view of this experience , in this report",
    ", we construct pad approximants to the truncated post - newtonian ( taylor ) neutron star models discussed by shinkai @xcite and investigate their performance .",
    "we show that the pad models are better than the truncated post - newtonian models and converge faster to the exact general relativistic solution .",
    "further , we also show that the evolution of a general relativistic ( single ) star is described much better by pad initial data as compared to the truncated taylor initial data of the same order .    in the next section",
    "we discuss the tov equation and the truncated post - newtonian models . in section iii",
    "we introduce the standard pad approximant , discuss its applicability to the present problem , and adapt it to construct an appropriate generalisation for the case of 3-small parameters .",
    "pad models corresponding to the ` taylor ' truncated models are constructed . in the last section",
    "we discuss the results and summarise our conclusions .",
    "the appendix lists the more involved formulas for the 3pn pad models .",
    "in general relativity the metric of a spherically symmetric static star can be written as @xmath7 and the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium - the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations - obtained ( in geometrised units : @xmath8 ) from the einstein field equations , for a given fluid distribution specified by an adiabatic equation of state @xmath9 , are given by : @xmath10 @xmath11 is given in terms of metric component @xmath12 as @xmath13 the above set of equations are integrated from the center ( @xmath14 ) to the boundary of the star , with the initial conditions @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 is rescaled appropriately such that it matches with the exterior schwarzschild solution at the boundary .",
    "the radius of the star , @xmath18 , is characterised as the radius where density @xmath19 drops to @xmath20 gm / cc ( approximately @xmath21 in geometrised units ) .",
    "schematically , equations ( [ eq : dpr ] ) and ( [ eq : dnr ] ) can be written as @xmath22 assuming that @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are of comparable orders of smallness and making a taylor series expansion in @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 around the origin , the above equations to third post - newtonian order then yield , @xmath26 where the post - newtonian order of the relevant terms is indicated by the pn label under the braces .",
    "these equations describe the truncated post - newtonian model @xcite . before proceeding ahead",
    ", we must verify that the above truncation is consistent and meaningful in the present problem of neutron stars . for a range of models ,",
    "we evaluate the successive combinations that appear in eqs .",

    "a convenient choice of pad approximants is its diagonal ( or nearly diagonal ) continued fraction form @xcite i.e. , @xmath36 when @xmath37 ( even ) and @xmath38 when @xmath39 ( odd ) .",
    "for instance , @xmath40 where the @xmath41 s are determined in terms of the taylor coefficients @xmath42 by    @xmath43    to construct the pad approximant of the truncated post - newtonian models discussed in the previous section , we must proceed carefully . in the problem under discussion , in general , there are three independent small parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , of the same order of smallness . given this system of approximate differential equations containing three independent small parameters , can we construct an associated pad like approximation with faster and improved convergence ?",
    "assume for a moment , that since @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 are of the same order of smallness , we decide to use as the variable of expansion the parameter @xmath24 that takes the maximum value in the entire range of integration .",
    "the first order taylor term @xmath44 would be rewritten as @xmath45 . if we treat only @xmath24 as the independent variable then its associated coefficient would be @xmath46 . if @xmath47 and @xmath48 have only a weak dependence on @xmath5 , we can indeed use a simpler pad form with only one variable and this should suffice .",
    "we call this the one parameter pad form for the tov equations . in this case , the relevant equations at 2pn are the following : , @xmath24 or @xmath25 as the expansion parameter .",
    "it is also equivalent to introducing by hand a small parameter say @xmath49 in terms of which we ( taylor or pad ) expand , treating as coefficients the associated @xmath50 dependence . ]",
    "@xmath51    ( the more involved equations and the corresponding 3pn forms in the appendix are exibited for analytical completeness . in our numerical computation",
    "however , we directly substitute eqs .",

    "the results are displayed in figure  [ fig : r2 ] . from the figure it is clear , that as required , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 are approximately of the same order of smallness . however",
    ", if one looks at the ratio of @xmath48 , one finds that there is a regime where the @xmath5-dependence is not very weak .",
    "consequently , we are wary of using only the usual straightforward one parameter pad form discussed above and proceed as follows .",
    "we generalise the usual construction for the one parameter pad to the situation where there exist , not one , but three small parameters .",
    "the advantage of using a three parameter form is that its ` coefficients ' are pure numbers with no explicit ` @xmath5-dependence ' . by treating @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 as independent variables ,",
    "we avoid the explicit issue of the ` weak @xmath5-dependence ' of the associated coefficients . ,",

    "the 3pn three parameter pad model may be similarly obtained but since the expressions are lengthier , we list them in the appendix together with the one parameter 3pn pad model .",
    "we consider the polytropic equation of state @xmath81 choosing the same models as studied by shinkai @xcite i.e. , @xmath82 and @xmath83 with @xmath84 ( the polytropic constant ) @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively . before presenting the final results , we have compared the performance of the one parameter pad models with three parameter pad models and display in figure  [ fig : r3 ] a typical comparison . from the figure it is clear that both models yield similar numerical performance and the difference",
    ", if any , appears in the region where anyway these models are not recommended .",
    "consequently , all our figures refer to the one parameter pad models though we have verified that the three parameter pad models also yield similar results .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] , we plot mass ( in solar mass units ) as a function of central density .",
    "the different curves represent the exact tov , the 2pn and 3pn truncated ( taylor ) models ( henceforth 2-taylor , 3-taylor etc ; for more details , see @xcite ) and our new pad approximated models . we do not plot curves corresponding to 1pn truncated taylor and the associated first order pad model as they are very far away from the exact gr curve and thus evidently inadequate .",
    "it is very clear from the figure that for all models to the left of the ( first ) maximum , which represents the stable branch of the mass - density curve , the pad models do extremely well as compared to taylor models . in this regime",
    "the third order pad ( now onwards 3-pad ) curve ( dashed line ) is very close to the exact gr curve ( solid line ) .",
    "the 2-pad ( long - dashed line ) curve is not only better compared to the 2-taylor one ( dot - dashed ) but even far better than the 3-taylor curve ( dotted line ) . in the unstable branch i.e. , to the right to the maximum , the pad approximation starts becoming bad .",
    "this feature is more severe when the stiffness of the considered equation of state and the order of the pad approximants are higher ) for the models which fall in the unstable branch , we notice that the values for the 1pn terms become even greater than one , indicating that neither the taylor truncation nor the pad expansion is reliable in this region . for the stable branch models these coefficients",
    "are always lesser than one as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : r1 ] . ]",
    "[ fig : f1]b and c ) .",
    "however , the stable branch is approximated well by pad models even for a very stiff equation of state ( @xmath87 , fig .  [",
    "fig : f1]c ) , where the approximation breaks down near ( @xmath88 x @xmath89 g/@xmath90 ) the maximum mass limit ( @xmath91 x @xmath89 g/@xmath90 ) . studies of mass - radius curves and @xmath17 ( the exponent of the metric component @xmath92 at the center of the star ) _ vs _ central density curves also show a similar dependence on the stiffness of the chosen equation of state and on the central density . in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : f3 ] , we plot mass _ vs _ radius and @xmath17 _ vs _ central density curves respectively , for an equation of state with intermediate stiffness @xmath93 .",
    "the deviation of the 3-pad solutions from the exact gr ones correspond to the configurations lying on the unstable branch .",
    "the studies of these equilibrium configurations imply clearly that the stable general relativistic tov configurations are approximated very well by pad models as compared to taylor truncated models , even if they do not perform so well in the unstable branch . to study this further , we next numerically evolve these five initial configurations - exact tov , 2-pad , 3-pad , 2-taylor and 3-taylor truncated models - in time and qualitatively compare their evolution .",
    "we use a spherically symmetric general relativistic hydrodynamical code for this purpose @xcite .",
    "the code uses polar slicing and radial gauge .",
    "the spacetime is evolved using the adm formalism and the hydrodynamic evolution is based on a high resolution shock capturing @xcite-@xcite scheme .",
    "the grid boundary is fixed at about four times the radius of the tov model .",
    "we choose a model with central density @xmath94 x @xmath95 ( geometrised units ) , @xmath96 and then evolve it upto 10 ms ( though the code runs for a much longer time , 10 ms evolution is sufficient for our analysis ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : f4 ] the evolution of central density using various initial data is displayed .",
    "we find that the 3-pad curve follows the tov evolution curve very closely .",
    "even the 2-pad evolution is much better than the 3-taylor and the 2-taylor evolutions .",
    "the oscillations in the central density are due to the numerical truncation errors which introduce non - zero radial velocity .",
    "these truncation errors act as the small perturbations on a stable spherically symmetric configuration and give rise to the radial pulsation modes of the system .",
    "a fourier transform of the density or radial velocity evolution can be used to extract these pulsation modes @xcite and we hope to return to this in a subsequent work . in fig .",
    "[ fig : f5 ] we plot the metric components @xmath92 and @xmath97 over the grid for @xmath98 ( initial time ) and @xmath99ms ( final time ) . to compare the global performance of the initial data used ( the exact tov and the various truncated models ) ,",
    "the norms of the hamiltonian constraints @xmath100 ( maximum value at a given time step ) and @xmath101 ( average of the absolute value ) are evaluated and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f6 ] . these figures ,",
    "once again , confirm the superior performance of pad approximants over taylor approximants of the same order .",
    "though we do not display them , we get similar results for the other stable configurations both for relatively softer and stiffer equations of state",
    ". a final comment on the models in the unstable branch of the mass - density curve : the truncation errors are enough to trigger a collapse and make the system unstable on a time scale so short that a comparison of various approximations is not possible . a more detailed analysis would be needed in this regard .    to conclude : detailed studies of equilibrium configurations of single neutron stars and their evolution indicate , that in the stable branch , the second order pad model converges to the exact general relativistic model even better than the straightforward third order truncated ( taylor ) pn model .",
    "both the simpler one parameter pad form and a more involved three parameter pad form exhibit similar improvement over the taylor models .",
    "the pad models are thus quite robust and controlled and perform better than the simpler taylor truncated models .",
    "it is better to use initial data obtained from a pad approximant to the taylor model than initial data from a straightforward post - newtonian truncated model of the same order .",
    "this feature should be generic and extend to binary neutron stars and black holes [ especially since a useful simplification in a two - body problem is via a reduction to an equivalent one - body problem ] and prove useful in numerical studies of such systems in the future .",
