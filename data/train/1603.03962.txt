    "the quantum dynamics of many physical systems involves multiparticle continuua .",
    "examples range from ionization and high harmonic generation in multielectron atoms to molecular processes such as photodissociation and chemical reactions of polyatomics .",
    "the large hilbert space of these systems makes full simulations extremely challenging .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to find a compact representation for quantum dynamics in the continuum where accuracy can be easily controlled .",
    "an attractive option is to represent states as phase space objects , so that only those areas of phase space that are actually occupied are needed for the calculation .",
    "the most commonly used phase space representation , the wigner representation , has proven to be expensive computationally , although there has been some recent progress @xcite .",
    "an alternative is the husimi representation , although this too is awkward for direct numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "a third option for a phase space representation is the von neumann lattice @xcite .",
    "this representation consists of a discrete lattice of phase space gaussians , one per each cell of area @xmath0 where @xmath1 is planck s constant and @xmath2 is the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "initial work using this representation found it to be poorly convergent @xcite .",
    "about ten years ago , poirier and coworkers @xcite found a way to converge the method and have applied it recently to several challenging applications @xcite .",
    "independently , a few years later , our group discovered a different way to converge the von neumann lattice , based on modifying the gaussians to be periodic and band - limited @xcite .",
    "we named the method pvn , _ periodic von neumann_. the pvn basis is guaranteed to have exactly the same accuracy as a discrete fourier representation @xcite , while having the flexibility of a gaussian basis set .",
    "since the pvn basis is non - orthogonal , a key aspect of the mathematical formulation involves the concept of biorthogonal bases .",
    "we define the biorthogonal von neumann ( bvn ) basis as the basis biorthogonal to pvn . since a crucial part of our method is to exchange the roles of the pvn and bvn bases we refer to the method more generally as periodic von neumann with biorthogonal exchange or pvb . in this work",
    "we further develop the mathematical underpinnings of the pvb method .",
    "in particular , we derive new relations for the reduced hilbert space associated with non - orthogonal bases when projecting down from the full hilbert space .",
    "furthermore , we analyze the possible forms of the schrdinger equation in the reduced basis .",
    "these developments become crucial when applying the methodology to more challenging systems , such as the helium atom in strong fields@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sub : review - of - pvb ] we present a brief review of the pvb approach as applied to the full hilbert space .",
    "we begin by clarifying the underlying hilbert space spanned by the fourier grid method .",
    "we then define the von neumann lattice of gaussians . by projecting the von neumann basis onto the hilbert space spanned by the fourier grid",
    "we generate the periodic von neumann ( pvn ) basis ( section [ sub : the - von - neumann ] ) .",
    "since the pvn basis is non - orthogonal we can define the basis that is biorthogonal ( section [ sub : bi - orthogonal - bases ] ) . in section ( [ sub : pvn , pvb ] )",
    "we show that the role of the pvn basis and the biorthogonal basis must be exchanged to obtain a sparse representation .",
    "we conclude section [ sub : review - of - pvb ] with a discussion of the possible forms of the schrdinger equation in the pvb representation . having established the formalism on the full hilbert space , we turn to the representation on a reduced space .",
    "section [ sub : the - reduced - basis ] introduces the reduced pvb method , allowing one to represent only those regions of phase space actually occupied by the current state .",
    "we then define the biorthogonal bases for the reduced subspace ( section [ sub : bi - orthogonal - bases - for ] ) and analyze the projection into the reduced subspace ( section [ sub : the - projector ] ) , highlighting the differences between orthogonal and non - orthogonal projections . in section [ sub : the - tdse - for - the - reduced_state ] we derive the various forms of the schrdinger equation in the reduced representations and discuss approximations and performance considerations . section [ sec : examples ] gives some illustrative examples and section [ sec : conclusions - and - outlook ] gives an outlook and some ideas for future work .",
    "the pvb representation , developed in@xcite , projects the von neumann lattice of gaussians ( section [ sub : the - von - neumann ] ) onto the subspace spanned by the fourier grid ( section [ sub : the - fourier - grid ] ) . as the projected gaussians form a non - orthogonal basis , we define the basis biorthogonal to the projected gaussians ( section [ sub : bi - orthogonal - bases ] ) . together",
    "these building blocks define the pvb representation ( section [ sub : pvn , pvb ] ) .",
    "we then present several alternative but equivalent formulations of the schrdinger equation in the pvb representation ( section [ sub : schroedinger - equation - in - pvb ] ) .",
    "the pseudospectral fourier method@xcite ( also known as the periodic sinc dvr ( discrete variable representation@xcite ) ) is the underlying hilbert space on which we construct the pvb method .",

    "is possible .",
    "specifically , one may further reduce the representation by decomposing multi - dimensional objects into a sum - of - products , and truncating the sum when the correlation is sufficiently low .",
    "this strategy is used by the potfit algorithm to decompose the potential , but a similar approach could be used for the wavefunction and the reduced hamiltonian .",
    "this is a challenging problem , however , as the dynamics continuously modify the reduced basis , which generally is not easily decomposable",
    ".    further areas of research include the correspondence between pvb and other phase space representations , including the discrete husimi and wigner representation .",
    "we also plan to explore the treatment of particle symmetries ( bosonic , fermionic ) in multi - particle implementations of the pvb method .    beyond method development",
    ", there is a wide range of problems which are amenable to the pvb methodology , including high - harmonic generation , multi - electron ionization , photodissociation and chemical reactions .",
    "we intend to explore these applications in the near future .    to conclude , pvb is an accurate , scalable and efficient method for quantum dynamics simulations , and it is our hope that it will find its place as part of the standard quantum numerics toolbox .",
