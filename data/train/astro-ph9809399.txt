    "as part of a program to study newly rosat - discovered supersoft x - ray sources ( greiner 1996 ) the field of  was observed between december 24 , 1991 in a short ( 2.3 ksec ) pointing centered on rxj0800.44746 which later turned out to be a white dwarf ( fleming et al .",
    "( @xmath21rxs 080346.3474838 ; henceforth referred to as ) appeared therein as the second brightest x - ray source ( average count rate @xmath3  cts / sec ) located @xmath437   off - axis .",
    "it s x - ray flux was strongly modulated ( @xmath495% ) rising to a peak - rate of @xmath41.2 cts / sec at the end of the pointing ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ; left ) .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is very soft , with virtually no counts above 0.5  kev as indicated by the hardness ratio hr1=@xmath5 .",
    "the spectrum can be readily deconvolved with an absorbed blackbody model ( @xmath6=1.04 ) .",
    "the inclusion of an additional bremsstrahlung component ( with fixed @xmath7 kev ) yields no significantly better fit ( @xmath6=1 ) and only slightly alters the blackbody parameters .",
    "the best - fit range of temperature and absorbing columns is @xmath8  ev and @xmath9  @xmath10 at the 95% confidence level .",
    "we can set a firm upper limit on the flux - ratio in the rosat band @xmath11 ( with @xmath12  ev and @xmath13  kev fixed ) .",
    "the positional error of @xmath450  made an optical identification in this crowded galactic plane region ( b@xmath14=87 ) difficult .",
    "we therefore obtained a rosat hri pointing between may 12 and june 7 , 1994 which constrained the x - ray position to @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the cv is the only optical counterpart found within the 10  hri error circle and has end figures 456 and 47 .",
    "the x - ray light - curve of the hri observation folded on the preliminary photometric ephemeris ( see below ) revealed no strong orbital variations , but a non - zero count - rate at nearly all phases with an average count rate of @xmath17 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ; right ) consistent with the mean rate during the pspc pointing ( note the conversion factor of 7.8 between hri and pspc count rates for such soft x - ray spectra ) .",
    "only one observing interval and is thus certainly not a permanent feature .",
    "follow - up ccd - photometry was obtained on march 26 - 27 , 1995 and january 17 - 18 , 1998 at la silla using the 2.2  m+efosc and the 1.5  m - danish+dfosc , respectively .",
    "we carried out a period search on the individual data sets using the analysis - of - variance method ( schwarzenberg - cerny 1989 ) . both periodograms ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ; right ) are consistent with a best - fit period of @xmath4137 min , although one - day aliases at 122 and 145 min are quite prominent .",
    "the latter are definitively ruled out by a @xmath18 calculation applied to the timings of the four minima observed ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ; right , lower panel ) .",
    "this shows a fine alias structure ( due to the 3 year separation ) around the best guess period at 137.1 min which is used to define a preliminary ephemeris of @xmath19 due to the aliasing the estimated uncertainty is still high ( @xmath2000003 ) .",
    "the folded light curves ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ; left ) are characterized by a v - shaped minimum with 2 mag amplitude ( @xmath21 ) followed by a double - humped bright phase .",
    "the overall appearance is similar to that of v834 cen ( schwope & beuermann 1990 ) , suggesting a geometry where the main accreting pole is permanently in view ( @xmath22 ) and closest to the observer at optical minimum .",
    "accretion rate and/or geometry may vigorously change on rather small time scales causing the large cycle - to - cycle variations ( of about 0.5 mag ) as observed on january 18 , 1998 .",
    "our 1995 photometry was complemented by 8 low - resolution spectra covering approximately one orbital cycle with a time resolution of 15 min . fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( left ) shows a subset of consecutive spectra .",
    "the spectra are dominated by intense emission lines of the balmer series , heii @xmath1 , and hei superimposed on a blue continuum .",
    "the inverted balmer decrement and the strength of the heii @xmath1line being about 2/3 of h@xmath23 suggest a magnetic cv classification .",
    "this is directly confirmed by the detection of cyclotron lines at phases 0.70.8 .",
    "the separation of the 4th/5th/6th harmonics ( seen at @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) of the cyclotron fundamental suggest a magnetic field strength of 39@xmath203 mg depending on the plasma temperature and the viewing angle @xmath27 . a corresponding cyclotron model is shown in fig .",
