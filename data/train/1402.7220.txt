    "in the past few years , rotating bose gases have been intensively studied in the context of trapped ultracold atomic gases @xcite .",
    "one may expect that rotation suppresses bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) .",
    "like superconductors in magnetic field , vortices may be formed inside the condensate when it is rotated and the abrikosov vortex lattice can even be observed @xcite .",
    "more strikingly , rotating condensates in the fast - rotation limit are expected to exhibit novel quantum phases analogous to the quantum hall state of electrons , if interactions between atoms are taken into account @xcite .",
    "earlier experiments to spin up neutral atomic gases are to confine them in a rotating frame @xcite .",
    "more recently , the so - called  synthetic \" magnetic field approach is developed @xcite , which creates an effective gauge potential @xmath0 for neutral atoms by means of optical field @xcite , instead of rotating the frame . in this case , atoms behave like charged particles in magnetic field .",
    "the  synthetic \" magnetic field has already been realized in experiments and can be produced significantly large , which makes it hopefully to achieve the fast - rotating limit @xcite .",
    "although most research work on rotating bose gases , both experimental and theoretical , focuses on the ground state properties or behaviors of rotating condensates , thermodynamic properties have also stimulated a number of interests @xcite .",
    "the emphasis is mainly laid on bose gases in the rotating frame .",
    "it is reported that the critical temperature decreases with the rotation frequency apparently @xcite .",
    "recent attention was also paid into the gases in  synthetic \" magnetic field @xcite .    the theoretical treatment in above works is mainly based on the semi - classical approximation ( sca ) , in which the energy spectrum is treated as a continuum and thus the summation over the discrete single - particle energy levels is converted into phase - space integrals .",
    "the sca approach offers qualitatively accurate descriptions of thermodynamics of bose gases without rotation through an extremely simple and efficient way @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is an effective approach to deal with bose gases in the rotating frame @xcite .",
    "however , problem arises when the sca approach is applied to ideal bose gases in  synthetic \" magnetic field @xcite .",
    "for example , the bec temperature in this case has no relation with the magnetic field . in the meanwhile ,",
    "the landau diamagnetism also keeps unchanging at all temperatures @xcite .",
    "these unphysical results urge us to seek a more efficient treatment beyond the sca approach .",
    "the direct way to go beyond the sca is to reconsider the discrete nature of the single - particle energy levels .",
    "therefore , we compute the thermodynamic quantities of rotating trapped ideal bose gases by performing the summation over discrete energy levels numerically by truncating the summation at certain order .",
    "this truncated - summation approach ( tsa ) produces reliable results and overcomes the disadvantage of the sca when applying to ideal bose gases in  synthetic \" magnetic field .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 outlines main results on the basis of the semi - classical approximation and discusses briefly the problem that causes .",
