    "<S> a nearly flat band available in a tunable sawtooth lattice would offer a versatile platform for the study of interaction - driven quantum many - body states with ultracold atoms .    </S>",
    "<S> recent experimental and theoretical advancements in optical lattices hold out a promise of engineering the band structures , the amplitude and the phase of inter - site tunnelling energies , and on - site interactions in the hubbard regime  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the highly tunable optical lattices @xcite would realise unconventional band structures that are not easy to study in solid - state materials , including flat bands with completely quenched kinetic energies or topological bands . </S>",
    "<S> flat band occurs in a variety of condensed - matter systems , ranging from the landau levels of an electron gas@xcite , edge states of graphene  @xcite to unconventional superconductors  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such flattened band structures significantly enhance interaction effects and show a wide range of interaction - driven many - body phenomena from supersolidity @xcite to flat - band ferromagnetism @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> intriguingly , the divergence in the density of states at the energy of the flat band prevents natural ordering in the system@xcite , and the question still remains whether or not bose - einstein condensation is stable in a flat band  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the interaction - induced localised state reveals crystalline phases in fractional - filled bosons and fermions in a flat band @xcite and more interestingly topological flat bands with nonzero chern number open a new way for realising a fractional quantum hall state without landau levels  @xcite .    in the ultracold atomic system , </S>",
    "<S> a bulk flat band appears though the whole system when the hopping matrix elements are destructively interfered such as in kagome @xcite , lieb @xcite , sawtooth@xcite lattices . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has not been experimentally explored in great depth so far how the flat dispersion affects the ground state of bosons and fermions except the very recent work in which the decay of the bosons from the flat excited band has been studied  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the flat band is usually not a ground band in a typical optical lattice with negative tunnelling energy  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the surface flat band has been also theoretically investigated in optical checkerboard lattices when the system is topologically nontrivial @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> intriguingly , a nearly flat band can be also obtained by including the spin degrees of freedom in the presence of the spin - orbit coupling  @xcite or the dipolar interactions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note similar flattened quartic dispersion is also available in the shaken lattice @xcite .    in this work , we describe a one - dimensional tunable optical zigzag lattice @xcite and then analyse the geometric conversion from a zigzag into a sawtooth optical lattice that provides a nearly flat band  @xcite . especially , a sawtooth lattice has attracted significant interest due to the flat band structure but the creation of tunable sawtooth geometry has not been proposed to our knowledge . </S>",
    "<S> our approach relies on a tunable superlattice generated by commensurate wavelengths that are red - detuned to the principle optical transition of atoms . </S>",
    "<S> we first demonstrate a method to fully control tunnelling matrix elements in the zigzag configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the full control of zigzag lattice is the critical step to access a nearly flat band in a sawtooth lattice which is converted from the original zigzag configuration . only for certain lattice configuration satisfying the relation @xmath3 between inter-(@xmath0 ) and intra-(@xmath1 ) unit - cell tunnelling energies , </S>",
    "<S> a flat band shows up in the sawtooth geometry . </S>",
    "<S> we analyse the band structure of the sawtooth and zigzag lattices for various lattice settings and provide a recipe for obtaining a nearly flat band in the sawtooth configuration . </S>",
    "<S> besides the sawtooth lattice containing a flat band , a one - dimensional zigzag chain @xcite also reveals particularly rich physics due to the interplay between frustration imposed by lattice geometry and two ( three)-body interactions . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , a chiral bosonic superfluid is expected in a zigzag lattice , which may become a mott insulator even at small interactions  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> we assume that both short - wavelength ( sw ) and long - wavelength ( lw ) lattices are red - detuned from the principle optical transition of the atom and commensurate with each other . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the wavelength of 532 nm ( sw ) and 1064 nm ( lw ) lights are employed for ytterbium atoms with the principle optical transition of 399  nm  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> all lights are vertically polarised perpendicular to the lattice plane , which results in the sw lattice potential ( say @xmath4 ) . </S>",

    "<S> we note other geometries such as a triangular or a square lattice can be also generated as described in fig.[fig : schematic ] ( b ) , but we focus on the zigzag and sawtooth lattices for the rest of the discussion . </S>",
    "<S> finally , additional square lattice generated by the 1064 nm light is incoherently added with the maximum trap depth of @xmath6 in order to convert the zigzag to the sawtooth lattice . here , the frequency difference ( e.g. at least 10  mhz or larger ) between @xmath5 and @xmath6 laser fields is asuumed to minimise the interference effect .    with all beams in hand , </S>",

    "<S> the zigzag lattice has the two lowest energy @xmath39-orbital bands corresponding to two basis lattice sites , labeled by @xmath36 and @xmath29 , within the unit cell ( see fig . </S>",

    "<S> the inter - unit - cell tunnelling between neighbouring a ( or b ) wells is defined as @xmath0 ( or @xmath30 ) , and the intra - unit - cell tunnelling between a and b is @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we employ a large potential depth of the lw lattice @xmath40 to isolate a one - dimensional array in vertical direction , and therefore the coupling between adjacent one - dimensional zigzag lattices is negligible . with symmetric zigzag lattice configuration </S>",
    "<S> , we have @xmath41 . in this case , the band structure is determined by inter- ( @xmath0 , @xmath30 ) and intra- ( @xmath1 ) unit - cell tunnelling energies as shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> a flat band in the sawtooth lattice , let us first consider the particular ratio of @xmath42 required to support a flat band in a tight - binding model . </S>",
    "<S> a sawtooth lattice with a flat band will be obtained if we make @xmath43 , and the relation @xmath34 is satisfied  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these two conditions can be achieved by varying the parameters of the optical potential such as @xmath44 . to achieve the first condition of @xmath43 </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce the square lattice of the potential depth @xmath6 as described below , and then we vary the ratio between @xmath26 and @xmath23 to satisfy the second requirement of @xmath45 in the sawtooth lattice .    </S>",
    "<S> here we first demonstrate the way to fully control the tunnelling ratio @xmath42 in the zigzag case before we discuss the transform of the lattice into the sawtooth configuration . as it is difficult to obtain an obvious relation connecting the potential parameters @xmath26 and @xmath23 with the tunnelling energy @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we first calculate the bloch state of the two - dimensional superlattice using the plane - wave expansion method with variable lattice settings  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then , we perform least - square fitting of the band structure along the y - direction by the one - dimensional tight binding model of the zigzag lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian for the zigzag lattice in the second quantised form is given : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the annihilation operator at the site @xmath48 in the @xmath49-th unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> then in the momentum - space basis @xmath50 , the hamiltonian is diagonalised giving the tight - binding matrix @xmath51 of the zigzag lattice . @xmath52    where @xmath53 denotes the lowest eigen - energy of the quantum well @xmath36,@xmath29 and @xmath54 the lattice constant .    </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath31 and @xmath41 are naturally satisfied in the zigzag lattice we consider here , the tight binding dispersion for a zigzag lattice is then simplified to : @xmath55    this dispersion is quite sensitive to the ratio @xmath42 as shown in fig.[fig2 ] ( a ) . therefore fitting the band structure obtained by the plane - wave expansion method with the eq.([eq4 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the ratio of @xmath42 from the potential parameters @xmath26 and @xmath23 as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ( b ) . to fulfil the condition @xmath56 , the ratio of @xmath57 should be extremely high around the order for about @xmath58100 . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> the hopping integrals are quite sensitive to the overlap between wannier functions . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , they are exponentially dependent on space coordinates , and therefore the hopping elements are very sensitive to the separation between the associated potential wells . for current form of the potential </S>",
    "<S> well , the separation between two neighbouring @xmath36 wells that is about @xmath59 times larger than the separation between neighbouring @xmath36 and @xmath29 wells , and therefore it will generate an extremely large @xmath42 ratio . to reduce this ratio down to @xmath60 </S>",
    "<S> , we have to modify the shape of the potential wells reducing @xmath1 and enhancing @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> so it s necessary to increase @xmath57 ratio , making the potential wells longer and narrower . </S>",
    "<S> this method reduces the overlap between a and b wells , but enhances the overlap between neighbouring a wells explaining the reason for such a large value of @xmath57 .     between the bandwidths for the ground and the first excited band </S>",

    "<S> , the bar around the date point indicates the characteristic range of ( @xmath63 ) in which the flatness @xmath62 is larger than 50 . </S>",

    "<S> the potential maximum ( minimum ) of the @xmath6 lattice is aligned to the middle point of neighbouring @xmath29 ( @xmath36 ) wells as described in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ( c ) . </S>",
    "<S> then , the square lattice with the depth @xmath6 will generate an additional barrier between neighbouring b wells reducing @xmath30 significantly . </S>",
    "<S> because the barrier between neighbouring @xmath36 wells are reduced by @xmath6 , and therefore the @xmath64 should get modified to take this effect into account . from our analysis , making @xmath65 ( in the zigzag lattice ) is necessary to balance the effect of @xmath6 .     is increased . at the lattice setting of @xmath66 , </S>",
    "<S> the energies of the lowest two bands are calculated for @xmath67@xmath68 ( left to right ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) in this setting , the first excited band becomes flattened with bandwidths from @xmath6950  hz to @xmath690.2  hz where the maximum flatness @xmath62 is @xmath58300 . here </S>",
    "<S> the bandwidth is calculated for ytterbium atoms as an example . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) the real space optical potential and its corresponding momentum distribution are shown . </S>",
    "<S> the momentum distribution is calculated from the fourier transform of the single - particle ground state in the real space . in the momentum distribution , </S>",
    "<S> the area of the black dot reflects the fractional population at the reciprocal site and the * g * and * a * denote the reciprocal and the lattice vectors of the one - dimensional zigzag lattice respectively.,width=5 ]    indeed we investigate the dependance of the flatness of the first excited band on the lattice setting @xmath70 . to measure the flatness of the first excited band , </S>",
    "<S> we define the ratio between the bandwidths of the ground and the first excited band as @xmath62 , and numerically calculate @xmath62 as a function of @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath6 as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . since the ratio @xmath57 must be large to obtain @xmath60 in the sawtooth lattice , we scan the potential depth @xmath23 around @xmath73 setting the potential depth @xmath26 from 28@xmath74 to 46@xmath74 </S>",
    "<S> . as @xmath26 decreases , the ratio @xmath42 increases ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ( b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the relatively deep square lattice potential of @xmath6 is required to keep the small value of @xmath42 for achieving a nearly flat band . from our numerical analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we find the flatness of r@xmath7550 can be easily achieved for a wide range of the lattice setting . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , we provide a set of parameters @xmath70 where the flatness @xmath62 is at least over 50 from @xmath76 and @xmath77 . for a real flat band in a sawtooth lattice , however , it s necessary to set the tunnelling @xmath30 to be exactly zero . </S>",
    "<S> this requires the barrier between neighbouring @xmath29 sites to be as large as possible , and therefore we should increase @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> however the increase of @xmath6 also has consequence in reducing the barrier between neighbouring @xmath36 sites . </S>",
    "<S> so with the presence of the square lattice , @xmath36 and @xmath29 potential wells are no longer identical to each other . this will give rise to slight difference in eigenvalues of the two potential wells @xmath78 and @xmath79 causing that the first excited band becomes dispersive ( see eq.([tbeq ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the presence of the square lattice with @xmath6 suppresses the tunnelling @xmath30 but introduces the finite dispersion of the first excited band at the same time . </S>",
    "<S> those limitations are prominent at the small value of @xmath80 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , and thus the bandwidth ratio between the ground and the first excited bands has a maximum value of @xmath81400 . for a larger value of @xmath82 , </S>",
    "<S> the first excited band become flattened at the small value of @xmath6 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the tunnelling @xmath30 can not be completely suppressed causing a small dispersion ( or @xmath83 ) of the band . </S>",
    "<S> this limitation can be readily solved by employing the lattice shaking technique which allows us to control the tunnelling @xmath0 and @xmath1 independently  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally we demonstrate how the dispersive band in the zigzag lattice is adiabatically changed into a nearly flat band in the sawtooth lattice . as an example in fig.[fig4 ] ( a ) , the two lowest energy bands are shown as @xmath6 increases with the lattice setting of @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> the first excited band becomes flatter as the lattice geometry is changed from the zigzag to the sawtooth limit . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the bandwidth of the first excited band becomes @xmath851  hz in this sawtooth limit where @xmath86 is the planck constant . </S>",
    "<S> considering a typical energy scale of on - site interaction energy at the intermediate lattice depth , a nearly flat band realised in this setting should reveal the effect of flat band associated with interactions . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , geometry of the undergoing lattice structure can be easily confirmed in an experiment with a bosonic superfluid occupying the ground state of the lattice potential . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ( c ) , the expected momentum distribution of bosonic atoms is shown for zigzag and sawtooth lattices , which is obtained from the calculation of the single - particle ground state .    in optical lattices , </S>",
    "<S> a flat band often emerges in either the second or third lowest energy band for sawtooth ( or lieb ) and kagome lattices respectively . in general </S>",
    "<S> , one may shake the optical lattice to flip the sign of the tunnelling energy by which atoms can be directly loaded in the flat band  @xcite . for bosons , </S>",
    "<S> atoms can be coherently transferred at the particular quasi - momentum ( say @xmath87=0 point ) by manipulating the energy level of the sub - lattice site  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the bosonic atoms in the flat band may decay into the lowest band as observed in the lieb lattice  @xcite , but the lifetime of atoms in the flat band can be lengthened by increasing the band gap  @xcite . the effect of the flat band for fermions , however , should be observable with minimal decay into the lowest band when the fermi energy is controlled near the energy of the flat band .    in this work , we provide a recipe to realise a one - dimensional sawtooth optical lattice with ultracold atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the highly tunable superlattice proposed here would offer a flexible experimental platform for the study of a flat band which is attainable in the sawtooth geometry . by simply adjusting lattice parameters and </S>",
    "<S> therefore controlling intra- and inter - unit - cell tunnelling , the first excited band becomes flat up to 2@xmath2 of the ground bandwidth for a wide range of the lattice setting . </S>",
    "<S> our superlattice yields the zigzag and sawtooth lattices for alkali - earth - like bosons and fermions ( e.g. @xmath88yb and @xmath89sr isotopes ) , in which various interaction - driven phenomena can be addressed in a flat band .    </S>",
