    "the breaking of a long flux tube between two static quarks into a quark - antiquark pair is one of the most fundamental phenomena in qcd . because of its highly non - perturbative nature",
    "it has defied analytical calculation , while its large scale , e.g. when compared to the sizes of composite particles in the theory , has caused difficulties in standard nonperturbative methods .",
    "thus string breaking has remained a widely publicized feature of the strong interaction that has never , apart from rough models , been reproduced from the theory .",
    "string breaking can occur in hadronic decays of @xmath0 mesons and is especially relevant when this meson is lying close to a meson - antimeson ( @xmath1 ) threshold .",
    "for the heaviest quarks involved in these decays applying heavy quark effective theory is a reasonable approximation .",
    "due to recent advances in both computational hardware and algorithms , much interest in lattice qcd has been devoted to attempts to observe string breaking .",
    "the direct approach of trying to see the flattening in the static @xmath0 potential at large separation has been successful only at temperatures close to the critical one  @xcite .",
    "the failure of this wilson loop method at zero temperature seems to be mainly due to the poor overlap of the operator(s ) with the @xmath1 state  @xcite . in much more easily calculable adjoint @xmath2 and @xmath2+higgs models without fermions",
    "a variational approach with explicit inclusion of both the wilson loop and scalar bound state operators has worked well @xcite . in three - dimensional su(2 ) with staggered fermions an improved action approach has been claimed to be successful with just wilson loops  @xcite . in qcd with fermions",
    "effective operators for @xmath3 systems are , however , hard to implement ; part of the problem is the exhausting computational effort required to get sufficient statistics for light quark propagators with conventional techniques for fermion matrix inversion .    a new technique of calculating estimates of light quark propagators using monte carlo techniques on pseudo - fermionic field configurations  @xcite with maximal variance reduction  @xcite has been found to be very useful for systems including heavy quarks taken as static , such as single heavy - light mesons and baryons and also two heavy - light mesons  @xcite .",
    "the application of this method to the string breaking problem seems natural .",
    "our previous work @xcite has concentrated on bound states of two heavy - light mesons and mechanisms of their attraction for various values of light quark isospin @xmath4 and spin @xmath5 . here",
    "we continue by studying the @xmath1 system for @xmath6 together with the @xmath0 system at distances around the string breaking point @xmath7 fm , where the energies of the two systems are equal if there is no mixing .",
    "when a quark and an antiquark are created from the vacuum they should have the @xmath8 quantum numbers of the vacuum . a quark - antiquark pair with @xmath9",
    "has lowest orbital angular momentum @xmath10 and is in a spin triplet .",
    "this so - called quark pair creation or @xmath11 model was combined with a harmonic oscillator flux tube model by isgur _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite to describe local breaking ( formation ) of a flux tube . in our calculation",
    "the symmetries of the static approximation for the heavy quark automatically lead to only the light quark spin triplet being nonzero , which can be seen from the dirac spin structure of the heavy - light diagram in fig .",
    "[ fdiag ] .",
    "string breaking can also occur for hybrid mesons where the gluon field between two quarks is in an excited state .",
    "table  [ texcite ] presents the couplings of some low - lying gluonic excitations to the quantum numbers of the resulting meson - antimeson in the static limit for the heavy quarks . in this limit cp and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the interquark axis , are conserved .",
    "the table lists the representations of these symmetries ( with @xmath14 corresponding to @xmath15 respectively and @xmath16 corresponding to cp=@xmath17 ) . for the lowest - lying excitation , which has @xmath18 symmetry with @xmath19 , only non - zero angular momenta @xmath20 for the resulting mesons @xmath21 , @xmath22",
    "would be allowed , as @xmath5 has to be zero to generate a negative @xmath23 .    here ,",
    "as for the other symmetries , @xmath24 as we need the same flavour for the light quarks . the @xmath25 cases do not correspond to spontaneous breaking of a string in vacuum but a correlation of a @xmath0+@xmath26 system with a @xmath27+@xmath28 system at different time , i.e. the breaking of a string in the presence of a meson .",
    "when the table is extended to nonzero @xmath29 for the heavy quark plus antiquark ( as opposed to @xmath30 for a single meson ) the @xmath31 values get multiplied with @xmath32 .",
    "the energy levels also change ; these retardation effects have been found to be relatively small  @xcite .",
    "previously string breaking in hybrid mesons has been discussed from a phenomenological point of view using an extension of the approach of isgur _ et al .",
    "_ , i.e. a nonrelativistic flux - tube model with decay operators from strong coupling limit of lattice gauge theory and heavy quark expansion of qcd in coulomb gauge  @xcite . from this",
    "model two selection rules were given , the first one agreeing with the @xmath18 case in table  [ texcite ] ; low - lying hybrids do not decay into identical mesons , the predominant channel being one @xmath33 and one @xmath34-wave meson .",
    "the second rule prohibits decay of spin singlet states into only spin singlets , which is not relevant to our calculation as our heavy quark spin decouples .",
    "an important question for hybrid meson phenomenology is the nature of the lowest state for a given set of quantum numbers at a particular heavy quark separation ; a hybrid @xmath0 meson , a ground - state @xmath0 meson with a @xmath26 meson or a system of two heavy - light mesons .",
    "it is also useful to know the strength of mixing between these states .",
    "this information can be obtained , in principle , from lattice calculations and used to decide what sort of bound states are most likely to exist and what their decays will be ( see also ref .",
    "we use su(3 ) lattice qcd on a @xmath35 lattice with the wilson gauge action and the sheikholeslami - wohlert quark action with a nonperturbative `` clover coefficient '' @xmath36 and @xmath37 with two degenerate flavours of both valence and sea quarks .",
    "the measurements were performed on 20 gauge configurations .",
    "the gauge configurations are the same as in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath38 . with these parameters",
    "we get a lattice spacing @xmath39 fm and meson mass ratio @xmath40 .    estimators of propagators of quarks from point @xmath41 to point @xmath42 can be obtained from pseudofermion fields @xmath43 . for each gauge configuration a sample of the pseudofermion fields",
    "is generated , and the propagators are then obtained by monte carlo integration  @xcite . thus there is one monte carlo averaging for the gauge samples , and another one for the pseudofermion samples for each gauge sample . in order to reduce statistical variance of propagators a variance reduction method similar to multi - hit can be used  @xcite ; such a reduction is essential in practice .",
    "our variance reduction involves division of the lattice in two regions , whose boundary is kept fixed while the @xmath43-fields inside are replaced by their multi - hit averages .",
    "we use 24 pseudofermionic configurations per each gauge configuration .",
    "figure  [ fdiag ] shows the diagrams involved in the calculation with the time axis in the horizontal direction .",
    "the solid lines are heavy quark propagators , which in the static approximation are just products of gauge field variables .",
    "the wiggly lines are light quark propagators , obtained essentially as a product of pseudofermionic variables from each end which have to be in different variance reduced regions  @xcite .    in the large @xmath44 limit both the quark - antiquark and two - meson operators should in principle approach @xmath45 with @xmath46 being the ground state of the system . in practice",
    "the wilson loop has a very small overlap with the two - meson state , which leads to great practical difficulties in observing the flattening @xmath47 from it at large @xmath48 .",
    "the heavy - light term @xmath49 is necessary to obtain the correct ground state by explicitly including both quark - antiquark and two - meson states , and allows us to measure their overlap , which is crucial for string breaking to happen .",
    "to estimate the ground ( and excited ) state energy of our observables we always use a variational basis formed from different degrees of spatial _ fuzzing _ of the operators .",
    "this allows the use of moderate values of @xmath44 instead of the infinite time limit to reduce excited state contributions .",
    "the resulting correlation matrix @xmath50 is then diagonalised to get the eigenenergies .    due to the variance reduction method dividing the lattice in two halves in the time direction , the box diagram and the heavy - light correlator in fig .",
    "[ fdiag ] have to be turned `` sideways '' on the lattice ; i.e. , the time axis in the diagrams is taken to be one of the spatial axes to keep the light quark propagators going from one variance reduced volume to another .",
    "this induces technical complications that greatly increase the memory and cpu demands of the measurement program .    for two flavours",
    "the @xmath24 wavefunction is of the form @xmath51 , which gives factors of @xmath52 for @xmath53 respectively . for light quark",
    "spin we get the triplet states as in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this first study",
    "we concentrate on the ground state breaking , i.e. the first row of table  [ texcite ] .",
    "investigation of the hybrid meson breaking requires diagrams not included in fig .",
    "[ fdiag ] , which involve the hybrid @xmath0 and @xmath54 operators .",
    "we estimate that for the @xmath18 excited state the excited string breaking happens in the same distance range as for the ground state due to the non - zero momenta of the resulting mesons ( masses taken from ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which makes it harder to obtain sufficient accuracy as the spatial operators for excitations involve subtractions rather than sums of lattice paths .",
    "a full variational matrix involving the wilson loop , heavy - light correlator and the @xmath1 correlators gives the ground and excited state energies and corresponding operator overlaps as a function of heavy quark separation , in analogue to the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite for the adjoint string breaking and refs .",
    "@xcite for the su(2)+higgs model .",
    "we use a local light quark creation ( annihilation ) operator and an extended version where a fuzzed path of link variables with length two separates the operator from the heavy quark line . for the link variables involved in the @xmath0 operators we have two fuzzing levels .",
    "the two @xmath0 and three @xmath1 basis states then give a @xmath55 correlation matrix @xmath50 that can be diagonalised .",
    "however , for our present statistics the full matrix gives a reasonable signal only for @xmath56 .    in figure  [ fvari ]",
    "the results from a calculation using just the most fuzzed basis states for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( a @xmath57 matrix ) are shown .",
    "at @xmath58 we would expect the ground and excited state energies to be separated by twice the mixing coefficient @xmath59 ( see below ) .",
    "we observe a larger separation which is presumably due to our statistics not being sufficient to give accurate plateaus for the energies .        in full qcd , there is mixing of energy levels between states coupling to wilson lines ( flux tube ) and @xmath1 states . to get the mixing matrix element the correlation between a wilson line and a @xmath1 operator has to be considered . in order to study",
    "the operator mixing from this heavy - light correlator one needs to use results ( energies and couplings ) from both diagonal operators separately : thus from the wilson loop ( with ground state contribution given by @xmath60 $ ] ) and the unconnected @xmath1 correlator ( eg . @xmath61 $ ] from the ground state ) where we use a variational basis to suppress excited states .",
    "the ground state contribution to the heavy - light correlator can then be written as @xmath62 in the quenched case the contributions from fermion loops inside the correlator are absent , removing the @xmath63 terms in eq .",
    "[ ehlcq ] .",
    "the box term is expressed in the same manner as @xmath64    the operator mixing coefficient @xmath59 for the @xmath0 and @xmath3 states can be extracted from these expressions . near the string breaking point ( where @xmath65 ) , in the infinite time limit , only the ground state contributions survive .",
    "we use @xmath66 the factors of @xmath67 account for departures from the string breaking point .    in the quenched case",
    "there is no mixing between the energy levels of the quark - antiquark and two - meson systems , and @xmath59 can be extracted using eqs .",
    "[ ex1],[ex2 ] . as @xmath68 the non - leading terms in the expressions for @xmath59 are small and we may use also these formulas with our unquenched data - with a resulting decrease in errors compared to the full variational study of the preceeding subsection",
    ".    our assumption about neglecting excited state contributions can be tested by obtaining consistent results for @xmath59 from both relations for several @xmath44 values . to improve further on our estimate of @xmath59",
    "we diagonalise separately @xmath69 and @xmath70 to enhance the ground state contributions and use the first two diagonalisations to extract the ground state of @xmath49 .",
    "our results with bootstrap errors can be seen in table  [ tx ] .",
    "assuming constant @xmath59 for @xmath71 fm gives us a best estimate of @xmath72 mev .",
    "this is about half of the value of @xmath73 mev obtained using a strong coupling mixing model and the experimental @xmath74 decay rate  @xcite .",
    "our analysis shows that the string breaking matrix element is small but non - zero .",
    "we are able , however , to find two independent ways to estimate it ( using all four diagrams in fig .  1 ) and we obtain @xmath75 mev with light quarks that are around the strange quark mass . this is the first non - perturbative determination from qcd of the string breaking matrix element . because of its small value , direct observation of string breaking from the spectrum is difficult to achieve .",
    "we thank a.m. green and k. rummukainen for discussions .",
    "some of the calculations , consuming 70 gb of disk and @xmath76 flops , were performed with the excellent resources provided by the csc in espoo , finland .",
