    "so what is the weight of this argument ? it is based on ingenious experiments which allow a system of independent microsystems to be returned , by macroscopic means , to a phase state close to the one they were in at an earlier time .",

    "the first would be be an internal cooperative effect , in this case a spin  spin coupling .",
    "remarks that the decrease in the echo  pulse arising from this is `` from [ the ] present point of view accidental '' .",
    "he is content to consider a system of independent microsystems , because in any event the inclusion of cooperative effects would not allow an escape from the iron hand of liouville s theorem ; the fine - grained gibbs entropy would still be constant .",
    "he is interested in the external ( spin  lattice ) source of the deviation from exact return .",
    "this interventionist alternative to coarse - graining , which is also the position of and will not be discussed here .",
    "rather we return to the original contention that the demonstration of a system which can be controlled more - or - less exactly at the microscopic level by macroscopic means is the death - blow for coarse - graining .",
    "of course , the coarse - graining referred to by ( and also by and ) is of the gibbs ",
    "ehrenfest type and it is true that in justifying this argues that `` in making any actual measurement of the [ macroscopic variables ] of the system @xmath141 we ordinarily do not achieve the precise knowledge of their values theoretically permitted by classical mechanics '' .",
    "but if this were the main argument for coarse - graining of the gibbs  erhenfest or boltzmann kind it would be very weak .",
    "it has always been possible to obtain analytic solutions for assemblies of non - interacting microsystems and with the advent of fast computing we can , as we have here , produce data for assemblies of arbitrary size .",
    "the fact that such a system can be realized experimentally and controlled macroscopically may have been of great importance technically , but it is hardly a milestone in foundational development .",
    "in fact it is not clear that either or intended to justify the procedure by an appeal to the limitations of measurement .",
    "gibbs ( ibid , p.  148 ) refers to the cells of the coarse - graining as being `` so small that [ the fine - grained probability density function ] may in general be regarded as sensibly constant within any one of them at the initial moment '' and the ehrenfests ( ibid , p.  52 ) simply observe that the cells must be `` small , but finite '' . in the case of the boltzmann entropy the situation is somewhat clearer .",
    "the size of the cells defines the ` macro - scale ' as distinct from the ` micro - scale ' @xcite .",
    "of course , this demarcation is to some extent arbitrary , but it is equally so for any macroscopic physical theory .",
    "as is pointed out by , boltzmann s entropy can be regarded as a measure of homogeneity and in this context the equilibrium state corresponds simply to the maximum entropy state , which has the most homogeneity .",
    "it is precisely and only here , in defining a measure for homogeneity at equilibrium @xcite , that the demarcation between the macro- and micro - scales must be made . and",
    "this is unavoidable since no distribution of discrete points over a continuum is uniform on all scales .",
    "we now consider the case made by for the assertion that the spin  echo system exemplifies circumstances that are `` highly exceptional '' in reproducing the kind of reversible situation used by in his challenge to boltzmann .",
    "the argument hinges on a comparison between a gas expanding in a box and the spin  echo system .",
    "this already presents some problems since , as we have shown in sec .",
    "[ spec ] , the states of a particle moving in one dimension between perfectly reflecting barriers are isomorphic to those of a single spin precessing in a field with the spin ",
    "echo reflection equivalent to velocity inversion .",
    "it follows from this that non - interacting assemblies of each of these are isomorphic . where each particle moves at constant speed in the @xmath65-direction without any collisions is itself `` highly exceptional '' . if so the spin  echo system is irrelevant , except in so far as it is realized experimentally . ]",

    "a spin system or any other assembly is such a way that it will achieve a particular macrostate ( low entropy , high magnetization , etc . ) after a particular interval of time would involve careful adjustment of the relationships of velocities and positions for each microsystem ; a task worthy of a _",

    "the difficult part is left to the system .",
    "the aim of the work of is to use an examination of the spin  echo system to discredit the use of the gibbs - ehrenfest coarse - graining in favour of an interventionist approach . while it is true that the status of the coarse - grained gibbs entropy lacks the clarity of the boltzmann entropy it is by no means clear that the criticisms levelled at this approach by are all valid . in sec .",
    "[ tge ] we described two methods for following the evolution of the coarse - grained gibbs entropy , the first , involving a coarse - graining of the fine - grained distribution at each instant of time , and the second a sequence of re - coarse - graining as time progresses .",
    "the former , which is the standard understanding of the procedure , does not yield a strict monotonic increase of entropy .",
    "however , it does allow the system to retrace its steps , either by velocity reversal or reflection(see fig .",
    "[ spin - echofig5 ] ) .",
    "this is in conflict with the remarks of that a `` reversal of the dynamical evolution in the coarse - grained case does not cause the distribution to evolve back to its original form '' .",
    "they appear to be thinking of the ( obvious ) impossibility of un - coarse - graining a coarse - grained distribution .",
    "the occurrence of the echo in these circumstances would certainly be `` completely miraculous '' ( ibid , p.  1251 ) , but this is not how coarse - grained evolution should be implemented . in any event , the more important question , raised by , is whether the spin  echo system is a `` counterexample to the second law of thermodynamics '' .",
    "the answer to this is surely that it depends on what you mean by the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "if , along with maxwell and boltzmann and probably the majority of physicists entropy increase in an isolated system is taken to be highly probable but not certain , then the spin  echo model , along with simulations of other simple models @xcite , is a nice example of the workings of the law . however , if entropy increase is an iron certainty this example is one , and not a special , example of a violation of the second law .",
    "assert that the spin  echo experiments are not a violation of the second law because `` we do not have a situation where a system evolves spontaneously from a high entropy state to a low entropy state . ''",
    "apart from the obvious conflict with the quote from given above , this , of course , depends on what you mean by `` spontaneous '' .",
    "any experiment or simulation involves preparing the system in some initial state from which it evolves _",
    "spontaneously_. there is no conceptual reason why the system can not be prepared in a state from which the entropy spontaneously decreases .",
    "it just difficult to do because of their relative paucity . as we have already indicated in our discussion the best way to find such",
    "a state is to let the system find it itself by evolving in the reverse direction . then restarting the system in this state it will show a ` spontaneous ' decrease in entropy .",
    "we have considered the case made for the spin  echo experiments being an example of a special system which destroys the argument for using coarse - graining . we have argued that the reason for the boltzmann version of coarse - graining has nothing to do with the inability to do fine - grained dynamic calculations , or experiments , but is based on the necessity to have a demarkation between the micro- and macro - scales .",
    "the same arguments apply to gibbs - ehrenfest coarse - graining .",
    "the spin  echo experiments are of technical significance , particularly in respect of the fact that the echoing procedure can be effected by macroscopic means , but as a theoretical model of an assembly of non - interacting microsystems it is in no way special , as we have shown elsewhere @xcite .",
