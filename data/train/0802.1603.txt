    "the subsurface magnetic structure of sunspots is poorly known .",
    "the theoretical picture is that sunspots are either monolithic or not @xcite , or change from being monolithic to `` disconnected '' over the course of the first few days of their lives @xcite .",
    "the observational picture is limited because the subsurface structure is inherently difficult to infer .",
    "the most promising possibility by far is local helioseismology .",
    "local helioseismology includes several techniques of data analysis , such as fourier - hankel analysis ( _ e.g. _  ) , time - distance analysis ( _ e.g. _  ) and helioseismic holography ( _ e.g. _  ) .",
    "for example the time - distance approach @xcite has been applied to determine wave - speed variations and flows associated with sunspots ( _ e.g. _  ; ; ) .",
    "these inversions did not take into account the direct effects of the magnetic field .",
    "we do not mean to give the impression that such effects have not been investigated , but rather that they are only beginning to be incorporated into helioseismic inversions .",
    "fourier - hankel decompositions of the acoustic wave field ( _ p _ modes ) near sunspots by showed that incoming _",
    "modes are phase - shifted and `` absorbed '' by sunspots .",
    "this triggered many studies of the effects of the magnetic field on solar waves .",
    "for example , suggested that sunspot magnetic fields are responsible for the observed acoustic wave `` absorption '' by partially converting incoming _",
    "modes into slow magnetoacoustic waves .",
    "this idea was followed up in detail by , , , , , , and .",
    "an important result was the realization that non - uniform and non - vertical magnetic fields are required to explain the observations .",
    "in particular , reported on numerical calculations showing that inclined magnetic fields are able to achieve levels of absorption compatible with the observations .",
    "this aspect of the problem was followed up by and , which placed constraints on the strength of the sunspot s magnetic field .",
    "more recently attention has been placed on upward propagating magnetoacoustic waves and their possible observational signatures @xcite .",
    "the use of direct numerical simulations in helioseismology , with or without magnetic fields , has also undergone rapid development .",
    "the aims of these simulations include validating helioseismic techniques ( _ e.g. _  ) and , more importantly , increasing our understanding of what the seismic observations reveal about the solar interior . here",
    "we restrict our focus to simulations of linearized wave propagation through an inhomogeneous solar atmosphere .",
    "examples of these linear wave propagation studies , most of which do not include the direct effects of magnetic fields , include , , , , and .",
    "some results of these studies clearly have a large bearing on the correct interpretation of the helioseismic signatures of sunspots .    in this paper",
    "we first design a technique to image the interaction of waves with sunspots , using appropriate averaging of the cross - correlations of the random seismic wave field ( soho / mdi data ) .",
    "we proceed further by using numerical simulations to do full - waveform forward modeling of the passage of solar waves through a sunspot .",
    "this is done with the slim code @xcite , specifically developed for this purpose .",
    "the ultimate goal is to understand the observed cross - correlations in terms of the properties of our parametric sunspot models .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the soho / mdi observations of sunspot ar9787 are presented in section  [ sec.ar ] and their helioseismic analysis in section  [ sec.xc ] .",
    "we describe our numerical simulation code in section  [ sec.code ] .",
    "we compare the observations ( cross - correlations ) against the vertical velocity on a horizontal cut taken from the simulation at the height of the quiet - sun photosphere .",
    "this , amongst other reasons , means the comparison is only meaningful outside the sunspot .",
    "except in the immediate vicinity of the sunspot , the comparison between the observations and the simulations is very encouraging , as shown in section  [ sec.compare ] .",
    "we place a helioseismic constraint on the sunspot magnetic field in section  [ sec.b ] .",
    "our work strongly suggests that we will be able to use observations and simulations in combination to constrain the subsurface structure of sunspots by taking direct and indirect magnetic effects into account .",
    "the helioseismic analysis of a sunspot is more or less difficult depending on which sunspot is being studied .",
    "we have been searching the soho / mdi database for the ideal sunspot , _ i.e._a",
    "sunspot which is isolated ( does not belong to a complex sunspot group ) , has a simple geometry ( circular shape ) , and evolves slowly in time as it moves across the solar disk . in order to find such a `` theorist s sunspot '' , we searched the mdi dynamics program which combines the advantage of a good spatial resolution ( @xmath0 at disk center ) with a complete view of the solar disk .",
    "the full - disk dopplergrams are available each minute during two to three months each year since 1996 .",
    "the sunspot we have selected is that of active region 9787 , continuously observed by mdi during nine days : 2028 january 2002 .",
    "the dopplergrams were remapped using postel s azimuthal equidistant projection almost  but not exactly  centered on the sunspot , using a tracking angular velocity of @xmath1  day@xmath2 ( in the carrington frame ) .",
    "in addition to the dopplergrams , we also used the line - of - sight magnetograms ( each minute ) and all the intensity images ( one per six hours ) .",
    "the daily averages of these three quantities are shown in figure  [ fig.ar9787obs ] . apart from some plage ,",
    "there is no other active region in the vicinity of the sunspot during the entire observation sequence .",
    "the sunspot of ar9787 is large and quite stable over the nine days of the observations , even though it starts decaying from 27 january onward .    using the mdi intensity images , we measured the center of the sunspot s umbra .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig.spotcoordinates ] , the sunspot has a significant amount of proper motion .",
    "thus we chose to split the time series into six - hour subsets and to analyze each subset separately .",
    "the images belonging to each particular subset were remapped into a new postel map , with the center of the projection corresponding exactly to the center of the sunspot s umbra in the middle of the six - hour time interval .",
    "these 36 six - hour time series of dopplergrams , centered on the sunspot s position , are the basic data that we used for the helioseismic analysis , which we discuss in the next section .",
    "the average intensity image of the sunspot , corrected for the proper motion of the sunspot , is shown in figure  [ fig.int ] . from this average image , which is still sharp ,",
    "we determine the average umbral and penumbral radii to be @xmath3  mm and @xmath4  mm respectively .",
    "we study sunspot ar9787 using cross - covariances of the random wavefield , as is done in time - distance helioseismology ( ) .",
    "the temporal cross - covariance between two points on the solar surface provides information about the green s function between these two points .",
    "this interpretation has recently been shown to be correct in the case of homogeneously distributed random sources in an arbitrarily complex medium ( , ) .    in this paper , for the sake of simplicity , we wish to observe the propagation of _ f _ modes through the sunspot .",
    "thus we filter the dopplergrams in 3d fourier space to only keep the _",
    "f _ modes .",
    "let us denote by @xmath5 the filtered doppler velocity , where @xmath6 is a position vector and @xmath7 is time .",
    "rather than studying the cross - covariance of @xmath8 between two spatial points , we consider the cross - covariance between @xmath8 averaged over a great circle @xmath9 , denoted by @xmath10 , and @xmath8 measured at any other point @xmath11 : @xmath12 where the effective integration time is @xmath13 is nine days , or 36 times six hours .",
    "since averaging @xmath8 over @xmath9 is equivalent to selecting only the horizontal wavevectors that are perpendicular to @xmath9 , the above cross - covariance function gives us information about plane wave packets that propagate away from @xmath9 . in simple words , the cross - covariance at time lag @xmath7 tells us about the position of a wave packet , a time @xmath7 after it has left @xmath9 . in the rest of the paper we fix the distance between @xmath9 and the center of the sunspot at @xmath14  mm . since @xmath15 , where @xmath16  mm is the dominant wavelength ,",
    "the sunspot is in the far field of @xmath9 .    for any particular choice of orientation of @xmath9 ,",
    "the computed cross - covariance is very noisy .",
    "thus the need for some spatial averaging .",
    "let us pick a reference great circle coincident with the meridian at a distance @xmath17  mm eastward of the center of the sunspot .",
    "because sunspot ar9787 is almost rotationally invariant around its center , we can compute many equivalent cross - covariance functions corresponding to many different directions of the incoming wavepacket , derotate these about the center of the sunspot so that they match the reference cross - covariance , and average them to reduce the noise .",
    "we have performed this averaging over all the directions of the incoming wavevectors , with a fine sampling of 1@xmath18 .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig.obs ] , this enables us to reach a very good signal - to - noise level .",
    "we use the ideal mhd equations linearized about an arbitrary , inhomogeneous , magnetized atmosphere . we assume a local cartesian geometry defined by horizontal coordinates @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and the vertical coordinate @xmath21 increases upwards . the level @xmath22 is assumed to correspond to the photosphere , as defined in model s @xcite . under the assumptions that gravitational acceleration ( @xmath23 ) is constant and that there is no background steady flow , the equation governing",
    "the wave - induced displacement vector @xmath24 is ( _ e.g. _  ) @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the linearized force acting on a fluid element ( first order in @xmath24 ) . in this paper",
    "the subscript @xmath27 variables represent the steady inhomogeneous background atmosphere and the primed quantities represent the wave - induced perturbations . in the above equation , the density , pressure , magnetic field , and electric current are denoted by the symbols @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "the system is closed by the following relations that define @xmath32 in terms of @xmath24 : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the background sound speed .    whilst we have employed ideal mhd ,",
    "the waves on the sun are strongly attenuated , presumably as a result of scattering off the time - dependent granulation .",
    "empirically , a solar mode with horizontal wavevector @xmath35 decays as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the e - folding lifetime at wavenumber @xmath38 . introducing @xmath39 as the wave velocity , for each horizontal fourier mode we write @xmath40 in the above equations",
    ", any function @xmath41 refers to the spatial fourier transform of @xmath42 . for @xmath43",
    "the system is damped .",
    "the eigenstates , pairs of @xmath44 , are independent of @xmath45 , although the eigenvalues are naturally affected .",
    "this is the advantage of this approach .",
    "the attenuation that we have implemented acts only in the time domain and is suitable for our purpose , although in the sun attenuation is more complicated .",
    "an alternate way of introducing this phenomenological time attenuation would have been to perform the ideal calculation and then impose the decay in the time domain _ post - facto _ after the calculation has ended .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the _ f _ modes ( solar - surface gravity waves ) , for which the attenuation has been measured to be @xmath46 where @xmath47  @xmath48hz and @xmath49 is a reference wavenumber @xcite .",
    "we use a modified version of the slim code which is , apart from the modifications discussed below , described in .",
    "the code has been tested against analytic solutions  some of these tests are also described in detail in .",
    "the present code includes two absorbing layers at the top and the bottom of the box . in the top layer above the temperature minimum",
    "we heavily damp the waves and systematically reduce the effect of the lorentz force .",
    "this layer only affects waves which have escaped through the photosphere .",
    "likewise the bottom layer damps the waves that propagate downwards .",
    "the purpose of both layers is to minimize the effects of the boundaries which would otherwise artificially reflect the waves .",
    "an additional change has been to introduce the mode attenuation described in section  [ subsec.eqs ] .",
    "since we use a semi - spectral scheme the implementation was straightforward .",
    "the scheme uses finite differences in the vertical direction , with 558 uniformly spaced grid points sampled at @xmath50  km . in the horizontal direction we use a fourier decomposition with 200 modes in the @xmath19 direction and only 50 in the @xmath20 .",
    "the spatial sampling is @xmath51  mm and @xmath52  mm .",
    "this seemingly low resolution is satisfactory because neither the initial wave - packet nor the sunspot has any significant power at short wavelengths .",
    "the size of the simulation box is @xmath53  mm long ( @xmath19-coordinate ) , @xmath54  mm across ( @xmath20-coordinate ) and @xmath55  mm in depth ( @xmath56  mm below the photosphere ) .",
    "a typical run , such as the one from section  [ sec.waveform ] , takes approximately 14 days on a single cpu core .",
    "our aim is to model the propagation of waves through the solar atmosphere in such a way as to allow a direct comparison with the observations .",
    "the most direct way of proceeding would be to use an existing solar - like atmosphere such as that of model s @xcite .",
    "this most direct approach is however unavailable when considering the full evolution of wavepackets using numerical codes because both the solar and model s atmospheres are convectively unstable .",
    "wave propagation through unstable atmospheres is difficult to study numerically because any numerical noise in the unstable modes grows exponentially and eventually dominates the numerical solution .",
    "the problem is then to stabilize the atmosphere whilst leaving it as solar - like as possible , at least in terms of the nature of the waves propagating through it .    the convective instability is easily understood by reference to equation  ( [ eqn : energy ] ) .",
    "we imagine a small vertical displacement of a blob of plasma , and assume it is evolving slowly enough that it is in pressure balance with its surroundings .",
    "this implies @xmath57 and hence @xmath58 .",
    "for a vertically stratified atmosphere , this becomes @xmath59 .",
    "the atmosphere is convectively unstable if an upward displacement ( @xmath60 ) corresponds to a region of lowered density ( @xmath61 ) ; in such a case the fluid parcel is buoyant and accelerates upwards .",
    "the atmosphere is convectively stable when @xmath62 and @xmath63 have the same sign , requiring @xmath64 , equivalently @xmath65    we have the freedom to modify any combination of @xmath66 , @xmath34 , or @xmath67 in order to satisfy equation  ( [ eqn : stability ] ) .",
    "it is somewhat natural to regard these three quantities as being related through an equation of state or through the constraint that the atmosphere be hydrostatic , however neither of these relationships is necessary in terms of the properties of the propagating waves .",
    "we choose @xmath66 , @xmath34 , and @xmath67 so that the wave speed is solar - like .",
    "changing the sound speed would obviously have a major impact on the propagation of sound waves , and hence we have chosen to keep @xmath34 unchanged .",
    "varying @xmath67 would have the effect of varying the distribution of the kinetic energy density of the different modes as a function of height , which would significantly change the sensitivity of wave packets to inhomogeneities ; so we have also kept @xmath67 fixed .",
    "thus we choose @xmath66 so that @xmath68 where @xmath69 was the pressure distribution of the unstable atmosphere .",
    "notice that @xmath70 is negative so that the factor of @xmath71 does indeed mean that equation  ( [ eqn : stability ] ) is satisfied .",
    "the factor of 0.9 is possibly unnecessary , but does little harm : setting this factor to 1 should create stationary eigenmodes , setting it to @xmath71 introduces internal gravity modes which propagate very slowly .",
    "since we have modified the atmosphere , we need to check whether it supports oscillations that are those of the sun and model s in the absence of a sunspot .",
    "we chose initial conditions consisting of a `` line source '' of the form @xmath72 where @xmath73  mm and @xmath74  km is an arbitrary height below the photosphere .",
    "all other wave perturbations , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 being zero at @xmath78 .",
    "this disturbance encompasses many different modes allowing several ridges of the dispersion diagram to emerge .",
    "figure  [ fig : k_omega ] directly compares these ridges with the eigenfrequencies of model s ( a.c .",
    "birch , private communication ) .",
    "the _ f _ modes and the acoustic modes p@xmath79 , p@xmath80 , and p@xmath81 lie where they are expected for @xmath82 .",
    "it is also to be noted that there is a very low amplitude ridge ( not visible on the plot ) at frequencies below 1  mhz that corresponds to internal gravity modes , which are not present in the sun .",
    "they are an artifact of having made the system convectively stable as explained above , but they can be safely ignored .",
    "the simulations and model s eigenfrequencies differ strongly at wavenumbers less than @xmath83 .",
    "this difference is due to the fact that our computational domain extends to only 12  mm below the solar surface .",
    "we have not tested a deeper box because the _ f _ , _ p_@xmath79 , and _ p_@xmath80 modes look satisfactory in the range of wavelengths we are interested in ( @xmath84 ) .      in this section",
    "we will describe the sunspots that we have embedded in our atmosphere .",
    "we begin by noting that we embed the sunspot in the atmosphere before we stabilize it , in order to get the correct sound speed and density structures .",
    "we use @xmath69 to denote the pressure of the atmosphere _ before _ it has been stabilized as described above .",
    "the sunspot is modeled by an axisymmetric magnetic field @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the horizontal radial distance from the sunspot axis . within the part of the atmosphere described by model s , the magnetic field is made hydrostatic in a standard way , by calculating the lorentz force @xmath87 and noting that the horizontal force balance then requires a horizontal pressure gradient : @xmath88 .",
    "since @xmath69 is unaffected by the spot at large distances , we can integrate from infinity towards the center of the spot to find @xmath66 .",
    "having thus found @xmath89 we can find @xmath67 by the constraint of vertical force balance . in this case the gravitational force needs to balance both the vertical component of the lorentz force as well as that of the pressure gradient . in principle given @xmath67 and @xmath66 the saha - boltzmann equations need to be solved to obtain the first adiabatic exponent ( @xmath90 ) and the sound speed ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "however for the purposes of this paper we have assumed that @xmath90 is a function of @xmath21 only and is unaffected by the sunspot .",
    "this assumption will be relaxed in future studies .",
    "the procedure thus outlined can always be applied , however in some cases the results will involve negative pressures or densities .",
    "such solutions are of course unphysical and indicate that no hydrostatic solution exists for the given magnetic configuration and quiet - sun pressure stratification .",
    "the problem typically arises in the very upper layers of the box when the magnetic pressure is large .",
    "for example a purely vertical flux tube with a magnetic pressure @xmath91 can not be in hydrostatic balance in an atmosphere with external pressure @xmath92 . in practice",
    "the sun rapidly evolves to almost force - free field configurations above the solar surface .",
    "the role of the lorentz force in structuring the atmosphere in the low-@xmath93 region is thus artificial as well as being responsible for the lack of equilibrium .",
    "it is also dynamically of minor importance to the waves since it is above both the acoustic cut - off and the layer where the acoustic and alfvn wave speeds become equal .",
    "we have therefore adopted the approach (  .",
    "nordlund , in the context of realistic photospheric magnetoconvection simulations of active regions , private communication ) of scaling the lorentz force in this region when constructing the background atmosphere .",
    "the scaling factor was chosen to be @xmath94 $ ] , where @xmath95 is the quiet - sun pressure in the absence of the spot .",
    "this scaling factor works , although a more conservative scaling will be tested in the future .    above the model s atmosphere ,",
    "the density and pressure fall rapidly and hydrostatic balance requires an extreme scaling of the lorentz force .",
    "however since we are not aiming to realistically model waves that reach these heights ( we only want to damp them ) this is acceptable . instead of requiring force balance in this purely artificial region ,",
    "we have chosen to put @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the top of the model s atmosphere and @xmath98 is the pressure stratification of the system in the absence of the spot ( the quiet - sun value ) .",
    "the density was treated similarly .    in this paper",
    "we follow , , and amongst others in concentrating on axisymmetric self - similar solutions . for this class of models , the vertical component of the magnetic field",
    "is assumed to satisfy @xmath99 where the functions @xmath100 and @xmath101 satisfy @xmath102 but are otherwise arbitrary functions , and @xmath103 is a scalar measure of the vertical - field strength at the surface .",
    "the usual practice @xcite , which we adopt in this paper , is to assume @xmath100 is a gaussian , @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the half - width at half - maximum .",
    "we chose @xmath106  mm to correspond to the observed value for sunspot ar9787 , since @xmath105 is the half - width at half - maximum of the model sunspot at the surface .",
    "the value of @xmath105 is fixed throughout this paper . for the function @xmath101 we chose the exponential function @xmath107 with @xmath108 mm .",
    "this choice is rather arbitrary and will certainly be varied in the near future . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on varying @xmath103 , the peak magnetic field at the surface .",
    "having thus prescribed the formula for @xmath109 , we determine @xmath110 by the requirement that @xmath111 .",
    "once we have such a hydrostatic solution , we adjust the pressure everywhere to make it convectively stable in the manner described above .",
    "in this section we want to compare the observed _",
    "f_-mode cross - covariance from ar9787 and the simulations .",
    "the computational domain is @xmath112  mm@xmath113  mm , @xmath114  mm@xmath115  mm , and @xmath116  mm@xmath117  mm .",
    "the sunspot axis is @xmath118 .",
    "the relationship of the computational box to the observations is shown by the white rectangle in figure  [ fig.obs ] .      in this section",
    "we discuss the choice of the initial conditions for the simulation .",
    "the aim is to allow a direct comparison between the simulated wave field ( section  [ sec.code ] ) and the observed cross - covariance function ( section  [ sec.xc ] ) . since the observed cross - covariance uses the @xmath21 component of the wave velocity as input data , we choose to use @xmath119 from the simulations for the comparison ( this is also in accordance with a deeper interpretation of the cross - covariance , see ) .",
    "the vertical component of velocity of any _",
    "f_-mode wave packet propagating in the @xmath120 direction in a horizontally homogeneous atmosphere is of the form @xmath121 where @xmath122 are complex amplitudes , and @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the _ f_-mode eigenfunction and eigenfrequency at wavenumber @xmath125 .",
    "we introduced the reference coordinate @xmath126 , where @xmath14  mm is defined in the previous section as the distance between @xmath127 and the sunspot .",
    "given the evolution equations  ( [ eq.e1 ] ) and  ( [ eq.e2 ] ) , this wave packet is uniquely determined by the initial conditions @xmath128 thus our problem is reduced to fixing the amplitudes @xmath122 . in this study ,",
    "the amplitudes @xmath122 are real ( all waves are in phase at @xmath129 and @xmath78 ) and are shown in figure  [ fig : obs_spectra ] .",
    "this choice was simply the result of requiring that the simulated @xmath130 and the cross - covariance look approximately the same , in the far field and in the absence of the sunspot . as will be shown in the next section",
    ", this spectrum of wavenumbers is sufficiently accurate for the present study .",
    "a more systematic analysis is planned .",
    "one important difficulty that arises is the existence of background solar noise which is not easy to model and has been ignored in equation  ( [ eq.vz ] ) .",
    "first we consider a sunspot model with @xmath131  kg .",
    "the simulation enables us to understand what happens below the solar surface .",
    "the theory of the interaction of solar waves with sunspots had been developed using ray theory and two - dimensional numerical simulations ( _ e.g. _  ; ) .",
    "we find what appears to be very similar physics in our three - dimensional simulations : the strong `` absorption '' of the _ f _ modes is consistent with partial conversion of the incoming waves into slow magnetoacoustic waves which propagate along the field lines .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ fig : modeconversion1 ] .",
    "the downward propagating slow magnetoacoustic modes experience a decrease in their speed as they propagate downwards and are therefore shifted to increasingly short wavelengths .",
    "mode conversion is a very robust feature of this type of simulation .",
    "we note that the slow magnetoacoustic waves are much easier to see in the @xmath19-component of wave velocity than in @xmath119 , which is why figure  [ fig : modeconversion1 ] shows the former .",
    "since we are strongly damping short wavelengths , these magneto - acoustic modes rapidly decay .",
    "any upward propagating wave encounters the damping buffer situated above the photosphere and is also damped . in principle",
    "this decay is unphysical in both instances , however since neither the downward nor upward propagating waves return to the surface this is not undesirable .      in this section",
    "we compare the simulated @xmath119 at @xmath22 with the observed cross - covariance .",
    "we emphasize that at the moment this comparison is not expected to be appropriate in the immediate vicinity of the sunspot .",
    "figure  [ fig : simvobs1 - 3 ] shows such a comparison between simulations and observations for times @xmath132  minutes , @xmath133  minutes and @xmath134  minutes .",
    "the peak field strength used in this simulation was @xmath131  kg and the radius @xmath106  mm .",
    "the comparison appears to be very good at time @xmath134  minutes , at which time the wavepacket has completely traversed the sunspot . at this time , all aspects of the waveform would appear to have been approximately reproduced by the simulation : amplitudes ( including `` absorption '' ) , phases , and spatial spectrum .",
    "the match appears to be less good for @xmath132  minutes ; this will be discussed below .    to be more precise , however ,",
    "the match between the simulations and observations must be better quantified . in order to reduce the observational noise ,",
    "we have averaged the cross - covariance function in the @xmath20-direction over two bands .",
    "both bands , shown in figure  [ fig.bandcartoon ] , are @xmath135  mm wide in the @xmath20-direction .",
    "the bands are labeled a and b and centered around @xmath136 and @xmath137  mm .",
    "band a is centered on the spot , while band b acts as a reference .",
    "the simulations are averaged in the same manner for comparison with the observations .    in figure",
    "[ fig : bands ] we have plotted both the simulation ( @xmath119 , thick red lines ) and the observed cross - covariance ( @xmath138 , thin bluelines ) . in the top panels we compare the wave propagation at the edge of the computational box , _",
    "i.e._in band b. this part of the wave is little affected by the sunspot and the match between the simulation and observation is quite good since the initial amplitude spectrum @xmath122 was chosen accordingly . in the lower panels of figure  [ fig : bands ]",
    "we see the results for the waves passing through the spot , _ i.e._band a.",
    "first we notice that the wave amplitude is remarkably well reproduced in the simulations , meaning that the observed wave `` absorption '' is consistent with mode conversion . for @xmath134  minutes ,",
    "after the waves have crossed the sunspot , there is no appreciable phase shift between the simulation and the observations .",
    "the match , however , is somewhat worse at @xmath132  minutes and there is an obvious phase shift between the two wave forms with the observations lagging behind the simulations . given the value of the phase shift , we suspect that it is due to the effect of the moat flow .",
    "the moat flow is a horizontal outflow from the sunspot , which we have measured by tracking the small moving magnetic features .",
    "the observed moat velocity ( averaged over nine days ) has a peak value of @xmath139  ms@xmath2 at a distance of 25  mm from the center of the sunspot and vanishes at a distance of @xmath140  mm .",
    "the solar waves moving through the flow are first slowed down ( against the flow ) and later sped up again ( with the flow ) .",
    "we have not modeled this effect yet .",
    "it is reassuring , however , to see that the doppler shift caused by the moat appears to have disappeared at @xmath134  minutes .",
    "reiterating , it appears that , by using numerical simulations , seismic signatures can be followed through their passage across the spot .",
    "the solutions shown thus far have been for a model sunspot with a peak vertical field strength @xmath131  kg at the surface @xmath22 .",
    "the match is good , which raises the question of whether other field strengths would match as well .",
    "the answer to this question can be seen in figures  [ fig : b0_study_bands ] where we show the comparison between the simulations and observations for different field strengths , @xmath141  kg and @xmath142  kg .",
    "the comparison is made some time after the wave packet has passed through the sunspot , so the issue of the moat flow does not arise . at this stage",
    "we restrict ourselves to commenting that qualitatively the match is best , in phase and amplitude , for @xmath131  kg ; for the other values of @xmath103 there is an apparent phase mismatch along @xmath136 and the amplitude of that part of the wave passing through the spot is not sufficiently damped .",
    "the quantification of the `` goodness of fit '' between the simulation and observations , which will allow a more accurate determination of the field strength , will be the subject of a future study .",
    "we have performed three - dimensional mhd simulations of waves propagating through sunspot models .",
    "the computations are set up in such a way as to allow comparing observed cross - covariances ( except in the immediate vicinity of the sunspot ) .",
    "the parameters of the sunspot model can be chosen in such a way that its helioseismic signature is in good agreement with helioseismic observations of sunspot ar9787 .",
    "a qualitative study using _ f _ modes has enabled us to place a constraint , @xmath143  kg , on the sunspot s near - surface field strength .",
    "the remaining differences reflect real differences between the model and the observed sunspot , such as the moat flow .    the model atmosphere that we have constructed also supports _ p _ modes with a dispersion relation that is very close to that of the sun .",
    "obviously , the _ p _ modes in combination with the _ f _ modes should enable us to place more substantial constraints on the subsurface structure of the sunspot .",
    "in particular , it should be possible to simultaneously constrain the magnetic field strength @xmath103 , the sunspot radius @xmath105 , and the magnetic field inclination ( controlled by the parameter @xmath144 ) .",
    "of course , the parametric sunspot model that we have considered in this paper is just one particular model : we plan to consider other types of sunspot models in the future .",
