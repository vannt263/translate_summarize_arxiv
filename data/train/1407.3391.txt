    "the high sn rate in starburst galaxies implies high cr emissivities , so they are predicted to be bright gamma - ray sources ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the gamma - ray luminosity of starbursts depends not only on the cr intensity , but also on the conversion efficiency of cr proton energy into pionic gamma - rays .",
    "this efficiency in turn depends on the ratio of the timescale of pion production to the escape time of protons .",
    "protons escape by advection in galactic winds or by diffusion .",

    "we search for high - energy gamma - ray emission from the above 7 galaxies using the 68 month fermi / lat data .",

    "they have very high star formation rate ( sfr ) in concentrated regions .",

    "then we perform the maximum likelihood analysis again to refine the spectral parameters of the sources within the roi and the diffuse sources using the _ gtlike_. binned likelihood analysis was also performed to verify the results .      a significant gamma - ray excess with ts of 30.8 ( corresponding to a detection significance @xmath125.5@xmath13 )",
    "was found at the best - fit gamma - ray position ( r.a . ,",
    "decl.)=(94.55@xmath9,78.30@xmath9 ) .",
    "this position is consistent with the core of ngc  2146 , the nearest lirg galaxy .",

    "this result unambiguously confirms an earlier , marginally significant excess ( ts@xmath1420 ) in the direction of ngc  2146 reported in ack12 .",
    "the 0.2 - 100  gev spectrum of ngc  2146 is best described by a power law with @xmath11=2.1@xmath150.2 and a photon flux of @xmath16=(1.1@xmath150.5)@xmath17  @xmath18s@xmath19 .",
    "the localization and spectral results of the likelihood analysis are summarized in table [ position ] .",
    "we also performed an additional maximum likelihood analysis by dividing the energy range 0.2100  gev into six energy bins , and the spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ splc ] .",
    "we test alternative associations for the gamma - ray excess besides ngc  2146 in the crates catalog  @xcite of flat - spectrum radio sources ( fsrqs ) , veron - cetty catalog of quasars & agn  @xcite and the candidate gamma - ray blazar survey catalog , cgrabs  @xcite . in the vicinity of ngc  2146",
    ", the only possible gamma - ray emitting object is the fsrq crates  j061758@xmath20781552 ( also named cgrabs  j0617@xmath207816 with redshift of 1.43  @xcite ) , which is 0.04@xmath9 away from best - fit gamma - ray position .",
    "we searched for gamma - ray flux variability by creating a 7-month - per - bin light curve of the photon flux @xmath21 mev arriving from within a circular region of 10@xmath9 in radius centered on the best - fit gamma - ray position , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ splc ] . measuring the goodness - of - fit of the light curve using the average flux over the years",
    "gives a reduced @xmath22 of 0.84 with 7 degrees of freedom , while upper limits were not included .",
    "lack of variability is consistent with a starburst galaxy origin , while fsrqs with such a low variability in gamma - rays is rare among lat blazars .",
    "the photon index @xmath23 also agree with that of other gamma - ray detected star - forming galaxies in ack12 , whereas the mean photon index of lat - detected fsrqs is @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "therefore , based on the gamma - ray spectrum and light curve , we conclude that the gamma - ray excess is dominantly contributed by ngc  2146 , although a small contribution by crates  j061758@xmath20781552 can not be formally excluded .",
    "four more sources with significant gamma - ray excesses were found in the vicinity of m51(ts=29.9 ) , ngc 1365(ts=44.4 ) , arp 220(ts=52.2 ) and m83(59.1 ) ; however , the best - fit positions are all far from the core of the corresponding galaxies , i.e , the angular separation is larger than @xmath25 , c.f . , table  [ position ] .",
    "we therefore explored possible candidate sources for those gamma - ray excess within @xmath25 .",
    "the gamma - ray excess next to m51 likely comes from sdss  j13261@xmath204754 , with an angular separation of 0.13@xmath9 between them , which is smaller than @xmath25 .",
    "ngc  1365 .",
    "the gamma - ray excess is likely associated with pks  0335@xmath26364 , a strong radio quasar , with an angular separation of 0.07@xmath9 between them .",
    "arp  220 . both crates  j153246 + 234400 ( a fsrq ) and sdss  j15323 + 2333 ( a seyfert 2 galaxy at @xmath27=0.047 )",
    "may contribute to the gamma - ray excess since their angular separations are just 0.16@xmath9 and 0.14@xmath9 , respectively .",
    "we further constructed an annual light curve of the gamma - ray emission and found a significant variability ( a factor of 4 between the highest and lowest annual flux ) in this gamma - ray excess .",
    "we therefore conclude that the gamma - ray emission more likely comes from the fsrq crates  j153246 + 234400 .",
    "the possible source contributes to the gamma - ray excess is ms 13326 - 2935 , a blazar in veron - cetty catalogue ( also named 2e 3100 ) , which is 0.04@xmath9 away from the best - fit position .",
    "the result is consistent with  @xcite , where a gamma - ray excess compatible with 2e 3100 with ts=30.1 is found .",
    "the maximum likelihood analysis results of all the 7 starburst galaxies in this study are shown in table  [ core ] .",
    "we also perform additional maximum likelihood analysis in the energy range from 100  mev to 100  gev , such that our results can readily be compared with upper limits reported in ack12 .",
    "all upper limits from this study are smaller than the corresponding ones reported in ack12 , the latter using a smaller data set . note that , for the four star - forming galaxies , m51 , ngc  1365 , arp  220 and m83 , we calculated upper limits of their gamma - ray flux by adding a point source at the best - fit position to build a new source background model .",
    "the gamma - ray emission of starburst galaxies could , in principle , be produced by bremsstrahlung and inverse - compton emission of the primary or secondary electrons , as well as the pionic decay emission resulted from cr interactions .",
    "detailed calculations have shown that the pionic decay gamma - rays dominate the emission above 100 mev for starburst galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ;  @xcite ) , although leptonic emission is expected to become increasingly important at lower energies .",
    "the total injected cr power in the galaxies scales with the sn rate as snrs are the primary cr accelerators .",
    "following @xcite , we assume that the supernova rate is a constant fraction , @xmath28 , of the star - formation rate ( @xmath29 ) and a fraction of @xmath30 of its kinetic energy @xmath31 is supplied to relativistic protons , thus the total cr power is @xmath32 . assuming that the star - formation rate is related to the total infrared ( ir ) luminosity in 8 - 1000 @xmath33 by @xmath34 , the total cr power is ( see also eq . 5 in @xcite )",
    "@xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 , which depends weakly on the initial mass function @xcite . in the proton calorimeter limit ,",
    "i.e. all the proton energy is lost into secondary pions , the gamma - ray luminosity is directly related to the cr power by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 comes from the fact that only @xmath39 of the proton energy lost goes into neutral pions and we have assumed that the energy in gamma - rays below 0.1 gev is negligible .",
    "then the ratio between the total gamma - ray luminosity and the total infrared luminosity in the calorimeter limit is @xmath40 as has been predicted in @xcite .",
    "we compare the ratio between the observed gamma - ray luminosity and total infrared luminosity of ngc  2146 with this limit ratio in fig.3 ( together with other lat detected galaxies ) and find that ngc  2146 lies close to this calorimeter limit .",
    "thus , we suggest that ngc  2146 is probably a `` proton calorimeter '' .    the proton calorimetry of ngc  2146 can be understood by comparing the collisional energy loss time of cr protons and the escape time @xcite . for a gas density of @xmath41 in the starburst region of ngc  2146  @xcite ,",
    "the collisional energy loss time of cr protons is @xmath42 where the factor 0.5 is inelasticity , and @xmath43 is the inelastic nuclear collision cross section .",
    "if @xmath44 is less than the escape time , then system is a proton calorimeter . cr protons can escape by advection in galactic winds , with a timescale @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the size of the starburst region  @xcite and @xmath47 is the velocity of the galactic wind in ngc  2146  @xcite . comparing eqs.(3)-(4 ) , we expect that cr protons in the starburst region of ngc  2146 should lose a large fraction of their energy before escape , in agreement with the above inferred large calorimetry fraction .",
    "it has been proposed that there is a connection between galaxy star - formation rates and gamma - ray luminosities , motivated by the connections between the star - formation rate , sn rate and cosmic ray power ( e.g.  @xcite ;  @xcite ;  @xcite ;  @xcite ;  @xcite ;  @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "first predicted a far infrared ( fir)gamma - ray correlation in the calorimetric limit for densest starbursts .",
    "ack12 found a quasi - linear scaling relation between gamma - ray luminosity and the total ir luminosity for quiescent galaxies in the local group and nearby starburst galaxies .",
    "we now examine whether ngc  2146 follows this relation .",
    "different from ack12 , we exclude two starbursting seyfert 2 galaxies ngc 1068 and ngc 4945 in the fit in order to have a sample consist purely of star - forming and starburst galaxies .",
    "[ correlation ] shows their gamma - ray luminosities and total ir luminosities(8 - 1000@xmath49 m ) of this sample .",
    "the total ir(8 - 1000@xmath49 m ) luminosities are provided by  @xcite and the gamma - ray luminosities are from  @xcite .",
    "we fit the data with a simple power - law and find the relation @xmath50 with a pearson correlation coefficient being @xmath51 and null hypothesis probability less than @xmath52 , which indicates a tight positive correlation .",
    "the scaling indices between the gamma - ray luminosity and total ir luminosity for this sample is consistent within uncertainties with that obtained in previous works  @xcite . with ngc  2146 , the highest ir luminosity galaxy in this sample , the correlation now extends up to a total ir luminosity of @xmath53 , strengthening the connection between massive star formation and gamma - ray emission of star - forming galaxies .",
    "very high energy ( vhe ) gamma - ray emission has been detected from nearby starburst galaxies m82 and ngc  253 by veritas and hess , respectively @xcite . using the gev flux and the spectrum of ngc  2146 , we can estimate the vhe flux assuming a simple power - law extrapolation .",
    "as can be seen from fig.2 ( left panel ) , the predicted energy flux is @xmath54 at tev energies , which is close to the detection sensitivity of veritas and should be detectable by future instruments such as cta , lhaaso and etc .",
    "note that at a distance of 15.2 mpc , the absorption by extragalactic background light is unimportant for tev photons .",
    "proton - proton collisions in starbursts not only produce neutral pions , but also produce charged pions , which then decay and produce neutrinos .",
    "@xcite argued that supernova remnants in starburst galaxies accelerate cr protons and produce high - energy neutrinos .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite further made an explicit connection between the expected diffuse gamma - ray background and the diffuse high - energy neutrino background from starbursts since pion production links the two directly .",
    "recently , the icecube collaboration reported 37 events ranging from 60tev to 3pev within three years of operation , correspond to a @xmath55 excess over the background atmospheric neutrinos and muons@xcite .",
    "one attractive scenario for this excess is that they are produced by cosmic rays in starburst galaxies@xcite .",
    "but whether neutrinos in starburst galaxies can extend to sub - pev / pev energies is uncertain , given that normal supernova remnants are usually believed to accelerate protons only to @xmath56 .",
    "it was suggested that hypernova remnants in starburst galaxies , by virtue of their fast ejecta , are able to accelerate protons to @xmath57 pev @xcite and produce sub - pev / pev neutrinos @xcite .",
    "future observations of vhe gamma - ray emission of starburst galaxies extending to @xmath58 tev would be able to pin down the starburst origin of the sub - pev / pev neutrinos .",
    "by searching for high - energy gamma - ray emission from the 7 best candidate galaxies for lat detection beyond the local group ( ack12 ) , we found significant high - energy gamma - ray emission above 100 mev from a source spatially coincident with ngc  2146 , the nearest lirg galaxy .",
    "the significance of the detection is about 5.5 @xmath13 .",
    "this is the first time that a lirg galaxy has been detected by fermi / lat .",
    "the high gamma - ray luminosity suggests that cosmic ray protons in ngc  2146 convert most of their energy into secondary pions , so ngc  2146 is a proton calorimeter .",
    "it is also found that ngc  2146 extends the quasi - linear scaling relation between the gamma - ray luminosities and total ir luminosities of star - forming galaxies to a higher luminosity , thus strengthening the connection between massive star formation and gamma - ray emission of star - forming galaxies .",
