    "effective field theories have been developed in recent years to solve the nuclear many - body problem . in the present work ,",
    "we consider one of these theories , proposed by furnstahl , serot , and tang ( fst ) @xcite , and extend their methodology to the case of single @xmath0-hypernuclei .",
    "specifically , the phenomena of interest here are ground - state ( gs ) binding energies , densities , single - particle spectra , and particle - hole splittings of select single @xmath0-hypernuclei .    fst develop a self - consistent framework for constructing an effective lagrangian that incorporates the principles of both quantum mechanics and special relativity , the underlying symmetries of qcd , and the nonlinear realization of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "as this is a low - energy theory , the appropriate low lying hadrons are used as degrees of freedom . in order to make any meaningful calculation ,",
    "the lagrangian , which in principle contains an infinite number of terms , must be truncated in some way .",
    "naive dimensional analysis ( nda ) @xcite and relativistic mean field theory ( rmft ) @xcite provide a formalism in which higher order terms are , in general , successively smaller ; this allows for a systematic expansion , and consequently a meaningful truncation , in the effective lagrangian . here",
    "fst utilize relativistic hartree theory to reduce the many - body equations to single - particle equations .",
    "the free parameters in the effective lagrangian are fixed via least - squares fits to experimental data from ordinary nuclei along the valley of stability .",
    "these fits are conducted at various levels of truncation in the underlying lagrangian @xcite .",
    "once the values of these parameters are known , this lagrangian can be used to predict other properties of ordinary nuclei .",
    "one example which demonstrates the predictive power of this method is its application to the study of nuclei far from stability @xcite .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) is a theoretical framework which allows one to calculate the gs properties of many - body systems without carrying around all the baggage contained in the many - particle wave functions @xcite .",
    "two points are of interest here .",
    "first , if the expectation value of the hamiltonian is considered as a functional of the density , the exact gs density can be determined by minimizing the energy functional .",
    "second , one only needs to solve a series of self - consistent , single - particle equations with classical fields , instead of many - body equations with quantum fields @xcite . in other words ,",
    "kohn - sham theory is formally equivalent to relativistic hartree theory .",
    "consequently , the problem is now reduced to determining the correct form of the energy functional , which follows from the appropriate lagrangian .",
    "the full interacting lagrangian of fst gives an appropriate energy functional and , as a result , dft provides an underlying theoretical justification for this approach .",
    "hadronic effective lagrangians using mft have been developed in the literature to describe hypernuclei .",
    "early models containing only the lowest order terms required much weaker meson couplings to the @xmath0 than to the nucleons to achieve success @xcite , particularly in the weak spin - orbit interaction .",
    "later , it was suggested that large meson couplings to the @xmath0 consistent with @xmath3 were possible if the lagrangian was extended to include tensor couplings @xcite .",
    "it turns out the spin - orbit splitting is very sensitive to the size of the tensor coupling to the vector field .",
    "the approach of fst has also been applied to strange hadronic matter @xcite .",
    "more recently , effective theories consistent with @xmath4 have been constructed @xcite .",
    "another model of interest uses strangeness changing response functions to calculate the spectra of @xmath5 and @xmath6 ; the resulting gs particle - hole splittings are small @xcite .",
    "other studies include models that couple the mesons self - consistently to the quarks within the baryons @xcite and a density dependent relativistic hadronic field theory @xcite .",
    "the following studies have attempted to fit potentials to the hyperon - nucleon interaction .",
    "experimental data has been analyzed to obtain a nonlocal and density - dependent @xmath0-nucleus potential @xcite .",
    "global optical potentials for @xmath0 scattering off nuclei were developed @xcite .",
    "the hypernuclear mass dependence of the binding energies is reproduced by a @xmath0 moving in a woods - saxon potential @xcite .",
    "the nijmegen group has developed y - n potentials based on the assumption of @xmath3 symmetry @xcite ; this fixes the baryon - meson coupling constants from n - n scattering fits .",
    "similarly , potentials were constructed by the julich group assuming @xmath7 symmetry @xcite .",
    "calculations of hypernuclei using these nijmegen or julich potentials include @xcite .",
    "comparable g - matrix calculations with a @xmath7 quark - model baryon - baryon interaction @xcite and skyrme - like hyperon - nucleon potentials @xcite have also been investigated .",
    "other recent approaches include using the fermi hypernetted chain method @xcite and using a quark model with one boson exchange potentials @xcite .",
    "many of these studies achieve a good deal of success .",
    "however , the framework of fst is more comprehensive than these approaches as it incorporates directly into a hadronic effective field theory all of the following : special relativity , quantum mechanics , the underlying symmetry structure of qcd , and the nonlinear realization of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry .",
    "furthermore , this methodology is theoretically justified by dft . once all the parameters are fixed",
    ", their lagrangian predicts the gs properties of any ordinary nucleus .",
    "this approach has had great success @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to extend this methodology , with all of its intrinsic strengths , to the strangeness sector , as is done here .    in the present work",
    ", the approach developed by fst is expanded to the region of the strangeness sector that corresponds to @xmath0-hypernuclei with @xmath8 and @xmath9 . to this end",
    ", we include a single , isoscalar @xmath0 field in the theory .",
    "is not explicitly included in the present calculation .",
    "an idea of the possible impact of @xmath10 mixing can be taken from @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that if one views the scalar meson as a two - pion resonance , then the @xmath11 enters implicitly as an intermediate state in our formalism .",
    "] now , a @xmath0-lagrangian is constructed as an additional contribution to the full interacting effective lagrangian of fst , consistent with their methodology . since the @xmath0 is an isoscalar , it does not couple to either a single yukawa pion or the rho meson .",
    "furthermore , we confine our theory to the mesons already included ; thus , the meson lagrangian , which in this approach contains the majority of the complexity , is unaltered .",
    "it has been proposed that a tensor coupling to the vector field be included to reproduce the correct experimental spin - orbit splitting of the p - states in @xmath0-hypernuclei @xcite . as it turns out , such a term is a natural extension of our lagrangian in this framework .",
    "additional higher order terms are also included to better approximate the exact energy functional .",
    "following the methodology of fst , our @xmath0-lagrangian contains a number of free parameters .",
    "the constants in both the nucleon and meson sectors are taken from a fst parameter set corresponding to their full lagrangian .",
    "as before , the remaining unconstrained parameters are fixed here via least - squares fits to a series of experimental data @xcite .",
    "the 10 pieces of data used include six gs binding energies , three s - p shell excitations for the @xmath0 , and the spin - orbit splitting of the p - states in @xmath12 .",
    "the fits are conducted at four different levels of truncation in the @xmath0-lagrangian .",
    "once these parameters are fixed , this lagrangian can be used to predict other properties of single @xmath0-hypernuclei .",
    "one other property that is of interest to calculate here is what we refer to as @xmath1-splittings .",
    "these are gs particle - hole splittings of select single @xmath0-hypernuclei , such as @xmath13 , which have a @xmath0 in the gs and a hole in the last filled nucleon ( proton or neutron ) shell . for these systems , the angular momenta of the @xmath0 and the nucleon hole couple to form a doublet .",
    "the size of these splittings is determined by the difference of two particle - hole matrix elements @xcite .",
    "the effective particle - hole interaction utilized here follows directly from the effective theory of the preceding discussion .",
    "this interaction , to lowest order , is just simple scalar and vector meson exchange @xcite .",
    ", is left for future work .",
    "also , it is worth noting that while the kaon makes no contribution at the mean field level , kaon exchange may play a role in the effective interaction .",
    "some idea of the relative contribution of kaon exchange can be obtained from the nijmegen potentials @xcite .",
    "an investigation of the effect of kaon exchange on the @xmath1-splittings in effective field theory is also left to future work .",
    "[ foot:1 ] ] a simple yukawa spatial dependence is obtained when retardation is neglected in the meson propagators . with this exception ,",
    "the full lorentz structure is maintained @xcite .",
    "for the @xmath0-n case , there is no isovector component to the effective interaction or exchange contribution in the two - body matrix elements . through angular momentum relations @xcite and some algebra ,",
    "the matrix elements are reduced to radial slater integrals . using the hartree wave functions from the @xmath0 single - particle calculations to evaluate the integrals , these matrix elements , and consequently the @xmath14-splitting , can now be fully determined . once the parameters in the @xmath0-lagrangian are known , the effective particle - hole interaction is completely specified in this approach . in the case of @xmath14-splittings in @xmath0-hypernuclei ,",
    "only the spatial part of the vector exchange contributes to the splitting .",
    "predictions are given for the gs doublet splittings of every one of the @xmath0-hypernuclei considered here ; all of the doublets used in the fitting procedure lie within the current experimental error bars on the gs energies .",
    "an upcoming high resolution experiment at jefferson lab will measure the @xmath14-splittings in @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the present calculations provide theoretical predictions for these quantities.@xmath17 non - relativistic calculations of similar particle - hole splittings have been carried out @xcite .",
    "the need for isovector interactions and exchange contributions make calculations of similar splittings in ordinary nuclei far more complicated @xcite . as an example of a comparable system in an ordinary nucleus , and to at least partially calibrate the present approach , the calculation of the @xmath14-splitting in @xmath2",
    "is included here .",
    "comparable systems for ordinary nuclei have also been examined @xcite .    in section [ sec:2 ] ,",
    "we review the methodology of fst and in section [ sec:3 ] , we describe the development of our @xmath0-lagrangian .",
    "the framework for calculating the particle - hole splittings is discussed in section [ sec:4 ] .",
    "the results of the parameter fits , single - particle calculations , and @xmath14-splittings are given in section [ sec:5 ] .",
    "in this section we review the methodology of fst .",
    "they approach the nuclear many - body problem by constructing an effective field theory that retains the underlying symmetries of qcd as well as the principles of both special relativity and quantum mechanics @xcite . at low - energy ,",
    "hadrons are the desired degrees of freedom and the ones which fst use to construct an effective lagrangian .",
    "the nonlinear realization of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry is illustrated through a system of pions , nucleons , and rho mesons .",
    "they incorporate goldstone pions through the field @xmath18        the following boson fields are also incorporated into this framework , the first two of which are isoscalar chiral singlets . a scalar field , @xmath24 , is included to simulate the medium - range nuclear attraction .",
    "next , they incorporate a vector meson , @xmath25 , to reproduce the short - range nuclear repulsion .",
    "lastly , a photon field , @xmath26 , is added to take into consideration the electromagnetic structure of nuclei .    as all possible combinations of the fields , consistent with this framework ,",
    "are included , this lagrangian contains an infinite number of terms . to conduct any meaningful calculation",
    ", this lagrangian needs to be truncated at some level .",
    "fst utilize both nda and rmft to accomplish this .",
    "nda is a framework which identifies all the dimensional factors of a given term .",
    "once these dimensional factors , and some appropriate counting factors , are extracted from a term , the remaining dimensionless constant is of @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "this assumption is known as `` naturalness . ''",
    "rmft states that when the baryon density becomes appropriately large , the sources and meson fields can be replaced by their expectation values ; here , the expectation values of the meson fields are just their classical fields @xcite .",
    "then we notice that while the meson mean fields are large , the ratios of these fields to the chiral symmetry breaking scale , m , are small .",
    "furthermore , the size of derivatives is related to @xmath28 , which is also small compared to m. these effects are shown by @xcite @xmath29        where for a given term @xmath32 is the order , @xmath33 is the number of fermion fields , @xmath34 is the number of non - goldstone bosons , and @xmath35 is the number of derivatives . now",
    "a controlled expansion is performed in which higher order terms are , in general , progressively smaller .",

    "here we have defined @xmath42        terms such as @xmath53 are redundant in this formulation .",
    "this stems from the fact that fst employ meson field redefinitions ; since the parameters are free , they are also just redefined .",
    "a detailed description of how this lagrangian was constructed is presented in @xcite .",
