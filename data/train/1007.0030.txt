    "absorption - line systems in the spectra of high - redshift sources such as qsos and grb afterglows provide opportunities to examine the interstellar gas in galaxies at early cosmic times with samples that are less biased than emission - selected samples .",
    "these techniques have been used to probe the properties of gas clouds at high redshift , where conditions can differ significantly from those in the local universe .",
    "detections of cold molecular gas at high redshift are less common than might be expected ; only about one quarter of dlas show detectable molecular hydrogen ( noterdaeme et  al .",
    "even in grb - dlas , where the sightline pierces deep inside the ism of the host galaxy , molecular gas does not appear often ( tumlinson et  al .",
    "2007 ) , though it has been detected in one system via h@xmath4 and co absorption ( prochaska et  al . 2009 ) .",
    "the opportunity to detect deuterated hydrogen molecules ( hd ) exists in many of these systems where h@xmath4 is seen , and would in principle provide another useful constraint on physical conditions .",
    "hd is fragile , easily photo - dissociated , and is present in the milky way interstellar medium ( ism ) only along reddened sightlines where the absorbing cloud is dense , dusty , and self - shielded .",
    "hd may also be an important gas coolant at low density in low - metallicity galaxies , and so it is important to understand the conditions in which it becomes abundant . in this letter",
    "we report two new detections of hd in high - redshift qso absorption line systems : the sub - dla at @xmath10 toward j2123 - 0500 and the dla at @xmath11 toward fj0812 + 32 .",
    "these systems show h@xmath4 and hd absorption but are otherwise quite different and revealing .",
    "data on j21230500 were obtained with keck / hires in a series of exposures spanning the nights of 17 - 20 aug 2006 .",
    "a complete analysis of the spectrum is presented by milutinovic et al .",

    "we find that the @xmath30 contours extend up to n(0 ) @xmath34 at 99% confidence , well into the range where @xmath33 reaches reasonable physical values of 100 - 200 k. we therefore adopt a fiducial model that has n(1 ) = 17.55 from the m10 profile fit , and n(0 ) = @xmath35 , as shown with the range bar in figure  [ h2contourfig ] .",
    "this latter value splits the difference between the 99% confidence interval on n(0 ) and the line of unphysical @xmath33 , and assigns an error that ranges to these extremes ( point `` 2 '' ) .",

    "since hd has a dipole moment , radiative transitions between @xmath46 and @xmath41 are permitted ( as they are not for symmetric h@xmath4 ) and hd can take on a lower excitation temperature than h@xmath4 even at high density .",

    "( 2009 , hereafter j09 ) .",
    "this system shows six detected hd r(0 ) lines ; the other lines missing from table 1 are blended with other features .",
    "these lines fall onto the flat portion of a single - component cog ( figure  [ hdlinefig2 ] ) , where their column density is only moderately constrained .",
    "however , the effective dopper @xmath18 parameter is well - constrained ; the best fit is @xmath15(hd ) @xmath62 and @xmath63 km  s@xmath14  from the cog .",
    "a profile fit using vpfitrfc / vpfit.html ] obtained @xmath15(hd ) @xmath64 and @xmath65 , as shown in figure 3 .",
    "the column densities of h@xmath4 in this system were also obtained as part of this global profile fit , yielding n(@xmath66 ) = 19.81 , 19.13 , 16.20 , 14.86 , and 13.97 for @xmath67 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , respectively , for @xmath68 n(h@xmath4 ) @xmath69 .",
    "the best - fit doppler @xmath70 was held at @xmath71 km  s@xmath14  for @xmath72 and 1 under the assumption that the bulk of the column density in h@xmath4 coincides with the cold component of carbon and so is thermally broadened at @xmath73 k. these linewidths are consistent with the cog and profile - fitted values for hd at this temperature .",
    "we therefore conclude that the hd in this cloud plausibly arises in the same cold gas component as the cold c and h@xmath4 ( j09 ) .",
    "there is also tentative evidence for hd @xmath46 in this system .",
    "three @xmath46 lines appear as excess absorption in blended profiles of unrelated absorption ; these are werner 0 - 0r(1 ) and lyman 5 - 0r(1 ) and 4 - 0p(1 ) . only the lyman 4 - 0p(1 )",

    "if we use this tentative value for n(1 ) we obtain @xmath75 k , colder than the corresponding c i and h@xmath4 , for which j09 inferred @xmath76 k. as for j2123 - 0500 , we attribute this low excitation temperature to efficient radiative decay between @xmath46 and @xmath41 rather than the gas kinetic temperature .",
    "we are now ready to compare these detections to other known hd - bearing gas .",

    "this hd to h@xmath4 ratio is also well above the galactic disk ratio .",
    "we have plotted two symbols in figure  [ hdplot ] for the dla toward j2123 - 0500 : the open symbol uses the lower cog - fitted measurement for n(h@xmath4 ) , while the filled circle uses the higher profile fitted value (   2 ) .",
    "the error bars on the points express the estimated _ statistical _ noise on each measurement ; the line connecting them shows the larger systematic uncertainty arising from saturation of the h@xmath4 lines . with the higher h@xmath4 column density , the hd to h@xmath4 ratio in this system more closely resembles the other systems and the cosmological ratio of d / h .    our findings in the j2123 - 0500 and fj0812 +",
    "32b systems agree in their hd / h@xmath4 ratio with the other detections , with the striking result that all four high - redshift systems lie both well above the galactic disk value and apparently consistent with the cosmological d / h ratio .",
    "this finding is somewhat puzzling , in light of the diversity in the other properties of these systems . in their analysis of q1232",
    "+ 082 , ivanchik et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) explain this effect by low astration at early times .",
    "these systems show metallicities proxied from s or zn that are between 0.04 @xmath85 and @xmath85 ( as shown in the legend of figure  [ hdplot ] ) .",
    "it is puzzling why the infall of gas undepleted in d would be arranged just so that the primordial d / h ratio is maintained in four such diverse systems .",
    "it is not clear why low astration would be the dominant factor in environments that have already achieved a metallicity comparable to the milky way disk , as it is for three of the systems .",
    "indeed , the consistency of the hd / h2 ratio across the factor of 20 in metallicity spanned by these systems indicates that metallicity is perhaps only a minor factor in determining the abundance of hd .",
    "even with four systems that lie along a narrow band of hd / h@xmath4 ratio well above the galactic ratio , we can not be sure that this is the general pattern of hd / h@xmath4 in high - redshift galaxies .",
    "hd may have gone undetected in other dlas where the galactic ratio would place the hd below detection limits .",
    "our column density sensitivity limits here are n(hd ) @xmath86 @xmath50 , which gives a limit hd/2h@xmath4 @xmath87 for j2123 - 0500 and @xmath88 for fj0812 + 32b , well below the galactic points in the latter case but above them in the former .",
    "though in most published cases the data quality is adequate to detect hd in the ratios seen here , a systematic survey of h@xmath4-bearing dlas might reveal that in some cases a galactic ratio is permitted given the individual detection limits . in light of this `` detection bias '' we can not yet conclude that the anomalous ratios of the four systems known so far are representative of the general pattern at high redshift .",
    "another striking feature of these systems is that their typical molecular fraction is @xmath89 .",
    "the typical value for the galactic disk clouds is up to ten times higher , with most scattering in between @xmath90 = 0.2 and 0.6 ( figure  [ hdplot ] ) . in the galactic disk ,",
    "the hd is believed to occupy only the dense , self - shielded inner regions of the cloud and to be dissociated easily in the low - extinction photodissocation regions surrounding the cloud ( lacour et  al .",
    "2005 ) . by this line of reasoning",
    ", clouds with lower molecular fractions should have more of their hd dissociated and should lie below the galactic disk points rather than above .",
    "this effect is particularly notable for the j2123 - 0500 system , which does not qualify as a dla and has the lowest @xmath91 . the mystery",
    "is then deepened , in the sense that we must explain a higher hd to h@xmath4 ratio than in the milky way in clouds of similar metallicity but lower total molecular abundance .",
    "dust is another factor that may help promote the formation of hd in these systems .",
    "all four of these hd - bearing systems show evidence of dust depletion based on dust - sensitive abundance ratios .",
    "the system toward j2123 - 0500 shows ionization - corrected abundance ratios si and fe depleted by approximately 0.5 dex with respect to s and n ( see table 4 of milutinovic et al . ) .",
    "the f0812 + 32b system shows solar [ s / si ] but [ zn / fe ] and [ cr / zn ] that indicates a high depletion of fe ( j09 ) .",
    "the 2175   dust feature is not detected in either spectrum .",
    "unfortunately , beyond these abunance ratios no more quantitative information has been obtained on the exact dust - to - gas ratios or dust properties of these two systems , so it is not known whether the composition and size distribution of the dust is similar to that of the galactic disks .",
    "we therefore can not correlate the hd properties of these systems against dust in any more detail .    using a master - equation approach , lipshtat , biham , & herbst ( 2004 )",
    "studied the relative formation rates of h@xmath4 and hd under the assumption that d atoms stick to dust grain surfaces for slightly longer than h. they have found that for a certain range of conditions , the total formation rate of hd can rise from @xmath92 to @xmath93 times that of h@xmath4 as the dust temperature rises from @xmath94 k to 20 k. the effect is strongest for small grains with a small count of binding sites to which h and d attach .",
    "since this model describes the formation rates but not the relative photo - dissociation rates ( which are greatly influenced by self - shielding for h@xmath4 and much less so for hd ) , and since it possesses at least three free parameters for density , grain size , and grain temperature , we can not directly use our data to constrain these models .",
    "we can speculate that small grains , the right range of dust temperatures , or both , may together establish the observed molecular abundance ratios seen in these four @xmath0 systems .",
    "however , with the relative rates of h@xmath4 and hd production ranging over a factor of 100 between @xmath95 k and @xmath96 k for a range of grain sizes , it is not clear why the four systems found so far have scatter so closely around the cosmological d / h .",
    "we also compare our hd results against the d / h ratios seen in high - redshift dlas as compiled by pettini et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) , represented by open diamonds in figure  [ hdplot ] .",
    "we note that the d / h measurements are quite precise and show a low scatter consistent with the cmb - derived value . in light of the precision and consistency of these measurements",
    ", it seems unnecessary to rely on hd / h@xmath4 as a measure of cosmological d / h when the chemical influences on hd are so uncertain .    in light of the diversity of these systems in metallicity and molecular fraction , and with the discussion above in mind",
    ", we conclude that the balance of chemical reactions , dust properties , and local conditions are highly uncertain in these systems . following this",
    ", it seems that these systems pose a puzzle about interstellar chemistry more effectively than they solve one about d / h .",
    "if properly understood these systems are likely to be far more revealing of these uncertain chemical and environmental effects than they are of the primordial abundances , which in any case appear well constrained from direct measurements of d / h .",
    "we can hope the discovery of more such systems and additional theoretical work will be able to disentangle these effects and resolve these doubts .",
