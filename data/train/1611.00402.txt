    "supernova ( sn ) explosions represent a key form of stellar feedback in galaxies , and produce copious hot gas in the ism . the sn energy can regulate the ism dynamics and launch galactic outflows @xcite .",
    "one key factor to quantify the efficiency of sn feedback is the energy loading factor ( or `` thermalization factor '' ) , which is the fraction of sn energy that is loaded into the outflows .",

    "a temperature around @xmath3 k is where the cooling curve peaks for metal - enriched gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the ovi @xmath01032 , 1038  doublet is the major coolant around this temperature .",
    "these ovi resonant lines have been observed widely , from the local ism , which provides the first strong evidence of the prevalence of the hot phase in the ism @xcite , to the circumgalactic medium ( cgm ) and even the intergalactic medium ( igm ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the origin of gas around this temperature is not totally clear .",
    "thermal conduction / turbulent mixing at the interface between the hot plasma ( @xmath4 k ) and warm clouds ( @xmath5 k ) @xcite , and cooling from hotter gas @xcite have been suggested as possible mechanisms .    in hydrodynamic simulations of astrophysical systems , the quantity of gas around @xmath3 k can be affected by numerical mixing and diffusion .",
    "depending on the resolution and technique used , hydrodynamic simulations can artificially promote or suppress the mixing and the amount of gas in the warm - hot phase .",
    "for example , the particle - based sph scheme usually exhibits too little mixing , while the mesh - based techniques can have too much mixing @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of this numerical artifact is hard to gauge .",
    "this is a particular issue when multiple phases  with contrasting densities and temperatures  coexist at similar pressures , as is the case for the ism . even without explicitly including thermal conduction ,",
    "gas with intermediate temperature @xmath6 k can show up around the interface between the hot and warm ( or cold ) phases , which is usually not well - resolved .",
    "although higher numerical resolution helps , turbulence may drive the scale of the cold / hot interface down to small length scales and , until the field length is resolved , improved resolution may simply result in more clouds without reducing the amount of material in the interface . because of the high cooling efficiency in this warm - hot phase , it is important to test the simulation cooling rates .",

    "we expect that the non - equilibrium effects will affect the ovi absorption more strongly than emission , since low temperatures would lead to less efficient collision and excitation .",

    "note that the surface brightness reported in that paper is for the 1038   line . to get the emission for ovi 1032  , we have applied two corrections : ( i ) a factor of 2 increase due to the relative intensity of 1032   and 1038 ; ( ii ) a factor of 2 increase to account for gas from both sides of the disk , since only the redshifted part is observed as emission .",
    "we have also scaled the emission to the solar abundance as in this paper .",
    "@xcite calculated o / h using two methods , which differ by a factor of 3 or so ( see their table 1 ) .",
    "the two hollow triangles in the plot correspond to these two different o / h values .",
    "but note that the observed surface brightness is still likely to be a lower limit of the real emission for several reasons .",
    "first , the aperture of the cos spectrograph is 2.5 arcsec in diameter , corresponding to a physical scale of roughly 9.4 kpc at the galaxy s redshift ( 0.235 ) .",
    "the surface brightness of the 1038  line is assumed to be uniform inside the aperture , but the star forming region is actually very compact  only about 1 kpc across ( as seen from h@xmath47 ) .",
    "thus the actual surface brightness in this starbursting region is probably higher .",
    "second , the 1038   line can be partially blended with the nearby c ii absorption .",
    "additionally , attenuation by dust in the host galaxy , especially in the disk , can also lower the emission .",
    "based on these arguments , the reported emission intensity is probably a lower limit .",
    "also , we note that the cgm probably does not contribute much to the surface brightness in this measurement , since for j1156 , the ovi emission in the halo is observed , with an intensity much lower than the central region .",
    "apart from j1156 , another galaxy , haro 11 , turns out to be very similar @xcite .",
    "@xcite also compare j1156 with the stacked spectra of other starbursting galaxies from archival data , and find an ovi emission comparable to j1156 .    for high",
    ", we can not yet draw a firm conclusion about whether our results are consistent with the ( very limited ) observations .",
    "there can be agreement if , for the very high  cases , the actual emission is above the observed value for the reasons discussed above , and/or the ovi emission from the simulations increases more slowly for higher , which we do not cover in our simulations .    finally , the roughly linear scaling of the ovi surface brightness with   implies that the cooling rate from ovi is an approximately constant fraction of the sne heating .",
    "we find this fraction to be around 0.5% , including both 1032  and 1038  .",
    "therefore cooling from ovi is not an important source of energy loss .",
    "the predicted ovi column density ( across the whole z - direction ) , as a function of  , is shown in figure [ f : novi ] ( purple stars ) .",
    "the column density is averaged over the x - y plane .",
    "the error bar indicates the time variation .",
    "the correlation of with  is positive but the dependence is weak , with a power - law index of 0.19 . for four orders of magnitude span in , only differs by a factor of 6 . for the solar neighborhood ,",
    "we show the observed value as in @xcite ( orange box ) , with a factor of 2 increase applied to include ovi from both sides of the galaxy disk ; the vertical range of the box indicates the statistical variation of , and the horizontal range denotes the uncertainty of .",
