    ", they have cumulatively reached a model independent evidence at 9.3@xmath3 c.l . for the presence of dm particles in the galactic halo by exploiting the dm annual modulation signature @xcite .",
    "recently the results obtained by investigating the presence of possible diurnal variation in the low - energy _ single - hit _ scintillation events collected by dama / libra  phase1 ( 1.04 ton @xmath0 yr exposure ) have been released and analysed in terms of a dm second order model - independent effect due to the earth diurnal rotation around its axis @xcite . in particular",
    ", the data were analysed using the sidereal time referred to greenwich , often called gmst .",
    "no diurnal variation with sidereal time has been observed at the reached level of sensitivity , which was not yet adequate to point out the effect searched for there . in the present paper",
    "those experimental data are analysed in terms of an effect  named `` _ earth shadow effect _ ''  which could be expected for dm candidate particles inducing nuclear recoils ; this effect would be induced by the variation  during the day  of the earth thickness crossed by the dm particle in order to reach the experimental set - up .",
    "it is worth noting that a similar effect can be pointed out only for candidates with high cross - section with ordinary matter , which implies low dm local density in order to fulfill the dama / libra dm annual modulation results .",
    "such dm candidates could get trapped in substantial quantities in the earth s core ; in this case they could annihilate and produce secondary particles ( e.g. neutrinos ) and/or they could carry thermal energy away from the core , giving potentiality to further investigate them .",
    "preliminary investigations on dm candidates inducing diurnal variation were performed in refs . @xcite and more recently in ref .",
    "during a sidereal day the earth shields a terrestrial detector with a varying thickness , and this induces a variation of the flux of the dm candidates impinging the detector , mainly because of the modification of their velocity distribution , @xmath4 .",
    "it is worth noting that this _ earth shadow effect _ is very small and could be detectable only in case of candidates with high cross - section with ordinary matter ( i.e. present in the galactic halo with small abundance ) .",
    "the detector ( and the hosting laboratory ) velocity in the galactic frame can be written as : @xmath5 where : ( i ) @xmath6 is the velocity of the local standard of rest ( lsr ) because of the rotation of the galaxy ; ( ii ) @xmath7 is the sun peculiar velocity with respect to lsr ; ( iii ) @xmath8 is the velocity of the orbital motion of the earth around the sun and ( iv ) @xmath9 is the velocity of the rotation of the earth around its axis . the two latter terms change as function of the sidereal time , @xmath10 . using the galactic coordinate frame ( that is @xmath11 axis towards the galactic center , @xmath12 axis following the rotation of the galaxy and the @xmath13 axis towards the galactic north pole ) , one gets : @xmath14 , where @xmath15 km / s ( uncertainty at 90% c.l . )",
    "@xcite is the local velocity , and @xmath16 km / s @xcite .",
    "the dm particles in the galactic halo have a velocity distribution @xmath17 , which depends on the considered galactic halo model .",
    "@xcite has shown many possible scenarios for the galactic halo ; in the following we consider the isothermal halo model just because of its simplicity : @xmath18 with @xmath19 normalization constant and @xmath20 escape velocity , assumed in the following equal to 650 km / s , as often considered in literature ; however , it is also affected by uncertainty .",

    "to study the experimental data in terms of possible _ earth shadow effect _ , a montecarlo code has been developed to simulate the propagation of the dm candidates elastically scattering off earth nuclei in their travel in the earth towards the underground experimental site .",
    "for such a purpose useful information has been gathered about the earth composition and density .",
    "the montecarlo code numerically estimates the velocity distribution  in the laboratory coordinate system  of the impinging dm particles after having crossed the earth ; such velocity distribution depends on the mass of the dm candidate , on its cross - section on nucleons , on the initial unperturbed velocity distribution , on the sidereal time , and on the latitude and longitude of the laboratory : @xmath68 .",
    "then , this velocity distribution has been used to evaluate  in an assumed framework  the expected counting rate as a function of the sidereal time in order to be compared with the experimental data .    in this section details",
    "are given about the assumptions adopted in the simulation , as in particular : the earth model , the _ mean free path _ and path reconstruction of such dm candidate , the adopted interaction model ( nuclear form factor , scaling law , etc . ) and the @xmath68 estimation .      an earth model has been assumed in order to estimate the signal variation due to the _ earth shadow effect _ ; in particular , the matter density and composition of the earth have to be considered .",
    "the simulation adopts a simplified earth model starting by the preliminary reference earth model ( prem ) @xcite .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : tab1 ]    in this simplified model the rare isotopes ( mass percentage lower than 0.1% ) have been neglected .",
    "we assume that the considered dm candidates loss their energy elastically scattering off nuclei with spin - independent coupling .",
    "the _ mean free path _ in the @xmath72-th earth s layer is : @xmath73 where : i ) @xmath74 is the number density of the @xmath70-th nuclei in the earth s layer composed by @xmath47 nuclear species ; ii ) @xmath75 is the cross - section on the @xmath70-th nucleus and @xmath76 is the mass of the @xmath70-th nucleus ; iii ) @xmath69 is the layer s density ; iv ) @xmath71 is the @xmath70-th nucleus mass percentage in the layer .",

    "nucleus(nucleon ) reduced mass .",
    "thus , assuming @xmath82 , one can write : @xmath83    for simplicity , the deflection of the dm particles crossing the earth is neglected ( i.e. a linear trajectory is considered ) ; in this assumption the earth thickness crossed by those dm candidates , @xmath25 , depends only on the impinging angle with respect to the detector , @xmath26 , according to the relation : @xmath84 with @xmath85 earth radius .",
    "this @xmath25 value is the sum of the distances passed through by the dm candidate in each layer : @xmath86 . defining the maximum radii of the earth layers @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 for inner core , external core and mantle respectively ( see table [ tab : tab1 ] ) ,",

    "another important effect is the _ channeling _ of low energy ions along axes and planes of the nai(tl ) dama crystals .",
    "this effect can lead to an important deviation , in addition to the other uncertainties discussed above .",
    "in fact , the _ channeling _ effect in crystals implies that a fraction of nuclear recoils are channeled and experience much larger quenching factors than those derived from neutron calibration ( see @xcite for a discussion of these aspects ) .",
    "since the _ channeling _ effect can not be generally pointed out with neutron measurements as already discussed in details in ref .",
    "@xcite , only modeling has been produced up to now .",

    "@xcite is able to reproduce the recoil spectrum measured at neutron beam by some other groups ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) . for completeness",
    ", we mention an alternative _ channeling _ model , as that of ref .",
    "@xcite , where larger probabilities of the planar channeling are expected .",
    "moreover , we mention the analytic calculation claiming that the _ channeling _ effect holds for recoils coming from outside a crystal and not from recoils produced inside it , due to the blocking effect @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , although some amount of blocking effect could be present , the precise description of the crystal lattice with dopant and trace contaminants is quite difficult and analytical calculations require some simplifications which can affect the result . because of the difficulties of experimental measurements and of theoretical estimate of this _ channeling _ effect , in the following it will be either included or not in order to give idea on the related uncertainty .",
    "thus , the data analysis has been repeated in some discrete cases which allow us to account for the uncertainties on the quenching factors and on the parameters used in the nuclear form factors . the first case ( set a )",
    "is obtained considering the mean values of the parameters of the used nuclear form factors ( see above and ref .",
