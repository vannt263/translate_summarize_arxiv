    "in the nuclear deep inelastic scattering on nuclei our time - distance resolution is given by variable z@xcite : @xmath3 which measures the propagation time of the hit quark caring the @xmath4 fraction of the longitudinal momentum of the nucleon of mass @xmath5 .",
    "start with the scenario where the partonic mean free paths @xmath6 are much shorter then the average distances between nucleons .",
    "this means that partons ( inside mesons ) remain inside the `` volume '' of a given nucleon and therefore we can treat nucleons as noninteracting objects remaining on the energy shell not affected by neighboring nucleons .    in the light cone formulation@xcite",
    ", @xmath7 corresponds to the nuclear fraction of quark longitudinal momentum @xmath8 and is equal ( in the nuclear rest frame ) to the ratio @xmath9 .",
    "but the composite nucleus is made of hadrons which are distributed with longitudinal momenta @xmath10 , where @xmath11 stands for nucleons , virtual pions , ... . in the convolution",
    "model@xcite a fraction of parton longitudinal momenta @xmath7 in the nucleus is given as the product @xmath12 of fractions : parton momenta in hadrons @xmath13 and longitudinal momenta of hadrons in the nucleus @xmath14 .",
    "the nuclear dynamics of given hadrons in the nucleus is described by the distribution function @xmath15 and sf @xmath16 describes its parton structure . in the convolution model restricted to nucleons and pions ( lightest virtual mesons ) the nuclear sf @xmath17 is described by the formula : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the parton distributions in the virtual pion and in the bound nucleon .",
    "the nucleon distribution @xmath21 in the basic convolution formula can be simplified in the rmf to the form@xcite : @xmath22 , \\label{rmf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the nucleon spectral function was taken in the impulse approximation : @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 is the nucleon fermi energy and @xmath26 takes the values given by the inequality @xmath27 .",
    "the msr for the nucleonic part is sensitive to the fermi energy as can be seen from the integral : @xmath28 thus the nucleonic part of msr gives a factor @xmath29 which is equal to @xmath30 at the saturation point .",
    "if the nucleon sf is not changed in the medium ( no emc effect except fermi motion ) the total ( [ sr ] ) msr is satisfied without nuclear pions : @xmath31    summarizing , good description @xcite of these deeply inelastic processes without gluon degrees of freedom allows us to assume that fraction of momentum carried by quarks does not change from nucleon to nucleus ( @xmath32 one half , the rest is carried by gluons ) .",
    "we will assume that balance also above the saturation point of nm .",
    "now for the non zero pressure the fermi energy in nm is no longer equal to the average binding energy , and corrections to msr ( [ rmf2 ] ) proportional to the pressure which will now be investigated .",
    "for finite pressure very important is well known hugenholtz van hove relation between @xmath25 , @xmath33 and pressure @xmath34 ( see for example ) @xcite .",
    "the fermi energy is defined as density derivative of the total nuclear energy @xmath35 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 gives the volume . at the saturation point @xmath38 .",
    "but for negative pressure @xmath34 @xmath39 and we have room for additional pion inside nm ( even with unmodified nucleons ) in the bjrken limit ( parton picture ) .",
    "consider the additional pion contributions .",
    "the amount of @xmath40 of the total nuclear momentum@xcite was estimated from ( [ sum ] ) for @xmath41 due to the smaller , @xmath4 dependent nucleon mass @xmath42 . for higher density ,",
    "the average distances between nucleons are smaller , therefore parameter @xmath43 ( [ eq : mamam2 ] ) will increase with density .",
    "it means that the room for nuclear pions given by ( [ sum ] ) from @xmath4 dependent nucleon mass @xmath44 will be reduced for higher densities and a dependence of @xmath5 from bjrken @xmath4 will vanish gradually .",
    "also the pion effective cross section is strongly reduced at high nuclear densities above the threshold in @xmath45 reaction calculated in dirac - brueckner approach @xcite ( also with rpa insertions to self energy of @xmath46 and @xmath47 @xcite included ) . therefore for positive pressure",
    "the nuclear pions carry much less then @xmath40 of the nuclear longitudinal momentum and dealing with a non - equilibrium correction to the nuclear distribution ( [ structure ] ) we will restrict considerations to the nucleon part without additional virtual pions between them @xmath48 the equation of state ( eos ) for nm has to match the saturation point with compressibility @xmath49 but then the behavior for higher densities is different for different rmf models .",
    "we compare here two extreme examples : stiff model of walecka @xcite and nonrelativistic expansion in powers of fermi momentum @xcite . for linear coupling in the standard walecka model at saturation density of nm compressibility",
    "is too large ( @xmath50 mev ) .",
    "the energy @xmath51 shown in fig.[meson ] influences the nuclear eos . in both models ,",
    "two coupling constants of the theory are fixed by the empirical saturation density .",
    "our approach is different . in this work",
    "we consider the change of the nucleon mass with the change of the parton distribution ( nucleon sf ) above the saturation point .",
    "the increasing pressure between nucleons starts to increase the @xmath25 ( [ rmf2 ] ) and consequently the sum rule ( [ msr ] ) is broken by the factor @xmath52 . to compensate this factor which increases the longitudinal momentum ( [ msr ] ) of nuclear partons , the nucleon sf in the nuclear medium has to be changed . for good estimate , in order to proceed without new parameters , assume ( similarly to ( [ scale ] ) ) that the changes of sf will be included through the changes of bjrken @xmath4 in the medium . multiplying the argument of the sf by a factor @xmath29 the sf",
    "will be squeezed towards smaller @xmath4 and the total fraction of longitudinal momentum will be smaller by a factor @xmath53 : @xmath54 here in the integral we neglect the small contributions from @xmath55 region originated from nn correlations .",
    "( walecka ) and density dependent mass @xmath56 from our `` mass mod . ''",
    "also effective mass @xmath57 in these approaches .",
    "both models are calculated for @xmath58 and @xmath59 parametrization.,width=321,height=302 ]    now , with the help of eq.([rmf2 ] ) and eq.([msr1 ] ) , the nuclear msr is satisfied : @xmath60    this means that quarks in the nucleus carry the same fraction of longitudinal momentum as in bare nucleons .",
    "on the other hand the integral ( [ msr1 ] ) corresponds ( [ eq ] ) to the total sum of the quark longitudinal momenta @xmath61 inside a nucleon , which is proportional to a total nucleon rest energy or the nucleon mass .",
    "consequently , the nucleon mass @xmath62 will be changed for @xmath63 to the mass @xmath56 by the gradually decreasing factor @xmath53 :    @xmath64    which decreases as the pressure increases . this explicit mass dependence from energy @xmath33 and energy derivative ( [ masseff ] )",
    "is plugged into the following standard walecka rmf equations@xcite for energy per nucleon @xmath33 and effective mass @xmath57 :     as a function of nm density for two rmf models ; scalar - vector walecka ( dot lines ) and our modified mass approach ( solid ) .",
    "both rmf models are calculated for two parameterizations : @xmath58 version@xcite @xmath65 and version@xcite @xmath59 @xmath66 ) .",
    "results for full dbhf@xcite ( dotted marked line ) calculation using bonn a nn interaction are displayed for comparison , also nucleon energy in zm model@xcite is in the plot ( dotted marked line).,height=321 ]",
    "here , our model applied to the linear walecka model for nuclear and neutron matter make the eos softer , close to semi - empirical analysis@xcite and close to dbhf calculation with a realistic bonn a potential@xcite .",
    "other features of the walecka model , including a good value of the spin - orbit force remain in our model unchanged .",
    "our results suggest corrections above the saturation density to any rmf model , with constant nucleon mass and unmodified parton sf .",
    "the stiffness of eos recently discussed@xcite in application to compact and neutron stars is important when studying star properties ( mass - radius constraint ) .",
