    "the relationship between the mass and x - ray temperature of galaxy clusters is a necessary bridge between theoretical press - schechter models , which give the mass function ( mf ) of clusters , and the observed x - ray temperature function ( tf ) ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "theoretical arguments suggest that the virial mass of a galaxy cluster is simply related to its x - ray temperature as @xmath0 .",
    "these arguments are supported by simulations which show a tight correlation between mass and temperature ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "the oldest method of measuring cluster mass is the virial mass estimate based on dynamical analysis of the observed velocity dispersion of the cluster galaxies .",
    "the existence of the x - ray emitting icm of galaxy clusters allows an independent mass estimate but requires knowledge or assumptions about both the x - ray temperature and surface brightness profiles .",
    "more recently , strong and weak gravitational lensing by clusters has provided a third independent mass estimate .",

    "we then compare this relation with those using masses based on galaxy velocity dispersions ( section  [ sec : dispersion ] ) , x - ray mass estimates of clusters with spatially resolved x - ray temperature profiles ( section  [ sec : noniso ] ) , and isothermal x - ray mass estimates ( @xmath2-model estimates in section  [ sec : beta ] and surface brightness deprojection in section  [ sec : deproj ] ) . in section  [ sec : conclusions ] , we discuss the results and present conclusions .",

    "assuming the dark matter density @xmath5 in the outer parts of the clusters , which both the emn simulations and girardi data ( at least the galaxy distribution ) seem to follow , we have rescaled their masses to @xmath47 .",
    "effectively this is just a change of normalization such that the rescaled masses are smaller than @xmath48 by about 15% ( with a standard deviation of about 5% ) .",
    "figure  [ f1.eps ] shows the distribution of rescaled virial masses versus temperature for this subsample .",
    "a power law fit using the bces bisector method of @xcite , which takes into account the errors in both variables and the possibility of intrinsic scatter , gives @xmath49 ( all quoted errors are 1@xmath50 unless otherwise stated ) , marginally inconsistent with the emn relation .",

    "our results are marginally steeper than this and consistent with many previous estimates ( e.g. , 0.61 @xmath35 0.13 from bird et  al .",
    "however , our fit is shallower than the fit g98 give in their paper ( 0.62 @xmath35 0.04 ) possibly due to improved x - ray temperatures since they use einstein and ginga temperatures from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , our fit is definitely shallower than the 0.67 @xmath35 0.09 found by wu et  al .",
    "while they draw a much larger sample ( 94 clusters ) from the literature , their sample is heterogeneous and the quality of their data is unclear .",
    "in contrast , we are using only g98 derived velocity dispersion with greater than 30 member redshifts and precise asca temperatures .",
    "the scatter in the virial mass estimator is expected to be quite large because of shot noise due to the finite number of galaxies in a cluster and projection effects due to contamination by background and foreground galaxies .",
    "the scatter in the observed virial mass  temperature relation is then a combination of the dispersion in the virial mass estimator ( with respect to the true cluster mass ) and any intrinsic dispersion in the m ",

    "figure  [ f3.eps ] excludes the six outliers that were not fitted , including these clusters increases the standard deviation to 0.59 .",
    "the expected scatter in the virial mass estimator has not been widely reported in the literature , but @xcite find that in their simulations of galaxy clusters the ratio of the virial mass to true mass is @xmath62 ( 1@xmath50 standard deviation ) after removing contaminating background and foreground galaxies .",
    "this predicted scatter is close to the observed scatter around the fit and suggests the dispersion in the virial mass  temperature relationship is primarily due to the scatter in the virial mass estimator .",
    "this is further supported by the distribution of @xmath63 as a function of the number of redshifts ( @xmath64 ) used to calculate the virial mass ( see figure  [ f4.eps ] which also includes clusters with less than 30 redshifts ) .",
    "the scatter is about a factor of 2 lower for clusters with @xmath65 .",
    "this is not surprising as a larger number of redshifts increases the accuracy of the virial mass estimator by decreasing the shot noise .",
    "together with the results in figure 3 , this further indicates that the m - t relation must have very small intrinsic scatter .",
    "x - ray mass estimates are based on the assumptions that the icm is in hydrostatic equilibrium and supported solely by thermal pressure . with the further assumption of spherical symmetry , the gas density , temperature , and pressure are related to the mass by : @xmath66 @xmath67 where k is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath68 is the mean molecular weight of the gas . the enclosed mass at a radius , r is then : @xmath69,\\ ] ] which depends on both the gas density and temperature profiles .",

    "measuring the actual temperature profiles of clusters has really only become practical with the advent of asca and its ability to obtain spatially resolved spectra .",
    "the combination of using rosat to obtain @xmath71 and asca to obtain @xmath72 can yield cluster masses with unprecedented accuracy .",
    "however , estimating the temperature profile is complicated by the spatial and energy of the asca psf , and mass estimates have only been reported for a few of the best observed clusters .",
    "the difficulty of measuring the temperature profiles means that there are far larger samples of clusters for which only the average x - ray temperature and isothermal mass estimates are available .",
    "no large catalog of clusters with masses measured using spatially resolved temperature profiles has been published .",
    "therefore , we have searched the literature ( including conference proceedings ) to obtain a sample of 12 clusters with masses measured using known temperature profiles .",
    "these clusters are presented in table  [ tab : clusters ] with the adopted average x - ray temperature and 90% confidence limits ( column 2 or table notes ) , largest radius in which the mass was given ( column 5 ) , the mass within that radius ( column 6 ) , and the reference from which the data was taken ( column 10 ) .",
    "if given , we have used global temperature values given by the respective authors .",
    "otherwise , we have taken them from catalogs of asca temperatures as in section  [ sec : dispersion ] .",
    "the formal errors on these mass estimates are small as they are well constrained by the density and temperature profiles .",
    "however , the systematic uncertainties ( i.e.   uncertainties in the asca psf and effective area ) are much more difficult to quantify . for fitting purposes ,",
    "we have chosen not to weight the fit with any mass errors , only with the errors in temperature .",
    "several of the clusters used warrant some comments .",
    "the masses for a496 and a2199 from @xcite were derived without asca psf corrections .",
    "however , the corrections are not large for these clusters as they are relatively cool and only the central field - of - view of the telescope was used .",
    "a2256 is known merger , but @xcite argue that the subcluster is physically well separated along the line of sight and has not disturbed the bulk of the primary cluster s gas . although this cluster was considered an outlier in the virial mass fit , this can be attributed due to contamination of the optical velocity dispersion measurement .    as with the virial masses",
    ", we have rescaled the masses to a density contrast of 200 assuming the dark matter density profile @xmath73 . on average ,",
    "the effect of rescaling is to increase the masses by an average of 20% with a standard deviation of @xmath7425% .",
    "there is some support for using this profile .",
    "@xcite and @xcite report similar profiles for a2163 and a2256 .",
    "while other authors in table  [ tab : clusters ] do not give density profiles , some ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) contain plots of the mass as a function of radius which are consistent with the @xmath5 profile .",
    "lastly , the clusters themselves seem to obey this profile .",
    "figure  [ f6.eps ] show the density contrast ( effectively the average density ) as a function of radius .",
    "we normalize the radius to emn s @xmath75 , the radius at which the density contrast is 200 , so that we are comparing similar scales in different clusters but this makes little difference . an unweighted fit indicates that @xmath76 .    in figure  [ f5.eps ]",

    "has the tendency to increase the dispersion in this fit ( i.e.  about 25% for @xmath4 ) but does not have much effect on the power law index or normalization of the fit .",
    "the lower normalization than that found using the emn relation or virial masses may reflect systematics in the masses derived using the temperature profiles , or it could be a problem with the simulations and systematics in the virial mass determinations .",
    "@xcite have found that the virial mass estimate can either overestimate or underestimate the mass depending on the aperture of the region sampled .",
    "however , a direct comparison of the virial mass and x - ray masses for the 9 clusters with temperature profiles masses ( @xmath78 ) and g98 virial masses ( @xmath60 ) ( figure  [ f8.eps ] ) shows no clear trend .",
    "further simulations and future observations of clusters with temperature profiles and virial masses will be need to explore this issue further .",
    "the most often used x - ray mass estimator has been the isothermal @xmath2-model which assumes that the gas is isothermal and that the gas density follows equation  [ eq : bmodel ] .",
    "equation  [ eq : hydro ] then becomes : @xmath79 assuming @xmath80 .",
    "the @xmath2-model mass can be written in terms of density contrast ( equation  [ eq : over ] ) as : @xmath81    we derive @xmath2-model masses using the data of @xcite ( hereafter f97 ) . in his study of the metal abundances and enrichment in the icm , f97 presents a catalog of 38 clusters with temperatures , core radii , and @xmath2 parameters derived from asca data ( see table  [ tab : clusters ] columns 2 , 7 , and 8) .",
    "f97 estimated the @xmath2 parameter from the asca gis data using a monte - carlo method to take into account the spatial and energy dependence of the gis psf and estimated temperatures by excluding the central region of the x - ray emission to minimize cooling flow biases .",
    "the f97 data has the advantage of being a homogeneous sample , although asca is not the best instrument for surface brightness fitting due to its complicated psf .",
    "however , the asca gis @xmath2-model fits are rather insensitive to the presence of cooling flows due to the high bandpass of the gis .",
    "the clusters are also at low redshifts and so subtend a large area of the detector minimizing the effect of the poor resolution of the gis .",
    "we compared the f97 @xmath2 values with those of derived from rosat studies ( primarily using the pspc ) of @xcite , @xcite , and various others taken from the literature via the compilation of @xcite ( see figure  [ f7.eps ] and table  [ tab : clusters ] column 9 ) . in general , they agree fairly well although rosat @xmath2 values are higher by an average of about 5% .    in figure  [ f5.eps ] , we plot the estimated @xmath2-model mass at @xmath47 ( using equation  [ eq : beta2 ] ) versus x - ray temperature .",
    "the relationship ( @xmath82 ) is steeper than that seen using the emn simulations , virial masses , or temperature profile masses .",
    "in addition , the relative normalization with respect to the other mass estimators is a function of density contrast . increasing the density contrast shifts the @xmath2-model masses",
    "lower with respect to the emn ( or virial mass ) relation and closer to the temperature profile masses while decreasing the density contrast has the opposite effect .",
    "the isothermal @xmath2-model implicitly assumes a dark matter density profile of @xmath4 in the outer parts of clusters .",
    "the density profiles of clusters in the emn simulations and clusters with measured temperature profiles generally seem to follow a steeper profile @xmath5 ( see section  [ sec : noniso ] and figure  [ f6.eps ] ) .",
    "therefore , the dark matter density profile implied by the isothermal @xmath2 model is probably not an accurate representation of clusters , and , despite the agreement of the @xmath2-profile with the observed gas density distribution , the different dark matter density profiles means that agreement between the isothermal @xmath2 model estimate and other mass estimates will be a function of radius ( hence density contrast ) .",
    "the @xmath2-model masses underestimate the cluster mass at small radii and overestimate it at large radii .",
    "this has been pointed out previously by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the different density profiles explain the relative steepness of the @xmath83 relationship . for an individual cluster , @xmath84 . at",
    "any given density contrast , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , so the @xmath2 model mass within that overdensity would be @xmath87 similar to the fit given above .",
    "even if the underlying assumptions of the isothermal @xmath2-model are flawed , equation  [ eq : bmodel ] should still provide a good fit to the gas density distribution ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the emn relation is basically a @xmath2-model with @xmath88 for all clusters ( depending on density contrast ) regardless of x - ray temperature .",
    "however , the f97 data show a definite correlation of @xmath2 with @xmath56 ( see figure  [ f9.eps ] ) .",
    "this indicates that the gas profile becomes shallower at lower masses .",
    "the relationship closely resembles that of the @xcite models with galactic winds , although with a normalization 20% lower .",
    "the variation of @xmath2 with @xmath56 is unlikely to be an artifact of the f97 fitting procedure . as we noted in the previous section the f97 @xmath2 values generally agree with rosat values .",
    "the correlation of @xmath2 and @xmath56 has also been noted previously in einstein data @xcite , and , more recently , @xcite have found a similar trend for @xmath2 defined in a non - parametric and non - azimuthally averaged fashion using pspc data .",
    "@xcite also note the behavior of @xmath2 with @xmath56 and the discrepancy between the @xmath2-model and the expected emn masses in their sample of clusters compiled from the literature .",
    "in fact , redoing the proceeding analysis with their sample gives virtually identical results .",
    "another method for determining the mass of a cluster is x - ray image deprojection .",
    "the constraint of the observed surface brightness profile means that the profiles for the variables in equation  [ eq : deproj1 ]  &  [ eq : deproj2 ] can be determined by specifying one of them .",
    "the usual procedure is to divide the surface brightness emission into annuli .",
    "the outer pressure must be set in the outermost annuli ( assumed to be due to gas not detected because its surface brightness is too low ) .",
    "the observed emissivity in the outer shell determines the temperature and hence the density .",
    "this procedure is then stepped inward and repeated . for more detailed discussion",
    "see @xcite , white et  al .",
    "( hereafter wjf ) and references therein .",
    "wjf present an analysis of 207 clusters using an x - ray image deprojection analysis of einstein ipc and hri data to estimate the masses of clusters .",
    "wjf choose the functional form of the gravitational potential as two isothermal spheres , representing the central galaxy and general cluster potentials .",
    "these are parameterized by a velocity dispersion and core radius . for the central galaxy ,",
    "these are fixed at 350 km s@xmath25 and 1 h@xmath25 kpc .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the cluster potential is taken from the literature or interpolated from the x - ray temperature or luminosity using an empirical relation .",
    "the core radius is a free parameter in the analysis which , with the outer pressure , is constrained to produce a flat temperature profile .",
    "therefore , the derived gravitational mass depends on the velocity dispersion , x - ray surface brightness distribution , and temperature .",
    "wjf determine the mass within the radius that they have x - ray data , which may be fairly small , while the emn relation is only valid in the outer parts of the cluster ( i.e.  low values of density contrast ) . as with the g98 clusters , we can rescale the mass to a @xmath47 , at least for the wjf clusters which have data in the outer parts of the cluster .",
    "we have rescaled the clusters with data at density contrasts ( @xmath89 ) less than 2000 to @xmath90 assuming @xmath4 as is the case for an isothermal sphere .    in figure  [ f10.eps ] , we show the resulting @xmath91 versus @xmath56 relation . although the lower @xmath56 error bars are quite large , allowing the the points to be statistically consistent with the emn relation , the relation is obviously steeper . fitting this relation using the bces method",
    "gives a @xmath92 somewhat steeper than than found from the f97 data .",
    "the scatter in mass around this relation is also larger , about 50% .    although wjf interpolated @xmath50 or @xmath56 for many clusters , using only the 45 clusters with data at @xmath93 which did not have interpolated data does not alter our results . also , the results reported using a subsample of 19 clusters with better determined parameters by @xcite are consistent with the wjf results .",
    "furthermore , a recent deprojection analysis by @xcite of 45 clusters with rosat pspc or hri data gives a similar relationship as the wjf data , although the peres et  al .",
    "data are generally at higher density contrasts ( @xmath94 ) making the extrapolation to @xmath90 even more uncertain .",
    "interpretation of the deprojection results is difficult as the derived gravitational masses are a combination of optical ( the velocity dispersion ) and x - ray data ( the core radius and temperature ) .",
    "however , like the @xmath2-model masses the wjf masses follow a steeper relation due to the assumption of a potential which has a density profile which behaves as @xmath4 .",
    "the large scatter is probably due to the use of the velocity dispersion to set the depth of the potential well .",
    "we have examined the relationship between various galaxy cluster mass estimators and x - ray gas temperature .",
    "the resulting relationships generally agree to within @xmath95% in mass but with systematic offsets between different types of mass estimators . using g98 virial masses and asca temperatures , we find good agreement with the emn m ",
    "t relation after removing a few outliers .",
    "x - ray mass estimates using spatially resolved temperature profiles scale similarly but with a normalization about 40% lower .",
    "we note that the @xcite lensing estimate mentioned at the end of section  [ sec : mxtx ] lies between these two estimates .",
    "mass estimates based on the assumption of isothermality like the @xmath2-model follow a steeper scaling relation due to the implicit assumption that the dark matter density scales @xmath96 at large radii while observational and numerical evidence suggests that clusters follow steeper profiles ( i.e.  @xmath26 ) .",
    "as a consequence , the @xmath2 model underestimates the mass at low radii and overestimates it at large radii .    the intrinsic dispersion in the true m ",
    "t relationship is probably quite small .",
    "the scatter in the virial mass  temperature relation is consistent with most of the scatter being due to the dispersion in the virial mass estimator .",
    "the small scatter of the masses of clusters with spatially resolved temperature profiles also indicates that the dispersion in the m ",
    "t relation is probably @xmath43 10% .",
    "more insight may be gained through simulations of projection effects on various mass estimators , but the most comprehensive study of these effects @xcite is limited to fairly low masses clusters ( @xmath97 corresponding to @xmath98 kev )",
    ". simulations covering a larger mass range are necessary to better constrain the scatter in the m  t relation .",
    "our results also show that galaxy clusters seem to be affected by nongravitational processes such as energy injection by galactic winds .",
    "we find that @xmath2 , the asymptotic slope of the gas density profile , is a function of temperature .",

    "the good agreement between the virial and temperature resolved mass estimates and a @xmath99 scaling law indicates that any temperature changes ( @xmath100 ) due to energy injection must be small . however , meaningful constraints on @xmath100 are difficult given the relatively few clusters in this regime .    in the future ,",
