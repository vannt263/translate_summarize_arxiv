    "in this article , we study the evoluation of magneto - transport properties upon efe doping of undoped and la - doped sio thin films ( 5% la - la@xmath12sr@xmath13iro@xmath1 and 10% la - la@xmath14sr@xmath15iro@xmath1 ) at low temperatures .",
    "efe doping was achieved using ionic liquid gating .",
    "we measured magnetotransport under ionic liquid gating for the chemically undoped samples , where an ambipolar transport characteristics is observed .",
    "we found that the low temperature transport is always dominated by vrh mechanism , accompanied by a mr crossover at @xmath280 - 90  k. both these observations were unaffected by the changes in band filling .",
    "we measured the resistance @xmath16 of the samples as a function of the temperature @xmath17 in the range between 1.5 - 200  k. we applied gate voltage ( @xmath18 ) to the side gate in contact with ionic liquid at 260  k and subsequently the sample was cooled at a fixed @xmath18 .",
    "below 220  k , the ionic liquid freezes out completely and stable electrical measurements become possible .",
    "the gate modulation in the range of -2  v to 3  v was achieved without significant degradation of samples .",
    "@xmath18 applied outside of this regime caused electrochemical reactions , resulting in irreproducible @xmath19 .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ( a ) shows @xmath19 for sio films doped chemically with la ( filled symbols ) and undoped samples using an ionic liquid gate ( open symbols ) .",
    "all samples exhibit @xmath20 , i.e. , an insulating behavior , regardless of chemical doping ( up to 10% la doping ) .    the resistance of ionic liquid gated sample changes rapidly with decreasing @xmath17",
    ", whose behavior can be modulated by @xmath18 . to quantify this gate dependence ,",
    "we replot @xmath19 in an arrhenius form for a fixed @xmath18 ( inset of [ fig : fig1 ]  ( b ) ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of these samples can be divided broadly into two regimes : ( i ) high temperature activated regime ( @xmath21  k ) , where @xmath19 follows an activated ( arrhenius ) behavior ; and ( ii ) low temperature vrh regime ( @xmath22  k ) , where @xmath19 deviates from the arrhenius behavior and exhibits hopping conduction .",
    "the activation energy , @xmath23 , can be obtained from the slope of the linear fit in the high temperature regime of the arrhenius plot .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ]  ( b ) shows the plot of @xmath23 versus @xmath18 .",
    "interestingly , @xmath23 drops as @xmath24 increases with a peak value of @xmath25  mev at @xmath26  v. this ambipolar behavior suggests that the fermi level @xmath27 of the undoped ( @xmath26  v ) sample is close to the middle of the gap . hall measurement ( data not shown ) also indicates that @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) corresponds to n - type ( p - type ) carriers and the undoped samples ( @xmath26 ) are weakly p - type .",
    "the weak p - type nature of the undoped sample also results in the asymmetry of the activation energy as a function of @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the bell - shaped plot @xmath30 establishes ambipolar transport behavior in the mott insulating sio .",
    "previously , demonstration of ambipolar doping in a mott insulator was realized only by chemical doping across many samples@xcite . in our experiment , similar ambipolar doping of a mott insulator ( sio )",
    "is demonstrated in a single sample _ via _ electrochemical modulation .      in order to understand the nature of the gated surface layer",
    ", we used a simple two layer model as depicted in the lower inset of [ fig : fig2 ] ( a ) .",
    "hall measurements show that the undoped bulk sample has a weak p - type doping ( [ fig : fig2 ] ( b ) ) , with a carrier density @xmath31  @xmath32 . upon electrolyte gating , efe induced charges accumulate on the surface layer , which has a different conductivity as compared to the bulk of the film . for the hole accumulation side ( @xmath33 ) , the conductance of the surface layer , @xmath34 , can be estimated from the difference of the conductance with reference to @xmath35 : @xmath36 .    in the case of electron doping ( @xmath37 )",
    ", a depletion layer is formed first on the surface and then gradually becomes electron doped ( n - type ) for higher @xmath18 .",
    "therefore @xmath38 increases initially when @xmath18 increases as shown in [ fig : fig1](a ) and then starts decreasing for higher @xmath18 . for undoped samples ,",
    "@xmath38 is the largest for @xmath39  v. the thickness of depletion layer , @xmath40 , thus can be estimated from @xmath41  nm , where @xmath42  nm is the thickness of the sample . using @xmath43",
    ", we can estimate @xmath34 for this inversion regime by subtracting the sheet conductance of the depleted layer using  : @xmath44 .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ]  ( a ) shows @xmath34 ( @xmath17 ) for fixed @xmath18 .",
    "the conductance steeply drops as @xmath17 decreases , which is expected from the transport through localized states .",
    "we employ a simple activation model to mobility edge to describe the temperature dependent transport through the surface conduction layer : @xmath45 $ ] , where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are the mobility edge , fermi energy , and mott minimum conductance , respectively .",
    "typically such an analysis is performed on semiconductors which exhibit disorder induced mobility edge  @xcite , where characteristic carrier density and temperature dependence of the mobility is observed . using this simple activation formula , we fit the experimental data of temperature dependent @xmath34 for fixed @xmath18 ( solid lines in [ fig : fig2 ]  ( a ) ) and obtain @xmath46 - @xmath47 and @xmath48 for different gate voltages , which are shown in the upper inset of [ fig : fig2 ]  ( a ) .",
    "the activation fits are reasonable for most of gate voltages at higher temperature ranges ( @xmath49  150  k ) , but starts deviating at lower temperatures , likely indicating the limitations of such a model at low temperatures .",
    "the obtained values of @xmath50 - @xmath47 are similar to the activation energy , @xmath23 , and the @xmath48 is @xmath2 few @xmath51 , as it is expected for 2d localization  @xcite .",
    "while the disorder driven localization seemingly explains the observed behavior of @xmath34 , there are a few factors that are not captured by a simple localization theory .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ]  ( b ) shows that the measured hall mobility remains roughly constant ( @xmath20.08  @xmath52/vsec ) , despite that @xmath34 and @xmath53 decrease almost an order of magnitude for a wide range of carrier density ( both electrons and holes ) .",
    "this filling independent mobility is not expected for disorder induced localization , where one expects a steep increase of mobility as @xmath27 is getting close to the mobility edge  @xcite .",
    "we also make a note on the strain effect on both the insulating state and the efe on the transport properties .",
    "although we have measured the transport properties of 25 nm thick sio films on various substrates such as sto , lsat , dso ( dysco@xmath54 ) , and gso ( gdsco@xmath54 ) , which exert different amount of strain on sio , the insulating nature of the material persists in all samples .",
    "despite the qualitative similarity , the films showed subtle changes in the resistivity .",
    "there are a few reports on the effect of strain on the optical and transport gap of sio in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the detailed study of strain effect , however , is beyond the scope of the current investigation .",
    "the low temperature hopping regime can be dominated by either defect mediated hopping , known as mott vrh  @xcite or by coulombic interactions , known as efros - shklovskii ( es ) vrh  @xcite .",
    "temperature dependent vrh resistivity can be described by @xmath55 = @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is a characteristic hopping energy scale and @xmath58 is the exponent , dependent on dimension and type of vrh  @xcite , where @xmath59 for mott vrh and @xmath60 for es vrh .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] shows the resistance of electron doped sio with 10% la ( red squares ) and hole doped sio with @xmath61 = -2 v ( green circles ) plotted against inverse square root of temperature .",
    "the data shows excellent agreement at low temperatures with @xmath57 as a fitting parameter .",
    "we obtain @xmath57 values of 860  k and 420  k for the electron and hole doped cases respectively . at higher temperature ,",
    "the es - vrh deviates from the measured data around @xmath2 80  k as marked by the vertical arrows in the graph .",
    "the @xmath57 values estimated above are comparable to the values reported elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "these values are also in agreement with the temperature criterion necessary to observe es - vrh presented in  @xcite , where we obtain @xmath62  @xmath2 20 - 50  k , within the es - vrh regime in our experiments .",
    "also , we note that the crossover temperature ( @xmath63@xmath2 80  k ) is much higher than typical @xmath63 in disordered semiconductors  @xcite , but similar mott - es vrh crossover and @xmath63 has been reported in indium oxide  @xcite and most recently , undoped sio  @xcite .",
    "as the temperature range used in the above temperature dependence analysis is rather limited ( at best an order of magnitude change in temperature ) , any conclusion of the nature of hopping conduction should be supported by a stronger evidence . hence , in order to clarify the nature of the hopping conduction in sio , we performed temperature dependent mr measurements .",
    "mr has been studied extensively in the hopping conduction regime for several semiconductors and alloys",
    "@xcite , where the temperature and field dependence of mr has been used to explain the low temperature transport mechanism .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] shows the transverse mr for ( a ) undoped , ( b ) ionic liquid gated hole doped , and ( c ) chemically electron doped samples , and ( d ) longitudinal mr for electron doped samples .",
    "both electron and hole doped samples demonstrate an abrupt mr sign change at @xmath64  k. the aforementioned mott - es crossover was also observed in a similar temperature range . at low temperatures ,",
    "the mr exhibits a positive , quadratic scaling with the magnetic field , but at high temperatures , the mr shows a negative , linear scaling with the magnetic field .",
    "an abrupt change in sign and field dependence of mr at such high temperatures is unusual , which deserves careful analysis . before we discuss the details of this crossover , we first focus on understand the limiting mr behavior .",
    "the high temperature linear negative mr in the vrh regime is often attributed to the quantum interference between the hops  @xcite , which was experimentally observed in disordered semiconductors and quasicrystalline alloys  @xcite .",
    "the low temperature positive mr can be attributed to several possibilities including ( i ) the shrinking of electronic impurity wave functions under a magnetic field  @xcite ; ( ii ) spin dependent mr ( kamimura effect )  @xcite or ( iii ) superconducting or magnetic fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "we eliminate the role of superconducting fluctuations ( i.e. , ( iii ) above ) as we are far from the metallic limit .",
    "we also exclude the possibility of a magnetic fluctuation based mechanism ( ( ii ) above ) , since a decreasing mr with temperature is expected as we approach the ordering temperature .",
    "moreover , we performed magnetization measurements on the undoped and 10% la doped samples , which exhibit a magnetic transition at temperatures of @xmath65  k and @xmath66  k respectively ( supporting information , figure s1 and section ii ) .",
    "this suggests that the magnetic transition temperature does not correlate with the observed mr sign @xmath63 .",
    "thus , we attribute the shrinking of the electronic impurity wave function as a probable cause for the observed positive mr at low temperatures and also provide supporting arguments , based on detailed mr measurements about the @xmath63 .    further supporting evidence of mott - es vrh crossover",
    "can be provided by detailed analysis of the crossover behavior of mr .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] clearly shows that the field and temperature dependent mr crossover is observed in 10% la doped samples over a narrow range of temperatures from 83 - 87 k.",
    "this behavior is strikingly similar to the mr crossover reported in the hopping regime of several disordered semiconductors and alloys  @xcite , although only qualitatively .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ]  ( a ) shows the variation of mr at an applied field of 10  t , highlighting the experimental observation that the sign change is qualitatively similar for a range and type of band filling ( both n - type and p - type ) .",
    "although the magnitudes of mr are quite different , interestingly , the mr sign change appears in all of our samples with nearly similar crossover temperature @xmath6780  k. similar temperature dependent mr behavior , which extended beyond the crossover region , was reported in highly compensated n - gaas  @xcite , further suggesting the qualitative similarities of mr crossover in these systems .",
    "the mr crossover behavior in disorder systems can often be associated with a coulomb gap opening  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ]  ( b ) shows the extracted minimum mr ( for a field of @xmath68  t ) , @xmath69_{min}$ ] , as a function of temperature . at high temperatures , the absolute value of @xmath70 increases as @xmath17 decreases , but then , for @xmath7180  k , @xmath70 drastically decreases with decreasing @xmath17 . considering both the interference of different tunneling paths with intermediate scattering centers and the deformation of the wave functions of the vrh sites",
    ", @xmath72 is a sensitive probe to the characteristic energy of the vrh ( w ) , coulomb gap energy ( @xmath73 ) and the potential depth of the ionized impurities ( @xmath74 )  @xcite . across the es - mott @xmath63 ,",
    "@xmath72 exhibits the power law dependence on temperature with different exponents .",
    "as it is indicated by a dotted line in [ fig : fig4 ]  ( b ) , for @xmath75 , @xmath70 follows closely @xmath76 scaling independent of band filling , corresponding to @xmath73 , @xmath74 @xmath77 w , suggesting a mott vrh dominated transport in this temperature range  @xcite . for @xmath78",
    ", @xmath70 decreases with decreasing t , signifying the suppression of negative mr , which is characteristic of the es - vrh regime ( supporting information , section i ) .",
    "thus , this mr crossover is attributed to the transition from mott vrh to es - vrh , due to the opening of coulomb gap .",
    "we note that the unusually fast suppression of the negative mr in the low temperature regime exhibits a power law decay much faster than the expected theoretical models  @xcite .",
    "such a discrepancy , however , if often observed in disordered semiconductors or alloys  @xcite . based on both phenomenological and numerical calculations presented in  @xcite , we rule out the possibility of the dominant role of spin scattering or spin - orbit coupled scattering in causing suppression of negative mr .",
    "theoretically , the formation of coulomb gap during es - vrh is the consequence of electron interaction and is also shown to be independent of the band filling  @xcite , in agreement with our experimental observations , explaining the universal crossover temperature across all doping in this system.detailed analysis of the @xmath70 crossover is given in the supplementary online information ( section i ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated that ionic liquid gating can be used to realize ambipolar transport in thin films of sio . despite the large carrier injection , the insulating state persists for both electron and hole doping attainable in our experiments .",
    "we observe a robust mr sign change , signifying a crossover from mott vrh to es - vrh .",

    "<S> the thin ( @xmath2  1 nm ) electric double layer formed at the interface of the channel and the ionic liquid allows us to accumulate or deplete such a large carrier density . </S>",
    "<S> this method has enabled experimental probing of a wide range of the electron density dependent phase diagrams  @xcite and phases inaccessible by chemical doping  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , efe doping with ionic liquids provides a good experimental platform to explore the electronic phase diagram of a variety of material systems without significant chemically induced disorder .    </S>",
    "<S> transition metal oxides ( tmos ) are excellent model systems for mott insulators , where localized @xmath5-orbitals cause strong electron correlation effects  @xcite . as we move down the periodic table , from 3-@xmath5 to 5-@xmath5 , tmos show weaker electron correlation but larger spin - orbit coupling , due to higher atomic numbers . among the 5-@xmath5 tmos , </S>",
    "<S> ruddlesden - popper series of iridates such as sr@xmath6ir@xmath7o@xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , specifically sr@xmath0iro@xmath10 ( sio ) , show an unusually robust insulating ground state , which persists despite chemical doping and applied pressure  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nature and origin of the insulating nature of sio remains controversial  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this compound also shows a weak ferromagnetic moment  @xcite , attributed to its canted antiferromagnetic ground state  @xcite . due to the interplay between electron correlation , spin - orbit coupling , magnetism and crystal field effects , </S>",
    "<S> understanding the nature of insulating state of sio remains complicated and yet interesting . </S>",
    "<S> existing transport studies report insulating and/or non - ohmic behavior in sio  @xcite and thus have provided little insight into the role of disorder and transport mechanisms of the insulating state . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , predictions of superconductivity in the electron doped sio and its similarities to la@xmath11cuo@xmath10  @xcite invites a thorough transport study to identify a route to achieve metallicity in mott insulating sio . </S>"
