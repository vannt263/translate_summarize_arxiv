    "in the `` ghost '' diffraction experiment of @xcite , photons correlated in a down conversion process are separated and then counted in coincidence after one photon passes through a slit mask .",
    "strange as it may seem , the slit diffraction pattern is observed on the detection screen of the other photon if one only counts those pairs for which the first photon is detected by a small - aperature fixed detector . for this epr @xcite type experiment ,",
    "the data was interpreted in @xcite in terms of entangled states .",
    "a second and similar experiment @xcite exhibited optical imaging via two photon coincidence counting .",
    "this experiment was likewise analyzed in terms of entangled states . in an earlier conference report @xcite",
    "we have shown with detailed numerical calculations that `` ghost '' diffraction patterns can be explained by trajectory correlations assuming an initial position and velocity relationship for the particles .    in the present work ,",
    "we give some detailed calculations of `` ghost '' diffraction patterns and examine trajectory details in comparison with those involved in deterministic explanations of ordinary diffraction .",
    "the trajectory calculations are carried out numerically using the trajectory - wave ordering interaction of @xcite .",
    "the latter is a set of second order differential equations for trajectories which invoke , via solution , the integral method of generating random variants .",
    "we begin with a brief description of this particle - wave interaction .",
    "the twoi studied earlier by the author , made use of a general line parameter @xcite .",
    "the following equations represent a version with time as the independent variable .",
    "@xmath0 in these equation the @xmath1 represent the particle coordinates , and @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath3 are components of a field ray - velocity and the function @xmath4 is a real positive function of field components with units of inverse time .",
    "the field affects the trajectories only through the @xmath3 and function @xmath4 .",
    "the twoi equations can be implemented with different choices for the @xmath3 and function @xmath4 , facilitating the study of different trajectory models .",
    "specific expressions for @xmath3 and @xmath4 used in the diffraction calculations here are discussed in the following section .",
    "modifications to impose metric constraints are discussed in @xcite .",
    "the above set of trajectory equations has in general two important properties .",
    "first , the @xmath5 approach the @xmath3 as a limit .",
    "second , in this limit @xmath6 , ( named the `` attractor limit '' in @xcite ) the large number distribution of the particles approaches the function @xmath4 provided the initial particle phase - space values are chosen uniformly randomly over a large but not unique volume . the attractor limit is approached closer and closer as time increases . for practical calculations",
    ", one must set some criteria for `` sufficiently close '' .",
    "these feature can be more easily seen with a simple one - dimensional case with @xmath7 .",
    "we directly integrate the following equation .",
    "@xmath8    this gives the following integral relations @xmath9 @xmath10 if we numerically solve ( [ t02 ] ) until the attractor limit @xmath11 is sufficiently satisfied , we obtain the following relation .",
    "@xmath12 repeating this process many times with ( @xmath13 ) chosen uniformly randomly over a sufficient volume of phase space , we generate a random variant specified by @xmath4 .",
    "the quantity @xmath14 is proportional to the number of particles that reach the attractor limit @xmath15 between @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "it is a technique that indirectly invokes the integral method @xcite to generate in the attractor limit a random variant specified by @xmath4 .",
    "it re - arranges an initial distribution to match @xmath4 .",
    "this interaction is viewed as one possible mechanism by which nature could bring about the observed relation between particle distributions and wave intensities .    to solve the trajectory equations we use both fourth and fifth order runge - kutta methods @xcite with adaptive step size techniques @xcite .",
    "these two methods are used as checks against each other .",
    "the adaptive step technique saves two to four orders of magnitude on net computation time .",
    "the system of second - order differential equations is reduced to a system of first - order differential equations following the method of butcher @xcite .",
    "numerical details and a test case are given in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "figure  [ f1 ] presents a histogram of particle positions in the attractor limit generated using ( [ t02 ] ) with @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 chosen uniformly randomly from the range @xmath21 .",
    "the `` sufficiently close '' to the attractor limit criteria used was @xmath22 .",
    "the solid line in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] gives the profile of @xmath4 scaled to match the particle histogram .",
    "this distribution can also be generated with a wide variety of choices of the initial phase space volume .",
    "use of random or a variety of amplitudes in @xmath4 ( instead of @xmath23 ) together with a sufficiently large initial phase - space volume will still generate the same shape .",
    "the noise in the distribution is due to initializing with a random number generator , the `` sufficiently close '' criteria and numerical approximations .",
    "the second property of the twoi equations is the alignment feature of the particle velocities with the wave ray velocity . from ( [ t01 ] )",
    "we can see that the rate that the attractor limit is approached depends on the initial velocity difference @xmath24 and upon @xmath4 . in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] we give some representative trajectories with particles initialized at @xmath25 beyond a slit of width @xmath26 .",
    "the particles are initialized in directions at @xmath27 intervals .",
    "one can see that the particles initially moving backwards can be turned around and approximately aligned up with the wave ray velocity in less than a wavelength .",
    "the twoi approach has some similiar features to , but some conceptional differences from , the deterministic approach initiated by madelung @xcite and de broglie @xcite and re - considered later by bohm @xcite and others @xcite for the schrodinger equation . in that work ,",
    "the particle velocity @xmath28 is identified with the wave ray velocity so that the particles follow the wave flow tangent lines .",
    "we will refer to this case ( @xmath29 ) as the attached case .",
    "this attached case is approached in the attractor limit for the twoi .",
    "critics of attached models quickly point out that the particle distribution must initially match the quadratic wave density , and that there is no mechanism to bring about the attached condition ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "if initial conditions are met , the continuity equation guarantees that the distributions will continue to match .",
    "however , if tangent lines are initiated with a density that does not match the quadratic wave density , they will continue to differ .",
    "interestingly , it was bohm @xcite who suggested using a force that depended on the difference ( @xmath30 ) to bring about the attached case as a limit .",
    "the twoi can bring about this case as a limit , as well as generate in the particle distribution the wave intensity pattern if the latter is represented by @xmath4 in the twoi equations .",
    "the twoi is a somewhat more general approach in that it does not depend upon a continuity equation , and @xmath4 can represent any field intensity . likewise , the @xmath31 can be chosen in different ways , e.g. , as a vector parallel to the poynting vector as in @xcite , or as in the interesting work of floyd @xcite .",
    "slit diffraction has been observed for many types of particles , including photons , neutrons and atoms . can slit diffraction",
    "be explained via calculating particle trajectories , one particle at a time ?",
    "one adamant view on this question is reflected in the well - known comment of richard feynman `` a phenomenon which is impossible , absolutely impossible , to explain in any classical way , and which has in it the heart of quantum mechanics '' @xcite . by treating the wave as a field and using the twoi ,",
    "the author has been able to obtain slit diffraction patterns , one particle at a time . here ,",
    "we present a single , a double and a triple slit diffraction pattern in figures  [ f3 ] ,  [ f4 ] , and  [ f5 ] respectively .",
    "these diffraction patterns are calculated using the following scalar wave equation @xmath32 and standard rayleigh - sommerfield diffraction @xcite with neumann boundary conditions together with the following equation for @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath33    for light diffraction , we use @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the speed of light . with ( [ t06 ] )",
    "we are taking @xmath31 proportional to the gradient of the phase of the complex field , as in the work of madelung @xcite and de broglie @xcite .",
    "the scalar field , together with its first and second partial derivatives needed in ( [ t01 ] ) , are calculated numerically for each point along each trajectory . because an adjustable step technique is used , the exact position where the trajectory crosses a screen is determined by using a fifth order lagrange interpolation polynomial @xcite .    in each figure",
    ", the wave is calculated assuming a point source @xmath36 in front of the slits and a detector screen at @xmath37 beyond the slits . for the single slit case shown in fig .",

    "the solid lines in these figures represents the wave intensity scaled to match the histograms . from these figures , it is clear that slit diffraction patterns can be reproduced via deterministic trajectory calculations using the twoi and treating the wave as a field .",
    "it is instructive to view some typical trajectories .",
    "figure  [ f6 ] shows some typical trajectories for a three slit case with slit width of @xmath39 and slit center to center separation of @xmath41 .",
    "these trajectories are near the attractor limit at the slits , so that the trajectories closely represent the wave flow tangent lines .",
    "notice that these trajectories are not straight lines and that the trajectories do not cross each other .",
    "these feature are characteristic of tangent line trajectories for waves involving the operator @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "two - photon correlations involving slit diffraction have been measured using photon pairs made in a parametric down conversion process @xcite .",

    "the `` unfolded '' sketch is illustrated in fig .",
    "these figures and notation follow fig .",
    "@xcite with some changes that feature the trajectory calculations here .",
    "the two polarization components are separated by a polarizing beam splitter into the `` signal '' beam and the `` idler '' beam as shown .",
    "the signal beam passes through a slit pattern onto a screen about a meter behind the slits .",
    "no slit pattern is placed in the idler beam .",
    "a small aperture detector @xmath43 is placed at a fixed position on the signal screen and a small aperture detector @xmath44 is used to scan the idler screen .",
    "coincident two - photon measurements are made for signal - idler photon pairs if a signal photon enters the fixed detector @xmath43 .",
    "after many pairs have been measured , the accumulated distribution on the idler screen clearly exhibits a slit diffraction pattern @xcite .",
    "this is remarkable because no slit mask exist in the idler beam .",
    "the author considers this to be one of the most intriguing experimental results of modern physics .",
    "it would appear that what happens to the signal photon is some how `` known '' by the idler photon .",
    "a two - photon entangled state explanation of the data distributions was given in @xcite .",
    "can this type of experiment be explained with a deterministic interactive particle - field model ? to investigate this problem , we consider a very simple model whose features are best illustrated by the unfolded version sketch in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] b. in this figure , as in @xcite , the distance @xmath45 is the distance from the slits back through the beam splitter @xmath46 to the crystal and then back along the idler path to the idler screen .",
    "the distance @xmath47 is the distance from the crystal to the beam splitter and on to the slits .",
    "@xmath48 is the distance from the slits to the fixed detector @xmath43 .",
    "we describe this system using our interacting particle - field model .",
    "o_-ray and _ e_-ray polarization components satisfy the wave equations @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and for both components we assume spherical wave solutions with sources centered at some point s in the crystal .",
    "the _ e_-ray is diffracted by the slits and the _ o_-ray continues to the idler screen .",
    "we likewise assume that together with the spherical wave , two particles are initialized at point s in the crystal with equal and opposite velocity vectors @xcite .",
    "e_-ray we calculate the diffracted wave as in the slit diffraction described above , but here the source point s is generally not on the optical axis .    to calculate the particle trajectories we use eqs .",
    "( [ t01 ] ) and ( [ t06 ] ) with @xmath34 , and @xmath51 or @xmath52 .",
    "our model crystal source is very thin in the @xmath53 direction and for each pair of particles , we choose the @xmath54 position of the source point s in the crystal uniformly randomly from a range of @xmath55 .",
    "the initial angular direction of the signal particle is likewise chosen uniformly randomly . however , the initial velocity direction of the idler particle is always fixed as the negative of the initial velocity direction of the signal particle ( as viewed in the unfolded picture of fig .",
    "this and the same initial position represent the initial trajectory coupling that gives rise to the `` ghost '' diffraction in this model .",
    "we first calculate the trajectory of the signal particle , and if it terminates in the aperture of detector @xmath43 , we calculate the trajectory of the idler particle and record where it hits the idler screen . with this coincidence restriction ,",
    "the accumulated histogram of idler particles on the idler screen is the `` ghost '' pattern in the language of @xcite .",
    "an initial report by the author on this type of two - photon `` ghost '' diffraction calculations for a single and double slit case appears in a recent conference proceedings @xcite .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] and fig .",
    "[ f9 ] the `` ghost '' diffraction patterns calculated with this simple model for cases of one and three slits respectively . for both cases we used @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 . for the single slit case , shown in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] we used a slit width of @xmath59 , a crystal half width of @xmath60 , and a @xmath61 aperture for the signal detector @xmath43 .",
    "for the three slit case shown in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] , we used a slit width of @xmath39 , a slit center - to - center separation of @xmath41 , a crystal half width of @xmath62 , and a @xmath26 aperture for the detector @xmath43 .",
    "it was necessary to calculate many signal trajectories because very few terminated on the narrow detector aperture of @xmath43 .",
    "the distinct recognizable diffraction patterns exhibited in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] and fig .",
    "[ f9 ] clearly indicate that two - photon `` ghost '' diffraction can be explained via deterministic trajectory calculations using the interacting particle - field model .",
    "this two - photon correlation phenomenon is a result of pattern selection via correlated trajectory selection .",
    "the trajectory correlations are entirely due to initial conditions . in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] and fig .",
    "[ f9 ] the solid line represents the diffraction pattern on the idler screen that results as if one had a point source at the signal detector on the signal screen .",
    "the common features of the solid line and the histogram are due to the common geometry in the almost fraunhofer limit . however , the patterns differ slightly from each other .",
    "this difference can be reasonably explained by the fact that the signal detector @xmath43 has a finite size .",
    "it is conceptually incorrect to think that the `` ghost '' diffraction is the result of a `` collapsed probability '' signal at @xmath43 propagating backwards to the idler screen .    in the conventional slit diffraction of fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , fig .",
    "[ f4 ] , and fig .",
    "[ f5 ] the wave used for each particle had a common point source . by sharp contrast , each particle in the `` ghost '' diffraction generally is influenced by a different wave since the source positions in the crystal have a wide range @xmath55 . a random selection of signal trajectories just beyond the slits",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ f10 ] for the three slit case .",
    "one can see that the trajectories cross each other and appear to have no definite pattern .",
    "in fact , if one accumulates a histogram on the signal screen , one finds a broad smear with no definite pattern .",
    "this is expected because each wave generally starts from a different source points in the crystal .",
    "however , it is in this very situation that we obtain the `` ghost '' diffraction pattern on the idler screen for that selection of signal trajectories that terminate in the fixed detector @xmath43 .",
    "this feature is consistent with the observations in @xcite , in which the `` ghost '' patterns were obtained using rather divergent beams . by shifting the position of the detector @xmath43",
    "we obtain a shifted `` ghost '' pattern on the idler screen .",
    "this corresponds to selecting an entirely different set of signal - idler trajectory pairs .",
    "the authors in @xcite mentions that this interesting feature was observed in the experiment .",
    "we have made `` ghost '' diffraction calculations using a trajectory model with two key features .",
    "the first feature is the use of the twoi equations to describe the trajectories . through the twoi ,",
    "the diffracted field influences the distribution of the trajectory particles , one trajectory at a time . as a physical model",
    "both particle and field must be taken together . here ,",
    "the twoi used to calculate the particle - field interaction is much closer to that of classical physics in which the particle is not `` attached '' to the field .",
    "this key freedom , not found in the `` attached '' models initiated by madlung @xcite and de broglie @xcite many years ago , facilitates the random variant generator inherent in the structure of the twoi to generate the wave intensity patterns in the ensemble distribution .",
    "the second key feature is the initial velocity correlation of the photons in the down conversion crystal , as well as the same initial position .",
    "as the calculations clearly demonstrate , this initial coupling together with the twoi is sufficient to give rise to the `` ghost '' diffraction patterns .",
    "this is a simple classical trajectory model of this photon - photon experiment .",
    "its success clearly lends support to a realistic and deterministic description of nature .",
