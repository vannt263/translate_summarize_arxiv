    "this is the first detailed spectroscopic study of oxygen - line blobs which includes the analyses of the escape velocity , the mass loading factor , and the presence of an agn , and is a significant step toward understanding the nature of oxygen - line blobs and the relationship between gas outflow and star formation quenching at high redshift .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "<S> we report our keck / mosfire and magellan / ldss3 spectroscopy for an blob , oiib  10 , that is a high-@xmath0 galaxy with spatially extended @xmath1 emission over 30 kpc recently identified by a subaru large - area narrowband survey . </S>",
    "<S> the systemic redshift of oiib  10 is @xmath2 securely determined with @xmath3 and h@xmath4 emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> we identify feii@xmath52587 and mgii@xmath62796,2804 absorption lines blueshifted from the systemic redshift by @xmath7 and @xmath8 km s@xmath9 , respectively , which indicate gas outflow from oiib  10 with the velocity of @xmath10 km s@xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this outflow velocity is comparable with the escape velocity , @xmath11 </S>",
    "<S> km s@xmath9 , estimated under the assumption of a singular isothermal halo potential profile . some fraction of the outflowing gas could escape from the halo of oiib  10 , suppressing oiib  10 s star - formation activity . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate a mass loading factor , @xmath12 , that is a ratio of mass outflow rate to star - formation rate , and obtain @xmath13 which is relatively high compared with low-@xmath0 starbursts including u / lirgs and agns . </S>",
    "<S> the major energy source of the outflow is unclear with the available data . </S>",
    "<S> although no signature of agn is found in the x - ray data , oiib  10 falls in the agn / star - forming composite region in the line diagnostic diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that the outflow is powered by star formation and a type-2 agn with narrow fwhm emission line widths of @xmath14 km s@xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first detailed spectroscopic study of oxygen - line blobs , which includes the analyses of the escape velocity , the mass loading factor , and the presence of an agn , and a significant step to understanding the nature of oxygen - line blobs and the relation with gas outflow and star - formation quenching at high redshift . </S>"
