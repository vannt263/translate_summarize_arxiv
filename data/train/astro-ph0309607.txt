    "the probability for a planetary signal varies with the projected orbital radius of the planet @xmath4 reaching a maximum near @xmath5 , with the _ einstein radius _ @xmath6 , the schwarzschild radius of the lens star @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 being source or lens distances .    by achieving a galactic length scale @xmath11 ^ 2 $ ] for m - dwarf lens stars ( @xmath12 ) ,",

    "this condition is met not only for observations of galactic bulge stars being lensed by stars in both the galactic disk or the bulge itself ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) , but also for observations of stars in other galaxies as m31 ( crotts 1992 ; jetzer 1994 ) lensed by stars in the same galaxy ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) .",
    "while the probability to detect a planetary deviation and its duration decreases with smaller mass ratios @xmath17 ( roughly as @xmath18 ) , the maximal deviation @xmath19 is only limited by the radius of the source star @xmath20 ( bennett & rhie 1996 ) . for @xmath21% on observing m31 stars , a minimal mass ratio of @xmath22 ^ 2",

    "due to its small angular size , the monitoring of m31 requires only a few fields and therefore only a fraction of telescope time during each night . a proposed network of at least four 2m - class telescopes distributed around the northern hemisphere ( dominik 2002 ) will provide a sampling interval of @xmath25h . _ on - line data reduction _ based on _ difference - imaging _ will allow an increased sampling through target - of - oppurtunity observations in the case of ongoing anomalies .",
    "since m31 observations comprise _ unresolved star fields _ , only events with _ high peak magnification _ @xmath26 on _ bright sources _ are detectable , ruling out catching signatures of earth - mass planets .",
    "the smaller fraction of useful events is partly compensated by the _ large number of source stars _ and an _ increased planet detection efficiency _ for larger peak magnifications ( griest & safizadeh 1998 ) .",
