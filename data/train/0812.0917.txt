    "1996 ) it has been suggested that the emission occurs in a number of distinct astronomical objects , such as dark clouds , and hii and photo - dissociation regions .",
    "it often appears to be correlated with thermal dust emission as supported by the pointed observations mentioned previously but it must be stated that this is not always the case , see for example casassus et  al .",

    "the evidence for anomalous microwave emission in compact objects is often contradictory .",
    "early observations below 10ghz of the molecular cloud lph96 ( finkbeiner et  al .",
    "2002 ) , which showed a rising spectrum were later contradicted by observations at 31 and 33ghz which found emission consistent with an optically thin free  free spectrum extrapolated from lower frequencies ( dickinson et  al .",
    "2006 ; scaife et  al .",
    "although some evidence for an excess was found in a sample of southern hii regions ( dickinson et  al .",
    "2007 ) and more significantly in rcw175 ( dickinson et  al . 2008 ) , no emission inconsistent with free  free was found in a sample of northern hii regions ( scaife et  al . 2008 ) .",

    "( 2004 ) proposed a flux density of approximately 1jy from the helix planetary nebula at 31ghz to be in excess of a free  free spectrum extrapolated from lower frequencies .",
    "however , based on flux densities from the literature at 1.4 , 2.7 , 6.63ghz ( ehman , dixon , & kraus 1970 ; higgs 1971 ; wall , wright , & bolton 1976 ) and the recent wmap 5-year densities at 2394ghz ( wright et  al .",
    "2008 ) , which are all also @xmath1jy , we suggest that there is no evidence for this reported excess in the flux density spectrum , although the nebula may be anomalous in other ways .    in this letter we present observations of the lynds dark nebula ldn1111 , taken from the ami sample of compact galactic star formation regions ( scaife et  al .",

    "ldn1111 ( @xmath2 j2000 ) lies on the inside edge of the heel of the large ( @xmath3degree ) horseshoe shaped hii region ic1396 ( sh 2 - 131 ; sharpless 1959 ) .",
    "it has no known iras association ( parker 1988 ) but has been studied in the submillimetre at 850@xmath4 m with the scuba instrument ( visser , richer & chandler 2001 ) . an opacity class 6 object ( @xmath5mag ; lynds 1962 ) , it is one of the most opaque dark nebulae .",

    "observations of ldn1111 were made in 13 hours over two days in 2007 november .",
    "data reduction was performed using the local software tool reduce .",

    ". it also applies phase and amplitude calibrations ; it then fourier transforms the correlator data to synthesize the frequency channels before output to disk in uv fits format suitable for imaging in aips .",
    "flux calibration was performed using short observations of 3c286 near the beginning and end of each run .",

    "i and ami sa measures i+q , these flux densities include corrections for the polarisation of the source derived by interpolating from vla 5 , 8 and 22ghz observations . a correction is also made for the changing intervening air mass over the observation . from other measurements , we find the flux calibration is accurate to better than 5 per cent ( scaife et  al . 2008 ; hurley ",
    "walker et  al . , in press ) .",
    "the phase was calibrated using hourly interleaved observations of the point source j2201 + 508 ( @xmath7 ) , which has a flux density of 0.3jy at 16ghz .",

    "a number of possibilities may throw some light on the nature of this excess .",
    "the thermal ( vibrational ) dust spectrum of proto - planetary disks around t - tauri stars is expected to extend into the cm - regime . in these circumstances grain growth",
    "has increased the population of cm - sized grains , or pebbles , causing @xmath17 to approach zero and the greybody spectrum to fall off with an index approaching 2 .",
    "however the size of these disks is small and would be unlikely to be resolved by either ami or scuba .",
    "ldn1111 is quite obviously elongated in the ami data , as it is in the scuba map which has a resolution of 14arcsec .",
    "although we do not deny the possibility of there being such a disk embedded within ldn 1111 or projected along the line of sight through this object , in the absence of further evidence we choose to pursue an alternative explanation .",
    "a further possibility for a superposition of ldn1111 and another object is that there may be an hii region , with a density such that it is still optically thick at 16ghz , whose flux is contributing to the spectrum .",
    "an hii region with a turn - over frequency @xmath18ghz , as would be required here , would possess an emission measure in excess of @xmath19pc @xmath20 .",
    "this would put it in the regime of ultra - compact and hyper - compact hii regions .",
    "the spectrum of these objects is inverted with an index of @xmath21 .",
    "the ami data points alone have a spectral index of @xmath22 , rather steeper than would be expected .",
    "indeed hyper - compact hii regions exhibit slightly shallower spectra ( franco et  al . 2000 ) which extends even to mm - wavelengths .",
    "the lack of a visible source in the wmap data towards ldn1111 would suggest that this is not the case here .",
    "in addition hyper - compact hii regions tend to have very broad radio recombination line ( rrl ) widths , typically in excess of 50 km s@xmath12 ( kurtz 2005 ) .",
    "ultra - compact hii regions also show broadened line widths , of typically 3040 km s@xmath12 .",
    "the rrl measurement of heiles , reach & koo ( 1996 ) which encompasses ldn1111 has a width of only 21.4 km s@xmath12 , although we note that this measurement is not directed at ldn1111 specifically .",
    "an emission measure of this magnitude would also imply an hii region mass of around 400m@xmath23 .",
    "the total mass of the cloud from the scuba data ( visser et  al .",
    "2002 ) is 0.3m@xmath23 only , which given the calculated flux loss in this data implies an upper limit on the mass of 1m@xmath23 .",
    "a third possibility for the excess emission seen in the ami data is that of dipole emission from rapidly rotating small dust grains ( drain & lazarian 1998a , b ) .",
    "the observational evidence for this emission mechanism has been explored in the introduction to this letter .",
    "it is a relatively new emission mechanism and the evidence for its existence is not conclusive .",
    "we assess the possibility that the emission seen in ldn1111 arises as a consequence of spinning dust by comparing the data to the model of draine & lazarian ( 1998a;b),which has been used extensively in the past . to make this comparison we use the mcmc based software metro ( hobson & baldwin 2004 ) to find the best  fit parameters .",
    "we fitted a model which has a free  free component normalized to give the flux density at 1.4ghz from the sampled cgps data with a spectral index of @xmath24 . to this",
    "we add a spinning dust component scaled from the dl98 molecular cloud model .",
    "the model is parameterized by the column density , @xmath25 , and the angular size of the object .",
    "visser et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) calculate the average and peak column densities for ldn1111 as 5 and 13@xmath26 , respectively .",
    "the results of our model fitting are @xmath25 = 6.72@xmath270.58@xmath28 , and @xmath29 = 5.38@xmath270.26arcmin .",
    "these values provide a @xmath30 of 1.03 ( 79% probability ) .",
    "however , given the small number of degrees of freedom in this case we do not propose this statistic as being conclusive .",
    "the resulting model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : l1111fullspec ] .",
    "the column densities agree well with those of visser et  al . ,",
    "although as might be expected there is a degeneracy between the two parameters .",
    "discussion and conclusions    given the available evidence we propose the excess of emission we see towards the dark cloud ldn1111 in the microwave band to be a result of emission from small spinning dust grains .",
    "this excess is quantified relative to a flux density derived from lower frequency data sampled to give the same @xmath16 coverage and consequently measuring the same angular scales on the sky .",
    "lacking further data at lower frequencies with suitable angular resolution this one point is the basis for the assumption that there is an excess in the ami frequency band .",
    "we therefore qualify this excess by using the original cgps data to measure the _ total power _ , i.e. power on all scales , flux density at 1.42ghz to be @xmath31mjy .",
    "since the object is extended this value may be regarded as an upper limit on the measureable flux at 1.42ghz .",
    "in addition the total power cgps data at 408mhz may then be used to constrain better the lower frequency spectrum : @xmath32mjy . the large error on this flux density",
    "is dominated by the fitting uncertainty .",
    "in combination these two flux densities yield a spectral index of @xmath33 , which predicts a _ total power _ flux at 16ghz of @xmath34mjy .",
    "this suggests that even in terms of total power there is a clear excess at 16ghz .",
    "relative to a canonical free  free spectrum extrapolated from our sampled cgps data at 1.42ghz we see an excess of @xmath35mjy , @xmath36 , assuming a fixed spectral index of @xmath24 . using the spectral index derived from the cgps total power maps at 408mhz and 1.42ghz",
    "then there is an excess of @xmath37mjy , which is still @xmath38 .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have presented observations of the lynds dark nebula ldn1111 at frequencies of 14.617.2ghz .",
    "these measurements show an excess of emission towards this object relative to an extrapolated free  free spectrum at a significance of @xmath39 .",
    "we have proposed that this excess may be due to emission from small spinning dust grains and find that it is well - described by the model of draine & lazarian ( 1998a;b ) .",
