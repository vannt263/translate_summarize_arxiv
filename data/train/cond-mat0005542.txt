    "the ability to detect and manipulate vortices with great sensivity in systems of small size such as mesoscopic superconductors @xcite or atomic condensates @xcite has generated an outgrow of interest in the mechanism of creation and annihilation of vortices and in the study of stable and metastable vortex configurations . in particular , recent advances in the technique of hall magnetometry @xcite have allowed to measure the magnetization of small superconducting samples containing only a few vortices @xcite .",
    "these experiments are conducted on aluminium disks well below the superconducting transition temperature , whereas previous measurements were performed only in the vicinity of the normal / superconductor phase boundary @xcite .",
    "besides , the magnetization measurements in @xcite are carried out on an individual disk and not on an ensemble of disks as in @xcite .",
    "the radius @xmath1 and the thickness @xmath2 of the sample used in the experiments are comparable to the superconducting characteristic lengths , _",
    "i.e. _ the london penetration length ( @xmath3 70 nm ) and the coherence length ( @xmath4250 nm ) . such a sample can neither be considered to be macroscopic , nor microscopic .",
    "the system falls , rather , in a _ mesoscopic _",
    "regime where surface effects are of the same order of magnitude as the bulk effects .",
    "thus , the magnetic response of a mesoscopic superconducting disk to an applied field depends strongly on its size and is very different from that of a macroscopic superconductor .",
    "when the radius @xmath1 of the sample is much smaller than the coherence length @xmath5 , no vortex can nucleate , the normal / superconductor phase transition is second order and the magnetization @xmath6 , as a function of the external applied field @xmath7 , has a non - linear behaviour ( non - linear meissner effect @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath1 is comparable to @xmath5 , the superconducting phase transition is first order and a bistable hysteresis region appears in the @xmath8 curve . for @xmath1",
    "greater than @xmath5 , the phase transition is again second order , and when the applied field exceeds a critical value @xmath9 , the magnetization curve exhibits a series of discontinuous jumps corresponding to the successive entry of vortices into the sample . this qualitative interpretation is supported , at least for low applied magnetic fields , by the periodicity of the jumps which corresponds to the entrance of an additional superconducting quantum of flux into the disk . for larger fields , or equivalently for higher density of vortices ,",
    "both the period and the height of the jumps become smaller , a behaviour related to the interactions between the vortices and to transitions between stable vortex configurations , with the same number of vortices .",
    "the magnetization shows also a hysteretic behaviour depending on the direction of the field sweep , due to the presence of a confining energy barrier ( the absence of remanent magnetization precludes pinning effects ) . in some metastable states ,",
    "the sample may exhibit even a paramagnetic response @xcite whereas in thermodynamic equilibrium a superconductor is diamagnetic .",
    "these experimental results have led to a renewed interest in the theory of mesoscopic superconductors .",
    "numerical computations have shown that the phenomenological ginzburg - landau theory is well suited to describe a superconducting sample in the mesoscopic regime , even far from the critical temperature .",
    "these works have revealed physical phenomena that play an important role in such systems ( for a review see @xcite ) , like : the role of surface barriers for vortex nucleation and hysteresis @xcite ; the interplay between vortex / vortex and vortex / edge interactions that explains vortex structures in mesoscopic disks @xcite ; the transition between a giant multiple vortex state and a state with several vortices carrying a unit quantum of flux @xcite .",
    "the ginzburg - landau free energy of a superconductor involves two fields , the ( complex ) order parameter @xmath10 and the vector potential @xmath11 .",
    "the minimization of this free energy leads to a set of two coupled non - linear partial differential equations for @xmath12 and @xmath11 , involving the two characteristic lengths @xmath13 and @xmath14 but the solutions depend only on one relevant number , the phenomenological ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath15 defined by @xmath16 a macroscopic superconductor is said to be of type  i if @xmath17 and of type  ii if @xmath18 a macroscopic superconductor of type ii admits a stable abrikosov vortex lattice phase when the applied field @xmath7 lies between the first penetration field and the upper critical field @xcite . for aluminium , @xmath15 is smaller than @xmath19 , hence a macroscopic sample of _ al _ is a type  i superconductor .",
    "analytical studies of the ginzburg - landau equations in two - dimensional systems require the use of various approximations since , in general , exact solutions can not be found due to the non - linearity .",
    "one approach is to linearize the equations assuming @xmath20 and to decouple them by supposing that the magnetic field @xmath21 in the sample is equal to the applied field @xmath7 .",
    "this approach describes correctly the superconducting / normal phase boundary @xcite , but fails to explain the behaviour of the sample deep inside the superconducting state .",
    "for example , in the linearized theory , all the vortices are at the center of the disk @xcite and therefore one can not study the role of surface barriers , the interaction between vortices , and the fragmentation of a giant vortex into unit vortices . besides , the critical fields corresponding to the successive entrance of vortices into the sample do not scale correctly with the size of the system ( _ e.g. _ experimentally , the entrance field @xmath9 of the first vortex scales as @xmath22 whereas the linear theory predicts a @xmath23 dependence ) .",
    "of course , in the vicinity of the upper critical field @xcite the linearized theory agrees quantitatively with the experimental results .",
    "a second approach is to use the london equation which can be derived from the ginzburg - landau equations by supposing that @xmath24 everywhere except on a finite number of isolated points , called vortices , where @xmath25 london s equation is valid rigorously when the parameter @xmath15 goes to infinity , _",
    "i.e. _ for extreme type ii superconductors in which vortices are indeed point - like .",
    "many theoretical results have been derived from the london equation , such as discrete nucleation of flux lines in a thin cylinder @xcite or in a thin disk @xcite , the existence of surface energy barriers @xcite , and the computation of polygonal ring configurations of vortices in finite samples @xcite . however , when @xmath26 the minimum energy is obtained for one flux quantum per vortex @xcite and vortices have a hard - core repulsive interaction impeding the formation of a giant vortex state . moreover , the surface energy barriers calculated from london s equation are quantitatively different from those obtained by numerically solving the ginzburg - landau equations @xcite .",
    "in fact , the experimental conditions are far off the london limit , although thin _",
    "al _ disks are likely to have an effective @xmath15 greater than its measured value @xcite of 0.28 ( in a thin disk , one can argue , following @xcite , that the effective london length is of the order of @xmath27 , and this results in a higher value of @xmath15 ) .",
    "we follow another approach , less explored in the literature , based on an exact result for the two - dimensional ginzburg - landau equations . in an infinite plane",
    "reduce to first order differential equations that can be decoupled when the parameter @xmath15 takes the special value @xmath28 called the dual point@xcite . at that point , the free energy is a topological invariant of the system . in @xcite , we generalized this method to a finite domain with boundaries ; this enabled us to classify solutions with different number of vortices and to derive analytical expressions for the free energy and the magnetization of a mesoscopic disk as a function of the applied field .",
    "our results agreed qualitatively with the experimental data , and even quantitatively when the number of vortices in the system is low .",
    "however , some important features such as the non - linear meissner effect in a fractional fluxoid disk , the variation of the amplitude and the period of the jumps in the @xmath8 curve could not be described . moreover , in @xcite , we discussed only the case where @xmath1 is much larger than @xmath5 and did not obtain the different regimes of the magnetization curve when the ratio @xmath29 is varied .    in this paper , we study the ginzburg - landau free energy @xmath30 not only at the dual point @xmath31 but also in its vicinity where vortices start to interact weakly @xcite . taking into account non - linear effects ,",
    "our calculations describe the magnetic response of the sample as its size changes , providing an understanding of the non - linear meissner effect and of the multi - vortex state .",
    "we shall also study non - equilibrium vortex configuration in order to determine the interaction between a vortex and edge currents .",
    "the plan of this paper goes as follows : in section 2 , some basic features of the ginzburg - landau theory of superconductivity are recalled . in section 3 , after studying the case of an infinite system , we generalize the bogomolnyi s approach to a finite size superconductor and calculate its free energy at the dual point .",
    "this result is applied to an infinite cylinder in section 4 .",
    "the case of a mesoscopic disk is studied in section 5 and magnetization curves are obtained for systems of different sizes . in section 6 , we obtain the free energy and the magnetization of a cylindrically symmetric system when @xmath15 is close to the dual point . the surface energy barrier for a one vortex state out of thermodynamic equilibrium",
    "is calculated in section 7 . in the last section",
    "we discuss our results and suggest some further generalizations .",
    "some mathematical details are included in the two appendices .",
    "we recall here some basic features of the ginzburg - landau theory and define our notations .",
    "the order parameter @xmath32 is a complex number and the potential vector @xmath11 satisfies @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the local magnetic induction .",
    "the two characteristic lengths @xmath13 and @xmath5 appear as phenomenological parameters . in this work ,",
    "we measure lengths in units of @xmath35 , the magnetic field in units of @xmath36 and the vector potential in units of @xmath37 where the flux quantum @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 the ginzburg - landau free energy @xmath40 , defined as the difference of the free energies @xmath41 , is measured in units of @xmath42 where @xmath43 the thermodynamic field satisfies @xmath44 . in these units , @xmath40 is given by @xmath45 where the integration is over the superconducting domain @xmath46 .",
    "the ginzburg - landau equations that minimize @xmath30 , become @xmath47 equation ( [ adgl2 ] ) is the maxwell - ampre equation with a current density @xmath48 related to the superfluid velocity @xmath49 by @xmath50 outside the superconducting sample , @xmath51 the boundary condition on the surface of the superconductor is obtained by requiring that the normal component of the current density vanishes ( superconductor / insulator boundary condition @xcite ) : @xmath52 here @xmath53 is the unit vector normal at each point to the surface of the superconductor .",
    "the london fluxoid is the quantity @xmath54 that is identical to @xmath55 .",
    "since @xmath56 is the phase of the univalued function @xmath57 the circulation of the london fluxoid along a closed contour @xmath58 is quantized @xcite : @xmath59 the integer @xmath60 is the winding number of the phase of the system along the contour @xmath58 and is a topological characteristic of the system .    in this study ,",
    "the superconducting sample is either an infinite cylinder or a thin disk , with cross - section of radius @xmath1 , placed in an external magnetic field parallel to its axis .",
    "since @xmath1 is an important parameter , we define the dimensionless quantity : @xmath61 @xmath62 is supposed to be small compared to 1 ( typically @xmath63 in the experiments ) unless stated otherwise .",
    "the flux created by the external and uniform magnetic field @xmath7 ( expressed in units of @xmath36 ) through the cross section @xmath64 of the sample is equal to @xmath65 the flux @xmath66 , in units of the flux quantum @xmath38 , is thus given by : @xmath67",
    "we emphasize that , in the units we have chosen , the flux @xmath68 of a magnetic field @xmath69 through a surface @xmath46 is obtained via the following formula : @xmath70 an extra factor @xmath71 appears here because @xmath72 is given in units of @xmath36 , the surface in units of @xmath73 and the flux in units of @xmath38 .",
    "since we are studying a superconductor in an applied external field , the relevant thermodynamic potential is the gibbs free energy @xmath74 obtained from @xmath75 via a legendre transformation : @xmath76 in a normal sample , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , the gibbs free energy @xmath79 of a normal sample is given by : @xmath80 at thermodynamic equilibrium , the superconductor selects the state of minimal gibbs free energy .",
    "the quantity that we are interested in , and which is measured in experiments , is the magnetization @xmath6 of the superconductor due to the applied field given by @xmath81 .",
    "it is obtained , at thermodynamic equilibrium and up to a constant equal to the superconducting condensation energy , from the difference of the ( dimensionless ) gibbs energies @xmath82 using the thermodynamic relation @xcite : @xmath83",
    "we now study the particular case of the dual point , defined by @xmath84 for this value of the ginzburg - landau parameter , the free energy ( [ energ ] ) of a two dimensional domain @xmath85 can be written as @xcite : @xmath86 where the operator @xmath87 is defined as @xmath88 and the second integral is over the boundary of the domain @xmath89      if we suppose that the domain @xmath85 is infinite and superconducting at large distances @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath90 at infinity , then the boundary integral in ( [ identitebog ] ) is identical to the fluxoid . using the quantization property ( [ quantize ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath91 the free energy is thus minimum when bogomolnyi equations @xcite are satisfied , that is when , @xmath92 thus , the total free energy results only from the boundary term in ( [ identitebog ] ) and is a purely topological number : @xmath93 the free energy is proportional to the number of vortices : at the dual point , vortices do not interact with each other @xcite .      in a finite system with boundaries",
    ", vortices do not interact with each other at the dual point but they are repelled by the edge currents . therefore , at thermodynamic equilibrium , all vortices collapse into a giant vortex state . since the superconductor under discussion has a circular cross - section , this giant vortex ( or _ multi - vortex _ )",
    "is located at the center and the system is invariant under cylindrical symmetry . in a _",
    "finite _ size mesoscopic superconductor at the dual point , the boundary integral , in ( [ identitebog ] ) , can not be identified with the fluxoid because @xmath94 is in general different from 1 on the boundary of the system .",
    "this quantity is no more a topological integer but a continuously varying real number .",
    "the two terms of ( [ identitebog ] ) can not , therefore , be minimized _ separately _ to obtain the optimal free energy . in @xcite , we found a method to circumvent this difficulty : if the system is invariant under cylindrical symmetry , _ i.e. _ all the vortices are at the center of the disk , then the current density has only an azimuthal component @xmath95 .",
    "the current @xmath95 has opposite signs near the center ( where the vortex is located ) and at the edge of the disk ( where meissner currents oppose the penetration of the external field ) .",
    "hence , there exists a circle @xmath96 on which @xmath95 vanishes @xcite . along @xmath96 , we have @xmath97 the domain @xmath46 can thus be divided into two sub - regions , @xmath98 such that the boundary between @xmath99 and @xmath100 is the circle @xmath96 . by convention , we call @xmath99 the bulk and the annular ring @xmath100 the boundary region ( see figure 1 ) .    numerical solutions of the ginzburg - landau equations in a two dimensional superconductor , with cylindrical symmetry , clearly show the separation of the sample cross - section into two distinct subdomains . in figure 2",
    ", we have plotted the order parameter and the magnetic field in a cylinder of radius @xmath101 with one vortex at the center .",
    "these two quantities vary only near the center and near the edge : there is a whole intermediate region in which @xmath94 and @xmath72 remain almost constant .",
    "when the system is large enough , these constant values are , to an excellent precision , identical to the asymptotic values of @xmath94 and @xmath72 in an infinite system .",
    "the current vanishes for a value of @xmath102 for which @xmath103 , and this determines the radius of the circle @xmath104 in figure 2 , this corresponds approximately to @xmath105 , though practically , the circle @xmath96 can be placed anywhere in the saturation region where the current is infinitesimally small .",
    "although the bogomolnyi equations ( [ equabogo1 ] , [ equabogo2 ] ) do not minimize the ginzburg - landau free energy @xcite , we notice that the behaviour of @xmath94 and @xmath72 in the bulk subdomain @xmath99 is still given by the relation @xmath106([equabogo2 ] ) which , as shown in figure 3 , represents indeed an excellent approximation .",
    "thus , using ( [ identitebog ] ) and ( [ ptegam ] ) , we conclude that at the dual point the free energy of @xmath99 can be calculated as that of an infinite domain , namely @xmath107 we also emphasize that the flux in @xmath99 is quantized and one has : @xmath108    to calculate @xmath109 , the identity ( [ identitebog ] ) valid at the dual point is of no use anymore , since @xmath94 is in general different from 1 at the boundary , and the boundary integral in ( [ identitebog ] ) can not be identified to the fluxoid .",
    "we therefore have to go back to the definition ( [ energ ] ) of the ginzburg - landau free energy which becomes at the dual point : @xmath110 the assumption of cylindrical symmetry implies that @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the polar angle and @xmath60 the number of vortices present at the center of the disk .",
    "examining again figure 2 , we observe that in @xmath113 , the order parameter and the magnetic field vary from their values on the edge to their saturation values over a region of width @xmath114 , which is of order 1 in units of @xmath115 at the dual point . for a thin film of thickness @xmath116 @xmath117 in the london limit @xcite .",
    "since we are considering a mesoscopic regime in which @xmath118 , both expressions indicate that @xmath114 is of order 1 . ]",
    "the length @xmath114 therefore represents the typical distance over which the integrand in ( [ exp2 ] ) has a non negligible value .    with the help of this observation , we shall estimate @xmath109 using a variational ansatz : we shall consider that the modulus of the order parameter has a constant value @xmath119 over a ring of width @xmath114 , included in @xmath120 and that @xmath11 and @xmath34 decay exponentially with a characteristic length @xmath114 from their boundary value to their bulk value .",
    "clearly , our approximation will be valid only if the width of @xmath113 is large enough compared to 1 .",
    "we first remark that our ansatz is compatible with the boundary condition ( [ bondcond ] ) , which reduces here to @xmath121 and that it allows us to neglect the curvature term @xmath122 in ( [ exp2 ] ) . to evaluate the term proportional to the superfluid velocity @xmath123 ( [ vsuper ] ) , we first notice that , due to the meissner effect , it decreases from the boundary at @xmath124 with a behaviour well described by @xmath125 with @xmath126 . to obtain the last equality we used that the boundary value of the vector potential is @xmath127 where @xmath68 is the total flux through the system .",
    "hence , for a constant amplitude @xmath119 of the order parameter , we have @xmath128    the magnetic contribution in ( [ exp2 ] ) is obtained from the typical magnitude @xmath129 of the magnetic field in @xmath113 determined using ( [ defflux ] ) and ( [ flux1 ] ) as @xmath130 thus , using the fact that @xmath131 decrease exponentially with a characteristic length @xmath132 , we estimate the contribution of the magnetic energy to @xmath133 as being : @xmath134 after substituting this expression into ( [ avecb ] ) we minimize @xmath109 with respect to @xmath119 .",
    "the optimal variational value of @xmath119 is given by : @xmath135 inserting these expressions in ( [ avecb ] ) , we obtain the variational free energy @xmath133 : @xmath136 with @xmath137 and @xmath72 defined by @xmath138    the total free energy of the mesoscopic superconductor containing @xmath60 vortices , at the dual point , is thus : @xmath139    this energy is the sum of two contributions :    \\(i ) a _ bulk _ term proportional to @xmath60 which is a topological quantity at the dual point .",
    "\\(ii ) a _ boundary _ term , reminiscent of the well - known ` little and parks ' free energy @xcite ( this boundary term can be given a geometric interpretation in terms of a geodesic curvature @xcite ) .",
    "we now apply the relations ( [ enlibre ] ) to the simple case of an infinitely long superconducting cylinder of radius @xmath140 , lying in an external field @xmath7 directed along its axis .",
    "there are two contributions to the total flux @xmath68 : the flux of @xmath60 vortices present at the center of the sample and a fraction of the applied flux @xmath141 localized near the boundary and proportional to @xmath142 ( due to the meissner effect ) .",
    "hence , @xmath143 the exact numerical coefficient in front of the term @xmath144 does not affect the result of our calculation ; we take it equal to 2 , the value obtained in the london limit @xcite . the total free energy , using ( [ enlibre ] ) and the fact that @xmath145 , is given by @xmath146 using ( [ gibbsener ] ) and ( [ energcyl ] ) , the gibbs free energy , @xmath147 of a cylinder containing @xmath60 vortices at the dual point is given by : @xmath148 where @xmath149 is a polynomial in @xmath150 that does not depend on @xmath60 . hence , all the curves @xmath151 meet at @xmath152 for values of @xmath153 less than this critical value , the free energy is minimized if there are no vortices . at @xmath154",
    "all vortices are nucleated simultaneously and the sample becomes normal .",
    "this value corresponds to a critical applied field @xmath7 which is equal to 1 in our units , or restoring the units back , and recalling that @xmath155 @xmath156 this is precisely the formula for the thermodynamic critical field of a superconductor @xcite ( which , for a cylindrical superconductor with @xmath157 is the same as the upper critical field ) .",
    "the magnetization @xmath6 of the cylinder satisfies the linear meissner effect : @xmath158 the macroscopic result @xcite is @xmath159 ; the finite - size correction to the susceptibility is proportional to @xmath160 .",
    "thus , the well - known results for an infinite superconducting cylinder can easily be retrieved from the dual point approach .",
    "we now proceed to the study of the magnetic response of a thin disk .",
    "to modelize the experimental sample of @xcite , we consider a mesoscopic disk of thickness @xmath2 smaller than @xmath5 and @xmath13 . because the disk is very thin",
    ", we take the order parameter and the magnetic field to be constant across the thickness @xmath2 of the sample @xcite .",
    "this enables us to study the disk as an effective two - dimensional system .",
    "however , unlike the case of a long cylindrical sample , strong demagnetization effects are present in a thin disk .",
    "the value of @xmath72 near the edge of the disk is larger than the applied field @xmath7 because geometric demagnetization effects induce a distortion of the flux lines @xcite .",
    "hence the continuity condition @xmath161 ( [ fluxcyl ] ) valid for a long cylinder does not apply to describe a thin disk .    in order to find a more suitable choice for the boundary condition for a thin disk",
    ", we notice that the higher value of the magnetic field at the boundary , a feature which has been obtained from numerical computations @xcite , results from a demagnetization factor @xmath162 close to one , such that @xcite @xmath163 in the meissner phase .",
    "the flux lines are distorted by the sample and they pile up near the edge of the disk . to describe this , we shall thus take as boundary condition for a thin disk , the expression proposed in @xcite , which consists in taking the potential - vector at the edge of the disk equal to its applied value , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath164 or @xmath165 again , this relation does not mean that the field @xmath72 is uniform and equal to its external strength . a more refined value for the boundary condition could have been obtained by using the expression @xmath166 in the limit @xmath167 of a flat disk .",
    "then , @xmath168 or equivalently @xmath169 .",
    "but , since @xmath170 , we shall use for convenience the simpler boundary condition given above .    substituting @xmath171 in ( [ enlibre ] )",
    ", the free energy @xmath172 of a thin disk containing @xmath60 vortices is found to be @xmath173 and the corresponding gibbs free energy is obtained using ( [ gsgn ] ) . in our previous work @xcite , we obtained an expression which can be retrieved from ( [ energdisk ] ) by taking @xmath174 and by neglecting the magnetic energy as well as the @xmath175 term . despite these crude approximations",
    ", our analytical results agreed satisfactorily with experimental data , though they could not describe neither the behaviour of a disk with a radius smaller than @xmath13 and @xmath5 , nor its behaviour when @xmath1 is increased .",
    "we apply our present approach to a thin disk with a radius @xmath1 much smaller than @xmath5 , and then we consider the case @xmath176      we now consider a disk small enough so that no vortices can nucleate _",
    "i.e. _ its radius @xmath1 is less than @xmath177 ( such a system is sometimes called a _ fractional fluxoid _",
    "disk @xcite ) .",
    "if there are no vortices , the domain @xmath178 is empty and @xmath179 . since the radius of @xmath46 is small with respect to both @xmath13 and @xmath5 , we can no more use the expression ( [ energdisk ] ) for the free energy , but we can assume that the amplitude @xmath94 of the order parameter has a uniform value @xmath119 all over the disk and that the magnetic field equals the external applied field @xmath78 .",
    "moreover , in the absence of vortices @xmath180 and we can choose the landau gauge @xmath181 .",
    "starting from ( [ exp2 ] ) , and after minimizing the free energy with respect to @xmath119 , we find the difference between the free energies of the superconducting and the normal states to be : @xmath182 from ( [ magthermo ] ) we deduce the magnetization @xmath6 of the sample : @xmath183 the curve representing this magnetization is a cubic .",
    "the upper critical field is @xmath184 , i.e. @xmath185 ; this scaling agrees with the linear analysis of @xcite in the limit @xmath186 .",
    "the transition between the superconducting phase and the normal phase is of second order . in figure 4",
    ", we plot the relation ( [ mag0 ] ) for @xmath187 as a function of the external flux @xmath66 .",
    "the dots represent the experimental points obtained from @xcite . the analytical curve has been scaled so that the maximum value of the magnetization and the critical flux coincide with the corresponding experimental data .",
    "we now consider a disk with @xmath188 .",
    "the gibbs free energy difference @xmath189 of the disk with @xmath60 vortices is given by ( [ gsgn ] ) .",
    "the entrance field @xmath190 of the @xmath60-th vortex is obtained by solving the equation @xmath191 which , using ( [ energdisk ] ) , reduces to @xmath192 using the following change of variable @xmath193 we obtain an equation for @xmath194 @xmath195 ( a term @xmath196 has been neglected in comparison to 1 ) .",
    "the solution of ( [ eqy ] ) that satisfies @xmath197 ( because @xmath198 ) depends on the value of the parameter @xmath114 .",
    "one can show that the polynomial @xmath199 always has a positive root .",
    "we retain only the smaller positive root @xmath200 of ( [ eqy ] ) because in thermodynamic equilibrium , the system always chooses the state with minimal gibbs free energy . restoring the usual units , and using ( [ chgt ] ) ,",
    "the nucleation fields are found to be : @xmath201 when the applied field @xmath7 lies between @xmath190 and @xmath202 , the disk contains exactly @xmath60 vortices and its magnetization is calculated using ( [ magthermo ] ) . in figure 5 , we have plotted the magnetization of a mesoscopic disk with @xmath203 both from exact numerical solutions of the ginzburg - landau equations and from the expression ( [ magthermo ] ) .",
    "the agreement is very satisfactory . for larger values of the number @xmath60 of vortices , a discrepancy between the theoretical and the numerical expressions appears which results from the interaction between the vortices and the edge currents that we have neglected until now .",
    "the expression ( [ enlibre ] ) is also in good agreement with previous experimental and numerical results @xcite .",
    "a non - linear meissner behaviour still exists before the nucleation of the first vortex as well as between successive jumps .",
    "the field @xmath204 of nucleation of the first vortex scales as @xmath160 .",
    "the transition between a state with @xmath60 vortices to a state with @xmath205 vortices is of first order since the entrance of a new vortex induces a jump in the magnetization .",
    "these jumps are of constant height and have a period @xmath206 .",
    "if we use the experimental values of @xcite for @xmath1 and @xmath13 we obtain a value for the period of the jumps which is in very good agreement with the experimental value .",
    "if @xmath1 is smaller than a threshold value , the system is a fractional fluxoid disk with a second order phase transition .",
    "if @xmath207 , a vortex can nucleate in the disk and a first order transition occurs .",
    "when @xmath1 increases , the number of jumps increases ( as @xmath208 ) .",
    "these qualitative changes of behaviour with increasing @xmath1 , which are the important features obtained from the present model , have been indeed observed in experiments carried out on disks of different sizes . in an earlier study @xcite , we obtained satisfactory values for the nucleation fields but the fractional fluxoid disk , and the different regimes obtained by increasing @xmath1 could not be explained because we neglected subdominant terms that are retained here .",
    "it has been observed experimentally that the period and the height of the jumps cease to be constant when the number of vortices increases .",
    "these effects are related both to interactions between the vortices and between vortices and edge currents .",
    "the purpose of the next section is to take into account these interactions and to obtain a better estimate for the free energy and the magnetization of a mesoscopic disk .",
    "so far we have obtained analytical expressions for the free energy and the magnetization of a thin superconducting disk _ at the dual point .",
    "_ when the ginzburg - landau parameter has the special value , @xmath209 vortices do not interact .",
    "this fact , discussed in @xcite , implies that the bulk free energy does not depend on the location of the vortices .",
    "however , when @xmath15 is away from the dual point , the vortices start interacting among themselves ; therefore the bulk free energy ceases to be a purely topological integer @xmath60 and the vortex interaction energy must be taken into account .",
    "because of this interaction the vortices are no longer necessarily placed at the center of the disk : in an equilibrium configuration , the cylindrical symmetry can be broken and the optimal free energy may correspond to geometrical patterns such as regular polygons , polygons with a vortex at the center , or even rings of polygons @xcite .",
    "it is the competition between the interaction amongst vortices and the interaction between vortices and edge currents that determines the shape of the equilibrium configuration .",
    "analytical studies were mostly carried out in the limit @xmath210 and were based on the london equation @xcite for which vortices are point - like and have a hard - core repulsion @xcite .",
    "we shall study a regime where @xmath15 is slightly different than @xmath19 , _",
    "i.e. _ a regime where vortices interact _ weakly_. we shall determine , to the leading order in @xmath211 the interaction energy of the vortices .      in order to obtain an estimate for the free energy of a system of interacting vortices ,",
    "we have solved numerically the ginzburg - landau equations for a cylindrically symmetric infinite system with @xmath60 vortices located at the center ( these equations are explicitly written in appendix a ) . the free energy per vortex is plotted in figure 6 as a function of @xmath15 , for @xmath212 and 10 . at the dual point , the free energy per vortex is equal to 1 and is independent of @xmath60 : all the curves pass through this point . when @xmath15 is different from @xmath19 the interaction between the vortices changes the value of the free energy .",
    "one can deduce from figure 6 that vortices attract each other for @xmath15 less than @xmath19 while they repel each other when @xmath213    from our numerical results we observed that in the vicinity of the dual point , the free energy @xmath214 satisfies the following scaling behaviour : @xmath215 we note that the relation ( [ fscaling ] ) is exact at the dual point .",
    "for @xmath216 , @xmath217 is nothing but the self energy @xmath218 of a vortex . in the vicinity of the dual point we can write :",
    "@xmath219 the values of the function @xmath220 , as determined from numerical computations , for @xmath60 ranging from 1 to 30 are given in the table [ alpha ] .",
    "we can now derive an approximation for the free energy of a @xmath60 vortices configuration located at the center of the disk and for @xmath15 close to @xmath221 since this configuration is cylindrically symmetric , one can again use the circle @xmath96 to separate the system into two subdomains @xmath178 and @xmath113 and then estimate separately the two contributions to the total free energy . from our numerical scaling result",
    ", we deduce a formula for the bulk free energy of a finite system which is valid for @xmath15 close to the dual point . expanding ( [ fscaling ] ) in the vicinity of the dual point",
    ", we obtain : @xmath222 and the boundary contribution , obtained via a variational ansatz is now given by : @xmath223 where @xmath137 is still given by the relation ( [ ab ] ) while @xmath224 is now given by @xmath225 .",
    "the magnetization curve of figure 7 shows both the numerical results and a plot of the magnetization deduced from ( [ pertbord ] ) using ( [ magthermo ] ) .",
    "we notice that the magnetization of a mesoscopic disk is modified when the interactions between vortices are taken into account .",
    "the period and the amplitude of the jumps are not constant anymore ; besides , the non - linearity of the curve between two successive jumps is enhanced . these important features of the @xmath8 curve were observed in previous experimental and numerical results @xcite . here",
    "we have shown that these features are a consequence of vortex interactions .",
    "the exponent @xmath220 in the relations ( [ fscaling ] ) or ( [ scalingbulk ] ) allows to describe the interacting potential between vortices .",
    "it is interesting to compare the result ( [ fscaling ] ) with the energy of @xmath60 vortices obtained by assuming a two - body interaction . in this case",
    "the energy of the whole system of @xmath60 vortices can be written as a sum of two terms @xmath226 where @xmath227 represents , as noted before , the self - energy of a vortex and @xmath228 the two body interaction potential . using the data of @xcite",
    ", we can estimate these two energies to the leading order in @xmath229 .",
    "we obtained : @xmath230 with @xmath231 and @xmath232 . from this analysis , and assuming only two - body interaction , we derive an approximate value for the free energy of a configuration with @xmath60 vortices placed at the same point : @xmath233 if we compare this relation to the previous expression ( [ scalingbulk ] ) we find that instead of the sublinear function @xmath220 we have a linear behaviour @xmath234 .",
    "hence , the function @xmath220 takes into account not only two - body interactions among vortices but also multiple interactions which are present for values of @xmath15 around the dual point unlike the large @xmath15 limit where only the two - body contribution remains .",
    "in this section , we calculate the energy at the dual point of a system with only one vortex that is not located at the center of the disk . such a configuration is not in thermodynamic equilibrium and its free energy can be related to a surface energy barrier ( analogous to the classical bean - livingston barrier in the london limit ) .",
    "we first show that even when the cylindrical symmetry is broken , the system can still be separated into bulk and edge domains .",
    "we have seen in section [ sectgamma ] that when one or more vortices are located at the center of the disk , there exists a circle @xmath96 on which the current vanishes identically .",
    "this circle allowed us to define a bulk and an edge domain and to identify the bulk energy with the fluxoid .",
    "if all the vortices are not placed at the center of the disk ( _ i.e. _ the configuration is not cylindrically symmetric ) there is in general no curve of zero current .",
    "however the curve @xmath96 has now the following property : at each point @xmath6 of @xmath96 the current @xmath235 is normal to @xmath96 .",
    "the existence of such a curve is shown by the following argument .",
    "consider a disk with only one vortex @xmath236 situated at a point different from the center of the disk .",
    "take a line segment joining the vortex @xmath236 to the closest point @xmath237 on the boundary of the disk ( see figure 8) .",
    "the component of the current density normal to the @xmath238 segment changes its sign when one goes from @xmath236 to @xmath237 .",
    "hence , there exists a point @xmath6 along this segment where the current either vanishes or is parallel to @xmath239 to draw the curve @xmath96 we start from @xmath6 in a direction orthogonal to the @xmath238 segment , and then @xmath96 is constructed via infinitesimal steps by imposing that at a point @xmath240 , very close to @xmath6 , the direction of @xmath96 is orthogonal to the direction of the current at @xmath241    although we lack a general proof , we believe on topological grounds that for vortices at arbitrary positions , there always exists a @xmath96 curve which is everywhere orthogonal to the current ( one should note that @xmath96 does not necessarily have only one connected component ) . in @xcite , we shall present a numerical construction of @xmath104 in the sequel of this work we assume that @xmath96 exists , that it encircles all the vortices , and consists of one or many simple closed curves .",
    "we shall call the curve @xmath96 _ the separatrix .",
    "_    using @xmath242 the domain @xmath46 can be decomposed in two regions @xmath178 and @xmath113 such that :    \\(i ) @xmath243 ;    \\(ii ) @xmath178 contains all the vortices ( @xmath178 may have multiply connected components ) ;    \\(iiii ) @xmath113 contains the edge of the disk ;    \\(iv ) the separatrix @xmath96 is the boundary between @xmath178 and @xmath113 and is everywhere normal to the current density .",
    "the remarkable property of the separatrix implies that along @xmath96 one can write : @xmath244 since along @xmath96 , @xmath245 .",
    "since the separatrix is the boundary of @xmath178 , the property ( [ separatrix ] ) ensures that the total magnetic flux through @xmath178 is quantized .",
    "hence , at the dual point , we can again use the method of bogomolnyi and find the free energy of @xmath178 to be a purely topological number , just as for an infinite domain , even if the cylindrical symmetry is broken .      as",
    "before , we estimate the contribution @xmath133 to the total free energy via a variational ansatz , taking the modulus of the order parameter to be constant . to obtain a qualitative result for the surface energy barrier we neglect the magnetic energy so that , at the dual point , we have : @xmath246 where @xmath247 is the superfluid velocity square averaged over the boundary of the disk .",
    "as before , we have replaced the integral over @xmath113 by a line integral along the boundary of the sample ( _ i.e. _ the disk of radius @xmath1 ) multiplied by an effective length @xmath248 the function @xmath56 appearing in ( [ edg1 ] ) is the phase of the order parameter , and the vector potential is taken , as before , to its value on the boundary of the sample .",
    "optimizing ( [ edg1 ] ) with respect to @xmath119 we find that : @xmath249 for @xmath250 .",
    "the phase function @xmath56 and the vector potential near the edge of the disk are calculated in appendix b. using these results , we obtain ( for n=1 ) : @xmath251 the function @xmath252 determines the dependance of the free energy on the position @xmath253 of the vortex ; hence , it measures the interaction energy between the edge currents and the vortex as a function of its position .",
    "it is given by @xmath254 from this expression , we observe that the edge currents tend to confine the vortex inside the system . in figure 9 the surface energy as a function of the position @xmath253 of the vortex is plotted . according to ( [ optpsi ] ) ,",
    "only the increasing part of the curve is physical .",
    "we nevertheless plot the curve defined by ( [ barriere ] ) in the whole range @xmath255 in order to emphasize the similarity between our result and the well - known bean - livingston surface barrier effect that was first derived using the london theory @xcite .",
    "in this work , we have obtained analytical results for the free energy and the magnetization of a mesoscopic superconductor .",
    "we have used a known exact solution for the two dimensional ginzburg - landau equations in an infinite plane , valid at the dual point , to study a finite system with boundaries . with the help of numerical simulations ,",
    "we have carried out a perturbative calculation in the vicinity of the dual point .",
    "this approach enabled us to study thermodynamically stable states but also metastable states ( to obtain a surface energy barrier ) .",
    "this model gives theoretical insights into the physical mechanisms involved in the experimental results of @xcite and our analytical results agree quantitatively with experimental measurements .",
    "in fact , other related thermodynamic quantities such as the surface tension measuring the thermodynamic stability of vortex states can also be computed along this way and could generalize to two - dimensional systems previous results obtained in one dimension @xcite .    more generally , we believe that a theoretical study in the vicinity of the dual point provides a lot of information about the ginzburg - landau equations .",
    "although one usually relies on exact results derived from london s equation , one should be aware of the fact that these results agree with numerical simulations of ginzburg - landau equations only when @xmath15 is large ( typically @xmath256 we verified that the behaviour we found in the vicinity of the dual point , such as the scaling of the free energy , remains valid when @xmath15 ranges from 0.1 to 10 and this interval of values is indeed relevant for many conventional superconductors .",
    "our study can be extended in many directions .",
    "the scaling results in the vicinity of @xmath155 were derived from numerical simulations : a systematic perturbative expansion around the dual point would put them on a more rigorous basis .",
    "secondly , a linear stability analysis of the cylindrically symmetrical solution @xcite should allow to understand the fragmentation transition between a giant vortex and unit vortices .",
    "since the separatrix @xmath96 exists even for vortex configurations breaking cylindrical symmetry , our approach can be used to analyze hysteretic behaviour of metastable states , and to study polygonal vortex configurations found numerically in mesoscopic superconductors @xcite .",
    "it is pleasure to thank g. dunne for numerous discussions . k.m . would like to express his gratitude to s. mallick for his constant help during the preparation of this work and to thank a. lemaitre for many interesting discussions . during the completion of this work",

    "for a cylindrically symmetric system , we can use @xmath257 and @xmath258 where @xmath60 is a non - negative integer which represents the number of vortices at the center of the system .",
    "we also define the superfluid velocity @xmath259 , where @xmath260 in this case the ginzburg - landau equations are : @xmath261 it is convenient to define the quantity @xmath262 . the magnetic field @xmath263 is given in terms of @xmath264 by @xmath265",
    "we obtain finally two coupled ordinary differential equations @xmath266 with the following boundary conditions at @xmath267 for @xmath268 : @xmath269 for a disk and @xmath270 for a cylinder .",
    "these are the equations we have solved numerically using the relaxation method @xcite . from the analysis of the equations ( [ appgl2 ] ) we deduce the following behaviour in the vicinity of the center of the disk : @xmath271    the free energy ( [ energ ] )",
    "is then given in terms of the solution of ( [ appgl2 ] ) by @xmath272",
    "in this appendix we measure the distances in units of @xmath1 , so the disk has unit radius .",
