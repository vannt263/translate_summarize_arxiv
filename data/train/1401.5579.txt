    "in studies of core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) , the equation of state ( eos ) of hot dense nuclear matter is one of the essential ingredients , and it has been developed in parallel with the progress of the research on core - collapse sne . in the early stages of these studies ,",
    "simple , analytically expressed nuclear eoss were adopted , and the influence of the stiffness parameters included in the eoss on the sn explosion was discussed @xcite .",
    "hillebrandt and wolff adopted a more realistic nuclear model : they constructed a nuclear eos table based on the skyrme ",
    " fock approach @xcite .",
    "after this study , lattimer and swesty ( ls ) @xcite provided an eos for sn ( sn - eos ) with use of a skyrme - type interaction for uniform matter and a compressible liquid - drop model for non - uniform matter : this eos has been widely adopted in numerical studies of sne .",
    "about ten years later , shen et al .",
    "@xcite constructed a new nuclear eos based on the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory : in their studies , non - uniform nuclear matter is treated in the thomas  fermi ( tf ) approximation . the shen eos was provided as a table of thermodynamic quantities over an extremely wide range of densities , temperatures and proton fractions , and has been utilized conveniently in complicated numerical simulations of sne . in recent years",
    ", the shen eos has been extended so as to take into account hyperons @xcite and quarks @xcite .",
    "in addition , rmf lagrangians different from that adopted in the shen eos have been applied to the sn - eos @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the eos of non - uniform matter has also been improved : instead of the single - nucleus approximation adopted in the ls eos and the shen eos , multiple nuclides are taken into account in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in these eoss ,",
    "as mentioned above , uniform matter is treated with phenomenological nuclear models . since the nuclear eos is governed by nuclear forces , it is desirable for nuclear eoss constructed with many - body calculations starting from bare nuclear forces to be directly applied to sne .",
    "in fact , nuclear eoss of this type have been calculated for uniform matter , especially at zero temperature , and have been applied to the study of cold neutron stars ( cnss ) .",
    "however , studies of the eos of hot asymmetric nuclear matter starting from bare nuclear forces are limited .",
    "it is also noted that , in the case of the shen eos , the parameter set of the rmf lagrangian called tm1@xcite is determined so that scalar and vector potentials of nuclear matter are close to those obtained by the dirac",
    " brueckner ",
    "fock calculations @xcite with the nuclear potential bonn a , but the bonn a potential is not directly adopted in the shen eos . to our knowledge , there has been no study in which eoss with microscopic many - body theories starting from bare nuclear forces have been applied directly to sn numerical simulations .    toward a more microscopic nuclear eos , therefore , we are now constructing a new type of sn - eos based on the realistic nuclear forces using the variational many - body theory .",
    "as the first step of our project , we have performed variational calculations starting from the argonne v18 ( av18 ) two - body nuclear potential @xcite and the urbana ix ( uix ) three - body potential @xcite for hot asymmetric nuclear matter , as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this calculation , we have adopted a relatively simple cluster variational method in order to treat asymmetric nuclear matter , because the more sophisticated fermi hypernetted chain ( fhnc ) variational method is hardly applicable to asymmetric nuclear matter . in spite of the large difference in the degree of sophistication between these two methods ,",
    "the obtained ( free ) energies per nucleon for symmetric nuclear matter and neutron matter in the present eos are in good agreement with those obtained with the fhnc calculations performed by akmal et al .",
    "( apr ) @xcite at zero temperature and by mukherjee @xcite at finite temperatures .",
    "we are now at the stage of applying the uniform nuclear eos based on the cluster variational method to core - collapse sne ; this application is the main aim of the study described in this paper .",
    "as the first step of our application , we perform general - relativistic , spherically symmetric hydrodynamic numerical simulations of sne , and compare the results using the variational eos with those using the shen eos as a reference sn - eos . here",
    ", we consider two sn simulations with and without neutrino transfer . without the neutrino transfer ,",
    "the weak reaction is switched off , and then the electron fraction of each fluid element is fixed during the simulation .",
    "namely , the proton fractions of fluid elements are determined by the initial progenitor model , resulting in relatively large proton fractions , and then the dynamics is governed by the nuclear eos with those large proton fractions .",
    "therefore , the simulation without the neutrino transfer is not only suitable as a test of the application of our eos to sn numerical codes , but also valuable as a study of the properties of the eos with large proton fractions , though such a case is rather hypothetical . then , as a more realistic case , we perform the sn simulation with the neutrino transfer by taking into account the weak reactions . in this case",
    ", the electron fraction decreases significantly by neutrino emissions , and then the eos of neutron - rich nuclear matter plays an important role in the simulation .",
    "it is well known that , in general , the sn explosion is not successful in spherically symmetric calculations .",
    "we note that a successful 1d explosion has been reported for a progenitor of a low - mass star with an o  ne  mg core in refs .",
    "we consider here the collapse of the iron core of a massive star . in this case , 2 or",
    "3d simulations are inevitably required in order to describe convection , which is an essential dynamical mode to ensure that fluid elements stay in the heating region longer to gain more energy from the neutrinos emitted from the inside of the core .",
    "in addition , the standing accretion shock instability mainly promoting dipole oscillation of the shock wave around proto - neutron stars ( pnss ) , which is found in multi - dimensional core - collapse simulations , may be advantageous for stellar explosions ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "although these multi - dimensional effects can not be treated in the spherically symmetric simulations , they become important at relatively late stages of the sn explosions . in the early stages of sne ,",
    "the gravitational collapse of the iron core of the progenitor and the subsequent core bounce , where the eos of dense uniform matter plays essential roles , are well approximated in the spherically symmetric simulations .",
    "therefore , as the first step of the application of the variational eos to sne , the spherically symmetric hydrodynamic simulation is appropriate .    in order to perform the sn simulation",
    ", we also need a non - uniform eos : the sn - eos must cover an extremely wide range of densities , temperatures , and proton fractions , in contrast with the case of cnss .",
    "we adopt , for simplicity , the non - uniform part of the shen eos , and connect it to the variational eos for uniform matter in the sn simulations .    in the next section ,",
    "we review the uniform nuclear eos adopted in this paper , and discuss some of the thermodynamic quantities of uniform isentropic sn matter with the variational eos . in sect .  3",
    ", we apply the variational eos to a spherically symmetric general - relativistic hydrodynamical calculation of a core - collapse sn without the weak reactions . in sect .  4",
    ", we apply the variational eos to a more realistic sn simulation taking into account neutrino transfer . a summary and concluding remarks are given in sect .  5 .",

    "the correlation functions are determined through the minimization of @xmath2 under the extended mayer s condition and the healing distance condition : the former is a kind of normalization condition and the latter introduces a healing distance for the correlation functions .",
    "we assume that the healing distance is proportional to the mean distance between nucleons , and the coefficient is chosen so that the obtained @xmath2 of symmetric nuclear matter and neutron matter are close to those obtained with the fhnc method by apr .",
    "the energy caused by the three - body force , @xmath8 , is constructed based on the expectation value of the three - body hamiltonian with the degenerate fermi - gas wave function . here , with use of the uncertainty of the three - body force ,",
    "the strength of the repulsive and two - pion - exchange components of the uix potential are modified and a correction term , which is an explicit function of the nucleon number density @xmath9 and the proton fraction @xmath5 , is added somewhat phenomenologically .",
    "the values of the four parameters included in @xmath8 are chosen so that the total energy per nucleon @xmath10 reproduces the empirical saturation density @xmath11 , saturation energy @xmath12 , incompressibility @xmath13 , and symmetry energy @xmath14",
    ". furthermore , these parameters in @xmath8 are fine - tuned so that the thomas  fermi calculations of isolated atomic nuclei with the present @xmath15 reproduce the gross features of their experimental masses and radii , as reported in ref .",
    "the obtained values for the present eos are @xmath16 @xmath17 , @xmath18 mev , @xmath19 mev , and @xmath20 mev @xcite .",
    "we note that the uncertainties in the empirical values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 are relatively large .",
    "the above - mentioned value of @xmath13 is consistent with @xmath21 mev deduced from the measurements of the isoscalar giant monopole resonance in medium - mass nuclei , as reported in refs .",

    "the obtained @xmath15 for symmetric nuclear matter and neutron matter are in good agreement with the results of apr .",
    "in addition , the density dependence of the symmetry energy is consistent with the experimental data on heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have constructed the eos of non - uniform matter at zero temperature with the tf calculation using the wigner ",
    "seitz approximation , and applied it to cns crusts @xcite .",

    "the time evolution of the general - relativistic fluid elements is solved implicitly so that long - term calculations with a large time step are possible .",

    "@xcite to perform sn simulations with the shen eos for various progenitor models in order to study the eos of dense matter in dynamical situations , in addition to the study of the progenitor dependence of the sn hydrodynamics .",
    "since one of our main purposes is to achieve the first application of the variational eos to the sn hydrodynamic calculations , we choose a typical presupernova model , i.e. , the 15 @xmath24 model calculated by woosley and weaver @xcite . in this case , the mass of the iron core is 1.32 @xmath24 . in the hydrodynamical simulations , following the study of ref .",

    "as the simplest case of the sn simulations , we perform an adiabatic hydrodynamic calculation . in this case , the weak interaction is switched off , and then the electron fraction @xmath54 of each fluid element does not change throughout the simulation .",
    "since neutrinos are absent in the initial progenitor model , they do not appear throughout the simulation , and then there is no energy flow due to neutrino transfer in the sn matter , i.e. , the evolution of the sn matter is adiabatic .",
    "since @xmath54 of each fluid element is maintained at the initial value , which is about 0.40.5 , the dynamics of the sn is governed by the nuclear eos with relatively large values of the proton fraction @xmath5 : we examine the effect of the variational eos with such @xmath5 on the sn hydrodynamics .",

    ", the matter falls toward the center of the core , and the corresponding velocity profile consists of an inner self - similar collapse and an outer free fall .",
    "as the density of the matter approaches saturation density ( 59 ) , the matter becomes stiffer , and then the falling materials decelerate to create an outgoing pressure wave .",
    "when the decelerated fluid elements bounce to attain positive velocities ( 10 ) , a shock wave is created .",

    "this figure shows that , before the bounce , the trajectory of each fluid element falling toward the center of the iron core with the present eos is completely the same as that with the shen eos , because the matter is not yet uniform .",
    "when the density of the matter becomes close to the nuclear saturation density around the time of the bounce , the trajectories with the present eos deviate from those with the shen eos .",
    "in fact , at the bounce , it is seen in this figure that the lowest curves , corresponding to the innermost grid points , fall to smaller radii with the present eos than those with the shen eos .",
    "this implies that the present eos is softer than the shen eos in this adiabatic case ( relatively large values of @xmath5 ) .",
    "after the shock wave is launched outward , the fluid elements in the inner region of the core stagnate to form a pns and those in the outer region of the core keep moving outward .",
    "it is seen that the radii at which the fluid elements with the present eos stagnate are slightly smaller than those with the shen eos , i.e. , the pns born at the center of the core with the present eos is more compact , releasing more gravitational energy due to the relative softness of the present eos .",
    "owing to this larger energy release , the fluid elements with the present eos at larger radii move outward faster than those with the shen eos , and , correspondingly , the shock wave propagates faster . finally , the shock waves reach the edges of the iron cores in both cases : this occurs 11 ms after the bounce with the variational eos , which is 1 ms faster than that with the shen eos .",
    "this implies that , in both cases , the explosions are successful in this adiabatic approximation .",
    "in fact , most of the gravitational energy released by the core collapse is converted into the internal energy of the core and the kinetic energy of the fluid elements in the outer region .",
    "although some of the energy is consumed by photodisintegration of iron when the shock wave propagates across the outer region of the core , the released energy is large enough to overcome such an energy loss .",

    "therefore , we have not discussed the behavior of the emitted neutrinos , such as their energy spectra or luminosities : these quantities are largely affected by the compositions of the sn matter in the non - uniform region where we use the shen eos in the present calculations .    since the present eos is consistent with the observational data on cold neutron stars ( both the masses and radii ) @xcite and provides larger explosion energy than the shen eos ,",

    "before further advancing those applications and extensions , however , an eos of non - uniform matter self - consistently based on the variational eos must inevitably be constructed .",
    "in fact , the eos of non - uniform matter determines the initial condition , electron capture rates , dynamics of the collapsing core , and various neutrino reactions at later stages after bounce , in the sn simulations .",
