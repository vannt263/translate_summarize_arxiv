    "high energy gamma ray astronomy experiments , such as the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) h.e.s.s .",
    ", magic , veritas and cangaroo , and extensive air shower arrays such as milagro , argo , and tibet array , have revealed a large number of sources with emissions extending to above a few tens of tev ( for a collection of results see @xcite ) .",
    "the fermi gamma - ray space telescope , launched in june 2008 , has already produced first catalogues for sources emitting @xmath0  mev photons @xcite .",
    "tev gamma ray sources include galactic supernova remnants , pulsars , and microquasars , as well as extragalactic gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "gamma ray fluxes produced by many of these sources are time dependent .",
    "high energy photon observations of agn reveal flaring activities on timescales of hours to several weeks , with intensities often several times larger than the typical flux of the source in its quiescent state .",
    "these flares are yet unpredictable .",
    "grbs have burst timescales ranging from milliseconds to a few minutes @xcite that are still not fully explained . on the other hand ,",
    "some of the time dependent emissions are more predictable .",
    "for instance , binary systems are naturally periodic .",
    "tev photon fluxes from the microquasars ls i + 61 303 and ls 5039 , for example , are modulated by the orbital phase of the system @xcite .",
    "no high energy extraterrestrial neutrino sources have been discovered , but potential sources include high energy gamma ray sources .",
    "neutrino fluxes can be similarly time dependent if neutrinos and gamma rays originate from meson decays produced in hadronic processes ( interactions of protons or nuclei with matter or environmental photons near sources ) . during agn flares , it is possible that an enhanced emission on top of that produced by electromagnetic mechanisms , such as synchrotron radiation and inverse compton , is due to an increase in proton acceleration efficiency in jets @xcite .",
    "the periodicity of microquasar photon emissions suggests that any neutrino emission may be similarly periodic .",
    "the central statistical challenge in high energy astronomy is the identification of event excesses due to sources amongst random background fluctuations .",
    "features that differentiate the signal emission from the background are used in this process , namely directional and energy information .",
    "another distinguishing feature is time .",
    "for example , if a burst is observed in a photon experiment , one can test for a coincident neutrino emission .",
    "a much better background rejection , and thus a better sensitivity , is achieved by selecting only events near the time of the flare or burst .",
    "furthermore , one may wish to search for time dependent sources without a corresponding trigger from another experiment by testing if a cluster of events in time is incompatible with the random time distribution of the background .",
    "we call these searches untriggered , since they do not use information from other experiments . such untriggered searches ( e.g. @xcite ) use time - variable or rolling time bins to identify excesses , and generally outperform time - independent searches if the signal events are indeed clustered in time . in ref",
    ".  @xcite , we demonstrated that binned methods are not as effective as unbinned methods based on maximum likelihood techniques , which describe the signal and background using probability density functions ( pdfs ) , and we applied this method to a simulated search for high energy neutrino point sources in a cherenkov neutrino telescope .",
    "such methods have been applied in astroparticle point source searches @xcite .    here , we extend this method to search for point sources with time - dependent fluxes , incorporating a time - dependent term into the signal and background pdfs .",
    "we first review binned methods in sec .",
    "[ sec : bin ] , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] we describe an unbinned method to search for bursts , flares , and other cases when the nature of the time dependence can be assumed from observations of other experiments .",
    "we then describe a method for an untriggered search , when the burst time and duration are not known . in sections",
    "[ sec : results ] and [ sec : results2 ] , we apply the methods to a simulated neutrino search and characterize the discovery potential of these methods as a function of the burst duration .",
    "the data in high energy astronomy consist of a set of events distributed throughout a region of the sky , and can be modeled by two hypotheses : either the data consist solely of background events , i.e. the null hypothesis , or the data additionally contains a signal from an astrophysical source . the signal and background event distributions",
    "are governed by pdfs , describing the event angular distribution , energy spectrum , time distribution , etc .",
    "any difference between the signal and background pdfs provides an opportunity to differentiate events produced by an astrophysical source from the background .",
    "binned and unbinned methods use these pdfs in different ways .",
    "for example , events from an astrophysical point source cluster around the location of the source with an angular deviation given by the detector point spread function , which often is approximately a 2-d gaussian . when using binned methods to evaluate whether a source is present at a given location @xmath1 in an event sky map , @xmath2 events can be selected within an angular bin comparable in size to the detector angular resolution and centered on @xmath1 , and @xmath2 is then compared to the expected background using poisson or binomial statistics .",
    "if the probability of obtaining @xmath2 or more events from background alone is less than a given confidence level threshold , e.g. 5@xmath3 ( @xmath4=5.73@xmath510@xmath6 ) , we reject the null hypothesis and decide that a source is present in the data .",
    "the mean number of signal events necessary to reject the null hypothesis in a given fraction of trials ( e.g. 50% ) at the given cl is the discovery potential , a figure of merit for the search .",
    "additional information may be present in other variables characterizing the data .",
    "particularly , if the signal events are clustered on a small timescale of approximately @xmath7 t relative to the duration of the experiment t , applying a time selection in addition to the angular selection reduces the background by a factor @xmath8@xmath7t / t and can significantly improve the discovery potential .",
    "a gain is similarly possible with an energy - based selection if the energy spectra of potential sources are significantly different from the background .",
    "binned methods are easy to implement and computationally fast .",
    "criticisms of binned methods and other methods incorporating an event selection are generally the following :    * * the information reduction problem*. all of the event information is reduced to a binary classification ; either the event passes the selection and is counted , or it does not .",
    "a fraction of potential signal events is always lost .",
    "additionally , information contained within the event distribution is lost that alternatively could indicate the relative agreement of each event with signal or background .",
    "for example , events at the edge of a search bin are not as indicative of a point source as events near the center , but are counted the same .",
    "finally , classes of signal events may have substantially different angular resolution ; e.g. in many cases in astroparticle physics , high energy events are reconstructed more accurately . by applying the same angular bin size for all events ,",
    "binned methods fail to dynamically incorporate such information . *",
    "* the optimization problem*. the event selection , including the angular bin radius , must be optimized given a specific point source signal hypothesis .",
    "for instance , a binned analysis optimized to discover fluxes with hard energy spectra may be far from optimal for sources with softer energy spectra .",
    "the selection often needs to be reoptimized to test a different hypothesis , which can be problematic , particularly when the analysis is performed adhering to blindness principles . additionally , the selection which optimizes sensitivity @xcite ( i.e. set the best limits ) generally does not maximize discovery potential , and therefore usually one or the other is sacrificed .",
    "unbinned methods model the data as a two component mixture of signal and background and fit the data to determine the relative contribution of each component .",
    "the general procedure is as follows .",
    "events are selected from a region surrounding the source , considerably larger than the detector angular resolution .",
    "given @xmath2 events in the data set , the probability density of the i@xmath9 event is @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the signal and background pdfs , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 is the unknown contribution of signal events .",
    "the likelihood of the data given @xmath13 is the product of the event probability densities : events @xcite .",
    "this term is not necessary when the background is determined from off - source data and sufficient off - source events are included in @xmath2 . ]",
    "\\label{eq : lh}\\ ] ] the likelihood is then maximized with respect to @xmath13 and other free parameters , giving the best fit value @xmath15 .",
    "the maximization can be done numerically with e.g. minuit @xcite or equivalently with the expectation - maximization technique @xcite .",
    "the null hypothesis is given by @xmath16 and is nested within the allowed parameter space .",
    "the standard likelihood ratio test statistic is @xmath17 \\times \\text{sign}(\\hat{n}_s ) , \\label{eq : ts}\\ ] ] where the factor @xmath18 differentiates between negative and positive excesses .",
    "the obtained value of @xmath19 is then compared to the distribution of @xmath19 given the null hypothesis .",
    "large values of @xmath19 reject the null hypothesis with a confidence level equal to the fraction of the distribution above the obtained @xmath19 , and discovery potential is calculated as described in section [ sec : bin ] .",
    "suppose we wish to test for the existence of a neutrino point source at a given location @xmath1 .",
    "we assume the neutrino emission from the source should follow a time distribution with a known functional form .",
    "the unbinned signal pdf is the product of independent space angle , energy , and time probability terms : @xmath20 for an event with reconstructed direction @xmath21 , we model the probability of originating from the source , with a space angle difference @xmath22 , as a 2-d gaussian : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the angular resolution of the 2-d gaussian ( i.e. 39.3% of @xmath25 are equal to or less than @xmath24 ) . in many applications ,",
    "@xmath24 can be determined for each event individually @xcite , or alternatively , @xmath24 can be determined from monte carlo simulations . since angular resolution is generally energy dependent , the ability to use individual @xmath24 ensures the independence of the spatial and energy terms in the signal pdf .",
    "the energy pdf @xmath26 describes the probability of obtaining a reconstructed energy e@xmath27 for an event produced by a source of a given energy spectrum .",
    "the typical expectation of an e@xmath28 power - law energy spectrum for astrophysical neutrino sources ( characteristic of fermi acceleration mechanisms ) results in an excess of higher energy signal events compared with the background of atmospheric neutrinos ( @xmath8e@xmath29 spectrum above 100 gev ) .",
    "this information makes it easier to identify a signal for harder spectra , and therefore fewer events are needed for a significant detection .",
    "we assume the source energy spectrum follows a power law @xmath30@xmath8e@xmath31 with spectral index @xmath32 . since we do not know the exact spectral index of the source",
    ", we allow @xmath32 to be a free parameter in our model . as in @xcite",

    "we then fit @xmath32 along with @xmath13 in the likelihood maximization .",
    "we have found that the use of the energy term improves the discovery potential significantly in time - independent neutrino point source searches , and , if enough signal events are present , the best fit spectral index @xmath35 provides a reasonable measurement of the source spectral index @xcite .",
    "the time pdf @xmath36 describes the time distribution of events observed from the source . in this case",
    ", we assume the time distribution from photon observations .",
    "for example , we could search for the high energy neutrino counterpart to an orphan tev photon flare of an agn by using the lightcurve measured by an iact during the flare as a pdf , or we can look for high energy neutrinos in coincidence with mev  ",
    "gev photon observations of a grb .",
    "alternatively , we can use long - term agn lightcurves to investigate if similar variations of neutrino and photon fluxes are observed , for example using fermi - lat daily monitoring .",
    "we consider , as an example , flares with gaussian time dependence : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the gaussian mean time and gaussian width of the burst , respectively , which are assumed to be known .",
    "we add the term @xmath40 , which describes the detector efficiency at the source location as a function of time .",
    "particularly , detector efficiency is often dependent on zenith and azimuth angles and is zero when the detector is off or @xmath1 is outside the detector field of view .",
    "the time pdf @xmath36 must be normalized to unity while including this efficiency term .",
    "for this work , we consider uniform efficiency , i.e. @xmath40=1 .    including all terms ,",
    "the signal pdf is : @xmath41 the background pdf @xmath12 contains the same three terms , describing the angular , energy , and time distributions of background events : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the probability of obtaining @xmath44 from atmospheric neutrinos , t@xmath45 is the livetime of the data set , and @xmath46 is the solid angle of a declination band centered on the declination of the source and containing @xmath2 total events ( in this work , we have used bands of @xmath476@xmath48 ) .",

    "it is necessary to search the data for excesses with respect to time .",
    "binned methods designed to detect untriggered transient signals are well known .",
    "for example , if the duration of the burst is assumed , a sliding time window can be used @xcite .",

    "all possible groups of consecutive events within the angular search bin are considered , and the most unlikely group ( with respect to the background time distribution ) is chosen as a burst candidate .",

    "the functional form of the time dependent signal is additionally not known .",
    "nonetheless , low statistics signals producing a small number of recorded events contain little information on the details of these functions and can be fit equally well by a range of functional forms .",

    "[ sec : mtd1 ] and [ sec : mtd2 ] can be similarly used to search for periodic emissions from sources with well - known periodicity by searching with respect to the orbital phase of the system rather than time .",

    "a component of the tev photon emissions from these sources is modulated according to the orbital phase of the system @xcite .",
