    "we find that the @xmath62-shell bin contains approximately 87% of the ipsm strength independent of @xmath7 over that range .",
    "although the @xmath75-shell bin appears to carry almost 100% of ipsm , independent of @xmath7 , there is evidence in the momentum distribution for a significant continuum that artificially increases the @xmath9 normalization factor for two - component fits mixing @xmath8 and @xmath118 contributions .",
    "therefore , we consider the @xmath5 contribution to the @xmath88 mev bin to be the most reliable estimate of the depletion of ipsm orbitals by short - range correlations ; the occupancy of 87% is consistent with estimates based upon the self - consistent green s function method and with recent direct measurements of the correlated continuum using parallel kinematics @xcite .    we have also analyzed the same low @xmath7 data sets used by lapikas _",
    "@xcite to study the @xmath7 dependence of normalization factors for @xmath0c@xmath1 .",
    "we find that the rdwia calculations for dirac - hartree wave functions reproduce the low @xmath7 data for quasiperpendicular kinematics well , but with somewhat smaller normalization factors .",
    "for example , the @xmath5 normalization factors for two saclay experiments were 0.63 and 0.75 using nlsh wave functions and edad1 optical potentials , compared with 0.87 for the jlab data .",
    "however , the same model fails to reproduce low @xmath7 data for parallel kinematics and remediation of this problem will require more than a multiplicative factor .",
    "similar problems in previous nrdwia analyses prompted van der steenhoven _",
    "@xcite to adjust the woods - saxon wave function , the optical potential , and an empirical enhancement of the transverse components of the current simultaneously .",
    "although a better fit was achieved , this wave function does not reproduce the data for quasiperpendicular kinematics for either early low @xmath7 experiments or the more recent high @xmath7 experiments .",
    "the momentum distributions for the fitted woods - saxon wave functions are too narrow , which artificially reduces the normalization factors fit to data .",
    "thus , lapikas _ et al . _",
    "@xcite obtained a @xmath5 normalization factor of only 0.56 for @xmath12 ( gev/@xmath3)@xmath4 and suggested that spectroscopic factors might depend strongly upon the resolution of the probe .",
    "we argue that spectroscopic factors are properties of nuclear structure that are independent of probe , but that the effective current operator for single - nucleon knockout may include additional @xmath7 dependencies beyond those in familiar off - shell extrapolations of the free nucleon current operator . on the other hand ,",
    "the additional @xmath7 dependence is probably smaller than their estimate .",
    "further investigation is needed to explain the discrepancy between parallel and quasiperpendicular kinematics at low @xmath7  we believe that it is unwise to fit the momentum distribution to data with a strong variation of @xmath119 in the absence of a more fundamental theory of the effective current operator .    finally , we found that rdwia calculations of nuclear transparency need to be multiplied by approximately 1.12 to reproduce data for @xmath0c and attribute much of this enhanced transparency to contributions to the continuum for @xmath93 mev that are not directly related to single - nucleon knockout , such as multinucleon electromagnetic currents .",
    "however , a more detailed model of the continuum is need to distinguish between contributions due to multinucleon currents and rescattering processes .",

    "<S> although the rdwia normalization factors for @xmath12 ( gev/@xmath3)@xmath4 are also smaller than obtained for @xmath6 ( gev/@xmath3)@xmath4 , the effect is smaller and we argue that it should be attributed to the effective single - nucleon current operator instead of to spectroscopic factors which are probe - independent properties of nuclear structure . however , remediation of the failure of rdwia calculations to reproduce low @xmath7 data for parallel kinematics will require a more sophisticated modification of the current than a simple multiplicative factor . </S>"
