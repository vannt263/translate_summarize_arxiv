    "recent observational data @xcite indicate that the universe contains a significant fraction ( @xmath0% ) of dark matter whose origin is still unclear . a possible solution to",
    "this problem comes from supersymmetric ( susy ) models in the form of neutralino @xcite .",
    "neutralino is the lightest supersymmetric partner in susy , with the mass of about @xmath1gev , and is stable .",
    "it interacts with the gravitational and weak interactions only , which indicates that it is `` dark '' .",
    "weak interactions and neutralino mass are sufficient to satisfy the relic density needed to explain the observed portion of the dark matter in the universe .    in a remarkable recent study @xcite , a detailed distribution of dark matter as a function of the redshift in a part of our universe",
    "was obtained .",
    "these observations indicate that dark matter plays a role of a scaffolding upon which ordinary matter builds structures .",
    "however , the observations show that large pockets with only dark matter ( and no ordinary matter ) also exist .",
    "then a natural question arises whether compact objects like planets , stars or maybe even larger structures made exclusively of dark matter can exist .",
    "recent study discussed the existence of stars powered by annihilation of neutralinos @xcite .",
    "however , these objects contain mostly baryons and only several percents of dark matter .",
    "compact objects made of pure dark matter were discussed in @xcite .",
    "there it was assumed that the equilibrium of these stars was supported by the fermi pressure .",
    "it was argued that the size of such a dark matter star is less than @xmath2 m with the mass less than @xmath3 , if neutralino mass is around @xmath1gev @xcite .",
    "since the density inside a neutralino star is very high , neutralinos collide frequently .",
    "these earlier studies used the estimate that identical non - interacting fermions have elastic cross section of about @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is de broglie thermal wavelength @xcite . with this assumption ,",
    "non - relativistic neutralinos have the elastic cross section which is much larger than the weak interaction cross section . if this claim is indeed correct , than a thermal neutralino star could exist , since neutralino annihilation can be neglected in this case .",
    "however , it is unlikely that the neutralino elastic cross section is as large as @xmath4 .",
    "for example , the large elastic cross section would directly contradict the recent `` bullet cluster '' observations @xcite .",
    "it is therefore very important to explicitly check this fact .    in order to achieve a thermal distribution",
    ", the lifetime of a particle has to be much longer than the characteristic interaction time .",
    "stable neutralinos could in principle achieve thermal state in cosmological context .",
    "however , at high densities annihilation can not be neglected .",
    "a necessary condition for the thermal equilibrium among neutralinos ( at densities smaller than @xmath6gev@xmath7 ) is that the neutralino - neutralino elastic cross section is much larger than the neutralino - neutralino annihilation cross section .",
    "in this section , we will explicitly calculate and compare the neutralino - neutralino elastic and annihilation cross sections .",
    "we will show that they are comparable , i.e. of the same order of magnitude .",
    "this implies that neutralinos can not be in a thermal equilibrium in a compact object .",
    "after several encounters they will annihilate and be converted into the standard model particles",
    ". the thermal state of neutralions can not be reached .",
    "thus , the neutralinos can not be described by the the fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "this then indicates that compact objects made only of neutralinos and supported by the fermi pressure can not exist .    in susy ,",
    "the neutralinos @xmath8 are the mixed states of the neutral higgsinos , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and the neutral gauginos , binos ( @xmath11 ) and winos ( @xmath12 ) @xcite .",
    "the mixing and mass matrices are given by    @xmath13    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the matrix that diagonalizes the mass matrix .",
    "parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are mass parameters in the potential , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the vacuum expectation values of the two higgsions , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are sinus and cosinus of the weak angle , while @xmath23 is the electron charge .",
    "the matrix @xmath15 also defines the mixing between the states @xmath24 @xmath25 here , @xmath26 .",
    "neutralino @xmath27 is presumably the lightest supersymmetric particle , and can not decay into other supersymmetric particles .",
    "because of the r - parity conservation , it can not decay into the standard model particles either .",
    "therefore , neutralino is stable .",
    "the only way to destroy neutralinos is annihilation .",
    "the cross section for the two - particle final state is @xmath28 in our case , both particle a and particle b are neutralinos . in an elastic collision ,",
    "particles @xmath2 and @xmath29 are neutralinos . in an annihilation process",
    ", particles @xmath2 and @xmath29 are the standard model particles .",
    "@xmath30 is a momentum of the particle @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 are velocities of particles a and b respectively . @xmath33 and @xmath34 are energies of particles @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "@xmath37 is the scattering amplitude .",
    "if the two incoming neutralinos have non - relativistic velocities , say @xmath38km / s , then the momentum @xmath30 of the light standard model particle ( except maybe for the top quark ) in an annihilation process is about @xmath39 times larger than the momentum @xmath30 of the neutralino in an elastic collision .",
    "thus , only for highly relativistic incoming neutralinos elastic collisions will have @xmath30 of the same order of magnitude as an annihilation process .",
    "since for various different channels all of the parameters are fixed , except for the amplitude , in what follows we compare the amplitudes only .",

    "top quark can not be in the final state for kinematic reasons .",

    "( [ cs ] ) .",
    "in this section we quantify our arguments about the non - existence of the star made of pure neutralinos by treating the pauli exclusion force as a real interaction between the fermions ( different than the weak interaction ) .",
    "first we will show that the mean free path for the interaction caused by the pauli exclusion force must be shorter than the distance between fermions if the fermi pressure is to provide stability . to show this , we consider a general setup like in fig .  [ collision ] .",

    "throughout the star the condition ( [ cond ] ) is violated .",
    "the ratio @xmath135 drops sharply only near the surface of the star.,width=307 ]    one may roughly estimate the ratio between the standard model particles and neutralinos which is needed to stabilize the star .",
    "this ratio will depend on the mean free path for neutralino annihilation and that of the standard model particles . for a condition ( [ cond ] ) to hold , the mean free path of the standard model particles",
    "can not be greater than several percents of the mean free path for neutralino annihilation .",
    "this implies that the neutralino content in the star can not be greater than a few percents .    finally , we comment on the interplay between gravity and annihilations .",
    "gravity brings neutralinos together , but annihilations put an upper limit to the density of ( pure ) dark matter clumps . even without detailed numerical simulations we can perform a simple order of magnitude estimate .",
    "consider for example a neutralino clump that was presumably created when the galaxy was formed , and survived till now .",
    "the density of the clump can be calculated from the condition @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the lifetime of a galaxy  about @xmath138 gyrs , while the velocity of dark matter is assumed to be @xmath1 km / s .",

    "we find that the number density of the clump must be lower than @xmath139 gev@xmath140 @xmath141 m@xmath142 , which for a @xmath1gev neutralino gives the mass density of @xmath143g / cm@xmath140 . for more general constraints",
    ", one would need to perform detailed numerical simulations of the gravitational collapse with annihilations included .",
    "in conclusions , we studied here whether pure dark mater can make compact objects like stars .",
    "the study was motivated by the remarkable recent observations @xcite that there are regions in our universe with pure dark matter distribution without the visible presence of the ordinary matter .",
    "we explicitly calculated and compared the neutralino elastic cross section with the annihilation cross section and found them to be comparable .",
    "this means that , in each encounter , neutralinos have about the same chance to annihilate into the standard model particle or to be scattered . if they are scattered , they exchange energy and momentum and after many repeated encounters will reach the thermal equilibrium",
    ". however , annihilation will prevent this scenario from happening .",
    "once neutralions get converted into the standard model particles they can not come back .",
    "this situation can not be described by the fermi - dirac equation of state .",
    "this implies that a stable neutralino star supported by the fermi pressure can not exists .    to substantiate our arguments , by solving oppenheimer - volkoff equation we constructed a model of the star made of pure neutralinos .",
    "we explicitly showed that the condition for the thermal equilibrium supported by the fermi pressure is never fulfilled inside the star .",
    "we also estimated that a stable star can not contain more than a few percents of neutralinos , most of the mass must be in the form of the standard model particles .",
    "this may have implications for the question why we are made of the standard model particles if most of the matter in the universe comes in the form of dark matter .",
    "for intelligent observers like us to evolve , structures like stars and planets are ( perhaps ) necessary .",
    "one of the possibilities to have neutralinos in thermal equilibrium is an environment with enormous densities , of the order of @xmath6gev@xmath7 .",
    "if such an environment is thermalized , then its temperature is of the order of the rest mass of the neutralino . in this case",
    "neutralinos can be produced thermally .",
    "this can only happen in early universe or in the central core of a very dense star . in the case of the central core of a star ,",
    "this region must be very tiny , with the radius smaller than @xmath2 cm @xcite .",
    "again , such an object can not be supported by the fermi pressure .",
    "the annihilation process would be so quick that the star could not exist long enough to be observed .",
    "the other possibility to have neutralinos in thermal equilibrium is an environment with very low densities . in an environment where the neutralino density is so low that neutralinos barely collide with each other ,",
    "their effective lifetime is much longer than the weak - scale characteristic collision time . in such conditions",
    ", gravitational cooling may bring neutralinos to equilibrium .",
    "this is the mechanism behind dark matter halo formation .",
    "however , these are rather low density dark matter distributions and can not be called compact objects . at higher densities gravitational scattering can not compete with weak interactions .",
    "therefore , gravitational cooling may bring neutralinos together but can not play an important role in the subsequent evolution of the compact object .",
    "we assumed here that the dark matter is comprised of neutralinos .",
    "however , any particle with the mass around the weak energy scale and weak scale interaction cross section ( such is neutralino ) automatically has a relic density which satisfies observational constraints .",
    "thus , we expect that the same conclusions will hold for more general models . therefore , despite the fact that regions in our universe with the pure dark matter distribution were observed , compact objects like planets , stars and larger systems like galaxies made of dark matter are unlike to exist .",
    "we also note that we used the dark matter models in their most standard form . in some exotic models ,",
    "dark matter particles with an extra self - interaction @xcite were considered to solve the problems with subhaloes @xcite , cuspy cores @xcite and recent apparent pamela @xcite , atic @xcite and fermi @xcite observations . in the context of these models ,",
    "this extra self - interaction has to be properly included .",

    "<S> motivated by the recent  cosmos project \" observation of dark - matter concentrations with no ordinary matter in the same place , we study the question of the existence of compact objects made of pure dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the dark matter is neutralino , and compare its elastic and annihilation cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the two cross sections are of the same order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> this result has a straightforward and important consequence that neutralinos comprising a compact object can not achieve thermal equilibrium . to substantiate our arguments , by solving oppenheimer - volkoff equation we constructed a model of the star made of pure neutralinos . </S>",
    "<S> we explicitly showed that the condition for the thermal equilibrium supported by the fermi pressure is never fulfilled inside the star . </S>",
    "<S> this neutralino state can not be described by the fermi - dirac distribution . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a stable neutralino star , which is supported by the fermi pressure , can not exist . </S>",
    "<S> we also estimated that a stable star can not contain more than a few percents of neutralinos , most of the mass must be in the form of the standard model particles . </S>"
