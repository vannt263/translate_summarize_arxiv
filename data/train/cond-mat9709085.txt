    "the recent growth of @xmath29 single crystals in @xmath30 crucibles has ushered in a new generation of ultra - pure samples @xcite .",
    "this growth method avoids the critical problem of crucible corrosion and leads to single crystals with extremely clean surfaces and purity exceeding @xmath31 .",
    "in contrast , the best crystals grown in conventional crucibles like @xmath32 and yttria - stabilized - zirconia @xmath33 have final reported purities of @xmath34 @xcite a  number of experiments on @xmath15 crystals have revealed new features which are either greatly suppressed or not present in @xmath35 samples .",
    "we have recently observed novel features in the microwave surface impedance of @xmath15 which clearly indicates the presence of two superconducting components @xcite .    in this paper , we present further evidence on the systematics in three @xmath2 crystals . the results obtained confirm our earlier findings @xcite , _ viz . _ : ( 1 ) a new conductivity peak in @xmath7 around 80k which is correlated with the normal state scattering rate and ( 2 ) extra pairing below 65k in addition to onset of pairing below the bulk @xmath36 of @xmath13 as revealed in @xmath37 . _ a single complex order parameter can not describe these data and the data indicate the presence of at least two pairing processes , leading to at least two op components_. model calculations considering various simple two - component scenarios ( decoupled @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) and are presented .",

    "overall , our results show that _ a pure @xmath43 state does not occur in @xmath1 _ and strongly suggest the presence of multiple pairing energies in @xmath44.we note that several microscopic pairing scenarios are consistent with the conclusions of this paper .",
    "one of the causes for the presence of impurities in @xmath29 single crystals is the random substitution at the @xmath45 chain sites by trace amounts of crucible constituents like @xmath32 during the melt growth process .",
    "this results in local variation of oxygen vacancy distribution , introduction of magnetic moments and other local defects @xcite .",
    "although the overall @xmath46 and sharpness of the superconducting transition may not be affected by a combination of these elements associated with impurities , important features of the superconducting ground state like the order parameter symmetry , scattering , superfluid density etc .",

    ", the normal electrons have damping with the usual drude conductivity at high frequencies , and the superconducting electrons have inertia but no damping .",
    "the quasiparticle and pair conductivities can be numerically calculated from :    @xmath99    where @xmath100 , and @xmath101 is the gap parameter , and @xmath102 indicates an angular average over @xmath103 .",
    "the gap parameters are given by @xmath104 and @xmath105 for s - wave and d - wave superconductors respectively .",

    "the validity of this two - fluid approach , which is used frequently in s - wave superconductors following mattis & bardeen @xcite , has been discussed for d - wave superconductors by hirschfeld , _ et.al .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "we now discuss the comparison of the experimental data with detailed models which are implemented assuming various conditions for the gap parameters .",
    "there is a general consensus that the superconducting order parameter symmetry in cuprates is not a simple @xmath108-wave type as is the case in conventional superconductors .",
    "a wealth of experimental results indicate unconventional pairing and more specifically point to the presence of nodes in the gap . a strong candidate which has been found",
    "to account for most of the properties in cuprates is the theory of @xmath109-wave superconductivity .",
    "a single complex @xmath109-wave order parameter has been proposed with a gap of the form : @xmath110 where @xmath103 specifies the orientation of the two - dimensional momentum of the cooper pairs .",
    "this expression leads to two important signatures , namely , the order parameter goes to zero in certain @xmath111 directions and also changes sign as one goes around the fermi surface .",
    "angle - resolved photoemission @xcite and phase sensitive squid experiments @xcite have shown strong evidence for this behavior . for experiments which measure quantities averaged over @xmath111-space ( like the microwave penetration depth ) ,",
    "the consequence of the @xmath109-wave gap will lead to features in the low temperature dependence which should be consistent with the presence of a finite density of states within the gap .",
    "a linear low temperature dependence in ybco single crystals first observed by ubc group @xcite ( and subsequently confirmed by others including ourselves in @xmath4 @xcite and also @xmath112 @xcite ) has been claimed as prime evidence for nodes in the gap , which applies to @xmath109-wave symmetry among other possibilities .",
    "rigorous calculations of the microwave conductivity in the framework of @xmath24wave theories have also been done to explain the features observed in prior @xmath35 samples @xcite .    in fig.[n_s1 ] , a plot of @xmath113 vs. reduced temperature @xmath114 for @xmath40 single crystals is shown .",
    "a comparison to detailed d - wave calculations has been carried out by us in an earlier publication @xcite .",
    "comparison shows that although the low temperature dependence is reproduced by calculations ( not shown ) using a weak coupling @xmath24wave order parameter , the agreement is not very good at temperatures @xmath115 , suggesting that strong coupling effects are needed .    for the @xmath15 single crystals ,",
    "the low temperature penetration depth @xmath116 is indeed linear for all 3 samples measured up to @xmath117 with a characteristic slope @xmath118 of about @xmath119 , similar to that of the @xmath40 samples .",
    "however deviation from linearity is observed above @xmath120 for the @xmath15 crystals due to the onset of the broad @xmath70 bump .",
    "this is clearly evident from the plots of @xmath37 presented in fig.[sigmas ] which shows a non - monotonic dependence for ae103 , ae180 and ae105 samples when compared to the aexx curve .",
    "while a single order parameter may be reconciled at first glance for the @xmath40 data @xcite , it is impossible to do so for the results on the @xmath121 grown crystals @xcite .",
    "instead a two - component model has to be considered as is done below .",
    "the simplest way in which one can analyze a two - component system is to consider two parallel superconducting channels and to add their complex conductivities .",
    "the total conductivity can then be written as :    @xmath122    for ease of calculation we consider that the two components are decoupled with distinct transition temperatures , @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "( we emphasize that in all likelihood the components are coupled , and furthermore there is only one phase transition at @xmath125 , with @xmath123 more of a crossover temperature , as discussed later ) .",
    "calculations of the conductivities can be performed using the mattis - bardeen formalism introduced earlier . in an earlier paper , we had presented the qualitative model where for ease of calculation we used @xmath126wave order parameters for both the @xmath25 and @xmath26 components @xcite . in reality",
    ", it is essential to choose at least one component to be @xmath24wave to produce the linear low temperature dependence . using a combination of @xmath108 and @xmath109 gap symmetries ,",
    "it is possible to obtain excellent quantitative fits to the observed experimental data for all the @xmath15 single crystals .",
    "fig.[bzofit ] shows the experimental data for @xmath127 and @xmath128 along with the fits obtained with the two component model assuming an ( s+d ) case for the a and b components .",
    "good fits can also be obtained for ( d+d ) and ( d+s ) cases for the two components .",
    "the data for the ae103 sample only is presented in the figures for clarity .",
    "it is possible to obtain similar fits for the other @xmath15 crystals and the fit parameters for all the samples are tabulated in table ii .",
    "a good agreement between the data and model is obvious .",
    "best fits are obtained for the following _ generic _ choices :    1 .   a low temperature component @xmath25 with @xmath129 and a high temperature component @xmath26 with @xmath130 2 .   a weak coupling @xmath24 wave gap with @xmath131 for the the @xmath132 component and an @xmath126wave gap with @xmath133 or a weak - coupling @xmath24 wave gap for the @xmath134 component .",

    "@xmath42_. _",
    "the two - component model also provides an explanation of the @xmath40 data as can be seen from fig.[yszfit ] .",
    "the fit parameters ( table i ) suggest that impurities suppress the order parameter for the a component(a smaller ratio 10% of the superfluid density @xmath140 as well as a weaker gap @xmath141 are needed ) , as well as greatly enhancing the scattering rate @xmath142 about 10 times larger for the b component .",
    "the rapid variation of @xmath138 below @xmath143 is still needed to obtain the @xmath9 peak in @xmath7 for the @xmath40 crystals .",
    "the occurence of the low temperature normal conductivity peak in @xmath144 at around @xmath9 , even though the superconducting transition temperatures are in excess of @xmath145 in @xmath4 crystals , has long been a puzzling feature .",
    "an exponential reduction of the quasiparticle scattering rate below @xmath12 was invoked to account for this .",
    "however , the present data provides an explanation for the location of this peak , since in the present experimental results , it is natural to associate the two @xmath88 peaks with the corresponding features in the pair condensate density as inferred from @xmath146 .",
    "two types of pairing with different characteristic energy scales are clearly observed in these high quality @xmath15 single crystals . in the @xmath40 samples ,",
    "these energy scales are also present but their signatures are obscured by impurity scattering .",
    "one aspect of the comparison should be noted .",
    "because we have used a model in which the components are decoupled , the calculations necessarily show a sharp break at around @xmath147 , whereas the data display a smooth crossover .",
    "this is an indication that the decoupled model is too simplistic , and a coupled model is necessary .",
    "indeed such calculations performed @xcite within a ginzburg - landau framework lead to a smooth crossover in @xmath148 in closer agreement with the experiments .",
    "however a full calculation of the conductivities requires a microscopic model which still needs to be implemented .",
    "( see also the remarks in the summary section of this paper ) .",
    "we note that there have been other discussions of multiple components ( gaps or quasiparticles ) in the cuprate superconductors .",
    "a two - gap model was proposed earlier by klein et al .",
    "@xcite to describe the data on @xmath149 thin films with low cation disorder . in their case , however , low and high gaps both with @xmath126wave symmetry and the same @xmath12 were chosen to calculate the pair conductivity and the issue of @xmath88 was not addressed in detail .",
    "two - component behavior in @xmath150 and underdoped @xmath151 compounds have also been reported in raman @xcite and femtosecond optical response @xcite .",

    "the similarity between @xmath156 and @xmath157 was taken as evidence that chain order parameter also has nodes in the gap .",
    "however , in our present data , additional superfluid response clearly turns on _ below _ @xmath70 and if this is due to chains , then this would imply that chain superconductivity occurs at a lower temperature than the planes and would also directly contradict the conclusions reached in ref.@xcite .",
    "recent experiments on anisotropic thermal conductivity in detwinned @xmath40 single crystals have also revealed enhanced superfluid density below @xmath158 which has been interpreted as due to chains @xcite .",
    "this will be consistent with our observations of the microwave response in @xmath15 .",
    "we turn our attention now to the transition region close to @xmath12 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the penetration depth @xmath159 is expected to reveal the characteristic nature of the superconducting gap as it opens up and also possible contributions due to fluctuations .",
    "in contrast to conventional superconductors , the low dimensionality and small coherence length in cuprates make them good candidates for studying the effect of superconducting fluctuations and in determining the universality class they belong to .",
    "while ginzburg - landau theory generally describes the region near the transition very well in conventional superconductors , it has been argued that in @xmath4 assuming the simplest case of a _ single _ complex order parameter , it is possible to observe critical behavior which would give rise to fluctuations corresponding to the universality class of the three dimensional ( 3d ) @xmath160 model .",
    "transport and thermodynamic measurements in the presence of a magnetic field have been interpreted in terms of this model @xcite .",
    "however , this has also been disputed by roulin et al .",
    "@xcite  who argue that fits of the specific heat near @xmath161 in ybco single crystals for high magnetic fields do not weigh in favor of 3d @xmath160 scaling .",

    "specifically , a plot of [ @xmath162@xmath163as a function of @xmath6 just below @xmath46 is a useful indicator of the validity of standard mean - field or the 3d @xmath160 models . while a mean - field behavior can be deduced if [ @xmath164@xmath165 is linear in @xmath6 , 3d @xmath160 would require [ @xmath166@xmath167 to be linear in @xmath6 .",
    "the latter behavior has been observed in penetration depth measurements by the ubc group @xcite and has been interpreted as consistent with the critical behavior of the 3d @xmath160 model .",
    "it is important to note the the choice of the range of temperature over which one looks for effects due to fluctuations is crucial .",
    "the dynamical fluctuations in the frequency dependent microwave conductivity above @xmath46 has been examined by booth et al .",
    "they arrive at the conclusion that while the gaussian fluctuations can account for the behavior over a larger range in temperature , just @xmath168 above @xmath46 , the behavior is dominated by critical fluctuations .",
    "it should be noted that the temperature dependence of [ @xmath166@xmath165 from kinetic inductance measurements has shown mean - field dependence @xcite .    in a bid to investigate the transition region in our data on @xmath15 and @xmath35 single crystals ,",

    "except the data for ae180 which has a slightly higher slope ( @xmath173 ) , the other data form a set of parallel lines .",
    "this behavior is consistent with mean - field variation of the order parameter below @xmath46 . to illustrate the point further ,",
    "a plot of [ @xmath174@xmath165 vs @xmath6 is presented in the bottom panel of fig.[meanfield1 ] for one @xmath2 crystal .",

    "the inset shows the same data plotted as [ @xmath174@xmath167 vs @xmath6 which is non - linear and rules out the possibility of 3d @xmath160 .",
    "the smooth variation of the [ @xmath175@xmath167 vs @xmath6 curve also indicates against the possibility of interpretation as a crossover behavior from 3d @xmath160 very near @xmath46 to a mean - field like variation at lower temperatures .",
    "our conclusion in this context would be that the near-@xmath46 behavior in all @xmath4 crystals is governed by standard mean - field expression .",
    "it is interesting to note that this universal behavior may also be indicative of a scenario against the possibility of a single order parameter .",
    "absence of 3d @xmath160 correlations is not surprising if one considers unconventional pairing states with mixed symmetry .      assuming a local @xmath176 relation in the skin depth limit , the normal state surface resistance can be written as @xmath177 where the microwave normal state resistivity is expected to be the same as the dc resistivity and @xmath178 here @xmath71 is the london penetration depth and @xmath179 is the normal state scattering rate .",

    "the ratio @xmath192 of the peaks are much higher and can not be explained due to coherence effects predicted by bcs theory .",

    "it is important to note that _ the two temperature scales of _",
    "@xmath197 _  and _ @xmath11 _  are present in _ @xmath40 _  also_. this can be seen from the fact that two component analysis also describes the @xmath40 data , as shown in fig.[yszfit ] , provided a suppressed @xmath140 and @xmath198 are used .",
    "this suggests that in the @xmath40 crystals , impurities lead to suppression of the pairing density of the a component , as well as greatly enhanced scattering of the b component .",
    "a very sharp peak in @xmath88 just below @xmath12 at around @xmath199 is seen in all ( @xmath15 as well as @xmath40 ) samples , so that there are a total of @xmath200 conductivity peaks .",

    "we have considered this issue very carefully and several experiments show that this is _ conclusively _ ruled out . in - situ",
    "resisitivity meaasurements at high temperatures have shown that the crystals can be reversibly oxygenated - deoxygenated , and that the diffusion constants are well characterized , indicating nothing unusual about the oxygenation of these samples @xcite .",
    "note also that the @xmath40 sample @xmath202 was oxygenated using the same procedures but did not display the new features in the conductivity .",

    "@xcite on thin films suggest mean - field behavior , in agreement with the conclusions of this paper .",

    "@xmath206 , the symmetry is predominantly of type @xmath26 , although a small @xmath134component is also induced due to the coupling . at lower temperatures @xmath207 , the @xmath134component grows so that both components ( and hence a mixed symmetry ) are present .",
    "microscopic calcuations of thermodynamic properties of superconducting lattice fermions which also have multiple pairing channels also show that the thermodynamic signatures , such as specific heat cusps , are weaker in the subdominant channels which appear at lower temperatures than in the main channel @xcite . + while we have presented a simple phenomenological two - component model in this paper to account for the two conductivity peaks in @xmath15 , microscopic calculations ( similar to those based on a single @xmath24wave order parameter @xcite ) need to be done for the surface impedance of a two - component superconductor .",

    "mixed order parameter symmetry and multi - component behavior of the order parameter has been addressed in several theoretical papers which can be broadly classified along the following categories :    ( 1 ) _  _ @xmath208 it has been argued that the orthorhombic structure of @xmath4 naturally leads to a mixing of @xmath108 and @xmath109 order parameter components @xcite .",
    "several theories @xcite advocate to this general concept of a mixed @xmath209 op and have successfully developed models which can describe the experimental results in @xmath210 this appears to be consistent with photoemission data on overdoped @xmath188 also @xcite .",
