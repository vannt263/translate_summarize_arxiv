    "one of the most basic operations of linear optics is the interference between two optical modes in a two - path interferometer . in quantum optics",
    ", this scenario has been widely studied in the context of quantum metrology , where it serves to illustrate the role of non - classical correlations in the phase sensitivity of multi - photon interference @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these arguments about phase sensitivity often leave out the details of the physics , focusing merely on the perceived figures of merit and not on the mechanisms by which multi - photon interference patterns emerge .",
    "recent experiments on multi - photon interference are providing a much more detailed picture of non - classical effects in two - mode interferences @xcite , and it might be time to ask what these experimental observation of multi - photon fringes can tell us about the nature and origin of quantum interference .    to properly address this question ,",
    "it is necessary to distinguish carefully between classical wave interference and quantum interference . in typical experiments ,",
    "multi - photon fringes are detected by measuring the phase dependence of count rates for a fixed combination of input and output conditions .",
    "quantum interference thus appears as a modulation in the phase dependence of a single multi - photon probability .",
    "this is quite different from classical interference , where the output intensity is a deterministic function of the phase shift and probabilities appear only as a technical noise background . in quantum optics , classical interference",
    "is usually associated with the poissonian photon counting statistics of coherent states , which describes a highly localized increase of detection probability for the classically expected intensity distribution at a specific phase shift in the interferometer . in the limit of high photon number",
    ", we can distinguish classical interference and multi - photon quantum interference qualitatively , since only the latter effect is associated with multiple interference fringes in the phase dependence of the output probabilities , and these interference fringes have distinct periodicities that are much shorter than @xmath0 .",
    "it is therefore a non - trivial challenge to explain the relation between the modulations of probability seen in multi - photon interference and the statistics of classical interference effects observed in the phase dependence of output intensities .    in the present paper ,",
    "we address this problem by examining the role of the operators representing the coherence of the two field modes .",
    "these operators have a clear classical meaning , describing the intensity differences between any two modes as a component of a three dimensional vector in close analogy to the algebra of quantized spins .",
    "we point out that the phase dependence of the quantum state components representing a specific measurement outcome can be described in terms of weak values of the intensity difference between the two arms of the interferometer .",
    "these weak values can be written as a function of the eigenvalues of the initial and the final state using relations that correspond to the classical causality of two - path interference .",
    "for the case of photon number states in both the input and the output , we can then derive a differential equation describing the phase dependence of a single interference fringe , where the main contribution to the phase dependence originates from the rapid oscillation of the fringes , while the slowly varying envelope describes the statistics expected for a classical interference of two fields when the optical phases of the input fields are completely random .",
    "it is possible to identify the periodicity of the multi - photon fringes that describe the quantum mechanical modulation of output probability with the intensity difference between the paths obtained from the weak value of the squared operator representing this intensity difference .",
    "the periodicity of multi - photon interference fringes can thus be explained in terms of a classical estimate of the intensity difference between the paths obtained from the experimentally controlled input and output conditions .",
    "our results show that multi - photon interference can be understood in terms of the classical relations between the intensities and coherences of the two modes .",
    "specifically , the quantum mechanical phase of the multi - photon interference fringes is given by a classical action that relates the optical phase shift to its generator , the intensity difference between the paths .",
    "the non - classical effects of multi - photon interference can thus be traced to the fundamental role of the action in quantum physics @xcite .",
    "it may be worth noting that the direct identification of the action of phase shifts also provides a more efficient approach to the quantization of fields that starts from the macroscopically observable physics and hence avoids many of the ambiguities associated with the mathematical concepts of superpositions and state vectors .",
    "multi - photon interference may thus help us bridge the gap between quantum mechanical concepts and classical intuition in a new and unexpected manner .",

    "sec : wv ] , it is shown that weak values can be used to express the phase dependence of a single multi - photon interference fringe .",
    "based on this observation , we derive a differential equation for the interference fringes obtained with well - defined photon numbers in the input and the output . in sec . [",
    "sec : separate ] , the differential equation derived in sec . [ sec : wv ] is solved approximately by separating the interference fringe into an interference term described by a phase dependent action @xmath1 and an envelope function @xmath2 .",

    "[ sec : examples ]",
    "we apply the theory to a number of characteristic cases , comparing the approximate results to exact results obtained for eight and sixteen photons .",
    "the results show that the approximation correctly describes the main features of multi - photon interference , especially with regard to the separation of quantum interference effects and classical random phase field interference . in sec .",

    "[ sec : noon ] we discuss the relation between the general analysis of multi - photon interference using the action and the definition of multi - photon interference based on superpositions of photon number eigenstates in the interferometer paths associated with the well known noon states .",

    "[ sec : concl ] summarizes the results and concludes the paper .",
    "the physics of two optical modes can be described in terms of the field operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 that describe the complex field amplitudes of the two modes . due to their mathematical effects on photon number states ,",
    "these field operators are commonly known as annihilation operators , although it should be kept in mind that this mathematical effect is not related to the physical properties described by the operators in any obvious or intuitive manner .",
    "the proper connection between two mode coherences and photon number is obtained by considering the second order products of field amplitudes , @xmath5 each component of this three dimensional vector represents an intensity difference between two orthogonal modes in units of @xmath6 per photon . the motivation for this choice of units is the representation of phase shifts between the modes @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which is generated by the component @xmath7 in the same way that a hamiltonian generates the time evolution .",
    "specifically , the unitary transformation of a phase shift is given by @xmath8 and the effect of a phase shift on an arbitrary state @xmath9 can be described by @xmath10 here , the product @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : unitary ] ) represents the action of a phase shift , just as the action of a time evolution is given by the energy - time product @xmath12 .    in a two path interferometer",
    ", @xmath7 describes the intensity difference between the two paths in the interferometer .",
    "the intensity difference between the input modes is usually given by @xmath13 .",
    "the remaining component @xmath14 describes the phase coherence between the input fields that results in interferences when a phase shift of @xmath15 is applied . for a phase shift of @xmath15 ,",
    "the intensity difference observed in the output can be given by @xmath16 in the following , we will consider input states @xmath17 that are eigenstates of the input intensity difference @xmath13 , and measurements of the output intensity difference @xmath18 .",
    "specific measurement results can be given by an integer or half - integer value of @xmath19 representing one half of the photon number difference between the output ports .",
    "since the total photon number @xmath20 is conserved , @xmath19 represents a photon number state of the two output ports with output photon numbers of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the quantum states @xmath23 representing these measurement results are eigenstates of @xmath18 with eigenvalues of @xmath24 .",
    "we are therefore interested in the phase dependent values of the output probabilities given by @xmath25 where the unitary transformation is used to relate the state @xmath26 to the input state @xmath27 .",
    "experimentally , these probabilities are obtained as multi - photon coincidence rates for the detection of @xmath22 photons in one output port and @xmath21 photons in the other .",
    "quantum interference is observed as a phase dependent modulation of the probability , with a periodicity that can be as short as @xmath28 for @xmath20 photons .",
    "we will now analyze the phase dependence of @xmath29 to identify the origin of these quantum interference fringes in multi - photon interference .",
    "we can apply the transformation of quantum states given by eq.([eq : schroed ] ) to describe the phase evolution of the probability amplitudes @xmath29 associated with specific measurement outcomes @xmath19 . in its most conventional form ,",
    "the resulting differential equation is given by @xmath30 in the textbook approach to quantum dynamics , the operator @xmath7 is usually expanded into its matrix representation in the measurement basis @xmath23 . however , this may not be the most meaningful analysis of the role of the generator @xmath7 in the evolution of the input - output relation @xmath31 . a closer correspondence to classical dynamics can be maintained by identifying the contribution of @xmath7 with its weak value , @xmath32 it is interesting to note that the weak value can be used to express the effects of the operator @xmath7 on the phase evolution of the state component @xmath33 .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that it is often possible to find the weak value without having to solve the complete dynamics in the schrdinger picture .",
    "specifically , weak values can be determined by expressing the operator as a function of two operators , where the initial state is an eigenstate of the first and the final state is an eigenstate of the second operator .    in the present case",
    ", @xmath17 is an eigenstate of @xmath13 and @xmath34 is an eigenstate of @xmath18 , which can be related to the operators at @xmath35 using eq.([eq : heis ] ) . since the algebra of the @xmath36 operators is the familiar algebra of spin operators for a total spin quantum number of @xmath37 , it is possible to derive a relation between the phase shift generator @xmath7 and the components @xmath13 and @xmath18 in the @xmath13-@xmath14 plane orthogonal to @xmath7 by using the total length of the @xmath38-vector , @xmath39 since the initial and the final state are eigenstates of @xmath38-vector components orthogonal to @xmath7 , it is not possible to distinguish negative values of @xmath7 from positive values of @xmath7 . as a result of this symmetry ,",
    "the real part of the weak value of @xmath7 is zero at all phases @xmath15 , and the ratio between the amplitude @xmath29 and its phase derivative in eq.([eq : action ] ) is always real .",
    "it is therefore possible to express @xmath29 by real numbers for all values of @xmath15 .    to make optimal use of the relation in eq.([eq : jquad ] ) , we now consider the second derivative of the phase dependence , @xmath40 this derivative is described by the weak value of @xmath41 , and this weak value can be determined using the eigenvalues @xmath42 and @xmath19 for the input state and the measurement outcome , respectively .",
    "it is important to arrange the order of the operators so that the operator @xmath13 is always to the right of the operator @xmath18 , and the necessary application of the commutation relations results in a contribution from the imaginary weak value of @xmath7 .",
    "the final relation between the weak values and the eigenvalues therefore reads @xmath43 since both the weak value of @xmath41 and the weak value of @xmath7 appear in the phase derivatives of @xmath33 , we can use this relation between the weak values and the eigenvalues to find a differential equation for the phase dependence of the probability amplitude @xmath33 that does not depend on the probability amplitudes of any other measurement outcomes @xmath19 .",
    "according to eqs.([eq : action ] ) and ( [ eq : quadact ] ) , this differential equation can be written as @xmath44 we have thus derived a general mathematical description of the multi - photon interference fringes observed with any photon number input . in the following , we will consider the physics described by this differential equation and identify the characteristic features of its solutions .",
    "the description of the effects of phase shifts on multi - photon states given by eq.([eq : fringes ] ) makes it possible to separate quantum effects from the classical limit by considering how the relation changes with total photon number .",
    "classical effects should all scale with the total intensity , whereas the magnitude of quantum effects will always depend on absolute photon numbers . in the present case",
    ", such a separation of scales can be achieved by expressing the probability amplitudes @xmath33 by a product of a slowly varying envelope function @xmath45 and a quantum interference effect given by an action @xmath46 that describes the rapid modulation of probability associated with multi - photon interference , @xmath47 the factor of two represents the interference between two classical solutions , as will be seen more clearly in the following discussion .",
    "note that there is no approximation involved at this point , and the separation in eq.([eq : separate ] ) can be used to obtain an exact solution of eq.([eq : fringes ] ) for a specific photon number . however , our main concern is the comparison between the quantum effects that are expressed by the rapid oscillation of @xmath48 and the much slower variation of @xmath45 that corresponds more closely to the classical statistics of random phase interference . in the following ,",
    "we will therefore focus on approximate solutions , where the different scales of the phase dependence allow a complete separation between the dynamics of @xmath46 and the dynamics of @xmath45 .",
    "specifically , the use of @xmath49 in eq.([eq : separate ] ) allows us to expand eq.([eq : fringes ] ) in @xmath49 , where the classical limit emerges when action differences of @xmath49 are not resolved . in the limit of sufficiently large photon numbers ,",
    "we can therefore identify quantum effects as effects that depend on the precise ratio between the macroscopic action @xmath46 and the fundamental constant @xmath49 .    in eq.([eq :",
    "fringes ] ) , the derivatives result in contributions that depend explicitly on the fundamental constant @xmath49 . due to the smallness of @xmath49",
    ", we can expand the equation and neglect higher order contributions of @xmath49 in favor of the lower order contributions .",

    "is given by @xmath54 where the choice of sign is arbitrary since the action @xmath1 is defined by the phase of a cosine in eq.([eq : separate ] ) .",
    "we choose the negative sign because it corresponds to the conventional definition of action in classical hamilton - jacobi theory , as will be seen below .",
    "importantly , the right hand side of this equation has a very intuitive physical meaning : it is the classical value of @xmath7 obtained from the length of the @xmath38-vector and the values of @xmath13 and @xmath18 when the heisenberg relation between the operators in eq.([eq : heis ] ) is converted to a classical relation between the eigenvalues by neglecting the non - commutativity of @xmath18 and @xmath13 .",
    "we can define this classical approximation of @xmath55 as @xmath56 which describes the intensity difference between the arms of a classical two - path interferometer when an input intensity difference of @xmath57 and a phase shift of @xmath15 result in an output intensity difference of @xmath24 .",
    "the approximate quantum mechanical solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq : fringes ] ) given by eq.([eq : sapprox ] ) then corresponds to the classical relation between the generator @xmath55 and the action @xmath1 given by a version of the hamilton - jacobi equation , @xmath58 the reason why this action describes a quantum effect is that it appears as the quantum phase of the multi - photon interference fringes described by eq.([eq : separate ] ) , where the classical action @xmath1 is converted into a quantum phase by dividing it by @xmath49 .",
    "thus , the larger the classical action @xmath1 becomes , the faster the output probability oscillates , resulting in microscopic ( and therefore highly phase sensitive ) modulations of probability in the limit of macroscopic action .",
    "the approximations used above apply whenever the modulation dominates the phase dependence , which is the case whenever @xmath55 is sufficiently larger than @xmath49 .",
    "we can now turn to the approximate solution for the slowly varying envelope function @xmath45 .",
    "since the quantum effects are for the most part described by the interference effects associated with the action in eq.([eq : separate ] ) , we expect the square of the envelope function @xmath45 to represent the classical probability density of the multi - photon interference scenario .",
    "specifically , the phase dependence of @xmath45 can be determined by considering the second largest term in the expansion of eq.([eq : fringes ] ) in @xmath49 , which is proportional to @xmath52 .",
    "the result can be written as @xmath59 the general solution of this equation does not depend on the specific value of @xmath55 and can be expressed by a relation between @xmath45 and @xmath46 given in more compact form as @xmath60 since the phase derivative of the action is given by ( [ eq : hje ] ) , it is possible to express the squared envelope function @xmath61 as a function of @xmath55 and a normalization factor of @xmath62 , @xmath63 this relation corresponds to a classical density of output intensities , where the factor of @xmath49 originates from the quantized distance between two eigenvalues of @xmath13 .",
    "once the factor of @xmath49 is removed , the probability density scales with total intensity , indicating that the envelope function @xmath2 represents statistics that are also observable in the classical limit .",
    "it is in fact possible to derive an expression for @xmath62 based on classical considerations .",
    "if we assume that the probability distribution originates from random phase interference between the two input intensities , we can explain the probability densities in terms of the phase difference @xmath64 between the input modes .",
    "since the output value of @xmath18 is a deterministic function of the fixed input value of @xmath13 and the random phase @xmath64 , the ratio of probability densities for intervals of @xmath65 and intervals of @xmath66 is given by @xmath67 thus the factor in the denominator of eq.([eq : ergo ] ) effectively converts probability densities in the random phase @xmath64 into probability densities in the output observable @xmath68 .",
    "for homogeneous phase distributions , the factor of @xmath62 in eq.([eq : ergo ] ) is given by @xmath69 using these relations , it is possible to find a properly normalized solution for the envelope function @xmath45 .",
    "in the light of this result , we can conclude that the slowly varying envelope function describes the classical statistics originating from the random optical phase of the photon number states in the input .",
    "specifically , the phase dependence of @xmath61 given by eq.([eq : ergo ] ) is independent of the absolute photon number if the photon number differences of @xmath70 and @xmath71 are given by constant fractions of total photon number . in the limit of high @xmath20",
    ", this means that the shape of the envelope @xmath45 does not change much if the photon number changes by about @xmath72 , corresponding to the poissonian photon number fluctuations of coherent states .",
    "it is therefore also possible to observe @xmath45 using random phase interferences between two coherent states of light , where the relative error in @xmath73 caused by photon number fluctuations drops to zero with @xmath74 . on the other hand ,",
    "the multi - photon interference patterns described by @xmath46 disappear in the statistics of coherent states because their periodicities are much shorter than the absolute shot noise value of @xmath72 in the limit of high photon number . we can therefore confirm that @xmath45 is classical in the sense that it can also be observed using input states that can be represented by mixtures of coherent states as described by a positive p - function , while the multi - photon fringes described by @xmath46 are non - classical since they disappear when the input can be described as a mixture of coherent states .    in combination with the solution for the action @xmath1 , we now have an approximate solution for @xmath33 that is valid whenever the values of @xmath55 are sufficiently large . for multi - photon states , this condition is usually satisfied if there is a classical solution that relates the input intensity to the output intensity for a phase shift of @xmath15 .",
    "the condition only breaks down when the argument in the square root of eq.([eq : j3 ] ) is very small or negative .",
    "note that eq.([eq : fringes ] ) can also be solved in the regime of negative @xmath75 values , where the differential equation describes evanescent solutions characterized by an exponential suppression of the amplitude @xmath33 with increasing distance from the region of positive @xmath75 .",
    "mathematically , this situation is equivalent to the evanescent wavefunctions known from tunneling .",
    "in fact , a comparison of eq.([eq : fringes ] ) with the time independent schrdinger equation shows that the mathematics are quite similar , and that the method of approximation used above corresponds to the wkb - approximation in the region where the energy is larger than the potential energy .",
    "the regions where @xmath55 drops to zero and becomes imaginary can therefore be treated in close analogy to the wkb approximation for the tunneling problem , by allowing evanescent solutions where the cosine function in eq.([eq : separate ] ) is replaced by a corresponding exponential function .",
    "the intermediate regime close to @xmath76 corresponds to the turning points of the wkb solution and can be approximated by airy functions . in this manner , it is possible to obtain an approximate solution of eq.([eq : fringes ] ) at all photon numbers .",
    "however , we are mostly concerned with the multi - photon interference fringes observed for @xmath77 , so a detailed analysis of the evanescent parts of the phase dependence is not necessary in the present context .",
    "the main merit of the present analysis is that it allows us to separate the quantum interference effects described by the action @xmath1 from the effects of classical field statistics originating from the randomness of the optical phases in the input , which are represented by the envelope function @xmath2 . in the following",
    ", we will apply this analysis to several representative examples of multi - photon interference fringes in order to illustrate how the approximations used here reproduce the characteristic features of multi - photon interference for different input - output relations .",
    "in the measurement scenarios we are considering , the input photon number distribution and the output photon number distribution are both fixed , and the phase dependence of the probability for this specific combination is investigated . for a given total photon number @xmath20 , different measurement scenarios are defined by the combination of input photon number difference @xmath71 and output photon number difference @xmath78 . to illustrate our method of analysis ,",
    "it is best to start with a particularly simple class of scenarios , where the photon numbers in both input and output ports are equal , so that @xmath79 . in this case",
    ", we find that the intensity difference between the two arms of the interferometer does not depend on phase and is simply given by the total length of the @xmath38-vector ,",
    "latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : hb }    in terms of classical wave interference , it is easy to understand why equal intensities in both the input and the output require a maximal intensity difference between the paths . since both @xmath13 and @xmath18 are zero , we can immediately conclude that @xmath14 should also be zero , so that the @xmath38-vector must point in the direction of @xmath7 .",
    "it is also possible to argue that we do not observe any interferences between the two paths , and this is only possible when all of the light travels along only one of the two paths . as mentioned above",
    ", @xmath55 is actually derived from the weak value of @xmath41 , so the choice of sign in eqs.([eq : j3 ] ) and ( [ eq : hje ] ) is merely an arbitrary convention . in terms of the actual physics",
    ", the scenario is complete symmetric in the two paths , so it is impossible to distinguish positive and negative values of @xmath55 .",
    "the quantum interferences described by @xmath48 in eq.([eq : separate ] ) are a consequence of this path symmetry @xcite . according to eq.([eq : hje ] ) , the distance @xmath81 between two minima of the interference fringes ( @xmath82 ) is given by @xmath83 it is worth noting that the value of @xmath84 is larger than the maximal eigenvalue of @xmath7 , resulting in fringes that have a shorter period than fringes observed for superpositions of @xmath85 and @xmath86 , the states known as noon states @xcite .",
    "the observation of shorter fringes is somewhat surprising because firstly , the noon states achieve the maximal possible phase sensitivity of @xmath20-photon states and secondly the fringes of photon number states can be written as a sum of fringes from superpositions of @xmath87 and @xmath88 , where the noon state contribution is the contribution with the shortest fringe periodicity .",
    "however , the weak value of @xmath41 is not limited by the available range of eigenvalues , resulting in a fringe periodicity that corresponds to an additional one photon intensity difference between the paths .",
    "specifically , the classical relation between @xmath55 and the eigenvalues @xmath57 and @xmath24 does not include any uncertainties , and the total length of the @xmath38-vector is given by @xmath89 because the `` @xmath90 '' contribution represents the necessary quantum fluctuations of an eigenstate with maximal @xmath7 eigenvalue .",
    "the shorter fringes therefore represent the absence of quantum noise in the deterministic relation between input photon numbers and output photon numbers .",
    "importantly , the shorter fringes are only obtained for this specific combination of input and output , which means that this effect is compensated by measurement results with less phase sensitivity and does not result in an enhanced overall phase sensitivity @xcite .",

    "this is a result of the symmetry between negative and positive intensity differences between the paths . if there is only a single classical solution for @xmath55 , the action given by eq.([eq : hje ] ) will merely describe an unobservable phase evolution of @xmath93 . in this sense",
    ", one can explain quantum interference as an interference between the two classical solutions @xmath183 and @xmath184 , both of which connect @xmath182 to @xmath19 under phase shifts of @xmath15 .",
    "importantly , this interference can be described without any reference to hilbert space vectors , since the physical properties @xmath185 can all be defined within classical wave theory .",
    "it may therefore be useful to take a closer look at the relation between classical wave interference and the quantum interference of multi - photon states .",
    "as shown above , multi - photon interference can be understood in terms of the weak values of the generator @xmath7 that describes the phase shift induced by a two - path interferometer . to explain the connection with more conventional ideas of quantum interference as an effect of superpositions in the initial state",
    ", it may be useful to consider a particularly simple solution of eq.([eq : act2 ] ) , where the periodicity of the interference fringes is determined by the input state and does not depend on output photon number or phase .",
    "this situation only occurs if the input state is an eigenstate of @xmath41 , so that the weak value is given by the initial eigenvalue and does not depend on phase anymore . except for arbitrary phase shifts , the complete set of states with constant fringe periodicity",
    "is therefore given by @xmath186 where @xmath177 are the @xmath7 eigenstates with eigenvalues of @xmath176 .",
    "similar to the case of equal photon numbers in input and output , the derivative of the action is constant and a multiple of @xmath49 , @xmath187 for an @xmath20-photon state , the maximal number of fringes is obtained for the so - called noon state , where @xmath85 .",
    "it is therefore tempting to think of multi - photon interference as an @xmath20-fold increase in the number of fringes , or an @xmath20-fold enhancement of phase sensitivity .",

    "in general , the weak value of @xmath41 provides an estimate of the intensity distribution between the paths for a specific combination of input state , measurement outcome , and phase shift .",
    "this estimate identifies the proper physics of multi - photon interference .",
    "what is perhaps most remarkable about the results presented above is that the quantum effects of multi - photon interference can be explained by using the deterministic relations between field coherences already known from classical two - path interference .",
    "the classical interference effect is actually described by the operator relation in eq.([eq : heis ] ) , where the output intensities are expressed as a function of input intensities , coherence , and phase shift . in classical theory ,",
    "probabilities enter the picture only if there is some randomness in the initial conditions . in the case of photon number inputs discussed above",
    ", this randomness can be identified as a random phase difference between the two input fields .",
    "as the approximation shows , the quantum mechanical result reproduces this classical probability distribution over random phases in the form of the envelope function that describes the amplitude of the quantum interference fringes .",
    "importantly , quantum interference is not an effect that emerges gradually from classical field interference as photon number increases , but should be considered as a fundamentally different effect associated with the non - classical relation between the phase shift @xmath15 and its generator @xmath7 .",
    "the only reason why this effect is related to photon number is that , as a quantum effect , its scale is determined by @xmath49 .",
    "all classical effects scale with intensity , only the quantum interference fringes decrease in width as photon number increases .",
    "the analysis in this paper shows that it is possible to separate the quantum scale and the classical scale in the quantum theory of multi - photon interference fringes , highlighting the different physics involved in the two distinct processes .",
    "in conclusion , multi - photon interferences can be explained in terms of the weak values of the intensity difference between the paths of the interferometer . for photon number states ,",
    "it is then possible to describe each multi - photon interference fringe by its own differential equation .",
    "the approximate solution of this differential equation identifies the periodicity of the fringes with the intensity difference between the paths inside the interferometer , which can be determined from the classical relation between input intensity difference , output intensity difference , and phase .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to separate the quantum effects of multi - photon interference from the classical statistics of random phase interference .",
    "specifically , we can trace quantum interference back to the action of the phase shift , which is given by the product of the generator @xmath7 and the phase shift @xmath15 .",
    "the photon number appears in this relation only because @xmath7 is quantized in units of @xmath49 .",
    "the classical units of intensity difference are action units , where @xmath49 is the ratio between the action and the quantum phase .",
    "our analysis thus shows that an detailed analysis of multi - photon interference can be achieved by focusing on the classical field properties if both the input state and the measurement outcomes are treated on an equal footing .",
