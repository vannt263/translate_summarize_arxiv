    "quantum nonlocality , responsible for violation of bell - type inequalities @xcite , and entanglement ( inseparability ) are the fundamental resources of modern quantum - information theory and still the most surprising features of quantum mechanics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore desirable to investigate the degrees of the bell - inequality violation and of the entanglement of a quantum state not only in relation to efficiency of quantum - information processing , but also to understand better subtle aspects of the physical nature .",
    "it is well - known that pure states @xcite or a mixture of two bell states violate bell inequalities whenever they are entangled .",
    "so , one could naively think that the only mixed states that do not violate the bell inequalities are separable states .",
    "however , werner @xcite demonstrated the existence of entangled states which do not violate any bell - type inequality .",
    "the standard two - qubit werner state is defined by @xcite @xmath0 being a mixture for @xmath1 of the singlet state @xmath2 and the separable maximally mixed state , given by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the identity operator of a single qubit . definition ( [ n01 ] ) is often generalized to include mixtures of any maximally entangled state ( mes ) instead of the singlet state only .",
    "so , e.g. , one can analyze the werner - like state defined by @xcite @xmath5 as a convex combination of the bell state @xmath6 ) , contrary to ( [ n02 ] ) , is invariant if both qubits are subjected to same unitary transformation , say @xmath7 .",
    "nevertheless , for a given @xmath8 , both states ( [ n01 ] ) and ( [ n02 ] ) exhibit the same entanglement properties , thus ( [ n02 ] ) is also referred to as the werner state @xcite .",
    "in addition to the fact that the werner states can be entangled without violating any bell inequality for some values of parameter @xmath8 , they can still be used for quantum - information processing including teleportation @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the werner states , given by ( [ n01 ] ) and ( [ n02 ] ) , can be considered maximally entangled mixed states of two qubits @xcite in the sense that their degree of entanglement can not be increased by any unitary operations , and they have the maximum degree of entanglement for a given linear entropy ( and vice versa ) .",
    "we will study the effects of a lossy environment , modelled by thermal reservoirs , on the bell - inequality violation and on the entanglement of the initial werner and werner - like states in the quest for new states including those having different orderings induced by two entanglement measures : concurrence @xmath9 and negativity @xmath10 ( defined in sect .",
    "the relativity of the entanglement measures was first observed by eisert and plenio @xcite .",
    "they showed numerically , using monte carlo simulation , that the condition @xmath11 can be violated by some two - qubit mixed states , although it is satisfied if @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the werner states or pure states .",
    "virmani and plenio @xcite demonstrated that all good asymptotic entanglement measures are either identical or impose different orderings of quantum states .",
    "the problem of relativity of the entanglement measures was also studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . here , in particular , we present analytical examples of different orderings imposed by the concurrence and negativity for two - qubit states , which violate the bell inequality to the same degree .",
    "the letter is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "ii , we discuss a dissipative model and give a general solution for two decaying qubits initially in the werner states . a comparative study of the bell - inequality violation and entanglement of various decaying states are given is sects .",
    "iii and iv , respectively .",
    "a final comparison and conclusions are given in sect .",
    "we analyze evolution of two initially correlated qubits subjected to dissipation modelled by their coupling to thermal reservoirs ( phonon baths ) as described by the following hamiltonian @xmath14   \\label{n04}\\ ] ] which is the sum of hamiltonians for the system , @xmath15 , reservoirs and the coupling between them , respectively .",
    "it is a prototype model , where qubits can be implemented in various ways , e.g. , by single - cavity modes restricted in the hilbert space spanned by the two lowest fock states ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in ( [ n04 ] ) , @xmath16 is the annihilation operator for the @xmath17th ( @xmath18 ) qubit at the frequency @xmath19 ; @xmath20 is the annihilation operator for the @xmath21th oscillator in the @xmath17th reservoir at the frequency @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are the coupling constants of the reservoir oscillators .",
    "we assume no direct interaction between the qubits , thus the system hamiltonian is simply given by @xmath24 . the standard master equation for the model reads as @xmath25+\\sum_{k=1}^{2}\\frac{\\gamma _ { k}}{2}\\{\\bar{n}_{k}(2{a}_{k}^{\\dag } { \\rho } { a } _ { k}-{a}_{k}{a}_{k}^{\\dag } { \\rho } -{\\rho } { a}_{k}{a}_{k}^{\\dag } )   \\notag \\\\ & & + ( \\bar{n}_{k}+1)(2{a}_{k}{\\rho } { a}_{k}^{\\dag } -{a}_{k}^{\\dag } { a}_{k } { \\rho } -{\\rho } { a}_{k}^{\\dag } { a}_{k})\\ }   \\label{n05}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the reduced density operator for the qubits",
    ", @xmath27 is the damping constant and @xmath28 is the mean number of thermal photons of the @xmath17th reservoir . the exact solution of ( [ n05 ] ) for arbitrary initial conditions and arbitrary - dimensional systems is well known .",
    "by confining our analysis to the initial qubit states coupled to the quiet reservoirs ( @xmath29 ) , the solution in the computational basis @xmath30 in the interaction picture can compactly be given as @xmath31    \\label{n06}\\ ] ] where the elements of the initial density matrix @xmath32 are denoted by @xmath33 ; @xmath34 and @xmath35 ,   \\notag \\\\ h_{k } & = & g_{3-k}[(1-g_{k})\\rho _ { 33}+\\rho _ { kk } ) ] ,   \\notag \\\\ { h } & = & 1-(h_{1}+h_{2}+g_{1}g_{2}\\rho _ { 33 } ) .",
    "\\label{n07}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we will apply solution ( [ n06 ] ) to analyze the effect of dissipation on the bell - inequality violation and entanglement of the initial werner states .",
    "we will study violation of the bell inequality due to clauser , horne , shimony and holt ( chsh ) @xcite . in a special case of two qubits in an arbitrary mixed state @xmath36",
    ", one can apply an effective criterion for violating the bell inequality : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the bell operator given by @xmath39 with its mean value maximized over unit vectors @xmath40 in @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , @xmath42 is the vector of the pauli spin matrices @xmath43 , and scalar product @xmath44 stands for @xmath45 . by noting that any @xmath36 can be represented in the hilbert - schmidt basis as @xmath46 where @xmath47 are vectors in @xmath41 , horodecki et al .",
    "@xcite proved that the maximum possible average value of the bell operator in the state @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 in terms of @xmath50 , where @xmath51 @xmath52 are the eigenvalues of the real symmetric matrix @xmath53 ; @xmath54 is the real matrix formed by the coefficients @xmath55 , and @xmath56 is the transposition of @xmath54 .",
    "thus , the necessary and sufficient condition for violation of inequality ( [ n08 ] ) by the density matrix ( [ n10 ] ) and bell operator ( [ n09 ] ) for some choice of @xmath57 reads as @xmath58 @xcite . to quantify the degree of the bell - inequality violation one can use @xmath59 , @xmath60 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , or @xmath61 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "but we propose to use the following quantity @xmath62 which has a useful property that for any two - qubit pure state it is equal to the entanglement measures such as concurrence and negativity , defined in the next section . as @xmath63",
    ", it holds @xmath64 , where @xmath65 corresponds to the maximal violation of inequality ( [ n08 ] ) and @xmath66 for states admitting the local hidden variable model .",
    "the larger value of @xmath67 the greater violation of the bell inequality .",
    "thus , @xmath68 can be used to quantify the degree of the bell - inequality violation ( biv ) , and for short it will be referred to as the _ biv degree_.    the biv degrees for the initial werner states @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the same and equal to @xmath71 implying that the states violate the bell inequality iff @xmath72 . by changing",
    "the parameter @xmath8 into @xmath73 , ( [ n13 ] ) goes into another well - known form ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "although the third eigenvalue differs from that for @xmath92 the biv degrees @xmath95 and @xmath96 decay in the same manner : @xmath97 as shown , e.g. , by solid curves in figs .",
    "2(a , b ) and 4 .",
    "obviously , by changing the sign in the definitions of the bell states @xmath98 and @xmath99 , one finds the same decay of the biv degree .",
    "thus , one could conjuncture that all mess decay in the same way .",
    "we will show that this is not true by analyzing the following initial state @xmath100 where @xmath101 .",
    "state @xmath102 is another mes , which has the biv degree ( and also the concurrence and negativity ) equal to one , and can be obtained from @xmath98 by applying locally the hadamard transformation to the second qubit .",

    "for this and other reasons concerning the entanglement properties ( see sect .",
    "iv ) being the same as for the state ( [ n01 ] ) , we shall simply refer to ( [ n19 ] ) as the werner state despite the fact that ( [ n19 ] ) is not @xmath7 invariant .",

    ". however , by assuming that only one of the qubits is coupled to the reservoir , say @xmath122 and @xmath88 , the biv degree of @xmath123 decreases at the same rate as that of @xmath124 and @xmath125 and all the three the biv degrees are given by @xmath126 which is a special case of ( [ n17 ] ) and ( [ n21 ] ) .",
    "clearly for @xmath127 , ( [ n23 ] ) goes over into ( [ n22 ] ) as expected .",
    "the decays of the biv degrees for one of the damping constants equal to zero are presented graphically by solid curves in fig .",

    "the negativity is another measure of bipartite entanglement being related to the peres - horodecki criterion @xcite and defined by @xcite @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the density matrix of two subsystems ( say , @xmath144 and @xmath145 with @xmath146 and @xmath147 levels , respectively ) , and the sum is taken over the negative eigenvalues @xmath148 of the partial transpose @xmath149 of @xmath26 with respect to one of subsystems ( say @xmath144 ) in the basis @xmath150 : @xmath151 for two - qubit ( @xmath152 ) states , the sum in ( [ n29 ] ) can be skipped as @xmath149 has at most one negative eigenvalue @xcite .",
    "the negativity , especially in low - dimensional systems ( @xmath153 and @xmath154 ) , is a useful measure of entanglement satisfying the standard conditions @xcite .",
