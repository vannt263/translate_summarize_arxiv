    "the quantum hall effect , discovered in 1980 by klaus von klitzing,@xcite allows one to determine the quantum resistance standard in terms of the electron charge and plank s constant with a spectacular accuracy .",
    "however , the level of precision necessary for metrology applications ( a few parts per billion ) requires for conventional quasi - two - dimensional semiconductor systems the use of ultra - low temperatures and high magnetic fields.@xcite the discovery of graphene@xcite in 2004 led to a revival of interest in quantum hall effect physics.@xcite the energy of landau levels ( lls ) in graphene is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the fermi velocity , @xmath2 is the magnetic length , @xmath3 is the magnitude of the applied magnetic field , @xmath4 is the ll number , and the `` @xmath5 '' signs correspond to the electrons and holes respectively .",
    "@xcite for @xmath6 the separation between the zero and the first ll in graphene is @xmath7 ( in comparison , @xmath8 in conventional quasi - two - dimensional semiconductor systems ) . therefore , the quantum hall effect in graphene can be observed even at room temperatures in experimentally attainable magnetic fields .",
    "indeed , the room - temperature quantum hall effect in graphene was first observed in 2007;@xcite however , extremely high magnetic fields ( up to @xmath9 ) were needed .",
    "it has been understood since the 1930 s that the longitudinal conductivity of metals in a quantizing magnetic field increases with increasing electron scattering.@xcite to develop a graphene - based quantum hall standard of resistance,@xcite which would work at elevated temperatures and in moderate magnetic fields , it is essential to examine the contributions from different scattering processes to the longitudinal conductivity @xmath10 in the quantum hall regime ( qhr ) , @xmath11 , as @xmath10 provides the major correction to the quantized value of the hall resistance . in conventional semiconductor systems",
    "the quantum hall effect is observed at liquid helium temperatures only , and the value of @xmath10 is governed by scattering on disorder . in the qhr , @xmath10 depends exponentially on the energy separation between the fermi level and the nearest ll .",
    "the longitudinal conductivity prefactor has a theoretically - predicted value of @xmath12 in the presence of short - range disorder and @xmath13 in the presence of long - range disorder.@xcite it was shown that the contribution from phonon scattering is negligibly small .",
    "the exceptions are exotic cases such as magnetoroton dissociation , in which the whole effect arises from scattering on phonons,@xcite or an enhancement of phonon - induced scattering near the intersection of two lls corresponding to different size - quantization subbands.@xcite however , as we show in this paper , the phonon - scattering mechanism dominates in the high - temperature qhr in graphene , since at @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 is the sound velocity in graphene @xcite ) the energy of an acoustic phonon with a wavevector comparable to the inverse magnetic length is much smaller than the temperature ; therefore , the number of such phonons increases drastically .    in this paper",
    "we restrict our consideration to electron scattering induced by the interaction with intrinsic in - plane phonons only , neglecting the effects of disorder as well as electron - electron interactions .",
    "our calculations result in the lower estimate of the longitudinal conductivity @xmath10 in graphene in the qhr , as we do not study electron interactions with various other types of phonons such as out - of - plane flexural phonons , which are present in suspended samples,@xcite or bulk acoustic phonons in a substrate , which interact with electrons in graphene on polar substrates such as boron nitride @xcite or silicon carbide via piezoelectric coupling.@xcite",
    "the wave function of a charged carrier ( electron or hole ) in graphene subjected to a magnetic field @xmath16 normal to the graphene plane is given in the landau gauge , @xmath17 , by the following expression:@xcite @xmath18 \\left[{h_{n}\\left [ \\left(x - x_{0}\\right ) / l_{b } \\right ] \\atop \\pm \\sqrt{2 n } h_{n-1 } \\left [ \\left(x - x_{0}\\right ) / l_{b } \\right]}\\right ] \\frac { \\exp \\left(ik_{y } y\\right ) } { \\sqrt{l_{y } } } \\mbox{,}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the guiding centre coordinate , @xmath22 is the electron wavevector @xmath23-component , @xmath24 are the hermite polynomials , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the graphene sample dimensions , the `` @xmath5 '' sign corresponds to electrons and holes , and the spin and valley indeces are omitted . here",
    "the @xmath27-axis has been chosen in the direction of the applied magnetic field and the @xmath28-axis and @xmath23-axis are in the graphene plane . the wave function given by eq.([2componentwf ] )",
    "is defined for one dirac point only and its two components correspond to graphene s two sublattices . in what follows all results will be obtained for electrons only .",
    "calculations for the non - equivalent dirac point and holes can be easily repeated in a similar fashion . from here on we will omit the `` @xmath5 '' sign in order to simplify notation .",
    "we account for the valley and spin degeneracy by multiplying the final result for @xmath10 by the factor of four at the final stage of calculations .",
    "electron scattering on phonons leads to a change in the @xmath22 component of the electron wavevector , which results in a change to the electron guiding centre coordinate @xmath29 .",
    "electron transitions between lls due to one phonon scattering are suppressed due to the large energy gaps between lls in graphene in the qhr .",
    "indeed , the number of phonons with the energy required for such transitions is @xmath30 ( @xmath31 is the energy gap between two different lls in graphene ) , which is very small in the qhr .",
    "inter - ll scattering on acoustic phonons has an additional exponentially strong suppression in the matrix element of transition which is markedly different from the case of conventional semiconductor systems as discussed in the appendix .",
    "it is also evident that in the qhr only scattering on acoustic phonons can provide a noticeable contribution to the longitudinal conductivity @xmath10 .",
    "the optical phonon energy in graphene corresponds to the temperature range @xmath32  @xcite which leads to very small optical phonon occupation numbers at room temperatures and below . in this work ,",
    "we are interested in phonon - induced equilibrium longitudinal conductivity , whereas , magneto - phonon resonance associated with optical phonons has been studied in ref .",
    "one - phonon scattering within the same ll is ineffective because of the small width of the lls , which can be arguably achieved in pristine graphene samples .",
    "interestingly , even in heavily disordered samples the broadening of lls was found to shrink in several particular cases .",
    "@xcite for our calculations we assume an infinitely narrow band of delocalized states in the middle of each ll with a vanishing density of states in between lls . in this limit one - phonon scattering within one ll is forbidden by energy and momentum conservation . the next order process to consider is two - phonon scattering through virtual states with no change in the electron initial and final ll numbers but with the change in its in - plane momentum ( or the guiding centre coordinate ) .",
    "we calculate the longitudinal conductivity @xmath10 at the @xmath4th ll due to two - phonon scattering using the generalized form of the einstein relation:@xcite @xmath33    @xmath34    where @xmath35 + 1 \\right \\ } ^{-1}$ ] is the ll filling factor , @xmath36 is the ll energy defined by eq.([landaulevels ] ) , @xmath37 is the fermi energy , @xmath22 and @xmath38 are the @xmath23-components of the electron wavevector before and after scattering , @xmath39 is the diffusion coefficient , and @xmath40 is the probability of scattering .",
    "two - phonon scattering in graphene in the qhr is possible through two different virtual intermediate states : a phonon with wavevector @xmath41 is first emitted or a phonon with wavevector @xmath42 is first absorbed .",
    "transitions changing the electron ll number in the intermediate states are strongly suppressed due to small values of corresponding matrix elements and the presence of large denominators in the expression for @xmath40 ( see appendix ) .",
    "therefore , in what follows we consider only transitions with no change in the electron ll number .",
    "then , the probability of two - phonon scattering is given by fermi s golden rule with the matrix element @xmath43 where @xmath44 ^{-1}$ ] is the phonon occupation number , @xmath45 is the acoustic phonon frequency , and @xmath46 is the electron - phonon coupling operator .",
    "operators describing electron scattering on intrinsic longitudinal ( la ) and transverse ( ta ) acoustic phonons in graphene are @xcite @xmath47    @xmath48    where @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the graphene 2d mass density , @xmath51 is the position vector in the graphene plane , and @xmath52 is the angle between the phonon wavevector @xmath53 and the @xmath28-axis . the diagonal matrix elements in eqs.([efinteractionla])-([efinteractionta ] ) describe electron coupling to the phonon - created deformation potential , and the off - diagonal matrix elements originate from the phonon - induced bond - length modulations , which effect hopping amplitudes between two neighbouring sites .",
    "the corresponding coupling constants were estimated as @xmath54 and @xmath55.@xcite note that the deformation potential couples electrons with la phonons only .",
