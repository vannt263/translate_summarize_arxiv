    "the bogoliubov theory of weakly interacting bose gases @xcite provides an essential tool to investigate the effect of interactions in bosonic systems @xcite and it plays a key role in the study of properties of bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "its results for the ground - state energy and condensate depletion are in agreement in the weakly interacting limit with the findings obtained by other methods subsequently developed , including rigorous treatments @xcite .",
    "an important point is that also when it does not ( quantitatively ) work , it is useful to have results which are of guide for a qualitative understanding , as in the case of helium@xmath4 @xcite , or to have estimates of the ground - state energy , as in the case of the @xmath5 lieb - liniger model for small couplings @xcite .",
    "moreover , being a self - consistent approach , where the number of condensate particles has to be self - consistently determined , it gives information on the issue whether there is condensation or not , as in low - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "finally , the bogoliubov transformation used to diagonalize the quadratic hamiltonian obtained by the bogoliubov approximation is used in a variety of other systems , including spin - wave theory of antiferromagnets @xcite and superconductors @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the generalization of the bogoliubov theory to local and non - local / finite - range @xmath2-body and general multi - body interactions .",
    "our reasons for such an investigation are the following :    * on one side , we are motivated by recent experiments in which matter wave breathers were observed using an attractively interacting bose - einstein condensate @xcite . from a comparison between experimental findings and gross - pitaevskii results ,",
    "it was concluded that @xmath2-body interactions may play an important role and an estimate of ( the real part of ) @xmath6 was provided @xcite . *",
    "the effect of @xmath2-body interaction terms in dipolar systems is very interesting as well , as it was recently investigated in @xcite for a harmonically trapped dilute dipolar condensate with a short - range @xmath2-body interaction .",
    "it was shown that this system exhibits a condensate state and a droplet state , discussing how the droplet crystal may be an excited state arising from heating as the system crosses the phase transition . *",
    "a tool to study ultracold strongly interacting systems such as @xmath5 bose gas @xcite or unitary fermi gases @xcite is to introduce effective local interactions .",
    "recent examples are provided by the recent study of the monopole excitations for the @xmath5 bose gas @xcite using an effective gross - pitaevskii equation of the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the external potential , @xmath9 is the density and the non - linear term @xmath10 is extracted from the solution of the bethe ansatz integral equations for the ( homogeneous ) @xmath5 bose gas @xcite .",
    "another example is the study of small - amplitude josephson oscillations of a @xmath11 unitary fermi gas in a double well potential @xcite , where experimental data were compared with an equation of the form with @xmath12 the pair density , @xmath8 the double well one - body potential and @xmath10 extracted from monte carlo numerical results @xcite ( an example of a possible parametrization of @xmath10 across the bec - bcs crossover is in @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear that in the weakly interacting limit it is @xmath13 : this corresponds for the @xmath5 bose gas to the limit @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the lieb - liniger coupling constant @xcite , and for fermions in the bec - bcs crossover to the bec limit @xmath16 , @xmath17 being the scattering length . when deviations from the weakly interacting limit are incorporated through an @xmath18 which is no longer proportional to @xmath12 , if the function @xmath18 admits a series expansion of the form @xmath19 , then there are effective multi - body local interactions ( corresponding to integer values @xmath20 )",
    ". therefore , to treat such multi - body ( albeit effective ) interaction terms one needs to study in the bogoliubov theory such higher - body terms , as we do systematically below . * finally ,",
    "when ( local or non - local / finite - range ) 2-body terms are present jointly with higher - body contributions ( as @xmath2-body ones ) , they may compete to make the system stable or unstable and it is of interest to determine stability conditions and the spectrum of the quasi - particles .",
    "a typical example is given by an attractively interacting bose gas , having @xmath21 , which can be made stable by a repulsive @xmath2-body term - another example is the dipolar gas in presence of a @xmath2-body term . in the following we derive within the bogoliubov theory the stability conditions in presence of general multi - body local interactions ( considering the case of non - local @xmath2-body interactions as well ) ,",
    "then we discuss in detail some specific examples .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section ( [ sec : local ] ) we consider general multi - body contact interactions for a homogeneous weakly interacting gas treated in the bogoliubov approximation .",
    "we consider first the case of an @xmath0-body @xmath1-interaction and successively we consider a local interaction which can be expanded in series of general @xmath0-body terms . for this class of interactions",
    "we compute the spectrum , the stability condition and the ground - state energy ( also for the @xmath5 case ) . we finally present results for contact interactions that can not be expanded in series . in section ( [ sec : finite - range ] ) we discuss the case of non - local interactions : after briefly reviewing the well - known case of a @xmath3-body non - local interaction , we study two different cases of @xmath2-body non - local interactions , and a comparison between these two cases is performed with a gaussian pair - wise interaction .",
    "the results of sections ( [ sec : local ] ) and ( [ sec : finite - range ] ) are used in section ( [ sec:2_3 ] ) to the case of a model with @xmath3- and @xmath2-body contact interactions and the obtained findings are applied to the experimental setup described in @xcite . in section ( [ sec : other ] ) we discuss some further realistic interaction potentials of interest for current experimental setups with ultracold atoms .",
    "we present results for a @xmath3-body non - local potential plus @xmath3- and @xmath2-body @xmath1-interactions , with applications on dipolar systems , e.g. magnetic atoms and polar molecules , and soft - core potentials , that can be simulated with rydberg dressed atoms , to discuss the effect of a @xmath2-body interaction term .",
    "finally we present our conclusions in section ( [ sec : concl ] ) , while more technical material is presented in the appendices .",
    "in this section we consider general local @xmath1-interparticle potentials with multi - body interactions .",
    "we start by considering a model for a gas of @xmath22 bosonic particles interacting only via local repulsive @xmath0-body @xmath1-interactions .",
    "the general hamiltonian for @xmath0-body interactions reads @xmath23 where the bosonic field operators satisfy the canonical commutation relations @xmath24",
    "= 0 = \\left [ \\hat{\\psi}^{\\dagger}({\\mathbf{r } } ) ,   \\hat{\\psi}^{\\dagger}({\\mathbf{r ' } } ) \\right]$ ] and @xmath25   = \\delta({\\mathbf{r } } - { \\mathbf { r'}})$ ] .",
    "we assume @xmath0-body local contact interactions having the form : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a coefficient of dimension @xmath28=[e]\\cdot[l]^{3n-3}$ ] . in the usual case of 2-body @xmath1-interaction one",
    "has @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the mass of the bosons @xcite . with potential",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath31    using for the field operator the expansion @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the volume of the system ( chosen to be a cube of side @xmath34 with periodic boundary conditions ) and @xmath35 , with @xmath36 , the hamiltonian assumes the form @xmath37 with @xmath38 given as usual by @xmath39 where @xmath40 , and the interaction part reading as @xmath41 with the definition @xmath42    now , proceeding as usual , we make the bogoliubov prescription @xcite @xmath43 as usual this implies that @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the condensate number , or the largest eigenvalue of the one - body density matrix @xcite .",
    "we then proceed by neglecting in @xmath46 products of 3 or more @xmath47 with @xmath48 .",
    "to start with , we consider @xmath2-body interactions , that is , @xmath49 . from it",
    "follows the total momentum conservation .",
    "therefore , one has to arrange @xmath3 nonzero momenta between @xmath2 initial and @xmath2 final possible momenta . to enumerate all the possibilities , we may start by considering all the momenta of the creation operators equal to zero :    l*4cr @xmath50 & @xmath51 & @xmath52 & @xmath53 & @xmath54 & @xmath55 + 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & @xmath56 & @xmath57 + & & & @xmath56 & 0 & @xmath57 + & & & @xmath56 & @xmath57 & 0 +    i.e. the contribution to @xmath46 is @xmath58 multiplied by @xmath2 , that is the combinatorial multiplicity , @xmath59 , as illustrated in the table above . for a generic @xmath0 , it is therefore straightforward to conclude that the coefficient @xmath60 has to be replaced by @xmath61 .",
    "going ahead , the next possible dispositions are    l*4cr @xmath50 & @xmath51 & @xmath52 & @xmath53 & @xmath54 & @xmath55 + @xmath56 & 0 & 0 & @xmath56 & 0 & 0 + & & & 0 & @xmath56 & 0 + & & & 0 & 0 & @xmath56 + 0 & @xmath56 & 0 & @xmath56 & 0 & 0 + & & & 0 & @xmath56 & 0 + & & & 0 & 0 & @xmath56 + 0 & 0 & @xmath56 & @xmath56 & 0 & 0 + & & & 0 & @xmath56 & 0 + & & & 0 & 0 & @xmath56 +    from which one can infer that the corresponding contribution to @xmath46 is @xmath62 with multiplicity @xmath63 . for a general @xmath0",
    "the multiplicity is @xmath64 .    finally , the remaining possibilities are when all the momenta of the annihilation operators are vanishing :    l*4cr @xmath50 & @xmath51 & @xmath52 & @xmath53 & @xmath54 & @xmath55 + @xmath56 & @xmath57 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 + @xmath56 & 0 & @xmath57 & & & + 0 & @xmath56 & @xmath57 & & & +    whose contribution to the operatorial part is @xmath65 with multiplicity 3 , as in the first case considered above ; hence , for a general @xmath0 , the multiplicity is @xmath61 .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian in the bogoliubov approximation for a general @xmath0 reads @xmath66 defining the density @xmath67 and the condensate fraction @xmath68 , one gets @xmath69 \\hat{a}_{{\\mathbf{p}}}^{\\dagger } \\hat{a}_{{\\mathbf{p } } } + u_n n_0^{n-1 } \\frac{n(n-1)}{2 n ! }    \\sum_{{\\mathbf{p } } \\neq 0 } \\biggl [ \\hat{a}_{{\\mathbf{p}}}^{\\dagger } \\hat{a}_{-{\\mathbf{p}}}^{\\dagger } + \\hat{a}_{{\\mathbf{p } } } \\hat{a}_{-{\\mathbf{p } } } \\biggr ] \\mbox{. } \\label{eqn:2_bogol_4}\\ ] ] introducing the total particle number operator @xmath70 and enforcing the total number conservation ( or , in other terms , subtracting the chemical potential @xcite ) , one finally obtains @xmath71 we can rewrite @xmath72 as @xmath73 where the sum on @xmath74 indicates that it has to be taken over one half of momentum space , and @xmath75    the next step is to perform the bogoliubov transformation @xmath76 where @xmath77 ( general formulas for the coefficients @xmath78 and @xmath79 are given in the next subsection ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath80 where the following quantity has been introduced : @xmath81 so that the quasi - particle spectrum is given by @xmath82 of course , for interactions involving only @xmath0-body @xmath1-interactions the stability depends just on the sign of @xmath83 : if @xmath83 is positive ( negative ) , the argument in the square root of is positive for all @xmath56 ( negative for small @xmath56 ) , and the system is stable ( unstable ) .",
    "when more interactions are present , then one has to impose for stability a suitable combination of the parameters @xmath27 to be positive , as discussed in the next subsection .",
    "we consider in this subsection a model where there is a sum of @xmath3-body , @xmath2-body, ... ,@xmath0-body @xmath1-interactions ( where @xmath0 is arbitrary ) . in order to generalize the formulas presented in section ( [ sec : n - body_only ] ) , we consider @xmath22 bosons interacting via contact repulsive interactions described by the hamiltonian @xmath84 where the @xmath85-th parameter @xmath86 has physical dimension @xmath87 \\ ! \\cdot \\ !
