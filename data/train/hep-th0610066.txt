    "non  perturbative methods in quantum field theory ( qft ) play a central rle in theoretical physics , with applications in many areas , from string theory to condensed matter . during the last two decades ,",
    "considerable progress has been registered in the study of two  dimensional systems , where exact results have been obtained in the particular situations of conformally invariant or integrable models ( for detailed accounts of these achievements , see for instance refs.@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a natural continuation of the above mentioned studies consists in developing some techniques to control analytically two  dimensional qft which do not display conformal invariance or integrability and therefore are presently analyzed by perturbative or numerical methods only .",
    "this review summarizes the contributions of the author in this respect , obtained in collaboration with giuseppe mussardo and galen sotkov .",
    "our main tool was an appropriate generalization and extension of semiclassical methods , which proved to be efficient in analysing non - perturbative effects in qft since their introduction in the seminal works of refs.@xcite .",
    "the semiclassical approach does not require integrability , therefore it can be applied on a large class of systems . at the same time , it permits to face problems which are not fully understood even in the integrable cases , such as the analytic study of qft in finite volume .",
    "in particular , it has led to new non  perturbative results on form factors at a finite volume@xcite , spectra of non ",
    "integrable models@xcite and energy levels of qft on finite geometries@xcite .",
    "further achievements in understanding advantages and drawbacks of the semiclassical method have been presented by g. mussardo in ref.@xcite .",
    "the semiclassical method is best suited to deal with those quantum field theories characterized by a non ",
    "linear interaction potential with different degenerate minima .",
    "these systems display kink excitations , associated to static classical backgrounds which interpolate between neighbouring minima , which generally have a large mass in the small coupling regime . under these circumstances , although the results obtained are based on a small coupling assumption , they are nevertheless non - perturbative , since the kink backgrounds around which the semiclassical expansion is performed are non - perturbative too .",
    "the restriction on the variety of examinable theories imposed by the above requirements is rather mild , since non  linearity is the main feature of a wealth of relevant physical problems .",
    "the review is organized as follows . after recalling the basic aspects of semiclassical quantization in section[sectsemicl ] , in section[sectnonint ]",
    "we discuss its application to the study of the spectrum in non ",
    "integrable qft .",
    "section[sectfinitesize ] presents the analysis of finite  size effects , and we conclude in section[conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we will describe the two main tools used in the following to investigate non ",
    "integrable spectra and finite  size effects .",
    "the first is represented by the semiclassical quantization technique , introduced for relativistic field theories in a series of papers by dashen , hasslacher and neveu ( dhn)@xcite by using an appropriate generalization of the wkb approximation in quantum mechanics .",
    "the second is a result due to goldstone and jackiw@xcite , which relates the form factors of the basic field between kink states to the fourier transform of the classical solution describing the kink . for a complete review of these beautiful achievements , and complementary techniques developed by other groups during the seventies ,",
    "see ref.@xcite .",
    "although semiclassical methods are naturally formulated for qft in any dimension @xmath0 , here we will only consider ( 1 + 1)dimensional theories , in virtue of their simplified kinematics that allows for powerful applications of the semiclassical techniques .",
    "the semiclassical quantization of a field theory defined by a lagrangian @xmath1 is based on the identification of a classical background @xmath2 which satisfies the euler  lagrange equation of motion @xmath3 the procedure is particularly simple and interesting if one considers finite  energy static classical solutions @xmath4 in 1 + 1 dimensions , usually called kinks `` or solitons '' .",
    "they appear in field theories defined by a non ",
    "linear interaction @xmath5 displaying discrete degenerate minima @xmath6 , which are constant solutions of the equation of motion and are called vacua \" .",
    "the ( anti)kinks interpolate between two next neighbouring minima of the potential , and they carry topological charges @xmath7 .    being static solutions of the equation of motion , i.e. time independent in their rest frame , the kinks can be simply obtained by integrating the first order differential equation related to ( [ eom ] ) @xmath8 further imposing that @xmath4 reaches two different minima of the potential at @xmath9 .",
    "these boundary conditions , which describe the infinite volume case , require the vanishing of the integration constant @xmath10 .",
    "as we will see in the following , the kink solutions in a finite volume correspond instead to a non",
    " zero value of @xmath10 , related to the size of the system .    for definiteness in the illustration of the method",
    ", we will focus on the example of the @xmath11 theory in the broken @xmath12 symmetry phase , defined by the potential @xmath13 this theory displays two degenerate minima at @xmath14 , and a static ( anti)kink interpolating between them @xmath15 the corresponding classical energy , obtained by integrating the energy density @xmath16 , @xmath17 diverges as the interaction coupling @xmath18 , indicating that the solution is non  perturbative .",
    "fig.[figphi4 ] shows the potential , the classical kink and its energy density .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     from the theoretical point of view , this model is an ideal laboratory where to compare results obtained by ffpt around the integrable sine ",
    "gordon model@xcite ( for small @xmath19 ) and semiclassical methods@xcite ( for small @xmath20 ) . depending on",
    "the value of the phase @xmath21 , the potential ( [ vdsg ] ) displays different qualitative features , which can be grouped in two classes : @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we will now briefly summarize the results obtained in ref.@xcite , to which we refer the reader for details .",
    "let us first describe the @xmath22 case , by focusing on the particular value @xmath24 ( the qualitative features are the same for all other values ) . as shown in fig.[figsg ] , as soon as a @xmath25 in switched on in the potential , the degeneracy between neighbouring vacua of the sine  gordon model is spoiled , with a consequent confinement of the solitons . at the same time , a new static kink appears , which interpolates between the vacua at @xmath26 and @xmath27 in fig.[figsg ] .",
    "the semiclassical method can be applied to this excitation to determine the corresponding neutral bound states .",
    "complementarily , ffpt is capable of estimating the corrections to the masses of sine  gordon breathers which , being non  topological excitations , are not confined as the corresponding solitons . therefore , the two techniques combine together in the analysis of the full spectrum of the model .",
    "a qualitatively different scenario appears at the value @xmath23 . in this case , the degeneracy of two neighbouring minima of the sine ",
    "gordon model is not destroyed , hence the solitons are not confined but simply deformed into a `` large kink '' and a `` small kink '' which interpolate between the minima separated by a larger or smaller wall , respectively ( see fig.[figsg ] ) . in this case , a straightforward application of the semiclassical method leads to wrong results .",
    "it seems that there are two towers of neutral states with different masses around each vacuum , one obtained as bound states of long kink and long antikink , and the other from short kink and short antikink .",
    "this is in contradiction with the fact that the breathers of the unperturbed sine  gordon model are non degenerate , and it is moreover disproved by numerical analysis@xcite .",
    "the controversy has been clarified in ref.@xcite , by noticing that , at leading order in the coupling in which the semiclassical form factor ( [ ffinf ] ) is computed , the short and long kink are invisible to each other , while the correct spectrum of neutral states must be the result of the interaction between the two different kinks .",
    "an exact formula for the masses of neutral states is still unknown , yet the semiclassical method provides useful information for the limiting cases when the masses of long and short kink are very close , or when the large kink is much heavier than the small ( see ref.@xcite for details ) .    the problem outlined above is typical of every potential where kinks of different masses originate from the same vacuum .",
    "therefore , particular care has to be adopted in applying the semiclassical method to those cases . for further comments and developments ,",
    "see the discussion in ref.@xcite .",
    "quantum field theory on a finite size is a subject of both theoretical and practical interest . besides providing a way to control the extrapolation procedure of numerical simulations , the study of a theory in finite volume also permits to follow the renormalization group flow between the ultraviolet ( uv ) conformal limit and the infrared ( ir ) massive behaviour .",
    "clearly understood in cft ( see ref.@xcite ) , finite  size effects can be tackled non  perturbatively in integrable qft as well , with the so  called thermodynamic bethe ansatz method@xcite , which is a combination of analytical and numerical procedures .    in this section",
    ", we will discuss the contributes to this subject obtained through the semiclassical method@xcite .",
    "once the proper classical solutions are identified to describe a given geometry , the spectral function in finite volume can be easily estimated by adapting the goldstone and jackiw s result .",
    "furthermore , the finite  volume kinks can be quantized semiclassically via the dhn technique , which permits to write in analytic form the discrete energy levels as functions of the size of the system .",
    "we will now explicitly show the construction in the case of the sine ",
    "gordon model , defined by the potential ( [ vsg ] ) @xmath28 we chose this integrable theory as the guiding example in this section , since the analysis of its finite size effects is technically simpler than in the @xmath29 theory .",
    "full details about the @xmath29 model can be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "being an integrable theory , the sine ",
    "gordon model has been already studied on a finite size by appropriate extensions of the thermodynamic bethe ansatz@xcite . in comparison with those techniques",
    ", the semiclassical method provides more explicit anlytical results .",
    "it would be interesting to perform a quantitative comparison between the two approaches , in order to directly control the range of validity of the semiclassical approximation , as it was done in the infinite volume case .",
    "the basic ingredient in the semiclassical study of finite size effects is the classical kink solution on a finite volume .",
    "this can be obtained by solving eq.([firstorder ] ) with an appropriate constant @xmath10 to encode the chosen boundary conditions .",
    "we will now focus on a cylindrical geometry of circumference @xmath30 , where the b.c . for",
    "a single kink can be quasi  periodic or antiperiodic : @xmath31 and correspond to @xmath32 and @xmath33 in eq.([firstorder ] ) , respectively .",
    "the associated classical solutions are expressed in terms of elliptic functions , whose modulus @xmath34 is related to the size @xmath30 : @xmath35\\;,\\quad & k^2=\\frac{\\frac{m^2}{\\beta^{2}}a+2}{2}\\;,\\quad r=\\frac{2}{m}\\,\\textbf{k}(k^2)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( see fig.[figsgsol ] ) .",
    "p8cmp8 cm    &    for simplicity , we will now only discuss the quasi ",
    "periodic case @xmath36 , which is characterized by a classical energy @xmath37\\;.\\ ] ] a complete treatment of the antiperiodic background @xmath38 can be found in ref.@xcite , while the study of other backgrounds related to a strip geometry with dirichlet boundary conditions has been performed in ref.@xcite .",
    "we will first show that the relation between classical solutions and semiclassical form factors presented in section[secsemff ] also holds in finite volume .",
    "this comes from the possibility of choosing @xmath39 as a solution of eq.([firstorder ] ) with any constant @xmath10 , which is related to the size of the system .",
    "we have now to consider the matrix elements of @xmath40 between two eigenstates @xmath41 and @xmath42 of the finite volume hamiltonian @xmath43 .",
    "these states can be naturally labelled with the so - called `` quasi - momentum '' variable @xmath44 , which corresponds to the eigenvalues of the translation operator on the cylinder ( multiples of @xmath45 ) , and appears in the space dependent part of eq.([heis ] ) in the case of finite volume , the quasi - momentum is related to the free momentum @xmath46 of the infinite volume asymptotic states by the so  called bethe ansatz equation @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is a phase shift which encodes the information about the interaction . ] .",
    "defining @xmath49 as the `` quasi - rapidity '' of the kink states by @xmath50 we can now write the form factor at a finite volume by replacing the fourier integral transform with a fourier series expansion : @xmath51 where @xmath52 this result , of very general applicability , adds to previous studies of finite volume form factors@xcite , which on the contrary deeply rely on the integrable structure of the considered models . in our particular example , the fourier transform of ( [ sgkinkfinvol ] ) gives @xmath53+\\right.\\\\ & & \\hspace{0.8cm}+\\left.i\\,\\frac{1}{\\,\\theta_{n}\\,\\cosh\\left(k\\,\\textbf{k}'\\frac{m}{m}\\ , \\theta_{n}\\right)}\\right\\}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the kink mass @xmath54 can be approximated at leading order with its classical energy ( [ classen ] ) .",
    "we will now briefly sketch the semiclassical derivation of energy levels in finite volume ( for a detailed discussion see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the aim is to obtain analytical expressions for the energies @xmath55 as functions of the circumference @xmath30 .",
    "the procedure consists in adapting the dhn quantization , outlined in sect.[sectsemicl ] , to the finite geometry .",
    "we already know the explicit expression of the classical kink ( [ sgkinkfinvol ] ) satisfying quasi  periodic boundary conditions . in order to construct the scaling functions",
    ", we have to solve the corresponding schrdinger equation ( [ stability ] ) and to derive an analytical expression for its frequencies @xmath56 . here",
    "we will not discuss the mathematical details of this procedure , which is explained in ref.@xcite ; in essence , the stability equation turns out to be of the so  called @xmath57 lam type , for which exact solutions are known in terms of elliptic and weierstrass functions .",
    "the final result for the frequencies is @xmath58\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is defined by @xmath60 which has the physical meaning of momentum quantization ( see ref.@xcite for definitions of the weierstrass functions @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) . by inverting the relation between @xmath30 and @xmath34 in ( [ sgkinkfinvol ] ) ,",
    "it is easy to plot the frequencies ( [ omegan ] ) ( see fig.[figomegai ] ) , which represent the energies of the excited states ( [ tower ] ) with respect to the ground state ( [ e0 ] ) .    in order to derive the ground state energy in the kink sector ,",
    "it is necessary to regularize the infinite sum ( [ e0 ] ) , by subtracting to it the ground state energy in the vacuum sector and an appropriate mass counterterm .",
    "the procedure can be explicitly carried out in the ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) regimes , when @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "it is particularly interesting to compare the corresponding limiting behaviours with asymptotic results already known for the sine  gordon theory .",
    "the small @xmath65 expansion is @xmath66 + \\ldots\\;,\\ ] ] and it has to be compared with the conformal field theory prediction@xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the central charge , @xmath69 is the lowest scaling dimension in the sector under consideration , and @xmath70 is the so  called bulk coefficient . for the sine  gordon model the bulk energy term is given by@xcite @xmath71 hence the corresponding term in ( [ grstatefinalexp ] ) has the correct small@xmath20 behaviour .",
    "moreover , the scaling dimension of the kink  creating operator is known to be@xcite @xmath72 again in agreement with ( [ grstatefinalexp ] ) does not appear in ( [ grstatefinalexp ] ) , since it cancels out in the subtraction of the ground state energy in the vacuum sector ] .",
    "we should now look at the ir limit of the kink energy , and compare it with the asymptotic approach to the infinite volume kink mass predicted by lscher s theory@xcite : @xmath73 at leading order in @xmath20 , this behaviour can be already detected at the level of the classical energy ( [ classen ] ) , whose ir expansion is @xmath74 where the kink mass in infinite volume is @xmath75 .",
    "the successful check with known uv and ir asymptotic behaviours confirms the ability of the semiclassical method to analytically describe the scaling functions of sg model in the one  kink sector .",
    "we have briefly reviewed some fruitful applications of semiclassical methods to the study of non  integrable qft and finite  size effects in two dimensions .    in order to keep the discussion reasonably short ,",
    "we have omitted to mention some interesting phenomena which can be captured by the semiclassical method , like unstable resonance states and false vacuum decay .",
    "details can be found in the original literature .",
    "let us mention two of the several open problems which deserve further attention .",
    "first , the study of semiclassical form factors at higher order in the coupling constant would lead not only to quantitatively better results , but also to a satisfactory understanding of the spectrum in models where two different kinks emerge from the same vacuum , as we discussed in the double sine  gordon case .",
    "second , a systematic investigation of the finite  size spectrum beyond the one  kink sector is still missing .",
    "this requires to find appropriate time ",
    "dependent classical solutions on a finite size and apply to them the semiclassical quantization procedure .",
