    "photons have long been considered as one of the most powerful probes to characterize the initial state of the system produced in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "this is complementary to the @xmath2 spectra of bulk hadrons which reflect the late conditions close to freeze - out .",
    "the thermal emission of photons shows a strong temperature dependence , high @xmath2 photons are mostly emitted from the hot and dense early stage of the system evolution when the hydrodynamic flow is weak , whereas low @xmath2 photons are emitted from the flow boosted relatively cold later part of the system .",
    "recent studies have shown that event - by - event qcd - matter density fluctuations in the initial conditions ( ic ) are needed ( in addition to a correct reference plane definition ) for reproducing the measured charged - particle elliptic flow even for most central collisions , which was underestimated by all earlier hydrodynamic calculations using smooth ic  @xcite .",
    "we show that fluctuations in the initial state enhance the production of thermal photons significantly for @xmath3 gev/@xmath1 compared to a smooth ic .",
    "this makes the thermal photons in that @xmath2 range especially suitable to probe the hotspots in the ic  @xcite .",
    "we use the event - by - event hydrodynamical model developed in  @xcite to calculate the production of thermal photons from fluctuating as well as from smooth ic . a monte carlo glauber model with the standard two - parameter woods - saxon nuclear density profile",
    "is used to create the initial state nucleon configurations , and to compute the number of wounded nucleons .",
    "the initial density profile is taken to be proportional to the number of wounded nucleons ( wn ) , where entropy density @xmath4 is distributed in the @xmath5 plane around the wounded nucleons using a 2d gaussian smearing , @xmath6 here @xmath7 is a fixed overall normalization constant and @xmath8 is a free parameter which determines the size of the fluctuations .",
    "the initial formation time of the plasma is taken as @xmath9 0.17 fm/@xmath1 , motivated by the ekrt minijet saturation model  @xcite .",
    "we choose a default value for the size parameter as @xmath10 0.4 fm  @xcite .",
    "the equation of state which shows a sharp cross - over transition from the plasma phase to the hadronic phase is from  @xcite .",
    "the temperature at freeze - out is taken as 160 mev ( see  @xcite and  @xcite for more details ) . this model has been applied successfully to reproduce both the measured centrality dependence as well as the @xmath2 dependence of charged particle elliptic flow up to @xmath11 gev/@xmath1 , and the pion @xmath2 spectra up to @xmath12  gev/@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "we use the complete leading order rates @xmath13 of  @xcite for the emission from plasma and the parametrization given in  @xcite for the hadronic matter emission which at present can be considered as the state of the art for photon production .",
    "the switching from the plasma rates to hadronic rates is done at a temperature 170 mev . the total thermal emission from the produced qcd matter",
    "is obtained by integrating the emission rates over the space - time history of the fireball as @xmath14 with @xmath15 as the local temperature and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the four - momentum of the photon and @xmath18 is the local four - velocity of the flow field .",
    "values of ( a ) 1 , ( b ) 3 , and ( c ) 5 gev/@xmath1 .",
    "results are compared with an initial state averaged event and four different random events from the fluctuating ic.,width=453 ]",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] ( left panel ) shows our results for thermal photon spectra from a smooth and from fluctuating ic for 200a gev au+au collisions at rhic along with phenix data  @xcite for the 0 - 20 % centrality bin .",
    "the result from the fluctuating ic scenario is obtained by averaging photon spectra from a sufficiently large number of random events .",
    "the smooth profile is obtained by taking an average of 1000 initial profiles which is enough to remove essentially all the fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "we see that for both the smooth and the fluctuating ic , the spectra are dominated by radiation from the qgp phase in the entire @xmath2 range shown in the figure .",
    "we further notice that even with a much smaller freeze - out temperature ( @xmath19  120 mev ) we get significant contributions only below @xmath20 1.5 gev/@xmath1 as shown by the brown dashed dotted line in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the slope of the photon @xmath2 spectrum from the fluctuating ic is about 10% flatter compared to the slope from the smooth ic in the region @xmath0 gev/@xmath1 . for @xmath21 gev/@xmath1 , with the fluctuating ic we obtain 20 - 40% more photons than with the smooth profile , whereas for @xmath22 gev/@xmath1 the two results differ almost by a factor of 2 . we know that the thermal emission of photons is exponential in temperature and linear in radiating volume . as a result ,",
    "the hotspots in the fluctuating ic produce more high @xmath2 photons than the smooth profile and the difference between the two ic increases towards higher values of transverse momentum .",
    "we find that the photon results from the fluctuating ic show a better agreement with the phenix experimental data for @xmath0 gev/@xmath1 leaving enough space for the other sources of direct photons besides the thermal contribution .",
    "the thermal photon production from the fluctuating ic is found to be quite sensitive to the value of the fluctuation size parameter @xmath8 , where the enhancement in the production compared to a smooth ic is found to be maximal towards smaller values of @xmath8 and also for larger values of @xmath2 ( see right panel of figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the time evolution of thermal photon yield for different values of @xmath2 is shown in figure  [ fig2 ] which clearly explains the dynamics leading to the results presented in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "we see that most of the high @xmath2 photons are emitted from very early stage of the system expansion and their production drops by a few order of magnitude within a couple of fm/@xmath1 .",
    "we further notice that the cold events ( or events having less than average entropy ) produce more high @xmath2 photons than the smooth ic for @xmath23 gev/@xmath1 .",
    "the centrality dependence of the results is shown in figure  [ fig3 ] ( left panel ) where the difference between the smooth and fluctuating ic is found to increase from central to peripheral collisions .",
    "the size of the produced system becomes smaller towards peripheral collisions and the effect of the hot spots in the fluctuating ic becomes more pronounced , leading to the shown result .",
    "we have also noticed that the effect of initial state fluctuations in the excess production of high @xmath2 photons is weaker at lhc than at rhic  @xcite ( see right panel of figure  [ fig3 ] ) .    in conclusion",
    ", we see that fluctuations in the initial density distribution enhance significantly the production of thermal photons compared to a smooth initial state averaged profile in ideal hydrodynamic calculation .",
    "this is an early time effect solely due to the presence of hotspots in the fluctuating ic and this effect is found to be stronger towards peripheral collisions .",
    "this calls for a more detailed study of the effects of fluctuations for lower beam energies and for smaller size systems .",
    "in addition to that , estimation of photon elliptic flow from the fluctuating ic will be very interesting .",
