    "the fwhm of the emission component of h@xmath11 was about 1000 km s@xmath2 , and the absorption component was blue shifted from the emission peak by about 880 km s@xmath2 .",

    "the next spectrum taken by beaky ( 2008 ) on march 11.46 ut , showed prominent emission lines of h@xmath11 and h@xmath3 and large fe ii emission lines which confirmed that the nova was of the fe ii class .",
    "the near - ir observations reported by ashok & banerjee ( 2008 ) that were taken on march 14 , also showed that the spectra are typical of a classical nova showing prominent h i emission lines of pa@xmath3 , pa@xmath4 and br@xmath4 and other brackett - series lines .",

    "we do not find any evidence of thermal emission from dust .",
    "the absence of dust formation , together with the relatively rapid appearance of coronal lines support the notion that v2468 cyg was an fe iib type nova .",

    "for the first epoch 2008 march 13 , there is a strong ca ii triplet that is partially blended with 0.8446 @xmath1 m and the lines are broad with complex profiles .",

    "we also estimated the mass of the white dwarf @xmath19 @xmath12 1.1m@xmath8 ( livio 1992 ) .",
    "this suggests that nova v2468 cyg may have been originated from a massive wd .",
    "williams(1992 ) has suggested a new class of novae which display characteristics of both ` feii ' and ` he / n ' classes and these are referred to as ` hybrid ' or ",
    "the observed spectral lines of ` hybrid ' novae are broader than the ones typically seen in ` feii ' nova and subsequently exhibit characteristics of ` he / n ' novae like strong he / n lines .",
    "the observed fwhm of hi lines in v2468 cyg in the early decline phase range from 1800 to 2300 km s@xmath2 ( fig .",
    "6 ) which are larger compared to those seen in typical ` feii ' novae .",
    "a remarkable and rapid increase in the strength of hei lines starting from day 33 after the outburst ( 2008 april 9 ) is seen as observed in he / n novae e.g. kt eri ( raj et al . 2013 ) .",
    "an extension of the optical classification scheme to the near - infrared by banerjee and ashok ( 2012 ) distinguishes these two classes by the presence of strong ci lines in ",
    "feii novae and their absence in ` he / n ' novae .",
    "the spectra of v2468 cyg displayed in figs .",
    "2 - 4 clearly show that the strong ci lines seen in the initial spectra quickly fade away .",
    "a similar behaviour and spectral evolution was seen in v574 pup that was classified by naik et al.(2010 ) as ` hybrid ' nova .",
    "we thus suggest a ` hybrid ' classification for v2468 cyg . at the optical wavelengths the signatures of the ` hybrid ' class of novae are the spectral features of heii 3923 , 6683 , 6891  , nii 5001 , 5479 , 6482  , and ni 7452 .",
    "the optical spectra of v2468 cyg show the presence of nii 5679  , line on 2008 march 10 ( iijima & naito 2011 ) , traces of nii 5938  , on 2008 march 23 and nii 6482  , on 2008 may 22 ( tarasova 2013 ) .",
    "the presence of spectral lines of he and n at such early epochs is consistent with our suggestion that v2468 cyg belongs to the ` hybrid ' class of nova .",
    "an example of well studied nova that showed transition between feii and he / n spectral classes is the recent 2011 outburst of recurrent nova t pyx . unlike hybrid novae t pyx showed transition from he / n to feii spectral class ( izzo et al . 2012 and surina et al . 2014 ) .",
    "the high resolution spectroscopic observations of t pyx by shore et al .",
    "( 2011 ) reported absorption line systems that show an accelerated displacement in velocity and they attribute these features to a fast moving tenuous outer envelope .",
    "the optical spectroscopic observations of v2468 cyg by chochol et al .",
    "( 2012 ) show absorption components in the h@xmath11 emission feature indicating the presence of an expanding outer envelope .    as williams ( 2012 )",
    "has pointed out , the feii spectral features are formed in a post - outburst wind while the he / n spectral features arise in discrete expanding shells . it is likely that in case of hybrid novae the spectrum is dominated by the feii lines with weak emission from he & n in the initial phase and then changes over to the he / n class as the nova evolves to the nebular phase .",
    "the slow moving optically thick discrete shells with lower ionization are responsible for the spectral feature of feii class in the initial phase and these are replaced by the optically thin shells with increased ionization , responsible for the spectral features of he / n class in later phase .",
    "the geometry of the ejecta could be another likely reason for the hybrid nature of selected novae .",
    "if the underlying white dwarf in the nova happens to be massive - a value of 1.1 m@xmath8 is estimated for v2468 cyg in section 3.3 and tarasova ( 2013 ) - it may have magnetic field that could be strong enough to influence the expanding ejecta and change its geometry .",
    "the detection of any deviations from the spherical geometry by high angular resolution observations of hybrid novae will give credence to the idea that their ejecta are concentrated in jets .",
    "the recent addition to the list of hybrid novae , namely , v5558 sgr ( das et al . 2015 ) and v5588 sgr ( munari et al . 2015 ) suggests that the transition between feii and he / n class in novae may be more frequent than was believed in earlier years .",

    "5 . however , we find that the strengths of these lines , relative to each other deviate considerably ( specially for br@xmath4 ) from case b values for 2008 march 13 and 2008 april 12 clearly indicates that the observed line intensities are different from case b values ( storey & hummer 1995 ) .",
    "this is not surprising given the strength of the o i lines that are fluorescently excited by ly@xmath3 . for this process to occur so productively , h@xmath11 must be optically thick , which violates the criterion for case b conditions .",

    "<S> we present infrared spectroscopic and photometric observations of the nova v2468 cyg covering the period from 2008 march 13 till 2008 november 11 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 spectra of the object have been taken from the mount abu infrared observatory using the near - infrared imager / spectrometer . </S>",
    "<S> spectra from 0.8 - 5.2 @xmath1 m are also presented that were obtained using the nasa infrared telescope facility and the spex instrument . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra are dominated by strong h i lines from the brackett and paschen series , feii , oi and ci lines in the initial days , typical of an fe ii type nova . </S>",
    "<S> the lines were broader in the period immediately after outburst with measured fwhm of 1800 - 2300 km s@xmath2 for the pa@xmath3 and br@xmath4 lines . </S>",
    "<S> these values narrowed to 1500 - 1600 km s@xmath2 by 12 days from outburst . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra showed prominent he i lines at 1.0830 and 2.0581 @xmath1 m together with h i and o i emission features after 36 days from outburst . </S>",
    "<S> our ir observations show the comparatively broad emission lines , the rapid development of the spectrum to higher ionization , the early appearance of coronal lines , and the absence of dust emission , all features that indicate the hybrid nature of the nova . </S>",
    "<S> this is perhaps the most extensively observed example of a probable fe iib type nova at the infrared wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> we also notice a short lived emission line of fe ii at 2.0888@xmath1 m which was present between april 9 , 2008 to may 9 , 2008 . </S>",
    "<S> no dust emission is seen from the nova ejecta . </S>",
    "<S> we have also estimated the range for the ejecta mass in v2468 cyg to be 3 @xmath5 10@xmath6 - 10@xmath7m@xmath8 . </S>"
