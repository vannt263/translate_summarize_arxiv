    "even when we are interested only in the absolute value of the total partition function , we need to care about the relative phase of each contribution .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to determine appropriate phase factors in the holonomy sum in some gauge theories and look for a general rule for these phases .",
    "we consider two gauge theories which are known to have dual field theories without vector multiplet .",
    "on one side of the dualities , in the non - gauge theories , we can compute the absolute value of the partition function up to overall constant factor independent of parameters . by comparing the partition functions of gauge and non - gauge theories in each dual pair ,",
