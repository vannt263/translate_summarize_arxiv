    "any realization of fermions on the lattice has to respect the constraints imposed by the nielsen - ninomiya theorem @xcite . whereas wilson fermions break chiral symmetry explicitly , ginsparg - wilson fermions @xcite have an exact chiral symmetry on the lattice that is generated by composite local lattice operators @xcite . in both cases , the continuum chiral flavor mixing symmetry and the anomaly are to be properly reproduced as the cutoff is removed .    in a recent paper @xcite it was shown that under very general conditions on the lattice dirac operator , which , in particular , are satisfied both for wilson and for ginsparg - wilson fermions , the axial anomaly is correctly generated in the continuum limit .",
    "the main conditions are gauge invariance , absense of doublers , and locality on the lattice in a more general sense . the origin of the anomaly is traced back to an irrelevant , local lattice operator in the axial vector ward identity .    for ginsparg - wilson fermions , the composite operator in the chiral transformation which ensures an exact flavor mixing symmetry on the lattice , stays irrelevant under renormalization @xcite . as a consequence , the axial vector current does not require renormalization .",
