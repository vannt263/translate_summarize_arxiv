    "the neutral currents lead to the pnc electron - nuclear interaction and can be observed in atomic experiments @xcite . in this paper",
    "we propose that enhanced pnc effects can be seen in electron recombination of multiply charged ions ( mci ) .",

    "a successful observation of pnc effects in optical experiments with heavy neutral atoms ( see the recent review @xcite for references ) has renewed the interest in pnc effects in mci @xcite .",
    "the obvious advantage of mci is the @xmath8 scaling of the pnc matrix elements with the nuclear charge @xmath9 , as opposed to @xmath10 scaling in neutral atoms @xcite .",
    "however , this advantage is usually compensated by larger energy differences between the levels of opposite parity .",
    "indeed , pnc effects in atoms and ions appear because of the mixing of the levels of opposite parity .",
    "this mixing leads , for example , to an admixture of a negative - parity state @xmath11 to a positive - parity state @xmath12 due to the parity nonconserving weak interaction @xmath13 , @xmath14 , as determined by the first - order perturbation expression @xmath15 the mixing coefficient @xmath16 is real when the level width @xmath17 is negligible compared to the level spacing @xmath18 . in neutral atoms the valence energies are roughly independent of @xmath9 , and",

    "the level energies @xmath20 are proportional to @xmath21 and a typical pnc mixing @xmath19 again scales as @xmath10 .    in some special cases",
    "the levels of opposite parity in mci can be anomalously close .",
    "for example , levels of the configurations @xmath22 and @xmath23 in he - like ions cross several times as @xmath9 varies @xcite .",
    "their proximity leads to a strong enhancement of the pnc effects . at the crossing point ( @xmath24 )",

    "two opposite - parity levels with the total angular momentum @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , cross twice at larger @xmath9 , around 65 and 90 @xcite . for such ions one can expect enhanced nuclear - spin - independent ( nsi ) pnc effects . in both cases the detection schemes involve radiative transitions .    in this paper",
    "we propose to study pnc mixing in he - like ions by looking at the parity - violating asymmetry in kll dielectronic recombination ( dr ) of electrons with h - like ions . here",
    "the pnc interaction manifests itself as a difference between the recombination cross sections for electrons with positive and negative helicities .",
    "the observation of such difference means a correlation between the spin and momentum of the incident electron of the form @xmath32 , which does violate parity , since @xmath33 is a vector and @xmath34 is a pseudovector ( @xmath35 , while @xmath36 under spatial inversion ) .",
    "the pnc interaction in dr mixes the intermediate doubly excited @xmath37 and @xmath38 states of the he - like ion , which decay by the emission of a photon . in this respect",
    "pnc effects in dr are similar to those in neutron scattering from heavy nuclei .",
    "pnc asymmetries of up to 10% have been observed in nuclei by tuning the neutron energy to the @xmath39-wave compound nuclear resonances .",
    "this enhancement over the typical size of the nuclear weak interaction ( @xmath40 ) is caused by the proximity of @xmath41- and @xmath39-wave resonances , and by the large ratio of the @xmath41- to @xmath39-wave neutron capture amplitudes ( see , e.g. , review @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "kll dielectronic recombination can be observed in experiments with electron beam ion traps ( ebits ) or ion storage rings ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "furthermore , the present generation of devices do not achieve the sensitivity required to observe the pnc effect .",
    "criteria for the sensitivity requirements are outlined in section  [ discuss_sect ] from which the feasibility can be established for any future experimental devices .",
