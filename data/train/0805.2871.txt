    "the harp experiment  @xcite makes use of a large - acceptance spectrometer for a systematic study of hadron production on a large range of target nuclei for beam momenta from 1.5  @xmath3to 15  @xmath3 .",
    "this corresponds to a proton momentum region of great interest for neutrino beams and far from coverage by earlier dedicated hadroproduction experiments @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the main motivations are to measure pion yields for a quantitative design of the proton driver of a future neutrino factory  @xcite , to provide measurements to allow substantially improved calculations of the atmospheric neutrino flux  @xcite to be made and to measure particle yields as input for the flux calculation of accelerator neutrino experiments  @xcite , such as k2k  @xcite , miniboone  @xcite and sciboone  @xcite .",
    "this paper presents our final measurements of the double - differential cross - section , @xmath5 for @xmath0 production at large angles by protons of 3  @xmath3 , 5  @xmath3 , 8  @xmath3 , 8.9  @xmath3(be only ) , 12  @xmath3 and 12.9  @xmath3(al only ) momentum impinging on a thin beryllium , carbon , aluminium , copper , tin , tantalum or lead target of 5% nuclear interaction length .",
    "a first set of results on the production of pions at large angles have been published by the harp collaboration in references @xcite , based on the analysis of the data in the beginning of each accelerator spill .",
    "the reduction of the data set was necessary to avoid problems in the tpc detector responsible for dynamic distortions to the image of the particle trajectories as the ion charge was building up during each spill .",
    "corrections that allow the use of the full statistics to be made , correcting for such distortions , have been developed in @xcite and are fully applied in this analysis .",
    "the obtained results are fully compatible within the statistical errors and differential systematic uncertainties with those previously published .",
    "the increase of statistics is particularly useful in the 3 @xmath3data sets .",
    "comparisons with montecarlo models are then shown for a light and a heavy target .",
    "this paper , covering an extended range of solid targets in the same experiment , makes it possible to perform systematic comparison of hadron production models with measurements at different incoming beam momenta over a large range of target atomic number @xmath6 .",
    "results for pion production in the forward direction are the subject of other harp publications @xcite .",
    "pion production data at low momenta ( @xmath7 mev / c ) are extremely scarce and harp is the first experiment to provide a large data set , taken with many different targets , full particle identification and large detector acceptance .",
    "in addition , the acceptance of the large - angle detector of the harp experiment matches well the required phase space region of pions relevant to the production of @xmath8 s in a neutrino factory ( nf ) .",
    "it covers the large majority of the pions accepted in the focussing system of a typical design . for the optimization of the nf target ,",
    "data were taken with high-@xmath9 nuclear targets such as tantalum and lead .",
    "data were taken in the t9 beam of the cern ps .",
    "the collected statistics , for the different nuclear targets , are reported in table [ tab : events ] .",
    "the analysis proceeds by selecting tracks in the time projection chamber ( tpc ) , after corrections for static and dynamic distortions ( see later for details ) , in events with incident beam of protons . momentum and polar angle measurements and particle identification",
    "are based on the measurements of track position and energy deposition in the tpc .",
    "an unfolding method is used to correct for experimental resolution , efficiency and acceptance and to obtain the double - differential pion production cross - sections .",
    "the method allows a full error evaluation to be made .",
    "a comparison with available data is presented .",
    "the analysis follows the same methods as used for the determination of @xmath0 production by protons on a tantalum target which are described in ref .",

    "the harp detector is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : harp ] and is fully described in reference @xcite . the forward spectrometer , mainly used in the analysis for the conventional neutrino beams and atmospheric neutrino flux , comprises of a dipole magnet , large planar drift chambers ( ndc )  @xcite , a time - of - flight wall ( tofw ) @xcite , a threshold cerenkov counter ( che ) and an electromagnetic calorimer ( ecal ) . in the large - angle region a cylindrical tpc with a radius of 408  @xmath10is positioned inside a solenoidal magnet with a field of 0.7  @xmath11 .",
    "the tpc detector was designed to measure and identify tracks in the angular region from 0.25  @xmath12to 2.5  @xmath12with respect to the beam axis .",
    "the target is placed inside the inner field cage ( ifc ) of the tpc such that , in addition to particles produced in the forward direction , backward - going tracks can be measured .",
    "the tpc is used for tracking , momentum determination and measurement of the energy deposition @xmath13for particle identification  @xcite .",
    "a set of resistive plate chambers ( rpc ) form a barrel inside the solenoid around the tpc to measure the arrival time of the secondary particles  @xcite .",
    "charged particle identification ( pid ) can be achieved by measuring the ionization per unit length in the gas ( @xmath13 ) as a function of the total momentum of the particle .",
    "additional pid can be performed through a time - of - flight measurement with the rpcs .",
    "the momentum of the t9 beam is known with a precision of the order of 1%  @xcite .",
    "the absolute normalization of the number of incident protons was performed using a total of 1,148,120 incident proton triggers .",
    "these are triggers where the same selection on the beam particle was applied but no selection on the interaction was performed .",
    "the rate of this trigger was down - scaled by a factor 64",
    ". a cross - check of the absolute normalization was provided by counting tracks in the forward spectrometer .",
    "beam instrumentation provides identification of the incoming particle , the determination of the time when it hits the target , and the impact point and direction of the beam particle on the target .",
    "it is based on a set of four multi - wire proportional chambers ( mwpc ) to measure position and direction of the incoming beam particles and time - of - flight detectors and n@xmath14-filled cherenkov counters to identify incoming particles .",
    "several trigger detectors are installed to select events with an interaction and to define the normalization .    besides the usual need for calibration of the detector",
    ", a number of hardware shortfalls , discovered mainly after the end of data - taking , had to be overcome to use the tpc data reliably in the analysis .",
    "the tpc is affected by a relatively large number of dead or noisy pads and static and dynamic distortions of the reconstructed trajectories .",
    "the applied corrections are briefly resumed in the next section .",
    "the beam of positive particles used for this measurement contains mainly positrons , pions and protons , with small components of kaons and deuterons and heavier ions .",
    "its composition depends on the selected beam momentum .",

    "allows the selection of pions from protons to be made at more than 5@xmath15 .",
    "deuterons ( and heavier ions ) are removed by tof measurements .",
    "the selection of protons for the beam momenta with the cherenkov detectors has been described in detail in ref  @xcite .",
    "more details on the beam particle selection can be found in ref .",
    "the purity of the selection of protons is higher than 99% at all momenta .",
    "a set of mwpcs is used to select events with only one beam particle for which the trajectory extrapolates to the target .",
    "an identical beam particle selection was performed for events triggered with the incident - proton trigger in order to provide an absolute normalization of the incoming protons .",
    "this trigger selected every 64@xmath16 beam particle coincidence outside the dead - time of the data acquisition system .",
    "the length of the accelerator spill is 400  ms with a typical intensity of 15  000 beam particles per spill . the average number of events recorded by the data acquisition ranges from 300 to 350 per spill for the different beam momenta .",
    "the analysis proceeds by first selecting a beam proton hitting the target , not accompanied by other tracks .",
    "then an event is required to give a large angle interaction ( lai ) trigger to be retained .",
    "after the event selection the sample of tracks to be used for analysis is defined .",
    "table  [ tab : events ] shows the number of events and the number of @xmath0 selected in the analysis .",
    "the large difference between the first and second set of rows ( `` total events taken by the daq '' and `` accepted protons with large angle interaction '' ) is due to the relatively large fraction of pions in the beam and to the larger number of triggers taken for the measurements with the forward dipole spectrometer .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]      the tpc contains a relatively large number of dead or noisy pads .",
    "noisy pads were considered equivalent to dead channels in this analysis . the large number of dead pads ( @xmath17 ) in the experimental data taking required a day - by - day determination of the dead channel map .",
    "the same map was used in the simulation to provide a description of the tpc performances on a short term scale . a method based on tracks accumulated during the data taking",
    "was used to measure the gain variations of each pad , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "it is used to reduce the fluctuations in response between different pads down to a @xmath18 level .",
    "static distortions on reconstructed tracks are caused by the inhomogeneity of the electric field , due to an accidental mismatch between the inner and outer field cage ( powered by two distinct hv supplies ) .",
    "the day  by  day variations of this mismatch are consistent with the specifications of the stability and reproducibility of the power supplies . a specific calibration for each setting has been made .",
    "dynamic distortions are caused instead by the build - up of ion - charge density in the drift volume during the 400  ms long beam spill .",
    "all these effects were fully studied and available corrections are described in detail in ref .  @xcite . in our",
    "earlier published analyses a practical approach has been followed . only the events corresponding to the early part of the spill , where the effects of the dynamic distortions are still small , have been used ( this translates into a cut on the maximum number of events ( @xmath19 ) to be retained ) . the time interval between spills is large enough to drain all charges in the tpc related to the effect of the beam . the combined effect of the distortions on the kinematic quantities used in the analysis has been studied in detail and only that part of the data for which the systematic errors can be assessed with physical benchmarks was used , as fully explained in @xcite . more than @xmath20 of the recorded data were thus used in the published analyses .",
    "the influence of distortions was monitored taking the average value of the extrapolated minimum distance of the secondary tracks from the incoming beam particle trajectory @xmath21 .",
    "an example of the result of the corrections for one setting is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn ] .         in the presented analysis , instead",
    ", the tpc track dynamic distortions are corrected on an event  by  event basis , as outlined in @xcite . a direct measurement of the distortions as a function of the radius @xmath22 and time  in ",
    "spill was performed using the prediction of the trajectory of the recoil proton in elastic scattering events on a liquid hydrogen target .",
    "the measurement of the direction of the forward scattered proton determined the kinematics and predicts the trajectory of the recoil proton .",
    "the actual measurements in the chamber are then compared with the prediction as a funtion of time .",
    "in addition to this direct measurement also a model of ion charges and their effect was developed .",
    "the strength of the effect depends on many parameters such as the beam intensity , the momentum and the target .",
    "an iterative procedure is applied to find the value of the strength parameter until @xmath21 is flattened down to @xmath23 mm , by using the empirical model described below to shape the corrections .",
    "taking into account the beam intensity , the data acquisition rate and the target thickness , the harp experiment was operated in conditions of @xmath24 deadtime .",
    "the electrons are normally multiplied near the tpc plane with a multiplication factor @xmath25 , producing an equivalent number of ar ions .",
    "any inefficiency of the gating grid at the @xmath26 level would give an overwhelming number of ions drifting in the tpc gas volume .",
    "the phenomenological model is based on the fact that the field which is responsible for the force acting on each drift electron is equivalent to :    * a field system where ions , in a given angular section at @xmath22 values internal to the drift electron position contribute to attract the drift electrons inwards ; * a field system where ions , in a given angular section at @xmath22 values external to the drift electron position , contribute to attract the drift electrons outwards .",
    "this model makes it possible to understand all the peculiar features of the tpc dynamic distortions :    * the dependence of the distortion on the event number in the spill , * the dependence of the distortion on tracks generated at different longitudinal coordinate @xmath9 in the tpc .",
    "in particular tracks produced at increasingly larger @xmath9 exhibit the distortion saturation at increasingly later times and the distortions tend to zero at @xmath9 values already passed by the ion packet ; * the dependence of the distortion of cosmic - ray tracks collected out of the spill as a function of time and @xmath9 , with the non - trivial fact that cosmic - rays just after the spill are more distorted than the cosmic - rays taken later ; * the @xmath27 dependence as measured with elastic scattering .",
    "the distortions have a peculiar behaviour as a function of the tpc pad rows : from the @xmath28 calculation it follows that the inner rows are distorted by a radial electric field pointing inwards ; there exists a pad row around the middle of the chamber where the radial electric field vanishes .",
    "the corrections , provided by the model , calibrated on a run - by - run basis allow a full control of the tpc response along the spill . in figure",
    "[ fig : model ] the @xmath29 spectrum for p  be interactions at 8.9 gev / c is shown separately for the first 50 events in the spill , the next 50 and so on up to the last 50 , before and after the dynamic distortion correction .",
    "after the correction , the curves are compatible within the statistical errors , indicating that the correction is adequate .",
    "the main point , using beginning of spill data or full spill data , is the presence of possible residual momentum bias in the tpc measurement due to the dynamic distortions .",
    "a dedicated paper  @xcite addresses this point and shows that our estimation of momentum bias is below @xmath30 , although the systematics can in principle be different in the uncorrected begin - of - spill data and the fully corrected data . from the studies made",
    "we conclude that the data of the full spill can be used for the analysis once the corrections for dynamic distortions have been applied . in a small number of data sets the distortions in the last part of the spill are too large to be reliably corrected .",
    "these are mainly high @xmath6 , high beam momentum settings , where sufficient statistics are available even without this part of the spill .",
    "the reliability of the correction has been checked by observing the stability as a function of the event number in the spill of the average momentum of protons in a small window of large @xmath13 .",
    "an additional benchmark assesses the stability of the momentum measurement inside a spill after the dynamic distortion correction for the tpc tracks .",

    "only a short outline of the data analysis procedure is presented here , for further details see ref .",
    "the most relevant difference is the use of the full spill statistics by means of a correction of the dynamic distortions in the tpc tracks , as outlined before .",
    "the double - differential cross - section for the production of a particle of type @xmath38 can be expressed in the laboratory system as :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is expressed in bins of true momentum ( @xmath41 ) , angle ( @xmath42 ) and particle type ( @xmath38 ) . @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the bin sizes in momentum and and angle , respectively .    the ` raw yield ' @xmath45 is the number of particles of observed type @xmath46 in bins of reconstructed momentum ( @xmath47 ) and angle ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "these particles must satisfy the event , track and pid selection criteria .",
    "although , owing to the stringent pid selection , the background from misidentified protons in the pion sample is small , the pion and proton raw yields ( @xmath45 , for @xmath49 ) have been measured simultaneously .",

    "the background due to interactions of the primary protons outside the target ( called ` empty target background ' ) is measured using data taken without the target mounted in the target holder . owing to the selection criteria which only accept events from the target region and the good definition of the interaction point this background is negligible ( @xmath59 ) .",

    "it is shown that the pion yield increases with momentum and that in our kinematic coverage the optimum yield is between 5  @xmath3and 8  @xmath3 .",

    "are also given : a restricted angular range ( @xmath68 ) and a range further restricted in momentum ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the latter range may be most representative for the neutrino factory .",
    "of course this analysis only gives a simplified picture of the results .",
    "one should note that the best result can be obtained by using the full information of the double - differential cross - section and by developing designs optimized specifically for each single beam momentum . then these optimized designs can be compared .",
    "the experimental uncertainties are summarized for @xmath70 in table  [ tab : errors-3 ] for all used targets and shown for two typical targets ( one light and one heavy ) in figure  [ fig : syst ] .",
    "they are very similar for @xmath71 and at the other beam energies : 3 , 5 , 8 , 12 and 12.9 gev / c .",
    "going from lighter ( be , c ) to heavier targets ( ta , pb ) the corrections for @xmath72 ( conversion ) and absorption / tertiares are bigger .",
    "one observes that only for the 3  @xmath3beam is the statistical error similar in magnitude to the systematic error , while the statistical error is negligible for the 8  @xmath3and 12  @xmath3beam settings .",
    "the statistical error is calculated by error propagation as part of the unfolding procedure .",
    "it takes into account that the unfolding matrix is obtained from the data themselves   and hence contributes also to the statistical error .",
    "this procedure almost doubles the statistical error , but avoids an important systematic error which would otherwise be introduced by assuming a cross - section model _ a priori _ to calculate the corrections .",
    "the largest systematic error corresponds to the uncertainty in the absolute momentum scale , which was estimated to be around 3% using elastic scattering  @xcite . although the corrections for the dynamic distortions have been applied in this analysis , contrary to the previously published ones , the systematic error has not been reduced .",
    "this is due to the fact that now the full statistics has been used introducing data with larger distortions .",
    "the benefit of the introduction of the larger statistics is evident mainly at low incident beam momenta ( 3 gev / c ) , in the bins with higher secondary momenta and larger scattering angle . at low momentum in the relatively small angle forward direction",
    "the uncertainty in the subtraction of the electron and positron background due to @xmath73production is dominant ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "this uncertainty is split between the variation in the shape of the @xmath73spectrum and the normalization using the recognized electrons .",
    "the target region definition and the uncertainty in the pid efficiency and background from tertiaries ( particles produced in secondary interactions ) are of similar size and are not negligible ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "relatively small errors are introduced by the uncertainties in the absorption correction , absolute knowledge of the angular and the momentum resolution .",
    "the correction for tertiaries is relatively large at low momenta and large angles ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "as expected , this region is most affected by this component .",
    "the errors are quoted for the positive pion data .",
    "owing to the similarity of the spectra the errors are very similar for the negative pions .",
    "as already mentioned above , the overall normalization has an uncertainty of 2% , and is not reported in the table .",
    "it is mainly due to the uncertainty in the efficiency that beam protons counted in the normalization actually hit the target , with smaller components from the target density and beam particle counting procedure .      as our final results , obtained with a full correction of the distortions of tpc tracks ( static+dynamic ) , are compatible with our preliminary ones published in @xcite , we refer to these papers for a comparison with published data .",
    "we only stress here that previous data sets are scarce , with big total errors and cover only a limited region of the phase space covered by the harp experiment .    in the following",
    "we will show only some comparisons with publicly available montecarlo simulations : geant4  @xcite and mars  @xcite , using different models .",
    "we stress that no tuning to our data has been done by the geant4 or mars teams .",
    "the comparison will be shown for a limited set of plots and only for the c and ta targets , as examples of a light and a heavy target nucleus , in figures [ fig : g43a ] to [ fig : g56 ] .    at intermediate energies (",
    "up to 5 - 10 gev ) , geant4 uses two types of intra - nuclear cascade models : the bertini model  @xcite ( valid up to @xmath77 gev ) and the binary model  @xcite ( valid up to @xmath78 gev ) .",
    "both models treat the target nucleus in detail , taking into account density variations and tracking in the nuclear field .",
    "the binary model is based on hadron collisions with nucleons , giving resonances that decay according to their quantum numbers .",
    "the bertini model is based on the cascade code reported in @xcite and hadron collisions are assumed to proceed according to free - space partial cross sections and final state distributions measured for the incident particle types .    at higher energies , instead ,",
    "two parton string models , the quark - gluon string ( qgs ) model  @xcite and the fritiof ( ftp ) model  @xcite are used , in addition to a high energy parametrized model ( hep ) derived from the high energy part of the gheisha code used inside geant3  @xcite .",
    "the parametrized models of geant4 ( hep and lep ) are intended to be fast , but conserve energy and momentum on average and not event by event .",
    "a realistic geant4 simulation is built by combining models and physics processes into what is called a `` physics list '' . in high energy calorimetry",
    "the two most commonly used are the qgsp physics list , based on the qgs model , the pre - compound nucleus model and some of the low energy parametrized ( lep ) model ( that has its root in the gheisha code inside geant3 ) and the lhep physics list  @xcite based on the parametrized lep model and hep models .",
    "the mars code system  @xcite uses as basic model an inclusive approach multiparticle production originated by r.  feynman . above 3  @xmath3phenomenological particle production models are used .",
    "below 5  @xmath3a cascade - exciton model  @xcite combined with the fermi break - up model , the coalescence model , an evaporation model and a multifragmentation extension is used instead .",
    "none of the considered models describe fully our data .",
    "however , backward or central region production seems to be described better than relatively more forward production , especially at higher incident momenta . in our data",
    ", the lowest angular bin corresponds to a transition region from forward to central production , that is more difficult to describe by mc models .    in general , @xmath70 production is better described than @xmath71 production . at higher energies",
    "the ftp model ( from geant4 ) and the mars model describe better the data , while at the lowest energies the bertini and binary cascade models ( from geant4 ) seem more appropriate .",
    "parametrized models , as lhep from geant4 , show relevant discrepancies : up to a factor three in the forward region at low energies .",
    "the comparison , just outlined in our paper , between data and models shows that the full set of harp data , taken with targets spanning the full periodic table of elements , with small total errors and large coverage of the solid angle with a single detector , may greatly help the tuning of models used in hadronic simulations in the difficult energy range between 3  @xmath3and 15  @xmath3of incident momentum .",
    "an analysis of the production of pions at large angles with respect to the beam direction for protons of 3  @xmath3 , 5  @xmath3 , 8  @xmath3 , 8.9  @xmath3(be only ) , 12  @xmath3and 12.9  @xmath3(al only ) beam momentum impinging on thin ( 5% interaction length ) beryllium , carbon , aluminium , copper , tin , tantalum and lead targets is described .",
    "the secondary pion yield is measured in a large angular and momentum range and double - differential cross - sections are obtained .",
    "a detailed error estimation has been discussed .",
    "results on the dependence from atomic number a of pion production are also presented .",
    "the data taken with the lead and tantalum targets are relevant for the optimization of the targetry of a neutrino factory .",
    "the pion yield increases with momentum and in our kinematic range the optimum is between 5 gev / c and 8 gev / c .",
    "the use of a single detector for a range of beam momenta makes it possible to measure the dependence of the pion yield on the secondary particle momentum and emission angle @xmath79 with high precision .",
    "the @xmath6dependence of the cross - section can be studied , using data from a single experiment .",
    "very few pion production measurements in this energy range are reported in the literature .",
    "the only comparable results found in the literature agrees with the analysis described in this paper .",
    "hadronic production models describing this energy range have now been compared with our new results .",
