    "extra charged ( @xmath8 ) and extra neutral ( @xmath9 ) gauge bosons are predicted by many extensions of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the masses and the couplings of the extra gauge bosons to fermions depend on the free parameters of the theory extending the standard model ( sm )",
    ". they must be determined by experiment .",
    "hence , the observation of extra gauge bosons would teach us an important lesson on physics beyond the sm .",
    "therefore , the search for these particles is included in the research program of every future collider .",
    "recent collider data are consistent with the sm .",
    "in particular , they suggest that extra gauge bosons predicted in grand unified theories ( gut s ) must be heavier than @xmath10500gev @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect that extra gauge bosons would manifest themselves as ( small ) deviations of some observables from the sm predictions at future linear @xmath0 colliders . at lhc",
    ", they would show up through peaks in the invariant mass distribution of their decay products .",
    "two cases are possible . if the sm is confirmed at future colliders , impressive improvements on the exclusion limits on extra gauge bosons can be achieved , see e.g. @xcite for a review and further references . for extra gauge bosons with masses considerably smaller than their search limit in the same reaction",
    ", some information on their masses and couplings can be obtained .",
    "see again @xcite for a review and further references .    in most models , the reactions @xmath11 and @xmath12 are most sensitive to a @xmath9 or @xmath8 .",
    "we suppose here that a signal of extra gauge bosons is detected in one of these reactions and its mass and some of its couplings are measured .    in earlier contributions @xcite , we investigated the potential of the reaction @xmath1 in obtaining search limits for a @xmath8 appearing in different models .",
    "for some models , these limits can compete with those from the lhc .",
    "in contrast to the limits from hadron colliders , the limits from @xmath0 collisions are independent of unknown details of structure functions and quark mixing . this is a good process at an @xmath0 collider for putting bounds on a @xmath8 .    in this contribution",
    ", we show where the reaction @xmath1 can contribute complementary information to the coupling measurements of extra gauge bosons .",
    "a more detailed paper is forthcoming .",
    "we show constraints on the couplings @xmath13 of extra neutral gauge bosons to neutrinos and on the couplings @xmath14 of extra charged gauge bosons to leptons .",
    "the couplings @xmath15 and @xmath16 of the left- and right - handed fermions @xmath17 to the vector boson @xmath18 are defined by the following interaction lagrangian , @xmath19    two - dimensional constraints ( 95% confidence ) correspond to @xmath20 in equation ( [ chi2 ] ) , @xmath21 is the expectation for the observable @xmath22 by the sm , @xmath23 is the prediction of the extension of the sm and @xmath24 is the expected experimental error .",
    "the index @xmath25 numbers different observables as , for example , the total cross section @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the physical input for our numerics is @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote the photon s energy and angle in the @xmath0 center - of - mass , respectively .",
    "we have restricted the range of @xmath30 and @xmath31 as follows : @xmath32 @xmath33 so that the photon may be detected cleanly .",
    "the upper bound on @xmath30 ensures that the photons from the radiative return to the sm @xmath34 resonance are rejected .",
    "as well , the angular cut eliminates the collinear singularity arising when the photon is emitted parallel to the beam .    the most dangerous background to the reaction @xmath1 comes from radiative bhabha scattering .",
    "it can be eliminated by a cut on the transverse momentum of the photon , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the minimum angle for veto detectors .",
    "we take @xmath37mrad .",
    "the unpolarized cross section is composed of polarized cross sections as @xmath38 .",
    "note that @xmath39 only in models where the @xmath8 has non - zero couplings to left- and right - handed fermions simultaneously . even in this case",
    ", we have @xmath40 $ ] due to present experimental bounds on extra gauge bosons and because @xmath41 and @xmath42 do not interfere with the sm .",
    "we consider polarization asymmetries involving polarized electrons only , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and polarization asymmetries involving both polarized beams , @xmath43 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and devote half of the luminosity to each polarization combination .",
    "the case of two polarized beams corresponds to an effective polarization @xmath47 @xcite of the electron beam .",
    "note that the use of the effective polarization is exact for @xmath48 .",
    "if this is not the case , it remains a good approximation .",
    "we assume systematic errors of 1% for both observables @xmath49 and @xmath27 , although we know that this assumption is very optimistic for @xmath49 .",
    "we have performed two independent calculations . in the first calculation",
    ", the squared matrix element was obtained in the conventional trace formalism .",
    "the phase space of the neutrinos was integrated out analytically .",
    "this results in ( rather long ) analytical formulas for the doubly differential cross section @xmath50 .",
    "all analytical integrals were checked numerically to a precision of at least 10 digits .",
    "artificial singularities in the physical phase space appeared from the partial fraction decomposition of the first integration .",
    "these singularities were proven to cancel analytically after the second integration and an appropriate taylor expansion .",
    "all algebraic manipulations were carried out with the algebraic manipulation program form @xcite .",
    "the remaining one ( two ) integrations to obtain simple distributions ( total cross sections ) were done using an adaptive simpson integration routine .    in a second calculation ,",
    "the helicity amplitudes were calculated by spinor techniques .",
    "they were squared numerically and summed over the helicities of the final states .",
    "the result was integrated using monte carlo techniques .",

    "we see that the uncertain knowledge of the @xmath57 couplings leads to weaker constraints on @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "however , figure  [ nng2 ] shows that this effect is only important for a very heavy @xmath9 where its couplings are already weakly constrained .",
    "the influence of the errors of the @xmath57 coupling measurement is negligible for a relatively light @xmath9 .    finally , we mention that there is no sign ambiguity in the measurement of @xmath52 and @xmath53 , if the signs of the @xmath57 couplings are known",
    ". remember @xcite that the @xmath57 couplings have a two - fold sign ambiguity if measured in the reaction @xmath64 alone .",
    "if the sign ambiguity in the @xmath57 couplings is removed @xcite , i.e. by measurements of the reaction @xmath65 below the @xmath9 resonance or by measurements at the @xmath9 resonance , it disappears also in the proposed constraint of @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "in figures  [ nng3 ] to 6 , we assume that there is no signal from a @xmath9 but a signal from a @xmath8 .",
    "this can happen in models where the @xmath8 is considerably lighter than the @xmath9 .",
    "we recognize that this particular scenario is unlikely in the context of the models we consider .",
    "for instance , in the uum model , the w and z masses are approximately equal and there would most likely be a signal observed for the @xmath9 in addition to the @xmath8 .",
    "so it should be understood that our results for the case of a @xmath8 only represent an estimate of the reach of this process in constraining @xmath8 couplings , rather than precision limits in the context of a fuller understanding of the physics realized in nature .",
    "we use this simple scenario in order to indicate sensitivity to various parameters , such as the observables used and the luminosity . in the case of a @xmath9 signal , the knowledge about this particle should be included in the following analysis .",
