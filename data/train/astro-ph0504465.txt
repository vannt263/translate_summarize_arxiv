    "the cosmological picture that has emerged from a host of recent observations is that of a spatially flat universe dominated by an exotic component with positive energy density and negative pressure , the dark energy , which is responsible for the observed accelerated cosmic expansion .",
    "the nature of dark energy remains unknown .",
    "it could be einstein s cosmological constant or the manifestation of a scalar field slowly rolling down its potential , as in quintessence models ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the equation of state , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the pressure and @xmath7 the density of the dark energy ( hereafter referred to as the x - component ) , describes how the x - component evolves as the universe expands .",
    "determining the equation of state will help reveal the nature of dark energy and discriminate among models , as the cosmological constant is characterised by a constant @xmath8 whereas in quintessence models @xmath0 can be different from @xmath9 and vary with cosmic time .",
    "@xmath0 is directly related to the shape of the potential of the quintessence field .",
    "it is a fundamental parameter that remains poorly constrained observationally , partly because of degeneracies with other parameters , mainly @xmath10 and the r.m.s . of the amplitude of fluctuations within 8  @xmath11mpc , @xmath3 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "dark energy not only affects the expansion rate of the background and the distance - redshift relation , but also the growth of structure .",
    "the collapse of overdense regions due to gravitational instability is slowed down by the hubble drag due to the expansion .",
    "this effective friction depends on the expansion of the background .",
    "the formation rate of haloes , their evolution and their final characteristics are modified .",
    "dark energy is therefore expected to have an impact on observables such as cluster number counts and lensing statistics due to intervening concentrations of mass on the line - of - sight of background sources .",
    "the abundance of rich clusters of galaxies can be used to constrain the cosmological model and the properties of dark energy .",
    "this has been discussed first for pure cosmological constant models ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and then for models with dark energy where @xmath0 could be different from @xmath9 . in a seminal paper @xcite",

    "following up on that paper , @xcite , @xcite have examined cluster formation in models with constant @xmath0 . @xcite",

    "@xcite have used @xmath12-body simulations in flat models with constant @xmath0 to measure cluster mass functions .    in this paper , we first discuss the linear evolution of perturbations in dark energy models with constant @xmath0 .",
    "then , we use the non - linear spherical model ( `` top - hat '' model first developed by @xcite ) . rather than using the approximation given by @xcite which is strictly valid for @xmath8 , we calculate explicitely the potential energy associated with the dark energy component inside the collapsing sphere and the ratio of the radius of the sphere at virialisation to the turn - around radius .",
    "we follow the evolution of overdense regions as they first expand with the background before collapsing and settling into virialised structures .",
    "we then calculate the abundance of massive clusters in the @xcite framework .",
    "we use the @xcite extension which has been shown to be in remarkable agreement with results from @xmath12-body simulations of hierarchical structure formation .",
    "we use five cosmological models , all with @xmath13 kms@xmath14mpc@xmath14 : three dark energy models with the same energy content : @xmath10=0.3 , @xmath15=0.7 , but that differ in their value of @xmath0 : @xmath2cdm with @xmath8 , a @xmath16 model , a @xmath17 model , and for comparison an einstein - de sitter model with @xmath18 and an open model with @xmath19 .",
    "we consider a cosmological model with two components : ( 1 ) a non - relativistic component which comprises all forms of matter ( luminous and dark ) that clusters under the action of gravity , and ( 2 ) a uniform x - component with negative pressure which does not cluster at the scales of interest . in general ,",
    "quintessence models have a component that is spatially inhomogeneous but does not cluster on scales less than 100  mpc .",
    "the friedmann equation that describes the evolution of the scale factor @xmath20 with cosmic time is modified to include the effect of the x - component :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the hubble parameter , @xmath23 are the density parameters ( ratios of the energy density to the critical density @xmath24 ) for the matter , the curvature ( @xmath25 ) and the x - component respectively .",
    "the parameters are indexed by 0 when they refer to the present time .",
    "the energy density of the x - component varies as @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "different @xmath28 and @xmath0 correspond to different types of energy densities , with @xmath29 ( @xmath8 ) corresponding to the cosmological constant .",
    "note that @xmath28 does nt need to be either integer or constant .",
    "it may vary with cosmic time , as in kinessence models . in the following we consider only models with constant @xmath28 and @xmath0 .",
    "note also that for @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) , the dark energy term can be combined with the curvature term in the friedmann equation ; @xmath15 cancels out and the expansion is the same as for a @xmath10 universe .",
    "thus a flat universe with @xmath31 behaves like an open universe without dark energy and with the same @xmath10 .",
    "cosmic acceleration ( i.e. , the existence of an inflexion point in the @xmath32 curve ) requires @xmath33 .",

    "universes with a dark energy component are older than with @xmath36 and give perturbations more time to grow .",
    "for the currently favoured parameters the evolution of the scale factor in quintessence models is intermediate between that of a cosmological constant model ( @xmath8 ) and of an open universe .",
    "the density parameters vary with redshift @xmath37 as @xmath38 where @xmath39 . in the case of the cosmological constant",
    "commonly denoted @xmath2 , @xmath40",
    "in linear theory , the evolution of the density contrast of a perturbation @xmath41 is governed by @xmath42 which can be solved numerically .",

    "a @xmath2cdm universe has a higher growth rate than an einstein - de sitter universe throughout its history , but the growth rate drops at redshifts below @xmath50 .",

    ", structure growth will be stronger at early times in an open universe compared to a @xmath2cdm universe , with intermediate rates in quintessence models .",
    "but structure growth is reduced earlier in open and quintessence models , although it is still significantly higher than in @xmath2cdm models .",
    "the equation of motion of a spherical shell in the presence of dark energy is : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the time - varying density inside the forming cluster , and @xmath53 is the effective energy density of the x - component .",
    "@xmath54 is constant for the cosmological constant ; in a universe with a dark energy component with @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) , perturbations evolve in the same way as in a universe with the same @xmath10 and no dark energy . note that for @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) , the density of the x - component inside the overdensity patch is dependent on the evolution of the background .",
    "this makes it impossible to integrate directly the equation of motion and cast it into a first - order energy equation .",

    "we shall follow the evolution of a spherical overdense region with some initial overdensity . at early times",
    ", it expands along with the hubble flow and density perturbations grow proportionally to the scale factor .",
