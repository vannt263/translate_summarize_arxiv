    "overlap fermions @xcite are a realisation of chiral symmetry on the lattice . given some reasonable hermitian - dirac operator @xmath2",
    ", we can deform @xmath2 into a chiral action through the overlap formalism , @xmath3 and @xmath2 will be referred to as the overlap kernel .",
    "examinations of the spectral flow of the overlap kernel can shed considerable light on the nature of the associated overlap operator .",
    "consider for example the spectral flow of figure [ fig : connection ] for overlap fermions based on the standard wilson kernel , reproduced from ref .",
    "@xcite . as the regulator - mass parameter of the wilson kernel",
    "is varied over the doubler - free region ( @xmath4 at tree level ) zero crossings occur , signaling the point at which the associated overlap operator becomes sensitive to the topology giving rise to the zero mode .",
    "the sign of the slope of the kernel flow at the zero crossing indicates the sign of the topological charge giving rise to the zero mode .",
    "as such the flow should only cross zero once .",
    "the position of the zero crossing reflects the size of the underlying topological object @xcite .",
    "smaller objects give rise to zero crossings at larger regulator mass @xmath5 .",
    "in our examinations of the spectral flow of the standard wilson kernel @xcite and the correlation of the eigenmodes with their underlying topological gauge field structures , we encountered a few configurations in which the spectral flow of a single mode would cross zero twice in the doubler free region .",
    "figure  [ fig : wilson ] illustrates the low - lying eigenmode spectrum for two configurations which display a double crossing in one of the modes .",
    "the relation between the hopping parameter @xmath6 and the regulator mass of fig .",
    "[ fig : connection ] is @xmath7 such that the tree - level doubler - free region is @xmath8 for @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath10 gauge - field configurations are generated on a @xmath11 lattice with a mean - field improved plaquette plus rectangle action at @xmath12 providing a lattice spacing of 0.122(2 ) fm .",
    "modes are tracked in the spectral flow by examining their position in space - time .",
    "modes belonging to the same underlying topological structure are plotted with a common symbol in the spectral flow plots .",
    "our experience is that about one in five configurations displays such a double crossing .",
    "figure  [ fig:1lic_flic ] displays the spectral flow for the same configurations but this time evaluated with the fat - link irrelevant clover ( flic)-fermion kernel @xcite constructed with four - sweep ape - smeared fat links with a smearing fraction @xcite of @xmath13 .",
    "flic fermions provide an effective alternative to the wilson kernel as they have an improved condition number which gives rise to a factor of two reduction in compute time . here",
    "the double crossing is removed for one configuration but survives for the other .",
    "the plaquette - based clover estimate of the lattice field - strength tensor @xmath0 is known to be rather poor .",
    "the associated topological charge typically differs from integer values by 10% , even on very smooth configurations @xcite .",
    "since the irrelevant operators of flic fermions are constructed from ape - smeared links , one may use highly - improved @xmath1-improved definitions of the lattice field strength tensor @xcite ; @xmath14 errors are removed in the ape - smearing process . figure  [ fig:3lic_flic ]",
    "illustrates the spectral flow obtained from flic fermions incorporating a three - loop @xmath1-improved definition of the lattice field strength tensor @xcite .",
    "the spurious double crossings are eliminated .",
    "it is perhaps interesting to note that the double - crossings can be eliminated with the wilson kernel provided the irrelevant wilson term is constructed with fat links .",
    "however , a factor of two speedup is not realized for the fat - wilson kernel .",
    "we have been successful in creating spectral flows with a spurious double crossing @xcite by cooling thooft - ansatz instantons on the lattice until their topological charge is reduced to 0.4 .",
    "this suggests to us that the observed double crossings seen with the standard wilson kernel are simply lattice artifacts associated with dislocations .",
    "the fact that the zero crossings always occur at very large values of the regulator parameter further confirms that these double crossings are spurious lattice artifacts due to physics at the scale of the lattice spacing and should be removed .",
    "the three - loop improved flic fermion kernel achieves this goal .",
