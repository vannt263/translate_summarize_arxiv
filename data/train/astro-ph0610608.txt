    "the remarkable binary system ls  i  + 61  303 is one of the best studied microquasars in the sky @xcite .",
    "it consists of a rapidly rotating be star surrounded by a dense circumstellar disk and a compact companion that is a source of both orbital phase modulated x - ray @xcite and radio flux @xcite .",
    "high angular resolution observations suggest that the system has precessing , relativistic radio jets @xcite , and these jets may be the source of variable and very high energy , @xmath1-ray emission @xcite . the companion is generally considered to be a magnetic neutron star , but it may be a black hole @xcite .",
    "the orbital parameters were recently reanalyzed by @xcite who confirmed the high eccentricity of the system and discussed the possible mass range .",
    "their work shows that the orbital phases of the x - ray and radio maxima do not occur at periastron but are curiously delayed by a significant fraction of the orbital period .",
    "the disk that feeds the companion is a strong source of h@xmath0 emission , and there is a well established record of the emission line variations over the past decade @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that some of the emission line properties vary with the orbital period , presumably as the result of the companion s varying gravitational pull .",
    "here we present the results of a new observational effort on the h@xmath0 variations in ls  i  + 61  303 that we launched to investigate the co - variations with the x - ray flux as recorded by the all - sky monitor ( asm ) instrument aboard the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ satellite .",
    "it follows similar investigations of cyg  x-1 @xcite , ls  i  + 65  010 @xcite , and hde  245770 = a  0535 + 26 and x  per @xcite .",
    "we first describe radial velocity measurements and a re - evaluation of the orbital elements in  2 .",
    "then we turn in  3 to the temporal variations observed in the h@xmath0 profile on rapid , orbital , and long term timescales .",
    "we discuss the results in the context of the disk truncation model of @xcite in  4 .",
    "we obtained a set of 100 spectra of ls  i  + 61  303 between 1998 august and 2000 december .",
    "the observations were made with the kitt peak national observatory 0.9  m coud feed telescope during six runs .",
    "we used two spectrograph arrangements to record the red spectral region around h@xmath0 with resolving powers of @xmath2 and 9500 .",
    "the details about the spectra and their reduction are given in a companion paper on ls  i  + 65  010 @xcite .",
    "we also recorded the spectrum of a nearby visual companion , and we discuss its properties in the appendix .",
    "all the spectra record the h@xmath0 emission line and the @xmath3 feature .",
    "the @xmath3 line appears in most spectra as a weak and narrow absorption core flanked by emission wings ( see fig .  2 below ) .",
    "we suspect that this line is a composite of a partial photospheric absorption line with wing emission and central absorption that originates in the inner disk .",
    "we assume that the radial velocity variations of this composite profile represent the motion of the be star since the line formation probably occurs very close to the photosphere of the be star .",
    "we note in passing that the half - width at half - minimum in the absorption core of @xmath3 is 101 km  s@xmath4 in most of our spectra .",
    "this is similar to the projected rotational velocity @xmath5 km  s@xmath4 reported by @xcite , but much smaller than that found earlier by @xcite of @xmath6 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "this suggests that some of the blue spectral lines measured by @xcite may also have been affected by weak emission in the line wings that made the absorption cores appear more narrow .",
    "we measured radial velocities by cross - correlating each spectrum with a template spectrum formed from the average of 24 spectra from our run in 2000 december .",
    "the cross - correlation was made over the spectral region in the immediate vicinity of @xmath3 , although we also included the region surrounding @xmath7 for the spectra from the 2000 october and december runs that also recorded this line .",
    "these relative velocities were transformed to an absolute scale by adding the radial velocity of the template spectrum , @xmath8 km  s@xmath4 , found by parabolic fitting of the cores of @xmath9 .",
    "we also obtained cross - correlation velocities of the interstellar line at 6613   to monitor the radial velocity stability of our measurements .",
    "all these results are reported in table  1 ( given in full in the electronic edition ) that lists the heliocentric julian date of mid - exposure , orbital phase , radial velocity , observed minus calculated residual from the fit , and the interstellar line offset ( plus columns describing the h@xmath0 profile discussed in  3 ) .",
    "the typical measurement error is @xmath10 km  s@xmath4 based upon the scatter between pairs of observations at closely spaced times .",
    "many recent papers on the orbital properties of ls  i  + 61  303 adopt an arbitrary zero - phase at hjd 2,443,366.775 @xcite and an orbital period of @xmath11  d , which was determined by @xcite from a careful study of the radio flux curve .",
    "here we adopt the same convention for orbital phase that we denote by @xmath12 .",
    "we determined orbital elements using the non - linear , least - squares program of @xcite .",
    "we also included the radial velocity data from the recent study by @xcite , but we found that our velocities are systematically lower than theirs by @xmath13 km  s@xmath4 so we added this value to their measurements for ease of comparison .",
    "our first fit using all the available velocities is shown as the dotted line in figure  1 , and the resulting orbital elements are listed in column 4 of table  2 .",
    "the r.m.s .   of this fit is 10.4 km  s@xmath4 , which is about five times larger than the estimated measurement error .",
    "this large scatter is caused by temporal changes in the shape of the @xmath3 profile .",
    "for example , the six very low velocity measurements shown in figure  1 were made during a remarkable episode of reduced h@xmath0 emission strength (  3 ) when the emission wings disappeared and the absorption core became broader .",
    "thus , we selectively zero - weighted these six measurements and five other very discrepant points that also appeared to display profile shape changes .",
    "the fit resulting from this edited set of velocities is shown as a solid line in figure  1 , and the corresponding orbital elements are given in column  5 of table  2 .",
    "our results are generally in good agreement with earlier determinations of the elements by @xcite and @xcite ( given in columns 2 and 3 of table  2 , respectively ) .",
    "the largest range in results is found for the orbital eccentricity @xmath14 , and unfortunately the paucity of measurements in the orbital phase range 0.4  0.5 limits the accuracy of the estimate in our work .",
    "our final result of @xmath15 is somewhat lower than the estimate of @xmath16 from fits of the ir light curve @xcite .",
    "models for the accretion flux variations indicate an eccentricity in the range @xmath17 @xcite to @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "periastron occurs at phase @xmath19 .",
    "this is in reasonable agreement with the expectation from the radio model of @xcite that places the phase of periastron in the range @xmath20 .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission line is formed in the circumstellar disk of the be star , and here we examine the temporal variations in the profile to investigate how the changes in the disk are related to changes in the accretion flux from the vicinity of the companion .",
    "the h@xmath0 profile appears as a double - peaked emission line in most of our spectra , and we made a number of measurements to characterize the shape and strength of the emission .",
    "these measurements are summarized in table  1 .",
    "column  6 of table  1 lists the numerical integration of the line flux that includes the full extent of the line wings . since the emitting gas in the disk probably experiences keplerian rotation @xcite , the high velocity wings are formed closest to the be star .",
    "we measured the radial velocity of the wings based upon a bisector position determined using the method of @xcite .",
    "this method samples the line wings using oppositely signed gaussian functions and determines the mid - point position between the wings by cross - correlating these gaussians with the profile .",
    "we used gaussian functions with fwhm = 200 km  s@xmath4 at sample positions in the wings of @xmath21 km  s@xmath4 , and these radial velocities are given in column 7 of table  1 .",
    "@xcite advocated making fits of the double - peaked h@xmath0 profile using gaussian functions to match the violet @xmath22 and red @xmath23 peaks , and we have followed their approach for consistency .",
    "these double - gaussian fits were restricted to the inner part of the profile ( @xmath24  ) since the wings are much more extended that those of gaussian functions .",
    "the remaining columns in table  1 list the parameters for these fits : radial velocity of the @xmath22 peak ( col .  8) , radial velocity of the @xmath23 peak ( col .",
    "9 ) , ratio of the equivalent widths of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 components ( col .",
    "10 ) , @xmath25 peak intensity ratio ( col .",
    "11 ) , fwhm for the @xmath22 peak ( col .",
    "12 ) , and fwhm for the @xmath23 peak ( col .",
    "we find evidence for temporal variations on timescales of days and longer .",
    "the most dramatic change in the h@xmath0 profile that we observed occurred in 1999 october . during the first three nights of this",
    "run the h@xmath0 profile appeared at normal strength ( top plot in fig .",
    "2 ) , but in the course of 24 hours or less the emission strength declined by about a factor of ten ( lower plot in fig .  2 ) .",
    "the equivalent width over the next two days stayed at record low values relative to existing measurements @xcite . at the same time the emission in the wings of @xmath3 also disappeared revealing a broader photospheric line .",
    "@xcite obtained a spectrum six days after our last weak emission observation , and by that time the emission equivalent width was back to normal levels .",
    "we measured a projected rotational velocity for the weak emission spectra of @xmath26 km  s@xmath4 from a comparison of the width of @xmath3 with that in model profiles @xcite convolved with a rotational broadening function .",
    "this is close to the value obtained by @xcite , but we caution that this is probably only a lower limit since the profile ( like h@xmath0 ) is still probably affected by emission components even during this weak emission phase .",
    "it is hard to imagine any process that would change the density properties of the be star s disk so significantly in such a short time span .",
    "we suggest instead that the neutral hydrogen in the disk was almost totally ionized at that time by exposure to energetic radiation from the vicinity of the companion .",
    "we show in figure  3 the contemporary variations of the radio flux as observed with the nrao green bank interferometer @xcite , the daily averaged 5  12 kev x - ray flux observed with _",
    "rxte_/asm @xcite , and the h@xmath0 equivalent width .",
    "although there is no evidence of any x - ray flare at that time , a secondary radio brightening did occur about the time of the h@xmath0 decline .",
    "however , since the h@xmath0 strength appeared relatively normal during other radio bursts , it is not clear how or if this secondary maximum is related to the h@xmath0 weakening event . if the radio emission forms in the relativistic jets , then it is possible that the secondary radio maximum originated at positions further away from the orbital plane where the inner be star disk was more directly illuminated by jet emission .",
    "we note that the emission weakening event occurred near apastron , an orbital phase where @xcite also observed rapid variations in the h@xmath0 profile .",
    "we next turn to h@xmath0 variations related to the orbital period .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the variations in the relative strengths of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 peaks are least partially related to orbital phase ( see their fig .",
    "3 ) , and our results appear to support their conclusion .",
    "we show in the lower panel of figure  4 the ratio of the equivalent widths of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 fitted components ( table  1 ) plotted as a function of the orbital phase .",
    "we see that the @xmath22 peak appears to strengthen relative to the @xmath23 peak around periastron , @xmath27 .",
    "this strengthening of the short wavelength side of the profile also appears to shift the wing radial velocity to lower values .",
    "the top panel of figure  4 shows how the wing velocity attains a minimum near periastron with a velocity curve that is markedly different from the orbital one ( shown as a dotted line ) .",
    "the middle panel shows the average radial velocity of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 peaks that show no evidence of orbital motion .",
    "we compare in figure  5 the h@xmath0 equivalent width variations with orbital phase to those observed in the radio and x - ray fluxes .",
    "the lower panel shows our equivalent width measurements combined with 159 other published measurements @xcite",
    "that we have binned into ten phase groups ( after omitting the six unusually low measurements from the 1999 october decline ) .",
    "we see that when averaged over many cycles there appears to be a coherent cyclic variation in emission strength that attains a maximum near @xmath28 .",
    "a similar kind of variation is seen in the orbital phase binned x - ray fluxes from _",
    "rxte_/asm @xcite .",
    "the top panel of figure  5 shows the binned radio curve from the green bank interferometer .",
    "note that the radio brightenings from cycle to cycle show significant variation in the shape of the light curve and phase of maximum @xcite .",
    "finally we show in figure  6 these same three fluxes over the period of active observation .",
    "the top panel shows the green bank interferometer flux density observations at 2.25 ghz that we averaged by binning into time intervals equal to three orbital periods ( bins of 79.5  d ) , and the middle panel illustrates the _ rxte_/asm x - ray fluxes binned in the same way .",
    "the lower panel shows the individual h@xmath0 equivalent widths from our measurements ( _ plus signs _ ) and from other published measurements ( _ x signs _ ) .",
    "@xcite reported evidence of a long ( 1167  d ) periodicity in the radio measurements , and @xcite showed that a comparable timescale is found in the h@xmath0 properties .",
    "there are two maxima visible that are separated by about 1200  d in the h@xmath0 time series , but the coverage is too sparse to verify whether other cyclic maxima are present .",
    "the circumstellar disks of the bexrbs are comparable in many ways to those of other be stars , but their outer radii are probably limited by the gravitational influence of their compact companions @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that the maximum h@xmath0 emission equivalent widths ( a good measure of the maximum disk size ) are correlated with orbital period for the bexrbs .",
    "@xcite found that these limiting radii are defined by the closest approach of the companion in the high eccentricity systems and by resonances between the orbital period and the disk gas rotational periods in the low eccentricity systems .",
    "ls  i  + 61  303 has an orbital eccentricity that falls between these two cases , where the important resonance radii are comparable in size to the periastron separation .",
    "we can estimate the disk radius for ls  i  + 61  303 from the h@xmath0 equivalent width data shown in figure  6 .",
    "we recently presented numerical models of the circumstellar disks of be stars @xcite , and we demonstrated that there are monotonic relationships between the emission line equivalent width and the ratio of the angular half - width at half maximum emission of the projected disk major axis to the radius of the star .",
    "the relationship depends upon the temperature of the star , the inclination of the disk normal to the line of sight , and the adopted outer boundary for the disk radius .",
    "we assumed a primary star effective temperature of @xmath29  k appropriate to a b0  v classification @xcite , although we note that a lower temperature may be possible @xcite .",
    "figure  7 illustrates the relations for the inclination limits of @xmath30 and @xmath31 suggested by @xcite , and we use the mean of these cases in the radius estimations . note that @xcite argue that the inclination may be larger , and if so , then our radius estimates will be somewhat low .",
    "we adopted an outer boundary for the disk as the roche radius of the primary star at apastron .",
    "this assumption is not critical to the radius estimate since only weak , optically thin emission originates in the outer parts of the disk model .",
    "the mean h@xmath0 equivalent width from the data presented in figure  6 ( less the very low points from 1999 october ) is @xmath32   ( standard deviation ) , and from the relations shown in figure  7 the corresponding ratio of disk to stellar radius is @xmath33 .",
    "the expected disk truncation radius due to resonances with the orbital motion is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the integer number of disk gas rotational periods per one orbital period .",
    "@xcite predict that the @xmath36 truncation radius will dominate in moderate eccentricity systems , and assuming a stellar mass of @xmath37 @xcite and a radius of @xmath38 from the spectral classification @xcite , then the predicted @xmath36 truncation radius is @xmath39 .",
    "this agrees within errors with the estimate from the mean equivalent width given above , so that the observations are consistent with the idea that the disk radius is regulated by the @xmath36 resonance .",
    "note that @xcite suggest that the disk contributes about @xmath40 of the total continuum flux , so that the disk to stellar continuum flux ratio is @xmath41 in the optical .",
    "if so , then we need to rescale the equivalent width by a factor of @xmath42 in order to scale the h@xmath0 emission flux to the stellar flux alone .",
    "this leads to an estimated disk radius of @xmath43 ( see fig .",
    "7 ) , which is slightly larger than the @xmath36 truncation radius .",
    "the record of h@xmath0 emission measurements indicates that the disk may occasionally grow to an even larger radius .",
    "the two equivalent width maxima shown in figure  6 reach @xmath44  , and this value corresponds to a disk radius of @xmath45 ( for @xmath46 ) .",
    "the separation of the stars at periastron is given by @xmath47 and this is equal to @xmath48 for @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "thus , it appears that the times of the largest observed h@xmath0 emission correspond to epochs when the disk almost reaches the limiting radius set by the close passage of the companion at periastron .",
    "@xcite have made numerical hydrodynamical simulations of the be star s disk response to the gravitational influence of a compact companion in an elliptical orbit .",
    "they show that the tidal pulls at periastron lead to the development of a large spiral wave in the disk that can extend far beyond the truncation radius and out to the vicinity of the companion ( see their fig .",
    "furthermore , @xcite show that a similar spiral pattern can be induced in the accretion disk surrounding the companion in the times shortly after periastron and that the presence of the pattern can promote mass accretion .",
    "we speculate that processes like these are probably at work in ls  i  + 61  303 .",
    "the simulations show that the spiral wave starts at periastron as a density enhancement in the part of the disk facing the companion .",
    "the longitude of periastron is @xmath50 , so the portion of the disk facing the companion at periastron will have a negative radial velocity for our line of sight , and the fact that we observe an increase in the strength of the approaching @xmath22 peak of h@xmath0 at periastron ( fig .",
    "4 ) is consistent with the formation of a spiral wave enhancement then . as the spiral feature develops after periastron , disk gas",
    "would be carried outwards past the truncation radius , and the mass accretion processes would then begin in earnest .",
    "the geometrical extension of the disk after periastron associated with the spiral feature would probably increase the projected area on the sky of high h@xmath0 optical depth causing the emission feature to increase in strength as observed ( fig .",
    "our new determination of the time of periastron confirms that the x - ray and radio flux maxima occur some time after periastron @xcite .",
    "figure  5 shows that the x - ray flux attains a maximum near orbital phase @xmath51 while the radio maximum occurs later near @xmath52 .",
    "if the mass transfer process were instantaneous , we might expect that both fluxes would peak at periastron where the companion encounters the densest part of the disk .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite argue that if the process can be described by bondi - hoyle accretion then the mass accretion rate will also depend on the relative gas and accretor velocity and a second peak will occur later near apastron where the accretor s orbital velocity is slower .",
    "@xcite suggests that the first x - ray peak corresponds to the periastron accretion increase ( with a phase lag caused by inverse compton losses of relativistic electrons due to the large stellar flux field ) and that the second radio peak occurs near the slow motion apastron phase ( where compton losses are reduced because the stellar flux is weaker ) .",
    "if this radio flux peak arises from jets , then it is possible that ionizing radiation from the jets will lower the neutral h population and h@xmath0 emission ( leading to an h@xmath0 minimum near apastron ; see fig .  5 ) .",
    "we speculate that the ionizing flux may sometimes become quite strong ( perhaps from knots that develop in the jets ) and cause sudden decreases in h@xmath0 emission strength such as we observed in 1999 october ( fig .",
    "our study indicates that the extent and shape of the be star s disk has a significant influence on the mass transfer rate in this microquasar system .",
    "we show in the next paper in this series that similar limiting disk radii and spiral wave extensions are also found in the bexrb systems hde  245770 and x  per .",
    "we thank daryl willmarth and the staff of kpno for their assistance in making these observations possible .",
    "the x - ray results were provided by the asm / rxte teams at mit and at the rxte sof and gof at nasa s gsfc .",
    "the green bank interferometer is a facility of the national science foundation operated by the nrao in support of nasa high energy astrophysics programs .",
    "this work was supported by the national science foundation under grants ast0205297 , ast0506573 , and ast0606861 .",
    "institutional support has been provided from the gsu college of arts and sciences and from the research program enhancement fund of the board of regents of the university system of georgia , administered through the gsu office of the vice president for research .",
    "i  + 61  303 has a nearby visual companion that we also recorded in the spectra made in 2000 december .",
    "this companion star has a separation of @xmath53 and a position angle of @xmath54 from ls  i  + 61  303 according to coordinates listed in the guide star catalog ii ( where the companion is designated 0404701738 ) .",
    "the companion is approximately 3.5  mag fainter in the optical than ls  i  + 61  303 .",
    "our average spectrum shows a very broad h@xmath0 absorption line , no @xmath3 , a few weak metallic lines , and an interstellar line at 6613   that is identical in appearance to its counterpart in the spectrum of ls  i  + 61  303 . we compared the spectrum to several in the atlas by @xcite , and we tentatively classify the star as type a2  v. the radial velocity of the star from the h@xmath0 line is @xmath55 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "it is possible that this companion is an outlying member of the cas  ob6 association as is ls  i  + 61  303 @xcite .",
    "the companion s radial velocity is comparable to that of other association members @xcite including the nearby multiple star hd  16429 @xcite , and the similarity of the interstellar line strengths suggests a distance comparable to that of ls  i  + 61  303 .",
    "however , the companion also appears in the 2mass all - sky catalog of point sources @xcite ( with a designation of 2mass 02403208 + 6113340 ) , and the near - ir magnitudes suggest that the star is closer than cas  ob6 .",
    "suppose the absolute @xmath56-band magnitude for a a2  v star is @xmath57 @xcite and that the extinction is @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "then for the 2mass magnitude of @xmath59 , the estimated distance is @xmath60  kpc , which would place the star in the foreground of the cas  ob6 stars at a distance of 1.9  kpc @xcite .",
    "thus , unless the 2mass magnitudes and/or the spectroscopic estimate of absolute magnitude are wrong , this companion is probably a chance optical alignment rather than a neighbor of ls  i  + 61  303 .",
