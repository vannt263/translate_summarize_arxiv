    "one of the major discoveries of the first years of nucleus  nucleus collisions at rhic is the observed deficit in the production of high transverse momentum particles if compared to @xmath2 collisions  @xcite .",
    "the measurements strongly support the `` jet quenching '' interpretation , that high-@xmath0 partons traveling through the dense medium created in the collisions lose a significant fraction of their energy , through an enhanced radiation of gluons induced by the medium  @xcite , before they hadronize outside the medium .",
    "models based on this gluon radiation thus successfully account for the measured inclusive single - particle spectra and leading back - to - back two - particle correlations  @xcite .    despite these successes of models based on medium - induced radiative energy loss",
    " which assume either multiple soft - momentum transfers  @xcite or single hard scattering  @xcite from the medium  there is much room for technical improvements . in particular , standard formulations of parton energy loss",
    "consider only the medium - induced splitting of the leading parton , thus treating the splitting of leading and subleading partons differently .",
    "this makes it questionable to apply these approaches to the many measurements of jets and jet - like characteristics , such as particle - triggered multiplicity distributions , that are now gradually becoming available .",
    "also , the current state of the art in applying medium - modified parton splittings involves numerically significant ad hoc corrections to maintain energy - momentum conservation .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have proposed an alternative formulation of medium - induced parton energy loss . our approach is the first that treats both leading and subleading parton splittings on an equal footing .",
    "in addition , it conserves energy - momentum at each splitting .",
    "one of the main motivations for this approach is the possibility that these features may be more important than the precise treatment of coherence effects in medium - induced gluon emission , in particular for the discussion of high-@xmath0 particle correlations ( for which an interesting , alternative extension of parton energy loss was proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite ) and multiplicity distributions inside jets .",
    "jets in @xmath1 or @xmath2/@xmath3 collisions provide stringent tests of qcd . color coherence , which results in destructive interference between partons with small momentum fractions @xmath4 inside a shower , leads to unique predictions for the single inclusive distribution @xmath5 of partons inside a jet of energy and virtuality @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the interference is actually equivalent , to double and single logarithmic accuracy in @xmath7 and @xmath8 where @xmath9 is an infrared cutoff , to an angular - ordered probabilistic parton shower with leading - order splitting functions .",
    "the resummed modified leading logarithmic approximation ( mlla ) describes , to next - to - leading order @xmath10 , the measured longitudinal distributions of hadrons @xmath11 in collisions over a wide energy range  @xcite , provided each parton is mapped locally onto a hadron ( `` local parton ",
    "hadron duality '' , lphd ) with a proportionality factor @xmath12 . as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig : limitspectra ] shows the distribution @xmath11 inside 17.5  gev jets , a typical jet energy at rhic , measured in @xmath1 collisions by the tasso collaboration  @xcite , together with the mlla prediction .",
    "we have developed a formalism for medium - distorted jets which reduces to the mlla baseline in the absence of a medium  @xcite .",
    "with respect to the standard formalism of parton energy loss used currently in the analysis of rhic data , the approach involves different approximations .",
    "present model comparisons to rhic data start with a medium - modified energy distribution of gluons @xmath13 . here , the vacuum contribution is double logarithmic @xmath14 , and its integral over @xmath15 gives rise to the leading @xmath16 term in the dglap evolution equation .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath15-integration of @xmath17 is infrared- and ultraviolet - safe  @xcite , and leads to a geometrically enhanced ( @xmath18 ) `` higher twist '' contribution @xmath19 .",
    "however , these qualitatively different @xmath20-dependences do not enter current comparisons to rhic data .",
    "instead , one considers the @xmath15-integrated spectrum @xmath21 as an additional source of gluon radiation , whose dependence on @xmath20 is neglected .",
    "present approximations also do not include the further medium - induced splitting processes of subleading partons in the shower .",
    "one improvement of this state of the art may be to replace the double differential @xmath22 by @xmath23 in _ all _ leading and subleading splittings of a medium - modified parton shower .",
    "this requires a monte - carlo approach , which we intend to develop in future work . for the first analytical study , reported here , we have employed an additional approximation",
    ": we replaced the @xmath15-integrated medium distribution @xmath21 by a constant @xmath24 . in the kinematic regime tested at rhic ,",
    "this turns out to be a fair approximation .",
    "we have then used @xmath21 on the same level as @xmath25 , i.e. , as a leading logarithmic correction  @xcite . with this ansatz",
    ", our formalism ensures energy - momentum conservation at each parton splitting , and treats all leading and subleading parton splittings on the same footing .",
    "the price we pay for an analytical treatment is the inaccurate handling of the @xmath20-dependence ( which is not dealt with more properly in other formalisms ) and the approximate treatment of the @xmath26-dependence . in a monte - carlo formulation of the same problem",
    ", we expect to remove the latter deficiencies .",
    "moreover , the analytical results presented here will serve as a powerful consistency check for the correct implementation of splitting processes in the monte - carlo simulation .",
    "in our analytical approach , we approximate the medium - induced contribution @xmath21 by a constant @xmath24 in the kinematically relevant range of @xmath26 .",
    "medium - modified parton splitting functions then differ from the standard ones by multiplying their singular contributions with @xmath27 .",
    "this formulation allows us to follow the same line of technical arguments , used for the calculation of jet multiplicity distributions in the absence of a medium  @xcite .    ]    ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : limitspectra ] , one sees the resulting in - vacuum and medium - distorted distributions @xmath11 , plotted as a function of @xmath7 , for jets with @xmath28  gev .",
    "we chose the value @xmath29 to obtain in the same formalism a fair description of the suppression of high-@xmath0 hadrons  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : limitspectra ] illustrates the effect of the medium , which results in a depletion of the number of particles at large @xmath30 , and correspondingly a largely enhanced emission of particles at small @xmath30 : due to energy - momentum conservation in the parton shower , the energy which in the vacuum is taken by a single large-@xmath30 parton is redistributed over many small-@xmath30 partons in the presence of a medium .",
    "given the longitudinal multiplicity distribution inside a jet , a straightforward integration yields the number of particles inside the jet with momenta larger than a given cut , @xmath31 .",
    "we can then compute this multiplicity for jets with the same given energy both in the presence of medium effects ( in which case , the cut gives some control on the high - multiplicity soft background of heavy - ion collisions at rhic or lhc over which the jet develops ) and in vacuum , and form their ratio .",
    "the latter , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : assocmult ] for jets with @xmath32  gev and medium effects modeled by @xmath29 , is seen to be smaller than 1 for @xmath33  gev , while the medium - induced enhancement in soft particles becomes dominant for smaller values of the momentum cut . although the medium - enhanced part of the multiplicity is _ a priori _ buried in the soft background of au ",
    "au collisions at rhic , this crossover value lies close to that reported by the star collaboration in attempts at measuring the excess  @xcite .",
    "note , however , that in our calculation the jet energy is known and fixed , while experimentally it spans a rather wide range .",
    "we have reported a first step towards a description of parton showers in a medium , which conserves energy - momentum at each parton splitting , and deals in a symmetric way with all partons in the shower  @xcite .",
    "our simplified analytical formalism is able to reproduce at least semi - quantitatively several characteristic features of rhic data , such as the leading - hadron suppression and the enhanced soft - particle distribution associated to high-@xmath0 trigger particles . in the future ,",
    "a monte - carlo implementation of this approach may be of great interest , since it would allow one to include more realistic medium - induced splitting functions .",
    "also , it would allow us to address the issue whether and how medium - induced parton energy loss depends on virtuality .",
    "this question is of particular importance for addressing the logarithmically wide kinematic @xmath0 range accessible at the lhc .        for a review ,",
