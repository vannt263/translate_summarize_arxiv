    "the idea of inflation ( a period of rapid quasi - exponential expansion of the universe ) neatly solves several long - standing issues in cosmology @xcite , and has been spectacularly confirmed by observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies @xcite . while the universe is inflating , its contents is cold . but eventually , inflation has to end and the field driving the inflation must decay , depositing energy into high - energy particles .",
    "this process , known as reheating , `` boils '' the vacuum and starts the thermal history of the universe with the hot big bang . as universe continues to cool down , it could undergo more phase transitions , which would happen at symmetry breaking points of the theory .",
    "very little is known about the fundamental physics at these energy scales , and cosmological observations could be our only source of information for the foreseeable future .",
    "no photons reach us directly from this epoch as the universe is filled with hot plasma and is opaque until recombination .",
    "nevertheless , the expansion history of the early universe is imprinted on the sky in the form of primordial curvature fluctuations . with success of wmap and the data from planck",
    "soon to come , cmb observations are reaching precision required to disentangle other subdominant effects from gaussian fluctuations due to simple inflation @xcite .",
    "the most basic models of reheating involve inflaton decaying into one or more other scalar fields . among the most interesting are the ones where decay is non - perturbative , for example proceeding through parametric resonance naturally happening in chaotic inflation models @xcite , or tachyonic instability in hybrid inflation models @xcite . for all their simplicity ,",
    "these models have surprisingly rich physics involving non - equilibrium phase transitions . while initial stages of preheating are linear and instability development can be understood analytically @xcite , dynamics could be chaotic @xcite , and the field evolution quickly becomes inhomogeneous and non - linear , so non - perturbative decay of the inflaton has to be studied numerically @xcite . in this paper",
    "i briefly review the theory of parametric resonance , go over general results of numerical simulations of non - linear field evolution during preheating , and discuss signatures of preheating that could potentially be observed .",

    "the action describing two interacting scalar fields minimally coupled to gravity is @xmath7 with potential @xmath8 containing the terms responsible for field masses and self - couplings , as well as their interaction .",
    "polynomial field operators up to fourth order are renormalizable , so one usually takes @xmath9 or @xmath10 inflaton potential for chaotic inflation , and @xmath11 coupling term @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", one can keep the decay field @xmath6 massless .",
    "couplings like @xmath12 are also allowed and could be present @xcite , although one would need a @xmath13 self - interaction to keep the potential bounded from below .",
    "models with various combinations of these potential bits have been studied in the literature ; in this review , i will mainly focus on the one with quartic potential @xcite @xmath14 in a flat homogeneous isotropic universe with friedmann - robertson - walker metric @xmath15 the field equations of motion are readily obtained from the action ( [ eq : action ] ) ; they are @xmath16 @xmath17 hubble parameter @xmath18 plays the role of friction term in field dynamics .",
    "its value is determined by the ( average ) total energy density according to friedmann equation @xmath19 where the combined energy density of the two fields is @xmath20 during chaotic inflation , potential energy of the inflaton causes hubble friction to be large , and the motion of the fields is over - damped .",
    "the inflaton @xmath2 slowly rolls down the potential until the damping becomes sub - critical , at which point it starts oscillating near the minimum of the potential with decreasing amplitude , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : model]a . evolution of the hubble horizon size @xmath21 and the physical wavelength of comoving modes @xmath22 is shown on figure  [ fig : model]b . during inflation",
    "@xmath23 changes slowly , so that slow roll parameter @xmath24 .",
    "when field is oscillating , hubble horizon size grows as @xmath25 according to the average equation of state , which is @xmath26 for @xmath1 oscillator . comoving modes",

    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     while dynamics of the non - equilibrium phase transition can be rather varied , late stages of preheating appear to have a certain universality to them . after initial transient , the field evolution leads to a highly inhomogeneous state similar to that shown in figures  [ fig : rho]b and [ fig : strings]b which persists on long time scales , with slow fragmentation going on .",
    "a striking feature of this regime is that one - point probability distribution function of energy density contrast @xmath28 appears to be statistically stationary , and universal across a class of preheating models @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : universality ] shows late - time energy density pdfs ( with dilution due to expansion scaled out ) for four different preheating models ending via broad parametric resonance .",
    "all of them fit lognormal distribution @xmath29 \\frac{d\\rho}{\\rho}.\\ ] ] it is very tempting to attribute scaling and universality of the late stages of preheating to scalar field turbulence @xcite , especially since lognormal density distributions are known to arise in relativistic fluid turbulence @xcite , but the subject needs further investigation .",
    "as interesting as non - equilibrium field evolution could be , thermalization wipes out most of the details in the final state after the phase transition",
    ". however , dynamics of the transition could affect the expansion history of the universe , and leave an imprint in the observable large - scale curvature fluctuations produced during preheating @xcite .",
    "inflation transforms sub - horizon quantum vacuum fluctuations in all the light fields into super - horizon classical fluctuations .",
    "these fluctuations are statistically homogeneous and isotropic gaussian random fields , and are completely described by their spectra with amplitude @xmath30 evaluated at horizon crossing @xmath31 .",
    "causally disconnected patches on super - horizon scales evolve essentially independently , and large - scale curvature fluctuations @xmath32 are the difference @xmath33 in amount of expansion @xmath34 different patches experience from the constant curvature hypersurface at the end of inflation to the constant density ( and temperature ) hypersurface once thermalization occurred @xcite .",
    "fluctuations of the inflaton @xmath35 are usually the main source of metric curvature fluctuations @xmath32 , with their amplitude enhanced by the slow - roll parameter @xmath36 .",
    "it is also entirely possible to convert isocurvature modes from subdominant light fields into observable curvature perturbations , for example as it happens in curvaton - type scenarios @xcite and modulated reheating @xcite .",
    "resonant preheating dynamics can create and significantly amplify curvature fluctuations from isocurvature modes of light fields , as suggested by @xcite and calculated in @xcite .    for simple preheating model ( [ eq : v : l4g22 ] ) with small values of coupling @xmath37 ,",
    "the second field @xmath6 is light during inflation , and acquires fluctuation spectrum with power on super - horizon scales comparable to inflaton , as shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "super - horizon fluctuations of @xmath6 are converted to curvature fluctuations through preheating dynamics .",
    "the basic mechanism is that the flat @xmath6-direction of potential ( [ eq : v : l4g22 ] ) is suddenly lifted due to expectation value of inhomogeneous terms like @xmath38 when parametric resonance instability develops @xcite",
    ". this will modulate equation of state based on the value of homogeneous mode in field @xmath6 at a time inhomogeneity develops , and create curvature fluctuations dependent on initial value of @xmath6 on super - horizon scales .    calculating curvature fluctuations generated by preheating involves tracing minute differences in expansion history , from the end of inflation to thermalization , in non - linear three dimensional simulations of regions of the universe corresponding to different initial values of @xmath6 on super - horizon scales .",
    "this is a very demanding numerical problem , not only in terms of computing power , but precision required .",
    "the first attempt encountered numerical difficulties @xcite , and it required development of new numerical integration techniques to obtain the answer @xcite . skipping a lot of technical details which will be discussed elsewhere @xcite , the total curvature fluctuation @xmath32 produced in the inflation model ( [ eq : v : l4g22 ] ) is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the usual nearly gaussian contribution from inflaton fluctuations @xmath35 , and the second _ uncorrelated _ term",
    "is generated by preheating from the super - horizon mode of the field @xmath6 .",
    "the exact distribution of the field @xmath6 sampled on observable part of the sky depends on inflation history in extreme version of cosmic variance .",
    "the transfer function @xmath41 shown in figure  [ fig : fnl ] is quite non - linear and could lead to non - gaussian fluctuations of the form very different from the usual weak non - gaussianity parametrization @xmath42 the amplitude of curvature fluctuations produced by preheating in model ( [ eq : v : l4g22 ] ) is @xmath43 , which is comparable to the curvature fluctuations from inflaton , so the two could potentially be disentangled by searching for non - gaussian component in the observed cmb temperature anisotropy .",
    "very little is known about how inflation actually ended , and what was the high energy physics like at those energy scales ( or even what is the inflaton itself ) .",
    "traces of reheating are hidden from us by opaque plasma in nearly thermal state , and are unobservable directly .",
    "one must seek signatures of preheating that survive thermalization and could be detected .",
    "these could include stable relics like topological defects @xcite or primordial black holes @xcite , stochastic gravitational wave background produced by inhomogeneities during reheating @xcite , or anomalies in the expansion history of the universe imprinted in the primordial curvature fluctuations @xcite .",
    "of these , the last effect appears to be the most promising observationally , as stable relic formation is difficult without spoiling cosmology , and stochastic gravitational waves are very hard to detect .",
    "curiously enough , the simple model of preheating ( [ eq : v : l4g22 ] ) could generate non - gaussian curvature fluctuations of observable amplitude which are intermittent , producing primordial `` cold spots '' @xcite . although arguable @xcite , the cmb temperature map appears to have slight statistical anomalies in the form of a cold spot in the southern hemisphere @xcite , and slight discrepancy in north - south temperature anisotropy spectra @xcite .",
    "exciting possibility is that primordial `` cold spot '' , whether from preheating or some other early universe source , could potentially explain both . a tell - tale signature of _ primordial _ non - gaussian cold spot is the associated @xmath44-mode polarization pattern around it , which might be possible to test with planck data @xcite .",
    "primordial potential `` dips '' would also manifest in formation of large scale structure .",

    "<S> in this paper i review the theory and numerical simulations of non - linear dynamics of preheating , a stage of dynamical instability at the end of inflation during which the homogeneous inflaton explosively decays and deposits its energy into excitation of other matter fields . </S>",
    "<S> i focus on preheating in chaotic inflation models , which proceeds via broad parametric resonance . </S>",
    "<S> i describe a simple method to evaluate floquet exponents , calculating stability diagrams of mathieu and lame equations describing development of instability in @xmath0 and @xmath1 preheating models . </S>",
    "<S> i discuss basic numerical methods and issues , and present simulation results highlighting non - equilibrium transitions , topological defect formation , late - time universality , turbulent scaling and approach to thermalization . </S>",
    "<S> i explain how preheating can generate large - scale primordial ( non - gaussian ) curvature fluctuations manifest in cosmic microwave background anisotropy and large scale structure , and discuss potentially observable signatures of preheating .    </S>",
