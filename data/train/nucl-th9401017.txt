    "in last two decades , hypernuclear physics is remarkably developed both in theoretical and experimental aspects .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath4 experiments have been performed intensively and clarified properties of many hypernuclear states . however , such states are only a part of possible hypernuclear states . for example , ground states and deep - hole states of heavy hypernuclei are hardly excited in these experiments because of strong absorption of @xmath5 and @xmath6 in nuclear medium .",
    "unnatural parity states are also weakly excited because of the small spin - flip amplitudes .    as alternative tools to produce hypernuclei , photo- and electro - productions of hypernuclei ,",
    "that is , hypernuclear productions in the @xmath7 and @xmath2 reactions , are discussed .",
    "these reactions contain only particles which interact weakly with nuclear medium .",
    "therefore , these are favorable to produce directly hypernuclei with a deeply bound @xmath0 and/or a nucleon deep - hole .",
    "further , the dominant spin - flip amplitudes in these reactions are of great advantage to excite unnatural parity states of hypernuclei .    theoretical estimations@xcite-@xcite of photoproductions of hypernuclei have been performed by several authors . but",
    "the electroproductions@xcite were treated under rough approximations or only for the @xmath0-hypernuclei@xcite . in the present work , to improve such a situation , we give theoretical estimations of the electroproduction cross sections both for @xmath0 and @xmath1-hypernuclei . in spite of uncertainties in the elementary reactions , we treat the energy region corresponding to cebaf , which gives high possibility to the experiment in near future .",
    "our calculations are based on a relativistic impulse approximation and the walecka model of nuclei and hypernuclei .",
    "the elementary reactions are treated relativistically without any approximation within the model .",
    "parameters in the model are determined to reproduce known experimental data .    in  2 ,",
    "we give the model of elementary processes . in  3 , the relativistic model for nuclei and hypernuclei are explained . in  4 , the relativistic impulse approximation for hypernuclear production is formulated .",
    "numerical results are given in  5 .",
    "the results are compared with the quasifree hyperon production which is the largest background process in the experiments in  6 .",
    "conclusions of this work is given in  7 .",
    "theoretical models of processes including the strong interaction can not be determined uniquely",
    ". we can only pick up possible mechanisms and determine the parameters in the model so as to reproduce known empirical data .",
    "we assume that the processes @xmath9 consist of one - photon - exchange and @xmath10 vertex , as shown fig.1a .",
    "the former is theoretically undoubted because of the small qed coupling constant .",
    "the latter is complicated and is understood only insufficiently .    as a model of the @xmath10 vertex",
    ", we employ a sum of one - particle - exchange mechanisms as fig.1b .",
    "this model is commonly used in theoretical studies@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the coupling constants in the model are determined by fitting the experimental data . in the present work ,",
    "we use the values in refs.@xcite and @xcite , which are listed in table 1 and 2 for @xmath11 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that the model and the values of parameters have large uncertainties because of the limitation of experimental data .",
    "details of calculations with these parameters are given in refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "to check our computer code , we repeated their calculations . as a result",
    ", we obtained alomost the same results with those in the original works .",
    "only one exception is an oppsite assignment of lines in the fig.2 of ref.@xcite .    using the model",
    ", we calculate the elementary processes @xmath9 at around cebaf energies .",
    "as expected , we find vary large spin - flip amplitudes in all cases .    as a comparison , we can also use the approximate expression , @xmath12 which is used in ref.@xcite . in this expression , only on - shell @xmath10 amplitudes are assumed .",
    "but this gives different results from our exact calculations by around 20 - 40% .",
    "it should be noted that the present model give large cross sections for @xmath13 in comparison with those for @xmath14 by about one order of magnitude .",
    "therefore , the @xmath1 hypernuclear productions are sensitive to neutron wave functions in the target nucleus    cccc @xmath15 & @xmath16 & @xmath17 & @xmath18 + 2.57 & 1.52 & 0.105 & 0.064 +   +    lcccccc & @xmath19 & @xmath20 & @xmath17&@xmath18&@xmath21 & @xmath22 + ps & 2.20 & -4.82 & 0.113 & -0.038 & 0 & 0 + ps+delta & 2.72 & -3.60 & 0.104 & 0.005 & -0.069 & 0.314 +   +    .potentials for nucleon and calculated single particle energies for protons(in mev and fm ) [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in the experiments , quasifree hyperon productions are the largest background process for hypernuclear productions . to examine the feasibility of the experiments , we have to estimate this background process .",
    "quasifree hyperon production cross sections are given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the free elementary cross section , @xmath25 is so - called a quasifree response function and @xmath26 is a kinematical factor near 1 .    based on the picture of knockout processes from light nucleus , @xmath25 is given by @xmath27 where , @xmath28(@xmath29 ) is rest mass of initial target(final residual ) nucleus and @xmath30 is the nucleon momentum distribution in target nucleus .",
    "the region @xmath31 is defined by @xmath32    using this formalism , we obtain the result shown in fig.6 for the case of @xmath33he target .",
    "the result depends strongly on the widths of hypernuclei .",
    "if the hypothetical @xmath34h@xmath35 exists , we can observe clearly its signal .",
    "however , the signals of more possible states , for example , @xmath36_{j_{f}=2}$ ] states in @xmath37n and @xmath38b may be not so clear , because of their small cross sections(0.3 - 0.4 nb / sr@xmath39/gev ) , which correspond to about 10% of that for @xmath34h@xmath35(see filled peaks in fig.6 ) .    for @xmath0 hypernuclei",
    ", fig.6 shows that the electroproduction experiment is promising .",
    "we can expect to observe two or three unnatural parity states for in @xmath40n and @xmath41b .",
    "in the present work , we estimated the electroproduction of hypernuclei . we find large cross sections for the stretched states and unnatural parity states . for @xmath0 hypernuclei , they are a few nb / sr@xmath39/gev , which seems sufficiently measurable in spite of large backgrounds by the quasifree hyperon productions . for @xmath1 hypernuclei , we find the cross sections of several tenth of nb / sr@xmath39/gev for @xmath37n and @xmath38b .",
    "these signals may not be measured clearly in the experiments . in these calculations , however , all @xmath42-states of @xmath1 particle were assumed to be unbound .",
    "if the bound @xmath42-states exist , we get measurable cross sections(a few nb ) for the stretched states including such a @xmath42-state @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath34h@xmath35 with spin=1 , which is not bound theoretically@xcite-@xcite , exists , it can be clearly observed in the electroproduction experiments .",
