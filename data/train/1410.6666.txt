    "monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmdcs ) @xcite are truly two - dimensional ( 2d ) semiconductors @xcite , which hold great appeal for electronics and opto - electronics applications due to their direct band gap properties ( which contrast the indirect band gaps of three - dimensional layered crystals of tmdcs ) .",
    "monolayer tmdcs have already been implemented in field - effect transistors @xcite , logical devices @xcite , and lateral and tunnelling optoelectronic structures @xcite .",
    "like graphene , the group - ivb monolayer tmdcs of chemical composition mx@xmath5 ( where m = mo or w and x = s , se and te ) considered in this work have hexagonal lattice structures , and the extrema ( valleys ) in the dispersion relations of both the valence and conduction bands ( vb and cb ) can be found at the @xmath1 and @xmath6 points of the hexagonal brillouin zone ( bz ) . unlike graphene , however , these 2d crystals do not have inversion symmetry .",
    "the minimalistic approach to the theoretical modelling of monolayer tmdcs is therefore based on mimicking them as graphene with a staggered sublattice potential that breaks inversion symmetry @xcite .",
    "this approach captures certain optical and transport effects related to the valley degree of freedom of the electrons @xcite .",
    "the staggered graphene analogue @xcite has also been generalised to the tight - binding ( tb ) description of tmdcs @xcite , but this approach suffers from the large number of atomic orbitals that have to be included on each site and the need for beyond - nearest - neighbour hopping to account for the variation of the weight of individual atomic orbitals in the band wave functions across the bz , as revealed by detailed density functional theory ( dft ) modelling ( see , e.g. , figure [ fig : atomic - orbs ] ) .",
    "the accumulation of experimental data and the drive towards the implementation of monolayer tmdcs in practical devices call for theoretical models of their electronic properties that are both detailed and compact , containing a limited number of parameters while still offering an accurate description .    in this review ,",
    "we describe two complementary theoretical approaches that have recently been used to achieve a detailed description of the electronic properties of these materials .",
    "one consists of _ ab initio _ dft modelling of the band structure , which has the potential to be accurate .",
    "dft can be combined with transport codes @xcite or used to calculate optical spectra @xcite , but _",
    "ab initio _ calculations are prohibitively expensive for many practical problems focused on modelling devices and studies of , e.g. , quantum dots @xcite",
    ". moreover , magnetic - field effects @xcite and certain questions regarding neutral and charged excitons @xcite can not easily be addressed by dft - based techniques .",
    "the second approach uses the @xmath0 methodology @xcite , which exploits the symmetries of the system .",
    "this approach provides an accurate characterisation of the dispersion of the valence and conduction bands in the vicinity of , e.g. , the @xmath1 and @xmath6 points and other points of interest in the bz in terms of a relatively small number of parameters @xcite . magnetic - field and spin - orbit coupling effects can also be taken into account in a straightforward way @xcite .",
    "in contrast to dft modelling , this method is only valid in the vicinity of certain high - symmetry @xmath7-space points ; however , for those intervals , it enables one to quantify all the essential features of the electronic properties .",
    "one can also relate a @xmath0 hamiltonian to a particular tb model @xcite , although it is not necessary to set up a tb model in order to derive a @xmath0 hamiltonian . here",
    "we present phenomenological @xmath0 hamiltonians derived for all extrema of the bands ( at the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 points of the bz ) using the symmetry properties of tmdc atomic crystals , with specific material parameters obtained by fitting them to the dft band structures of mos@xmath5 , mose@xmath5 , mote@xmath5 , ws@xmath5 , wse@xmath5 and wte@xmath5 .",
    ", mose@xmath5 , ws@xmath5 and wse@xmath5 , while mote@xmath5 and wte@xmath5 have received much less attention .",
    "bulk mote@xmath5 with a trigonal prismatic coordination of the chalcogen atoms ( see figure [ fig : lattice](a ) ) exists below @xmath8c ( known as @xmath9-mote@xmath5 ) , whereas above @xmath10c the crystal structure is monoclinic and the material becomes metallic ( @xmath11-mote@xmath5 ) @xcite .",
    "monolayer samples using liquid exfoliation technique have been obtained from @xmath9-mote@xmath5 @xcite , and the optical properties of monolayer @xcite the transport properties of few - layer @xmath9-mote@xmath5 @xcite have been investigated recently , giving a clear motivation to include this material in our review .",
    "bulk wte@xmath5 has an orthorhombic crystal structure , where eight tellurium atoms surround the tungsten atom in a distorted octahedral coordination @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , one would expect that it may be possible to grow monolayer wte@xmath5 with hexagonal prismatic coordination on a suitable substrate . for completeness ,",
    "therefore , we include this material as well , assuming that its hexagonal structure is stable . ]",
    "the dft calculations discussed in this review were performed using the vasp @xcite and fleur @xcite codes .",
    "the robustness of our results is well illustrated by the close agreement between the results obtained from these two different first - principles codes and through comparison to all available experimental results .    finally , we note that the field of tmdcs , akin to that of graphene @xcite , has witnessed a large expansion over the last four years , encompassing both fundamental and more applications - oriented research directions . here",
    "we focus on a particular topic that we think will be important for the further development of this field . to limit the length of this review ,",
    "some fascinating topics related to , e.g. , the valley - dependent optical selection rule or the exciton physics are not discussed in detail here .",
    "we refer the interested reader to complementary reviews @xcite instead .",
    "this review is organised as follows .",
    "section [ sec : lattice - geom ] is devoted to the crystalline lattice parameters and vibrational properties of tmdcs .",
    "sections [ sec : definitions ] and [ sec : dvb ] discuss spin - splitting due to spin ",

    "second , we report effective masses and spin - splittings extracted from our dft calculations and compare them to experimental results , where available ; see tables [ tbl : k - dftparams - cb ] and [ tbl : k - dftparams - vb ] .",
    "one of the phenomena that first sparked strong interest in monolayer tmdcs was the pronounced effect of soc on the vb around the @xmath1 and @xmath6 points .",
    "soc leads to the spin - splitting and spin - polarization of the vb and the energy scale associated with soc is several hundreds of mevs : see table [ tbl : k - dftparams - vb ] .",
    "soc in the vb was first studied using dft calculations @xcite , but it can be readily understood using , e.g , a tight - binding model and first - order perturbation theory @xcite . an experimental signature of the spin - splitting of the vb is the energy difference of the a and b excitons @xcite .",
    "soc also affects the cb .",
    "this was initially neglected , mainly because in mos@xmath5 , which is the most widely studied of the tmdcs , it is indeed a small effect and it was assumed that the situation would be similar in other monolayer tmdcs . in general the magnitude of the spin - splitting of the cb is only 710% of that of the vb , with the exception of mos@xmath5 , where it is only @xmath124 : see table [ tbl : k - dftparams - cb ] .",
    "however , in absolute terms it is an energy scale that can be important at low temperatures and in ballistic samples .",
    "note that the soc in the cb at the @xmath1 point is a more subtle effect than in the vb . in the simplest theoretical approximation , which assumes that it is sufficient to consider only the @xmath125 atomic orbitals of the metal atoms",
    ", the soc vanishes .",
    "dft calculations , on the other hand , indicate that there is a finite spin - splitting in the cb at the @xmath1 point @xcite .",
    "as it turns out , the soc in the cb can be understood in terms of a competition between two contributions @xcite : i ) a first - order contribution from the chalcogen atoms , which have a small , but finite weight @xcite and ii ) a second - order contribution due to the coupling to other bands @xcite , where the @xmath126 and @xmath127 atomic orbitals have large weights ; see figure [ fig : atomic - orbs ] .",

    "can take place as a two - step process : first , the electron tunnels into a virtual state close to the @xmath3 point in the corresponding band , then it emits a bz - corner phonon to scatter into the final state near the band edge . the expected @xmath770@xmath771 characteristic therefore should have a tunnelling gap in the current of magnitude of the phonon energy , counted from the fermi level in a doped 2d semiconductor or the band edge in an undoped one .",
    "stm images of bulk mx@xmath772 can be simulated from first - principles . since in stm measurements",
    "one detects the tail of either the vb or cb wave function , depending on whether electrons or holes are injected into the material , one has to determine the decay rate of the wave function of the relevant states in different parts of the unit cell .",

    "the eigenvalues of the low - energy hamiltonian of equation read @xmath924\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath925 and similarly for @xmath926 , @xmath402 , @xmath927 ( @xmath928 ) are the relative phase of @xmath929 and @xmath415 ( @xmath930 and @xmath415 ) , and @xmath931 ( @xmath784 ) sign corresponds to the cb ( vb ) .",
    "since equation depends on the parameters @xmath415 , @xmath932 , @xmath933 , @xmath934 , and @xmath935 in a non - linear way , some care has to be taken in the fitting procedure .",
    "first , one can determine @xmath438 , @xmath932 , and @xmath933 in the following way . for small enough @xmath391 , the largest energy scale under the square root in equation is the band gap ( for a given spin @xmath30 ) @xmath936 .",
    "expanding the square root one finds @xmath937 in this approximation @xmath938 is described by a simple parabolic dispersion where the effective masses are given by @xmath939 since @xmath940 can be directly read off from the dft calculations and @xmath941 and @xmath942 can be obtained by fitting the cb and vb in the vicinity of the @xmath1 point with a parabola , equations  constitute four equations for five unknown parameters @xmath438 , @xmath932 , and @xmath933 . as explained in section [ subsec : k - point - params ] , the fitting around @xmath1 was done in a range that corresponds to @xmath142 of the @xmath3@xmath1 distance .",
    "the dispersion over this range can be considered to be isotropic and the difference in the effective masses along @xmath1@xmath3 and @xmath1@xmath4 can be neglected . over the same range in @xmath391",
    ", one can also fit the function @xmath943 to the cb and the function @xmath944 to the vb such that the fitting parameters @xmath945 and @xmath946 simultaneously give the best fit to the dispersion both in the cb and in the vb . comparing to equation",
    ", one can see that this corresponds to @xmath947 i.e. , we have obtained four more equations for @xmath438 , @xmath932 , and @xmath933 . using equations ",
    "one finds eight equations for the five unknown parameters @xmath438 , @xmath932 , and @xmath933 , which can be solved as a linear least - squares problem .",
    "the solution , however , depends on the value of the quasiparticle band gap @xmath948 used in the least - squares problem .",
    "as shown in table [ tbl : k - bandgap ] this is significantly underestimated in dft calculations .",
    "therefore we have performed the fitting using both the dft band gap and the @xmath325 gap .",
    "note that in order to find @xmath940 one has to add to the @xmath949 values shown in table [ tbl : k - bandgap ] the relevant spin - splitting energies , which can be found in tables [ tbl : k - dftparams - cb ] and [ tbl : k - dftparams - vb ] .",
    "the two approach lead to two sets of parameters . in both cases the _ same _ effective masses",
    "@xmath950 and @xmath951 , obtained from our dft calculations , were used .",
    "since the available experimental results suggest that dft can capture the effective masses quite well , at least in the vb ( see tables [ tbl : k - dftparams - vb ] and [ tbl : dft - at - g ] ) , we think that this is a reasonable approach to take into account the results of @xmath325 calculations .    finally the four remaining parameters @xmath934 and @xmath935 were determined in following way . similarly to the previous step , a function of the form @xmath952 was fitted to the vb and cb . here",
    "@xmath953 and @xmath954 were kept fixed at the values that were obtained at the previous step and the parameters @xmath955 and @xmath956 were required to give the best fit simultaneously to both the cb and the vb .",
    "the fitting was performed along the @xmath3@xmath1@xmath4 directions around @xmath1 and the fitting range corresponded to @xmath957 of the @xmath3@xmath1 distance .",
