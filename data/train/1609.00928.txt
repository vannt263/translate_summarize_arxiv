    "compared to perovskite manganites , which are well studied in light of multiferroicity , the microscopic physical properties of chromites are not explored in detail and the mechanism for multiferroicity in hocro@xmath0 is still under debate .",

    "although both lucro@xmath0 and ercro@xmath0 showed the presence of a polar state induced by magnetic ordering below @xmath12 , polarization was not affected by applied magnetic fields , so that the magnetoelectric coupling was not evident in these compounds .",

    "the role of the rare earth ion in determining the physical properties of chromites @xmath8cro@xmath0 was revealed in a recent communication where the origin of ferroelectricity in orthochromites has been attributed to the instability of the symmetric position of the rare earth ion  @xcite .",

    "proposed short - range magnetic exchange interactions could cause the off - center atomic motion leading to ferroelectricity . we will report a detailed nuclear and magnetic structure studies as a function of temperature elsewhere , which should shed more light on atomic displacements and short range magnetic order in hocro@xmath0 .        a typical inelastic spectrum measured at the time  of  flight instrument focus is presented in fig .  [ inelestic_hyperfine_crystalfield](c ) .",
    "the non - kramer s ho@xmath7 ions in hocro@xmath0 are at sites of point group symmetry @xmath197 ( c@xmath198 ) , which typically leads to a singlet ground state .",
    "thus the ground multiplet of the ho@xmath7 ion , @xmath199 , split into @xmath200 singlets by the crystalline field generated by surrounding ions .",
    "the energy range of our inelastic data , limited to only three crystal field levels , makes a crystal field calculation inadequate using a point ",
    "charge model .",
    "despite that , the observed inelastic peaks , fitted with gaussian peak functions as shown in fig .  [ inelestic_hyperfine_crystalfield](c ) , are centered at energies , @xmath201  mev , @xmath202  mev and @xmath203  mev are in excellent agreement with those determined from heat capacity data and reported values  @xcite .",
    "the hyperfine excitation signal which is masked gradually by quasielastic scattering upon increasing temperature , in contrast , the crystal electric field ( cef ) excitation signal is still visible in high temperature range .",
    "the temperature evolution of inelastic peak associated with the cef excitation between ground state ( @xmath204 ) and the second excitation level ( @xmath205 ) is presented in fig .",
    "[ figure6](a ) .",
    "the inelastic peak due to transitions between first excitation level ( @xmath165 ) and the second excitation level ( @xmath205 ) can also be seen ( above 10  k ) .",
    "two inelastic peaks were simultaneously fitted with gaussian peak function , both the peaks are well separated in all temperatures below 100  k above which the peak due to the transition between first excitation level ( @xmath165 ) and the second excitation level ( @xmath205 ) vanishes . the integrated peak intensity as a function of temperature for the peak corresponding to crystal field excitation @xmath205",
    "is plotted in fig .",
    "[ figure6](b ) .",
    "it exhibits a typical behavior of van vleck contribution below @xmath12 and a clear anomaly at @xmath12 = 140  k. given the fact that the cef interaction reflects directly the electrical and magnetic potential created by neighboring ions , the anomaly of peak intensity around @xmath12 indicated the change of local environment surrounding the ho@xmath7 ion in hocro@xmath0 . because both cr and ho moments order below @xmath12 , the anomaly on peak intensity can be mainly attributed to the effect of exchange field on the ho@xmath7 ion from the long range order of cr@xmath7 magnetic sublattice .",
    "et al_. ,  @xcite proposed that the multiferroicity in @xmath8cro@xmath0 is caused by the interaction between magnetic rare earth and weak ferromagnetic cr@xmath7 ions following the breaking of symmetry .",
    "the observed anomaly in cef signal strengthens the importance of ho - cr exchange striction .",
    "the anomaly in  [ figure6](b ) also implies the possible distortion of ho ions and their surroundings since the pyroelectric current exhibits its maximal at the same temperature  @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath205 peak position is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure6](c ) . in the temperature range 1.5  60  k ,",
    "the peak position remains unchanged at 10.1  mev and starts moving gradually to lower energy , above @xmath560  k , which is well below @xmath12 .",
    "the change of peak position of cef excitation at @xmath560  k hints at the shift of cef levels accompanied with the change of local crystallographic symmetry of ho@xmath7 ion .",
    "however , so far there is no report on the observation of structural distortion for hocro@xmath0 at 60  k. it is noticed that a tiny peak is observed at the same temperature in pyroelectric current curve , as shown in fig .",
    "5(a ) in the ref .  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the change of cef peak position at 60  k is related to the change of ferroelectric properties .",
    "a detailed study on the temperature  dependent crystal structure is needed to understand the unusual behavior of cef excitation and thus the mechanism of multiferroicity in hocro@xmath0 .",
    "high quality polycrystalline hocro@xmath0 was prepared by solid state reaction method and characterized by means of x - ray powder diffraction , heat capacity and inelastic neutron scattering measurements . from the structural analysis",
    "we could establish the consistency of the observed crystal structure and theoretical predictions based on goldschimdt s tolerance factor rule . from the low temperature nuclear contribution to the specific heat results we obtained the first cef excitation energy for ho@xmath7 , 1.379(5 )  mev and hyperfine field of 600(3 )  t with a hyperfine splitting energy , 22.5(2 )  @xmath1ev for @xmath68ho with @xmath108=@xmath206 .",
    "the entropy ( @xmath207 ) associated with nuclear hyperfine specific heat ( @xmath208 ) was also estimated from the low temperature specific heat , which is in excellent agreement with theory . the hyperfine splitting energy determined from specific heat data",
    "is then confirmed from the peak observed in inelastic back scattering data .",
    "the large linear term @xmath2  mjmol@xmath3k@xmath4 in the specific heat was understood as due to disordered ho@xmath7 spins , which is further supported by strong quasielastic scattering observed in inelastic backscattering data at high temperatures . from the analysis of high temperature specific heat , by fixing the first cef excitation level to 1.379(5 )  mev , obtained from low temperature specific heat analysis , we determined three more crystal field transitions at 10.37(4 )  mev , 15.49(9 )  mev and 23.44(8 )  mev .",
    "the lower energy crystal field levels observed from the inelastic neutron scattering measurements are in excellent agreement with those determined from specific heat data .",
    "the magnetic entropy ( @xmath209 ) associated with the magnetic specific heat ( @xmath144 ) is obtained , which is consistent with the theoretical prediction .",
    "the linear term in specific heat and also quasielastic scattering observed in inelastic neutron spectra , further adds another possible driving force for the observed ferroelectricity in the form of short range exchange interactions in this compound as proposed by wan _",
    "et al_. ,  @xcite .",
    "further , from the temperature evolution of crystal field spectra we confirm a direct correlation between the magnetic ordering and the ferroelectricity in this compound , as predicted by rajeswaran _",
    "et al_.  @xcite .",
    "in addition to aforementioned mechanisms , the asymmetry driven ferroelectricity as proposed by ghosh _ et al_.  @xcite and indra _ et al_. ,  @xcite should also be considered as one of the driving force for ferroelectricity .",
    "more detailed temperature dependent structural studies are required for the quantitative analysis of distortions induced ferroelectricity .",
    "thus our study and recent reports on the ferroelectricity confirm that hocro@xmath0 and @xmath8cro@xmath0 in general , possesses more than one ingredient which can drive ferroelectricity , suggesting that these materials are potential multiferroic candidates for device applications .",
    "our study warrants , more detailed temperature dependent nuclear and magnetic structure studies to establish a most favorable mechanism for multiferroicity in hocro@xmath0 and rare - earth orthochromites in general .",
