    "note that @xmath456 does not depend on @xmath59 , but it does depend on @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , we have that @xmath463 is completely determined by @xmath2 and @xmath3 , while the radius @xmath464 of the circles around @xmath95 is only restricted by the requirement that the mapping @xmath100 from ( [ deff ] ) is a conformal mapping on @xmath436 . with that in mind , it is clear that we may assume that the curve @xmath456 depends on @xmath2 and @xmath3 in a continuous way .",
    "now we can see what happens with the jump matrices in ( [ jumps1])([jumps6 ] ) as @xmath16 .",
    "on @xmath465 we have that @xmath211 is strictly positive .",
    "hence the jump matrix in ( [ jumps1 ] ) is @xmath466 as @xmath16 , uniformly on @xmath465 .",
    "this estimate is also valid uniformly for @xmath2 and @xmath3 in compact subsets of the set @xmath467 similarly , the jump matrices in ( [ jumps2])([jumps4 ] ) are @xmath466 as @xmath16 , uniformly on the respective contours and uniformly for @xmath2 and @xmath3 in compact subsets of ( [ abset ] ) .    for ( [ jumps5 ] ) and ( [ jumps6 ] ) we make use of the matching conditions @xmath468 and @xmath469 so that the jump matrices in ( [ jumps5 ] ) and ( [ jumps6 ] ) are @xmath470 as @xmath16 , uniformly on the two circles .",
    "a closer analysis also reveals that the @xmath239-terms in ( [ matching1 ] ) and ( [ matching2 ] ) are valid uniformly for @xmath2 and @xmath3 in compact subsets of ( [ abset ] ) .",
    "so the conclusion is that all jumps in ( [ jumps1])([jumps6 ] ) are @xmath470 uniformly for @xmath18 on @xmath456 , and uniformly for @xmath2 and @xmath3 in compact subsets of ( [ abset ] )",
    ". then arguments such as in @xcite lead to the following conclusion .",
    "we have that @xmath471 uniformly for @xmath472 and uniformly for @xmath2 and @xmath3 in compact subsets of the set ( [ abset ] ) .",
    "the estimate ( [ asymps ] ) is the basic asymptotic result . unravelling the sequence of transformations @xmath473",

    "so we have by ( [ relationc ] ) @xmath488 then using ( [ constants ] ) , ( [ sn11andsn12 ] ) , and ( [ relationc2 ] ) in ( [ y11formula2 ] ) , we obtain ( [ asformleft ] ) for @xmath18 in domain ii .",
    "for @xmath18 in domain iii away from the branch points , we obtain @xmath489 again we use ( [ constants ] ) , ( [ sn11andsn12 ] ) , and ( [ relationc2 ] ) to obtain ( [ asformmiddle1 ] ) from ( [ y11formula3 ] ) for @xmath18 in domain iii .",

    "however , we can not allow @xmath201 to be an integer , since then there is a reduction in the degree of @xmath491 and we can not normalize the jacobi polynomial to be monic .",

    "thus @xmath499    from ( [ defe ] ) we see that @xmath500 furthermore , we have @xmath501 for @xmath498 since @xmath18 is in domain vi , so that we use the formula ( [ defpsi1 ] ) to evaluate @xmath502 . taking into account that @xmath503 we have from ( [ defe2 ] ) and ( [ defpsi1 ] ) , @xmath504 plugging this into ( [ y11nearbranch ] ) we get @xmath505 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath506 .    comparing with ( [ constants ] ) and ( [ airycombination ] ) we see that @xmath507 thus @xmath508          \\frac{s^{1/4}}{a(z ) } { { \\mathcal a}}(s ) - \\frac{a(z)}{s^{1/4 } } { { \\mathcal a}}'(s )          \\end{pmatrix}\\ ] ] we derived the formula ( [ asymplocal ] ) for @xmath492 in the domain vi .",
    "similar calculations for @xmath492 in the other domains give the same result , so ( [ asymplocal ] ) is valid in the full neighborhood @xmath436 of @xmath88 .",
    "now it remains to recall that @xmath509 and that @xmath510 as @xmath16 in order to obtain ( [ asformnearzeta- ] ) .",
