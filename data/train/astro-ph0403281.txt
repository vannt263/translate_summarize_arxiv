    "wx  cen was initially identified by @xcite as a possible optical counterpart of the hard x - ray transient source cen xr-2 , although this identification was latter discarded .",
    "because of its spectral characteristics , the object was then classified as a wolf - rayet star of type wn 7 @xcite , while @xcite classified it as a nova - like variable .",
    "ds95  showed that it is a binary system with an orbital period of 10.0 hr .",
    "the photometric orbital variation , determined by these authors , based on their spectroscopic observations , is approximately sinusoidal with an amplitude of @xmath16 mag . in spite of the period being relatively long ( in the context of cataclysmic variables ) it was not possible to identify any spectral signature of the secondary star .",
    "a distance of 1400 pc was determined from the na i d line equivalent width , and an @xmath17 was suggested from the average of three distinct determinations ( 4430 dib and na i d equivalent widths and he ii 4686 , 10124  lines ratio ) .",
    "doppler tomography of wx  cen produced by ds95 suggests that the gas of the secondary has normal chemical abundance , while the wind of the primary star is probably over - abundant in helium ( he@xmath18/h = 0.56 ) .",
    "ds95 also showed that , if the primary component of wx  cen is a white dwarf , then the secondary should have a mass bellow @xmath19 and , therefore , be evolved . if , however , one assumes the hypothesis that the secondary is a main sequence star , it would have @xmath20 , and the primary , a mass of @xmath21 .",
    "@xcite included wx  cen in a group of 4 galactic binaries defined as the v  sge stars .",
    "the other three objects are v  sge @xcite , v617  sgr @xcite and di  cru @xcite .",
    "they are characterized by the presence of strong emission lines of o vi and n v. besides , he ii is at least two times more intense than h@xmath22 .",
    "the v  sge stars are similar to the compact binary supersoft sources ( cbss ) , seen in the magellanic clouds , but not that frequent in the galaxy .",
    "cbsss are interpreted as suffering hydrostatic hydrogen nuclear burning on the surface of a white dwarf .",
    "this burning is due to the high mass - transfer rate , a consequence of the fact that the systems have inverted mass ratios ( see @xcite for a revision and references ) . @xcite also considered the hypothesis of galactic cbss nature for the stars v sge , t pyx and wx cen , established on their extremely blue colors , high luminosities , orbital light curves and highly excited emission line spectra .    in an observational program to search for galactic wr stars",
    ", @xcite rediscovered wx  cen as a new wn3 , when this star received the wr  48c designation . in our search for v  sge type stars",
    ", we selected wr  48c as a candidate , on the basis of spectroscopic criteria , for a detailed observational study .",
    "we , then , realized that wr  48c was the already known star wx  cen .",
    ", width=317 ]    , width=317 ]",
    "we observed wx  cen photometrically for 9 nights on 2000 april and 2003 may and july with the boller & chivens 60  cm and zeiss 60  cm telescopes at the pico dos dias observatory  mct / lna  located in brazpolis , southeast brazil ( see table  [ jophoto ] ) .",
    "a thin back - illuminated eev ccd 002 - 06 chip and a wright instruments",
    "thermo - electrically cooled camera were employed to obtain the images .",
    "the timing was provided by a global positioning system ( gps ) receiver .",
    "the frames were obtained through the johnson @xmath23 filter , with exposure times of 40 , 50 and 80 seconds .",
    "we also observed this star in white light with 2 seconds exposure time , for which we used the same ccd , operated in the frame transfer mode , resulting in dead time between integrations of the order of milliseconds .",
    "bias and flatfield exposures were obtained for correction of the stellar images .",
    "the images , except the ones obtained in frame transfer mode , present an overscan region used for the ccd s zero point correction .",
    "the data reduction was performed with the standard procedures , using iraf   routines .",
    "the star is located in a quite rich field ; we , therefore , carried out differential psf ( point spread function ) photometry of wx  cen and four comparison stars of the field using the lcurve package , written and kindly provided by m.p .",
    "it makes use of daophot routines to treat automatically long time series data .",
