    "erds noticed @xcite that any graph @xmath3 with minimum degree @xmath4 at least @xmath5 contains a spanning , bipartite subgraph @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "the proof for this fact is obtained by taking a maximal edge - cut , a partition of @xmath8 into two sets @xmath9 and @xmath10 , such that the number of edges with one endpoint in @xmath9 and one in @xmath10 , denoted @xmath11 , is maximal .",
    "observe that if some vertex @xmath12 in @xmath9 does not have degree at least @xmath1 in @xmath13 $ ] , then by moving @xmath12 to @xmath10 , one would increase @xmath11 , contrary to maximality .",
    "the same argument holds for vertices in @xmath10 .",
    "in fact this proves that for each vertex @xmath14 , by taking such a subgraph @xmath6 , the degree of @xmath12 in @xmath6 , denoted @xmath15 , is at least @xmath16 .",
    "this will be used throughout the paper .",
    "thomassen observed that the same proof shows the following stronger statement .",
    "given a graph @xmath3 which is at least @xmath17 _ edge - connected _ ( that is one must remove at least @xmath5 edges in order to disconnect the graph ) , then @xmath3 contains a bipartite subgraph @xmath6 for which @xmath6 is @xmath1 edge - connected .",
    "in fact , each edge - cut keeps at least half of its edges .",
    "this observation led thomassen to conjecture that a similar phenomena also holds for _ vertex - connectivity_.    before proceeding to the statement of thomassen s conjecture , we remind the reader that a graph @xmath3 is said to be @xmath1 _ vertex - connected _ or @xmath1-_connected _ if one must remove at least @xmath1 vertices from @xmath8 in order to disconnect the graph ( or to remain with one single vertex ) .",
    "we also let @xmath18 denote the minimum integer @xmath1 for which @xmath3 is @xmath1-connected . roughly speaking",
    ", thomassen conjectured that any graph with high enough connectivity also should contain a @xmath1-connected spanning , bipartite subgraph .",
    "the following appears as conjecture 7 in @xcite .",
    "[ conj7 ] for all @xmath1 , there exists a function @xmath0 such that for all graphs @xmath3 , if @xmath19 , then there exists a spanning , bipartite @xmath20 such that @xmath21 .    in this paper",
    "we prove that conjecture [ conj7 ] holds up to a @xmath2 factor by showing the following :    [ thm : graph ] for all @xmath1 and @xmath22 , and for every graph @xmath3 on @xmath22 vertices the following holds . if @xmath23 , then there exists a spanning , bipartite subgraph @xmath20 such that @xmath21 .",
    "because of the @xmath2 factor , we did not try to optimize the dependency on @xmath1 in theorem [ thm : graph ] .",
    "however , it looks like our proof could be modified to give slightly better bounds .",
    "in this section , we introduce a number of preliminary results .",
    "the first tool is the following useful theorem due to mader @xcite .",
    "[ mader ] every graph of average degree at least @xmath24 has an @xmath25-connected subgraph .",
    "because we are interested in finding bipartite subgraphs with high connectivity , the following corollary will be helpful .",
    "[ cor : maderbipartite ] every graph @xmath3 with average degree at least @xmath26 contains a ( not necessarily spanning ) bipartite subgraph @xmath6 which is at least @xmath25-connected .",
    "let @xmath3 be such a graph and let @xmath27 be a partition of @xmath8 such that @xmath11 is maximal .",
    "observe that @xmath28 , and therefore , the bipartite graph @xmath29 with parts @xmath9 and @xmath10 has average degree at least @xmath24 .",
    "now , by applying theorem [ mader ] to @xmath29 we obtain the desired subgraph @xmath6 .",
    "we will also make use of the following easy expansion lemma .",
    "[ lemma : joining two k connected graphs ] let @xmath30 and @xmath31 be two vertex - disjoint graphs , each of which is @xmath1-connected .",
    "let @xmath6 be a graph obtained by adding @xmath1 independent edges between these two graphs .",
    "then , @xmath32 .",
    "note first that by construction , one can not remove all the edges between @xmath30 and @xmath31 by deleting fewer than @xmath1 vertices .",
    "moreover , because @xmath30 and @xmath31 are both @xmath1-connected , each will remain connected after deleting less than @xmath1 vertices . from here",
    ", the proof follows easily .",
    "next we will show how to merge a collection of a few @xmath1-connected components and single vertices into one @xmath1-connected component . before stating the next lemma formally , we will need to introduce some notation .",
    "let @xmath33 be @xmath34 vertex - disjoint @xmath1-connected graphs , let @xmath35 be a set consisting of @xmath36 vertices which are disjoint to @xmath37 for @xmath38 , and let @xmath39 be a @xmath1-connected graph on the vertex set @xmath40 .",
    "also let @xmath41 be a @xmath42-tuple and @xmath43 denote the @xmath44th element of @xmath45 .",
    "finally , let @xmath46 denote the family consisting of all graphs @xmath3 which satisfy the following :    1 .",
    "the disjoint union of the elements of @xmath45 is a spanning subgraph of @xmath3 , and 2 .   for every distinct @xmath47 if @xmath48 , then there exists an edge in @xmath3 between @xmath43 and @xmath49 , and 3 .   for every @xmath50",

    "let @xmath60 be two distinct vertices in @xmath29 ; we show that there exists a path in @xmath29 connecting @xmath61 to @xmath62 . towards this end , we first note that if both @xmath61 and @xmath62 are in the same @xmath63 , then because each @xmath63 is @xmath1-connected",
    ", there is nothing to prove .",
    "moreover , if both @xmath61 and @xmath62 are in distinct elements of @xmath45 which are also disjoint from @xmath64 , then we are also finished , as follows . because @xmath39 is @xmath1-connected ,",
    "if we delete all of the vertices in @xmath39 corresponding to elements of @xmath45 which intersect @xmath64 , the resulting graph is still connected .",
    "therefore , one can easily find a path between the elements containing @xmath61 and @xmath62 which goes only through `` untouched '' elements of @xmath45 , and hence , there exists a path connecting @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the remaining case to deal with is when @xmath61 and @xmath62 are in different elements of @xmath45 , and at least one of them is not disjoint with @xmath64 .",
    "assume @xmath61 is in some such @xmath43 ( @xmath62 will be treated similarly ) .",
    "using property @xmath65 of @xmath66 , there is at least one edge between @xmath43 and an untouched @xmath49 . therefore one can find a path between @xmath61 and some vertex @xmath67 in an untouched @xmath49",
    "this takes us back to the previous case .      a _ directed graph _ or",
    "_ digraph _ is a set of vertices and a collection of directed edges ; note that bidirectional edges are allowed . for a directed graph @xmath68 and a vertex @xmath69 we let @xmath70 denote the out - degree of @xmath12 .",
    "we let @xmath71 denote the _ underlying graph of _ @xmath68 , that is the graph obtained by ignoring the directions in @xmath68 and merging multiple edges . in order to find the desired spanning ,",
    "bipartite @xmath1-connected subgraph in theorem [ thm : graph ] , we look at sub - digraphs in an auxiliary digraph .",
    "the following is our main technical lemma and is the main reason why we have a @xmath2 factor .",
    "[ lem : main ] if @xmath68 is a finite digraph on at most @xmath22 vertices with minimum out - degree @xmath72 then there exists a sub - digraph @xmath73 such that    1 .   for all @xmath74 we have @xmath75 , and 2 .",
    "@xmath76 .    if @xmath77 , then there clearly is nothing to prove .",
    "so we may assume that @xmath78 .",

    "the smallest component , say @xmath79 , has size at most @xmath80 and for any @xmath81 , every out - neighbor of @xmath12 is either in @xmath82 or in the separating set that we removed , and so @xmath83    we continue by repeatedly applying this step , and note that this process must terminate .",
    "otherwise , after at most @xmath2 steps we are left with a component which consists of one single vertex and yet contains at least one edge , a contradiction .",
    "with the preliminaries out of the way , we are now ready to prove theorem [ thm : graph ] .",
    "as long as @xmath63 contains a bipartite subgraph which is at least @xmath1-connected on at least @xmath86 vertices , let @xmath87 be such a subgraph of maximum size , and let @xmath88 .",

    "therefore , the graph obtained by joining @xmath93 to @xmath101 with this set of at least @xmath1 edges is a @xmath1-connected ( by lemma [ lemma : joining two k connected graphs ] ) , bipartite graph and is larger than @xmath93 , contrary to the maximality of @xmath93 .    for showing @xmath111 ,",
    "note that if there are at least @xmath105 between @xmath12 and @xmath93 then there are at least @xmath1 edges incident with @xmath12 touch the same part of @xmath93 , and let @xmath112 be a set of @xmath1 such edges .",
    "second , we mention that joining a vertex of degree at least @xmath1 to a @xmath1-connected graph trivially yields a @xmath1-connected graph",
    ". next , since all the edges in @xmath112 are touching the same part , the graph obtained by adding @xmath12 to @xmath113 and @xmath112 to @xmath114 , will also be bipartite .",
    "this contradicts the maximality of @xmath93 .    for @xmath115 , note first that since @xmath30 is not spanning , using @xmath111 we conclude that in the construction of the bipartite subgraphs @xmath92 in the process above , @xmath116 therefore , using corollary [ cor : maderbipartite ] , it follows that @xmath117 contains a bipartite subgraph of size at least @xmath91 which is also @xmath1-connected .",
    "therefore , the process does not terminate at this point , and @xmath31 exists ( that is , @xmath118 ) .",
    "it also follows that for each @xmath106 we have @xmath119 .",

    ", one can separate what is left from @xmath93 and its complement , contrary to the fact that @xmath3 is @xmath98 connected .    in order to complete the proof",
