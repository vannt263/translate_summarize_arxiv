    "wetting transitions can be considered as an interface unbinding transition where the mean interfacial separation from a substrate plays the role of an order - parameter . in the wet state",
    "the interface drifts away from the substrate , while in the nonwet state the interface is bound to it , with many contact points between them . in equilibrium ,",
    "such phenomena can be described by langevin - type equations of the form @xcite",
    "@xmath0    with @xmath1 standing for the energy between the substrate and the interface , @xmath2 being a gaussian white noise , and @xmath3 a diffusion coefficient .",
    "alternatively , the number of contact points between the substrate and the interface can also be regarded as an order - parameter that equals zero when @xmath4 and is nonzero otherwise .",
    "this quantity is closely related to the surface order - parameters studied in the framework of lattice systems in a semi - infinite geometry , for which the interfacial displacement models like eq .",
    "( [ ew_wall ] ) are expected to be useful effective descriptions @xcite .",
    "a familiar example is provided by ising ferromagnets where the surface order - parameter is the average magnetization at the substrate .",
    "the variable @xmath5 constitutes an adequate mathematical representation of such an order - parameter that exhibits singular behavior : it is a positive quantity that vanishes as @xmath6 close to criticality , with @xmath7 denoting a convenient control parameter , and evolves in time as @xmath8 right at the transition .",
    "an extension to nonequilibrium situations was considered by adding the nonlinear term @xmath9 to eq .",
    "( [ ew_wall ] ) , which represents preferential growth along the local normal to the surface and covers the realm of kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) interfacial phenomena @xcite .",
    "this is expected to capture the physics of wetting transitions under nonequilibrium circumstances in the simplest possible form .",
    "interestingly , in this case a simple langevin equation for @xmath10 does exist if short - ranged forces between the substrate and the interface are assumed .",
    "one typically writes @xcite , @xmath11\\ ] ] where @xmath7 and @xmath12 are phenomenological parameters .",
    "the change of variables @xmath13 leads to an equation of the form ( see @xcite for details ) ,    @xmath14    to be interpreted in the stratonovich sense . here",
    ", @xmath12 is a temperature dependent - parameter , @xmath7 plays the role of a chemical potential difference and is the control parameter , and @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 carries the opposite sign of @xmath18 which is the ultimate responsible for the physical behavior . for @xmath19 ,",
    "the above equation represents the so called _ multiplicative noise 1 _",
    "( mn1 ) universality class @xcite . for @xmath20",
    ", @xmath10 is merely an auxiliary variable that diverges at the transition and it is @xmath21 which has to be studied instead . in this case the associated set of exponents define the _ multiplicative noise 2 _ (",
    "mn2 ) universality class @xcite .",
    "a detailed discussion of the differences between the mn1 and mn2 universality classes can be found in @xcite . in the following discussion",
    "the surface order - parameter will be denoted @xmath22 .",
    "it should be emphasized that @xmath23 for mn1 and @xmath24 for mn2 . despite the simple appearance of eq .",
    "( [ mn ] ) , we nonetheless caution that the intricacies and subtleties of the kpz equation lie in the interplay between the diffusion and the multiplicative gaussian white noise terms .",
    "the mn1 and mn2 universality classes are examples of nonequilibrium , complete wetting transitions , in which @xmath7 has to be fine tuned .",
    "a second type of wetting transitions may occur if as the temperature is increased @xmath12 becomes bigger and eventually changes its sign while the system is kept at coexistence , @xmath25 .",
    "this is denoted _ critical wetting _ and amounts to taking @xmath26 and adding a higher - order term @xmath27 in order to obtain a finite solution for @xmath10 .",
    "equivalently , the potential to be considered in the interfacial representation is @xmath28 , where the last term ensures stability .",
    "more precisely , the model system is defined by the langevin equation    @xmath29    in which now @xmath12 is the new control parameter and @xmath7 is set to the critical value @xmath30 found for the complete wetting transition . for sufficiently low values of @xmath26 the interface remains pinned and the density of locally pinned sites at the wall is high .",
    "as the transition is approached ( increasing @xmath12 ) , the stationary density of pinned segments goes to zero in a continuous manner as @xmath31 . above @xmath32 , the interface depins and",
    "therefore the mean separation @xmath33 diverges and @xmath34 vanishes . in this latter case",
    "the density of pinned segments scales with time as @xmath35 , with the exponent @xmath36 adopting different values for mn1 ( @xmath19 ) and mn2 ( @xmath20 ) .    in this paper",
    "we study within the mean - field approximation the critical wetting transition associated with eq .",
    "( [ critical_mn ] ) . in the absence of exact solutions , mean - field approaches",
    "are useful not only in enabling analytic calculations to be performed , but also because they provide insight into the physical behavior at high system dimensionalities which would be otherwise unattainable from computer simulations alone .",
    "since , in the present case , it is known that mean - field theory could be valid for dimensions as low as @xmath37 ( @xmath38 bulk dimensions ) at least in some regime , the results presented here may be relevant for realistic three - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the mean - field approach and provide details of the calculation for both the mn1 and mn2 cases .",
    "as will be proved , three different scaling regimes have to be distinguished for mn1 , and only one for mn2 .",
    "results for higher moments of @xmath39 and for @xmath33 are also included .",
    "section iii contains a summary and a discussion of our findings .",
    "sound mean - field approximations to multiplicative - noise equations like ( [ critical_mn ] ) require that the effects of both the noise and of the spatially varying order - parameter are taken into account to some extent . to this effect , the following procedure can be used @xcite : the laplacian is discretized as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and the sum is over the nearest - neighbors of @xmath42 .",
    "afterward , the value of the nearest - neighbor is substituted by the average field @xmath43 to obtain a closed fokker - planck equation for @xmath44 .",
    "the steady - state solution is then found from the self - consistency requirement @xcite    @xmath45    in what follows we particularize eq .",
    "( [ self - cons ] ) to the mn1 and mn2 cases [ see eq .",
    "( [ critical_mn ] ) ] .",
    "it will be shown that for mn1 there is a sequence of scaling regimes depending on the relative importance of the noise strength as compared to the spatial coupling @xmath3 and the nonlinearity exponent @xmath17 : ( i ) a pure mean - field regime where the noise can be completely disregarded , ( ii ) a weak - noise regime where the noise strength enters the expression of the exponents , but without shifting the wetting temperature , and ( iii ) a strong noise regime where both the wetting temperature and the exponents are noise dependent .",
    "for mn2 the situation is far less rich , exhibiting a single mean - field - like scaling regime .    in the following analysis",
    "the mean - value theorem for infinite integrals @xcite will be used repeatedly to determine the asymptotic behavior in @xmath46 of the various integrals . according to this theorem , under quite general integrability and boundedness conditions ,    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is some value between the lower and upper bounds of @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "likewise , the combination @xmath50 will be denoted by @xmath51 to simplify the notation .      for the mn1 case ( @xmath19 )",
    ", the associated stationary probability density can be readily obtained from the associated associated fokker - planck equation @xcite and reads    @xmath52    where @xmath53 , and @xmath54 . after defining    @xmath55    and substituting @xmath56 , @xmath57 , with    @xmath58    the self - consistency equation ( [ self - cons ] )",
    "can now be recast in the simpler form    @xmath59    since the mean - field , self - consistent calculation for complete wetting ( mn1 ) @xcite yields @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) and @xmath62 does not diverge , the condition ( [ consistency ] ) simplifies to @xmath63 .",
    "we now consider an intermediate point @xmath64 such that @xmath65 and split @xmath66 as    @xmath67    after which @xmath68 $ ] in @xmath69 is expanded to second order , whereupon    @xmath70   % e^{-1/x }   \\nonumber \\\\ c_1-b'c_2m^p - c_3m^{2p } + o(m^{3p}),\\ ] ]    where @xmath71 , and @xmath72 are constants . as for @xmath73 , since the derivative can enter the integral , @xmath74 with @xmath75 being a by - product of the application of the mean - value theorem .",
    "taking @xmath76 ,    @xmath77    finally , @xmath78 to proceed further requires identifying the term involving the lowest power of @xmath79 , which in turn requires studying how @xmath80 modifies @xmath81 for small values of @xmath79 .",
    "first , notice that the factor @xmath82 is innocuous in such a limit .",
    "second , we work out the low-@xmath79 limit of the two integrals contained in @xmath80 , namely ,    @xmath83    to find after splitting ,    @xmath84    after applying the mean - value theorem to the first integral a contribution @xmath85 is obtained ( the second integral contributes a constant ) , whence it ensues that the leading asymptotic behavior of eq .",
    "( [ complete ] ) is unaffected by @xmath80 and hence two cases must be distinguished .",
    "_ case 1 : _",
    "@xmath86 leads to an equation of the form ( @xmath87,@xmath88 , and @xmath89 being positive factors ) @xmath90 which implies @xmath91 as @xmath92 , with @xmath93    _ case 2 : _ @xmath94 .",
    "it is expedient to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ dj2 dm ] ) as    @xmath95    the first integral , which we call @xmath96 , does not depend on @xmath79 but can vanish for particular values of @xmath12 , while the for the second one we again apply the mean - value theorem to obtain the leading ( lowest ) powers @xmath97 , @xmath98 when @xmath99 .",
    "last ,    @xmath100    note that the factors @xmath101 and @xmath102 are given in terms of exponentials of @xmath103,@xmath104 $ ] which result from the application of the mean - value theorem , and do not vanish as @xmath105 .",
    "the next step is to find out what values of @xmath12 make @xmath96 vanish .",
    "the latter consists of two integrals that can be easily written in terms of parabolic - cylinder functions @xmath106 , using the recurrence relation @xmath107 @xcite :    @xmath108    therefore , the critical point is determined by the zeros of the parabolic - cylinder functions .",
    "it turns out that @xmath109 has exactly one zero of order one on the interval at hand @xcite , @xmath110 , and that this zero is negative , so we thus conclude that in this regime the transition occurs at the finite value @xmath111 , with @xmath112 the only zero of @xmath113 , and is controlled by an exponent @xmath114 , where now @xmath115 .",
    "we next summarize the scaling regimes obtained for the three cases :    @xmath116    in order to check these results we have solved numerically the self - consistent equation ( [ self - cons ] ) .",
    "this requires evaluating numerically the involved integrals .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the output of this calculation by showing estimates of @xmath117 as a function of @xmath17 and @xmath50 .",
    "note the excellent agreement with the analytical results eq.([cases ] ) . in the region around @xmath118 , there are divergences and the integrals are difficult to evaluate numerically , generating large error bars . for ratios @xmath119 larger than @xmath120",
    "the location of the critical point obtained by solving ( [ self - cons ] ) numerically is find to coincide with that given by the zeros of the corresponding parabolic - cylinder function , which we have also computed numerically .",
    "these results provide a complete verification of the previous analytical calculations .",
    "let us now consider higher - order moments .",
    "we can write for @xmath121 @xmath122 with @xmath123 where @xmath124 splitting the integral into two parts as above , @xmath125 , @xmath126 proceeding similarly as in the above cases for @xmath69 and @xmath73 , the lowest powers in @xmath79 can be identified as @xmath127 and using ( [ j2sim ] ) @xmath128 consequently , @xmath129    this represents a strong form of multiscaling , very similar to the one reported for the moments in the self - consistent solution for mn1 @xcite .",
    "also , @xmath130 can be computed effortlessly by making use of @xmath131 which reduces the calculation of the average of @xmath132 to a combination of moments of @xmath10 .",
    "use of this gives @xmath133 .",
    "finally , we just mention that the more general situation @xmath134 with @xmath135 leads to the following simple substitutions : @xmath136 to locate the critical point one has now to proceed numerically to search for the zeros of @xmath96 which can no longer be expressed in terms of parabolic - cylinder functions .",
    "consider again eq .",
    "( [ critical_mn ] ) where for convenience we have introduced a change in the sign of @xmath17 , which is now positive , @xmath137 this is a non - order - parameter langevin equation whose associated universality class can be studied by measuring the order - parameter @xmath138 .",
    "the corresponding stationary probability density is @xmath139 with @xmath140 at the transition .",
    "proceeding as in the mn1 case , we define @xmath141 and the self - consistent equation is now given by @xmath142 this last expression can be further simplified by making the change of variable @xmath143 and setting as before @xmath60 @xcite to obtain @xmath144 where @xmath145 and @xmath146 and @xmath147 are defined as above .",
    "next , an intermediate point @xmath148 is considered such that @xmath149 and @xmath66 is split as in equation ( [ split ] ) , @xmath150 .",
    "the exponential factor @xmath151 $ ] in @xmath152 is expanded , what leads to the following asymptotic behavior @xmath153 regarding @xmath73 , by virtue of the mean - value theorem @xmath154\\ ] ] where @xmath155 stands for the function @xmath156^p - c^{\\prime}[\\xi_i(m)/m]^{2p}}$ ] with @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "note that @xmath159 does not depend on @xmath79 .",
    "lastly , after substituting the self - consistent equation reads @xmath160 from which it is straightforward to extract the critical point @xmath161 and write @xmath162 this result has been verified by numerical integration of the self - consistent equation .    a calculation of the higher moments of the distribution ( [ pdfmn2 ] ) along the same lines as the previous section ( but with @xmath163 ) results in @xmath164 , and therefore @xmath165 while , as in mn1 , @xmath166 .",
    "results pertaining to @xmath39 are numerically verified in fig .",
    "we have investigated within the mean - field approximation the surface order - parameter @xmath167 at nonequilibrium , critical wetting transitions of kpz interfaces interacting with a wall .",
    "the model , as described by the langevin equation ( [ critical_mn ] ) , covers both positive ( mn2 @xmath20 ) and negative ( mn1 @xmath19 ) kpz nonlinearities .",
    "the more interesting case is that of negative kpz nonlinearities , where three different scaling regimes can be distinguished .    1 .   if @xmath168 a critical wetting transition exists characterized by the exponent @xmath169 and the critical temperature @xmath161",
    "we denote this the _ pure mean - field regime _ because these are the values that would have obtained had the noise and the laplacian terms been neglected in the equation , i.e. in the crudest possible mean - field limit ( [ critical_mn ] ) .",
    "if @xmath170 the critical wetting temperature is still given by @xmath161 but the critical exponent no longer depends solely on the potential details but also on the noise strength , @xmath171 .",
    "this is denoted the _ weak - noise regime_. 3 .   if @xmath172 the system enters a _",
    "strong - noise regime _ where the critical temperature is shifted away from zero , @xmath173 with @xmath112 the only zero of the parabolic - cylinder function @xmath174 , and @xmath175 .",
    "this rich structure is expected to hold at least qualitatively beyond mean - field theory as it is known that eq .",
    "( [ mn ] ) exhibits a strong - coupling regime for arbitrary high system dimensionalities .",
    "a similar scenario arises in the full solution of equilibrium critical wetting with long - ranged forces for which there are also three regimes for the behavior of @xmath33 , whose nature is similar to ours insofar as their origin can be traced back to the relevance of fluctuations as compared with the potential terms @xcite . as in the present case , in equilibrium",
    "a first regime exists which is correctly described by naive mean - field theory . in the second one the critical temperature is given correctly by mean - field theory , but the critical exponents are not , and in the third one fluctuations dominate and mean - field theory has nothing to say .",
    "an important difference exists , however , between our nonequilibrium self - consistent solution for negative kpz nonlinearities and equilibrium wetting in that the predictions for the former are for @xmath176 , while the three - regime behavior for the latter occurs only below the upper critical dimension @xmath177 . in higher dimensions equilibrium wetting is known to be controlled by a gaussian fixed point with trivial associated scaling @xcite .",
    "higher - order moments also display interesting behavior . all moments @xmath178 starting from @xmath179 scale with the same exponent , while the usual scaling @xmath180 obtains for @xmath181 .",
    "this same behavior was observed in a mean - field study of nonequilibrium , mn1 complete wetting as reported in @xcite , and seems to be a common feature of multiplicative - noise controlled transitions .",
    "additionally , it was found that the mean separation at the transition diverges as @xmath182 , with @xmath161 for @xmath183 and @xmath184 for @xmath185 .",
    "this implies that there is a single scaling regime in terms of @xmath186 rather than three . that the behavior of the surface order - parameter is richer than that of the mean separation is seemingly a common characteristic of these systems .    for positive kpz non - linearities",
    "has also been investigated and the results show a single regime @xmath187 , with higher moments scaling as @xmath188 .",
    "the mean interfacial separation grows logarithmically , @xmath189 .",
    "hence , positive kpz nonlinearities generate a trivial mean - field ( or high - dimensional ) behavior for nonequilibrium critical wetting , compatible with standard gaussian scaling , which is analogous to the mean - field behavior of equilibrium critical wetting . on the contrary ,",
    "negative kpz nonlinearities behave in a rather intricate way , with highly nontrivial scaling including three different regimes even in mean - field ( or high dimensions ) approximation .    in future work",
    "we will study how the rich phenomenology reported in this paper is affected by fluctuations , i.e. going beyond the mean field approximation .",
    "it would also be nice to have nonequilibrium critical wetting experiments to see whether our predictions can be observed in real systems .",
