    "backward elastic @xmath5 scattering at energies of several hundred mev is one of the simplest hadron ",
    "nucleus processes with high transferred momentum .",
    "it has been studied for more than 30 years both experimentally and theoretically with the aim of extracting information about the short  range structure of the @xmath6 interaction and the dynamics of high  momentum transfer in few  nucleon systems . besides the one  nucleon  exchange ( one ) mechanism ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , a number of concepts have been discussed in this context , e.g. the presence of nucleon resonances ( @xmath7 ) inside the deuteron @xcite , the importance of virtual pions @xcite , and three  baryon resonances @xcite ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "=    only at low energies , where one dominates , are the data on differential cross section , tensor analyzing power @xmath8 , and spin transfer coefficient @xmath9 , reasonably well described [ 4 - 8 ] . at higher energies , where internal momenta above 0.3  gev / c are probed in the deuteron ,",
    "the dynamics becomes more complicated , because of a possible excitation of @xmath7 and @xmath10 resonances in the intermediate states .",
    "these effects are taken into account to some extent in the one  pion  exchange model , but when adding the one amplitude , the problem of double counting arises @xcite .",
    "the excitation of the @xmath11 resonance in the intermediate state ( @xmath12 mechanism ) is explicitly included in a model @xcite , which also takes into account coherently one and single @xmath13 scattering ( ss ) in a consistent way ( fig",
    ".  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this model , improved in ref .",
    "@xcite with respect to the @xmath10 contribution through the analysis of @xmath14 data @xcite , describes the gross features of the @xmath5 spin  averaged differential cross section . after further refinement also the tensor analyzing power at beam energies below 0.5  gev",
    "is qualitatively reproduced @xcite . above the region ,",
    "where the @xmath10(1232 ) dominates , the role of intermediate excitations of heavier baryon resonances is expected to increase and this makes the theoretical interpretation of this process much more ambiguous .",
    "+ in view of the above complications , it would be very important to study a similar @xmath15 process , where contributions from the @xmath7 and @xmath12 resonance excitation are suppressed .",
    "for that purpose , an appropriate reaction is the deuteron breakup @xmath16 with emission of the two protons in forward direction ( @xmath17 ) at low excitation energy @xmath18  mev . with",
    "the neutron emitted backward , the kinematics of this reaction is quite close to that of @xmath15 backward elastic scattering .",
    "therefore , the same mechanisms can be applied in the analysis of the process as well . according to the one+ss+@xmath10 model calculations @xcite , which implicitly include the @xmath4 final  state interaction ( fsi ) , the @xmath4 pair is expected to be mainly in a @xmath19 state . due to isospin invariance",
    ", the isovector nature of the @xmath4 pair leads to a suppression of the amplitude of the @xmath10 mechanism by a factor three in comparison to the one amplitude for all partial waves of the @xmath4 system @xcite . the same suppression factor also applies for a broad class of diagrams with isovector meson ",
    "nucleon rescattering in the intermediate state , including excitation of @xmath7 resonances @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the contribution of the one mechanism , which is sensitive to the @xmath6 potential at short distances , becomes more pronounced than in @xmath5 scattering .",
    "furthermore , the node in the half  off ",
    "shell @xmath4 scattering amplitude in the @xmath19 state at an off  shell momentum of about 0.4  gev / c leads to a dip of the differential cross section of the deuteron breakup at 0.70.8  gev beam energy @xcite . at higher energies of 13  gev",
    ", the cross section is dominated by the one mechanism and decreases rather smoothly .",
    "+ another attractive feature of the process is the simplicity of its phenomenological description , since at zero degrees it requires only two spin amplitudes .",
    "therefore , a model  independent amplitude analysis becomes possible through the measurement of a few polarization observables . as a first step",
    ", we have measured the differential cross section at six beam energies in the interval 0.61.9  gev , which covers the region of the dip predicted by the one+ss+@xmath10 model , thereby probing a wide range of high internal momenta of the @xmath6 system ( @xmath20 0.30.6  gev / c ) .",
    "the experiment was performed at incident proton beam energies of 0.6 , 0.7 , 0.8 , 0.95 , 1.35 , and 1.9  gev with the spectrometer anke @xcite at the internal beam of the cooler synchrotron cosy ",

    "the produced charged particles , after passing the magnetic field of the dipole d2 , were registered by a set of three multiwire proportional chambers ( mwpc ) and a scintillation ",
    "counter hodoscope .",
    "each wire chamber contains a horizontal and a vertical anode  wire plane ( 1 mm wire spacing ) , and two planes of inclined strips , that allowed us to obtain the required resolution of @xmath24 0.81.2% ( rms ) in the momentum range 0.62.7  gev / c .",
    "+ the hodoscope consists of two layers , containing 8 and 9 vertically oriented scintillators ( 4 to 8  cm width , 1.5 to 2  cm thickness ) .",

    ". + the horizontal acceptance of the setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "=    the vertical acceptance corresponds to @xmath27 .",
    "the trigger rate resulted mainly from elastically and quasi  elastically scattered protons , from protons associated with meson production and , at beam energies below 1 gev , from deuterons produced in the @xmath28 reaction .",
    "events with two registered particles contributed little to the total trigger rate and were selected off  line .",
    "protons from the breakup process @xmath29 with an excitation energy @xmath18  mev could be detected with the experimental setup for laboratory polar angles between 0 and @xmath30 at all energies .",
    "+ among those events with two registered particles , breakup events are identified by the determination of the missing ",
    "mass value , calculated under the assumption that these particles are protons . at all energies the missing ",
    "mass spectra reveal a well defined peak at the neutron mass with an rms value of about 20  mev ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "=    the peak is clearly separated from the one at 1.11.2  gev / c@xmath31 , caused by proton pairs from the @xmath32 or @xmath33 reactions .",
    "a direct identification of the particle type is possible for those events for which the two particles hit different counters in the hodoscope .",
    "these amount to about 60% of all events in the peak at the neutron mass . for @xmath18  mev",
    ", the fraction varies from 60 to 22% for @xmath34 = 0.6 to 1.9  gev .",
    "the time  of  flight difference @xmath35 measured in the hodoscope was compared to the difference @xmath36 obtained from the reconstructed particle momenta @xmath37 and @xmath38 , again assuming that the two particles are protons . applying a 2@xmath39 cut to the peak of the @xmath40 distribution , proton pairs could be selected such that the contribution from other pairs was less than 1% .",
    "when both tracks hit the same counter , the energy loss distributions were analyzed and found to be in agreement with the assumption that both registered particles were protons .",
    "however , the energy loss cut was not used , since the proton separation from other particles was not quite perfect . in this case",
    "we relied on the fact that misidentified pairs ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 or @xmath44 ) show up only at substantially higher missing mass values and therefore can not contribute to the peak at the neutron mass . for background subtraction , the spectra in the vicinity of the neutron mass",
    "were fitted by the sum of a gaussian and a straight line ( see inset in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the number of proton pairs and the signal  to  background ratio @xmath45 were determined in a @xmath46 range around the neutron mass .",
    "the distribution of distances between hits by the proton pairs ( @xmath18  mev ) in the mwpc s yields rms values of 4.9 and 3.3  cm , at 0.6 and 1.9  gev beam energies , respectively .",
    "therefore , a significant loss of @xmath4 pairs due to the two tracks being too close is expected to occur only below @xmath47  mev . since a resolution of 0.2  ( 0.3 )  mev at @xmath48  mev was achieved , proton pairs with @xmath49  mev could be reliably selected .",
    "+ the integrated luminosity @xmath50 was obtained by counting protons , elastically and quasi  elastically scattered at small laboratory angles between 5 and @xmath51 .",
    "it is not possible to distinguish these processes experimentally at anke , but the achieved momentum resolution makes possible a clean separation from the meson production continuum .",
    "the number of counts obtained was related to a simulation using the calculated small angle @xmath52 cross section .",
    "the calculation takes into account the sum of elastic and inelastic terms in closure approximation of the glauber ",
    "franco theory @xcite , which includes the sum over the complete set of final @xmath53 states .",
    "in order to estimate the obtained accuracy , the cross sections , calculated for elastic and quasielastic @xmath15 scattering within the same framework , were compared with the experimental data of refs . @xcite and @xcite respectively , in the appropriate energy and angle range .",
    "the resulting @xmath54=0.85 ( n.d.f.=64 ) and @xmath54=0.73 ( n.d.f.=8 ) , respectively , yield a 7% uncertainty of the calculated cross sections .",
    "the total errors of the luminosities of table 1 take into account this uncertainty and other systematic errors of 5% , resulting from a small variation of the derived luminosity with the polar angle , caused by the position ",
    "dependent efficiency of the mwpc .",
    "the data allowed us to deduce the three  fold differential cross sections + @xmath55 ) , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the polar and azimuthal cm angles of the total momentum of the @xmath4 pair , respectively .",
    "( the neutron emission angles correspond to @xmath58 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the excitation energy distribution of the events for @xmath56 from 0 to @xmath30 and @xmath57 from 0 to @xmath59 , summed over the beam energies 0.6 , 0.7 , and 0.8  gev .",
    "the shape of the spectrum is well reproduced ( @xmath54=0.99 ) by the phase space distribution multiplied by the migdal ",
    "watson factor describing the @xmath19 fsi @xcite including coulomb effects .",
    "=    the event distribution over the angle between the relative momentum of the proton pair and its total momentum is nearly isotropic , but would allow a few percent of nonisotropic contamination to the differential cross section .",
    "the counting rates at high energies ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 gev ) were rather low .",

    "the correction factor @xmath70 , close to unity , accounts for several soft cuts applied during data processing .",
    "the acceptance was calculated as a function of @xmath71 and @xmath72 assuming a uniform distribution in @xmath73 and isotropy in the two proton system .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table1 ]    the differential cross section obtained as a function of beam energy is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .",
    "=    the energy dependence of the measured cross section is similar to that of the @xmath80 process , but its absolute value is smaller by about two orders of magnitude .",
    "there is no indication for the predicted dip in the breakup cross section .",
    "a comparison of the experimental results with the one+ss+@xmath10 calculations is shown also . at the lowest energies ( 0.60.7  gev ) the results for the reid soft core ( rsc ) @xcite and the paris @xcite potential reproduce rather well the measured breakup cross section .",
    "this energy range corresponds to the region where the @xmath10(1232 ) dominates in the @xmath5 cross section .",
    "the theoretical curves for the breakup process exhibit a shoulder at @xmath81  gev as well .",
    "this indicates that in spite of the isospin suppression , the contribution from the @xmath10 is still important because of the nearby minimum of the one cross section . at higher energies , including the region of the expected dip at 0.70.8  gev , the model is in strong disagreement with the data .",
    "one should note that the one+ss+@xmath10 model underestimates the @xmath5 cross section in the dip region ( @xmath82   gev ) as well @xcite .",

    "@xcite , where the contributions of @xmath83 components of the deuteron wave function are evaluated on the basis of a six quark model .",
    "correspondingly for the breakup , effects from @xmath7 exchanges and the contribution of the @xmath84 component of the deuteron can possibly increase the cross section in this region and fill the dip .",
    "other sizable contributions may arise from intermediate states of the @xmath4 pair at @xmath85   mev , de  excited by rescattering on the neutron in the final state .",
    "we report here the first measurement of the cross section of the @xmath86 reaction with a fast singlet @xmath4 pair emitted in forward direction at beam energies between @xmath87 and @xmath88   gev .",
    "the measurement was carried out in collinear kinematics close to those of @xmath15 backward elastic scattering .",
    "the known mechanisms of the @xmath80 process describe reasonably well the measured breakup cross section at low energies ( 0.60.7  gev ) . at higher energies the calculations depend on the @xmath6 interaction potential at short distances and disagree with the data .",
    "possible shortcomings of the model may be attributed at present to an inappropriate choice of the reaction dynamics or inadequate assumptions about the short  range structure of the deuteron .",
    "the latter could be remedied by more detailed calculations using modern @xmath6 potentials , which are in progress .",
