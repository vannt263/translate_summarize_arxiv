    "the theory of open quantum systems ( oqs ) deals with non - unitary dynamics among quantum states of a sub - system coupled with some unobservable degrees of freedom in their surroundings @xcite .",
    "this is actually a very common situation since no physical system can truly be considered as isolated .",
    "the additional degrees of freedom that make up the environment can take many physical forms such as phonons in solids , photons in cavities , charge fluctuations , or molecular vibrations .",
    "they are responsible for a wide variety of basic processes and , in particular , thermalization , energy and charge transfers , decoherence . as a consequence ,",
    "the scope of oqs encompasses several disciplines of both fundamental and technological importance , from struggling against decoherence in superconducting qubits of quantum information , to electronic and proton transfers in flexible proteins .",
    "this is why oqs theory has attracted considerable attention both from physics and chemistry communities .",
    "understanding non - equilibrium dynamics in oqs where dissipation and coherence evolve simultaneously is by itself a great challenge , but even more important is the depiction of feasible quantum control strategies to optimize physical observables such as decoherence rates or efficient and fast charge transfers over large molecules . as an illustrative example",
    ", non - linear ultra - fast optics experiments have shown the possibility to protect from environmental fluctuations , on picosecond time scales , photosynthetic organisms in molecular light harvesting materials @xcite .",
    "this has even led to the emergence of a new interdisciplinary field : quantum biology @xcite . in this work",
    "we are concerned by a strong laser control scheme addressing oqs described in a standard topology of a central system of few degrees of freedom coupled to an external and much larger set of environmental modes , namely , the residual bath which damps the dynamics .",
    "this problem could naively be approached by a time - dependent wave function evolution incorporating both the central system and the bath .",
    "but its feasibility would be very soon affected with the increasing number of degrees of freedom .",
    "it is important to have in mind that even referring to high performance variational codes like mctdh with multi - layer , time - adapted basis set expansions , but only a few hundreds of such vibrational modes can reasonably be taken into account @xcite .",
    "stochastic methods would also be limited to comparable numbers of degrees of freedom @xcite . a strong field floquet type of approach , as has been applied to h@xmath0 photodissociation by andr bandrauk and coworkers , would even be worse , as the resulting number of close coupled equations to describe the multiphoton excitation process would lead to computationally non tractable issues @xcite .",
    "one of the goals of oqs theory is precisely to avoid a full integration of all the degrees of freedom by describing the dynamics in a reduced hilbert space , through a reduced density matrix .",
    "more specifically , such a reduction is obtained by tracing out the bath degrees of freedom from the full density matrix . in some cases",
    "the damping could be an almost pure , memory - less dissipation.the dynamics is then approximately described referring to markovian master equations in the so - called lindblad form @xcite extensively used in atomic physics , quantum optics , semiconductors .",
    "this approximation assumes an instantaneous recovery of the bath from the interaction with a continuous flow of information from the central system to its environment .",
    "but , when aiming at control oqs at different times and length scales , or different energy and temperature ranges , dissipation and decoherence dynamics could be such that the bath response to the central system can no longer be neglected , leading thus to non - markovian behaviours characterized by a back - flow of information .",
    "two classes of control strategies can be devised : either acting on the central system alone , or on both the central system and its environmental bath .",
    "the present work is concerned by the simplest scenario where a strong static field produces a stark shift affecting the eigen - energies of a two - level central system leading to different coupling schemes with the bath .",
    "a more complete scenario would be the one which takes advantage of the non - markovian response of the bath to control the full system dynamics @xcite .",
    "such an ultimate goal could presumably be reached by referring to some collective modes which guide the flow of information from the central system to the bath in a reversible manner @xcite .",
    "but we still expect that the stark shift affecting the central system can be used as a first step for enhancing non - markovian behaviours .",
    "obviously a requisite of any control strategy exploiting non - markovianity is a quantitative measure of such a behaviour .",
    "several measures characterizing non - markovianity have been proposed in the literature @xcite , among them the volume of accessible states @xcite and more recently the appearance of negative decoherence rates from several possible decoherence channels @xcite .",
    "the relative merits of such measures based on the quantum dynamical map ( with a matrix representation @xmath1 ) of the reduced density matrix elements deserve interest .",
    "more specifically , the volume of accessible states within the bloch sphere , given by the determinant of @xmath1 , evolves in time with a total rate @xmath2 .",
    "the time - dependence of @xmath2 , as opposite to a constant value , is a signature of memory effects .",
    "but an even more sensitive signature would be reached through the partial decoherence rates @xmath3 towards the different decoherence channels @xmath4 of the dynamics .",
    "their calculation is based on , roughly speaking , a logarithmic derivative of @xmath1 , diagonalizing @xmath5 .",
    "these partial rates sum up to @xmath2 but could individually and temporarily be negative , as signatures of information back - flow from the bath to the central system .",
    "we are postponing their detailed analysis to a forthcoming paper .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : theo ] is devoted to the theory describing the dynamics of a two - level system coupled to a bosonic bath , the so - called spin - boson model . a canonical ( system hamiltonian - independent ) form for a time - local master equation is introduced , for a _ generic _ @xmath6 mapping matrix .",
    "this is done by closely following the derivation of ref.@xcite .",
    "the system - specific reduced density matrix evolution and the resulting _ physical _",
    "@xmath6 is calculated by numerically solving a nakajima - zwanzig type of evolution using hierarchical equations of motion ( heom ) up to convergence , for the memory kernel @xcite .",
    "the results are discussed in section [ sec : results ] in terms of the time - evolution of an observable taken as the volume of states decaying with @xmath2 .",
    "the most important observation is the enhancement of the non - markovian behaviour when the two - level system internal transition frequency is off - resonance with respect to the maximum of the spectral density measuring the frequency distribution of the system - bath couplings .",
    "the control knob is then the external field strength inducing the stark shift that monitors the system transition frequency ( from on- to off - resonance ) . at this stage ,",
    "the control targets the optimization of decoherence rates in order to slow down the overall decay , which by itself opens important applications in protecting quantum information lost or obtaining long - lived alignment - orientation in molecular dynamics ( although not described by a spin - boson hamiltonian ) , for instance .",
    "future perspectives on other control goals aiming at adequately designing collective modes in the bath could open the way for efficient charge or proton transfer processes in large molecular systems .",
    "these are mentioned in the conclusion , section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in many situations , in particular in liquid and solid state physics , memory effects due to the non - markovian character of the dynamics have to be taken into account @xcite . at this point , a natural question about a given experimental system is to which extent the relaxation effects lead to non - markovian dynamics . in the past few years",
    ", the problem of how to measure non - markovianity has sparked remarkable interest , starting with refs .",
    "number of quantitative measures have been proposed since these initial attempts @xcite .",
    "in addition to the theoretical studies , recent experimental works @xcite have shown that it is by now possible to engineer oqs and to drive it from the markovian to the non - markovian regimes . however , the measures recently proposed in the literature are well - suited to theoretical or abstract situations , where for example the dynamics can be solved analytically .",
    "very few papers have explored more complicated model systems where the time evolution of the oqs can only be achieved numerically @xcite .",
    "a benchmark example in this category is the spin boson model which will be analyzed in this paper . we will consider for this model system a specific measure of non - markovianity , namely the volume of accessible state space @xcite . the goal of this paragraph is to briefly summarize the computation of this measure .",
    "the reader is referred to the original papers for technical details .",
    "the dynamics of a markovian open quantum system is typically ruled by a quantum dynamical semi - group @xcite .",
    "the most general representation of such semigroup is given by the lindblad - kossakowski equation @xcite which can be expressed as : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the density matrix of the central system under study and @xmath9 a generator in lindblad form .",
    "this latter can be written as : @xmath10+\\sum_i \\gamma_i [ a_i\\rho_s a_i^\\dagger-\\frac{1}{2}\\{a_i^\\dagger a_i,\\rho_s\\}],\\ ] ] @xmath11 being the hamiltonian of the system , the coefficients @xmath12 the relaxation rates and the @xmath13 the time - independent lindblad operators .",
    "hereafter , we assume that @xmath8 is a density matrix of a finite - dimensional hilbert space , typically of dimension two for a spin system . in this case , the dynamics is characterized by three relaxation rates , @xmath14 .",
    "this formalism can be generalized to a time - local master equation where the generator @xmath9 depends on time while preserving its general form : @xmath15\\\\ & & + \\sum_i \\gamma_i(t ) [ a_i(t)\\rho_s a_i^\\dagger ( t)-\\frac{1}{2}\\{a_i^\\dagger ( t)a_i(t),\\rho_s\\}].\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we stress here that both the relaxation rates @xmath14 and the lindblad operators @xmath16 may now depend on time .",
    "the process remains markovian if the rates are positive for any time @xmath17 , and presumably becomes non - markovian otherwise @xcite .",
    "recent studies have investigated the issue of the description of the dynamics of non - markovian systems which can be given either by a non - local master equation with memory kernel obtained , e.g. , from the nakajima - zwanzig technique @xcite , or by a local in time equation @xcite .",
    "we give here a simple argument showing that any time evolution of the density matrix of the system can be ruled by a time - local equation .",
    "we introduce the quantum dynamical map @xmath6 of the system which satisfies : @xmath18 differentiating eq .",
    "( [ eqf ] ) with respect to time leads to : @xmath19 if we assume that the dynamical map is not singular at time @xmath17 , i.e. that the determinant of the corresponding matrix is different from 0 , then the inverse @xmath20 of @xmath1 can be defined and eq .",
    "( [ eqlind ] ) can be rewritten as follows : @xmath21 which is a master equation local in time .",
    "the non - markovian character of the dynamics is then associated with the values of the relaxation rates of the generator @xmath9 .",

    "<S> laser control of open quantum systems ( oqs ) is a challenging issue as compared to its counterpart in isolated small size molecules , basically due to very large numbers of degrees of freedom to be accounted for . </S>",
    "<S> such a control aims at appropriately optimizing decoherence processes of a central two - level system ( a given vibrational mode , for instance ) towards its environmental bath ( including , for instance , all other normal modes ) . </S>",
    "<S> a variety of applications could potentially be envisioned , either to preserve the central system from decaying ( long duration molecular alignment or orientation , qubit decoherence protection ) or , to speed up the information flow towards the bath ( efficient charge or proton transfers in long chain organic compounds ) . </S>",
    "<S> achieving such controls require some quantitative measures of decoherence in relation with memory effects in the bath response , actually given by the degree of non - markovianity . </S>",
    "<S> characteristic decoherence rates of a spin - boson model are calculated using a nakajima - zwanzig type master equation with converged heom expansion for the memory kernel . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that , by adequately tuning the two - level transition frequency through a controlled stark shift produced by an external laser field , non - markovianity can be enhanced in a continuous way leading to a first attempt towards the control of oqs .    33.80.-b , 03.65.yz , 42.50.hz    open quantum systems , measure of non - markovianity , coherence , spin - boson model , laser control . </S>"
