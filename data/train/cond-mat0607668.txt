    "at the present time , low energy high fluence ion implantation is widely used for producing the active regions of modern integrated microcircuits .",
    "a combination of ion implantation having energies of about 10 kev with rapid thermal annealing allows one to create doped layers with a depth of about 100 nm @xcite . to calculate the distributions of electrically active dopant atoms in such small regions , models of clustering having a high degree of accuracy",
    "should be used .",
    "the implementation of the adequate models of clustering is very important because saturation of electron density is observed experimentally for high dopant concentrations ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "thus , only a part of dopant atoms is electrically active , and we have difficulties in achieving high carrier concentrations .",
    "unfortunately , all up - to - date models can not adequately explain this phenomenon .",

    "the main feature of the model of @xcite is the assumption that clustered as atoms are electrically active ( positively charged ) at annealing temperatures , while at room temperature they are neutral .",
    "therefore , the electron concentration at room temperature @xmath13 is approximately equal to the concentration of substitutionally dissolved arsenic atoms @xmath14 . the assumption that as clusters are capable of trapping the conduction electrons and becoming neutral during cooling allows one to explain the saturation of electron density when @xmath15 @xcite . here",

    "the clustering phenomenon was investigated with the example of ge doped by as .",
    "it was proposed that cluster formation occurred due to the reaction    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the substitutionally dissolved donor atom ; @xmath29 is the intrinsic point defect in the neutral charge state ; @xmath30 is the number of substitutionally dissolved atoms participating in the reaction ; @xmath31 is the cluster formed ; @xmath32 is the charge of this cluster .",

    "it was found that for neutral clusters the dependence @xmath36 has the following form :    @xmath37    it follows from expression ( [ dependence_fistul_neutral ] ) that at high impurity concentrations the line with the angle @xmath38 in the logarithmical coordinates is asymptotic for the dependence @xmath36 @xcite .",

    "@xcite , the clustering of phosphorus atoms was investigated numerically .",
    "due to numerical solution , the limitations of @xcite were removed .",
