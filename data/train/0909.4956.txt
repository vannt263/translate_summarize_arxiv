    "the notion of generalized offset ( see @xcite , @xcite for a more formal definition of this notion and a large study of algebraic and geometric properties ) arises in the literature as a generalization of usual offsets . in order to introduce this notion",
    ", one may consider the following construction over a given algebraic curve @xmath0 : for every non - isotropic , regular point @xmath1 , take the normal line @xmath2 to @xmath3 at @xmath4 , rotate it @xmath5 degrees , and consider the points @xmath6 lying on @xmath2 at a distance @xmath7 of @xmath4 .",
    "then the generalized offset @xmath8 is the zariski closure of the set consisting of all the points @xmath6 computed this way . in this context ,",
    "the usual notion of offset ( which corresponds to the case when @xmath5 defines a rotation leaving @xmath2 invariant ) is called the classical offset @xmath9 of the curve ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , in figure 1 one has , for different distances , the classical and the generalized offsets for @xmath10 of an ellipse .",
    "notice that this construction works over @xmath11 ; nevertheless , in the following we will assume that @xmath3 is real , and we will focus on the real part of its generalized offset , for a real distance and a real angle .",
    "@xmath12    algebraic properties of generalized offsets have been considered in the literature ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in this sense",
    ", a nice result is that properties like the number of components , genus and therefore rationality , are invariant for the angle @xmath5 ; so , they are shared by all the generalized offsets ( including the classical offset ) of a given curve .",
    "thus , it is natural to wonder whether the same happens when the shape of generalized offsets is considered .",
    "this paper explores this problem from a local point of view .",
    "questions on the shape of classical offsets have already been analyzed ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , in @xcite local aspects on the shape of classical offsets of possibly singular algebraic curves are studied . in that paper",
    "the notion of _ local shape _ is introduced in order to locally describe the shape of a curve .",
    "basically , this notion describes the shape of a real branch of an algebraic curve in the vicinity of a point .",
    "so , one may prove ( see @xcite , @xcite ) that there are four different behaviors that a real branch can exhibit , which can be found in figure 2 ( see section [ sec - prelim ] ) , corresponding to so - called _ local shapes ( i ) , ( ii ) , ( iii ) , ( iv)_. moreover , each of these possibilities has a characterization in terms of _ places _ ( see also section [ sec - prelim ] in this paper ; for more information on the notion of place , we refer the reader to @xcite ) . hence , given a geometric transformation like classical or generalized offsetting , in order to analyze how the transformation locally affects the curve",
    "one can take a generic place , compute the places it gives rise to in the transformed object , and compare the local shapes of the original and the final places .",
    "if all these local shapes coincide , then it means that the transformation has not introduced local changes in the shape of the curve ; otherwise , some local change has occurred .",
    "since this strategy can be applied at both regular and singular points , in particular the notion of local shape gives us a way of analyzing the behavior at singularities .",
    "the notion of local shape has also been used in @xcite for addressing not only local , but also global questions on the shape of classical offset curves .",
    "finally , the structure of the paper is the following . in section [ sec - prelim ]",
    "we provide the necessary background for developing our results ; in particular , the notion of local shape is reviewed here . in section [ sec - behav - reg ]",
    "we address the behavior of regular points under generalized offsetting processes ; the results in this section are proven by using elements of differential geometry , without making use of the notion of local shape . in section 4 ,",
    "we use the notion of local shape for giving a more complete description of the phenomenon , including the behavior at singularities . in section [ sec - comparison ] , we summarize the main results in the paper and we provide a comparison between the local properties of the shapes of classical and non - classical generalized offsets .    _ acknowledgements . _",
    "the author wishes to thank j. rafael sendra for suggesting the problem .",
    "in the following we work with an algebraic curve @xmath3 different from a line , a real distance @xmath13 , and a real angle @xmath5 . one may easily see that generalized offsets to lines are also lines ; therefore , for lines the analysis is trivial .",
    "since @xmath3 is algebraic , around every real non - isolated point @xmath1 one can find at least one local parametrization @xmath14 where @xmath15 are real analytic functions and @xmath16 . in the language of _ places _ ( see @xcite ) one says that @xmath4 is the _ center _ of the _ place _ @xmath17 .",
    "the functions @xmath15 are called the _ coordinates _ or the _ components _ of the place , and are analytic in a neighborhood @xmath18 of @xmath19 . now writing @xmath20we represent by @xmath21 the _ order _ of @xmath22 , i.e. the least non - zero power of @xmath23 in the expression of @xmath22",
    "; similarly we introduce @xmath24 .",
    "moreover , we speak of  real \" places to denote places where the coefficients @xmath25 , perhaps after a change of parameter , are real numbers .",
    "then we consider the following definition .",
    "[ pairassociated]let @xmath17 be a real place of @xmath26 .",
    "the signature of @xmath17 is defined as the pair @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the first non - zero natural number such that the derivative @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the first natural number such that @xmath31 are linearly independent .",
    "we denote by @xmath32 the signature of @xmath33 .    since @xmath3 by hypothesis is not a line ,",
    "the numbers @xmath34 in definition [ pairassociated ] always exist . now",
    "if @xmath35 then we say that @xmath33 is _ regular _ , otherwise we say that it is _",
    "singular_. the center of a singular place is always a singular point of @xmath3 .",
    "now , in @xcite ( see proposition 3 there ) it is proven that in a suitable coordinate system , every real non - isolated point @xmath1 is the center of a real place @xmath36 of the type @xmath37 where @xmath27 is the signature of the place . if a place has this form , we say that it is in _ standard _ form ; notice that when the place is in standard form , @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite , @xcite it is shown that the local behavior of @xmath39 around its center can be read from the signature , giving rise to the notion of local shape .",
    "we recall this notion here .",
    "[ def1 ] let @xmath17 be a real place of signature @xmath27 , centered at @xmath40 .",
    "then we say that :    * @xmath17 is a thorn ( or it has local shape ( i ) ) if both @xmath34 are even .",
    "* @xmath17 is an elbow ( or it has local shape ( ii ) ) if @xmath28 is odd , and @xmath41 is even .",
    "* @xmath17 is a beak ( or it has local shape ( iii ) ) if @xmath28 is even , and @xmath41 is odd .",
    "* @xmath17 is a flex ( or it has local shape ( iv ) ) if both @xmath34 are odd .    in figure 2",
    "one can see the shape corresponding to each local shape up to rotations . in each case , the center of the place is the intersection point of the two dotted lines .",
    "furthermore , in all cases the horizontal dotted line is tangent to @xmath26 in the direction of @xmath42 .",
    "we also note that if @xmath43 is regular , then @xmath44 , and therefore the only possibilities for the local shape of @xmath17 are ( ii ) or ( iv ) . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath28 is even we say that the place is _",
    "cuspidal_.     +",
    "in the rest of the paper , we will represent the generalized offset of @xmath3 , for a distance @xmath13 and an angle @xmath5 , as @xmath45 ; in particular , if @xmath46 we have the classical offset , @xmath47 .",
    "moreover , for local aspects in the topology of classical offsets we refer the reader to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "so , here we focus on generalized , non - classical , offsets .",
    "now along this section let @xmath14 be a real regular place of @xmath3 .",
    "since @xmath17 converges in a neighborhood @xmath18 of @xmath19 , we can regard @xmath48 , with @xmath49 , as the parametrization of a regular curve ; moreover , we can assume that it has been reparametrized by the arc - length .",
    "we will represent by @xmath50 the vector whose components are the coordinates of @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , we denote by @xmath51 the vector whose components are the coordinates of a place generated by @xmath17 in @xmath45 . hence , denoting as @xmath52 the normal vector to @xmath17 at its center ( i.e. the normal vector to the curve represented by @xmath17 at the point @xmath53 ) and denoting the matrix defining a rotation of angle @xmath5 as @xmath54",
    ", it follows that @xmath55now the first result , which shows an important difference between classical and generalized offsets , is the following .",
    "[ th - no - cusps ] the only generalized offset which may transform a regular place into a singular offset place , is the classical offset .",
    "therefore , the generalized , non - classical , offset , never generates a cusp from a regular point of the original curve .",
    "* proof . * differentiating the equality @xmath56 w.r.t . the arc - length and using frenet equations",
    ", it follows that @xmath57where @xmath58 is the curvature of @xmath17 at its center .",
    "now @xmath59 iff @xmath60 . however , @xmath61 . then @xmath62 iff @xmath63 and simultaneously @xmath64 . since we are assuming that @xmath13 and @xmath65 ( i.e. @xmath3 is not a line ) this holds iff @xmath66 , i.e. when one is working with the classical offset , and @xmath67 .",
    "in particular , if the offset is non - classical then @xmath68 ; since we start from a regular place , then @xmath69 and therefore @xmath70 .",
    "[ tangents ] when the offset is classical , it is well - known that the tangents to the curve and its offset are parallel at corresponding points . for the generalized",
    "offset , the above expression @xmath71 tells us that this no longer happens ; moreover , the tangent line to the generalized offset at a point @xmath72 is not even the @xmath5-rotation of the tangent line to @xmath3 at the point @xmath4 generating @xmath72 .    in figure 3",
    "one may see , for @xmath73 , the classical offset to the parabola @xmath74 , and a detail of this offset showing two cusps ; in figure 4 one has the generalized offset of the same curve , also for @xmath73 and a very small angle , @xmath75 .",
    "the reader may see in figure 4 that in the generalized offset the cusps have been replaced by rounded arcs .",
    "@xmath76    @xmath77    now let us address the question of checking whether the local shape of regular places is preserved or not by the generalized offsetting process ( we say that the local shape of a place is _ preserved _",
    ", if the local shapes of the places that it generates in the generalized offset coincide with the original local shape ) . since regular places are either elbows or flex points , the question reduces to analyzing whether generalized offsets preserve flex points coming from regular places . for the classical offsets the answer is  yes \" ( see @xcite )",
    "; however , in the generalized , non - classical case , we will see that the answer is  no \" . for this purpose , we recall that the curvature at a regular flex point is @xmath19 .",
    "hence , let @xmath78 denote the curvature of @xmath45 at the center of the place generated by @xmath17 ; from the well - known formula of the curvature , we have that @xmath79where @xmath80 is normal to the plane containing @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "thus , the following theorem holds .",
    "[ th - reg - flex - points ] the regular points of @xmath3 generating flex points of @xmath45 , satisfy @xmath83as a consequence , the generalized , non - classical , offset does not necessarily preserve flex points .",
    "* let us compute the numerator of the above expression for @xmath78 .",
    "in order to do this , we have that @xmath84 .",
    "differentiating again , we get @xmath85thus , @xmath86notice that @xmath87 ( i.e. the derivative of the curvature w.r.t .",
    "the arc - length ) exists because since @xmath17 is regular , then @xmath58 is an analytic function .",
    "now since @xmath54 represents a rotation of angle @xmath5 then @xmath88 ( because we are assuming that @xmath17 has been re - parametrized w.r.t .",
    "the arc - length ) , and @xmath89 .",
    "moreover for the same reason the angle between , on one hand , the vectors @xmath90 , and on the other hand , the vectors @xmath91 , is @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , if we represent by @xmath92 the angle between @xmath93 and @xmath94 , the angle between @xmath95 and @xmath93 is @xmath96 , and similarly the angle between @xmath97 and @xmath94 is @xmath98 .",
    "hence , @xmath99now , expanding @xmath100 and @xmath101 , taking into account the formula for @xmath58 in terms of @xmath102 and @xmath103 , and computing the dot product with @xmath103 , one gets that @xmath104 now from theorem [ th - no - cusps ] it holds that @xmath105 , and hence @xmath106 iff @xmath107 ; then , every point of @xmath3 giving rise to a flex point of the generalized offset fulfills this equality .",
    "finally , notice that a regular flex point of @xmath3 satisfies that @xmath108 , but not necessarily that @xmath109 .",
    "so , such a point does not necessarily fulfills the condition in the statement of the theorem and therefore flex points are not necessarily preserved .",
    "in fact , in the next section we will see that generalized , non - classical , offsets _ never _ preserve flex points ( see corollary [ no - flex - points ] ) .",
    "also , observe that the condition in theorem [ th - reg - flex - points ] is not sufficient because the fact that @xmath106 does not necessarily imply that the point in @xmath45 is a flex ( it depends on the order of the first non - vanishing derivative of @xmath78 ) .",
    "finally , we address the _ turning points _ ( i.e. points of either horizontal or vertical tangent ) of the generalized , non - classical offset . in the classical case ,",
    "it is well - known that the tangents to @xmath3 and @xmath47 at corresponding points , are parallel ; hence , turning points of the offset are generated by turning points of the original curve , and conversely .",
    "however , the following result shows that for generalized , non - classical , offsets this property does not hold in general .",
    "[ th - turning - points ] let @xmath45 denote a generalized , non - classical offset of @xmath3 .",
    "the following statements are true :    * the points of @xmath45 with vertical tangent , generated by regular points of @xmath3 , correspond to : ( i ) points of @xmath3 with vertical tangent , where @xmath108 ; ( ii ) points of @xmath3 , with @xmath65 , where the slope of the tangent equals @xmath110 . *",
    "the points of @xmath45 with horizontal tangent , generated by regular points of @xmath3 , correspond to : ( i ) points of @xmath3 with horizontal tangent , where @xmath108 ; ( ii ) points of @xmath3 , with @xmath63 , and horizontal tangent ; ( iii ) points of @xmath3 , with @xmath111 , where the slope of the tangent equals @xmath112 .",
    "* from the proof of theorem [ th - no - cusps ] it holds that the relationship between the tangents of @xmath3 and @xmath45 at corresponding points is @xmath71 . in order to prove ( 1 ) , one considers the first component of @xmath113 , namely @xmath114 , and one imposes that it is @xmath19 . hence , either @xmath108 and @xmath115 , or @xmath65 and @xmath116 ( notice that @xmath13 by hypothesis and @xmath117 because the offset is not classical ) .",
    "similarly for ( 2 ) .",
    "along this section we consider a real place @xmath118 , non - necessarily regular , a distance @xmath13 , and an angle @xmath119 ( i.e. we work with a non - classical generalized offset ; see @xcite for a study of the classical case ) .",
    "moreover , we write @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and we represent the coordinates of a place generated by @xmath14 in @xmath45 as @xmath122 . in order to analyze how the generalized offsetting process affects the local shape of @xmath17 , the idea is to compare the local shape of @xmath122 with the original local shape . for this purpose , we compute the generalized offset of @xmath17 for the previously fixed @xmath123 .",
    "thus , we have that : @xmath124 we recall from @xcite that , performing computations with formal power series , @xmath125plugging this expression into the first equality and making computations , one gets that , whenever @xmath126 , @xmath127and @xmath128moreover , in the special case when @xmath129 ( i.e. if @xmath130 ) one has that @xmath131and @xmath132    one may observe that the first order terms of @xmath133 coincide in both cases , @xmath126 and @xmath129 . furthermore , @xmath134 .",
    "however , @xmath135 and therefore it depends on the sign of @xmath136 ; moreover , when @xmath137 we also have to distinguish whether the coefficient of @xmath138 in @xmath139 , namely @xmath140 , is equal to @xmath19 or not .",
    "all these cases ( @xmath141 , @xmath137 , @xmath142 ) and subcases will be present in our analysis . furthermore , from theorem 11 in @xcite one may see that the case @xmath141 happens iff the curvature vanishes at the center of the place , while the case @xmath142 occurs iff the curvature tends to infinity as the center of the place is approached .    also , in the following we separately address results that can be reached by considering only the first order terms of @xmath133 ( see subsection [ subsec - first - order ] ) , and results which require to consider also second order terms in @xmath133 ( see subsection [ subsec - second - order ] ) . for the second type of results we will need to distinguish the cases @xmath126 or @xmath129 .",
    "we start with the following result ; this proposition shows that in some cases , generalized offsetting processes smooth singularities , i.e. they transform singular places into regular ones .",
    "this phenomenon happens also for classical offsets ( see @xcite ) .",
    "[ regular - places ] let @xmath17 be a place of @xmath3 with signature @xmath27 . if @xmath143 , then @xmath17 generates regular offset places ; as a consequence , if @xmath17 is cuspidal ( i.e. @xmath28 is even ) and @xmath143 , then its local shape is not preserved .",
    "conversely , if @xmath17 is singular and it is smoothed by the generalized , non - classical , offsetting process ( i.e. it generates regular places in the generalized offset ) , then @xmath143 .    *",
    "proof . * since @xmath134 , if @xmath143 we have that the places generated by @xmath17 are regular .",
    "in particular , in that case these places can not be cuspidal ; so , if @xmath17 is cuspidal and @xmath143 its local shape is not preserved .",
    "conversely , if @xmath17 is singular then @xmath144 . now",
    "if it generates regular places then either @xmath145 or @xmath146 is equal to 1 . since @xmath147 , if @xmath148 then @xmath149 , which is impossible because both @xmath150 are greater than 1 .",
    "thus we conclude that @xmath143 .    using the results of section 4 of @xcite , one may check that classical offsets also smooth singular places iff @xmath143 .",
    "now we consider the case @xmath141 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath151 and therefore @xmath152 .",
    "hence , the following theorem holds .      *",
    "if @xmath17 is singular , then it generates singular offset places . * the local shape of the offset places generated by @xmath17 behaves according to the following table : + [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "hence , we observe a great number of differences between the local behavior in the classical and the non - classical case , both at regular and singular points ( where the situation is far more intricate in the non - classical case ) .",
