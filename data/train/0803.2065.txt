    "we refer to schrijver @xcite for basic terminology , facts and notations about linear programming .    the corresponding _ integer program _",
    "is defined as @xmath23 we say that @xmath24 is _ generic _ for @xmath2 if the integer program @xmath25 has a unique optimal solution for all @xmath26 .",
    "if @xmath27 is generic then @xmath28 and each linear program @xmath29 also has a unique optimal solution for all @xmath30 but the converse is not true in general .",
    "however , the converse clearly holds for tdi systems : the system @xmath31 is _ totally dual integral _ _ ( tdi _ ) if @xmath14 has an integer optimal solution @xmath32 for each @xmath33 . in other words ,",
    "the system @xmath34 defining @xmath35 is tdi exactly if the optimal values of @xmath14 and of @xmath36 coincide for all @xmath37 .",
    "( if @xmath28 , lp and dp are both feasible and bounded . )",
    "this is a slight twist of notation when compared to habits in combinatorial optimization : we defined the tdi property for the dual problem , in order to be in accordance with notations in computational algebra .",
    "totally dual integral ( tdi ) systems of linear inequalities play a central role in combinatorial optimization .",
    "the recognition of tdi systems has been recently proved to be conp - complete by ding , feng and zang @xcite and this result has been sharpened to the recognition of explicitly given systems with only @xmath38 coefficient vectors , and where the defined polyhedron has exactly one vertex ( hilbert basis testing by pap @xcite ) .",
    "graph theory results of chudnovsky , cornu ' ejols , liu , seymour and vukovi @xcite allow one to recognize tdi systems with @xmath38 coefficient matrices and right hand sides .",
    "however , solving the corresponding dual pair of integer linear programs ( including the coloration of perfect graphs ) in polynomial time with combinatorial algorithms remains open even in this special case .",
    "the fixed dimension case has been solved long ago @xcite , whereas the fixed codimension case only recently @xcite , @xcite , the first using a generalization of integer programming , the second computer algebra , both starting from a characterization of hilbert bases in @xcite .",
    "a particular case where the recognition of tdi systems is still open , is the case of generic systems ( problem  [ prob : unimod ] ) , which is slightly more general than the perfectness test ( detecting perfection in a graph ) , and could be a possible start for an alternative , simpler algorithm for the latter .",
    "this paper wishes to contribute to testing tdi in cases that occur in integer programming and combinatorial optimization , and which usually do not belong to the extremities that have been understood so far .    in section  [ sec : tdi ] , characterizing properties of tdi systems",
    "are provided .",
    "some of these properties involve tools from combinatorial optimization , some others from computational algebra .",
    "section  [ sec : perfect ] specializes these results to integral set packing polytopes .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : computation ] exhibits the possible alternatives and their relative efficiency for recognizing tdi systems .",
    "the remainder of this introduction is devoted to explaining the main results and providing some of the necessary background .    a collection of subsets @xmath39 of @xmath40 $ ]",
    "will be called a _ regular subdivision _ of @xmath2 if there exists @xmath24 , and @xmath41 , such that @xmath42 for all @xmath43 and @xmath44 for all @xmath45 .",
    "the sets @xmath46 are called the _ cells _ of the regular subdivision and the regular subdivision is denoted by @xmath47 or simply @xmath48 when @xmath2 is unambiguous .",
    "equivalently , regular subdivisions are simply capturing _ complementary slackness _ from linear programming .",
    "namely , a feasible solution to @xmath14 is optimal if and only if the support of the feasible solution is a subset of some cell of @xmath48 .",
    "geometrically , @xmath48 can be thought of as a partition of @xmath8 by the inclusionwise maximal ones among the cones @xmath49 ; each such cone is generated by the normal vectors of defining inequalities of faces of @xmath19 , each maximal cell indexes the set of normal vectors of inequalities satisfied with equality by a vertex ( or minimal face ) of @xmath50 .",
    "the @xmath51 above are these vertices and so the regular subdivision @xmath48 is geometrically realized as the _ normal fan _ of @xmath19 .    a regular subdivision of @xmath2 is called a _ triangulation _ if the columns of each @xmath52 are linearly independent for all @xmath53 .",
    "note that a regular subdivision @xmath48 is a triangulation if and only if every vertex is contained in exactly @xmath3 facets ; that is , the polyhedron @xmath19 is _ simple _ , or , _ non - degenerate_. a triangulation @xmath48 is called _ unimodular _ if @xmath54 for each maximal cell of @xmath48 .",
    "refinement _ of a subdivision @xmath48 of @xmath2 is another subdivision @xmath55 of @xmath2 so that each cell of @xmath56 is contained in some cell of @xmath48 .",
    "a set @xmath57 is a _ hilbert basis _ if @xmath58 ; we will say that a matrix @xmath59 is a hilbert basis if its columns form a hilbert basis .",
    "note that if for some @xmath60 @xmath48 is a unimodular triangulation of @xmath2 then cramer s rule implies that @xmath2 itself is a hilbert basis .",
    "let @xmath61 denote the family of integer programs @xmath36 having a feasible solution .",
    "informally , a _ test - set _ for the family of integer programs @xmath62 is a finite collection of integer vectors , called _",
    "test vectors _ , with the property that any non - optimal feasible solution to any integer program in this class can be improved ( in objective value ) by subtracting a test vector from it .",
    "test - sets for the family @xmath62 were first introduced by graver @xcite .",
    "graver s test set , called a _ graver basis _ in the literature , is typically not a minimal test set .    a simple but helpful characterization of the tdi property in terms of the hilbert basis property of regular subdivisions has been provided by schrijver @xcite . we prove another elementary characterization in section  [ sec : tdi ] whose simplified version is the following :    * theorem  [ thm : equivalences ] * _ the system @xmath31 is tdi if and only if @xmath2 is a hilbert basis , and there exists a test - set for @xmath62 with all test vectors having positive entries equal to @xmath0 and this positive support indexes either a linearly independent set or a minimally linear dependent set of columns of @xmath2 . _    establishing this theorem , some of its corollaries ( see section  [ sec : tdi ] ) have led us to three relevant earlier results that have been found in contexts different from ours , independently of one another :    * applegate , cook & mccormick s result ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2 ) which states that if @xmath2 is a hilbert basis then @xmath31 is tdi if @xmath14 has an integer optimum for every constraint vector @xmath63 that is a sum of linearly independent columns of @xmath2",
    ". however , our test - sets and their use for optimizing on ip are new .",
    "* hoten and sturmfels result ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.1 ) is stated in a computer algebra context , but the special case when the gap is @xmath64 can be seen to be equivalent to the above statement of theorem  [ thm : equivalences ] . however , it is still easier to prove each of these two independent results in their own terms , directly . *",
    "eisenbrand and shmonin @xcite proved hoten and sturmfels result in an elementary way , yet in the context of a generalization of integer programming called `` parametric integer programming '' .",
    "however , this work also uses more involved machinery than we do here .",
    "in addition , none of these works characterizes the tdi property in terms of test - sets or solving the underlying integer programs in fixed dimension without using lenstra s algorithm .",
    "as previously noted in @xcite , this allows us to deduce shortly cook , lovsz & schrijver s result @xcite on testing for the tdi property in fixed dimension , when given the conditions of theorem  [ thm : equivalences ] .",
    "another virtue of theorem  [ thm : equivalences ] is a useful reformulation to polynomial ideals : it generalizes a well - known algebraic result proved by sturmfels ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 8.9 ) relating toric initial ideals to unimodular triangulations .",
    "the basic connections between integer programming and computational algebra , knowledge of which will not be assumed here , was initiated by conti and traverso @xcite and further studied from various viewpoints in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "if @xmath2 is a matrix whose first @xmath65 submatrix is a @xmath38 matrix and whose last @xmath66 submatrix is @xmath67 , and @xmath27 is all @xmath0 except for the last @xmath3 coordinates which are @xmath64 , then @xmath15 is called a _ set packing problem _ , and @xmath19 a _ set packing polytope_. in section  [ sec : perfect ] we show that the converse of the following fact ( explained at the end of section  [ sec : tdi ] ) holds for normal fans of integral set packing polytopes : _ if @xmath68 are such that @xmath56 is a refinement of @xmath48 , where @xmath56 is a unimodular triangulation , then @xmath69 is tdi . _ in general , the converse does not hold and the most that is known in this direction is the existence of just one full dimensional subset of the columns of @xmath2 which is unimodular @xcite .",
    "not even a `` unimodular covering '' of a hilbert basis may be possible @xcite .",
    "however , the converse does hold for normal fans of integral set packing polytopes .",
    "more precisely , the main result of section  [ sec : perfect ] is the following :    * theorem  [ thm : perfect ] * _ given a set - packing problem defined by @xmath2 and @xmath27 , @xmath19 has integer vertices if and only if there exists @xmath70 such that @xmath55 is a refinement of the normal fan @xmath71 of @xmath19 , where @xmath55 is a unimodular triangulation .",
    "_    the proof relies on the basic idea of fulkerson s famous `` pluperfect graph theorem '' @xcite stating that the integrality of such polyhedra implies their total dual integrality in a very simple `` greedy '' way .",
    "chandrasekaran and tamir @xcite and cook , fonlupt and schrijver @xcite exploited fulkerson s method by pointing out its lexicographic or advantageous carath ' eodory feature . in @xcite",
    "it is noticed with the same method that the active rows of the dual of integral set packing polyhedra ( the cells of their normal fan ) have a unimodular subdivision , which can be rephrased as follows : _ the normal fan of integral set packing polyhedra has a unimodular refinement .",
    "_ however , the proof of the regularity of such a refinement appears for the first time in the present work .",
    "these results offer four methods for recognizing tdi systems , explained , illustrated and compared to previously known ones as well , in section  [ sec : computation ] .",
    "particular attention will be given to the recognition of integral set packing polytopes in practice , through theorem  [ thm : perfect ] above , and by using computational algebra packages like macaulay 2 .",
    "( not in polynomial time , but in a usefully implementable way ) .",
    "the first is based merely on theorem  [ thm : equivalences ] partly mentioned above , or more exactly on a reformulation of the test - sets to the language of polynomial ideals ( see ( v ) of the theorem in section  [ sec : tdi ] ) .",
    "then test - sets can be used to solve the related integer programs as well .",
    "this method has not yet been implemented .",
    "the other method has to be restricted to the generic case , and can make use of well developed objects of computational algebra ( see ( vi ) in section  [ sec : tdi ] ) .",
    "this method can also handle arbitrary set packing polytopes through theorem  [ thm : perfect ] above .",
    "the method has been implemented for set packing polytopes : the computations can be carried using computational packages like macaulay 2 .",
    "in this section we provide some new characterizations of tdi systems .",
    "we show the equivalence of five properties , three polyhedral ( one of them is the tdi property ) and two concern polynomial ideals .",
    "a third property is also equivalent to these in the generic case .    while the proofs of the equivalences of the three polyhedral properties use merely polyhedral arguments , the last among them ",
    "( iii )  has an appealing reformulation into the language of polynomial ideals .",
    "therefore , we start this section by introducing the necessary background on polynomial ideals ; namely , toric ideals , their initial ideals and gr \" obner bases .",
