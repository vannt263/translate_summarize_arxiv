    "there are three distinct types of solar wind identified by @xcite .",
    "first , there is relatively high coronal electron temperature wind originating from loops in the streamer stalk region @xcite .",
    "second , there is solar wind from the outside of this region .",
    "this wind includes coronal hole wind that has relatively low coronal electron temperatures and high wind speeds , as well as slower solar wind with lower coronal electron temperatures than the stream stalk region .",
    "the third type of solar wind is the transient interplanetary coronal mass ejections ( icmes ) which are caused by the coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) @xcite .",
    "the streamer stalk region is the narrow region in the middle of the streamer belt , which has the highest density fluctuations and the lowest solar wind speeds @xcite .",
    "@xcite provide observational evidence that the streamer stalks can be the coronal sources of the slow solar wind .",
    "@xcite suggests that slow solar wind originates from regions of rapidly expanding flux - tubes located above small coronal holes and at the boundaries of the large polar holes .",
    "based on a comparison of solar remote and in - situ observations , @xcite suggests that low - speed wind with higher @xmath2 ratios may originate from open fields in or near active regions .",
    "fisk and collaborators ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that reconnection between open and closed field lines releases material to form the solar wind .",
    "this model provides a reasonable explanation for the differences between fast and slow solar wind .",
    "the distribution of the three types of wind varies with the solar cycle . at solar minimum ,",
    "the coronal holes concentrate at both poles and high latitude coronal hole wind is observed @xcite .",
    "the heliospheric current sheet is flat and lies near the equatorial plane , and the streamer belt stalk wind occurs in a band around the current sheet @xcite .",
    "the icme rate is roughly proportional to the solar activity levels and therefore is very low at solar minimum @xcite . at solar maximum ,",
    "the current sheet tilts to high latitudes , and the streamer - stalk wind , which still occurs in a band around the current sheet , now can reach high latitudes .",
    "the polar coronal holes shrink , resulting in less coronal hole wind in the heliosphere .",
    "the increasing rate of icmes can temporarily enhance the open magnetic flux of the sun .",
    "subsequently , interchange reconnection between the large icmes loops and the open field of the sun eliminates the increased magnetic flux @xcite .",
    "further , there is no compelling observational evidence to suggest that disconnection of open magnetic flux occurs at the heliospheric current sheet @xcite .",
    "hence , the expectation was , prior to this solar minimum , the open magnetic flux would return to a constant background level , as it had in previous minima @xcite .",
    "in the current solar minimum , both the open magnetic flux and the mass flux of the solar wind are reduced compared to any previous solar minimum for which there are good space observations . in this paper , we offer a possible explanation for the decrease in open magnetic flux in the current minimum .",
    "we point out that the streamer - belt - stalk - associated wind originates from a narrower region in the current solar minimum compared to the previous one , and thus the region outside the streamer belt stalk region is larger .",
    "when we calculate the increase in area outside the stalk region , we find it is equal and opposite to the decrease in open magnetic flux , suggesting that the total magnetic flux in the region outside the stalk region remains constant in each solar minimum .",
    "the implication for the transport models of open flux developed by fisk and colleagues is then discussed .",
    "the _ ulysses _ 18-year mission started in 1991 @xcite and terminated in 2009 , providing sufficient data to compare the different conditions in the two minima . here",
    "we use the data from the year of 1995.07 - 1998.2 ( carrington rotation 1892 - 1933 ) at last minimum and 2005.83 - 2008.96 ( carrington rotation 2036 - 2077 ) at the current minimum and compare the difference .",
    "as shown in figure [ figure1 ] , the radial component of the heliospheric magnetic field , the so - called open magnetic flux of the sun ( @xmath3 ) , decreases by 35.4% ; @xmath2 , @xmath4 , and fe / o all decrease by 61.5% , 66.2% and 10.1% , respectively . especially , when considering the region outside of the streamer stalk ( as identified later ) , we find the open magnetic flux decreased by 30% .     , @xmath2 , @xmath5 , and fe / o at the previous ( black ) and the current ( dotted ) minimum from _",

    "fisk and colleagues developed a model for the global transport of open magnetic flux on the sun , which is illustrated in figure [ figure3]a @xcite .",
    "differential rotation drives the open flux across the polar coronal hole and then into closed field regions where open flux does not disconnect at the current sheet , but rather the flow patterns turn as shown .",
    "the process by which the magnetic field is transported through the closed field region is diffusion due to reconnection with loops .",
    "this model accounts for a number of features of the observed behavior of open magnetic flux ; e.g. , the slow solar wind appears to come from large coronal loops outside of coronal holes , and be released by reconnection @xcite .",
    "-axis is the solar rotation axis .",
    "p marks the open line ( green ) that connects to the pole .",
    "the curves with arrows ( red ) are the trajectories of the open field lines , and the yellow region is the streamer stalk region .",
    "( b)the open lines reconnects and diffuses outside the streamer stalk region . , title=\"fig : \" ] +    this picture now needs to be revised , as shown in figure [ figure3]b .",
    "the open magnetic flux in regions outside the streamer - stalk region is unable to penetrate into this region .",
    "thus , disconnection of this component of open flux , which must occur at the heliospheric current sheet , is not possible .",
    "rather , the turning of the flow patterns of open flux must occur outside the streamer stalk region , as shown .",
    "the total open magnetic flux outside of the streamer - stalk region , which can not now disconnect , is conserved , as is observed to be the case .",
    "there are several points worth emphasizing .",
    "the signature we use to identify our streamer - belt - stalk wind is the @xmath2 ratio , or the inferred coronal electron temperature , not the solar wind speed , as was used in other studies .",
    "moreover , it is important to note that the streamer - stalk wind is not the entire slow speed solar wind .",
    "rather , it is only the very slow , high coronal electron temperature wind , which we identify as originating from the streamer stalk underlying the heliospheric current sheet .",
    "there is a broader slow solar wind region @xcite , as constrained by the black dotted line in figure [ figure3]b .",
    "the conservation of the total magnetic flux in the non - streamer - stalk region during the two solar minima suggests that the open magnetic field of the sun in the current solar minimum is behaving as it did in previous minima , the only difference being the width of the streamer belt stalk region , which controls the magnetic field strength in the region outside the streamer belt stalk region .    this work was supported in part by nasa headquarters under the nasa earth and space science fellowship program - grant nnx09av13h , by the heliophysics theory program , by nasa / jpl contract 1268016 , and by nsf grant atm 0632471"
