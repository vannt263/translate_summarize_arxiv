    "certainly the most widely used exact solution of the einstein equations is that of spherically symmetric inhomogeneous dust , often referred to as the lematre - tolman ( lt ) ( and sometimes as the lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) ) model .",
    "one can find very detailed discussions of these solutions in some modern texts @xcite .",
    "there is a very extensive application of these models in cosmology @xcite , and their use in the study of nakedly singular gravitational collapse goes back at least 35 years @xcite . for general discussions of these models see @xcite , the earlier text @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "there are many more recent discussions .",
    "the evolution of radial profiles ( which is not of primary concern here ) see @xcite , and for various considerations of gravitational entropy ( which are of interest here ) see @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting applications of the lt models in cosmology is the reproduction of observables of the @xmath0cdm model without @xmath0 .",
    "the lt models that do this have central density cusps @xcite .",
    "naturally , such behavior elicits two points of view : the density profiles are unphysical @xcite , and the density profiles are just fine @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present communication is to examine the role that the central density profiles play in gravitational collapse . whereas the usual treatment of the lt models involves coordinates @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is some radial coordinate , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the usual angular coordinates , and @xmath5 is the proper time along the geodesic streamlines of the fluid , it is necessary for the present discussion ( as explained below ) to switch to coordinates @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the effective gravitation mass @xcite .",
    "for clarity , the solution is developed from first principles in the next section ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "starting with einstein s equations @xcite @xmath8 where the @xmath9 are tangent to the generators of the geodesic flow , we consider only positive definite energy densities @xmath10 , and use comoving synchronous coordinates so that @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the metric of a unit two - sphere , which we write in the usual form @xmath13 , and we assume the existence of an origin defined by @xmath14 ( and all @xmath5 derivatives of @xmath14 ) .",
    "the generators of the flow are @xmath15 and the radial normals are @xmath16 so that @xmath17 and @xmath18 . from @xmath19",
    "we find @xmath20 where @xmath21 is an arbitrary function ( @xmath22 ) . for convenience ,",
    "take @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the riemann tensor and so @xmath25 is the ( invariantly defined ) effective gravitational mass @xcite .",
    "we obtain @xmath26 @xcite , with @xmath7 given by @xmath27 to solve einstein s equations we integrate ( [ rdot ] ) ( see below ) .",
    "the lt solutions have two independent invariants derivable from the riemann tensor without differentiation .",
    "these can be taken to be @xmath28 and @xmath29 where @xmath24 is the ricci scalar and @xmath30 is the first weyl invariant ( @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the weyl tensor ) .    from ( [ rdot ] ) and ( [ ricci ] )",
    "we arrive at @xmath33 from ( [ rho ] ) we have @xmath34 further , it follows immediately from ( [ rdot ] ) ( assuming , of course , some non - vanishing interval in @xmath5 such that @xmath35 ) that @xmath36 we are interested in the avoidance of naked singularities , and since these can only arise at @xmath37 @xcite , we take @xmath38 , and consider @xmath39 an inessential complication to the considerations presented here @xcite . in the cosmological context , @xmath39 is an essential consideration .",
    "it is clear from ( [ ricci ] ) and ( [ rho ] ) that scalar polynomial singularities occur for @xmath40 a  bang \" ( or  crunch \" ) occurs for @xmath41 .",
    "shell crossing singularities occur for @xmath42 .",
    "the conditions for their avoidance are well known .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .    for explicit expressions",
    "we now integrate ( [ rdot ] ) with @xmath38 to obtain @xmath43^{2/3},\\ ] ] and so @xmath44^{2/3}},\\ ] ]    @xmath45    and @xmath46 now @xmath5 has the freedom of a linear transformation and we restrict part of that freedom by setting @xmath47 .",
    "we have @xmath48 we take @xmath5 increasing to the future .",
    "the model is non - singular for @xmath49 .",
    "the singularity ( @xmath50 ) starts at @xmath51 and propagates out to larger @xmath7 according to @xmath52 shell crossing singularities ( @xmath53 ) start at @xmath51 and propagate out to larger @xmath7 according to @xmath54 to ensure that @xmath55 for @xmath56 we take @xmath57 for @xmath56 and so the streamlines of constant @xmath7 , which can not be propagated through @xmath58 , never reach @xmath59 for @xmath56 . to ensure that @xmath60 for @xmath56 we need @xmath61 and so for the models considered here @xmath60 everywhere for @xmath56 as long as @xmath62 and so @xmath63 must be concave up for @xmath56 .",
    "it is well known that both branches of the radial null geodesics converge for @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "the apparent horizon locus ( @xmath65 ) is therefore given by @xmath66 since @xmath67 for @xmath56 the singularity at @xmath58 for @xmath56 is not visible @xcite .",
    "however , for @xmath37 , @xmath68 , and so there exists the possibility that radial null geodesics propagate from the singularity at @xmath51 to larger @xmath7 .",
    "since @xmath69 , in order to avoid null geodesics propagating from @xmath51 we need @xmath70 .",
    "we therefore have a sufficient local condition for the formation of a black hole @xcite : @xmath71 the sufficient global condition for the global visibility of the singularity at @xmath51 is given by @xcite @xmath72",
    "from ( [ rho1 ] ) it follows that @xmath73 from ( [ bh ] ) and ( [ central ] ) then the sufficient condition for the formation of a black hole can be stated as @xmath74 and from ( [ global ] ) and ( [ central ] ) @xmath75 is a sufficient condition for the global visibility of the singularity . note that because of the freedom that remains in @xmath5 , ( [ central])-([sns ] ) are indeterminate up to a multiplication factor @xmath76 , where @xmath76 is a constant @xmath77 .",
    "this is of no consequence here as @xmath76 can be set by explicit choice of @xmath78 in ( [ rho2 ] ) .",
    "let us now compare the points of view given in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "( in @xcite an extra derivative was taken in order to obtain the invariant @xmath79 , upon which the arguments are based @xcite , as an undefined radial coordinate @xmath2 ( undefined in the sense of a gauge transformation ) was used .",
    "this extra derivative is unnecessary here as @xmath80 is already invariantly defined . )",
    "whereas the physical context here is different , the basic physical model is the same ( by time inversion ) and the basic physical arguments should apply . according to @xcite",
    ", @xmath81 should be @xmath82 .",
    "this automatically wipes out the entire subject matter of shell focusing singularities as follows immediately from ( [ bh ] ) .",
    "the point of view of @xcite would allow the development of shell focusing singularities , in principle .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in the cosmological context , whereas the lt model can be used to interpret current observations , there is no suggestion that the model should be used at early times .",
    "in contrast , in the collapsing counterpart , it would seem unreasonable to push the model all the way to the singularity , where all the interest lies , due to the equation of state . since we are interested in matters of principle here , this line of argument will not be pursued .",
    "the usual starting point for considerations like those given here is @xmath83 at first sight , it would appear that the development given here ( in terms of @xmath7 ) is unnecessary .",
    "one need only introduce a suitably smooth transformation @xmath84 , which is one way to set the gauge freedom in ( [ metricr ] ) .",
    "however , the arguments given here involve two distinct types of relations : relations like ( [ central ] ) which involve derivatives on both sides of the equation , and relations like ( [ bh ] ) which do not .",
    "the first type allow a smooth transformation from @xmath7 to @xmath2 as the independent variable .",
    "the latter do not .",
    "let us write @xmath85 as any of @xmath86 or @xmath65 . then since @xmath87 any information contained in @xmath88 is lost .",
    "for example , from ( [ bh ] ) we have @xmath89 as the sufficient local condition for the formation of a black hole . relying on ( [ bhr ] ) , we might draw the erroneous ( and entropically unfavorable ) global conclusion that black holes in the lt model must have a constant bang time @xcite . in figure 1 , i construct a simple counterexample to any such claim by considering @xmath90 , a case both @xcite and @xcite would accept .",
    "by using the effective gravitational mass as a coordinate in the lt solutions , a local sufficient condition for the development of a black hole has been given .",
    "this condition allows and invariantly defined non - vanishing range in central density cusps , the central feature of the lt solutions when used to match cosmological observations without invoking the cosmological constant .",
    "if one demands no density cusps in the initial conditions , then we have shown that the lt models never produce even locally naked singularities .",
