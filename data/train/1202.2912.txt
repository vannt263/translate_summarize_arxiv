    "the regularity theory for non - collapsed einstein manifolds has attracted many studies in last two decades , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite etc .",

    "moreover , @xmath5 is a @xmath18-smooth metric .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath19 is an einstein manifold , then the convergence to @xmath7 restricted to @xmath9 is actually in the @xmath20-topology and @xmath5 is a smooth einstein metric in @xmath9 because of the regularity results from the pde theory .",

    "our study is analogous to the standard regularity problem in studying weak solutions for pdes . in the case of the einstein equation , because of its invariance under diffeomorphisms , there is not a good notion of weak solutions .",
    "therefore , we first need to make clear what we mean by einstein metrics in the weak sense . now let us introduce the notion of almost einstein manifolds we want to study .",
