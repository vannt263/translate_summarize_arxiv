    "the development of compact , orthogonal wavelets@xcite represents one of the most significant advances in signal processing from recent times@xcite .",
    "like well established methods based on fourier analysis , wavelets can be employed to obtain a compressed representation of spatially or temporally correlated data , and thus have found significant applications in image , audio and video compression @xcite . by providing a multi - resolution analysis , a wt can capture correlations over many different length / time scales , which is key to their usefulness in practical applications .    similarly , multi - scale methods , in the context of the renormalization group ( rg ) @xcite , which provides a systematic framework to implement changes of scale in many body systems , have also had a long and successful history in the context of condensed matter physics and quantum field theories .",
    "a recent advance in rg methods for quantum many - body systems is the multi - scale entanglement renormalization ansatz ( mera)@xcite , where quantum many - body wavefunctions are represented as circuits comprised of local unitary gates . by properly encoding correlations at all length scales , mera have been demonstrated to be particularly useful in the numerical investigation of quantum many - body systems where many scales of length are important , such as in systems at the critical point of a phase transition@xcite .",
    "while the conceptual links between wts and the rg have been previously examined@xcite , more recently it was shown that a wt acting in the space of fermionic mode operators corresponds precisely to a mera@xcite .",
    "this wavelet / mera connection proved useful in allowing construction of the first known analytic mera for a critical system , and may further prove useful in understanding e.g. the scaling of errors in mera .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to take the connection the other way , and examine whether the tools and ideas developed in the context of the mera are useful in the understanding and design of wts .",
    "specifically , we discuss the use of unitary circuits for the representation of standard families of dyadic wavelets ( including daubechies wavelets , coiflets and symlets ) , and then explore use of unitary circuits for the design of novel wavelet families ( including symmetric wavelets of dilation factor @xmath0 and @xmath1 , symmetric multiwavelets , boundary wavelets , and a new family of symmetric biorthogonal wavelets ) .",
