    "scandium trifluoride ( scf@xmath0 ) is a promising material attracted much attention due to recently discovered strong negative thermal expansion ( nte ) coefficient over a wide range of temperatures from 10 to 1100  k @xcite .    at atmospheric pressure scf@xmath0",
    "has cubic ( space group @xmath2 ) reo@xmath0-type structure ( fig .",

    "however , opposite to the metallic reo@xmath0 , which has very week nte effect @xcite , scandium trifluoride is an insulator with band gap of more than 8  ev @xcite .",
    "a cubic - to - rhombohedral phase transition occurs in scf@xmath0 at high pressure ( @xmath3@xmath40.5  gpa at @xmath5@xmath6300  k or @xmath3=0.10.2  gpa at 50  k ) as determined from x - ray and neutron diffraction studies @xcite .",
    "raman spectroscopy confirms that upon pressure increase cubic scf@xmath0 undergo a phase transition to the rhombohedral ( space group @xmath7 ) phase @xcite .",
    "the electronic structure of scf@xmath0 thin films has been investigated by means of resonant photoemission spectroscopy at the sc 2@xmath8 and f 1@xmath1 absorption edges in ref .",
    "two charge - transfer - type satellites , the first one at about 13  ev below the main peaks in the valence - band and the second one with an energy separation of about 910  ev , were observed and indicate the strong hybridization effect between sc 3@xmath9 and f 2@xmath8 states @xcite .",

    "it was shown that a description of nte within the quasi - harmonic approximation is not reliable in the case of scf@xmath0 .",
    "the authors in @xcite have demonstrated that the @xmath10 mode ( the one with the lowest energy at @xmath11-point of brillouin zone ( bz ) ) has quartic potential and proposed the mechanism for nte based on this anharmonicity .",
    "the transition between the ground state and the first excited state ( @xmath619  mev ) of the @xmath10 mode has been associated with experimentally observed phonon peak ( @xmath625  mev ) , which stiffens upon increasing temperature @xcite .    in spite of mainly experimental efforts",

    "in this study scf@xmath0 is modeled by means of two different methods : ( i ) lcao within the framework of hybrid density functional approach and ( ii ) paw calculations using the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) density functional .    to perform hybrid lcao calculations , we used the periodic crystal09 code @xcite , which employs gaussian - type functions centered on atomic nuclei as the basis set for expansion of the crystalline orbitals .",

    "dft calculations using the paw method as implemented in the vasp code @xcite were performed for comparison .",
    "we have compared pw91 @xcite and pbe @xcite exchange - correlation potentials as well as large - core effective core potential ( lc - ecp ) with three 3@xmath174@xmath18 valence electrons and small - core effective core potential ( sc - ecp ) with eleven 3@xmath183@xmath193@xmath174@xmath18 valence electrons for sc atom .",

    "until now the band gap of scf@xmath26 was not precisely measured experimentally , but it is estimated to be larger than 78  ev @xcite .",
    "all hybrid functionals constructed for lcao method ( @xmath27hf corresponds to @xmath23=4.026   , see fig .  [",

    "the band gap is underestimated as it is predicted by the theory for pure gga functionals : it is equal to 5.56.0  ev .",
    "hybrid paw calculations allowed us to obtain @xmath25 equal to 89  ev , which is closer to the experimental estimate .",
    "thus , for electronic structure calculations we have finally chosen the `` pbesol & pbesol '' functional with @xmath27hf=18% , giving @xmath25=9.8  ev , for lcao method and the pw91 functional with @xmath27hf=25% , giving @xmath25=8.9  ev , for paw method .",

    "@xcite and the f 1@xmath1 x - ray absorption spectrum taken from ref .",
    "the vb photoelectron spectrum of scf@xmath0 has a complex shape composed of the main peak and the shoulder located at the left side , which originate due to the valence band splitting upon hybridization of the f 2@xmath8 and sc 3@xmath9 states @xcite .",
    "our theoretical calculations confirm such interpretation and reproduce well the width and asymmetric shape of the valence band .",
    "the f 1@xmath1 absorption spectrum @xcite consists of three well visible peaks at 9.3 , 11.4 and 18.2  ev due to transitions from the f 1@xmath1 core state to the f n@xmath8 states in the conduction band and above .",
    "the first two peaks correspond to the f 2@xmath8 states in the conduction band , which are hybridized with the sc 3@xmath9 states .",
    "the two peaks originate from the @xmath32-@xmath33 splitting of the sc 3@xmath9 states by the octahedral crystal field .",
    "the third peak at 18.2  ev corresponds to the interaction of the f 2@xmath8 and sc 4@xmath8 states .",
    "such interpretation is fully supported by the calculated f @xmath8 dos : in fact , good agreement with the f 1@xmath1 absorption spectrum indicates that a relaxation of the electron states due to the f 1@xmath1 core - hole is weak in scf@xmath0 .",
    "the lattice constant , band gap and electronic properties of cubic scf@xmath26 were calculated using lcao and paw dft computational methods .",
    "it was shown that a variation of exact hf exchange part allowed us to reproduce experimental value of the lattice constant @xmath23=4.026    @xcite .",

    "calculated partial f @xmath8 dos is in a good agreement with valence - band photoelectron @xcite and f 1@xmath1 x - ray absorption @xcite spectra .",
