    "since the seminal work of lequeux et al .",
    "( 1979 ) , the relationship between luminosity ( _ l _ ) and metallicity ( _ z _ ; hereafter _ l - z _  relation ) , two crucial parameters for understanding the behavior of galaxies , has been extensively studied ( e.g. skillman et al .",
    "1989 ; tremonti et al .",
    "metallicity reflects the gas reprocessed by stars and any exchange of gas between environments and galaxies , while stellar mass ( i.e. luminosity for constant mass - to - light ratio ) reflects the amount of gas locked up into stars .",
    "therefore , the relationship between luminosity and metallicity can provide an important constraint on the models of galaxy formation and evolution that attempt to account for the chemical evolution of the system ( see e.g. , prantzos & boissier 2000 ; boissier et al .",
    "2003 ; qian & wasserburg 2004 ) .",
    "additionally , the _ l - z _",
    "relation could be also used to search for the most metal - poor galaxies and to derive , at least to a first approximation , the distance of a galaxy from its metallicity and vice versa .    a well - defined correlation between the blue luminosity ( @xmath2 ) and the metallicity for dwarf irregulars ( dis ) , spirals and ellipticals has been established by various authors ( e.g. , garnett & shields 1987 ; skillman et al . 1989 ; zaritsky et al . 1994 ; melbourne & salzer 2002 ; lee et al .",
    "2003 ; lamareille et al .",
    "2004 ; tremonti et al .",
    "2004 ; salzer et al . 2005",
    "; van zee & haynes 2006 ) , over @xmath310 mag in luminosity and 2 dex in metallicity .",
    "however , some studies do not support these results for all types of galaxies . specially , several contradictory results regarding the existence of an _",
    "l - z _  relationship of dwarf galaxies have been presented over years .",
    "hidalgo - gmez & olofsson ( 1998 ) presented a weaker _ l - z _",
    "relationship than previously thought , between @xmath4 and o / h for dis .",
    "hunter & hoffman ( 1999 ; hereafter hh99 ) found that the relationship between @xmath4 and o / h for i m , sm and blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcds ) has a very large scatter .",
    "another question is whether the _",
    "relationship for dwarf galaxies ( if it is true ) exists in a similar manner as for massive galaxies . using a sample of more than 500 star - forming galaxies , melbourne & salzer ( 2002 ) found that the _ l - z _",
    "relation for giant galaxies has less scatter and is steeper than that for dwarf galaxies ( also see salzer et al . 2005 ) . using @xmath31000 individual spectra of hii  regions in 54 late - type galaxies , however , pilyugin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found that the slope of the _ l - z _",
    "relationship for spirals ( @xmath5 mag ) is slightly shallower than the one for dis ( @xmath6 mag ) , which is consistent with the result for blue compact galaxies ( bcgs ; shi et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "bcds are a group of extragalactic objects that are spectroscopically characterized by a faint , blue optical continuum accompanied , in most cases , by intense emission lines .",
    "bcds are small galaxies with low metallicities ( @xmath7 ; hh99 ) and have dramatically different properties compared to normal dwarf galaxies ( zwicky 1966 ; gil de paz et al .",
    "these galaxies have bluer colors than ordinary dis and their surface brightness is much higher . accumulated observational evidence over the recent years provided more details on the unique properties of these galaxies ( for a review see kunth & stlin 2000 ) . having a relatively low metallicity ,",
    "bcds are at an early epoch of their evolution , making them similar to samples of the distant , more massive protogalaxies , thus allowing us to study the star formation and chemical enrichment in an environment likely to be similar to that in the early universe .",
    "although it is thought the _",
    "relationship should exist in almost all types of galaxies , it is not clear yet whether this relationship holds for bcds alone ( hh99 , fig . 7 ; hopkins et al .",
    "2002 , fig . 7 ) .",
    "vaduvescu et al .",
    "( 2007 ) show that there exists a good correlation between the metallicity and the @xmath0 luminosity for bcds .",
    "however , results from these authors may suffer large uncertainties from the limited size of their bcd sample ( 13 , 22 and 14 galaxies in hh99 , hopkins et al . and vaduvescu et al .",
    ", respectively ) , and/or the selection criteria for bcds , as well as the inconsistence in the determination of metallicity for different objects . therefore , further works are needed to disentangle these two apparently contradictory results .    in this paper , we present our systemic studies on the _ l - z _  relationships for bcds from the optical to the near - infrared ( nir ) , i.e. at the _ b_- , _ r_- and _ @xmath0_-band . our bcd sample is derived from the data in gil de paz et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and it contains @xmath8 galaxies ( 40 of which have nir photometry ) which is about 6 times larger than the one used in previous studies of dwarf galaxies .",
    "the nir data are useful to study the _",
    "l - z _  relation because they are less affected by the ongoing star formation activities , and they also suffer significantly less from dust extinctions ( both external and internal ) . moreover , the @xmath0 luminosity is a more reliable measurement of the stellar mass in these galaxies ( gil de paz 2000 ; prez - gonzlez et al .",
    "2003 ) . hence",
    ", the study of @xmath9-@xmath10 relationship allows us to tie the observed variations in metal abundance to stellar mass , one of the most fundamental physical parameters of galaxies .",
    "however , there are only few works ( salzer et al .",
    "2005 ; mendes de oliveira et al . 2006 ; vaduvescu et al .",
    "2007 ) studying the _ l - z _",
    "relation in the nir due to the lack of photometric data .",
    "the paper is organized as following : section 2 describes the sample of bcds and data reductions . in ",
    "3 we first derive the oxygen abundances for a subsample of bcd galaxies which have sdss spectroscopical observations , and then we evaluate the _",
    "b- , r- _ and _ @xmath0_-band _ l - z _  diagrams .",
    "we compare our results with previous work , discuss the slopes of our _ l - z _  relations and explore the possible origins of the scatter in the _ l - z _  relation in  4 . in the last section ,",
    "a brief summary is present .",
    "there have been a number of criteria for selecting bcds .",
    "these criteria are commonly based on the galaxy s morphological properties and its luminosity ( zwicky & zwicky 1971 ; thuan & martin 1981 ) , although some definitions are based on their spectroscopic properties ( gallego et al .",
    "bcds classified by these different criteria may be confused with each other ( gil de paz et al .",
    "however , for our purpose , i.e. to determine the _ l - z _  relationship , a clear and homogeneous sample of blue compact dwarf galaxies is necessary .    using a unified concept of bcd galaxy , gil de paz et al .",
    "( 2003 ) compiled a bcd sample ( including 104 members ) from several exploratory studies .",
    "the galaxies in their sample were selected by putting forward a new set of quantitative classification criteria .",
    "this new set of criteria is a combination of the galaxy s color , morphology and luminosity .",
    "briefly , a bcd galaxy has to fulfill the following three criteria ( referring to _ blue , compact _ and _ dwarf _ , respectively ) : ( 1 ) @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the peak surface brightness of _ b_- and _ r_-band , respectively , ( 2 ) @xmath14 mag arcsec@xmath15 , and ( 3 ) the absolute magnitude @xmath16 mag [ see gil de paz et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for details ] .",
    "such a large and universal sample allows us to measure an unbiased _",
    "relation for bcds .    in this work ,",
    "we select bcd galaxies from the gil de paz s sample , which is the largest well - defined sample of bcds .",
    "since not all galaxies have their metallicities measured , a galaxy is selected if ( 1 ) we can get its oxygen abundance from literature , or ( 2 ) its [ nii]@xmath17/h@xmath18 ratio was given in the original sample , or ( 3 ) we can obtain a spectrum from sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; gunn et al . 1998 ; blanton et al .",
    "2003 ) data release six ( dr6 ) .    to derive the oxygen abundances for galaxies which have sdss spectra , we need to measure the fluxes of emission - lines accurately .",
    "thus we have to correct both the galactic reddening and the underlying stellar absorption .",
    "the detailed method for the latter process can be found in zhao et al .",
    "( 2009 ; in preparation ) .",
    "we only give a brief description here .",
    "first , the observed spectra were dereddened for galactic extinction , using the extinction coefficients from schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and the empirical extinction law from cardelli et al .",
    "then we model the stellar contribution through the stellar population synthesis code , starlight version 2.0 ( cid fernandes et al . 2004 ) . after subtracting the best - fit model spectrum from the observed one",
    ", we obtain the  pure \" emission - line spectrum , from which we could measure accurate fluxes for all emission lines with the _ onedspec.splot _ task in iraf .",
    "the line flux errors are typically less than 5% .",
    "finally , the observed line intensities were corrected for the intrinsic extinctions from the equation @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the intrinsic line flux , @xmath21 is the observed line flux , @xmath22 is the logarithmic reddening parameter and @xmath23 is the redding function ( cardelli et al .",
    "for the intrinsic hydrogen line intensity ratios , we used the theoretical ratios from brocklehurst ( 1971 ) at electron temperature and number density estimated from the observed [ oiii]@xmath244959,5007/@xmath25 ratio and [ sii]@xmath26/@xmath27 ratio , respectively ( see  3.1 for detail ) .",
    "the photometric data for the optical bands are adopted from gil de paz et al .",
    "the nir data used here are mainly taken from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) extended source catalog ( jarrett et al .",
    "2000 ) . for several objects",
    "the @xmath0 magnitudes are adopted from noeske et al .",
    "( 2003 ; 2005 ) and vaduvescu et al .",
    "because of the relatively shallower observations of 2mass , we prefer using the data from the later two sources to using the data from 2mass when overlapping sources are found .",
    "generally , the o / h ratio is used to study the _",
    "relationship since it is easily attained in the optical part of the spectrum .",
    "the preferred method for determining the oxygen abundance in galaxies is through electron temperature - sensitive lines ( the so - called @xmath1 method ) , such as the [ oiii]@xmath244363 line ( aller 1984 ) .",
    "the main problem is that normally the [ oiii]@xmath244363 line is very weak and only appears in very high excitation spectra . when the [ oiii]@xmath244363 line is absent , some other empirical methods , such as the @xmath28 method ( pagel et al .",
    "1979 ) , the @xmath29 method ( pilyugin 2001 ) and the n2 method ( denicol et al . 2002 ) have been employed frequently .",
    "these methods do not need any direct measurement of the electron temperature .",
    "we used the formula given by izotov et al .",
    "( 2006 ) to determine the abundances for galaxies which have good signal - to - noise ratios for the [ oiii]@xmath244363 line . since the wavelength coverage of the sdss spectra is 3800 - 9300  , the [ oii]@xmath243727 lines are not available for the low redshift ( @xmath30 ) bcds used here .",
    "therefore , we used their equation ( 4 ) , which makes use of the [ oii]@xmath247320 , 7331 lines instead of the [ oii]@xmath243727 line , to calculate the ( o@xmath31/h ) . the formulae is given the form of @xmath32 where @xmath33[oiii ] , and @xmath34 . to calculate the ( o@xmath35/h ) , we used the equation ( 5 ) in izotov et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , as following @xmath36 the electron temperature ( @xmath1 ) and number density ( @xmath37 ) were derived with the iraf task _ nebular.zones _ ( de robertis et al .",
    "1987 ; shaw & dufour 1995 ) using the [ oiii]@xmath244363/@xmath38 ratio and the [ sii]@xmath26/@xmath27 ratio , respectively .",
    "this task is based on a five - level statistical equilibrium model and makes use of the latest collision strengths and radiative transition probabilities .",
    "for those we can not obtain the electron densities from the [ sii ] line ratio , we assumed a density of 100 @xmath39 .",
    "this assumption almost does not affect our oxygen abundance determination , since the effect of temperature is much larger than that of electron density .",
    "for 12 out of 24 bcds which have sdss spectroscopical observations , we ve measured the oxygen abundance using the @xmath1 method , which is presented in table 1 .    to study the _",
    "relation , we also compiled oxygen abundance determined by the @xmath1 method from the literature , as shown in column ( 6 ) of table 2 .",
    "when more than one data point for a galaxy can be found , we use the error - weighted average value . for galaxies we can not obtain errors of abundance from the original references ,",
    "an equal weighted mean value is adopted . the final error is the bigger one of the two values : half of the difference of the range in values and the propagated error .      the n2[@xmath40log([nii]@xmath246584/h@xmath18 ) ] empirical method is proposed by denicol et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , following the earlier work by storchi - bergmann et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and raimann et al .",
    "they used a representative sample of hii galaxies which have accurate oxygen abundances , plus photoionization models covering a wide range of abundances ( @xmath41 ) , to calibrate the n2 estimator .",
    "as shown in denicol et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , the oxygen abundance and the n2 calibrator are well correlated ( the correlation coefficient is 0.85 ) , and the linear relation holds for the whole metallicity range , from the most metal - poor to the most metal - rich galaxies in their sample .",
    "least - squares fits to the data simultaneously minimizing the errors in both axes , give @xmath42    the oxygen abundance determined based on this method has a precision of @xmath43 dex .",
    "the n2 parameter has clear observational advantages for ranking metallicities in star - forming galaxies .",
    "besides it being monotonic with log(o / h ) , it is also independent on reddening correction and flux calibration . what s more , for the bcds having sdss spectroscopic observations , the [ oii]@xmath243727 line , which is critical both for the @xmath28 method and the @xmath29 method , is not available in the spectra .",
    "in addition to the above reasons , we have another reason for using n2 method other than the @xmath29 or the @xmath28 method to derive the oxygen abundances for the bcd sample used in the current work",
    ". the [ nii]/h@xmath18 ratio of about 47% galaxies were given by gil de paz et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , thus this method allows us to collect more data points than the other methods .",
    "the oxygen abundances determined based on the n2 method are listed in table 1 ( for the sdss sample ) and column ( 7 ) of table 2 ( for the entire sample ) .",
    "in table 2 we list the _ b _ and _ r _ magnitudes , along with their errors , which are taken from gil de paz et al .",
    "the foreground galactic extinctions have been corrected for these galaxies using @xmath44 values determined following schlegel ( 1998 ) and the galactic extinction law of cardelli et al .",
    "the typical error in _",
    "b _ magnitude is less than 0.05 mag , while it is around 0.1 mag in the _ r_-band .    for the purpose of investigating the _ l - z _",
    "relation , we first display the broad band @xmath45 color versus the metal abundance ( derived by the @xmath1 method ) and the absolute _ b _ magnitude for our bcd sample , in the left and right panels of figure 1 , respectively . in the left panel , open circles represent objects without a given measurement error of the abundance .",
    "one sees expected / familiar trends in both plots : the galaxies tend toward redder colors in progressing from lower to higher luminosity or metallicity , meanwhile with the presence of large scatters .",
    "these large scatters are mainly attributed to the internal redding and the measurement error .",
    "we present the @xmath2-@xmath10 and @xmath46-@xmath10 relations in figures 2 and 3 respectively .",
    "open symbols represent the objects that the measurement errors of their abundances were not given in the referenced literature .",
    "however , the error will not affect our fitting results since we do not use it as a weighting .    in the left panel of figure 2",
    "we show the _ b_-band absolute magnitude plotted versus metallicity , which was determined based on the @xmath1 method .",
    "as we can see , a very good correlation is presented in the data .",
    "only two galaxies , mrk 328 and um 533 , which have the highest metallicities in the sample , might be discrepant from the trend . in order to check whether these two galaxies are really outliers",
    ", we calculated their deviations and found that both are less than 3@xmath47 .",
    "thus , these two points do nt really deviate from the trend .",
    "the apparent discrepancy may be caused by the fact that 1 ) the measurement error of the metallicity for um 533 is as large as 0.29 dex , 2 ) bcds with metallicity as high as @xmath48 are rare in our sample .",
    "a nonweighted least - squares linear fit , using a geometrical mean functional relationship ( isobe et al .",
    "1990 ) , to these 66 bcds gives @xmath49 the fitted trend is shown as a solid line in figure 2 .",
    "the rms deviation of the data from the relationship is 0.25 dex in ( o / h ) .",
    "the spearman rank correlation coefficient ( @xmath50 , assessing how well an arbitrary monotonic function could describe the relationship between two variables ) of the trend is -0.58 at a @xmath514@xmath47 level of significance , which indicates an anti - correlation between @xmath4 and o / h and means that the probability for the null hypothesis of no correlation between ( o / h)@xmath52 and @xmath4 is @xmath53 .",
    "the parameters of all fitting results presented in this section are summarized in table 3 .    in order to illustrate the effect of using different methods to compute the abundance on the _ l - z _",
    "relation , we plot the n2-based @xmath54-@xmath10 relation in the right panel of the figures for each band considered . with a bit bigger scatter , a similar relationship also presents in the right panel of figure 2 . excluding the labelled source , pox 4 ( its deviation is larger than 3@xmath47 ) , we obtain the following @xmath2-@xmath10 relation for the rest 73 bcds from a geometrical mean fitting @xmath55 the rms deviation of the data from the relationship is 0.30 dex in ( o / h ) .",
    "we can see that the @xmath1-based slope is in agreement with the n2-based slope within the uncertainty . however , as for the other two bands , the @xmath1-based slope is a bit smaller than the n2-based slope .",
    "we present a further discussion about this slope difference below .",
    "the situation changes a bit when coming to the longer wavelength photometric band , the _ r_-band . the trend becomes shallower and the scatter is a bit smaller . while pox 4 is still an outlier in this band .",
    "nonweighted least - squares linear fits to these two data sets give @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the @xmath1- and n2-based @xmath46-@xmath10 relations respectively .",
    "the reason why we would like to arrive at an @xmath9-@xmath10 relation is because such a relation should be more nearly representative of the more fundamental relationship between metal abundance and stellar mass .",
    "this is because the observed luminosity at the optical bands is dominated by recent star - formation activity rather than the stellar population that has accumulated over the galaxy s lifetime , while at the @xmath0-band the light is sensitive to the bulk of the stellar content .",
    "the _ @xmath9-z _ relationship displayed in figure 4 shows a change relative to the optical ones .",
    "the slope and scatter are much smaller than those of the @xmath2- and @xmath46-@xmath10 relations , which can be also seen in table 3 .",
    "this is especially true for the @xmath1-based results : the rms scatter of the _ @xmath9-z _",
    "relation has about one third reduction comparing with those of the optical _ l - z _  relations .",
    "we obtain the following relationships using nonweighted least - squares fits to the @xmath1-based and n2-based data sets respectively , @xmath58 and @xmath59",
    "while our study clearly demonstrates a good _ l - z _  relation for bcd galaxies , the @xmath60 relation in fig . 7 of hh99 is not obvious .",
    "hopkins et al .",
    "( 2002 ) also claimed that there is no correlation between oxygen abundance and total mass in their bcd sample .",
    "to explain the apparently contradictory results between these two studies and our work , we here compare our sample with hh99 and hopinks and discuss these results in the following .",
    "\\1 ) sample size : the sample of hh99 only contains 13 bcds ( 22 for hopkins sample ) with @xmath34 magnitude span , while our bcd sample is @xmath61 times larger ( see table 3 ) and 2 magnitude wider .",
    "a small number statistics in sample size is difficult to avoid a selection bias .",
    "\\2 ) uncertainties in determining o / h : hh99 used a combination of oxygen abundances determined by ( four ) different methods for their bcd galaxies . despite of a larger uncertainty in empirical - based o / h comparing to @xmath1-based one , the inconsistency of the methods for determining o / h itself might cause an additional uncertainty in systematics .",
    "\\3 ) in hopkins et al . ( 2002 ) , although all of their metallicities are derived with @xmath1-method , they used the width of hi emission - line profile at 20% of peak , @xmath62 , as an indicator of galaxy total mass .",
    "on the one hand , it requires radii and inclinations to calculate galaxy total masses from @xmath62 . on the other hand , @xmath62",
    "also may not be a solid indicator for rotational velocity if turbulent motions are significant , as may be expected for bcd galaxies ( e.g. thuan & martin 1981 ) .",
    "we here used rather uniform data sets and systematically estimated o / h in two different methods , and obtained the _",
    "l - z _  relationships in three bands ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 & @xmath0 ) .",
    "therefore , the results in the present work do nt conflict with those in the literature , and bcds do really show a well - defined _ l - z _  relation .",
    "in table 4 we list some relevant results of the _ l - z _  relations compiled from the literature , and we plot them in fig .",
    "5 . the slope of the @xmath2-@xmath10 relation for dwarf blue compact galaxies ( @xmath65 ; dbcgs ; shi et al .",
    "2005 ) agrees with our results for bcds within uncertainties . for dis ( @xmath66 ) ,",
    "the slopes of the @xmath1-based @xmath2-@xmath10 relation are consistent with each other within the measurement errors ( skillman et al .",
    "1989 ; richer & mccall 1995 ; lee et al .",
    "2003 ; van zee & haynes 2006 ) , and the mean value is @xmath67 , hence much shallower than ours ( @xmath68 ) for bcds . however , the difference in slope between bcds and dis might not be truly significant , and could be mainly due to the small number statistics in sample sizes used in the study of the _ l - z _  relation .",
    "the samples of dis always include no more than 30 ( i.e. @xmath69 ) galaxies at the _ b_-band , and it is difficult to avoid a selection bias .",
    "it is possible that our results are less affected by sample selection given that the size of our sample is about 3 to 6 times larger .",
    "however , diversities do appear to be significant when we compare different slopes of the @xmath2-@xmath10 relation based on different empirical abundance calibrators . as shown in table 4 , all of the empirical calibrator - based slopes , except the absorption - free , kbg03-based one , for the sample ( @xmath70 ) including massive galaxies in salzer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) are steeper than the @xmath1-based slopes for dis , dbcgs and bcds .",
    "but our n2-based slope is a bit steeper than or comparable with the absorption - free slopes from salzer et al .",
    "at the same time , the different slopes derived with different abundance calibrators from salzer et al . show large variations .",
    "these complicated situations might be the results of the fact that the empirical abundance calibrators are model - dependent , and thus have great complexity ( see kewley & ellison 2008 ) .",
    "this reminds us that we should be cautious when comparing slopes of the _ l - z _",
    "relation derived based on different abundance calibrators .",
    "similar to the optical , the @xmath1-based slope of the nir _ l - z _",
    "relation for bcds is consistent with that for dis ( mendes de oliveira et al .",
    "2006 ) . while for the empirical abundance",
    "calibrator - based _",
    "l - z _  relation , our n2-based slope is in agreement with the @xmath71-based slope given by vaduvescu et al . ( 2007 ) .",
    "we further discuss the various possible origins resulting in the differences in the slope and scatter in the _ l - z _",
    "relation below .        as shown in section 3.2 and 3.3 ,",
    "the slope derived with the n2-based metallicity is _ always _ somewhat larger than that derived with the @xmath1-based metallicity for each photometric band ( especially for the nir _ l - z _",
    "relation ) , although they are consistent with each other within the uncertainty . in the following",
    "we discuss the possible origins of this difference .",
    "there are two effects which can cause the slope difference .",
    "one is the uncertainty in the abundance .",
    "the empirical abundance calibrator has larger measured uncertainty relative to the direct method , and thus might result in a slope difference .",
    "this effect is important when the sample is small .",
    "the other reason is the sample itself used to study the _",
    "l - z _  relation . in our work ,",
    "the n2-based sample is a bit different from the @xmath1-based sample .",
    "these two effects could simultaneously affect the _",
    "l - z _  slope .    to check this further",
    ", we use the same sample which both have direct and empirical metallicities to investigate the _",
    "l - z _  relations . in our sample",
    ", we find that there are 60 such galaxies in the optical and 37 such galaxies in the nir .",
    "the slopes are @xmath72 and @xmath73 , for the @xmath1- and n2-based @xmath2-@xmath10 relations respectively .",
    "these two slopes are very consistent . for the @xmath46-@xmath10 relations , these two slopes are @xmath74 and @xmath75 , which are also in accordance with each other .",
    "this indicates that almost all of the slope change between the n2- and @xmath1-based optical _",
    "l - z _  relations is due to the sample issue .",
    "however , it is not the case for the nir data . for the same sample ,",
    "the n2-based slope is @xmath76 , which is still larger than the @xmath1-based one , @xmath77 .",
    "but the difference becomes smaller ( see section 3.3 ) .",
    "we find that the n2 method overestimates the metallicities for several objects at the high luminosity end when we plot these two data sets in the same figure .",
    "this can be also seen from figure 6 , in which the points with circles represent galaxies with @xmath78 mag .",
    "this overestimation ( in fact , it results in a selection effect for a small sample ) , combining with the sample issue , causes the large difference between the @xmath1- and n2-based slopes of the nir relations .",
    "now we return to the nir data of bcds .",
    "the slope of the _ l - z _",
    "relation for our bcd sample decreases monotonically as the wavelength of the photometric band used to construct it increases , which is in agreement with the result of salzer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . this trend can be seen directly through the green and red lines , for our and salzer s results respectively , in fig .",
    "the dotted lines are the error - weighted linear fits to the data . although our slopes have larger uncertainties ( due to the small size of the sample ) , the tendency to decrease of the _ l - z _  slope with wavelength is pronounced .    the variation of the slope of the _ l - z _",
    "relation with wavelength might be expected simply due to stellar population issues . as shown by bell & de jong ( 2001 ) ,",
    "the characteristic colors of galaxies vary smoothly with _",
    "m / l _ ratio , in the sense that higher _",
    "m / l _ values are redder and lower _",
    "m / l _ values are bluer .",
    "color also correlates with luminosity , as shown in fig .",
    "1 , with bluer galaxies being less luminous and redder ones more luminous . for our metal - poor systems , as an example , a galaxy with @xmath79 and @xmath80 will have a @xmath81 color of @xmath32.0 , and hence @xmath82 ( see table 4 of bell & de jong 2001 ) .",
    "a galaxy with @xmath83 and @xmath84 will have @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , according to the models of bell & de jong ( 2001 ) , one would expect a shallower slope in the _ k_-band _",
    "relation , since in this example @xmath87 while @xmath88 for the same two galaxies .",
    "presumably , the effect of stellar population and the lower amounts of absorption will both be acting simultaneously to reduce the observed slope in the nir _ l - z _  relation .",
    "it is not clear which effect will be the dominant one ( or whether they will be of roughly equal magnitude ) . to check this further , we try to investigate a more fundamental relation , mz relation .",
    "we convert luminosity into stellar mass using the @xmath89 ratio - color relation given by bell & de jong ( 2001 ) , which is derived by using the bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) model with a salpter imf ( 1955 ) and @xmath90 .",
    "we adopt this sub - solar abundance model since our sample is metal - poor .",
    "the following three mz relations are derived , @xmath91 where @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 denote that the stellar mass is obtained by using the @xmath63- , @xmath64- and @xmath95-band luminosity respectively . from eq . ( 11 ) we can see that the slopes of the mz relations are very consistent .",
    "if we use the identical sample ( i.e. same as the @xmath95-band sample ) for these three bands , the difference between these mz slopes is even smaller , namely , @xmath96 for @xmath63- and @xmath64-band and @xmath97 for @xmath95-band .",
    "these results suggest that the variation of @xmath89 dominates the slope difference between the optical and nir _ l - z _  relations , while the absorption only has little effect , for our metal - poor galaxy sample .      the rms scatter of the @xmath1-based _ l - z _",
    "relation is much lower for the nir data compared to the optical data .",
    "there are @xmath98 and @xmath99 reductions in the rms scatter of the _ @xmath100-z _ relation relative to that of the _ @xmath101-z _ and _ @xmath102-z _ relation , respectively .",
    "this indicates that the nir data should be more suitable for studying the _ l - z _",
    "relation . however , the rms scatter of the n2-based _ l - z _",
    "relation has little change ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "this is believed to be due to the relatively much larger uncertainties in the o / h derived with the empirical n2 method ( see the following ) .",
    "since the majority of the oxygen abundances are compiled from literature , our result may suffer from the uncertainty of aperture effect .",
    "we compare metallicities derived by different authors ( sources with more than one references for their metallicities in table 2 ) .",
    "we find that the @xmath1-based oxygen abundances determined by different works agree with each other within 0.10 dex , except for a few points with large measurement errors .",
    "however , the n2-based abundances from different works appear to have larger scatter .",
    "therefore , aperture effect may only have a minor contribution to the scatter in the @xmath1-based _ l - z _",
    "relation on condition that we ve used an error - weighted mean value .",
    "while for the n2-based _ l - z _",
    "relation , this effect should be one main source causing the scatter .",
    "the n2-o / h relation ( eq .",
    "( 4)),which itself has @xmath43 dex scatter , can also cause additional uncertainties in the n2-based _ l - z _  relations . generally , as shown in fig .",
    "6 , the n2-based and @xmath1-based o / h is uniformly distributed around the @xmath104 line , but the standard deviation is as large as 0.19 dex . for several galaxies , the deviation can be up to 0.4 - 0.6 dex .",
    "therefore , the uncertainties introduced by the n2-method itself , along with the aperture effect , should be the major reason causing the deviant points in the n2-based _ l - z _  plots .",
    "given the fact that the typical errors are 0.05 , 0.10 and 0.15 mag , in the _",
    "b_- , _ r_- and @xmath0-band photometry , respectively , the observed rms scatter of 1.15 , 1.12 and 1.01 mag , in the _",
    "b_- , _ r_- and @xmath0-band respectively , may be affected by some other parameters .",
    "kobulnicky et al . (",
    "2003 ) searched for correlations between various parameters ( e.g. , color , size , ew of h@xmath105 , @xmath106 luminosity ) and magnitude residuals ( @xmath107the observed absolute magnitude @xmath108 the derived magnitude from the _ l - z _",
    "relation using a given metallicity ) in their derived @xmath2-@xmath10 relationship in order to investigate whether there are any  second - parameter effects \" that might be responsible for increased scatter in the _ l - z _  relation .",
    "they found no correlations for their local sample .",
    "figure 7 shows the galaxy oxygen abundance , color , ew@xmath109 and h@xmath110 luminosity ( from the left to the right ) plotted versus @xmath111 from the best - fit linear @xmath1-based _ l - z _",
    "relation for bcds .",
    "the bottom panels plot the full sample of 66 bcds , while the upper two panels plot the subsample of 39 galaxies which have @xmath0 magnitude measured .",
    "figures 7_a _ and 7_i _ indicate that there is a weak correlation between @xmath112 and metallicity .",
    "a spearman rank correlation coefficient analysis gives @xmath113 and @xmath114 at a 2.9@xmath47 and 3.3@xmath47 level of significance , for fig .",
    "7_a _ and fig .",
    "7_i _ respectively .",
    "however , this correlation may be driven by the three points ( in fig .",
    "7_i _ ) which have the highest and lowest metallicities in this sample . to test this , we do the spearman rank correlation coefficient analysis excluding these three points and obtain @xmath115 at 2.5@xmath47 confidence",
    "this suggests the scatter of @xmath2-@xmath10 relation does really correlate with the metallicity , although the correlation is weak .",
    "meanwhile , both of figures 7_d _ and 7_l _ show anti - correlations between @xmath112 and @xmath116 , indicating that this correlation really exists .",
    "a spearman rank correlation coefficient analysis gives @xmath117 at a @xmath118 level of significance for fig .",
    "7_l_. we got a similar result ( @xmath119 at @xmath118 confidence ) when excluding the two points with the largest deviations ( one has a huge metallicity uncertainty and the other does nt have a metallicity uncertainty ) and the point with the largest @xmath120 .",
    "therefore , these two correlations are not driven by some suspect points but reasonable in the sense that ( 1 ) a higher metallicity might possibly cause a larger internal extinction ; ( 2 ) higher h@xmath110 luminosity means higher blue luminosity .",
    "but the large scatters in these two correlations indicate that the observed scatter may represent some fundamental cosmic scatter ( e.g. time of formation of galaxies , age dispersion , etc ; see calura et al .",
    "2009 ) in the _ l - z _  relation .",
    "however , no obvious correlation between the ( _ b - r _ ) or ew@xmath109 and @xmath111 can be seen in figures 7_b _ , 7_f _ , 7_j _",
    ", 7_g _ and 7_k_. by comparing figure 7_c _ with figure 7_k _ , one can find that the correlation appearing in figure 7_c _ is due to the small number of statistics involved in sample .    for the @xmath0-band",
    ", there only exists one possible correlation between @xmath121and metallicity , and we can not draw a firm conclusion because of the lack of data at the low metallicity end . to check this ,",
    "we compare the same data set of the _ b_-band with the @xmath0-band , and find a similar trend for all of three samples ( see figures 7_a _ , 7_e _ and 7_i _ ) .",
    "therefore , _ the correlation between the _ l - z _  relation residuals and metallicity is true , and is not due to the sample issues .",
    "_ however , a spearman rank correlation coefficient analysis indicate that the correlation between @xmath121and _ z _ is much weaker than that in _ b_-band .",
    "the correlation coefficient is 0.34 and only at a 2.1@xmath47 level of significance .",
    "this is because that the nir data suffer much less extinctions than the optical data .",
    "in contrast to the _",
    "b_-band , the seeming correlation between @xmath121 and @xmath116 , as shown in figure 7_h _ , is caused by the sample issue .",
    "this result is very reasonable since the current star forming activities should have much less effect on @xmath9 than on @xmath2 .",
    "by cross - correlating the blue compact dwarf galaxy sample of gil de paz et al .",
    "( 2003 ) with the sdss dr6 , we derived and compiled oxygen abundances for a subsample containing @xmath122 bcd galaxies using both the direct ( @xmath1 ) and empirical ( n2 ) methods .",
    "the uniformity of the sample , combining with its relatively large size , makes this an excellent data set to systematically study the _",
    "l - z _  relations for bcds for the first time .",
    "we investigate the _ l - z _  relations in three different photometric bands ( @xmath123 ) and explore the effects of using different abundance calibrators on the resulting _",
    "l - z _  relations .",
    "the main results are summarized bellow :    \\(1 ) we present _ l - z _  relations for all three bands , from optical to near infrared , for these bcd galaxies .",
    "our study reconciles apparently contradictory results obtained by different authors .",
    "we find that the slope of _ l - z _  relation calibrated with the empirical n2-method , for each photometric band , is consistent with that evaluated using the @xmath1-based metallicities within the uncertainty .",
    "\\(2 ) we confirm the similar result for bcds here that the slope of the _ l - z _  relation becomes shallower with longer wavelength of the photometric band used , as has been found in larger samples that include more luminous systems ( salzer et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "\\(3 ) the correlation between the _ l - z _  relation residuals and h@xmath110 luminosities in the _",
    "b_-band , combined with the fact that no such correlation exists in the @xmath0-band , indicates that the starburst activities might be a cause of the large scatter in the @xmath2-@xmath10 relation .",
    "meanwhile , the weak correlation between the _ l - z _  relation residuals and metallicity might suggest that the internal - absorption is another possible factor contributing to the scatter in the _ l - z _",
