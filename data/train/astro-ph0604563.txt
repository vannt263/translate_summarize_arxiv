    "at @xmath3 , galaxy clusters contain a population of blue , distorted galaxies that is missing in local clusters : the so - called butcher - oemler effect @xcite . in their spectroscopic study of blue galaxies in three clusters at z@xmath40.31 @xcite",
    "found that sixty percent of these blue galaxies ( classified as type 3 galaxies ) have optical spectra characterised by strong balmer absorption lines , typical for a very young stellar population , but with weak , if any , emission lines , such as [ ]  @xmath53727 .",
    "since these spectra are a superposition of an old stellar population , resembling that of an elliptical or e galaxy , and a young stellar population , dominated by a stars , these galaxies are called e+a galaxies . in the notation of @xcite",
    ", these galaxies would be classified as k+a",
    "/ a+k , satisfying the criteria ew([])@xmath6 and ew(h@xmath73 .",
    "while at @xmath8 , about 20% of all cluster galaxies are classified as e+as @xcite , they constitute less than 1% of the present - day clusterpopulation @xcite .    apparently , these galaxies are observed during a quiescent phase , which explains the lack of emission lines , soon after a vigorous starburst , which explains the strong balmer absorption lines . due to the short lifetimes of the stars causing the balmer absorption ,",
    "the starburst must have ended no more than @xmath9  gyr ago @xcite .",
    "e+as often have disturbed morphologies , e.g. tidal tails , suggestive of recent merger or interaction events .",
    "they span the whole morphological range , from bulge - dominated with underlying disks to disk - dominated @xcite .",
    "their high surface brightness sets them apart from the elliptical and lenticular galaxies in the fundamental plane . over time , fading of the stellar population will drive them towards the locus of the e / s0s @xcite .",
    "internal velocity dispersions of galaxies classified as e+as appear to increase as a function of redshift , going from @xmath10 kms@xmath11  at @xmath12 to @xmath13 kms@xmath11  at @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "this trend suggests that massive galaxies undergo an e+a phase , i.e. are observed in a post - starburst phase , at earlier cosmic times than less massive ones .",
    "this is reminiscent of the `` down - sizing '' phenomenon in star - forming galaxies @xcite , according to which the masses of galaxies hosting star formation decrease as the universe ages .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      we estimate the star - formation rate ( sfr ) associated with the observed hi masses using the relation @xmath15 @xcite . we substituted the total hi mass divided by @xmath16 , with @xmath17 the half - light radius , for the gas surface density @xmath18 .",
    "from the archival f625w hst / acs images of ea17 , ea18 and ea19 , we derived surface brightness profiles as a function of radius by integrating the light in circular apertures centered on the galaxy .",
    "a similar method was applied to derive the half - light radii for the sdss galaxies from sloan r - band images .",
    "we fitted seeing or psf convolved srsic profiles to the surface brightness profiles of all galaxies .",
    "the seeing and psf profiles are determined from about 10 stars in each image .",
    "we used the surface brightness profile of a galaxy , extrapolated beyond the last data point by the best fitting srsic profile , to measure the half - light radii of these e+as . the sfr surface density , @xmath19 ,",
    "was then converted into a global sfr by multiplying with @xmath20 . in all cases but sdss  j230743.41 + 152558.4 and ea19",
    ", we found the e+as detected at 21  cm to have sfrs in the range @xmath21 ( see table  [ eaproperties ] ) , which is higher than expected for post - starburst galaxies .",
    "hence , these gas - rich e+as could be actively forming stars at quite high rates but the star - formation sites are obscured by dust . alternatively , although much gas is present , almost no stars are being formed .",
    "the radio continuum observations of @xcite rule out star formation at a rate higher than @xmath22 in the case of ea17 and ea18 .",
    "these authors measure a star formation rate of @xmath23 in ea19 .",
    "while the star formation rate of ea19 agrees roughly with our upper limit , the high star formation rates of ea17 and ea18 derived from their hi content are in clear contradiction with the very low rates derived from radio continuum observations .",
    "unfortunately , no radio continuum observations have been performed of sdss  j210258.87 + 103300.6 , sdss  j230743.41 + 152558.4 , and sdss  j233453.20 + 145048.7 so far .",
    "three out of the six galaxies observed by us contain detectable amounts of neutral gas and one is a border case .",
    "both the sdss and the zabludoff samples satisfy very strict selection criteria and surely do not show any optical evidence for star formation :  these appear to be true post - starburst galaxies .",
    "they do , however , contain significant amounts of neutral gas .",
    "ea19 is not detected by us in 21  cm line emission , with a 3@xmath24 upperlimit on the  mass of @xmath25 .",
    "ea18 was detected by us , with a 21  cm flux consistent with an  mass of @xmath26 of .     versus @xmath27 .",
    "spiral galaxies @xcite are depicted by spiral symbols , elliptical galaxies @xcite by blue circles ( the shade of blue is an indication of spectroscopic age and the vertical black line shows the luminosity limit of log(@xmath28)=9.5 that was used by @xcite ) , and e+a galaxies by red circles ( this work ) and orange circles @xcite . the predicted trend for late - type galaxies by the semi - analytical models of @xcite",
    "is plotted in green .",
    "[ loglm],width=321 ]    in fig .",
    "[ loglm ] , we plotted @xmath29 versus @xmath27 , @xmath28 the b - band luminosity expressed in solar b - band luminosities , for a sample of spiral galaxies @xcite , elliptical galaxies @xcite , and e+a galaxies ( this work and * ? ? ? * ) along with the predicted @xmath29 versus @xmath27 relation for late - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "for the e+as from the sdss sample , we converted the sdss g and r magnitudes to the b - band magnitude using the conversion formulae of @xcite .",
    "the b@xmath30 magnitudes of the lcrs e+as were converted into b - band magnitudes using the relation @xmath31 from @xcite .",
    "using the mean b@xmath32v colour of the sdss e+as , @xmath33  mag , in this equation , we find @xmath34  mag .",
    "the absolute b - band magnitudes found by applying these conversion formulae are also listed in table 1 .",
    "ellipticals with young spectroscopic ages ( @xmath35  gyr ) are generally more gas - rich than older elliptical galaxies , which @xcite interpret as evidence for a merger origin for elliptical galaxies :  the starburst following the merger rapidly consumes the gas reservoir and subsequent quiescent star formation consumes the gas at a much slower rate .",
    "it should be noted that @xcite include only ellipticals brighter than @xmath36  mag , or @xmath37 , in their sample because fainter galaxies are likely to have experienced different evolutionary histories .",
    "the resulting sample of ellipticals spans about the same luminosity range as the e+a samples .    as is clear from fig .",
    "[ loglm ] , some e+as are more gas - rich than most young elliptical galaxies .",
    "this is most likely not a selection effect , since the e+a data set was assembled based on optical , spectral properties and the elliptical galaxies were selected according to optical morphological considerations , not on hi mass .",
    "one would , moreover , expect the @xcite data set to be complete for galaxies with large hi masses .",
    "we performed a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) and wilcoxon ( w ) test on the @xmath38 distribution ( within the same magnitude limits , both in @xmath28 and @xmath29 , i.e. in the region defined by the detected e+as ) and found that the distribution of e+a galaxies ( i ) corresponds with that of spiral and young elliptical galaxies with a significance of respectively 99% ( ks ) or 94% ( w ) and 65% ( ks ) or 79% ( w ) and ( ii ) differs from that of old elliptical galaxies with a confidence level of 79% ( ks ) or 78% ( w ) . this statistical test and fig .",
    "[ loglm ] might suggest a gas depletion time sequence , with e+as being observed less than @xmath39  myr after the termination of the starburst that followed the putative merger @xcite , young ellipticals after @xmath35  gyr , and old ellipticals at later times .",
    "however , one should note that the difference between the distributions of e+as and elliptical galaxies has just a significance of 1@xmath24 . in order to derive conclusive evidence for this suggestion ,",
    "a larger statistical sample of hi masses and spectroscopic ages of e+as is essential .",
    "nevertheless , if correct , this ties together with the morphological study of 5 e+as from the zabludoff ( 1996 ) sample with hst by @xcite , who suggest that e+as are likely to evolve to elliptical galaxies with power - law density profiles .",
    "one should also note that the end of a starburst does not necessarily require the complete exhaustion of the neutral gas reservoir .",
    "this could be explained by the fact that neutral gas itself is not the raw material for star formation :  stars form in the dense cores of molecular clouds . @xcite",
    "have obtained co(@xmath40 ) and hcn(@xmath40 ) observations of the nearby post - starburst galaxy ngc5195 , which , interestingly , forms an interacting pair with ngc5194 .",
    "these authors note a central decrease of the mass fraction of dense molecular cores , leaving only diffuse molecular gas , evidenced by a very low central @xmath41 value .",
    "most likely , an intense central burst of star formation @xmath9  gyr ago , responsible for the observed population of a stars , evaporated the dense molecular clouds , which are the sites where massive stars form .",
    "this effectively stopped further star formation , although large amounts of diffuse neutral and molecular gas remain .",
    "a similar mechanism may be responsible for switching off the starburst in e+a galaxies without the necessity of consuming the complete gas reservoir .",
    "the remaining  reservoir in some e+as may eventually lead , after gas has been allowed to condense into molecular cores , to further episodes of star formation .",
    "( [ sfr ] ) , which is based on observations of normal spiral galaxies that host a balanced mix of neutral and molecular gas , may therefore not be applicable to post - starburst galaxies .",
    "we present deep single - dish  observations of a sample of six nearby e+a galaxies ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "we find masses of @xmath42 for sdss  j210258.87 + 103300.6 , @xmath43 for sdss  j230743.41 + 152558.4 , @xmath44 for sdss  j233453.20 + 145048.7 , and @xmath26 for ea18 .",
    "the @xmath45 upperlimits for the gas content of ea17 and ea19 are @xmath46 and @xmath25 respectively , assuming a total velocity width of 450 kms@xmath11 ( the average velocity width of the detected galaxies ) .",
    "the three galaxies from the sdss sample satisfy very strict selection criteria and , for all practical purposes , can be considered to be truly post - starburst galaxies .",
    "the e+a galaxies detected in 21  cm line emission are almost as gas - rich as spiral galaxies with comparable luminosities . by plotting these e+as , spiral galaxies , and elliptical galaxies in a @xmath38 versus @xmath27 diagram , and performing a kolmogorov - smirnov and wilcoxon test",
    "we suggest that existence of a gas depletion time sequence , with e+as being observed very shortly after the termination of the starburst that ensued from the putative merger , young ellipticals after @xmath35  gyr , and old ellipticals at even later times .",
    "this would tie together with the morphological study of 5 e+as from the zabludoff ( 1996 ) sample with hst by @xcite , who suggest that e+as are likely to evolve to elliptical galaxies with power - law density profiles .",
    "however , the conclusions drawn here are just based on 1@xmath24 trends . a larger sample of  detections and spectroscopic ages of e+as is required to investigate this hypothesis .    the presence of  in an e+a galaxy can be explained in two ways .",
    "+ ( i ) we can interpret the lack of on - going star - formation in e+a galaxies , suggested by previous radio continuum observations @xcite and indirectly by their selection criteria , and the fact that the end of the starburst does not necessarily require the complete exhaustion of the neutral gas reservoir , as being due to the effect the starburst has on the dense molecular cores which are responsible for the massive star formation .",
    "an intense burst of star formation can evaporate the dense molecular clouds , effectively stopping further star formation , even though copious amounts of diffuse neutral and molecular gas remain .",
    "the remaining  reservoir in some e+as may eventually lead , after the gas has again condensed into molecular cores , to further episodes of star formation .",
    "this may indicate that e+as are observed in the inactive phase of the star - formation duty cycle . + ( ii )",
    "a second possibility is what previously has been proposed by couch & sharples ( 1987 ) and blake et al .",
    "there might still be on - going star - formation associated with the presence of gas , which is hinted from the high sfr ( see table  [ eaproperties ] ) of our e+a galaxies ; however it can not be observed since it is obscured by dust @xcite , which is suggested by the acs images in fig .",
    "[ ima_ea ] , and/or optical emission lines might be a poor way of isolating true post - starbust systems . in this case e+a galaxies are in the active star - formation phase and will presumably exhaust all their gas content .",
