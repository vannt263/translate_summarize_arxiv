    "in classical quantum statistics one works exclusively with bose and fermi statistics ( bosons and fermions ) .",
    "a historically important extension or generalization of these quantum statistics has been known for 50 years , namely the para - bose and para - fermi statistics as developed by green  @xcite . instead of the classical bilinear commutators or anti - commutators as for bosons and fermions ,",
    "para - statistics is described by means of certain trilinear or triple relations .",
    "for example , for @xmath7 pairs of para - fermi creation and annihilation operators @xmath8 ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) , the defining relations are : @xmath11 , f_{l}^{\\epsilon}]=\\frac 1 2 ( \\epsilon -\\eta)^2 \\delta_{kl } f_{j}^{\\xi } -\\frac 1 2   ( \\epsilon -\\xi)^2 \\delta_{jl}f_{k}^{\\eta } , \\label{para - fermi } \\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad \\xi , \\eta , \\epsilon = \\pm\\hbox { or } \\pm 1;\\quad j , k , l=1,\\ldots , n .",
    "\\nn \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] about ten years after the introduction of para - fermi relations by green , it was proved that these relations are associated with the orthogonal lie algebra @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the lie algebra generated by the @xmath13 elements @xmath14 , with @xmath9 and @xmath10 , subject to the relations  ( [ para - fermi ] ) , is @xmath15 ( as a lie algebra defined by means of generators and relations ) .",
    "in fact , this can be considered as an alternative definition instead of the common definition by means of chevalley generators and their known relations expressed by means of the cartan matrix elements ( inclusive the serre relations ) .",
    "moreover , there is a certain representation of @xmath15 , the so - called fermi representation @xmath16 , that yields the classical fermi relations .",
    "in other words , the representatives @xmath17 satisfy the bilinear relations of classical fermi statistics .",
    "thus the usual fermi statistics corresponds to a particular realization of para - fermi statistics . for general para - fermi statistics",
    ", a class of finite dimensional @xmath15 representations ( of fock type ) needs to be investigated .",
    "twenty years after the connection between para - fermi statistics and the lie algebra @xmath15 , a new connection , between para - bose statistics and the orthosymplectic lie superalgebra @xmath18  @xcite was discovered  @xcite .",
    "the situation here is similar : the lie superalgebra generated by @xmath13 odd elements @xmath19 , with @xmath9 and @xmath10 , subject to the triple relations of para - bose statistics , is @xmath20 ( as a lie superalgebra defined by means of generators and relations ) . also here",
    "there is a particular representation of @xmath20 , the so - called bose representation @xmath21 , that yields the classical bose relations , i.e. where the representatives @xmath22 satisfy the relations of classical bose statistics . for more general para - bose statistics ,",
    "a class of infinite dimensional @xmath20 representations needs to be investigated , and one of these representations corresponds with ordinary bose statistics .    from these historical examples",
    "it is clear that para - statistics , as introduced by green  @xcite and further developed by many other research teams ( see  @xcite and the references therein ) , can be associated with representations of the lie ( super)algebras of class @xmath23 ( namely @xmath4 and @xmath24 ) .",
    "the question that arises is whether alternative interesting types of generalized quantum statistics can be found in the framework of other classes of simple lie algebras or superalgebras . in this paper",
    "we shall classify all the classes of generalized quantum statistics for the classical lie algebras @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , by means of their algebraic relations . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we hope to perform a similar classification for the classical lie superalgebras .",
    "we should mention that certain generalizations related to other lie algebras have already been considered  @xcite-@xcite , although a complete classification was never made .",
    "for example , for the lie algebra @xmath25  @xcite , a set of creation and annihilation operators has been described , and it was shown that @xmath7 pairs of operators @xmath26 , with @xmath9 and @xmath10 , subject to the defining relations @xmath27,a^+_k]= \\delta_{jk } a^+_i + \\delta_{ij } a^+_k , \\nn\\\\ & & [ [ a^+_i , a^-_j],a^-_k]= -\\delta_{ik } a^-_j - \\delta_{ij } a^-_k , \\label{a - relations}\\\\ & & [ a^+_i , a^+_j]=[a^-_i , a^-_j]=0 , \\nn\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( @xmath28 ) , generate the special linear lie algebra @xmath29 ( as a lie algebra defined by means of generators and relations ) .",
    "just as in the case of para - fermi relations , ( [ a - relations ] ) has two interpretations .",
    "on the one hand , ( [ a - relations ] ) describes the algebraic relations of a new kind of generalized statistics , in this case @xmath30-statistics or statistics related to the lie algebra @xmath3 . on the other hand , ( [ a - relations ] )",
    "yields a set of defining relations for the lie algebra @xmath3 in terms of generators and relations .",
    "observe that certain microscopic and macroscopic properties of @xmath30-statistics have already been studied  @xcite-@xcite .    the description ( [ a - relations ] )",
    "was given for the first time by n.  jacobson  @xcite in the context of `` lie triple systems '' .",
    "therefore , this type of generators is often referred to as the `` jacobson generators '' of @xmath29 . in this context",
    ", we shall mainly use the terminology `` creation and annihilation operators ( caos ) for @xmath29 '' .    in the following section we shall give a precise definition of `` generalized quantum statistics associated with a lie algebra @xmath1 '' and the corresponding creation and annihilation operators .",
    "it will be clear that this notion is closely related to gradings of @xmath1 , and to regular subalgebras of @xmath1 .",
    "following the definition , we go on to describe the actual classification method . in the remaining sections of this paper ,",
    "the classification results are presented .",
    "the paper ends with some closing remarks and further outlook .",
    "let @xmath1 be a ( classical ) lie algebra .",
    "a generalized quantum statistics associated with @xmath1 is determined by a set of @xmath31 creation operators @xmath32 and @xmath31 annihilation operators @xmath33 .",
    "inspired by the para - fermi case and the example of @xmath30-statistics , these @xmath34 operators should satisfy certain conditions .",
    "first of all , these @xmath34 operators should generate the lie algebra @xmath1 , subject to certain triple relations like  ( [ para - fermi ] ) or  ( [ a - relations ] ) .",
    "let @xmath35 and @xmath36 be the subspaces of @xmath1 spanned by these elements : @xmath37 then @xmath38 $ ] can be zero ( in which case the creation operators mutually commute , as in  ( [ a - relations ] ) ) or non - zero ( as in  ( [ para - fermi ] ) ) .",
    "a similar statement holds for the annihilation operators and @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "the fact that the defining relations should be triple relations , implies that it is natural to make the following requirements : @xmath40,x^+_k ] = 0,\\\\ & & [ [ x^+_i , x^+_j],x^-_k ] = \\hbox{a lineair combination of } x^+_l,\\\\ & & [ [ x^+_i , x^-_j],x^+_k ] = \\hbox{a lineair combination of } x^+_l,\\\\ & & [ [ x^+_i , x^-_j],x^-_k ] = \\hbox{a lineair combination of } x^-_l,\\\\ & & [ [ x^-_i , x^-_j],x^+_k ] = \\hbox{a lineair combination of } x^-_l,\\\\ & & [ [ x^-_i , x^-_j],x^-_k ] = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so let @xmath41 $ ] and @xmath42 $ ] , then we may require @xmath43 ( direct sum as vector spaces ) to be a @xmath2-grading of a subalgebra of @xmath1 . furthermore , since we want @xmath1 to be generated by the @xmath34 elements subject to the triple relations , one must have @xmath44 .",
    "there are two additional assumptions , again inspired by the known examples ( [ para - fermi ] ) and ( [ a - relations ] ) .",
    "one is related to the fact that creation and annihilation operators are usually considered to be each others conjugate .",
    "so , let @xmath45 be the standard antilinear anti - involutive mapping of the lie algebra @xmath1 ( characterized by @xmath46 in the standard defining representation of @xmath1 , where @xmath47 denotes the transpose complex conjugate of the matrix @xmath48 in this representation ) then we should have @xmath49 . and",
    "finally , we shall assume that the generating elements @xmath50 are certain root vectors of the lie algebra @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath1 be a classical lie algebra , with antilinear anti - involutive mapping @xmath45 .",
    "a set of @xmath34 root vectors @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) is called a set of creation and annihilation operators for @xmath1 if :    * @xmath53 , * @xmath44 is a @xmath2-grading of @xmath1 , with @xmath54 and @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "the algebraic relations @xmath56 satisfied by the operators @xmath50 are the relations of a generalized quantum statistics ( gqs ) associated with @xmath1 .",
    "so a gqs is characterized by a set @xmath57 of caos and the set of algebraic relations @xmath56 they satisfy .",
    "a consequence of this definition is that @xmath1 is generated by @xmath36 and @xmath35 , i.e.  by the set of caos .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath55 $ ] , it follows that @xmath58 ; \\quad i , j=1,\\ldots , n,\\ \\xi,\\eta=\\pm\\}.\\ ] ] this implies that it is necessary and sufficient to give all relations of the following type :    * the set of all linear relations between the elements @xmath59 $ ] ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) .",
    "* the set of all triple relations of the form @xmath62,x_k^\\zeta]= \\hbox{linear combination of } x_l^\\theta$ ] .",
    "so in general @xmath56 consists of a set of quadratic relations ( linear combinations of elements of the type @xmath59 $ ] ) and a set of triple relations .",
    "this also implies that , as a lie algebra defined by generators and relations , @xmath1 is uniquely characterized by the set of generators @xmath50 subject to the relations @xmath56 .",
    "another consequence of this definition is that @xmath63 itself is a subalgebra of @xmath1 spanned by root vectors of @xmath1 , i.e.  @xmath63 is a regular subalgebra of @xmath1 .",
    "even more : @xmath63 is a regular subalgebra containing the cartan subalgebra @xmath64 of @xmath1 . and by the adjoint action , the remaining @xmath65 s are @xmath63-modules .",
    "thus the following technique can be used in order to obtain a complete classification of all gqs associated with @xmath1 :    1 .   determine all regular subalgebras @xmath63 of @xmath1 .",
    "if not yet contained in @xmath63 , replace @xmath63 by @xmath66 .",
    "2 .   for each regular subalgebra @xmath63 , determine the decomposition of @xmath1 into simple @xmath63-modules @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "3 .   investigate whether there exists a @xmath2-grading of @xmath1 of the form @xmath69 where each @xmath65 is either directly a module @xmath67 or else a sum of such modules @xmath70 , such that @xmath71 .",
    "the first stage in this technique is a known one : to find regular subalgebras one can use the method of extended dynkin diagrams  @xcite .",
    "the second stage is straightforward by means of lie algebra representation techniques .",
    "the third stage requires most of the work : one must try out all possible combinations of the @xmath63-modules @xmath67 , and see whether it is possible to obtain a grading of the type  ( [ 5grading ] ) . in this process , if one of the simple @xmath63-modules @xmath67 is such that @xmath72 , then it follows that this module should be part of @xmath63 . in other words ,",
    "such a case reduces essentially to another case with a larger regular subalgebra .    in general , when the rank of the semi - simple regular subalgebra is equal or close to the rank of @xmath1 , the corresponding @xmath2-grading of @xmath1 is `` short '' in the sense that @xmath73 for @xmath74 or @xmath75 . when the rank of the regular subalgebra becomes smaller",
    ", the corresponding @xmath2-grading of @xmath1 is `` long '' , and @xmath76 for @xmath75 .",
    "thus the analysis shows that it is usually sufficient to consider maximal regular subalgebras ( same rank ) , or almost maximal regular subalgebras ( rank of @xmath1 minus 1 or 2 ) .",
    "note that in  @xcite a definition of caos was already given .",
    "our definition 1 is inspired by the definition in  @xcite , however it is different in the sense that the grading conditions @xmath77 $ ] are new .",
    "it is thanks to these new conditions that we are able to give a complete classification of caos and the corresponding gqs .    in the following sections we shall give a summary of the classification process for the classical lie algebras @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "note that , in order to identify a gqs associated with @xmath1 , it is sufficient to give only the set of caos , or alternatively , to give the subspace @xmath36 ( then the @xmath33 are the root vectors of @xmath36 , and @xmath78 ) .",
    "the set @xmath56 then consist of all quadratic relations ( i.e. the linear relations between the elements @xmath59 $ ] ) and all triple relations , and all of these relations follow from the known commutation relations in @xmath1 .",
    "because , in principle , @xmath56 can be determined from the set @xmath79 , we will not always give it explicitly .",
    "in fact , when @xmath31 is large , the corresponding relations can become rather numerous and long .",
    "such examples of gqs would be too complicated for applications in physics .",
    "for this reason , we shall give @xmath56 explicitly only when @xmath31 is not too large , more precisely when @xmath31 is either equal to the rank of @xmath1 or at most double the rank of @xmath1 .",
    "finally , observe that two different sets of caos @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( same @xmath31 ) are said to be isomorphic if , for a certain permutation @xmath82 of @xmath83 , the relations between the elements @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the same . in that case , the regular subalgebra @xmath63 spanned by @xmath86\\}$ ] is isomorphic ( as a lie algebra ) to the regular subalgebra spanned by @xmath87\\}$ ] .",
