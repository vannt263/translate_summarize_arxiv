    "charge transport in single - molecule junctions has raised a great deal of interest recently.@xcite experimental studies on transport properties of molecular junctions revealed a variety of interesting phenomena , e.g. , coulomb blockade,@xcite kondo effect,@xcite negative differential resistance,@xcite switching and hysteresis.@xcite this has stimulated many theoretical developments for understanding quantum transport at the molecular scale .",
    "examples of approximate methods employed in this regard include the scattering theory,@xcite nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) approaches,@xcite and master equation methods.@xcite to the other end , a variety of ( in principle ) numerically exact methods have been developed to obtain more reliable results for nonequilibrium transport in model systems .",

    "coupled electron transport , we have demonstrated@xcite the importance of treating the vibronic coupling accurately .",
    "comparison with approximate methods such as negf revealed the necessity of employing accurate methods such as the ml - mctdh - sqr approach , in particular in the strong coupling regime .",
    "the ml - mctdh - sqr method@xcite employs a recursive , layered representation of the overall wave function and captures correlation effects through a converged multiconfigurational expansion in all the corresponding layers . like any other methods , the efficiency of the ml - mctdh - sqr theory depends on how the problem is approached , e.g. , the choice of the an appropriate coordinate system",
    "consequently , the term `` correlation '' also depends on such a choice .",
    "for example , the quantum dynamics of a quadratic hamiltonian , where a full hessian is present , is highly correlated .",
    "on the other hand , when this hamiltonian is transformed to the normal mode representation , there is no correlation at all between different degrees of freedom .",
    "in this sense we can term the former correlation as `` artificial correlation '' due to the inappropriate representation of the hamiltonian .",
    "finding an optimal representation is thus crucial for solving the problem efficiently .",
    "unfortunately , this is typically not an automatic procedure and requires a clear physical understanding of the problem . in most cases , a simple analytic reduction of the problem as the example above is not available .",
    "instead , one has to transform the hamiltonian according to the physical intuition and known experiences .",
    "one of the most frequently used criterion is to ensure that this transformation reduces the problem in a certain physical limit .    in a previous ml - mctdh - sqr study of vibrationally",
    "coupled electron transport,@xcite we had found that in some regimes the configuration space required to achieve convergence is quite large .",
    "we noticed , however , that these regimes are not necessarily characterized by a strong correlation in the usual sense .",
    "in fact , it was often relatively easy to converge the simulation when the electron - nuclear coupling is strong ( i.e. , easier to capture the `` real '' correlation effect induced by electronic - vibrational coupling ) , but not otherwise ( i.e. more difficult to capture artificial electron correlation effects ) , especially when the source - drain bias voltage is high",
    ". this has motivated us to examine other representations of the hamiltonian for studying nonequilibrium charge transport .",
    "one promising choice is to employ the scattering states of the underlying electronic hamiltonian .",
    "the resulting scattering states representation of the model has been used before to describe quantum transport in combination with different methods.@xcite in this paper we discuss our implementation of the scattering state representation within the framework of the ml - mctdh - sqr theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ modeltight ] outlines the original , tight - binding type model for describing the vibrationally coupled electron transport .",
    "section  [ modelscatter ] then discusses the scattering state representation of the same problem and our specific choice of the reference frame .",
    "section  [ results ] illustrates the performance of our approach by numerical examples for a variety of parameter regimes .",
    "section  [ conclusions ] concludes with a summary .",
    "a model that is frequently adopted to study vibrationally coupled electron transport through a single - molecule junction is based on tight - binding description for the two metal leads .",
    "it comprises one discrete electronic state at the molecular bridge , two electronic continua describing the left and the right metal leads , respectively , and a distribution of harmonic oscillators that models the vibrational modes of the molecular bridge .",
    "the hamiltonian reads    [ htot ] @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 describe the pure electronic degrees of freedom and the nuclear vibrations with their coupling terms to the electronic part , respectively @xmath3 @xmath4    thereby , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 are the fermionic creation / annihilation operators for the electronic states on the molecular bridge , the left and the right leads , respectively .",
    "the corresponding electronic energies @xmath8 , @xmath9 and the molecule - lead coupling strengths @xmath10 , @xmath11 , are defined through the energy - dependent level width functions @xmath12 in principle , the parameters of the model can be obtained for a specific molecular junction employing first - principles electronic structure calculations.@xcite in this paper , which focuses on the methodology and general transport properties , however , we will use a generic parameterization . employing a tight - binding model , the function @xmath13 is given as    [ tight ] @xmath14 @xmath15    where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are nearest - neighbor couplings between two lead sites and between the lead and the bridge state , respectively .",
    "i.e. , the width functions for the left and the right leads are obtained by shifting @xmath18 relative to the chemical potentials of the corresponding leads .",
    "we consider a simple model of two identical leads , in which the chemical potentials are given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the source - drain bias voltage and @xmath21 the fermi energy of the leads .",
    "since only the difference @xmath22 is physically relevant , we set @xmath23 .",
    "similarly , the frequencies @xmath24 and electronic - nuclear coupling constants @xmath25 of the vibrational modes of the molecular junctions are modeled by a spectral density function@xcite @xmath26 in this paper , the spectral density is chosen in ohmic form with an exponential cutoff @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the dimensionless kondo parameter .",
    "both the electronic and the vibrational continua can be discretized by choosing a density of states @xmath29 and a density of frequencies @xmath30 such that@xcite    @xmath31    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the number of electronic states ( for a single spin / single lead ) and @xmath34 is the number of bath modes in the simulation . in this work ,",

    "various initial states can be considered .",
    "for example , one may choose an initially unoccupied bridge state and the nuclear degrees of freedom equilibrated with this state , i.e. an unshifted bath of oscillators with @xmath50.\\ ] ] on the other hand , one may also start with a fully occupied bridge state and a bath of oscillators in equilibrium with the occupied bridge state @xmath51.\\ ] ] other initial states may also be prepared .",
    "the initial state may affect the transient dynamics profoundly .",
    "the dependence of the steady - state current on the initial density matrix is a more complex issue .",
    "recent investigations for a model without electron - electron interaction seem to indicate that different initial states may lead to different ( quasi)steady states,@xcite although this has been debated.@xcite in this paper , we limit our discussion to physical regimes where the steady state current does not depend on the initial state .",
    "when comparing the time - dependent current from the scattering state representation with that from the original hamiltonian discussed above , we typically choose initial conditions that are close to the final steady state , e.g. , an unoccupied initial bridge state if its energy is higher than the fermi level of the leads and an occupied bridge state otherwise .",
    "we also use the average current @xmath52,\\ ] ] for such a purpose , which minimizes transient effects .    in our simulations the continuous set of electronic states of the leads is represented by a finite number of states .",
    "the number of states required to properly describe the continuum limit depends on the time @xmath53 .",
    "the situation is thus similar to that of a quantum reactive scattering calculation in the presence of a scattering continuum , where , with a finite number of basis functions , an appropriate absorbing boundary condition is added to mimic the correct outgoing green s function.@xcite employing the same strategy for the present problem , the regularized electric current is given by @xmath54    the regularization parameter @xmath55 is similar ( though not identical ) to the formal convergence parameter in the definition of the green s function in terms of the time evolution operator @xmath56 in numerical calculations , @xmath55 is chosen in a similar way as the absorbing potential used in quantum scattering calculations.@xcite in particular , the parameter @xmath55 has to be large enough to accelerate the convergence but still sufficiently small in order not to affect the correct result .",
    "while in the reactive scattering calculation @xmath55 is often chosen to be coordinate dependent , in our simulation @xmath55 is chosen to be time dependent @xmath57 here @xmath58 is a damping constant , @xmath59 is a cutoff time beyond which a steady state charge flow is approximately reached . as the number of electronic states increases , one may choose a weaker damping strength @xmath58 and/or longer cutoff time @xmath59 .",
    "the former approaches zero and the latter approaches infinity for an infinite number of states . for the systems considered in this work , convergence can be reached with a typical @xmath60 30 - 80 fs ( a smaller @xmath59 for less number of states ) and @xmath61 3 - 10 fs .",
    "in previous work @xcite we have used the above hamiltonian with the ml - mctdh - sqr theory for studying vibrationally coupled electron transport through molecular junctions .",
    "it provided important benchmark results to guide further development of the approximate theories .",
    "however , it was also found that upon increasing the bias voltage the number of configurations required in the ml - mctdh representation of the wave function to achieve convergence becomes very large .",
    "this is so even without including the contribution from the nuclear bath , eq .",
    "( [ hel - nuc ] ) , i.e.  for the so - called noninteracting model .",
    "in fact , in many cases , including the vibrational coupling accelerates the convergence of the ml - mctdh - sqr simulation within a given time scale ( see below for a physical explanation ) .",

    "it is advantageous to keep the ( complete ) basis sets as close as possible to the eigenfunctions of the overall hamiltonian .",
    "if this is not done appropriately , one may need a prohibitively large number of basis functions ( i.e. , an `` infinite '' basis in a practical sense ) to obtain numerical convergence , such as what we have observed here . in the discretized scattering state representation ,",
    "the overall current comes from the contribution of all the scattering channels .",

    "on the other hand , other channels that were insignificant previously may now become important .    according to our investigations ,",
    "this numerical problem can be circumvented by noticing the fact that the scattering state representation is not unique . in particular , there is an arbitrariness in defining the bridge state energy , e.g. , one can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ htot ] ) as    @xmath100    @xmath101    with a different choice of @xmath102 , the scattering state operators are different and so will be the performance of the vibronic transport calculation .",

    "it is recognized that for this choice of @xmath102 , the correction to the bridge state energy , @xmath106 , is the reorganization energy ( polaron shift ) for electron transfer between the bridge and the lead states and thus this selection also has a clear physical meaning .    with the choice of the scattering state operators that diagonalize the @xmath107 in eq .",

    "the phonon blockade of the current is usually , qualitatively rationalized by considering the energy level of the bridge state . for any finite bias voltage , the bare energy of the bridge state ( @xmath139 ) is located between the chemical potential of the leads and thus , within a purely electronic model , current can flow . the coupling to the vibrations results in a polaron shift of the energy of the bridge state . for electronic - vibrational coupling strengths",
    "@xmath140 the polaron - shifted energy of the bridge state is below the chemical potentials of both leads and thus the current is blocked .",
    "the comparison between the converged results and those obtained employing only a single spf for the electronic degrees of freedom ( which agree with the results for the purely electronic model ) , demonstrate that this simple picture based on the static energy shift is at best qualitatively correct .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] that the 1 spf ( single configuration ) approach , i.e. , the hartree - fock limit in the scattering state representation , significantly overestimates the steady state current .",
    "the discrepancy becomes larger for stronger electron - nuclear couplings .",
    "it is noted that the results obtained with 1 spf , which neglect true correlation between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom , are very similar to the results obtained with a negf method@xcite ( see , e.g. , the data shown in fig .  9 of ref .  ) . in this method ,",
    "a factorization of the electronic and vibrational green s function is employed . as a consequence ,",
    "correlations between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom are only treated on a very approximate level .",
    "this results , in this case , in a significant overestimation of the current , similar to what would be obtained with a very small ( unconverged ) number of configurations in the ml - mctdh - sqr method .    similar to the examples discussed in sec .",
    "[ large_ed ] , the single configuration limit becomes a better approximation for a higher bias voltage when the vibronic coupling is fixed . for the parameters displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the single configuration result becomes very good for , e.g. , a bias voltage of 1 v ( data not shown ) , similar to that illustrated in fig .",
    "again , in this regime , the negf approach or the landauer formula with the shifted bridge state energy becomes accurate .",
    "it should be emphasized , though , that this also depends on the relative strength between the vibronic coupling and the bias voltage . only for voltages @xmath141 , can it be expected that vibronic effects , and thus also vibrationally induced correlation , are negligible in the steady state current.@xcite as an example , figure  [ fig4]a shows the simulation for a higher voltage of 0.5 v but also a larger reorganization energy 4000  @xmath130 . in this case",
    "12 spfs per electronic sp group are required to obtain the result in the scattering state representation , where the single configuration result is approximately a factor of three too large .",
    "convergence in the original model hamiltonian also becomes more expensive , which requires 64 spfs per electronic sp group .",
    "we finally consider in fig .  [ fig5 ]",
    "an example with a bridge state located at @xmath143 ev .",
    ", i.e. well below the fermi energy .",
    "all other parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for the voltage",
    "considered , this case corresponds to non - resonant transport .",
    "similar to the case @xmath139 , when transforming to the effective hamiltonian in the scattering state representation , the naive procedure outlined in sec .",
    "[ naive ] gives a negative steady - state current .",
    "on the other hand , figure  [ fig5 ] shows the result obtained with employing the modification described in sec .",
    "[ specific ] , which gives excellent agreement with the result obtained with the original model hamiltonian .",
    "the former requires 8 spfs to converge , whereas the latter require 40 spfs . the performance with other voltage / vibronic coupling is similar to the previous figures .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that the scattering state representation of the underlying electronic hamiltonian represents a promising approach for studying vibrationally coupled electron transport through molecular junctions . within the ml - mctdh - sqr theory@xcite",
    "much less configurations are required to achieve convergence than when using the original representation of the hamiltonian .",
    "this is because the transformation to the scattering state representation effectively diagonalizes the underlying electronic hamiltonian and , therefore , much artificial correlation present in the original model is removed .",
    "we have also shown that the definition of the scattering states is not unique .",
    "this can be used to optimize the simulation .",
    "our numerical studies suggest that the form of the hamiltonian outlined in sec .",
    "[ specific ] performs best in all the physical regimes investigated .",
    "the results of our studies also give physical insight into the importance of correlation effects in vibrationally coupled nonequilibrium transport . while for small voltages and/or transient effects , electronic - vibrational correlation is often of utmost importance , for higher voltages correlation effects are less pronounced in the steady state current .",
    "this finding is also of relevance for the validity of negf calculations for vibrationally coupled electron transport , in particular , methods that employ an effective factorization between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom.@xcite    to conclude this paper , we discuss the computational costs of the simulations in the two different representations . as was shown above ,",
    "much less spfs are needed when using the scattering state representation as compared to the original model . however , the transformation used to generate the number operator @xmath84 and the current operator @xmath85 , eq .",
    "( [ backward ] ) , scales quadratically versus the number of the electronic states .",
    "this is in contrast to the original model where the number of electronic operators scales linearly versus the number of electronic states . as a result , there are many more operators to evaluate in the scattering state hamiltonian , which makes the simulation more expensive . for the examples considered in this paper , using 10 spfs per electronic sp group in the scattering model",
    "has a similar computational cost to using 40 spfs in the original model .",
    "therefore , when studying vibrationally coupled electron transport at a lower bias voltage , the original model hamiltonian may be more efficient",
    ".    however , things are quite different when the bias voltage becomes higher , where significant artificial correlation exists in the original model , which makes convergence difficult or even impossible .",
    "the scattering state representation , on the other hand , requires typically a smaller configuration space to converge as demonstrated by the numerical examples in this paper .",
    "this makes the scattering state representation a valuable tool for multiconfigurational study of current - voltage characteristics where the bias voltage spans a larger range .",
    "such work is currently in progress .",
    "our current implementation of the scattering state representation has not yet exploited its full potential .",
    "it is possible that a different energy shift from that of the reorganization energy is more efficient for solving the problem in some physical regimes .",
    "this may be achieved by designing a self - consistent procedure in the convergence tests .",
    "furthermore , a different initial condition for the vibrational bath or even a correlated electronic - vibrational initial density matrix may be helpful in reducing the transient peaks of the current , and thus making the calculation of the steady - state current more stable numerically .",
