    "one signature proposed for the identification of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is a suppressed rate of formation of charmonium bound states , due to the screening effect of the plasma on the linear confining potential that normally binds a @xmath0 pair @xcite . in the presence of this screening",
    ", @xmath0 pairs produced within the plasma presumably separate into open charm mesons , so that the formation of a qgp would be signaled by a decrease in the charmonium production cross section .",
    "this attractively simple picture becomes more complicated if the dissociation cross sections of charmonia on light hadrons are not small . in this case",
    "the charmonia produced during a heavy - ion collision may rescatter into open - charm final states as the result of interactions with the  comoving \" light hadrons produced in the collision .    due to the importance of these cross sections for qgp searches ,",
    "many calculations of near - threshold scattering cross sections of light hadrons on charmonia have recently been reported .",
    "the methods applied include a high energy color - dipole scattering model @xcite , quark models @xcite , meson exchange models @xcite , and most recently qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "under certain simplifying assumptions one may relate experimentally known hadron decays to heavy quarkonium scattering cross sections .",
    "here we consider the dipion decays of heavy quarkonia below open - flavor thresholds , which have been observed in four cases , @xmath12 @xcite , @xmath13 @xcite @xmath14 @xcite and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "these transitions are quite weak , with partial widths of only _ ca . _ 100  kev for @xmath0 and 1@xmath1610  kev for @xmath1 .",
    "they have been observed only because the total widths of the initial heavy quarkonia , which lie below their open - flavor thresholds , are also very small .",
    "we can use these three - body partial widths to estimate pion scattering cross sections of the corresponding heavy quarkonia , since these processes are described by the same invariant amplitudes .",
    "the pion scattering cross sections are given by _ _",
    "1 m_a _ 2 m_b = 164s 1p_i^ 2 _ t_1^t_2 dt |a |^2 where as usual @xmath17 , @xmath18 , the limits are @xmath19 $ ] , and frame - dependent quantities such as @xmath20 and @xmath21 are understood to be evaluated in the c.m .",
    "the corresponding dipion three - body partial width is _ m_b _ 1 _ 2 m_a = 1(2)^3 132 m_b^3 ds dt |a |^2 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( after crossing ) become @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "our eqs.(1,2 ) correspond to eqs.(37.30,21 ) of the 2002 pdg @xcite .",
    "our convention is that @xmath26 is higher in mass than @xmath27 , so the dipion decay @xmath28 is energetically allowed but @xmath29 is not .",
    "the initial and final mesons in the cross section formula eq.(1 ) may be @xmath30 as shown , or they may be transposed to @xmath31 , since the same invariant amplitude @xmath32 is involved . as an example , the decay @xmath33 is related to both @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "since the squared invariant amplitude @xmath36 is sampled in different kinematic regions by the decay and the cross sections ( see fig.1 ) , assumptions regarding the form of @xmath36 are required to relate these various processes . in the following",

    "although the constant amplitude results of the previous section are of interest as order - of - magnitude estimates , it is known experimentally that the invariant amplitudes for these dipion decays show a strong and rather complicated dependence on the @xmath61 invariant mass . in @xmath62 a strong suppression of the @xmath61 system at low invariant",
    "mass is evident ( see for example our fig.4 , or fig.6 of bai _",
    "et al._@xcite ) .",
    "one might have instead expected a near - threshold enhancement , due to the attractive fsi of an s - wave i=0 @xmath61 system .",
    "in contrast , the decay @xmath63 has a complicated double - bump structure , which _ does _ show an enhancement at low @xmath61 invariant mass , as well as a high invariant mass enhancement as seen in @xmath64 .",
    "this difference between the observed @xmath61 distributions suggests that the @xmath61 production amplitude depends significantly on the heavy - quarkonium source , and is not accurately described by a universal @xmath61 amplitude alone .",
    "various theoretical models of these dipion decay amplitudes have appeared in the literature .",
    "they may be divided into three broad categories , according to the mechanism that is assumed to give rise to the strong @xmath65-dependence ; 1 ) gluon radiation models @xcite , 2 ) scalar anomaly models @xcite , and 3 ) scalar meson exchange models @xcite .",
    "the first two categories predict rather similar @xmath65 dependences , so we will consider them together .",
    "there is also a suggestion that chiral symmetry , combined with certain simplifying asumptions for amplitudes , can explain the observed @xmath65 dependence in @xmath64 @xcite ; this model suggests an @xmath65 dependence similar to the first two categories .",
    "finally , we note that several references have considered the decay @xmath11 as a special case , since it has a ",
    "double - humped \" dipion distribution that is not seen in other decays @xcite .",
    "gluon radiation and scalar anomaly models assume that the important low - energy @xmath65 dependence is determined by aspects of a purely gluonic intermediate state . in gluon radiation models",
    "this strong energy dependence arises from a multipole expansion of the gluon emission amplitude , whereas in the scalar anomaly models it is the momentum dependence encountered in coupling the gluonic state to the @xmath61 final state .",
    "clearly it will be difficult to distinguish these two possibilities , although a detailed comparison of their predictions with experiment appears to favor the scalar anomaly model @xcite .    in the scalar anomaly model one can relate the @xmath61 production amplitude to the matrix element of the simplest scalar gluon operator between the vacuum and a @xmath61 state , @xmath66 .",
    "this matrix element can be determined because the operator @xmath67 is proportional to the triangle anomaly in the trace of the energy - momentum tensor , which in a low energy pion effective lagrangian is quadratic in the pion field .",
    "the matrix element of this operator gives a near - threshold dependence of @xmath68 , which is @xmath69 in our kinematics .",
    "meson exchange models assume that the @xmath61 system is produced by an intermediate scalar @xmath70 meson ( often referred to as the  @xmath71 \" ) , and the observed @xmath65-dependence at higher invariant mass is due primarily to this meson .",
    "fits to the dipion decay data ( excluding the problematical @xmath11 ) typically prefer a light , broad state with a mass near 0.5  gev ; see for example @xcite .",
    "ideally we would cross an accurate model of the @xmath61 production amplitudes into the @xmath72 scattering regime to estimate @xmath73 closed - flavor cross sections , but this is not yet possible because no model gives a good simultaneous description of all the experimentally observed @xmath0 and @xmath1 dipion mass distributions .",
    "for the present we will simply assume the near - threshold @xmath65 dependences suggested by the existing models , and evaluate the cross sections predicted for @xmath74 in each case .",
    "for the gluon radiation and scalar anomaly models we assume |a(s , t)|^2 = c_2 t^2  . for a power - law form",
    "@xmath75 , the relation between decays and cross sections eq.(3 ) generalizes as follows ; the decay rate eq.(2 ) becomes    _",
    "m_b _ a = 1256 ^3 m_b^3 c_n i^(n ) where @xmath76 is the integral of @xmath77 over the @xmath28 dalitz plot , ^(n ) ds dt t^n  .",
    "the constant @xmath78 is determined by the measured dipion partial width using eq.(6 ) , and substitution of @xmath79 into the cross section formula eq.(1 ) then gives -3 cm _ _ a _ b = _ m_b _ a ( |t_1|^n+1 - |t_2|^n+1 )  .",
    "we again specialize to the process @xmath74 . setting @xmath80 ( scalar anomaly models ) , for eq.(7 )",
    "we find @xmath81  gev@xmath82 .",
    "the cross section in eq.(8 ) may then be evaluated numerically , which gives the result shown in fig.5 .",
    "note that the scalar anomaly model leads to a rapid increase of the cross section relative to the constant amplitude model above @xmath83  gev .",
    "this is due to the @xmath84-weighting combined with the rapid increase in the range of @xmath23 covered by this reaction with increasing @xmath85 , which is evident in fig.1 ( lower right region ) .",
    "finally , for our meson exchange model we assume a generalized breit - wigner form which incorporates the scalar anomaly soft - pion factor . for @xmath86",
    "this is |a(s , t)|^2 = where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the mass and width of the hypothetical scalar meson source of the @xmath61 events .",
    "we have incorporated the @xmath84 scalar anomaly soft - pion dependence in eq.(9 ) because pure breit - wigner forms required an unrealistically narrow @xmath70 ( @xmath89-@xmath90  mev ) and gave rather poor fits to the data .",
    "in contrast the hybrid form eq.(9 ) clearly gives an acceptable fit ( fig.4 ) , although we emphasize that _ this meson exchange model is unphysical _ because the fitted parameters @xmath91  mev and @xmath92  mev are inconsistent with the experimental i=0 @xmath61 s - wave phase shift .",
    "we can again use eqs.(1,2 ) to determine the cross section for @xmath57 implied by this decay model ( ignoring the problem of disagreement with phase shifts ) .",
    "the result is -3 cm _ _ a _ b = _ m_b _ a _",
    "t_1^t_2  .",
    "note that this integration is over negative values of @xmath23 , whereas the decay rate integral is over positive @xmath23 , which leads to different signs in the breit - wigner functions .",
    "the dalitz plot decay integral _ f_0 ds dt  . for @xmath93 equals @xmath94  gev@xmath95 given our external meson masses and fitted @xmath70 parameters .",

    "fujii and kharzeev @xcite have also evaluated closed - flavor charmonium cross sections , using a color - dipole scattering model .",
    "they do not use dipion decay data as a direct input , although they do note that their two results for the rate @xmath98 are not far from experiment .    in the earliest reference @xcite ,",

    "their cross section close to threshold is shown in fig.6 , and is evidently qualitatively similar to our scalar anomaly model result .",

    "( their form factor is inferred from the i=0 @xmath61 s - wave phase shift . ) their results without a form factor are similar to the earlier predictions . with a form factor",
    "they find a much smaller cross section , which is rather close to our scalar meson exchange result .",
    "the search for the quark gluon plasma has led to great interest in the scale of the cross sections of heavy quarkonia interacting with light hadrons near threshold .",
    "unfortunately , little is known about these cross sections experimentally . in this paper",
    "we have used crossing symmetry and several simple amplitude models to estimate the closed - flavor cross sections for heavy quarkonia scattering on pions near threshold , using the experimentally known dipion decays as input .",

    "note that of the three forms we have assumed , only the lowest cross section ( meson exchange model ) gives a good fit to the observed @xmath61 distribution ( fig.4 ) .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we note that the strong dependence of the decay amplitude on @xmath103 observed experimentally in the dipion decays near threshold makes analytic continuation to the pion scattering regime rather problematic .",
    "the dependence of the cross section for @xmath101 ( used as our example ) on the different model amplitudes is clearly evident even near threshold ( fig.5 ) . for this reaction",
    "the various models we considered gave consistent cross sections of @xmath104-@xmath105b at e@xmath106  gev , but the predictions diverged rapidly with increasing invariant mass .",
    "in future , high statistics studies of dipion decays at cleo might provide additional useful information about the decay amplitude .",
    "in particular , it would be useful to accurately determine the @xmath22 dependence of the decay amplitude in the dalitz plot of fig.1 experimentally , in addition to the already well known @xmath107 dependence .",
    "we note in passing that the cross sections for these near - threshold closed - flavor processes are much smaller than the millibarn scale typically found for open - flavor reactions such as @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "the possibility that the rather weak closed - flavor reactions are due to open - flavor scattering at second order @xcite , rather than to exchange of an unphysically light scalar meson , is an interesting suggestion which merits future investigation .",
