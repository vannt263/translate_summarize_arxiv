    "isolated quantum systems evolve unitarily according to the schrdinger equation , while an open quantum system , which is inevitably coupled to a heat bath in practical , usually quickly lose all its quantum coherence .",
    "that is , all the off - diagonal terms of the density matrix of the system @xmath1 ( in the energy representation ) will decay to zero when the open system approaches the steady state @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is called decoherence , and it is also believed that this is why our world appears as a classical one and no macroscopic superposition can exist stably in usual cases @xcite .",
    "it has been reported that if some non - vanishing steady quantum coherence exists in certain special environment , even with a quite small amount , it can result to some novel physics , such as lasing without inversion @xcite , or extracting work from a single heat bath @xcite .",
    "then an important question arises : how can quantum coherence survive stably in the steady state against decoherence @xcite ? in this paper , we find that the steady quantum coherence can indeed exist stably when the system contacts with a non - equilibrium environment , which is composed of multiple equilibrium heat baths at different temperatures . here",
    "we study the steady state of a three - level system , which is coupled to two heat baths with temperatures @xmath2 respectively ( fig.[fig - ne ] ) .",
    "we find that , for the @xmath0-type and v - type systems , non - vanishing quantum coherence can exist in the steady state when the temperatures of the two heat baths are different .",
    "moreover , the amount of the nonzero off - diagonal terms increase with the temperature difference @xmath3 of the two heat baths . while the quantum coherence always vanishes in a @xmath4-type system . here",
    "we must emphasize that , unlike previous studies @xcite , in our model there is no quantum coherence in the environment in priori , and the steady quantum coherence in the system is naturally brought in by the non - equilibrium environment .",
    ".,scaledwidth=38.0% ]    physically , this steady quantum coherence results from the interference of transitions in non - equilibrium systems . in the three kinds of three - level systems we study , there are two transition pathways , and there exist interferences between the transitions for the @xmath0-type and v - type systems @xcite .",
    "we have to point out that such interferences were often omitted by secular approximations in many previous literatures @xcite . here",
    "we show that this omission is consistent for equilibrium environments , i.e. , when all the temperatures of different baths equal to each other and thus they become a whole equilibrium heat bath .",
    "however , in non - equilibrium systems , such omission of interference between transitions would lead to the neglect of the steady quantum coherence , and that would also lead to some other unphysical results @xcite .",
    "moreover , in a simple example we will show that the quantum coherence exactly reflects the non - equilibrium flux inside a composite system , thus it has a clear physical meaning and should not be neglected in non - equilibrium systems @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we derive a master equation for a @xmath0-type system contacting with two heat baths , and discuss the effect of secular approximation . in sec.iii , we show that non - vanishing quantum coherence can exist in the non - equilibrium steady state of the @xmath0-type system , if we take into account the interferences between transitions and do not apply the secular approximation .",
    "we also give the condition for the existence of steady quantum coherence . in sec.iv , we show that steady quantum coherence can also appear in v - type systems , but can not appear in @xmath4-type systems . in sec.v , we show that the quantum coherence reflects the non - equilibrium flux inside a composite system .",
    "finally we draw conclusions in sec.vi .",
    "we first consider a @xmath0-type system contacting with two independent heat baths ( bath-@xmath5 ) with different temperatures @xmath2 .",
    "we derive a master equation via born - markovian approximation to describe the dynamics of the open quantum system .",
    "especially , we consider what physical process has been ignored in the conventional secular approximation during the derivation of the master equation .",
    "we consider a @xmath0-type system [ see fig.[fig-3ls](a ) ] , which is described by the hamiltonian @xmath6 where we denote the three energy levels by @xmath7 ( the lower two states ) and @xmath8 ( the highest excited state ) correspondingly , with eigen energy @xmath9 and @xmath10 .    due to the interaction with the environment , there are two transitions in the system , i.e. , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . here",
    "we use the lowering and raising operators to represent these two transitions , denoted as @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively for @xmath15 .",

    "there is a relation between the cross spectrums @xmath31 and the individual spectrums @xmath35 , shown as follows ( see the proof in [ sec : correlated - spectrum ] ) , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a weight factor and @xmath38 .",
    "if @xmath39 , it means there is no interference between transitions .",
    "in some special cases , we have @xmath40 , which means the interference effect achieves the maximum . in general cases ,",
    "the concrete form of @xmath37 depends on the form of coupling strength @xmath41 in specific physical systems @xcite ( see also the example in [ sec : correlated - spectrum ] ) .",
    "for example , in quantum optics , the weight factor @xmath37 is equivalent to the @xmath42 parameter which measures the angle between the transition dipole moments @xcite .",
    "we can understand the physical meaning of each summation term in the master equation ( [ eq : me ] ) as a second order process .",
    "in fact , due to the interaction with the environment , the system first absorbs an energy quanta from the environment through the transition @xmath43 , and then immediately followed by emitting an energy quanta through transition @xmath44 back to the environment .",
    "and the reversed process also happens , namely , the system first emits an energy quanta through transition @xmath45 , and then absorbs through transition @xmath46 .",
    "if these two successive energy exchange processes experience the same transition ( @xmath47 ) , the total process is stable . while if these two processes experience two different transitions ( @xmath48 ) , which usually have different energies , the total process , with an oscillating factor @xmath49 , is often considered to be not stable , which will averagely vanish to zero after oscillations for several periods @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "we call them cross transitions , and these terms results from the interference of the two transitions .",
    "it was believed that such cross transition terms would have no effect after a long enough oscillating time @xmath51 @xcite , and they do not contribute to the steady state ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "for this reason , the secular approximation is often applied to eq.([eq : me ] ) , and only the terms with @xmath53 are remained .",
    "then we obtain a time - independent lindblad master equation @xcite , @xmath54 we should notice that all the cross transition terms are omitted by the secular approximation in this master equation .    here",
    "we make some clarification on our terminology in this paper .",
    "when we say `` secular approximation '' , we mean the omission of the cross transition terms we mentioned above with energy difference @xmath55 . when we say `` rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) ''",
    ", we mean the omission of double creation or annihilation terms , for example , in the derivation of jaynes - cummings coupling from dipole interaction @xcite .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian we used in eq.([eq : h_sb ] ) is usually obtained via rwa in real physics system .    for the master equation ( [ eq : me - secular ] ) with secular approximation ,",
    "the equations for the diagonal and off - diagonal terms of @xmath56 are decoupled @xcite , and we can obtain a rate equation only involving the populations @xmath57 and @xmath58 of each energy level as follows , @xmath59 we notice that @xmath60 .    setting @xmath61 in the rate equation ( [ eq : rate ] ) , we obtain the steady population of the open quantum system , that is , @xmath62 we see that no matter whether the environment is in equilibrium , we always obtain a steady state of a diagonal form @xmath63 , and all the off - diagonal terms of @xmath64 vanish .",
    "thus , using the master equation ( [ eq : me - secular ] ) with secular approximation , we always obtain a solution where no quantum coherence is left after a long - time evolution .    here",
    "we make some clarification about the concept of `` quantum coherence '' we mention in this paper .",
    "intuitively , people usually say there is quantum coherence when there are some nonzero off - diagonal terms in the density matrix , but for any density matrix , we can always make it diagonalized in a certain basis .",
    "thus it seems that the concept of quantum coherence is not free of representation @xcite .",
    "however , the energy representation is distinctive from others .",
    "the canonical thermal state is diagonal only in the energy representation .",
    "therefore , in this paper , when we say there is quantum coherence , we mean that the density matrix @xmath56 of the system has some non - zero off - diagonal terms in the energy representation @xcite .",

    "we also need to emphasize that the two states , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , which have steady quantum coherence between them , do not need to be degenerated , which is different from what has been studied in previous literatures @xcite .",
    "we need to emphasize that the steady quantum coherence we obtained above is not resulted from the `` decoherence - free subspace '' ( dfs ) @xcite , and there is no dfs in this model .",
    "for a system with dfs , the states in the dfs are decoupled from the environment , and they evolve unitarily . the quantum coherence protected in the dfs",
    "is determined by the initial state , and there does not exist a unique steady state in such systems .",
    "however , in our model , the steady state , which is obtained from eq.([eq : steady ] ) , is unique and does not depend on the initial state , thus there is no dfs here and the steady coherence in this model is not resulted from the dfs .",
    "now we show that when the temperature difference @xmath3 decreases to zero exactly , i.e. , when we return to case of an equilibrium heat bath with a single temperature , the steady quantum coherence also vanishes completely . in this case",

    "besides the equilibrium case , there is another case that the condition ( [ eq : zero - condition ] ) still hold even for non - equilibrium environment .",

    "we have @xmath157\\\\   & = -i2g\\mathrm{tr}\\big[\\rho(|e_{2}\\rangle\\langle e_{1}|-|e_{1}\\rangle\\langle e_{2}|)\\big]=4g\\im\\mathrm{m}\\langle e_{1}|\\rho|e_{2}\\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the above calculation is completed with the help of eq.([eq : eigen ] ) .",
    "the above equation clearly shows that the non - equilibrium flux between the two tlss @xmath158 is exactly reflected by the imaginary part of the quantum coherence term @xmath159 @xcite .",
    "if the two heat baths have the same temperature , there is no net heat transfer , and the steady quantum coherence automatically vanishes , which is just consistent with what we have discussed above .",
    "therefore , the quantum coherence exactly reflects the non - equilibrium flux inside a composite system .",
    "if the steady quantum coherence is missed , the internal flux inside the composite system would also be omitted improperly , which leads to an unphysical conclusion that there is no net flux between the local sites even when the two heat baths have different temperatures .",
    "in this paper , we studied the steady state of a three - level system in a non - equilibrium environment , which consists of two heat baths with different temperatures .",
    "we find that for the @xmath0-type and v - type systems , the interference between transitions can give rise to non - vanishing steady quantum coherence , if the two transitions couple to the two heat baths with different proportions of coupling strengths .",
    "and the amount of the steady quantum coherence increases with the temperature difference of the two heat baths .",
    "if the two heat baths have the same temperature , all the quantum coherence vanishes and returns to the equilibrium case .",
    "these transition structures are quite common in natural and artificial quantum systems .",
    "the non - equilibrium environment can be implemented via current noises with different effective temperatures in quantum circuits @xcite , or electron leads with different chemical potentials @xcite .",
    "the interference between transitions play an essential role in the steady quantum coherence .",
    "but it was often omitted by secular approximation in previous literatures .",
    "we showed that indeed the secular approximation is consistent in the case of equilibrium environment , but for non - equilibrium environments , that would lead to the neglect of the steady quantum coherence .",
    "we also show that the quantum coherence has a clear physical meaning , i.e. , it exactly reflects the internal non - equilibrium flux inside a composite system , which is an important characterization of non - equilibrium systems .    notice that many current investigations about non - equilibrium quantum thermodynamics are based on the rate equation of the energy level populations like eq.([eq : rate ] ) , which does not include the quantum coherence .",
    "our result implies that some further refinement , which takes into account the quantum coherence , should be made to the present study of non - equilibrium quantum thermodynamics @xcite .",

    "here we derive a relation of the cross spectrum .",
    "when we have two transitions contacting with the same environment , we need three coupling spectrums , i.e. , two individual spectrum for each transition , @xmath33 , and another cross spectrum @xcite for the cross transition , @xmath174 .",
    "these spectrums are defined as          if @xmath183 is a one - to - one map , we have @xmath184",
    ". then the above relation holds and further we have @xmath185 in more general cases , for example , the environment is the electromagnetic field or the phonon field , with the index @xmath186 as a vector , the mode energy @xmath187 has degeneracy in different directions of @xmath186",
    ". if the amplitudes @xmath188 are the same , the modes with different directions have the same energy @xmath187 . in these cases , if the coupling coefficients @xmath189 only depend on the amplitude @xmath190 , i.e. , only depend on @xmath187 equivalently , the relation ( [ eq : gg=00003dgg ] ) still holds , and we still have @xmath191 , as used in many literatures @xcite .    except the above two cases , the equality ( [ eq : f=00003d1 ] )",
    "usually does not hold , and the general relation between the cross spectrum @xmath174 and the individual spectrums @xmath33 appear as @xcite @xmath192 where @xmath193 is a weight factor . in general cases ,",
    "the concrete form of @xmath194 depends on the form of coupling strength @xmath195 in specific physical systems .",
    "for example , two two - level atoms stay at position @xmath196 and @xmath197 in the same electromagnetic field , and they separate from each other for a distance @xmath198 .",
    "their coupling strengths with the electromagnetic field have a relation @xmath199 $ ] .",
    "the light emitted from the two atoms can interfere with each other . in this case",
    ", we can check that the weight factor has the form of @xmath200 .",
    "it varies with the distance @xmath201 , and depends on the dimensionality @xmath202 of the electromagnetic field , i.e. , @xmath203^{2 } , & d=2,\\\\ \\text{sinc}^{2}(x ) , & d=3 , \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath204 is the bessel function of the first kind @xcite . when the two atoms are quite near to each other , their interference effect achieve the maximum .",
    "when they are far from each other , their interference effect quickly decays with the distance ( for @xmath205 ) .",
    "thus the weight function @xmath200 here describe the spatial correlation of the environment .",
