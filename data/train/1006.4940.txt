    "to solve complicated problems in economics , engineering and environment , we can not successfully use classical methods because of different kinds of incomplete knowledge , typical for those problems .",
    "there are four theories : theory of probablity , fuzzy set theory ( fst ) @xcite , interval mathematics and rough set theory ( rst ) @xcite , which we can consider as mathematical tools for dealing with imperfect knowledge .",
    "all these tools require the pre - specification of some parameter to start with , e.g. probablity density function in probablity theory , membership function in fst and an equivalence relation in rst .",
    "such a requirement , seen in the backdrop of imperfect or incomplete knowledge , raises many problems . at the same time",
    ", incomplete knowledge remains the most glaring characteristic of humanistic systems ",
    "systems exemplified by economic systems , biological systems , social systems , political systems , information systems and , more generally , man - machine systems of various types .    noting problems in parameter specification molodtsov",
    "@xcite introduced the notion of soft set to deal with problems of incomplete information .",
    "soft set theory ( sst ) does not require the specification of a parameter , instead it accommodates approximate descriptions of an object as its starting point .",
    "this makes sst a natural mathematical formalism for approximate reasoning .",
    "we can use any parametrization we prefer : with the help of words , sentences , real numbers , functions , mappings , and so on .",
    "this means that the problem of setting the membership function or any similar problem does not arise in sst .",
    "sst has seminal links with rough set technique of automated knowledge discovery .",
    "soft set being collection of information granules , bears a close resemblance with rough sets .",
    "a rough set @xcite is defined to be a set given by an upper and a lower approximation sets from a universe of information granules .",
    "aktas and cagman @xcite have shown that , both , an arbitrary rough set or an arbitrary fuzzy set may be expressed as a soft set .",
    "hence soft set theory is more general a set up than rst and/or fst .",
    "links between soft sets and information systems and hence to rough set theory , have been further studied in @xcite . on the other hand , techniques from rst",
    "have been found applicable to sst , due to the affinity of both approaches .",
    "maji , biswas and roy @xcite applied the technique of knowledge reduction to the information table induced by a soft set .",
    "another parametrization reduction of soft set was proposed in @xcite .",
    "recently z. kong _ et.al .",
    "_ has also proposed yet another novel method of parameter reduction in sfst08konb .",
    "applications of soft set theory in other disciplines and real life problems are now catching momentum .",
    "molodtsov @xcite successfully applied the soft set theory into several directions , such as smoothness of functions , riemann - integration , perron integration , theory of probability , theory of measurement and so on .",
    "kovkov _ et.al .",
    "_ @xcite has found promising results by applying soft sets to optimization theory , game theory and operations research .",
    "maji and roy @xcite applied soft sets in a multicriteria decision making ( mcdm ) problem .",
    "it is based on the notion of knowledge reduction of rough sets .",
    "mushrif and sengupta sfst06mus based their algorithm for natural texture classification on soft sets .",
    "this algorithm has a low computational complexity when compared to a bayes technique based method for texture classification .",
    "zou and xia sfst08zou have exploited the link between soft sets and data analysis in incomplete information systems .    in this paper , we first introduce the notion of mapping on soft classes .",
    "soft classes are collections of soft sets ( definition [ df_sftclass ] ) .",
    "we also define and study the properties of soft images and soft inverse images of soft sets , and support them with examples and counterexamples .",
    "finally , these notions have been applied to the problem of medical diagnosis in medical expert systems .",
