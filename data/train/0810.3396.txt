    "having crossed the boundaries between theory and experiment , i attest that the experimenter feels like a hapless ant crawling on a desk , as far as searching for new physics ( np ) @xmath0 violation ( cpv ) is concerned .",
    "take , for example , the belle _",
    "_ paper  @xcite on the difference in direct cpv between @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) . in reporting a large deviation ,",
    "belle cited the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) as the reason to pursue cpv studies , but immediately admitted that all data support the unique kobayashi ",
    "maskawa ( km ,  @xcite ) source of cpv in the standard model ( sm ) , which is  known to be too small \" ( by @xmath1  @xcite at least ) for bau .",
    "because the gap ( which the general experimenter knows only vaguely ) between sm and the heavenly bau is so large , it appears insurmountable , no matter what is found in the laboratory .",
    "it is truly remarkable that the sm has  @xcite all the necessary ingredients for baryogenesis , i.e. the sakharov conditions of baryon number violation , cpv , and deviation from equilibrium ( in the very hot early universe ) .",
    "the agony is the insufficiency in the latter two : cpv is way to small , while the electroweak phase transition ( ewpht ) seems only a crossover .",
    "we see no antibaryons in our universe , i.e. @xmath10 , while @xmath11 ( wmap ) ; bau is 100% . but",
    "the folklore is that sm falls short by @xmath1 .",
    "the source of this is the jarlskog invariant  @xcite , @xmath12 which incorporates all requirements for cpv to be nonvanishing , where @xmath13 is twice the area of any unitarity triangle .",
    "note that @xmath14 has dimensions @xmath15 . to compare with @xmath16 ,",
    "one typically normalizes by the ewpht temperature @xmath17 gev ( or roughly the v.e.v .",
    "putting in quark masses , and our knowledge that @xmath18 , one immediately finds @xmath19 , which falls short by @xmath1 .",
    "the main source of suppression is the smallness of light quark masses .",
    "the situation is in general much worse , since there are coupling constant factors as well .",
    "  _ we observe that , by extending from 3 to 4 quark generations , one can enhance eq .  [ eq : j3 ] by over @xmath3 _",
    "    the thread that lead to this observation appeared concurrent with the 2004 observation of direct cpv in @xmath20 mode , i.e. the first hint of @xmath21 .",
    "written into the belle paper  @xcite at that time , it was noted that if the electroweak penguin @xmath22 ( @xmath23 penguin really ) is the source of this apparent difference , then np cpv is implied .",
    "however , as is well known , the so - called color - suppressed tree diagram @xmath24 could also generate @xmath25 .",
    "although peskin  @xcite stressed the equal possibility of @xmath24 vs @xmath26 origins in his companion _ nature _ paper , privately he is  very skeptical that the new belle result is new physics \" .",
    "so , with the gap of @xmath1 in mind , the hapless ant crawls on .",
    "noticing that the @xmath22 ( or the @xmath23 penguin ) , where the @xmath23 is radiated off a virtual top or @xmath27 in a @xmath28 loop and turns into a @xmath29 ( but not a @xmath30 ) , i recalled my first b paper on @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "naive counting would lead one to conclude that the photonic penguin diagram , at @xmath32 , would dominate over the @xmath23 penguin , at @xmath33 . even if one notes that the two differ by @xmath34 in dimensions , one would still have @xmath35 .",
    "but it turns out , by direct computation , or by argument of conserved vector current vs spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , that the @xmath23 penguin behaves as @xmath36 and actually dominates .",
    "this is called _ nondecoupling _ of heavy chiral quark masses in sm .",
    "i therefore embarked on crawling up the little hill of adding a 4th generation .",
    "but this usually appears as running against a wall in a quixotic way ; the 4th generation has long been viewed by many as ruled out already , by neutrino counting and electroweak precision tests ( ewprt ) .",
    "however , we now know that neutrinos have mass , which calls for new physics , while kribs _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite recently pointed out that the 4th generation is not in such great conflict with ewprt . in any case",
    ", we demonstrated , both at lo  @xcite and nlo  @xcite in pqcd factorization approach ( the only one that predicted the size and sign of @xmath37 ) , that the 4th generation can generate the observed @xmath38 . in ref .",
    "@xcite we showed that @xmath39 and @xmath40 moved downwards by @xmath41 , which is the right direction and consistent with current data .",
    "both the sign and strength are nontrivial .",
    "@xmath42 is rather large for a np effect .",
    "given that the @xmath43 box diagram has similar @xmath44 dependence as in the @xmath28 @xmath23 penguin , with the cdf measurement of @xmath45 mixing , a very sizable , and _ negative _ , mixing - dependent cpvis predicted  @xcite for @xmath46 , i.e. @xmath47 compared with @xmath48 .",
    "the range of @xmath49 to @xmath50 was already predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite and reported  @xcite at ichep 2006 in moscow .",
    "the improvement of eq .",
    "[ eq : sin2phibs ] came with the more precisely determined @xmath45 mixing , while the sign is determined by the sign of @xmath9 .",
    "so at ichep 2006 , i already asked  can large cpv in @xmath45 mixing be measured @ tevatron ? \" , and pronounced that the case is good for the tevatron ( vs lhcb , which comes on later ) .",
    "interestingly , by end of 2007 , cdf reported  @xcite indications for @xmath51 that is consistent with eq .",
    "[ eq : sin2phibs ] , but less consistent with the sm expectation . by this conference",
    ", the d@xmath52 measurement  @xcite and a cdf update  @xcite both confirm this trend , and the combined deviation from sm is now  @xcite more than 2@xmath53 , with central value of @xmath54 !",
    "this incredible development makes 20092010 very interesting , whether lhcb arrives on the scene or not .",
    "heavy sm chiral quark effects are nondecoupled in the box and @xmath23 penguin diagrams .",
    "the source is both because of the subtleties of spontaneous ewsb , and that heavy quark masses are due to large yukawa couplings to the v.e.v .",
    "this i knew since twenty some years .",
    "stimulated by large @xmath9 , in the past 4 years i could not stop from pushing the work on the 4th generation , utilizing large @xmath55 yukawa couplings , and cpv phase in @xmath56 .",
    "i can not remember when and how , but one day the ",
    "yureka(wa ) \" moment came : large yukawa couplings can modify eq .",
    "[ eq : j3 ] !",
    "if one shifts by one generation with 4th generation sm ( sm4 ) , then eq .",
    "[ eq : j3 ] becomes  @xcite @xmath57 the notation will be clarified soon , but it is clear that the difference of light quark mass pairs , @xmath58 now all drop out , and one gains in the mass factors ( assuming @xmath59 gev ) by @xmath3 ! for the change in cpv  area \" @xmath13 , if the hints from @xmath9 and @xmath6 hold up , one could gain a further factor of 30 .    to illustrate this last point , we show in figure  [ bdbstri ] the @xmath28 quadrangle corresponding to the sm4 unitarity relation @xmath60 , together with the sm3 @xmath61 triangle @xmath62 .",
    "the latter is from the current 3 generation fit to all data , the success of which lead to km receiving the 2008 nobel prize . for the former ,",
    "it comes from the program  @xcite that started with @xmath9 ( fixes @xmath56 for given @xmath63 ) , but incorporating the @xmath64 and rare kaon constraints on @xmath65 and @xmath66 , using unitarity of @xmath67 ckm matrix .    -1.8 cm",
    "-1.5 cm    we note that , if one draws the line linking @xmath68 and @xmath69 in figure  [ bdbstri ] , the rather squashed and elongated triangle corresponds to @xmath70 for sm3 , the 3 generation sm .",
    "this triangle has the same area @xmath71 as the @xmath72 triangle .",
    "it is the very tiny phase angle of the @xmath28 triangle in sm3 at the vertex @xmath68 that gives rise to the very small value of @xmath73 .",
    "the sign , which is opposite to @xmath74 , is because the  orientation \" is opposite that of the sm3 @xmath72 triangle .",
    "the large phase angle in sm4 at vertex @xmath68 leads to the large area of the quadrangle , or @xmath75 , hence our prediction of eq .",
    "[ eq : sin2phibs ] .    why do the @xmath72 processes give a triangle , rather than a quadrangle , if there are 4th generation effects lurking in @xmath76 transitions ?",
    "this question was dealt with in ref .",
    "@xcite : with large @xmath56 ( including cpv phase ) , after taking into account the @xmath64 and rare kaon constraints , the actual @xmath72 quadrangle mimics the sm3 triangle , or @xmath72 transitions are sm - like .",
    "this is a nontrivial test , and indeed , another possible solution is rejected by this .",
    "the original jarlskog invariant of eq .",
    "[ eq : j3 ] was derived  @xcite using @xmath77 \\equiv { \\rm im}\\det\\bigl[s,\\;s'\\bigr]$ ] .",

    "the 4 generation world actually becomes the effectively 3 generation world of 2 - 3 - 4 generation quarks !",
    "one sees now why eq .",
    "[ eq : j234 ] would turn out to be by far the dominant , and why @xmath14 in eq .",
    "[ eq : j3 ] , which could be written as @xmath84 , is so tiny ( the @xmath1 gap ! ) .    out of the 3 independent phases in sm4 , one",
    "is already measured in @xmath72 transitions , one could be emerging in a spectacular way in @xmath28 transitions .",
    "a third subdominant phase can be glimpsed from figure  [ bdbstri ] . since @xmath85 is small , the resulting triangle by shrinking @xmath86 is not much different from the quadrangle .",
    "thus , we have been a little cavalier in the notation of @xmath87 , but again there is no doubt that @xmath88 of eq .",
    "[ eq : j234 ] is the predominant cpv effect in sm4 , and the relevant one for bau .",
    "judging from the combined @xmath89 enhancement from @xmath14 to @xmath88 , it seems sufficient to overcome the large gap of @xmath1 , even taking into account the gauge factors that we have alluded to .",
    "what about ewpht ?",
    "it is claimed that a first order transition is not possible for sm4  @xcite .",
    "but perhaps strong yukawa couplings , beyond the unitarity limit of heavy @xmath55 and @xmath90 masses ( perturbativity is lost ) , opens a new possibility , as ewsb itself could be through the nambu  jona - lasinio  @xcite mechanism with large yukawa couplings .",
    "given the developments at the tevatron on @xmath6 in the past year  @xcite , 2009 appears extremely interesting , while lhcb may not deliver physics even by 2010 .",
    "judging from the recent performance of the tevatron accelerator and experiments , if the current central value ( consistent with eq .",
    "[ eq : sin2phibs ] ! ) stays , we would have evidence in 2009 , perhaps even observation in 2010 , _ if tevatron could continue running beyond 2009_. regardless , once lhcb has of order 0.5 fb@xmath91 data _ analyzed _ , whether one has np cpv enhancement or not , the whole situation would precipitate .    but measurement of large @xmath6 , while exciting , does not constitute proof for a 4th generation . the real litmus test , as always , would be direct search .",
    "current cdf limit gives @xmath92 gev at 90% c.l .",
    ", using 2.8 fb@xmath91 data .",
    "again , once lhc data becomes available , the full terrain can be covered in a straightforward way .",
    "the gain of @xmath3 ( @xmath89 if @xmath93 gev is used ) in mass factors of eq .",
    "[ eq : j234 ] with 4 generations , over eq .",
    "[ eq : j3 ] with only 3 generations , seem to give enough cpv for generating bau .",
    "_ maybe there is a 4th generation . _    in several years we should know whether the km mechanism  with 4th generations  could provide sufficient cpv for bau .",
