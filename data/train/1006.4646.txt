    "state complexity is a type of descriptional complexity based on _ deterministic finite automaton _ ( dfa ) model .",
    "the state complexity of an operation on regular languages is the number of states that are necessary and sufficient in the worst case for the minimal , complete dfa that accepts the resulting language of the operation .",
    "while many results on the state complexities of individual operations , such as union , intersection , catenation , star , reversal , shuffle , orthogonal catenation , proportional removal , and cyclic shift  @xcite , have been obtained in the past 15 years , the research of state complexities of combined operations , which was initiated by a. salomaa , k. salomaa , and s. yu in 2007  @xcite , is attracting more attention .",
    "this is because , in practice , a combination of several individual operations , rather than only one individual operation , is often performed in a certain order .",
    "for example , in order to obtain a precise regular expression , a combination of basic operations is usually required .    in recent publications",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that the state complexity of a combined operation is not always a simple mathematical composition of the state complexities of its component operations .",
    "this is sometimes due to the structural properties of the dfa accepting the resulting language obtained from a prior operation of a combined operation .",
    "for example , the languages that are obtained from performing reversal and reach the upper bound of the state complexity of this operation are accepted by dfas such that half of their states are final ; and the initial state of the dfa accepting a language obtained after performing star is always a final state . as a result , the resulting language obtained from a prior operation may not be among the worst cases of the subsequent operation .",
    "since such issues are not concerned by the study of the state complexity of individual operations , they are certainly important in the research of the state complexity of combined operations .",
    "although the number of combined operations is unlimited and it is impossible to study the state complexities of all of them , the study on combinations of two individual operations is clearly necessary .    in this paper",
    ", we study the state complexities of reversal combined with catenation , i.e. , @xmath0 , and star combined with catenation , i.e. , @xmath1 , for minimal complete dfas @xmath2 and @xmath3 of sizes @xmath4 , respectively . for @xmath0",
    ", we will show that the general upper bound @xmath5 , which is close to the composition of the state complexities of reversal and catenation @xmath6 , is reachable when @xmath7 , and it can be lower to @xmath8 and @xmath9 when @xmath10 and @xmath11 and when @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively . for @xmath1 , we will show that , if @xmath2 has only one final state and it is also the initial state , i.e. , @xmath14 , the state complexity of catenation ( also @xmath1 ) is @xmath15 , which is lower than that of catenation @xmath16 . in the other cases , that is when @xmath2 contains some final states that are not the initial state , the state complexity of @xmath1 is @xmath17 instead of @xmath18 , the composition of the state complexities of star and catenation .    in the next section",
    ", we introduce the basic definitions and notations used in the paper .",
    "then , we prove our results on reversal combined with catenation and star combined with catenation in sections  [ sec : rev - cat ] and  [ sec : star - cat ] , respectively .",
    "we conclude the paper in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "a dfa is denoted by a 5-tuple @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the finite set of states , @xmath21 is the finite input alphabet , @xmath22 is the state transition function , @xmath23 is the initial state , and @xmath24 is the set of final states .",
    "a dfa is said to be complete if @xmath25 is defined for all @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "all the dfas we mention in this paper are assumed to be complete .",
    "we extend @xmath28 to @xmath29 in the usual way .    a _ non - deterministic finite automaton _ ( nfa )",
    "is denoted by a 5-tuple @xmath19 , where the definitions of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are the same to those of dfas , but the state transition function @xmath28 is defined as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 denotes the power set of @xmath20 , i.e. the set of all subsets of @xmath20 .    in this paper , the state transition function @xmath28 is often extended to @xmath34 . the function @xmath35 is defined by @xmath36 , for @xmath37 and @xmath27 .",
    "we just write @xmath28 instead of @xmath35 if there is no confusion .",
    "a word @xmath38 is accepted by a finite automaton if @xmath39 .",
    "two states in a finite automaton @xmath2 are said to be _ equivalent _ if and only if for every word @xmath38 , if @xmath2 is started in either state with @xmath40 as input , it either accepts in both cases or rejects in both cases .",
    "it is well - known that a language which is accepted by an nfa can be accepted by a dfa , and such a language is said to be _ regular_. the language accepted by a dfa @xmath2 is denoted by @xmath41 .",
    "the reader may refer to  @xcite for more details about regular languages and finite automata .",
    "the _ state complexity _ of a regular language @xmath42 , denoted by @xmath43 , is the number of states of the minimal complete dfa that accepts @xmath42 .",
    "the state complexity of a class @xmath44 of regular languages , denoted by @xmath45 , is the supremum among all @xmath43 , @xmath46 .",
    "the state complexity of an operation on regular languages is the state complexity of the resulting languages from the operation as a function of the state complexity of the operand languages .",
    "thus , in a certain sense , the state complexity of an operation is a worst - case complexity .",
    "in this section , we study the state complexity of @xmath47 for an @xmath48-state dfa language @xmath49 and an @xmath50-state dfa language @xmath51 .",
    "we first show that the state complexity of @xmath47 is upper bounded by @xmath5 in general ( theorem  [ l_1^r l_2 upper bound ] ) .",
    "then we prove that this upper bound can be reached when @xmath7 ( theorem  [ l_1^r l_2 lower bound ] ) .",
    "next , we investigate the case when @xmath52 and @xmath53 and prove the state complexity can be lower to @xmath8 in such a case ( theorem  [ l_1^r l_2 state complexity m=1 n>=1 ] ) .",
    "finally , we show that the state complexity of @xmath47 is @xmath9 when @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( theorem  [ l_1^r l_2 state complexity m>=2 n=1 ] ) .",
    "now , we start with a general upper bound of state complexity of @xmath47 for any integers @xmath4 .",
