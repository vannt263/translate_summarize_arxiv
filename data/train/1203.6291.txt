    "it took more than 30 years till efimov s prediction for the existence of weakly bound three - particle states with asymptotic discrete scaling symmetry @xcite was confirmed in the cold - atom physics experiments @xcite . this discovery raised the interest in few - body systems with resonant short - range interactions , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "after the three - body system where semi - analytical results have been obtained as summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite , the next step in the complexity to explore the efimov physics is the system of four identical bosons where several numerical studies @xcite are already available .",
    "although there is no four - boson efimov effect @xcite , the properties of the four - boson system are strongly affected by the three - boson efimov effect .",
    "the observables of the four - boson collisions show the same discrete scaling symmetry and are related to the respective trimer binding energies in a universal way provided the size of the involved few - body bound states greatly exceeds the interaction range @xcite .",
    "furthermore , below each efimov trimer in a certain regime there are two tetramers @xcite .",
    "the tetramers associated with the excited trimers are unstable bound states ( ubs ) @xcite and lead to resonant effects in the four - boson reactions .",
    "first numerical calculations of the four - boson recombination @xcite and dimer - dimer collisions @xcite in the adiabatic hyperspherical representation were followed by the work of refs .",
    "@xcite employing the integral equations for the transition operators that were solved in the momentum - space framework . in the latter case",
    "the universal limits for the scattering observables and tetramer properties such as widths and intersections with thresholds were obtained with considerably higher accuracy ; furthermore , remarkable resonant effects were predicted in the atom - trimer collisions as well @xcite .",
    "the theoretical results @xcite are roughly consistent with the existing data from the dimer - dimer and four - atom recombination experiments @xcite performed in a regime that is not strictly universal .    in the present work we will study a different type of bosonic tetramers , namely , the ones of the approximate dimer - atom - atom structure .",
    "their existence was predicted in refs .",
    "@xcite as a consequence of the three - body efimov effect in the three - body system made off a dimer and two atoms .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ae ] where we schematically show the four - boson energy ( @xmath0 ) spectrum as function of @xmath1 with @xmath2 being the two - boson scattering length .",
    "we consider the regime around the special value @xmath3 that corresponds to the @xmath4th efimov trimer being at the atom - dimer threshold , i.e. , @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the dimer ( @xmath4th trimer ) binding energy relative to the free particle threshold .",
    "if the trimer is a true bound state with zero width , i.e. , if deeper dimers are absent ( which is not the case in typical experiments @xcite ) , the atom - dimer scattering length @xmath8 is infinite at @xmath3 . sufficiently close to @xmath9 and @xmath3 where @xmath8 greatly exceeds the dimer size being of the order of @xmath2 , one may expect to mimic some properties of the few - boson systems using a model that considers the dimer as a pointlike particle .",
    "then in the effective three - body system consisting of a dimer and two atoms there are two atom - dimer pairs with infinite two - body scattering length @xmath8 .",
    "in such a three - body model of the four - boson system the three - body efimov effect occurs , however , with a very large discrete scaling factor @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the resulting efimov states accumulate at @xmath11 .",
    "their dimer - atom - atom structure is only an approximation but no attempt has been made so far to describe them rigorously as four - boson states .",
    "this will be done in the present work using exact four - particle equations .",
    "we label the tetramers of this type by two integers @xmath12 where @xmath4 refers to the associated efimov trimer and @xmath13 distinguishes between different states existing around @xmath3 with fixed @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath12th tetramer intersects the @xmath4th atom - trimer threshold at @xmath14 and the dimer - atom - atom threshold at @xmath15 .",
    "the calculation of these tetramers is technically very difficult task owing their weak binding and very large @xmath16 ; our results will be limited to @xmath17 states .",
    "furthermore , all these tetramers lie above the dimer - dimer threshold and above all lower atom - trimer thresholds @xmath18 with @xmath19 . therefore the considered tetramers are ubs with finite width .",

    "we solve the ags equations in the momentum - space framework using the partial - wave decomposition . in the present study",
    "only the states with zero total angular momentum and positive parity ( @xmath34 ) corresponding to the quantum numbers of the tetramers need to be considered ; among them the states with the nonconserved angular momentum of the three - boson subsystem @xmath35 have to be included for the convergence .",

    "is located in one of the unphysical sheets that is adjacent to the physical sheet @xcite and affects the physical observables leading to resonant effects in the four - boson scattering .",
    "thus , the properties of the unstable tetramers can be extracted from the behavior of @xmath23 as described in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the three - body dimer - atom - atom ( 3bdaa ) model",

    "these calculations need two pair potentials .",
    "the atom - atom potential @xmath40 is the same as in full four - boson calculations .",
    "the atom - dimer potential @xmath41 is taken in the momentum - space representation as @xmath42 .",
    "its strength @xmath43 and momentum cutoff ( inverse range ) parameter @xmath44 for each @xmath2 are adjusted to reproduce @xmath8 , @xmath45 and atom - dimer effective range predicted by the original three - boson calculations using @xmath46 . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath41 yields an accurate description of the low - energy atom - dimer scattering .",
    "we note that the range of @xmath41 with @xmath47 greatly exceeds the range of @xmath46 that is much smaller than @xmath2 .",
    "unless stated otherwise , our results refer to rigorous four - boson calculations .",
    "we present them as dimensionless ratios that are independent of the short - range interaction details in the universal limit . for this one",
    "needs to consider reactions involving highly excited efimov trimers where the finite - range effects become negligible . as shown in previous calculations @xcite",
    ", @xmath48 is sufficient for high accuracy ( note that our nomenclature starts with @xmath49 for the ground state ) .",
    "this is fully consistent with our present results .",
    "for example , for the @xmath50th tetramer intersection with the corresponding atom - trimer threshold we obtain @xmath51 and @xmath52 using one - term form factor in the potential @xmath28 and @xmath53 and @xmath52 using two - term form factor , respectively .",
    "thus , we conclude that for large @xmath4 the universal ratio is @xmath54 corresponding to @xmath55 .",
    "the calculation of the tetramer intersection with the dimer - atom - atom threshold , @xmath56 , turns out to be numerically more complicated and less accurate due to its proximity to @xmath57 .",
    "we have found that @xmath58 .",
    "the higher tetramers @xmath59 may exist only at extremely large atom - dimer scattering length @xmath8 , i.e. , extremely close to @xmath60 , and can not be resolved in our four - boson calculations .",
    "thus , with increasing @xmath61 the ratios @xmath62 @xmath63 very rapidly approach 1 from above ( below ) .",

    "the thin dotted line represents the zero value . ]    the universal values and indicate that the @xmath50th tetramer as ubs exists at @xmath69 .",
    "we show in fig .",

    "we include also the predictions of the 3bdaa model and demonstrate that it is reliable only for the tetramer position at @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "although the 3bdaa model describes well the @xmath4th trimer binding and the low - energy atom - dimer scattering , it does not support lower atom - trimer channels and it is obviously not appropriate in the dimer - dimer channel since the 3bdaa model treats the two dimers asymmetrically .",
    "however , these channels are decisive for the tetramer width since in their absence @xmath74 vanishes .",
    "thus , the failure of the 3bdaa model for @xmath74 is not surprising",
    ". furthermore , the pointlike dimer approximation may only be reasonable when its size , being of order of @xmath2 , becomes negligible as compared to @xmath75 ( that determines also the size of the shallowest trimer if @xmath76 ) , i.e. , for @xmath77 . under this condition",
    "the 3bdaa model may provide a reasonable approximation of the full four - boson model for particular observables like the atom - trimer elastic scattering cross section and the tetramer position @xmath78 , but not for reactions involving the dimer - dimer or lower atom - trimer channels .",
    "the intersection point estimations in eqs .   and",
    "refer to @xmath79 and therefore should be reliable whereas the 3bdaa model fails for @xmath80 as can be seen in in fig .",
    "[ fig : bg ] .",
    "the tetramer lies very close to the atom - trimer threshold , even the largest deviation around @xmath81 is only @xmath82 . for comparison ,",
    "the difference between the atom - trimer and dimer - atom - atom thresholds at this point is @xmath83 .",
    "note that in a narrow interval around @xmath84 the tetramer is slightly above the atom - trimer threshold , i.e. , @xmath85 .",
    "the width @xmath74 vanishes at @xmath84 while at @xmath86 the @xmath50th tetramer becomes an inelastic virtual state ( ivs ) @xcite .",
    "negative width @xmath87 in the ivs case implies the change of the energy sheet .",
    "the ivs corresponds to the pole of the transition operators @xmath23 in the complex energy plane on one of the nonphysical sheets that is , unlike the one of ubs , more distant from the physical sheet @xcite .",
    "the ivs has a visible impact on the physical collision observables only when it is located very near to the scattering threshold @xcite ; an example referring to the four - boson system can be found in ref .",
    "in contrast , the ubs always leads to a resonant behavior .",
    "as example we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : dd ] the @xmath36-wave phase shift @xmath88 and inelasticity parameter @xmath89 for the dimer - dimer and atom - trimer scattering at the total four - boson energy @xmath90 and @xmath81 .",
    "it is interesting to note that only the dimer - dimer phase shift increases by 180 deg while the inelasticity parameter exhibits a rapid variation also for the collisions of atoms and trimers in the @xmath91th efimov state .",
    "thus , in these two cases the inelastic reactions are significantly enhanced by the tetramer ubs whereas a pronounced resonant peak in the elastic cross section is present in the dimer - dimer channel only .",

    "[ fig : a ] as a function of the two - boson scattering length @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath94 exhibits a resonant behavior with @xmath95 having a peak at @xmath84 .",
    "the increase of @xmath93 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : a ] near @xmath96 is not related to the tetramers ; it is due to the scaling of the elastic cross section with the spatial size of the trimer that grows with increasing @xmath8 and decreasing @xmath97 , i.e. , @xmath98 .",
    "this is evident in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : a ] where the ratio @xmath99 exhibits no resonant behavior near @xmath96 .",
    "the inelastic reactions quantified by @xmath100 are not significantly enhanced by the increased size of the trimer .",
    "the failure of the 3bdaa model , especially for @xmath100 and the resonant peak position , can be expected based on fig .",
    "[ fig : bg ] and its discussion .",
    "we show in fig .",

    "however , in a narrow interval around @xmath117 an interesting and unusual situation takes place : the dimer production rate @xmath112 is strongly suppressed and the trimer relaxation process becomes the most important inelastic reaction .",

    "in real experiments the resonance position may deviate from the universal value ( [ eq : at ] ) due to finite - range effects ; however , even without the dimer - trimer intersection , i.e. , without the @xmath122 point in fig .",
    "[ fig : ae ] , the tetramer may still exist as it happens in our model with @xmath123 . on the other hand ,",
