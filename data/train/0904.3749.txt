    "one of the most common problems in astrophysics is the classification of astronomical sources based on their colors and magnitudes in a given photometric system .",
    "when high spectral resolution data ( or a large number of photometric bands covering the source sed ) are available , this classification , and the extraction of the physical parameters of the source , is generally achieved by fitting the observations with an appropriate physical model . in many instances , however , either a reliable model is not available , or the number of photometric bands is not sufficient to provide a robust source classification . when data fitting is not possible , a common fallback solution is to infer the nature of the sources to be classified by their proximity to `` regions '' in meaningful color - color and color - magnitude diagrams , where the sources of a certain class are expected to be found .",
    "these regions are in turn defined on the basis of generic physical considerations ( e.g. stars burning h in their cores are located on the region of the herzsprung - russell diagram we call main sequence ) or by association with other sources of the same class .",
    "a typical example of this approach in the early years of infrared space astronomy were the iras color - color diagrams @xcite aimed to automatically classify the @xmath2 sources found by the infrared astronomical satellite in its bands at 12 , 25 , 60 and 100  .",
    "the diagrams were created by deriving the iras colors of @xmath3 sources whose nature could be inferred by the properties of their iras low resolution spectra @xcite .",
    "the resulting diagrams were a grid of polygonal regions where sources with specific properties ( stars , circumstellar envelopes with varying degrees of optical thickness , planetary nebul and other infrared sources ) were expected to be found . as is common in these cases ,",
    "the boundaries between the regions were defined arbitrarily by using a convenient geometrical pattern bisecting known `` template '' sources used for building the diagrams .",
    "most importantly , these regions did not have an associated statistical meaning , e.g. it was not possible to quantify how complete and effective was the source classification provided by these regions .",
    "other branches of science , however , have developed statistically valid techniques to attack this kind of unstructured classification problems , where detailed knowledge of a model is not required , or not available .",
    "the k - nearest neighbors ( @xmath0-nn ) method @xcite , in particular , has been succesfully used as an efficient `` black box '' predictor for problems of pattern recognition and unsupervised machine learning , in fields ranging from computerized handwriting recognition @xcite to automatic classification of satellite imagery @xcite , to medical imaging and diagnostics .    in astronomy , k - nearest neighbors methods have been traditionally used to study clustering in the spatial distribution of astronomical sources ( see e.g. @xcite ) , by analyzing the statistical distribution of the distances , on the plane of the sky or in the 3-dimensional space , between each source and its nearest neighbors . alternatively , the method has been the base of regression techniques for parameter fitting ( e.g. photometric redshifts , see @xcite ) . in this paper , we will instead apply the @xmath0-nn method in its role of nonparametric classifier , where the class of a new set of data is decided based on its _ distance _ from a class of `` templates '' , and where the distance is defined in a multi - dimensional color and magnitude space .",
    "our implementation of the method is specifically tuned to the search of rare sources hidden in a large catalog .    to illustrate the effectiveness of the method",
    ", we apply our technique to the search of brown dwarfs with the infrared array camera ( irac , @xcite ) onboard the _",
    "space telescope @xcite .",
    "as shown by @xcite , brown dwarfs have unique colors in the near - ir and irac 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0   bands , due to the presence of prominent molecular features such as ch@xmath4 , h@xmath5o , nh@xmath6 and co @xcite in the wavelength range covered by the camera ( see figure  [ fig - spc ] ) .",
    "these colors provide a powerful discriminant to identify brown dwarfs within the large photometric catalogs that have been produced during the _ spitzer _ cryogenic mission .",
    "the @xmath0-nn method is particularly suited for this search , because of its high efficiency in finding `` needles in the haystack '' such as brown dwarfs , among the galactic general population and the extragalactic background .",
    "the method is first applied using data from the _ spitzer _ extragalactic first look survey ( xfls , @xcite ) and the _ spitzer _ shallow survey @xcite , which are combined with ground based optical and near - ir surveys for further refinement of the candidate sample .",
    "the parameter space of the possible color combinations and @xmath0-nn parameters is explored in order to provide and quantify the best possible search completeness and efficiency .",
    "searches using only the two irac bands at 3.6 and 4.5   are also investigated , to assess the possibility of brown dwarf detection using only the two channels that will be available during the post - cryogenic _",
    "warm mission .",
    "section  [ sec - description ] of the paper describes our implementation of the @xmath0-nn method , which is then applied in section  [ sec - bd ] to search for field brown dwarfs in the xfls and shallow surveys . in section  [ sec - nstars ]",
    "the @xmath0-nn method is used to estimate the efficiency and completeness of irac photometric searches of brown dwarf companions around nearby stars . in section  [ sec - concl ]",
    "we summarize the results of these searches , and discuss other possible applications of the method .",
    "in a typical application of the @xmath0-nn method , as described by @xcite , the class of a test element is selected by a majority vote of its @xmath0 nearest templates ( where @xmath0 is optimized to the specific problem at hand ) .",
    "template objects for each class , ( i.e the _ training sample _ ) are distributed in the multi - dimensional space defined by the variables used in the analysis .",
    "the class of the test element is determined by the prevalent class of the @xmath0 templates that , according to a given _ metric _ , are closer to the test element . note",
    "that in this case the choice of the metric is only important for the selection of the @xmath0 nearest templates , after which the decision is determined by the rule adopted to weight the `` votes '' of these @xmath0 nearest templates .",
    "the situation is however different in the classical astronomical setting , where sources of one specific class are searched among a larger set belonging to many other classes , which are generally not specified . in this case , a majority vote is not possible and a different approach is required . in order to address this challenge ,",
    "we have developed a novel implementation of the @xmath0-nn method tuned for the search of rare sources in astronomical photometric catalogs .",
    "our application requires templates only for the `` search class '' , relying on the assumption that the templates are an accurate representation of the class , and that the selection variables ( colors and magnitudes ) chosen in the analysis are sufficient to provide an effective discrimination .",
    "the only quantitative criterion available for the selection , and used to determine its statistical validity , will be the final @xmath0-nn distance of each source in the input catalog , according to the chosen method .",
    "as an example , in section  [ sec - bd ] we show the application of our method to the search of brown dwarfs ( the _ signal _ ) in a catalog where most of the other sources are galaxies or regular stars in different evolutionary stages ( the _ background _ ) .      in any @xmath0-nn application",
    "the choice of the metric is arbitrary , and is ultimately determined only on the basis of its ability to effectively separate the signal from the background .",
    "if the analysis involves @xmath7 separate variables ( in this case colors or absolute magnitudes ) , a common choice is the euclidean distance in the @xmath8-dimensional space , with the individual distances in each variable averaged ( or summed ) on the number of dimensions :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the distance between the source @xmath11 and the template @xmath12 with respect to the variable @xmath13 .",
    "the effect of averaging over the dimensionality @xmath7 is illustrated in figure  [ fig - dist ] : the average increases the size of the ellipse enclosing test sources within a given distance from each template .",
    "if a source has a unitary distance from a template along each variable , the distance will be larger than one in the case of a pure euclidean metric , but still equal to one in the case of averaged euclidean metric .",
    "the latter is preferrable for multi - dimensional spaces where is not desirable to have a metric that tends to become larger as the dimensionality @xmath7 increases : in other words , it is a good choice to have a distance close to unity if the individual components of such distance in each variable are all around unity . for this reason",
    "we have adopted the averaged euclidean distance in this implementation of the @xmath0-nn method .",
    "furtermore , another advantage of averaging is that it allows to weight differently the individual components of the metric , in case some of the variables ( colors or magnitudes ) have a stronger discriminatory property for the problem at hand .",
    "however , in the applications presented here we assume for simplicity that all the variables are equally important , and no weighting is necessary .    to ensure that the distances along each variable play an equal role in the final metric , a normalization is required .",
    "the metric should take into account , for example , if one color or magnitude has larger uncertainty than the others .",
    "thus we divide each distance by its associated total uncertainty :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the statistical uncertainties of the data and templates respectively ( e.g. their 3@xmath17 photometric error ) in the variable @xmath13 , and where @xmath18 is a measure of the non - gaussian systematic errors of the template @xmath12 ( explained below ) , also in the variable @xmath13 .",
    "the final @xmath0-nn distance of a source @xmath11 is then the ( weighted ) average of the distances to the nearest @xmath0 templates ( the optimal number of neighbors @xmath0 is determined with the techniques described in section  [ ssec - apply ] ) :    @xmath19    the weights @xmath20 are introduced to reduce the influence of isolated templates that happen to be much farther away than the other nearest neighbors .",
    "a gaussian kernel is very effective for this task :    @xmath21 ^ 2\\ ] ]    note that the gaussian kernel is parametrized with the geometric average ( on all variables @xmath13 ) of the same normalization factor @xmath22 adopted for the individual distances .",
    "this is again necessary to scale the range of the kernel proportionally to the accuracy of the individual templates .",
    "the extra factor @xmath0 plays the role of reducing the effectiveness of the kernel as the number of neighbors increases , which is the intended goal of using a large value for @xmath0 .",
    "the effect of this normalization on the @xmath0-nn distance is shown in figure  [ fig - norm ] .",
    "the contours traced around the template sources enclose the areas within a given @xmath0-nn distance from the training sample .",
    "the meaning of this region becomes obvious in the case of @xmath23 ( solid line ) .",
    "thanks to the normalization with the total uncertainty @xmath22 , the region with a radius @xmath24 is nothing else than the union of the error ellipses around the templates . a test source within the region",
    "will have a separation from the template class which is less than the uncertainty in the data and the templates , and will thus likely be a member of the template class . a source with @xmath25",
    "will instead have a greater probability of not being a member , and should be rejected .",
    "note that for @xmath26 the border of the region closely follows the location of the templates , deviating from a smooth line because of the scatter in the distribution of the training sample",
    ". a larger value of @xmath0 , on the other end , will average on the position of the individual templates , thus producing a smoother contour , albeit at the risk of excluding isolated templates from the region .",
    "the best value of @xmath0 will be a compromise between these two different tendencies , and needs to be determined case by case , with the parameter optimization techniques explained in the following section .",
    "the solid line in figure  [ fig - norm ] was derived without adding the non - gaussian systematic error @xmath18 in the templates . as a result , for any given @xmath0-nn distance",
    ", the size of the region is determined only by the statistical errors in data and templates . a direct consequence of this",
    ", however , is that templates that are separated by a distance larger than their statistical error will produce separated regions .",
    "this is not desiderable , as in most astronomical applications the location of the templates is only partially in control of the astronomer . due to low statistics it depends on the chance location , in the color - color and color - magnitude space , of the template sources that have been possible to observe .",
    "this is particularly true for the search of rare sources , where only a small number of templates is generally available .",
    "the sparseness of the templates in this case may lead to a serious problem , as regions of the color - magnitude space where sources of the template class may exist could be excluded only because no templates have been observed there at the time the training sample was assembled . to correct this issue",
    "we introduce in our @xmath0-nn metric the _ sparseness factor _",
    "@xmath18 , which is a measure of how far apart the templates are with respect to each variable @xmath13 :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is defined as the average distance of the template @xmath12 from the remaining @xmath0 nearest templates . the dotted line ( for @xmath26 ) in figure  [ fig - norm ]",
    "shows how the introduction of the sparseness factor @xmath18 , acknowledging the inadequacy of the template distribution in a region of the parameter space , is able to reconnect the region despite the lack of templates between the two sets that are separated in the solid line region .",
    "particular caution , however , should be taken while introducing the @xmath28 defined as in equation  [ eq - sparse ] in cases where a gap in the templates distribution is actually expected in the data ( e.g. the gap in the horizontal branch for he burning giants in the herzsprung - russell diagram ) . in such cases , the presence of the gap can only be noticed , and is statistically significant , when it is sampled by a large number of templates on both sides of the gap .",
    "if @xmath0 is chosen to be much smaller than the number of templates in the gap region , the gap will still be preserved as no template across the gap will be among the @xmath0 nearest neighbors in equation  [ eq - sparse ] , and the sparseness factor will be smaller than the width of the gap .      the @xmath0-nn metric we have defined in eq .",
    "[ eq - knn ] is ideally suited for selecting rare astronomical sources based on their spectral properties from a large photometric catalog .",
    "the first step in applying the method is the identification of the variables to use .",
    "these variables can be any combination of colors or magnitudes . unless the number of available bands is so small that all the possible combinations can be tested ,",
    "the best course of action is to choose the variables that , based on astrophysical considerations , provide the best discrimination ( e.g. colors sensitive to peculiar spectral features ) .",
    "caution must be used to avoid choosing too many variables : even though one would naively assume that more variables would produce a better selection , this is not always the case and can lead to the so - called `` curse of dimensionality '' ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "also variables that do not carry a significant discriminating role should be avoided , because they would dilute the effectiveness of the metric by averaging out more effective variables .",
    "having multiple variables sensitive to the same physical property can also be counter - productive , as it biases the metric towards this one physical characteristic , at the expense of other equally or more important discriminants .",
    "a solution to this issue is to either to avoid adding variables not contributing any original discriminant , or to reduce their influence by fine - tuning the @xmath0-nn metric with appropriate weights .",
    "once the variables are chosen , the @xmath29 distance of each source in the catalog can be determined .",
    "the selection is done by comparing @xmath29 with a threshold value @xmath1 above which the sources are rejected . for maximum effectiveness the number of neighbors @xmath0 and the threshold distance @xmath1 have to be optimized for the problem at hand .",
    "the goal of this optimization is to select the smallest possible number of candidates to follow - up , while preserving the completeness of the search . in this context",
    ", we define the _ completeness _ @xmath30 as the fraction of the objects that are found , with respect to their expected number . in addition , we define the _ rejection efficiency _ @xmath31 as the fraction of the background objects that are successfully rejected .",
    "an ideal search will have 100% completeness ( all sources are found ) and 100% rejection efficiency ( all the returned candidates are genuine ) . in practice both fractions will be lower than 1 , and the search parameters should be optimized to provide maximum possible rejection efficiency and completeness .",
    "this optimization can be done using either the _ jackknife _ or the _ bootstrap _ methods @xcite . both methods attempt to estimate the statistical distribution of @xmath32 and @xmath33 to determine the best values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the jackknife method tests the minimum distance for which the templates are an homogeneous and contiguous set .",
    "given a certain @xmath0 , one measures the @xmath0-nn distance of each template from the remaining @xmath34 ( leave - one - out method ) .",
    "once this is done for all templates , the completeness is derived as the fraction of templates that are within any given threshold distance @xmath1 . while this method is relatively straightforward , it may be very inaccurate for the search of rare sources , since the number of available templates is often small and does not cover uniformly the color and magnitude distribution of the target objects .",
    "thus we adopt the bootstrap method .    with the bootstrap method we evaluate the completeness by creating an artificial sample with the characteristics of the templates .",
    "this artificial sample is then tested with the @xmath0-nn method to estimate how many of these simulated sources are found within a distance @xmath1 .",
    "the test sample is generated by varying the template colors and magnitudes , adding a random offset using the statistical and systematic errors in the templates .",
    "the statistical errors are introduced by adding a gaussian error equal to the statistical uncertainty of the templates ( @xmath16 in equation  [ eq - norm ] ) .",
    "the systematic errors are instead simulated by adding a random uniform component equal to the amplitude of the template sparseness factor @xmath18 defined in equation  [ eq - sparse ] . with this method",
    "it is possible to create an arbitrary number of simulated signal and background samples of any size , enabling the study of the statistical distribution of @xmath35 even when only a small number of templates is available .    the rejection efficiency @xmath31 is similarly evaluated with the bootstrap method .",
    "if a `` pure '' background sample can be extracted from the catalog , then it is just a matter of counting the fraction of catalog sources that are rejected with any combination of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in most cases a pure background sample",
    "is however not available but , if the objects in the search class are rare , any small sub - sample of the full catalog can be assumed to have a very small contamination of template - class sources .",
    "these sub - samples can be randomized introducing gaussian noise equal to the data uncertainty @xmath15 defined in equation  [ eq - norm ] .",
    "sub - samples that by chance have a larger level of contamination will appear as outliers , and can be removed from the final distribution of @xmath36 .",
    "once the distribution of @xmath30 and @xmath31 is known , the characteristics of the selection problem determine the value of @xmath0 and @xmath1 to choose .",
    "if the search needs to be very selective because a large number of follow - up observations is not affordable , then the completeness can be sacrificed ( generally by using a small value of @xmath1 ) in favor of high @xmath31 . on the contrary ,",
    "when completeness is paramount , a larger threshold distance can be adopted even though it will result in a large number of candidates . as an intermediate solution",
    "we adopt the value of @xmath1 and @xmath0 for which @xmath37 is the highest .",
    "after the @xmath0-nn metric is applied with the optimized parameters , all sources within the threshold distance @xmath1 should be considered as candidates .",
    "these candidate sources can be followed - up by applying further selection criteria ( e.g. applying color cuts that could not be included in the @xmath0-nn metric , or by executing new targeted observations ) .",
    "if the selected sample is still too big for a follow - up program , it can be helpful to run the @xmath0-nn method a second time on the first - run selection , using a different set of variables .",
    "this is particularly effective if there is a concern that some variables have yielded a lower selection efficiency than expected , due to having been averaged out in the metric by other variables . in this case",
    "it may be just more efficient to re - apply the @xmath0-nn method using only these variables , starting from the sources selected in the first run , rather than trying to improve the efficiency of the first @xmath0-nn run by fine tuning the weights between the variables .",
    "as an application of the method , we present the search of brown dwarfs in _ spitzer _ surveys .",
    "brown dwarfs represent the link between main sequence stars , fully supported by h burning in their cores , and planets . given our poor understanding of the lower end in the stellar mass distribution , an accurate census of the galactic population of brown dwarfs is of paramount importance to constrain models of star formation and galactic evolution , and to provide an accurate measurement of the stellar mass in the galaxy .",
    "due to their low luminosity and red colors , brown dwarfs are difficult to find . the first unambiguous identification of a brown dwarf , gliese 229b @xcite , came only 20 years after the class was introduced by jill tarter in her ph.d . thesis . in recent years , however , the availability of deep wide area surveys such as the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass , @xcite ) , the deep near infrared survey of the southern sky ( denis , @xcite ) , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) and the ukirt ( uk infrared telescope ) infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss , @xcite ) allowed to identify an increasing number of brown dwarfs in the solar neighborhood ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the total number of brown dwarfs known to date ( @xmath38 of the red , dusty l dwarfs , and @xmath39 of the cooler , methane rich t dwarfs , according to the dwarfarchives.org database ) is still too small to provide a reliable characterization of the substellar mass function .    the sensitivity of the irac instrument onboard _ spitzer _ , and the characteristics of its photometric system , raised expectations for a large increase in the number of brown dwarfs ( especially the cooler t dwarfs ) detected using wide area _ spitzer",
    "_ surveys .",
    "these expectations , however , have not yet materialized .",
    "only three t dwarfs have been discovered by _ spitzer _ : a t4.5 field dwarf in the extragalactic _ spitzer _",
    "shallow survey @xcite , and two t dwarf companions around the nearby young stars hn  peg and hd  3651 @xcite .",
    "this state of affairs arises from the complexity of discriminating brown dwarf candidates from the large number of extragalactic red sources that are within the detection limits of irac observations .",
    "the success of photometric searches ultimately depends on the efficiency of the selection method required to extract from these large catalogs a manageable sample of sources for spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "this selection is usually done by applying cuts in the color and magnitude space ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite , in particular , used a single irac color cut , @xmath40 - [ 4.5 ] \\geq 0.4 $ ] , to select t dwarfs with deep ch@xmath4 absorption in the 3.6   irac band , complemented by criteria based on the photometry and the morphology of the sources in optical bands .",
    "these criteria are not able to discriminate between brown dwarfs and high redshit quasars , and are limited to the detection of dwarfs of spectral type t3 to t6 .",
    "the @xmath0-nn method proposed here has been designed to analyze datasets in a multi - dimensional color and magnitude space , based only on the distribution of templates without the need to define a - priori cuts .",
    "thus it is in principle capable to go beyond these limitations , opening the search to l and early - t dwarfs and t dwarfs of type later than t6 , without introducing the biases associated with the choice of the cuts , and provide a more efficient and complete search .",
    "this will be especially important during the _ spitzer _ warm mission planned from the spring of 2009 when , upon exhaustion of the cryogenic lhe , the observatory will be tasked to conduct large area surveys using only the irac bands at 3.6 and 4.5  @xcite .",
    "in this section we study how to improve on the selection efficiency of _ spitzer_/irac search of brown dwarfs using the @xmath0-nn method .",
    "we explore the @xmath0-nn parameter space to understand the best strategy for these searches , and what are the requirements , in terms of auxiliary data , for their success .",
    "we also develop techniques that allow to assess the completeness of the result , necessary to draw statistically valid conclusions from these searches .      as test datasets to illustrate our @xmath0-nn search for brown dwarfs , we use two publicly available _",
    "spitzer_/irac wide field surveys : the xfls @xcite and the botes field of the irac shallow survey @xcite .",
    "the xfls main field covers an area of 3.8  deg@xmath41 at high galactic latitude , observed to a sensitivity reaching a @xmath42 vega magnitude of 18.9 , 18.0 , 15.7 and 15.1 at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0   respectively ( obtained with integration times of at least 60  sec per pointing ) .",
    "the xfls main field was chosen for the availability of extensive auxiliary data , including sdss and 2mass .",
    "the botes field of the shallow survey instead covers an area of 8  deg@xmath41 with limiting @xmath42 vega magnitudes of 18.4 , 17.7 , 15.5 and 14.8 at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0   respectively ( integration time @xmath43  sec ) .",

    "the main difference between the two samples ( apart for the shallow survey being almost twice the area of the xfls ) , is in the depth of the optical and near - ir ancillary data . while sdss provides @xmath42 detection limits of 22.3 , 23.3 , 23.1",

    "the added depth of the ndwfs and flamex data provides a powerful tool to resolve ambiguities between red sources in the irac bands of galactic and extragalactic nature . by testing our method on both datasets we can measure the efficiency of the brown dwarf search on surveys with different depth and assess the auxiliary data requirements necessary to enable effective brown dwarf searches during the _ spitzer _ warm mission .",
    "figure  [ fig - fls ] shows the distribution of point sources from the xfls in a number of irac and 2mass colors , compared with the distribution of 37 l , 7 early - t ( t@xmath554.5 ) and 22 late - t ( t@xmath564.5 ) templates from @xcite .",
    "we chose the colors in the diagrams to maximize the separation between brown dwarfs and other galactic ( clump near zero colors ) and extragalactic ( long plume with red colors ) sources .",
    "in particular ( see figure  [ fig - spc ] ) : ( 1 ) the @xmath57 $ ] color is effective in separating the l dwarfs from regular stars , mainly due to h@xmath5o absorption in the @xmath44 band ; ( 2 ) the @xmath58 $ ] and @xmath40-[4.5]$ ] colors separate the t dwarfs from all other sources ( l dwarfs , regular stars and extragalactic objects ) , due to the increasing ch@xmath4 absorption in the @xmath59 and 3.6   bands ; ( 3 ) the @xmath60-[5.8]$ ] color is useful to select again the t dwarfs , which appear blue because of h@xmath5o absorption in the 5.8   band ; and ( 4 ) the @xmath40-[8.0]$ ] color is also providing a strong separation of the t dwarfs due to the methane absorption which is stronger at shorter wavelength than in the reddest irac band .",
    "color combinations using the @xmath54 band have a similar discriminatory power than colors with the @xmath44 and @xmath45 photometry : @xmath61 $ ] shows a trend analogous to the @xmath57 $ ] color , and @xmath62 $ ] has a very similar color trend than @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "the @xmath63 colors provide a similar discrimination than the @xmath40-[4.5]$ ] colors , because of ch@xmath4 absorption stronger in the @xmath45 than the @xmath44 band .",
    "the late - t dwarfs appear well separated from any other source , thanks especially to the @xmath40-[4.5]$ ] irac color , even though some contamination persists with red high - redshift quasars having pah emission .",
    "the early - t and l dwarfs are however more difficult to discriminate because , once dispersion due to photometric errors is taken into account , their color space is very similar to the one occupied by low - redshift galaxies and regular stars .",
    "for this reason , and due to the relative small number of early - t dwarfs in the @xcite sample , our @xmath0-nn selection is done for two separate classes only : one comprising all l and early - t templates , and one with late - t ( with t@xmath564.5 ) dwarfs .    to explore the effect of the presence or absence of individual bands in the selection efficiency , we have divided our xfls and shallow survey catalogs in 2 different subsamples : ( 1 ) sources having @xmath64 photometry in @xmath44 , @xmath45 and all four irac bands ; ( 2 ) sources having @xmath64 detection in @xmath44 , @xmath45 , 3.6 and 4.5  .",
    "the first sample is intended to test the effectiveness of the @xmath0-nn method when all ir bands are available ( the @xmath54 band has not been considered because of its unavailability in flamex , and because brown dwarf colors using the @xmath54 band are very similar to the colors using @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) . the second sample is instead designed to simulate the case of the _ spitzer _ warm mission , when only the two short wavelength irac channels will be available , and also to avoid the limitations imposed by the less sensitive 5.8 and 8.0   bands in currently available surveys . for each sample",
    "the search is done using a subset of the available colors , avoiding the repetition of similar colors , that would dilute the @xmath0-nn metric .",
    "the characteristic of the individual subsamples , their size and the color combinations used in the @xmath0-nn search are listed in table  [ tab - samples ] .",
    "optical photometry and imaging are not used at this stage , because only a limited number of the brown dwarfs we are using as templates have reliable magnitudes at optical wavelengths .",
    "the optical data will however be crucial to refine the search results later on .",
    "the best values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the search can be determined by using the bootstrap method described in section  [ ssec - apply ] .",
    "the goal is to optimize the @xmath0-nn parameters in order to have the smallest possible number of candidates that will need follow - up observations while preserving the completeness of the search .",
    "the jackknife method is not suitable in this case because of the very small number of available templates in each brown dwarf class .",
    "the completeness of the search in this case is @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the number of brown dwarfs expected to exist in the dataset and @xmath67 is the number of false negatives ( i.e. true brown dwarfs not identified ) in the search .",
    "the rejection efficiency can be written as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the fraction of false positives , i.e. the number @xmath70 of incorrectly identified brown dwarfs , with respect to the total number of sources @xmath71 in the sample .    figure  [ fig - opt ] shows the rejection efficiency and completeness for a monte carlo test using 100 randomized samples each with 500 background sources and 500 simulated brown dwarfs , for @xmath72 , 5 and 7 .",
    "the simulations are made for the subsample using irac plus @xmath44 and @xmath45 bands ( for both l / early - t and late - t searches ) , and for _ spitzer _ warm mission colors ( as described in table  [ tab - samples ] ) .",
    "the figure shows the resulting rejection efficiency and completeness for the xfls ; similar results are obtained for the shallow survey .    the rejection efficiency curve is a decreasing function of @xmath1 because when sources with larger @xmath0-nn distances are selected it is more likely to include false positives in the candidates . on the other hand , for smaller @xmath1",
    "more true brown dwarfs are missed , leading to a smaller completeness .",
    "we have adopted the @xmath1 for which the two curves cross .",
    "the values of @xmath1 at the @xmath31 and @xmath30 crossing point for @xmath73 , 5 and 7 are listed in table  [ tab - ec ] for simulations of the xfls and shallow survey search subsamples .",
    "note that @xmath1 tends to be smaller for l / early - t than for late - t searches .",
    "this is because ( as shown in figure  [ fig - opt ] ) the efficiency @xmath31 of l / early - t searches drops faster with @xmath1 than in late - t searches , due to the irac colors of l / early - t dwarfs being relatively similar to the colors of regular late spectral type stars and low redshift galaxies ( see figure  [ fig - fls ] ) : in l / early - t searches even a small increase in @xmath1 results in a large contamination of background sources and thus in a fast drop of the efficiency @xmath31 . as a result , in l / early - t searches the crossing point @xmath74 occurs for smaller values of @xmath1 than in late - t searches where , thanks to the unique colors of late - t dwarfs , the efficiency drops slowly as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "table  [ tab - ec ] shows that the search of late - t dwarfs using irac and near - ir colors combined reaches high level of completeness and rejection efficiency , up to 99.9% . even if only the two short wavelength irac bands are used ( as will be the case in the warm mission ) , @xmath31 and @xmath30 are still similarly high .",
    "note however that the completeness and rejection efficiency of the warm mission search tend to be smaller when irac photometry is combined with the deeper flamex dataset , rather then the shallower 2mass , due to the higher number of red extragalactic sources cross - correlated with the irac catalog .",
    "the l / early - t search is less efficient than the late - t search , with @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xmath75% , due to the higher contamination of this sample with background sources with similar colors .",
    "rejection efficiency and completeness are generally higher for small @xmath0 , because in that case the selection region follows more closely the distribution of the templates . using small @xmath0",
    ", however , puts us at risk of depending critically on outliers in the template class .",
    "we adopted @xmath76 for the searches done using all irac bands . for the search in `` warm mission '' condition , however , we adopted @xmath72 to have the maximum possible efficiency , given the larger size of the initial catalog .",
    "the results of the @xmath0-nn search for brown dwarfs are presented in table  [ tab - knn - sel ] .",
    "the table shows , for each subsample of the xfls and shallow survey , the number @xmath77 of selected sources .",
    "the actual rejection efficiency @xmath78 ( where @xmath79 is the number of sources in each subsample ) is also shown . comparison with table  [ tab - ec ] shows that @xmath80 is very similar to the rejection efficiency @xmath81 predicted by the bootstrap method monte carlo simulations .",
    "table  [ tab - knn - sel ] shows that , when all irac bands are available , the @xmath0-nn method alone is efficient enough to reduce the number of possible candidates to a size small enough to allow visual inspection of the candidates . as only the @xmath0-nn method",
    "is used , the selected candidates are not biased by the choice of arbitrary cuts , depending only on a metric with known completeness , normalized on the statistical uncertainties of both data and templates .",
    "optical data are however available , and can be used to further reduce the candidate sample , which is still necessary in the case of l / early - t dwarf searches , and when requiring only 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath82 m photometry ( resulting in a much larger catalog ) .",
    "the low temperature of brown dwarfs requires their optical colors to be very red , in contrast with the case of extragalactic objects that tends to have a flatter optical sed .",
    "in particular , according to @xcite , l dwarfs have @xmath83 in the sdss photometric system , while t dwarfs have @xmath84 . according to @xcite l and early - t dwarfs",
    "have @xmath85 while according to @xcite late - t dwarfs must have @xmath86 in the ndwfs bands .",
    "these criteria can be applied to all selected sources , as long as their @xmath49 and @xmath50 magnitudes ( for sources in the sdss ) or @xmath52 and @xmath53 magnitudes ( for ndwfs sources ) are known .",
    "sources missing optical photometry can still be considered as brown dwarf candidates , given that their absence from the optical catalog may be an indication of very red colors .",
    "these colors can not be introduced directly in the @xmath0-nn metric because good photometry in the optical bands is missing for a significant fraction of our templates . by using the optical bands in the form of `` cuts '' we are introducing a bias associated to the choice of the cut .",
    "however this is still more efficient that doing the selection using cuts alone , since the candidates have been pre - selected in an unbiased mode using all the other bands with the @xmath0-nn metric .",
    "this allows us to adopt a less stringent optical color criteria while still preserving very high efficiency in the selection .",
    "it also allows to retain the candidates selected with the @xmath0-nn method that are missing optical data ( the potentially coolest late - t candidates ) , which would be eliminated by default if color cuts were the only selection criteria .",
    "the application of the criteria described above reduces drastically the number of viable candidates .",
    "the remaining candidates can then be checked visually from the sdss and ndwfs plates , to eliminate all sources that appear extended , that are blended with other sources , or that are corrupted by artifacts in the images .",
    "the remaining candidates are listed in table  [ tab - xfls ] and [ tab - flamex ] .",
    "the number of viable candidates after the optical criteria are applied is listed in table  [ tab - knn - sel ] , separately for the @xmath87 sources that possess optical detection , and the @xmath88 that are not detected in the optical surveys .",
    "note that when all irac , @xmath44 and @xmath45 photometry is known , cross - checking with optical data reduces the number of late - t dwarf candidates to zero for the xfls , and to only one for the shallow survey .",
    "the lone t dwarf selected for the shallow survey is in fact the t4.5 dwarf irac j142950.8@xmath89333011 found by @xcite in their search .",
    "this result shows that the @xmath0-nn method , when used on near - ir and _ spitzer _ data , in combination with deep optical photometry is capable to select true late - t dwarfs while rejecting all other sources of different nature .",
    "in fact , the method here described effectively rejected the second red source found by @xcite color cuts , the @xmath90 radio - loud quasar irac j142738.5@xmath89331242 .",
    "figure  [ fig - sel-7b ] shows the @xmath91 $ ] and @xmath40 - [ 4.5]$ ] colors of all the candidates selected in both surveys . of the plotted sources , 5 have colors at odd with the brown dwarf templates .",
    "these sources , most likely red background galaxies , have identical colors than t dwarfs in all bands , with the exception of the two plotted here .",
    "the fact that they have been selected by the @xmath0-nn method is an example of `` variable dilution '' in the metric , as described in section  [ ssec - apply ] . to refine the selection",
    "we can apply a second time the @xmath0-nn method , using only this pair of variables , the @xmath92 $ ] and @xmath40 -[4.5]$ ] colors .",
    "the region corresponding to @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( providing completeness @xmath95% in these two variables ) is plotted in figure  [ fig - sel-7b ] , and confirms that these sources are outliers .",
    "we flagged them as such in table  [ tab - flamex ] .",
    "after these anomalies are taken into account , we are left with 1 viable l / early - t and no viable late - t candidates in the xfls ( table  [ tab - xfls ] ) , and 3 viable l / early - t candidates and 1 late - t dwarf ( the t4.5 dwarf j142950.5@xmath89333011 ) in the shallow survey ( table  [ tab - flamex ] ) .",
    "the l / early - t viable candidates need follow - up observations ( currently in progress ) to determine unambiguously their nature .",
    "as a second example illustrating the case of @xmath0-nn metric using not only colors but also absolute magnitudes , we show the case of the search of low mass companions around nearby stars .",
    "this search was conducted as part of the irac guaranteed time observations ( p.i .",
    "giovanni fazio ) programs pid  33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , and 48 @xcite .",
    "the survey focused on 400 stars within 30  pc from the sun , among which all stars and brown dwarfs within 5  pc known to date .",
    "the sample included young stars with age @xmath96  myr , stars with known radial velocity discovered exoplanets , and the l and t dwarfs from @xcite used here as templates .",
    "each star was imaged to a depth of of @xmath97  sec in all irac bands , with a field of view of @xmath98  arcmin , sufficient to detect companions at a distance of @xmath99 to 4,000  au from the primary , to a limiting mass of @xmath10020  m@xmath101 .",
    "the search has yielded the discovery of two new t dwarfs from the whole sample , presented in @xcite .",
    "all the observations were made in a single epoch , preventing the search of companions by virtue of their common proper motion with the primary ( except for the few cases in which a deep near - ir image was available ) .",
    "the candidate selection was instead based on the @xmath0-nn method described below . while a paper analyzing the search results is in preparation ( carson et al . , 2009 ) , we want here to discuss the efficiency of the @xmath0-nn method in this particular case of brown dwarf search .",
    "figure  [ fig - mag - ns ] shows simulated @xmath60 $ ] vs. @xmath40-[4.5]$ ] photometry of l , early - t and late - t dwarfs around a nearby star at 5 , 10 and 20  pc . to simulate the photometry of background sources around the primary star",
    ", we have used the xfls catalog , which is an adequate representation of a background field projected at high galactic latitude . for nearby stars projected closer to the plane of the galaxy",
    ", the proportion of extragalactic / galactic sources will be smaller , reducing the contamination from red extragalactic sources , while contamination from red galactic sources is likely to be increased .",
    "the latter ( mass losing evolved stars and young stellar objects ) may however be discriminated by means of auxiliary infrared observations capable of detecting the thermal emission from their circumstellar dust .",
    "figure  [ fig - mag - ns ] also shows @xmath0-nn regions plotted for @xmath76 and @xmath102 . by adding the @xmath60 $ ] magnitude to the @xmath0-nn",
    "variables the selection is in principle improved because a large fraction of the red background extragalactic sources are fainter than the expected brightness of brown dwarf companions .",
    "this is especially true for t dwarfs around stars within 510  pc from the sun .",
    "this advantage is reduced for searches around farther stars , since the brightness of t dwarf companions at @xmath103  pc is the same of the extragalactic background .",
    "we have estimated the rejection efficiency and completeness of this search using the same bootstrap method described in section  [ ssec - apply ] .",
    "table  [ tab - ec - ns ] shows that for early - t dwarfs the selection efficiency reaches very high values ( up to 99% for primaries at 5  pc ) . for",
    "late - t dwarfs the rejection efficiency is approximately the same that is obtained by using only colors as selection criteria , and the inclusion of absolute magnitudes does not result in a dramatic improvement in the search effectiveness ( suggesting that the @xmath0-nn color selection is already close to maximum efficiency ) .",
    "the @xmath31 and @xmath30 obtained in the simulations , are adequate for this kind of search : the typical number of sources in the @xmath104 stars part of the irac companion search program had an average of @xmath105 background sources each . with this efficiency , for each field",
    "the chosen @xmath0-nn criteria selected up to 3 candidates , many of them actually present in at least one 2mass map , and could be ruled out either by the absence of proper motion , or because they did not possess the correct near - ir colors .",
    "the few remaining candidates were followed - up spectroscopically and by acquiring deep near - ir images , resulting in the two new t dwarfs found around hn  peg and hd  3651 , presented in @xcite .",
    "based on the photometry given by @xcite , the sensitivity of the xfls and the shallow survey in the irac bands allows for the detection of late - t dwarfs ( t4 to t8 spectral type ) up to a distance of @xmath106  pc .",
    "this limit is determined mainly by the lower sensitivity of the 5.8 and 8.0   bands , for the latest spectral types .",
    "if only the 3.6 and 4.5   bands are used , as in the _ spitzer _ warm mission , the higher sensitivity allows detection of late - t dwarfs up to a distance of @xmath99  pc .",
    "the detection limit at the l - t boundary is @xmath107  pc ( @xmath108  pc if only the 3.6 and 4.5   bands are required ) . within this volume ( corrected for the malmquist bias )",
    ", we can expect a brown dwarf search to be as complete as @xmath109% , as estimated in section  [ ssec - optimization ] ( multiplied by the completeness of the original survey , and corrected for binarity ) .",
    "searches using 2mass photometry , however , will have more stringent limits , of @xmath110  pc for late - t dwarfs and @xmath111  pc at the l - t boundary .",
    "the sensitivity of the flamex survey is such that any l or t dwarf detected in the irac 3.6 and 4.5   bands will also be detected in the @xmath44 band , even though the lower sensitivity of the @xmath59 band limits the maximum detection distance for a t8 dwarf to @xmath112  pc .",
    "the very small number of brown dwarf candidates that are not optically detected in at least the @xmath53 band shows that the depth of the ndwfs is not a significant constraint in the search of brown dwarfs .",
    "the main limitation rather comes from the depth of the irac data .",
    "these considerations come into play to understand the potential for brown dwarf searches in the recently approved exploration science surveys in the _ spitzer _ warm mission .",
    "the requirements for brown dwarf detection are clearly a large survey area , deep observations and the availability of matching near - ir and possibly optical data . of the approved warm mission programs , three",
    "satisfy these requirements : the `` _ spitzer _ extragalactic representative volume survey ( servs ) '' ( pi mark lacy , pid 60024 ) , the `` _ spitzer _ extended deep survey ( seds ) '' ( pi giovanni fazio , pid 60022 ) and the `` glimpse360 : completing the _ spitzer _ galactic plane survey '' ( pi barbara whitney , pid 60020 ) .",
    "our analysis shows that when near - ir data of sufficient depth are available ( as in the case of the flamex survey ) , the search for late - t dwarfs using the photometric @xmath0-nn technique described in section  [ sec - bd ] is extremely efficient and complete ( more than 99.8% @xmath31 and @xmath30 ) .",
    "once a single @xmath113 or @xmath114 optical color is applied , the final selection produces a very small number of viable candidates to be checked individually ( 4 l / early - t and 1 late - t viable candidates ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the only late - t dwarf candidate selected in our search is indeed a t4.5 dwarf , as discovered by @xcite . with @xmath115% completeness",
    "we can assert that this is the only late - t dwarf present in the volume of the survey ( 7.1  deg@xmath41 for the flamex field with a depth of @xmath116  pc ) , even when only the two short wavelength irac bands are considered .",
    "this number is consistent with the results from the t dwarf ukidss dr2 large area survey @xcite , that estimates @xmath117 late - t dwarfs in an area of 280  deg@xmath41 for a depth of @xmath118 ( corresponding to a maximum distance of @xmath119  pc for t8 dwarfs ) . by factorizing the search volume between the two surveys , where @xmath120",

    "these numbers can be used to estimate the potential yield of brown dwarfs in the approved warm _",
    "exploration science surveys",
    ". the most promising _",
    "warm mission project for the application of the @xmath0-nn method here described is the servs survey . with a total area of 18  deg@xmath41 , and a total exposure time of 600  sec per pointing",
    ", it will probe a brown dwarf volume almost 9 times larger than the irac shallow survey ( search depth of @xmath126  pc for late - t dwarfs scales as the limiting flux @xmath127 , in turn scaling as the signal - to - noise ratio s / n @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the exposure time .",
    "this gives @xmath130 and thus @xmath131 ) .",
    "a large fraction of the survey will overlap with the video vista survey , providing a depth of 25.7 , 24.6 , 24.5 , 24.0 and 23.5  mags in the @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath44 , @xmath54 and @xmath59 bands , more than matching the depth of servs in the irac 3.6 and 4.5   bands . based on these sensitivity",
    ", servs may find as many as @xmath134 late - t dwarfs and a large number of l and early - t dwarfs .",
    "the seds program , on the other hand , has a much smaller survey area ( @xmath135  deg@xmath41 ) but a much longer integration time ( 12  hours per pointing ) .",
    "this scales down to a searchable volume of @xmath136 times the total volume of the shallow survey ( search depth of @xmath137  pc for late - t dwarfs ) .",
    "this survey can potentially provide as many as @xmath138 late - t dwarfs , even though a decrease in the brown dwarf density should be expected as the survey probes farther distances from the galactic mid - plane .",
    "this survey , however , may be limited by the challenge of finding ancillary optical and near - ir data matching the depth of the irac photometry .",
    "while this may limit the effective late - t dwarf searchable volume , the potential search depth offered by the irac data , in a high galactic latitude region , will provide an important test for the vertical distribution of the brown dwarf population in the galaxy .",
    "the glimpse360 survey , instead , compensates the rather shallow coverage ( 36  sec integration time for each pointing ) with a very large survey area ( 187  deg@xmath41 ) . a substantial portion of this area",
    "is also covered by the ukidss survey @xcite , implying that @xmath139 of the 17 late - t dwarfs estimated for the whole ukidss may be present in the glimpse360 area . according to the glimpse360 consortium , more detailed simulations by @xcite predict 70  t0 , @xmath105  t5 and @xmath14020  t8 dwarfs in the survey search area . the challenge will be to isolate these brown dwarfs from the high - confusion galactic field , and distinguish them from other red galactic sources",
    ". the @xmath0-nn method can play an important role for this task .",
    "the main advantage of the @xmath0-nn method presented in this paper is that it allows to perform photometric searches using a large number of color and magnitude variables , defining complex regions that closely follow the distribution of the sources to be selected .",
    "while similar regions can be defined manually , our method prevents the introduction of biases in the selection due to the choice of the cuts . with the @xmath0-nn method the selection regions in the color / magnitude space",
    "are only based on the photometric properties of the search class and the statistical uncertainties of the data .",
    "also , the @xmath0-nn search can be controlled by just two parameters ( the number of neighbors @xmath0 and the threshold distance @xmath1 ) , instead of many arbitrary cuts , which allows to quickly experiment different combination of variables , and optimize the search for maximum rejection efficiency and completeness .",
    "the examples presented in this paper show that the @xmath0-nn method is an effective procedure for the search of field and companion brown dwarfs in",
    "_ spitzer _ wide field surveys .",
    "this can be an important asset for the _ spitzer _ warm mission surveys .",
    "as these surveys will image areas of the sky where deep photometric catalogs in the optical and near - ir are already available , or in progress , the @xmath0-nn method can effectively select t dwarf candidates , potentially leading to a significant increase in the known number of members in this class .",
    "this is by no means the only potential application for this method .",
    "the method is general enough to allow the photometric selection of sources of any kind , as long as a sample of templates is available .",
    "if enough classes of templates are used , the @xmath0-nn method can be the engine for the photometric classification of all sources in a survey , by attributing to each source the class with the highest @xmath0-nn score .",
    "we are currently applying this method of classification to the point source catalog of the sage survey @xcite .",
