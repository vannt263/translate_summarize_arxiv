    "the second - order correlation ( soc ) function @xmath0 of radiation is a key quantity characterizing photon statistics as well as elucidating the underlying light generation mechanism .",
    "this correlation function is often interpreted as being proportional to the probability of measuring a photon at time zero and then measuring another photon at time @xmath3 . since the first observation of soc of light from a star by hanbury brown and twiss ( hbt ) @xcite , the measurement techniques for soc have progressed much as high - efficiency photo detectors and fast electronics have been developed .",
    "significant improvements were made by employing a time - to - digital converter or a time digitizer , which provides a digital representation of the time intervals between a start photodetection event at one detector and multiple stop events at the other detector . from these time intervals a histogram of the time delay between the start and stop events is obtained .",
    "this method is called the single - start multi - stop time - to - digital conversion(smtdc ) @xcite . in later experiments , a more efficient method which uses all of the arrival time records in both start and stop detectors was developed .",
    "this method is called the multi - start multi - stop time - to - digital conversion ( mmtdc ) compared to the conventional smtdc . in mmtdc , all of the arrival times at both detectors are recorded for a time window @xmath4 much longer than the correlation time @xmath5 of a radiation source . by software or by using a hardware correlator ,",
    "we then obtain the correlation of all detected photon pairs or more specifically a histogram of time intervals between all possible detected photon pairs .",
    "the number of detection events during @xmath4 on a start detector in mmtdc is given by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the quantum efficiency of the detector and @xmath8 is the incident photon flux .",
    "therefore , mmtdc is more efficient than smtdc , which uses only one start photon event , by this factor of @xmath9 . owing to this high efficiency , mmtdc has been successfully employed in the first observation of non - classical radiation @xcite and quantum frequency pulling @xcite in the cavity - qed microlaser and the spectrum of a single atom localized in an optical lattice @xcite .    for accurate measurement of soc , the effects of detector characteristics such as detection efficiency and dead time have also been investigated , where the latter is a time period in which a photo detector becomes blind after photodetection .",
    "although the soc function @xmath0 of light is independent of detector efficiency , it is apparent that in a single detector configuration detector dead time @xmath10 can seriously affect the measurement of @xmath0 .",
    "because of the detector dead time , @xmath0 is significantly reduced for @xmath11 near the origin . as a result",
    ", we lose the information on @xmath2 , an important parameter directly related to the photon statistics of a stationary radiation source as discussed below .",
    "no effective way to recover the lost information completely has been found for a single detector configuration despite many studies on this issue @xcite .    it is often argued that the dead - time deficiency may be completely removed in a two - detector configuration for stationary light sources .",
    "this is based on a simple reasoning that two successive photons within the detector dead time can be resolved if those two photons are detected on separate detectors : the first photon is detected on a start detector and the second photon is on a separate stop detector . for non - stationary light sources ,",
    "on the other hand , detector dead time has been shown to distort soc functions as discussed by choi _",

    "non - negligible distortion occurs in the soc function @xmath0 for @xmath11 .",
    "the distortion deepens as the incident photon flux @xmath8 increases and consequently the mean waiting time @xmath13 is reduced to approach @xmath10 .",
    "such distortion is critical especially for a nonclassical light source with a large internal mean photon number @xmath14 . for a stationary single mode light ,",
    "the relation @xmath15 @xcite holds with the mandel @xmath1 parameter bounded between -1 and 0 for nonclassical light . for a large mean photon number @xmath16",
    ", we then have @xmath17 , so even small distortion by the detector dead time can cause a large error in determining @xmath1 . in this work ,",
    "we first derive a formula quantifying the distortion in @xmath2 induced by the dead time and then verify its validity in actual experiments with the cavity - qed microlaser @xcite generating a stationary nonclassical radiation .",
    "we show that by using the formula we can recover @xmath2 and thus the mandel @xmath1 unaffected by the detector dead time .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we discuss dead time effect on mean photon flux measurement .",

    "two - detector configuration eliminates the distortion due to the missed successive photons on the same detector by considering two successive photon counting events only on separate start and stop detectors .",
    "however , there still exists another source of distortion coming from the reduction in counted photon flux due to the dead time .",
    "let us first consider a waiting - time distribution @xmath18 for a detector with a quantum efficiency @xmath7 but without dead time . if the photon statistics of light is poissonian like coherent light , the waiting - time distribution is given by a single exponential function : @xmath19 with @xmath20 , the dead - time - free photodetection flux for the incident light .",
    "the mean waiting time @xmath12 is then given by @xmath21 .",
    "in the presence of detector dead time , the waiting - time distribution is modified in such a way that it vanishes for @xmath22 with the rest still the same exponential as @xmath18 . when normalized , the modified waiting - time distribution @xmath23 is nothing but @xmath24 .",
    "it is then straightforward to show that the new mean waiting time @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 in the presence of the detector dead time , the photodetection flux @xmath27 for the incident light appears to be less than the dead - time - free photodetection flux @xmath28 by the following relation .",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) is no longer valid in general . for instance , let us consider light exhibiting sub - poisson photon statistics with its soc function given by @xmath32 with @xmath5 the correlation time .",

    "equation  ( [ eq2 ] ) shows that soc does not depend on the detector efficiency .    from now on , let us concentrate on @xmath2 , a parameter directly related to the mandel @xmath1 of the internal field of the source . in evaluating @xmath2 with eq .",
