    "in x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) , the studies of relativistic radio jets and their coupling with x - ray properties received a boost in the last decade thanks to coordinated multiwavelength observations .",
    "black hole ( bh ) systems are surely the best studied among the relativistic jet xrb sources ( see fender 2006 for a review ) . however",
    ", relativistic jets are not exclusively associated with bhs .",
    "the jet phenomenology observed in bhs can be found in neutron star ( ns ) xrbs as well : 1 ) highly - accreting ns xrbs can launch _ transient jets _ at ultra - relativistic velocities ( e.g. with bulk lorentz factors of more than 15 in cir  x-1 ; fender et al .",
    "2004 ) ; 2 ) low - luminosity ns xrbs can form a _ compact jet _ of the same kind observed in bh xrbs and active galactic nuclei ( i.e. 4u  0614 + 091 ; migliari et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the necessary ingredients for the formation and launch of relativistic jets seem not to be related to the nature of the compact object .",
    "therefore , studies of ns jets and their connections to the accretion properties have an important impact on our understanding of jet sources in general . in bh xrbs",
    ", studies of the accretion mode transitions and their coupling to the jet activity ( e.g. , fender , belloni & gallo 2005 ) rely on observations of occasional outbursts , of which there are  1 - 2 per year and which usually last a few months . in the case of ns xrbs and especially in the highly - accreting class of nss called ` z - type ' ( see below ) , we observe periodic x - ray state transitions on timescales of a few days .",
    "these state transitions are thought to be triggered by accretion rate changes .",
    "z sources can be considered as the ns ` counterparts ' of transient highly - accreting bhs like grs  1915 + 105 ( see e.g. discussion in migliari & fender 2005 ) .",
    "studying z - type nss , we are therefore able to assess the evolution of the accretion and jet activity in a very short observational time and more regularly than in transient bh sources .",
    "z - type ns xrbs are a class of seven among the brightest xrbs in our galaxy : sco  x-1 , cyg  x-2 , gx  17 + 2 , gx  5 - 1 , gx  340 + 0 , gx  349 + 2 and xte  j1701 - 462 ( eight if we add the ` peculiar ' z - source cir  x-1 ; shirey , bradt & levine 1999 ) . the name of the class derives from the characteristic ` z ' shape they trace in the color - color diagram ( cd ; hasinger & van der klis 1989 ; see van der klis 2006 for a review ) .",
    "the three branches which form the z - shaped cd are called the horizontal branch ( hb ) , normal branch ( nb ) and flaring branch ( fb ) , and define three distinct states of the systems , each with its own specific x - ray spectral and timing properties ( see e.g. homan et al .",
    "2002 for the specific case of gx  17 + 2 ) .",
    "the relations between spectral and timing properties and the position on the cd suggest the accretion rate as the major physical parameter behind the position along the z track ( e.g. van der klis 2006 for a review ) .",
    "homan et al . ( 2007 ) showed that the complex variability behaviour of xte  j1701 - 462 could be explained if the changes along the track are governed , not simply by the mass accretion rate through the disk , but by the ratio between this quantity and its time - averaged variations ( see also van der klis 2000 ) .",
    "z sources show luminosities persistently near or above the eddington limit and are very bright and rapidly variable both in x - rays and in the radio band .",
    "the z - type nss change x - ray states on timescales of hours to days , so they are always at the ` edge ' of state transitions .",
    "they are therefore very good laboratories to study the connection between x - ray properties , state changes and radio behaviour in x - ray binary systems .",
    "z - type nss show optically thick radio emission ( i.e. , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 is the flux density at the frequency @xmath3 ) and frequent optically thin radio flares ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the optically thick emission is usually interpreted as radiation from a continuously replenished compact jet ( see fender 2006 for a review ) , while the optically thin radio flares are possible signatures of fast ejected plasmons , already observed as extended lobes in sco  x-1 ( fomalont et al .",
    "2001a , b ) and cir  x-1 ( fender et al . 1999 ; fender et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "looking in detail at the radio behaviour of z sources as a function of their x - ray properties , penninx et al .",
    "( 1988 ) first found in gx  17 + 2 that the radio emission varied as a function of the position in the x - ray cd , decreasing with increasing inferred mass accretion rate from the hb ( strongest radio emission ) to the fb ( weakest radio emission ) .",
    "a behaviour consistent with gx  17 + 2 has been found also in cyg  x-2 ( hjellming et al 1990a ) and sco  x-1 ( hjellming et al 1990b ) , the exception seems to be gx  5 - 1 ( tan et al .",
    "1992 ; but see discussion in migliari & fender 2006 ) .",
    "based on the results of these previous simultaneous radio / x - ray observations and - mostly - on observations of sco x-1 ( fomalont et al . 2001b",
    "; bradshaw et al . 2003 ) , a possible coherent phenomenological picture of z sources , coupling x - rays ( @xmath5  kev ) and radio properties , has been drawn ( migliari & fender 2006 ) . in our sketch ,",
    "1 ) the compact jet is mostly responsible for the radio emission in the hb and partially in the nb ; 2 ) x - ray state transitions are coupled with transitions also in the jet emission , specifically transient radio optically thin flares appear to occur at the hb - to - nb transition ( see fig .  6 in migliari & fender 2006 ) .",
    "non - thermal hard tails in the x - ray energy spectra , dominating above @xmath6  kev , have been observed in almost all the known z sources : gx  5 - 1 ( asai et al . 1994 ) , gx  17 + 2 ( di salvo et al . 2000 ) , sco x-1 ( damico et al .",
    "2001a ) , gx  349 + 2 ( di salvo et al . 2001",
    "; see also damico et al .",
    "2001b ) , cir x-1 ( iaria et al . 2001 ) and cyg  x-2 ( di salvo et al .",
    "2002 ; see also damico et al .",
    "these hard x - ray tails can be fitted with a power law with photon index ranging between 1.6 and 3.3 , and can contribute up to 10% of the bolometric x - ray luminosity .",
    "although the details of the individual z sources are more complicated , we might say that , as a general trend , the hard x - ray tail in the spectrum seems to be related to the position in the cd : the hard x - ray component is strongest in the hb and becomes weaker towards the fb . in previous rxte observations of gx  17 + 2",
    ", for example , the spectrum showed a hard power - law tail with a photon index of @xmath7 which is strongest in the hb and weakens as the source moves towards the nb , disappearing in the nb ( di  salvo et al . 2000 ) .",
    "however , a clear counter example seems to be sco  x-1 , where no obvious relation between the hard tail x - ray flux and the position on the cd has been observed ( damico et al .",
    "the physical origin of this non - thermal component is still an area of controversy . in particular ,",
    "two main possibilities are under debate , both suggesting that the physical site of the emission is the central core region , close to the compact object : inverse compton from a non - thermal electron population in a ` corona ' ( e.g. poutanen & coppi 1998 ) or in the base of a jet ( see e.g. markoff , nowak & wilms 2005 for a discussion ) .",
    "another possible explanation , the bulk motion comptonization ( bmc ) which was first explored by titarchuck , mastichiadis & kylafis ( 1996 ) for bhs , has been proposed also for ns systems ( e.g. titarchuk & zannias 1998 ) . in the specific case of gx  17 + 2 , for example ,",
    "farinelli et al .",
    "( 2007 ) suggested that the spectrum derived from the bmc of soft photons by energetic electrons flowing on to the ns , can produce an x - ray hard tail consistent with the observations .    in this work we present a study of simultaneous radio and x - ray observations of the z source gx  17 + 2 , in order to assess the coupling between x - ray and radio properties throughout its three x - ray states (   3.1 ) and during the transitions between states (   3.2 ) .",
    "furthermore , these observations allow us , for the first time , to investigate more quantitatively the possible relations between the radio emission and the presence of the hard x - ray tails (   3.3 ) , observed to be associated with the position of the source in the cd .",
    "we have observed the z - type ns xrb gx  17 + 2 simultaneously in x - rays with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) and in the radio band with the very large array ( vla ) , covering all its three x - ray branches .",
    "rxte observed gx  17 + 2 starting on 2002 november 04 , for a total of @xmath8 hr over about 11 days .",
    "the 3 - 20  kev light curve of the observations is shown in fig .  1 , middle panels .",
    "we used the proportional counter array ( pca ) standard2 data of the proportional counter unit 2 ( working in all the observations ) to produce the cd and the hid of all the rxte observations of gx  17 + 2 .",
    "the soft color and the hard color are defined as the count rate ratio ( 4.67.1 )  kev/(2.94.6 )  kev and ( 10.519.6 )  kev/(7.110.5 )  kev , respectively . the hid in fig .",
    "2 clearly shows the three distinct x - ray branches of the source .    for the spectral analysis , we have extracted x - ray energy spectra using pca standard2 and hexte standard mode data . for the pca data",
    ", we subtracted the background estimated using pcabckest v3.0 , produced the detector response matrix with pcarsp v10.1 , and analysed the energy spectrum in the range 325  kev .",
    "a systematic error of 0.5% was added to account for uncertainties in the calibration . for the hexte data",
    ", we corrected for deadtime , subtracted the background , extracted the response matrix using ftools v.6.1.2 , and analysed the spectra between 20 and @xmath9  kev ( there is no significant detection above this energy in any of the observations ) .",
    "we show the log of the rxte observations in table  1 .",
    "the 3 - 100 kev spectra are well fitted ( see also di salvo et al .",
    "2000 ) using a black - body , a thermal comptonization model ( comptt ) , a gaussian emission line in the range 6.46.7 kev and an edge around 9 kev .",
    "an additional power law to account for an excess , of non - thermal origin , in the higher energy range above 30 kev is also necessary in three observations ( see   [ hardtail ] for a discussion ) . for a detailed x - ray spectral analysis of gx  17 + 2 with other models",
    "see e.g. farinelli et al .",
    "the best - fit parameters of each of the 3 - 100 kev spectra as a function of their position on the hid are shown in table  2 .",
    "the values are consistent with what was found in di salvo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .    for the temporal analysis ,",
    "we have used _ event _ and _ binned _ data with a time resolution of 125 @xmath10s for the production of the power density spectra .",
    "we used time bins such that the nyquist frequency is 4096  hz . for each observation we created power spectra from segments of 64s length using fast fourier",
    "transform techniques ( van der klis 1989 and references therein ) , but no background subtraction was performed .",
    "no deadtime corrections were done before creating the power spectra .",
    "we averaged the leahy - normalised power spectra ( leahy et al .",
    "1983 ) and subtracted the predicted poisson noise spectrum applying the method of zhang et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , shifted in power to match the spectrum between 3000 and 4000  hz .",
    "we converted the normalisation of the power spectra to squared fractional rms ( e.g. belloni & hasinger 1990 ; see van der klis 1995 ) .",
    "we observed gx17 + 2 with the vla at three different epochs on 2002 november 4 , 9 , and 15 , simultaneous with the _ rxte _ observations .",
    "the vla was in its c configuration at the time .",
    "the nrao project i d was ar495 .",
    "observing frequencies were 1.425 , 4.86 , 8.46 , 14.94 , 22.46 and 43.34ghz .",
    "observations were carried out in standard continuum mode at each frequency , with a 50-mhz bandwidth in each of two if pairs .",
    "the primary calibrator was 3c286 , used to set the flux scale according to the coefficients derived at the vla in 1999 as implemented in the 31dec05 version of the national radio astronomy observatory s ( nrao ) astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "the secondary calibrators were j1834126 ( @xmath11 from the target ) at 1.46ghz and j1832105 ( @xmath12 from the target ) at all higher frequencies .",
    "data calibration and imaging were performed using standard procedures within aips . at frequencies below 15ghz ,",
    "there were background sources present in the field , most notably an agn 88arcmin to the southwest , which had to be properly deconvolved from the image .",
    "the data were subjected to a single round of phase - only self - calibration before making separate images of the field in the time intervals corresponding to the different x - ray states . to obtain the time - resolved lightcurve of gx17",
    "+ 2 , the other sources in the field were subtracted from the _ uv_-data before measuring the source flux density using the aips task uvplt .",
    "in fig .  [ licu ] we show the 5 ghz and 8.5 ghz vla ( top ) , 3 - 20 kev rxte / pca ( middle ) and hard x - ray color ( bottom ) light curves of gx 17 + 2 .",
    "the simultaneous x - ray and radio light curves show no obvious correlations between the x - ray count rate and the radio flux densities .",
    "however , during the radio observations , we note an overall correlation between the mean radio flux density and the mean hard color ( top and bottom panels ) : the higher the mean radio flux density , the higher the hard color .",
    "more specifically , the radio emission is strongly related to the position in the hid . in fig .",
    "[ hid ] , we show the hid of gx  17 + 2 : the gray dots are the pca observations with a time resolution of 16 seconds and the superimposed open circles indicate the radio emission strength : the bigger the circle , the more radio flux density .",
    "we clearly see that the radio flux density is strictly related to the position in the hid , in a way consistent with previous observations ( penninx et al .",
    "1988 ) and with the disc - jet coupling scenario described in migliari & fender ( 2006 ) : the radio flux density increases from the fb to the nb and is highest in the hb .",
    "we also note an enhancement of radio flux density in the hb ( i.e. what we called hb@xmath13 ) , corresponding to an increase in intensity of the source , with no significant change in hard color .",
    "the overall radio emission is consistent with being optically thick exept possibly for the observations during the hb@xmath13 , which correspond to what seems to be the decay of an optically thin radio flare ( with @xmath14 , measured by fitting the flux densities at 1.4 , 5 , 8.5 and 15  ghz , of the averaged observations for the range of times @xmath15  sec from the beginning of our observations ; see fig .",

    "[ licu ] , _ might _ be associated with the ( preceding ) x - ray count rate decay shown in the middle - left panel . in this case",
    ", a possible scenario would be that of a radio flare associated with the nb - to - hb transition ( not observed ) , of which we only see the decaying part .",
    "however , the x - ray count rate decay can also be the decay of a long type - i x - ray burst of the same kind observed for this source in previous rxte observations ( see e.g. the long ` burst 6 ' reported in kuulkers et al .",
    "indeed , the x - ray decay shown in the pca light curve seems to be exponential , supporting the interpretation as a type - i burst .",
    "we tried to investigate this possibility by fitting the 2 - 25 kev pca energy spectrum of the x - ray decay ( the first 1700 seconds of the observation 70023 - 01 - 01 - 01 ) with the model described in ",
    "2.1 , without the power - law component , plus an extra blackbody component to account for the possible thermal emission from the surface of the ns , but the additional blackbody does not give a significant statistical improvement to the fit .",
    "the radio / x - ray flux decay simultaneity would be , in the case of a type - i burst , only accidental .",
    "the hid in fig .",
    "[ hid ] shows that during the fb , no radio emission is detected , while emission , although weak , is observed in the lower nb .",
    "our observations cover the exact time in which the source transits from the fb to the lower nb ( panels of the middle - column in fig .",
    "[ licu ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ jet - form ] , we show the radio and x - ray light curves of gx  17 + 2 during the transition from fb to nb . the first panel from the top shows the radio light curve at 8.5 ghz ( re - binned to a higher temporal resolution with respect to that in fig .",
    "[ licu ] ) .",
    "the second panel shows the x - ray pca light curve . in the first part of the observation ,",
    "i.e. before @xmath17  sec the source is not significantly detected ( with a nominal flux density of @xmath18  mjy ) . however , after @xmath19  sec the radio source is detected at 8.5 ghz at a significance level of @xmath20 and at 5  ghz at a significance level of @xmath21 .",

    "physically , we interpret this as a compact jet that switches - on soon after the fb - to - nb transition .",
    "( note that , since the radio spectral index is not well constrained , an optically thin radio flare can not be ruled out . )",
    "a sketch of the ( phenomenological ) jet / x - ray state coupling model for z sources adapted from migliari & fender ( 2006 ) to include this result is shown in the top - right panel of fig .",
    "[ hid ] . for clarity ,",
    "the drawings of the jet in the top - right panel refer only to the cycle from hb to fb . indeed",
    ", if a compact jet is reformed during the fb - to - nb transition , optically thin shocks and transient jets may not be present in the nb .    in fig .",
    "[ jet - form ] , the third panels from the top show the dynamical power density spectra of the two orbits ( in black are evident the changes in the characteristic frequency of the qpos ) , and the bottom panels show the positions of the observations on the hid as black markers .",
    "the lower fb is usually characterized by the presence of the so - called flaring branch oscillation ( fbo ) , which has a typical characteristic frequency above 14  hz , while the nb power density spectra usually show the so - called normal branch oscillation ( nbo ) , which has a typical characteristic frequency below 10  hz ( see homan et al .",
    "the first rxte / pca orbit shows the actual x - ray state transition from the fb to the lower nb : the black markers in the hid are spread in between the fb and the nb , and the dynamical power density spectrum shows a transition between the fbo and the nbo , with the qpo frequency oscillating between the typical frequencies of the two qpos ; the fit of the averaged power density spectrum gives a characteristic frequency of @xmath23 ( the same kind of ` intermediate ' qpo has been already observed in previous observations of gx  17 + 2 : homan et al .",
    "the qpo stabilizes into a nbo only in the second orbit with a characteristic frequency of @xmath24  hz .",
    "this stable nbo is simultaneous with a clear renewed radio activity of the source .",
    "as the qpo frequency stabilizes into a nbo , the compact jet appears to re - establish itself .",
    "the parallel between the stability of the nbo and the radio emission , and since in z - sources the nbo , as well as the radio emission , has been observed in all the x - ray states with the exeption of the fb , suggests a relation between the formation of the jet and the x - ray variability associated to the nbo . in an attempt to draw analogies between",
    "the fast x - ray variability observed in z sources and in bh xrbs , casella , belloni & stella ( 2005 ) studied the properties of the low - frequency qpos in the two types of systems , and related the fbo to the so - called ` type - a ' qpo , the nbo to the ` type - b ' qpo and the hbo to the ` type - c ' qpo . in this framework , the jet formation in bhs might be related to the type - b qpo , and/or to the transition between the type - a to the type - b qpo .",
    "an association between the presence of qpos and radio jet activity , similar to what we see in gx  17 + 2 , can be found in some bh xrbs , albeit with a much slower time - scale .",
    "a clear example comes from the multiwavelength studies of the decay of the outburst in h1743 - 322 ( kalemci et al .",
    "the power density spectrum of the source shows a low - frequency qpo that appears during the transition from the thermal / soft state , where the radio jet is undetected , to the hard x - ray state ( see also e.g. homan & belloni 2005 ) . while the source is in an intermediate state and entering the hard state , the characteristic frequency of the qpo decreases in time ( possibly also changing ` type ' ; in their work kalemci et al .",
    "did not classify the qpos by ` type ' ) and , when the source is in its hard state , the radio jet renews its activity .    in the bright atoll source gx  13 + 1 ,",
    "homan et al . ( 2004 ) observed a delay of approximately 40 minutes between the changes in the x - ray spectral hardness and the following radio flares .",
    "in gx  17 + 2 , we observe renewed radio activity around @xmath25  sec ( fig .",
    "[ jet - form ] , top ) . if we associate this radio flux increase with the preceding fb - to - nb transition , the delay is @xmath26  hr . this time - delay is about three times that found in gx  13 + 1 and about twice the delays observed in the highly - accreting bh xrb grs  1915 + 105 between the beginning of the x - ray hard dips and the following radio flares ( see klein - wolt et al .",
    "2002 ) , i.e. taking the hard x - ray dips duration as the time that it takes the compact jet to re - form .",
    "if , on the other hand , the radio activity is associated with the stability of the characteristic frequency of the nbo , we obtain an upper limit on the x - ray / radio activity delay of @xmath27  s , consistent with what has been observed in the ns gx  13 + 1 and the bh grs  1915 + 105 . for comparison , more ` traditional ' bhs like h1743 - 322 or 4u  1543 - 47 ( kalemci et al . 2005 , 2006 ) , during the decay of the outburst show a time delay between the end of the thermal / soft state and the detection of the radio jet of at least a few days .",
    "we have analysed the 3 - 100 kev energy spectra of five observations along the hid . in table  2",
    "we show the best - fit parameters of the x - ray energy spectra using the model described in   2.1 .",
    "a hard x - ray tail is present in the hb@xmath13 and hb ( an f - test for the addition of a power - law component gives a chance improvement probability of @xmath28 in hb@xmath13 and @xmath29 in hb ; fig .",
    "[ tail ] , top panel ) , and the 2100  kev flux in the power - law component is approximately 15% and 10% , respectively , of the total 2 - 100 kev flux of the source . in the nb",
    "an extra power - law component is also needed in the fit of the energy spectrum ( an f - test gives @xmath30 chance probability ) , but the power - law flux decreases to approximately 1% of the total 2 - 100 kev flux .",
    "no additional component is needed to the spectral fits when the source is in nb@xmath31 and in the fb ( fig .",
    "[ tail ] , lower panel ) .",
    "therefore , we confirm that in gx  17 + 2 there is a clear correspondence between the presence of a hard tail in the x - ray spectra and the position on the hid .",
    "the behaviour of the hard x - ray tail in gx  17 + 2 as a function of the position in the hid is qualitatively the same as that observed for the radio emission , suggesting a common physical driver for the production of the radio and hard x - ray tail emission . in order to quantify this qualitative radio emission / hard tail correspondence , in fig .",
    "[ radio - tail ] we plot the mean radio flux density at 8.5 ghz against the 2 - 100 kev flux of the hard tail power - law component for the observations in fb , nb@xmath31 , nb , hb , hb@xmath13 .",
    "the three observations for which the presence of the x - ray power law and the radio emission is significantly detected show a positive correlation between the two quantities ( with a correlation coefficient of 99% ) : the radio flux density increases as the power - law x - ray flux increases .",
    "the upper limits on the other two observations are consistent with this trend .",
    "however , given the present statistics , the correlation can not be firmly constrained and other observations are needed in order to confirm and properly quantify the radio / hard x - ray dependence .    in bh systems , it has been suggested that the comptonising corona gets ejected during a radio flare ( e.g. vadawale et al .",
    "2003 ; fender , belloni & gallo 2004 ) ; hence the transition of the source into the soft state . in the ns system gx  17 + 2",
    ", we appear to see a correlation between the hard x - ray tail and the radio emission , with a strong hard x - ray tail also present during a radio flare .",
    "however , although during the hb@xmath13 observation what we see is likely the decay portion of a radio flare , thus associated with a preceding ` transient ' ejection , the radio spectra of gx  17 + 2 during the other x - ray states are consistent with the emission from a ` compact ' jet .",
    "the compact jet , which can be present also during the hb@xmath13 , is what appears to be associated with the hard x - ray tail .",
    "similarly , in bh systems the radio compact jet is observed in the quiescent / hard state , when also a hard comptonizing ` corona ' is present .",
    "we have analysed simultaneous radio ( vla ) and x - ray ( rxte ) observations covering all the three x - ray branches of the z - type ns xrb gx  17 + 2 and found : +    * a relation between the radio emission and the position in the hid : the radio flux density is strongest in the hb , decreases in the nb , and is weakest in the fb ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "* a relation between the presence of a hard x - ray tail and the position on the hid : the hard power - law tail is observed in the hb , in the nb , and is not detected in the lower nb and in the fb ( fig .  4 and table  2 ) . * a link between x - ray state transitions and the jet activity : a jet , likely a compact jet , forms soon after the fb - to - nb transition , with a time delay of less than 2  hr ( fig .",
    "* the radio emission of the jet ( re-)formed after the fb - to - nb state transition stabilizes when the nbo characteristic frequency in the x - ray power spectrum also stabilizes ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "this finding , together with the fact that in z - sources the nbo , as well as the radio emission , has been observed in all the x - ray states with the exception of the fb , suggest a relation between the formation of the jet and the x - ray variability associated to the nbo . a similar behaviour , albeit with a longer time - scale , may be found in bh systems , where the decrease of the characteristic frequency and change of ` type ' of the low - frequency qpo is followed by a renewed activity of the jet ( see   [ jetswitch ] ) . * an indication for a quantitative relation between radio emission and the hard tail in the x - ray spectrum",
    ": there is a positive correlation between the hard tail power - law x - ray flux and the radio flux density ( fig .  5 ) .",
    "if further confirmed with a larger sample and improved statistics , especially in the hard x - ray tail flux measurement , this relation would point to a common mechanism for the production of the jet and the hard x - ray tails in the system .",

    "<S> we present the results from simultaneous radio ( very large array ) and x - ray ( rossi - x - ray timing explorer ) observations of the z - type neutron star x - ray binary gx  17 + 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the aim is to assess the coupling between x - ray and radio properties throughout its three rapidly variable x - ray states and during the time - resolved transitions . </S>",
    "<S> these observations allow us , for the first time , to investigate quantitatively the possible relations between the radio emission and the presence of the hard x - ray tails and the x - ray state of the source . </S>",
    "<S> the observations show : 1 ) a coupling between the radio jet emission and the x - ray state of the source , i.e. the position in the x - ray hardness - intensity diagram ( hid ) ; 2 ) a coupling between the presence of a hard x - ray tail and the position in the hid , qualitatively similar to that found for the radio emission ; 3 ) an indication for a quantitative positive correlation between the radio flux density and the x - ray flux in the hard - tail power law component ; 4 ) evidence for the formation of a radio jet associated with the flaring branch - to - normal branch x - ray state transition ; 5 ) that the radio flux density of the newly - formed jet stabilizes when also the normal - branch oscillation ( nbo ) in the x - ray power spectrum stabilizes its characteristic frequency , suggesting a possible relation between x - ray variability associated to the nbo and the jet formation . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss our results in the context of jet models . </S>"
