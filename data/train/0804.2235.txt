    "understanding the scaling properties of fracture surfaces still represents an unsolved problem despite two decades of intense research activities @xcite .",
    "experiments on several materials under different loading conditions have shown that the fracture surface is self - affine @xcite and can be characterized by a roughness exponent @xmath1 .",
    "experiments on several materials including metals @xcite , glass @xcite , rocks @xcite and ceramics @xcite , have shown a universal out of plane roughness exponent of @xmath6 for three - dimensional fracture surfaces irrespective of the material studied , as revieved in ref .",
    "recent experimental evidence shows , however , that the picture is more complicated : such scaling is valid at small and intermediate scales in the so - called fracture process zone ( fpz ) , while at large scales one observes a new regime with @xmath7 attributed to crack line depinning @xcite .",
    "recent numerical investigations of the random fuse model indicate that the local roughness exponent in two dimensions does not depend on the size of the fpz , but only on the fact that a fpz is present or not @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is by no means a priori clear that `` simple '' self - affinity is sufficient to describe the experiments .",
    "it has been argued that fracture surfaces may exhibit anomalous scaling @xcite : the _ global _ exponent describing the scaling of the crack width with the sample size is larger than the local exponent measured on a single sample @xcite . in this sense , it is necessary to introduce two roughness exponents a global exponent ( @xmath1 ) and a local exponent ( @xmath0 ) to define the roughness of fracture surfaces .",
    "anomalous scaling is noted in the numerical simulations as well @xcite ; however , its origin is not clear yet although in experiments it is conjectured to be an artifact of initial transient regime as the fracture front moves away from the initial notch @xcite .",
    "recent studies @xcite also suggest that the origin of anomalous scaling in numerical simulations in two dimensions may also be due to the existence of overhangs ( jumps ) in the crack profile , originating from crack branching . as a further complication",
    ", there is an on - going debate whether fracture surfaces exhibit multi - affine scaling @xcite , implying that one would observe a whole family of roughness exponents @xmath8 depending on which statistical moment @xmath9 of the correlation function is measured .",
    "the theoretical understanding of the origin and universality of crack surface roughness is often investigated by discrete lattice ( fuse , central - force , and beam ) models @xcite . in these models",
    "the elastic medium is described by a network of discrete elements such as fuses , springs and beams with random failure thresholds . in the simplest approximation of a scalar displacement ,",
    "one recovers the random fuse model ( rfm ) where a lattice of fuses with random threshold are subject to an increasing external voltage @xcite . using two - dimensional rfm , the estimated crack surface roughness exponents are : @xmath10 @xcite , @xmath11 @xcite , and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "recently , using large system sizes ( up to @xmath13 ) with extensive sample averaging , we found that the crack roughness exhibits anomalous scaling @xcite .",
    "in particular , the local and global roughness exponents estimated using two different lattice topologies are : @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the reasons behind the origin of anomalous scaling in numerical simulations are not yet clear , although the existence of overhangs in the crack profile is expected to have contributed to anomalous scaling @xcite . in comparison ,",
    "the roughness exponents obtained from quasi two - dimensional experiments , mainly obtained for paper samples , indicate a roughness exponent in the range @xmath16 @xcite , but occasionally significantly higher values have also been reported @xcite .",
    "it is not known at this time whether this variation in @xmath1 values is a reflection of practical difficulties in experimentally measuring @xmath1 - in paper it is difficult to have a scaling range spanning over several decades since the structure becomes three - dimensional at small scales ( 0.1 mm ) and at the millimeter range the fiber length interferes - or that the roughness exponent is not really universal but depends on material parameters and the anisotropy of the medium .    despite this reasonable agreement between the numerical results obtained using two - dimensional rfm and the above quasi - two - dimensional experimental results ,",
    "a lingering question is whether scalar representation of the elastic medium using random fuse models is an adequate representation of fracture .",
    "moreover , it is an intriguing question whether the same roughness exponents as those obtained using rfm will be obtained using more complex random threshold central - force ( spring ) and beam models . using central - force models , a roughness exponent of @xmath17",
    "is obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . a more recent study with a range of disorder strengths in random thresholds estimated the local and global roughness exponents to be in the range @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively @xcite . using two - dimensional beam simulations ,",
    "@xcite estimated a typical value for the global roughness exponent to be @xmath20 ; however , the roughness exponent is argued to be disorder dependent .",
    "similar disorder dependent roughness exponents have also been reported recently for the rfm @xcite .",
    "these results were obtained in the square lattice and were attributed to a lattice effect at low disorder .",
    "they indeed disappear for triangular lattice , where the roughness exponent is the same independent on disorder @xcite .",
    "the questions we address in this article are the following : ( i ) whether anomalous scaling is present in two - dimensional fracture simulations using beam lattice systems , and ( ii ) whether roughness exponents so measured using beam lattice systems are in agreement with those obtained using simplified scalar rfm models . along the way",
    ", we also address why scalar rfm models have been successful in representing fracture in a disordered elastic medium .",
    "recent studies @xcite have shown that multi - affinity of fracture surfaces is an artifact of overhangs ( or jumps ) in the crack profile . here",
    ", we further investigate the influence of these overhangs in the crack profiles on crack roughness exponents .",
    "this article has three further sections : in the next one , we describe the beam model used . in section iii ,",
    "we present the numerical results obtained with it .",

    "we assume that the beams are connected rigidly at each of the nodes such that the angle between any two beams connected at a node remains unaltered during the deformation process .",
    "these nodal displacements and rotations introduce conjugate forces and bending moments in the beam members . using timoshenko beam theory @xcite , which includes shear deformations of the beam cross - section in addition to the usual axial deformation of cross - sections , the _ local _ stiffness matrix for a beam element that relates the local nodal displacements and rotations to local nodal forces and bending moments in the beam s _ local _ coordinate system is given by @xmath25 \\label{klocal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the young s modulus",

    "this results in a unit axial stiffness ( @xmath60 ) and bending stiffness ( @xmath61 ) for each of the beams in the lattice system .",
    "since the beam can deform in two independent deformation modes ( axial and bending ) , we assume randomly distributed bond breaking axial and bending thresholds , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , based on thresholds probability distributions , @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively .",

    "the forces are redistributed instantaneously after a bond is broken implying that the stress relaxation in the lattice system is much faster than the breaking of a bond . each time a bond is broken ,",
    "it is necessary to re - equilibrate the lattice system in order to determine the subsequent breaking of a bond .",
    "the process of breaking of a bond , one at a time , is repeated until the lattice system falls apart . for the rbm",
    ", we consider a uniform probability distribution in @xmath79 $ ] for both axial and bending thresholds disorders .",
    "numerical simulations of fracture using lattice networks have often been limited to smaller system sizes due to the high computational cost associated with solving a new large set of linear equations every time a new lattice bond is broken . in this work ,",
    "we use the multiple - rank sparse cholesky factorization downdating algorithm developed by the authors for simulating fracture using discrete beam lattice systems @xcite . for two - dimensional systems ,",
    "this low - rank cholesky factor downdating algorithm is significantly faster than competing preconditioned conjugate - gradient based iterative solvers . using this numerical algorithm",

    "in summary , the analysis and results presented in this paper indicate that crack profiles obtained in fracture simulations using the beam lattice systems do not exhibit anomalous scaling of roughness in contrast with those obtained using the fuse lattice systems .",
    "the local roughness exponent @xmath150 obtained using the beam lattice simulations is in good agreement with the earlier results obtained using the central - force spring models ( @xmath150 ) @xcite and is rather close to that of the fuse models @xmath151 @xcite .",

    "this result was attributed to bias due to the lattice topology .",
    "in fact , for the trangular lattice this effect is not seen and the roughness exponent is universal @xcite .",
    "lattice could also explain the difference between the present result for the beam model ( @xmath150 ) and previous disorder dependent results obtained for the square lattice @xcite .",
    "the agreement in the local roughness exponent between the beam , spring , and possibly fuse models is interesting to note because of these model s dissimilarity in representing deformation of an elastic medium .",
    "this seems to imply that the anisotropy in the stress redistribution in tensorial models is irrelevant for the roughness , at least in two dimensions .",
    "we even obtain the same local roughness exponent by considering a simplified rbm in which failure events form a connected crack thereby excluding damage nucleation in the bulk .",
    "this simplified beam model is similar to the simplified random thresholds fuse model ( rfm ) considered in the ref .",
    "@xcite . in this model , after breaking the weakest beam , successive failure events are only allowed on beams that are connected to the crack .",
    "otherwise , the rules of this simplified model strictly follow those of the usual rbm .",
    "consequently , this model tracks only the connected crack along with its dangling ends in a disordered medium , and hence forms the most simplified model to study the effect of disorder on crack roughness .    as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite for the fuse models , this simplified beam model exhibits the same local roughness and power spectra characteristics as that of conventional rbm ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : movps_sing]a ) .",
    "this implies that one can expect to obtain same local roughness exponent as long as there exists a fracture process zone around the cracks .",

    "[ fig : movps_sing]a indicates the existence of anomalous scaling of roughness as soon as the branching of the cracks is allowed @xcite . however , removing the jumps in the crack profiles eliminates this anomalous scaling as can be seen from the collapse of power spectra shown in fig .",

    "thus it appears that the anomalous roughness is two - dimensional fracture simulations arises due to crack branching and coalescence of microcracks , which induce jumps in the crack profiles .",
    "it should also be noted that anomalous scaling of crack roughness is readily evident in fracture simulations obtained using fuse lattice systems .",
    "the reason for this greater propensity to exhibit anomalous scaling in fuse lattice systems appears to be due to scalar nature of fuse systems ( anti - planar shear model ) , which readily allows for crack branching thereby inducing jumps in crack profiles .",
