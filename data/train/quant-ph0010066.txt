    "a multilevel atom having closely lying energy states ( energy separation of the order of the natural linewidth ) can show interferences in the decays from those closely lying levels to a common ground state .",
    "this is due to the fact that , both the decay channels are coupled via the same continuum of the vacuum , creating the interfering path ways .",
    "the resulting coherence in the system is known as _ vacuum induced coherence _",
    "occurrence of this coherence requires a stringent but achievable condition - i.e. the transition dipole matrix elements involving the decay processes should be _ non - orthogonal _",
    "the manifestation of vic in atomic systems has given rise to a myriad of fascinating phenomena [ 1 - 17 ] .",
    "all these studies deal with a _",
    "single _ multilevel atom or equivalently with an ensemble of non - interacting multilevel atoms ( e.g. very low density atomic gas systems ) .",
    "however , vic in _ coupled _ atomic systems has remained unexplored . in this paper , we consider the role of vic in _ two radiatively coupled multilevel atoms_.    we start by recalling some of the consequences of vic in a single atom .",
    "it was first shown by agarwal @xcite that population gets trapped in degenerate excited states of an atom due to interference in decays channels .",
    "recently , there has been renewed interest in this subject particularly in the context of coherently driven systems @xcite .",
    "harris and imamolu were the first to discover the possibility of achieving lasing without population inversion in systems where two excited states were coupled to a common continuum @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it has also been been observed that narrowing of spontaneous emission can be obtained by making use of the vic @xcite .",
    "quantum beat has been observed in spontaneous emission which showed pronounced beat structures determined by the energy separation of the closely lying states @xcite .",
    "the vic also leads to cancellation of spontaneous emission @xcite .",
    "zhu and coworkers have experimentally demonstrated the quenching of spontaneous emission in sodium dimers @xcite .",
    "further scully , zhu and coworkers proposed many schemes with different configurations demonstrating the possibility of obtaining quenching of spontaneous emission @xcite .",
    "it was also reported that in the presence of vic , the resonance fluorescence @xcite and other spectral line shapes @xcite become sensitive to the phase of the control laser .",
    "knight and coworkers @xcite have demonstrated the possibility of controlling spontaneous emission by varying the relative phase of two control lasers in a four - level system .",
    "the question of requirement of non - orthogonal dipole moments has been addressed and alternative possibilities have been suggested @xcite .",
    "all the above works [ 2 - 17 ] correspond to a single atom system , or equivalently an ensemble of non - interacting atoms where the average inter - atomic distance is much larger compared to the wavelength of the emitted radiation .",
    "however , when the inter - atomic distance becomes comparable to the wavelength , the dipole - dipole ( dd ) coupling between the atoms via vacuum gives rise to collective effects .",
    "our usage of dd interaction should be understood in the sense of retarded ( and complex ) dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "the classic example is dicke superradiance @xcite , where the atoms in their excited state decay much faster compared to that of the single atom case .",
    "the collective effects in atoms have been extensively studied [ 18 - 30 ] .",
    "recently experiments have been reported to observe collective behavior with two identical atoms @xcite .",
    "the dd interaction has been shown to produce two - photon resonance @xcite and frequency shifts in emission @xcite .",
    "the energy exchange between two coupled systems is discussed in @xcite .",
    "many interesting features of dd interaction in the context of atoms interacting with a squeezed vacuum @xcite , and inside bandgap materials @xcite have been reported .",
    "mayer and yeoman @xcite have considered two - atom laser in the presence of the atom - atom interaction .",
    "quantum jump from two dipole interacting v - systems giving rise to new fluorescence periods has been reported by hegerfeldt and coworkers @xcite .",
    "meystre and coworkers @xcite found that the dd interaction leads to the occurrence of dark states in the fluorescence of two moving atoms @xcite .",
    "finally note that the local field effects in a dense media are also a consequence of dd interaction @xcite .",
    "all the dd interaction related effects can be understood as due to the exchange of virtual photons between the atoms .",

    "note that the initial evolution of @xmath124 is much slower compared to the evolution of @xmath123 .",

    "the probability of atom @xmath25 staying in @xmath0 decays exponentially in the absence of atom @xmath29 .",
    "however , in the presence of the second atom , the nature of its decay is significantly modified - large oscillations are seen in @xmath137 in the presence of the new coherence terms , which is evident from fig .  7 .",
    "the origin of this oscillation is attributed to the large values of @xmath86 .",
    "in this section we consider the new coherence effects in two @xmath77-systems with @xmath138-degenerate magnetic sub - levels as excited states .",
    "the system could be , for example , a @xmath139ca system - where @xmath140 degenerate sublevels would correspond to the excited states @xmath141 and @xmath142 , and the @xmath143 state would correspond to the ground state @xmath6 . in this case the dipole matrix elements @xmath27 and @xmath28 are complex and orthogonal to each other , and are given by @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the reduced dipole matrix element .",

    "<S> we discuss in detail the origin of the new interference terms and their consequences . </S>",
    "<S> such terms lead to the evolution of certain coherences and excitations which would not occur otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> the special choice of the orientation of the transition dipole matrix elements enables us to illustrate the significance of vacuum induced coherence in multi - atom multilevel systems . </S>",
    "<S> these coherences can be significant in energy transfer studies . </S>"
