    "representing the quantum state of a many - electron system in terms of one - electron orbitals is simple and theoretically attractive approach .",
    "such description is realized in the hartree - fock ( hf ) method @xcite , as well as in the kohn - sham ( ks ) scheme of the density - functional theory ( dft ) @xcite .",
    "the latter is an efficient and robust tool which is now routinely applied in the calculations of electronic properties of molecules , even very large and complex , and condensed - matter structures . though the ks scheme is formally accurate , the one - body ks potential contains the exchange - correlation ( xc ) potential @xmath2 , whose exact dependence on the electron density remains unknown .",
    "it is usually treated within the local - density or generalized - gradient approximations ( lda , gga ) , despite the well - known shortcomings of the lda and gga xc potentials ( especially the self - interaction errors ) .",
    "some of these deficiencies are removed when the exact form ( in terms of the occupied ks orbitals ) is used for the exchange part @xmath3 of the xc energy .",
    "the exact exchange potential @xmath4 is then found from @xmath3 by means of the integral equation resulting from the optimized - effective - potential ( oep ) approach [ ( a ) , ] or by using the recently developed method based on the differential equations for the orbital shifts @xcite ; another method based on the direct energy minimization with respect to the ks - oep potential ( expressed in a finite basis ) @xcite suffers from convergence problems @xcite which are not fully resolved yet and they are still under study@xcite .",
    "the exact potential @xmath4 is free from self - interaction and it has correct asymptotic dependence ( @xmath5 for finite systems ) at large distances @xmath6 from the system ; thus , unlike the hf , lda or gga potentials , it produces correct unoccupied states . in the dft",
    ", the approximation , in which the exchange is included exactly but the correlation energy and potential are neglected , is known as the exchange - only ks scheme  it is applied in the present investigation .",
    "the full potential @xmath2 can also be found by means of the oep approach when the dft total energy includes , besides the exact @xmath3 , the correlation energy @xmath7 depending on all ( occupied and unoccupied ) ks orbitals and orbital energies @xcite .",
    "this makes such computation tedious , to a level undesirable in the dft , since it involves calculating @xmath7 with the quantum - chemistry methods , like the mller - plesset many - body perturbation approach .",
    "defined to yield the true electron density , the ks one - electron orbitals have no other direct physical meaning since they formally refer to a _ fictitious _ system of _ non - interacting _ electrons .",
    "however , it is a common practice to use these orbitals in calculations of various electronic properties ; in doing so the @xmath8-electron ground - state wave function @xmath9 of the physical ( interacting ) system is approximated with the single determinant built of the ks orbitals .",
    "this approximate approach is justified by ( usually ) sufficient accuracy of the calculated quantities , which is close to , or often better than , that of the hf results @xcite .",
    "it seems that the success of the dft calculations would not be possible if the ks determinant , though being formally non - physical , was not close to the hf determinant which , outside the dft , is routinely used to approximate the wave function @xmath9 of the _ real _ system .",
    "therefore , understanding this proximity is certainly very important for the fundamentals of the dft .",
    "previous calculations [ ( a ) , ] have shown that , not only the whole ks and hf determinants @xcite and the corresponding electron densities [ ( a ) , ] , but also the _ individual occupied _ ks and hf orbitals , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , in atoms are so close to each other that they are virtually indistinguishable ( here the orbitals , dependent on the electron position @xmath12 and the spin @xmath13 , @xmath14 , are numbered with index @xmath15 ; @xmath16 ) .",
    "this property is particularly remarkable for the exchange - only ks orbitals which differ so minutely from the hf orbitals that , for atoms , the oep total energy is only several mhartrees higher than the hf energy @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the outstanding proximity of the ks and hf orbitals is surprising in view of the obvious difference between the exchange operators in the ks and hf one - electron hamiltonians ( see below ) and the fact that the corresponding ks and hf atomic orbital energies , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , differ substantially , up to several hartrees for core orbitals in atoms like ar , cu @xcite [ except for the ks and hf energies of the highest - occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) which are almost identical ] .",
    "this apparent contradiction has not yet been resolved ; in ref . @xcite it is suggested that the ks and hf determinants are close to each other  since the kinetic energy is much greater than the magnitude of the exchange energy \" .",
    "the present paper investigates the proximity of the ks and hf orbitals and it reveals that , in closed-@xmath0-shell atoms , there exists a direct mapping between the hf orbital local exchange potentials @xmath20 and the dft exact local exchange potential @xmath21 .",
    "the former are specific to each hf orbital @xmath11 and are defined as @xmath22 with the fock exchange non - local operator @xmath23 within the hf approximation that describes the interacting system .",
    "the dft exchange potential @xmath21 is common for all orbitals relevant to the ks non - interacting @xmath24 subsystem .",
    "this potential is found to be very well represented , within the region of each atomic shell , by the _",
    ", suitably shifted potentials @xmath25 obtained for the hf orbitals that belong to this shell ; the constant shifts @xmath26 are orbital - specific . as a result",
    ", for each shell , the weighted average of the potentials @xmath27 corresponding to the orbitals from this shell yields the shell - specific exchange potential that also represents @xmath21 with high accuracy within the shell region .",
    "the revealed mapping between @xmath27 and @xmath21 is shown to have origins in the specific relations satisfied by the hf orbital exchange potentials .",
    "thus , the proximity of the ks and hf orbitals is explained .",
    "simultaneously , it becomes clear why , in atoms , the exact exchange potential @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 ) has the characteristic structure of a piecewise function where each part spans over the region of an atomic shell and it has distinctively different slope @xmath30 in consecutive shells @xcite .    the specific properties of @xmath20 are also shown to be directly responsible for the high quality of the approximate representations of the exact exchange potential @xmath21 that are obtained in the krieger - li - iafrate(kli ) @xcite and localized hf ( lhf)@xcite approximations , the latter of which is equivalent to the common - energy - denominator approximation ( ceda ) @xcite .",
    "the constant shifts @xmath26 , needed to map the hf potentials @xmath20 onto @xmath21 , are shown to be nearly equal to @xmath31 .",
    "this leads to better understanding why , for each ks occupied orbital ( other than the homo ) , its energy @xmath18 is higher than the corresponding hf energy @xmath19 and the difference between these two energies is larger for the core orbitals than for the valence ones . finally , it is shortly argued that the presently revealed properties of the ks and hf exchange potentials do _ not _ result from the well - known step - like shell structure present in the response part @xmath32 of the exchange potential @xcite .",
    "the hf one - electron spin - orbitals @xmath33 are obtained by minimizing the mean value @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the hamiltonian of the @xmath8-electron interacting system and @xmath36 belongs to the subspace @xmath37 of normalized @xmath8-electron wave functions that are single slater determinants built of one - electron orbitals .",
    "similar minimization is carried out in the exchange - only oep method , but there is the additional constraint that for every trial determinant all @xmath38 constituent spin - orbitals @xmath10 satisfy the ks equation with some local ks potential @xmath39 .",
    "the minimizing potential @xmath40 , yields , after subtracting from it the external @xmath41 and electrostatic @xmath42 terms , the exact exchange potential @xmath43 ( corresponding to the density @xmath44 calculated from occupied @xmath45 ) , so that we have @xmath46 it has to be stressed here that the proximity of the exchange - only ks and hf orbitals is _ not _ readily implied by the fact the two sets of orbitals result from the minimization of the same functional of energy , i.e. , @xmath47=\\langle \\psi |\\hat h|\\psi \\rangle$ ] where @xmath48 . indeed , for a suitably chosen model hamiltonian @xmath49 , the corresponding hf orbitals",
    "@xmath11 that minimize @xmath47 $ ] might not be well approximated by any set of one - electron ( ks ) orbitals @xmath10 that come from a common local potential @xmath39 .",
    "then , the latter condition , which is imposed on the orbitals @xmath10 in the oep minimization , would be so restrictive that the obtained ks - oep orbitals would differ significantly from the hf ones .",
    "thus , it seems that it is the specific form of the physical hamiltonian @xmath49 ( with coulombic interactions ) that actually makes the close representation of the hf orbitals with the ks ones possible .",

    "finally , it should be stressed that the presently obtained shell - resolved mapping between the hf orbital exchange potentials and the dft exact exchange potential is _ not _ related to the previously established step - like structure of the response part of the exchange potential .",
