    "experimental and theoretical studies of degenerate bose @xcite and fermi @xcite gases at ultra - low temperatures have become a vast research area .",
    "this field offers a unique testbed for the implementation of various ideas from classical and quantum nonlinear dynamics .",
    "in particular , experiments are possible in binary mixtures of atoms in two different hyperfine ( spin ) states .",
    "the mixtures were created by means of the sympathetic - cooling technique in the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) made of @xmath13rb atoms @xcite . in such a binary condensate , mutual interconversion ,",
    "i.e. , linear coupling between the two species , can be induced by means of a resonant ( spin - flipping ) electromagnetic wave , with a frequency in the ghz range @xcite .",
    "various effects were considered in this setting , including josephson oscillations between the two states josephson , domain walls between them @xcite ,  breathing - together \" oscillatory modes in the mixture @xcite , and nontopological vortices @xcite .    in a recent work @xcite ,",
    "a new effect was predicted , namely , transition to miscibility induced by the linear coupling between the immiscible components in a binary condensate . it was demonstrated that , essentially , it occurs as a transition from a state with the two components separated by a domain wall to a completely mixed one .",
    "quantitatively , the transition is characterized by an order parameter which determines the separation between centers of mass of the two components . with the increase of the linear - coupling strength ( coupling constant ) , the order parameter decreases , and the full mixing sets in when it vanishes .",
    "experimental observation of this effect is feasible due to the fact that the mixture of two hyperfine states in @xmath14rb is immiscible , but close to the miscibility threshold @xcite .",
    "the proximity of the mixture to the threshold can be additionally controlled by means of the feshbach resonance , which can be induced by an external magnetic field @xcite or optical pump @xcite .",
    "phase separation ( demixing ) due to the repulsion between two components was also investigated in boson - fermion mixtures @xcite , and , more recently , in a mixture of two fermion species @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "a situation is possible when the species are two different spin states of the same fermion atom ( as realized experimentally in @xmath15k k and @xmath16li @xcite ) , hence the linear interconversion between them can be induced by the properly tuned electromagnetic wave .    in a recent experimental work @xcite ,",
    "the population imbalance between two spin states (  polarization \" ) in a degenerate @xmath16li gas ( trapped in a cigar - shaped cavity ) was controlled by means of this technique .",
    "it was observed that , due to strong attraction between the different states ( induced by the feshbach resonance in external magnetic field ) they formed a fully mixed state in the central part of the trap , that was separated by two sharp boundaries from side domains , filled with the atoms representing a majority state ( see figs . 3 and 5 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "thus , it is relevant to consider the transition to mixing in the binary fermionic gas under the action of the linear coupling ( as well as in the bosonic mixture , the proximity to the miscibility point may be additionally controlled by means of the feshbach resonance , which affects the strength of the repulsion between the two species @xcite ) .",
    "this is the subject of the present work .",
    "rigorous description of the dynamics of the degenerate gas of fermions is based on the system of quantum - mechanical equations of motion for individual fermions ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which is difficult to handle if the gas contains many atoms .",
    "simplified approaches , of the mean - field - hydrodynamic ( mfhd ) type , were also elaborated for the description of quantum fermionic gases , in static @xcite and dynamical @xcite settings . in the latter case ,",
    "the approximation amounts to a single evolution equation for the fermion wave function , which formally resembles the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) for the boson gas @xcite , but features a different nonlinearity .",
    "this mfhd equation was successfully used to describe collapse @xcite and solitons @xcite in degenerate fermionic gases , and a system of nonlinearly coupled equations was employed to predict the phase separation in the binary gas with repulsion between the species @xcite .    in this work , we aim to investigate the onset of mixing in the immiscible binary fermion gas under the action of the extra linear coupling , in the ( effectively ) one - dimensional situation . in sec .",
    "ii , we formulate the model , and then elaborate an analytical approach to the problem , based on a variational approximation ( va ) .",
    "the latter provides a description of the binary mixture in terms of the number - of - atoms ratio in the two components , @xmath17 . in the presence of the linear mixing ,",
    "only the total number is conserved , @xmath6 , while the ratio @xmath18 , if different from zero , characterizes spontaneous breaking of symmetry between the components .",
    "in fact , @xmath19 is a specific , and most important , manifestation of the immiscibility in the fermionic system with the linear coupling ( in the usual setting , without the linear interconversion , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are conserved separately , which makes the situation altogether different ) .",
    "the va predicts the onset of mixing at a critical value of the coupling constant , @xmath20 , with @xmath8 at @xmath21 . the critical value is predicted as a a function of parameters measuring the total number of atoms and strength of the nonlinear repulsion between the species .",
    "comparison with numerical results demonstrates that va provides a qualitatively correct description of the transition to miscibility .",
    "basic numerical results are presented in sec .",
    "they demonstrate a drastic difference of the phase separation in the fermionic mixture from the immiscible binary bec : while in the boson gas the two species spontaneously separate and form a domain wall , with each component occupying the domain on either side of the wall ( both in the ordinary setting , without the linear coupling @xcite , and when the coupling is switched on , up to the onset of the induced mixing @xcite ) .",
    "a binary fermionic gas features the separation in an altogether different form : each component forms a spatially modulated symmetric ( even ) density wave , which are anti - locked , with the phase shift of @xmath2 between the components .",
    "a similar picture was predicted in the fermionic binary gas mixture without the linear coupling @xcite . here ,",
    "a major novelty is the above - mentioned overall spontaneous symmetry breaking between the components , manifested by @xmath22 ( in the immiscible bosonic condensate , the linear coupling does not break the equality between @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite ) . as @xmath0 approaches @xmath12 ( the mixed state ) , we observe @xmath23 , while the modulation depth in the density waves decreases .    in sec .",
    "iv , we briefly consider additional issues .",
    "one of them is the influence of asymmetry between the species , in the form of a chemical - potential difference between them , that can be induced by coupling of the atomic spin to external dc magnetic field .",
    "also considered is a dynamical relaxation of the binary gas into a mixed state , when @xmath0 is suddenly switched from zero to a value exceeding @xmath12 .",
    "the results are summarized in sec .",
    "v.    to conclude the introduction , it is relevant to mention that the relation between the imbalance in the spin population , induced by the linear coupling , and the spatial density - modulation waves developed by the two interacting species is similar to the known loff ( larkin - ovchinnikov - fulde - ferrell ) phase in a mixture of two fermion species with strongly differing values of the fermi radius .",
    "as shown in original works @xcite ( see also review @xcite ) , in that situation the pairing between the fermions belonging to the different species gives rise to cooper pairs with a nonzero momentum , which translates into spatial structures in the form of crystalline patterns of the gap parameter .",
    "the loff phase has various implications for quark matter @xcite , and a possibility of its realization in the mixture of two different spin states in an ultracold fermion gas , with the interaction between them controlled via the feshbach resonance , has been analyzed recently loffgas .",
    "our starting point is the system of nonlinearly coupled one - dimensional mfhd equations for the fermion wave functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 , as worked out in ref .",
    "@xcite , to which we add , following ref . @xcite and references therein , the linear - coupling terms with strength @xmath0 and , in the general case , a chemical - potential difference , @xmath26 ( in the larger part of the paper , we consider the symmetric system , with @xmath27 ) . in a scaled form ,",
    "the equations are : @xmath28here , we imply the normalization @xmath29 dx\\equiv n_{1}+n_{2}=2 .",
    "\\label{n}\\]]hence the total number of atoms is hidden in the positive self - repulsion parameter @xcite , @xmath30 , coefficient @xmath31 accounts for the nonlinear repulsion between the the species , and the strength of the trapping potential ( the coefficient in front of the parabolic potential , @xmath32 ) is scaled to be @xmath33 .",
    "the use of the same diagonal nonlinearity coefficient @xmath30 in both equations implies the same number of atoms in them , and , unless we introduce @xmath34 , the number of atoms will remain equal in both channels .",
    "a characteristic feature of the mfhdapproximation for the fermion gas is the power , @xmath35 , of the nonlinear self - repulsive terms ( recall the power is @xmath36 in the ordinary gpe ) .    in the particular case of @xmath37 , eqs .",
    "( [ phi ] ) and ( [ psi ] ) admit a different interpretation , being tantamount to a system of gpes for the binary bec @xcite , in which the self - interaction coefficient ( intra - species scattering length ) is set equal to zero by means of a feshbach - resonance adjustment .",

    "the simple va fails to predict this fact , allowing for the demixing at any @xmath101 .    besides the conspicuous error in predicting the slope of the @xmath103 dependence ,",

    "an essential inaccuracy of simple ansatz ( [ primitive ] ) is the assumption that the wave functions monotonically decrease with @xmath115 ; in reality , numerically found wave functions of the ground state have several local minima and maxima , see fig .",

    "as expected , the figure shows that the oscillations in the plots of @xmath150 and @xmath151 are greatly reduced , and , on the contrary to the symmetric model ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , there is no point at which these functions , @xmath157 and @xmath158 , would vanish ; instead , they decay asymptotically at large values of @xmath0 .",
    "the nonvanishing of @xmath159 implies that the numbers of atoms in the two components never become exactly equal at @xmath160 .    ,",

    "( phi ) and ( [ psi ] ) [ the stability of the solutions was verified within the framework of the full time - dependent mfhd equations , ( [ phi ] ) and ( [ psi ] ) ] . another aspect of the immiscibility / miscibility transition is relaxation of an initial immiscible state after the coupling terms were suddenly switched on . in the context of the boson mixture ,",
    "a similar problem was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that work",
    ", it was found that the sudden application of the strong linear coupling did not lead to relaxation of the system into a mixed state , but rather to persistent nonequilibrium oscillations . here , we performed numerical experiments , starting from the phase - separated state at @xmath81 and suddenly adding the linear coupling between the components , with @xmath21 ( in the symmetric system , with @xmath119 ) .",
    "the result can be adequately presented in the form of the time dependence of the immiscibility parameters , @xmath10 and @xmath132 , that were defined above [ see eqs .",
    "( [ nu0 ] ) and ( [ xi ] ) ] .",
    "a typical example of this dependence is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamical ] , which shows oscillatory relaxation to the mixed state characterized by @xmath162 .     and @xmath163 into a mixed state , after @xmath86 was suddenly switched on from @xmath164 to @xmath165 ( recall that @xmath166 for these values of @xmath124 and @xmath38 ) . ]",
    "we have demonstrated that the linear coupling between two different spin states ( induced by a resonant electromagnetic field ) , which form an immiscible binary fermionic gas , may enforce a transition to miscibility .",
    "the description of the degenerate gas is based on a system of equations for the wave functions of the two components , derived in the mfhd(mean - field - hydrodynamic ) approximation .",
    "the transition to the induced miscibility was predicted by means of the variational approximation , and then verified in numerical computations . in drastic contrast with the induced onset of miscibility in the bosonic mixture @xcite , in the present case the immiscible components do not form a domain wall , separately filling two domains partitioned by the wall .",
    "instead , they form a pair of anti - locked ( @xmath2-phase - shifted ) spatially modulated density waves , and spontaneously break the equality of numbers of atoms in the two components ( the latter feature was never observed in the bosonic mixture ) .",
    "the relation between the imbalance in the spin population , induced by the linear coupling , and the spatial density - wave patterns developed by the species is similar to the loff phase in a binary fermion gas with unequal values of the fermi radius @xcite-@xcite .",
    "as the linear - coupling strength , @xmath167 , approaches the induced - miscibility threshold , @xmath168 , the spatial modulation in the density waves vanishes , and the numbers of atoms in the components become equal .",
    "we have also considered the influence of inherent asymmetry between the components ( the chemical - potentialdifference between them ) , and dynamical situations , when @xmath0 is suddenly switched on ( in the symmetric system ) from zero to a value exceeding @xmath12 . in the latter case ,",
