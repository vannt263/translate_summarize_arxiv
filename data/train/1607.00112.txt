    "the chiral potts model was originally introduced @xcite to model the full phase diagram of krypton monolayers , including the epitaxial and incommensurate ordered phases . in addition to being useful in the analysis of surface layers , the chiral potts model has become an important model of phase transitions and critical phenomena .",
    "we have studied the chiral spin - glass potts system with @xmath0 states in @xmath1 and 3 spatial dimensions by renormalization - group theory and calculated the global phase diagrams in temperature , chirality concentration @xmath2 , and chirality - breaking concentration @xmath3 , also quantitatively determining phase chaos and phase - boundary chaos . in the @xmath9 ,",
    "the system has ferromagnetic , left - chiral , right - chiral , chiral spin - glass , and disordered phases .",
    "the phase boundaries to the ferromagnetic , left- and right - chiral phases show , differently , an unusual , fibrous patchwork ( microreentrances ) of all four ( ferromagnetic , left - chiral , right - chiral , chiral spin - glass ) ordered phases , especially in the multicritical region .",
    "the chaotic behavior of the interactions , under scale change , is determined in the chiral spin - glass phase and on the boundary between the chiral spin - glass and disordered phases , showing lyapunov exponents in magnitudes reversed from the usual ferromagnetic - antiferromagnetic spin - glass systems . at low temperatures , the boundaries of the left- and right - chiral phases become thresholded in @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in the @xmath1 ,",
    "the chiral spin - glass system does not have a spin - glass phase , consistently with the lower - critical dimension of ferromagnetic - antiferromagnetic spin glasses .",
    "the left- and right - chirally ordered phases show reentrance in chirality concentration @xmath2 .",
    "the chiral potts model is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath10,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 , at site @xmath12 the spin @xmath13 can be in @xmath14 different states with implicit periodic labeling , e.g. @xmath15 implying @xmath16 , the delta function @xmath17 for @xmath18 , and @xmath19 denotes summation over all nearest - neighbor pairs of sites .",
    "the upper and lower subscripts of @xmath20 give left - handed and right - handed chirality ( corresponding to heavy and superheavy domain walls in the krypton - on - graphite incommensurate ordering @xcite ) , whereas @xmath21 gives the non - chiral potts model ( relevant to the krypton - on - graphite epitaxial ordering @xcite ) .    in the chiral potts spin - glass model studied here ,",
    "the chirality of each nearest - neighbor interaction is randomly either left - handed , or right - handed , or zero .",
    "this randomness is frozen ( quenched ) into the system and the overall fraction of left- , right- , and non - chirality is controlled by the quenched densities @xmath2 and @xmath3 as described below .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian of the chiral potts spin - glass model is @xmath22,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where , for each pair of nearest - neighbor sites @xmath23 @xmath24 ( non - chiral ) or 1 ( chiral ) . in the latter case , @xmath25 ( left - handed ) or 0 ( right - handed ) .",
    "thus , non - chiral , left - chiral , and right - chiral nearest - neighbor interactions are frozen randomly distributed in the entire system . for the entire system ,",
    "the overall concentration of chiral interactions is given by @xmath2 , with @xmath26 . among the chiral interactions ,",
    "the overall concentrations of left- and right - chiral interactions are respectively given by @xmath3 and @xmath27 , with @xmath28 .",
    "thus , the model is chiral for @xmath29 and chiral - symmetric @xmath6 , chiral - symmetry broken for @xmath30 .",
    "the global phase diagram is given in terms of temperature @xmath5 , chirality concentration @xmath2 , and chirality - breaking concentration @xmath3 .",

    "we solve the chiral potts spin - glass model with @xmath0 states by renormalization - group theory , in @xmath34 spatial dimension and with the length rescaling factor @xmath35 .",
    "our solution is , simultaneously , the migdal - kadanoff approximation @xcite for the cubic lattice and exact @xcite for the @xmath34 hierarchical lattice based on the leftmost graph of fig .",

    "the local renormalization - group transformation is achieved by a sequence , shown in fig . 1 , of decimations @xmath44 where @xmath45 , etc . , and @xmath46 is the subtractive constant mentioned in the previous section , and bond movings @xmath47 where primes mark the interactions of the renormalized system .",
    "the starting trimodal quenched probability distribution of the interactions , characterized by @xmath2 and @xmath3 as described above , is not conserved under rescaling .",

    "exact calculations on hierarchical lattices @xcite are also currently widely used on a variety of statistical mechanics problems @xcite .    for numerical practicality , the bond moving of eq .",
    "( 5 ) is achieved by two sequential pairwise combination of interactions , each pairwise combination leading to an intermediate probability distribution resulting from a pairwise convolution as in eq.(6 ) .",
    "furthermore , due to our convention of zeroing the largest interaction constant in each local triplet of interactions , the quenched probability distribution of three interactions @xmath51 is conveniently just composed of the three probability distributions of two interactions , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 has the ( largest ) interaction @xmath54 etc . , which also considerably simplifies the numerical calculation .",
    "we effect this procedure numerically , by representing each probability distribution by histograms , as in previous studies @xcite .",
    "the probability distributions of two interactions @xmath53 , @xmath42 , and @xmath55 are represented via bivariate histograms with two - dimensional vectors @xmath56 for @xmath57 , etc .",
    "the number of histograms grow rapidly with each renormalization - group transformation , so that for calculational purposes , the histograms are binned when the number of histograms outgrow @xmath58 bins . in the calculation of chiral spin - glass phase - sink fixed distribution of fig . 5",
    ", the histograms are binned after @xmath59 histograms .",
    "the different thermodynamic phases of the model are identified by the different asymptotic renormalization - group flows of the quenched probability distribution . for all renormalization - group flows ,",
    "originating inside the phases and on the phase boundaries , eq.(6 ) is iterated until asymptotic behavior is reached .",
    "thus , we are able to calculate the global phase diagram of the chiral potts spin - glass model .",
    "the calculated global phase diagram of the @xmath34 chiral potts spin - glass system , in temperature @xmath5 , chirality concentration @xmath2 , and chirality - breaking concentration @xmath3 , is given in fig .",
    "the ferromagnetically ordered ( f ) phase occurs at low temperature and low chirality @xmath2 .",
    "the chiral spin - glass ordered ( s ) phase occurs at intermediate chirality @xmath2 for all @xmath3 and at high chirality @xmath2 for intermediate @xmath3 . the left- and right - chirally ordered phases l and r occur at high chirality @xmath2 and values of chirality - breaking @xmath3 away from 0.5 .",
    "the disordered phase ( d ) occurs at high temperature .",
    "the global phase diagram is mirror - symmetric with respect to the chirality - breaking concentration @xmath6 , so that only @xmath60 is shown in fig .",
    "1 . in the ( not shown ) mirror - symmetric @xmath8 portion of the global phase diagram , the right - chirally",
    "ordered phase ( r ) occurs in the place of the left - chirally ordered phase ( l ) seen in fig .",
    "different cross - sections of the global phase diagram are shown in in figs . 3 and 4 .",
    "under renormalization - group transformations , all points in the spin - glass phase are attracted to a fixed probability distribution of the quenched random interactions @xmath61 , namely to the sink of the chiral spin - glass phase . as explained in sec .",
    "iii , @xmath61 is composed of three distributions , @xmath53 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 . of these , @xmath53 gives the quenched probability distribution of nearest - neighbor interactions in which the ferromagnetic interaction @xmath62 is dominant .",
    "similarly , @xmath42 and @xmath43 give the quenched probability distributions of nearest - neighbor interactions in which , respectively , the left - chiral interaction @xmath63 and the right - chiral interaction @xmath64 are dominant .",
    "( as explained in sec .",
    "ii , by subtraction of an overall constant , the dominant interaction is set to zero and the other two , subdominant interactions are therefore negative , with no loss of generality . )",
    "the sink fixed distribution for @xmath53 is given in fig . 5 , where the average interactions @xmath37 diverge to negative infinity as @xmath65 , where @xmath39 is the number of renormalization - group iterations and @xmath40 is the runaway exponent , while conserving the shape of the distribution shown in fig .",
    "5 . the other two distribution @xmath42 and @xmath43 have the same sink distribution .",
    "thus , in the chiral spin - glass phase , chiral symmetry is broken by local order , but not globally .     and the average interaction diverges as @xmath66 , where @xmath39 is the number of renormalization - group iterations and @xmath40 is the runaway exponent .",
    "top panel : at the phase boundary between the chiral spin - glass and disordered phases .",
    "the corresponding lyapunov exponent is @xmath67 and the average non - zero interaction is fixed at @xmath68 .",
    "the relative value of the lyapunov exponents is unusual for spin - glass systems . ]    in spin - glass phases , at a specific location in the lattice , the consecutive interactions , encountered under consecutive renormalization - group transformations , behave chaotically @xcite .",
    "this chaotic behavior was found @xcite and subsequently well established @xcite in spin - glass systems with competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "we find here that the chaotic rescaling behavior also occurs in our current spin - glass system with competing left- and right - chiral interactions , as shown in fig .",
    "in fact , the chaotic rescaling behavior occurs not only within the spin - glass phase , but also , quantitatively distinctly , at the phase boundary between the spin - glass and disordered phases @xcite .",
    "this chaotic behavior at the phase boundary is also seen in the chiral system here and also shown in fig .",
    "it has been shown that chaos in the interaction as a function of rescaling implies chaos in the spin - spin correlation function as a function of distance @xcite .",
    "chaos in the spin - glass phase and at its phase boundary are identified and distinguished by different lyapunov exponents @xcite .",
    "we have calculated the lyapunov exponent @xcite @xmath69 where @xmath70 at step @xmath71 of the renormalization - group trajectory .",
    "the sum in eq.(7 ) is to be taken within the asymptotic chaotic band , which is renormalization - group stable or unstable for the phase or its boundary , respectively .",
    "thus , we throw out the first 100 renormalization - group iterations to eliminate the transient points outside of , but leading to the chaotic band . subsequently , typically using 1,000 renormalization - group iterations in the sum in eq.(7 )",
    "assures the convergence of the lyapunov exponent value .",
    "we have calculated the lyapunov exponents @xmath72 and 1.94 respectively for the chiral spin - glass phase and for the boundary between the chiral spin - glass and disordered phases . at the chiral spin - glass phase - sink fixed distribution",
    ", the average interaction diverges to negative infinity as @xmath73 , where @xmath39 is the number of renormalization - group iterations and @xmath40 is the runaway exponent . at the fixed distribution of the phase boundary between the chiral spin - glass and disordered phases ,",
    "the average interaction remains fixed at @xmath74 .",
    "interestingly , chaos is stronger at the boundary ( larger lyapunov exponent ) than inside the chiral spin - glass phase .",
    "the opposite is seen in the usually studied @xmath75 ferromagnetic - antiferromagnetic spin glass @xcite .    by contrast , in each of the ferromagnetic ( f ) , left - chiral ( l ) , and right - chiral ( r ) ordered phases , under consecutive renormalization - group transformations , the quenched probability distribution of the interactions sharpens to a delta function around a single value receding to negative infinity , for the respective pairs of interactions , namely ( @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "there is no asymptotic chaotic behavior under renormalization - group in these phases f , l , and r.        cross - sections of the global phase diagram , in temperature @xmath5 and chirality concentration @xmath2 , are given in fig .",
    "the chirality - breaking concentration @xmath3 is indicated for each cross - section .",
    "note that , as soon as the chiral symmetry of the model is broken by @xmath78 , a narrow fibrous patchwork ( microreentrances ) of all four ( ferromagnetic , left - chiral , right - chiral , chiral spin - glass ) ordered phases intervenes at the boundaries between the ferromagnetically ordered phase f and the spin - glass phase s or the disordered phase d. this intervening region is more pronounced close to the multicritical region where the ferromagnetic , spin - glass , and disordered phases meet .",
    "the interlacing phase transitions inside this region are more clearly seen in the right - hand side panels of fig .",
    "3 , where only the phase boundaries are drawn in black . this intervening region gains importance as @xmath3 moves away from 0.5 .",
    "but it is only at higher values of the chirality - breaking concentration @xmath3 , such as @xmath79 on the figure , that the chirally ordered phase appears as a compact region at @xmath80 . in this case , again all four ( ferromagnetic , left - chiral , right - chiral , chiral spin - glass ) ordered phases intervene in a narrow fibrous patchwork at the boundaries of the chirally ordered phases l and r , the latter mirror symmetric and not shown here . for @xmath81 ,",
    "for which all interactions of the system are , with respective concentrations @xmath82 and @xmath2 , either ferromagnetic , or left - chiral , the phase diagram becomes symmetric with respect to @xmath83 as in standard ferromagnetic - antiferromagnetic spin - glass systems @xcite , except that the chirally ordered phases dominate the fibrous patchwork on both sides of the phase diagram .",
    "cross - sections , in chirality concentration @xmath2 and chirality - breaking concentration @xmath3 , of the global phase diagram are given in fig .",
    "4 . the temperature @xmath5 is given on each cross - section . note the narrow fibrous patches of all four ( ferromagnetic , left - chiral , right - chiral , chiral spin - glass ) phases intervening at the boundaries of the ferromagnetically ordered phase f and at the boundaries of the chirally ordered phases l and r. it is seen here that , within these regions , the chirally ordered phases l and r form elongated lamellar patterns .",
    "the interlacing phase transitions inside this region are more clearly seen in the right - hand side panels of the figure , where only the phase boundaries are drawn in black .",
    "it is again seen that the symmetry around @xmath83 at the upper horizontal frame @xmath84 of each panel is broken inside the panel @xmath85 .",
    "also note the temperature - independent square shape , at low temperatures , of the phase boundary of the chirally ordered phases l and r , creating the threshold value of @xmath86 and @xmath87 or 0.16 into l or r , respectively .",
    "this is also visible in the three - dimensional fig . 1 .",
    "the global phase diagram of the @xmath1 chiral potts spin - glass system is given in fig .",
    "representative cross - sections in temperature @xmath5 and chirality concentration @xmath2 are shown .",
    "the chirality - breaking concentration @xmath3 is given on each cross - section .",
    "the ferromagnetically ordered phase ( f ) , the left - chirally ordered phase ( l ) , and the disordered phase ( d ) are marked .",
    "no chiral spin - glass phase occurs in @xmath1 and no fibrous patchwork is seen at the phase boundaries .",
    "the chirally ordered phase appears for very high chirality - breaking concentration @xmath3 ( seen here for @xmath88 , but not seen for @xmath89 ) and shows reentrance @xcite in chirality concentration @xmath2 .",
    "this reentrance disappears as @xmath90 is approached . for @xmath81 ,",
    "for which all interactions of the system are , with respective concentrations @xmath82 and @xmath2 , either ferromagnetic , or left - chiral , the phase diagram becomes symmetric with respect to @xmath83 as in standard ferromagnetic - antiferromagnetic spin - glass systems @xcite .",
    "the absence of the chiral spin - glass phase in @xmath36 is consistent with standard ferromagnetic - antiferromagnetic ising spin - glass systems , where the lower - critical dimension for the spin - glass phase is found around 2.5 @xcite . below this dimension ,",
    "no spin - glass phase appears ( unless some nano - restructuring is done to the system @xcite ) .",
    "we have thus obtained the global phase diagram of the chiral spin - glass potts system with @xmath0 states in @xmath34 and 2 spatial dimensions by renormalization - group theory that is approximate for the cubic lattice and exact for the hierarchical lattice .",

    "quite unusually , the phase boundary between the chiral spin - glass and disordered phases is more chaotic than the chiral spin - glass phase itself , as judged by the magnitudes of the respective lyapunov exponents . at low temperatures ,",

    "<S> the chiral spin - glass potts system with @xmath0 states is studied in @xmath1 and 3 spatial dimensions by renormalization - group theory and the global phase diagrams are calculated in temperature , chirality concentration @xmath2 , and chirality - breaking concentration @xmath3 , with determination of phase chaos and phase - boundary chaos . in the @xmath4 , </S>",
    "<S> the system has ferromagnetic , left - chiral , right - chiral , chiral spin - glass , and disordered phases . </S>",
    "<S> the phase boundaries to the ferromagnetic , left- and right - chiral phases show , differently , an unusual , fibrous patchwork ( microreentrances ) of all four ( ferromagnetic , left - chiral , right - chiral , chiral spin - glass ) ordered ordered phases , especially in the multicritical region . </S>",
    "<S> the chaotic behavior of the interactions , under scale change , are determined in the chiral spin - glass phase and on the boundary between the chiral spin - glass and disordered phases , showing lyapunov exponents in magnitudes reversed from the usual ferromagnetic - antiferromagnetic spin - glass systems . at low temperatures , </S>",
    "<S> the boundaries of the left- and right - chiral phases become thresholded in @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in the @xmath1 , </S>",
