    "fractional level wess - zumino - witten models were posited long ago as a tool to construct the non - unitary minimal models .",
    "their introduction was facilitated by the discovery of kac and wakimoto @xcite of a class of irreducible representations of affine algebras whose ( normalised ) characters carry a representation of the modular group @xmath2 .",
    "these so - called admissible representations include , but are not limited to , the integrable representations from which the rational wess - zumino - witten models are constructed .",
    "the integrable representations necessarily have non - negative integer levels , so the fractional level models must be constructed from non - integrable admissible representations .",
    "whereas the rational models have a well - known geometric description as non - linear sigma models on compact ( simple ) group manifolds @xcite , this can not be generalised to fractional level models .",
    "indeed , the action defining such a sigma model is ambiguous unless the level is an integer @xcite .",
    "of course an action is not a prerequisite for constructing a conformal field theory , especially a non - unitary one , and one can proceed in a purely algebraic manner from the representation theory of the appropriate affine algebra .    at each level",
    "there are only finitely many admissible representations .",
    "indeed , this number is almost always zero , and levels for which this is not the case are sometimes referred to as being admissible themselves .",
    "this finiteness property led to the conjecture that such algebraically - defined fractional level wess - zumino - witten models were also rational conformal field theories .",
    "indeed , the characters of the admissible representations close under the modular group action and this action is unitary , as in the integer level case .",
    "however , it was quickly realised that the verlinde formula , which relates the fusion coefficients of the theory to the modular @xmath3-matrix @xcite , gives negative fusion coefficients in general @xcite .",
    "moreover , the matrix representing conjugation , @xmath4 , was also observed to contain negative entries .",
    "even worse , subsequent investigations determining the fusion rules from the decoupling of the null vectors of the representations ( in correlation functions ) gave different results @xcite . whilst there have been some proposals for how to interpret these negative coefficients @xcite , this resulted in a general feeling that the fractional level models suffered from an `` intrinsic sickness '' @xcite and that only their coset theories were well - defined .",
    "all of these efforts were hampered by the seemingly natural assumption that the fusion of admissible modules decomposed into direct sums of admissible modules .",
    "this was pointed out by gaberdiel @xcite , who studied the `` smallest '' fractional level model corresponding to the affine algebra @xmath5 at level @xmath6 ( smallest in the sense of having the minimal number of admissible representations ) . using a purely algebraic algorithm to compute the fusion rules of the admissible representations @xcite , rather than the verlinde formula or correlation functions",
    ", he was able to show that fusing admissible representations sometimes resulted in reducible but indecomposable representations of the type found in logarithmic conformal field theory .",
    "furthermore , he also gave strong evidence that these fusions sometimes produced representations for which the conformal dimensions of the states were _ not _ bounded below .",
    "this may seem like a textbook definition of `` intrinsic sickness '' , but there is a very natural way to understand these unbounded - below representations .",
    "the fusion rules of the rational wess - zumino - witten models respect , in a natural way , the automorphisms of the underlying affine algebra .",
    "it is therefore natural to expect that the fusion rules of the fractional level models will too , and explicit computations completely support this expectation ( however , we mention that no proof of this property has yet been advanced ) . whereas these automorphisms transform integrable representations into one another , the same is not true for the admissible representations .",
    "there , one finds that the infinite group of affine algebra automorphisms leads to an infinite number of distinct transformed representations , only a finite number of which have conformal dimensions which are bounded below .",
    "this ruins the hope that fractional level wess - zumino - witten models would be rational conformal field theories , but in a manner which is easy to control .",
    "the inherent irrationality seems to be restricted to these automorphic copies ( in modern parlance , the images under _ spectral flow _ ) of the admissible representations .",
    "of course , there is still the realisation that these models are logarithmic  work on understanding the nature of the indecomposable representations that arise in these models is still in its infancy .",
    "nevertheless , this provides a convenient handle with which one can try to understand the true nature of fractional level models .",
    "it is no longer appropriate to regard these models as poorly - defined curiosities .",
    "rather , it is natural to regard these models as fundamental building blocks for irrational and logarithmic conformal field theories , much as their integer level cousins are for rational theories .    with this in mind",
    ", another fractional level model was studied in @xcite , @xmath5 at level @xmath7 .",
    "this model is particularly interesting to field theorists as it has been known for some time ( see @xcite for a statement to this effect ) that the @xmath1 system of ghost fields exhibits the same symmetry . in other words ,",
    "this fractional level model is equivalent to a free field theory .",
    "somewhat perversely , the authors of @xcite did not analyse @xmath0 using this equivalence , but instead realised it in terms of a different ghost system and a lorentzian boson .",
    "the advantage of this approach was that they were also able to divine the existence of unbounded - below representations in terms of `` multiple - twist '' fields , albeit at a formidable computation cost .",
    "more interestingly , the theory they explored was not logarithmic , in contrast to the @xmath8 theory of @xcite .    in this note , we revisit the construction of the @xmath0 conformal field theory .",
    "our aim is threefold .",
    "first , we emphasise that this theory is in fact extremely easy to analyse if one abandons free - field constructions .",
    "we do so here in an expository fashion which makes it clear how to generalise to other admissible levels .",
    "indeed , @xmath9 is the first of an infinite series of admissible levels @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) which give rise to non - logarithmic conformal field theories .",
    "we expect that all other admissible levels give rise to logarithmic theories .",
    "our second aim is to make precise the relation between the algebra @xmath0 and the ghost algebra considered in @xcite .",
    "this provides an excellent example of the extended algebra formalism of @xcite , in which all the subtleties uncovered there are present .",
    "our last aim is to point out that there is nothing mysterious or `` sick '' about the modular properties of this theory .",
    "the partition functions , conjugation matrices and verlinde formula all work _ exactly _ as expected .",
    "the organisation is as follows .",
    "after first introducing our notations and conventions ( section  [ secalg ] ) , we derive the structure of the irreducible vacuum module in section  [ secvacmod ] .",
    "it is worthwhile seeing explicitly in at least one case that admissibility just means that the corresponding verma module has the same `` braided '' singular vector structure as the integrable modules .",
    "this gives us the `` null - vector constraints '' on the other representations of the theory , thence the other admissible highest weight modules ( section  [ secadmiss ] ) .",
    "character formulae for all these are derived .",
    "we then proceed to the computation of the fusion rules of the theory ( section  [ secfusion ] ) .",
    "this involves considering the purely algebraic algorithm of nahm @xcite and gaberdiel - kausch @xcite . whilst this algorithm is computationally intensive",
    ", we note that by making two very plausible assumptions , we do not actually have to perform any computations and can proceed using only logical consequences of the algorithm .",
    "first , we assume that the irreducible vacuum module acts as the fusion identity .",
    "we could of course prove this easily using the fusion algorithm , but prefer to note that this assumption is consistent unless we uncover a logarithmic partner state to the vacuum ( which we do not ) .",
    "logic alone then allows us to compute the fusion rules of the admissible modules .",
    "in particular , we prove that certain fusions of admissible modules lead to modules whose conformal dimensions are unbounded below .",
    "the second assumption then allows us to identify these modules .",
    "this is the assumption that the fusion rules respect the _ spectral flow _",
    "automorphisms of @xmath5 .",
    "this then gives us a complete infinite spectrum of irreducible modules which closes under fusion . in section  [ secchar ] , we determine the full set of characters of the theory , noting that they are not all independent as one might expect from rational theories . instead , there are only four linearly independent characters .",
    "we argue , following @xcite , that a module is determined by its character _ and _ a prescription of how to expand it .",
    "the latter is implicit in rational theories , but the presence of unbounded - below modules ( and non - integrable modules in general ) forces its explicit acknowledgement here .",
    "the consequent lack of a bijection between the modules and the characters therefore leads us to introduce a grothendieck ring of characters .",
    "sections  [ secghost ]  [ secghostreps ] are devoted to a detailed study of the extended algebra of the @xmath0 algebra , which is the @xmath1 ghost system . in section  [ secghost ] , we show that the ( chiral ) primary fields defining this extension can not be taken to be mutually bosonic with the affine currents , and that associativity of the operator product algebra forces the introduction of an additional operator into the theory .",
    "the bosonic ghost fields are defined , but they are not mutually bosonic with respect to the affine currents either . at issue here is the definition of the adjoint , an integral part of any symmetry algebra . in section  [ secghost2 ] ,",
    "we change the adjoint and repeat the analysis of the previous section finding satisfying simplifications  all fields are mutually bosonic and the operator product algebra is associative without need of additional operators .    we then briefly discuss ( section  [ secghostreps ] ) the representation theory of this extended algebra , remarking upon the consistency of the monodromy charge and the lifted extended algebra spectral flow .",
    "the verma modules of the extended algebra are verified to be irreducible  in this sense the @xmath1 ghost system may be said to be free  and fermionic character formulae for them and their @xmath0 counterparts are derived .",
    "these formulae give simple expressions for the string functions of all the modules of the theory .",
    "finally , we conclude by reconsidering the modular properties of the @xmath0 theory in section  [ secmod ] . we derive the @xmath3 and @xmath12-matrices of the theory ,",
    "verify that they are symmetric and unitary , and write down a complete set of modular invariants .",
    "moreover , we check that @xmath4 represents conjugation and the verlinde formula recovers the fusion coefficients in the grothendieck ring of characters .",
    "there are also two appendices , the second of which ( appendix  [ apptheta ] ) is just a summary of our notations and conventions for jacobi theta functions .",
    "the first , appendix  [ appspecflow ] , gives a detailed description of the spectral flow automorphisms as affine weyl group translations ( by elements of the coroot lattice ) and affine outer automorphisms ( as translations by elements of the dual root lattice ) .",
    "we are not aware of a comprehensive discussion of this viewpoint in the literature , so we hope that this will be of independent use in the future .",
    "let @xmath13 be the complex lie algebra spanned by three generators @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 subject to the commutation relations @xmath17 } = 2 e , \\qquad { \\bigl [ e , f \\bigr ] } = h \\qquad \\text{and } \\qquad { \\bigl [ h , f \\bigr ] } = -2 f.\\ ] ] we define the killing form to be the trace of the product in the defining ( fundamental ) two - dimensional representation ( equivalently , @xmath18 of the trace of the product in the adjoint representation ) .",
    "this gives @xmath19 with all other combinations vanishing .",
    "the affine kac - moody algebra @xmath5 is then the vector space @xmath20 } \\oplus \\operatorname{span}_{{\\mathbb{c } } } { \\left\\ { k , l_0 \\right\\}}\\ ] ] equipped with the commutation relations    [ eqncommrels ] @xmath21 } = { \\bigl [ j^a , j^b \\bigr]}_{m+n } + m { \\kappa \\bigl ( j^a , j^b \\bigr ) } \\delta_{m+n,0 } k , \\qquad { \\bigl [ j^a_m , k \\bigr ] } = 0 , \\\\ { \\bigl [ l_0 , j^a_m \\bigr ] } = -m j^a_m \\qquad \\text{and } \\qquad { \\bigl [ l_0 , k \\bigr ] } = 0.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath22 denotes @xmath23 , where @xmath24 can represent @xmath15 , @xmath14 or @xmath16 .",
    "we are generally interested in representations of @xmath5 on which the central element @xmath25 acts as @xmath26 times the identity , for some common scalar @xmath26 called the level . in what follows",
    ", we will be principally interested in the case where @xmath9 .",
    "as is well known , the universal enveloping algebra of @xmath5 contains a subalgebra isomorphic to the ( universal enveloping algebra of the ) virasoro algebra ( when @xmath27 ) .",
    "this is the sugawara construction . here",
    ", the virasoro elements are realised as quadratic elements normally ordered in the standard way : @xmath28 as usual , we will identify @xmath29 with the quadratic element @xmath30 constructed in equation  ( [ eqndefvir ] ) . the central charge defined by the sugawara construction",
    "is @xmath31 .",
    "we define a triangular decomposition of @xmath5 as follows : the span of @xmath32 , @xmath25 and @xmath30 defines the cartan subalgebra , the raising operators are @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath36 , and the adjoint is defined by @xmath37 we can now talk about highest weight states and verma modules .",
    "it is easy to check from equation  ( [ eqndefvir ] ) that an affine highest weight state with @xmath13-weight ( @xmath32-eigenvalue ) @xmath38 has conformal dimension ( @xmath30-eigenvalue ) @xmath39 the @xmath13-weight @xmath38 , conformal dimension @xmath40 and the level @xmath26 completely determine an @xmath5-weight @xmath41 .",
    "as the level is given and the conformal dimension of a highest weight state is determined by its @xmath13-weight , it follows that an @xmath5-verma module is characterised solely by the latter .",
    "we therefore denote verma modules by @xmath42 .",
    "the fundamental question to ask about verma modules concerns their reducibility . if a verma module contains a proper submodule , then this submodule is generated by singular vectors , non - trivial descendant highest weight states .",
    "quotienting @xmath42 by its maximal proper submodule gives the corresponding irreducible module @xmath43 .",
    "to find singular vectors , we can use the fact that verma modules come equipped with a unique ( up to normalisation ) invariant inner product defined by the adjoint ( [ eqndefadj ] ) , the shapovalov form .",
    "with respect to this form , the ( non - trivial ) singular vectors and their descendants are all null , meaning that their norm is zero .",
    "the presence of such null states can be detected by computing the determinant of the shapovalov form in each affine weight space .",
    "happily , there is an explicit form for this determinant , given by the kac - kazhdan formula @xcite : the shapovalov determinant of @xmath42 in the weight space @xmath44 is @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the multiplicity with which the weight @xmath47 appears in the module @xmath48 ( this is independent of @xmath26 ) .",
    "the presence of a singular vector in @xmath42 is signalled by the vanishing of one of the factors appearing in this formula and the vanishing of the arguments of the function @xmath49 occurring in the corresponding exponent ( non - vanishing arguments of this @xmath49 in general correspond to descendants of the singular vector ) .",
    "we will refer to weights which admit a singular vector as singular weights .",
    "we now specialise to @xmath9 , with the aim of constructing a conformal field theory .",
    "this theory will therefore have central charge @xmath50 .",
    "the first step is to determine a vacuum module . by definition ,",
    "the vacuum @xmath51 is an @xmath5-highest weight state which is also annihilated by all the zero - modes , in particular by @xmath32 and @xmath52 .",
    "the vacuum module is therefore a quotient module of @xmath48 .",
    "we can analyse these quotients by determining the singular vector structure of the verma module , and to do this we use the kac - kazhdan formula ( [ eqnkackazhdan ] ) .    setting @xmath53 in this formula",
    ", we see that the determinant vanishes when @xmath54 in the first case , the arguments of @xmath49 in the corresponding exponent vanish if @xmath55 and @xmath56 , indicating that the singular vector has weight @xmath57 .",
    "this is clearly the singular vector @xmath58 which is set to zero by definition .",
    "the other two cases are more interesting and the weights of the corresponding singular vectors are found to be @xmath59 respectively .",
    "the first few singular weights are therefore @xmath60 these weights do not determine the singular vector itself , but it can be shown that every weight space of a verma module admits at most one singular vector .",
    "unfortunately , these are not the only singular weights of @xmath48 .",
    "we also have to check for singular vectors which are descended from those we have already found .",
    "in other words , we should check the submodules which the known singular vectors generate for further singular vectors . repeating the above kac - kazhdan analysis for the submodule generated by the singular weight @xmath57",
    ", we find further singular weights of the form @xmath61 these describe two series of singular vectors which are completely disjoint from those found above .",
    "the first few weights are @xmath62    however , the weight @xmath57 and those given in ( [ eqnsw1 ] ) and ( [ eqnsw2 ] ) exhaust the singular weights of @xmath48 .",
    "this is not hard to check explicitly : for example , the singular weights descended from that of weight @xmath63 of ( [ eqnsw1 ] ) all have the form @xmath64 which are both of the form given in ( [ eqnsw2 ] ) .",
    "it follows now that the singular vector structure of @xmath48 is as shown in figure  [ figvacvermod ] .",
    "note the braiding pattern familiar from the integrable modules ( and the virasoro algebra ) .",
    "[ ] [ ] @xmath65 [ ] [ ] @xmath66 [ ] [ ] @xmath67 [ ] [ ] @xmath68 [ ] [ ] @xmath69 [ ] [ ] @xmath70 [ ] [ ] @xmath71 [ ] [ ] @xmath72 [ ] [ ] @xmath73 [ ] [ ] @xmath74 [ ] [ ] @xmath75 [ ] [ ] @xmath76 [ ] [ ] @xmath77 [ ] [ ] @xmath78    .",
    "each singular vector is labelled by its @xmath13-weight and conformal dimension ( respectively).,width=491 ]    it follows that the descendant singular vectors of @xmath48 are generated by the two singular vectors of weights @xmath57 and @xmath79 .",
    "the former is the vector @xmath58 which we have already set to zero , so we see that there are only two possible choices for the vacuum module .",
    "either we set the dimension @xmath80 singular vector to zero , or we do not .",
    "we choose to set this singular vector to zero , thereby taking the vacuum module to be the irreducible quotient @xmath81 .",
    "the alternative , in which this singular vector is not set to zero , will undoubtedly lead to a logarithmic conformal field theory @xcite ( assuming it can be defined ) , which we do not want to consider here symmetry was proposed in @xcite , based on free field constructions .",
    "we do not expect that keeping the singular vector in the vacuum module will lead to this theory .",
    "we intend to return to a detailed discussion of how the theory discussed here can be extended to something similar to that of @xcite in a future publication . ] .",
    "the character for the vacuum verma module is easily computed from the standard poincar - birkhoff - witt basis and has the form @xmath82 where we have used jacobi s triple product identity , equation  ( [ eqnjacobitriple ] ) , in the last step .",
    "it now follows from the embedding pattern of figure  [ figvacvermod ] that the character of the ( irreducible ) vacuum module takes the form @xmath83 } { { \\chi_{{{\\widehat{\\mathcal{v}}}_{0 } } } \\left ( z ; q \\right ) } } \\notag \\\\ & = \\frac{\\displaystyle \\sum_{n \\in { \\mathbb{z } } } { \\left ( z^{-6n } - z^{6n-2 } \\right ) } q^{2n { \\left ( 3n-1 \\right)}}}{\\displaystyle \\prod_{i=1}^{\\infty } { \\left ( 1 - z^{-2 } q^{i-1 } \\right ) } { \\left ( 1 - q^i \\right ) } { \\left ( 1 - z^2 q^i \\right ) } } = \\frac{\\displaystyle \\sum_{n \\in { \\mathbb{z } } } { \\left ( z^{-6n } - z^{6n-2 } \\right ) } q^{2n { \\left ( 3n-1 \\right)}}}{\\displaystyle \\sum_{n \\in { \\mathbb{z } } } { \\left ( -1 \\right)}^n z^{2n } q^{n { \\left ( n+1 \\right ) } / 2}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "now that we have a vacuum module , we can ask if it constrains the spectrum of the theory . since the vacuum module has a vanishing singular vector at @xmath13-weight @xmath80 and grade @xmath80 ,",
    "the answer is `` yes '' ( setting @xmath58 to zero does not affect the spectrum as it is a part of the definition of the vacuum ) . to derive the constraints ,",
    "we need the explicit form of this singular vector .",
    "there exist semi - explicit formulae for such singular vectors in the literature @xcite , but it is not hard to compute it directly in this case .",
    "it turns out to be @xmath84 up to normalisation . by the state - field correspondence of conformal field theory",
    ", this vanishing singular vector gives rise to a vanishing chiral field whose modes must therefore annihilate any physical state @xcite .",
    "these are the constraints we seek .    instead of considering this singular vector itself",
    ", it is convenient to consider its @xmath13-weight @xmath85 descendant obtained by acting with @xmath86 .",
    "this descendant field is ( up to normalisation ) @xmath87 let @xmath88 be a highest weight state with @xmath13-weight @xmath38 . since the modes of @xmath89 must annihilate any physical state , @xmath90 implying that @xmath91 .",
    "these are the only allowed highest weight states of the theory .",
    "their conformal dimensions are @xmath85 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "now that we know the possible highest weight states , we can ask about the possible highest weight modules . for example , repeating the analysis of section  [ secvacmod ] shows that the verma module @xmath94 has singular vectors of weights @xmath95 , @xmath96 the embedding pattern is again of braided type and the two generating singular vectors are those with weights @xmath97 the @xmath13-weights of these singular vectors do not belong to the allowed set , hence we can conclude that all descendant singular vectors vanish in the physical module .",
    "it follows that the highest weight state with @xmath98 generates the irreducible module @xmath99 .",
    "its character is @xmath100 similarly , one finds that the modules corresponding to @xmath101 and @xmath102 are also irreducible with characters @xmath103 respectively .",

    "we turn now to the derivation of the fusion rules of the admissible modules . normally , we could investigate this by computing @xmath104-point correlation functions of the primary fields .",

    "however , if subsequent fusion computations revealed that the vacuum had a logarithmic partner state , then it would follow from general principles @xcite that the conjugate field to the identity would be this logarithmic partner ( and the @xmath105-point function of the identity would vanish identically ) , contradicting our original declaration .    for this reason , we will be careful and compute fusion using a purely algebraic method that makes no reference to correlation functions nor non - degeneracy .",

    "the working space is then reduced by removing the so - called _ spurious states _ which reflect the vanishing of certain singular vectors of @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "this is achieved by employing three master equations ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.22.4 ) iteratively on expressions formed from these singular vectors .",
    "the fusion representation space is thereby constructed ( to grade @xmath110 ) when all spurious states are removed .",
    "the master equations then define the action of the symmetry algebra ( that is @xmath106 ) upon what remains .",
    "it is extremely important to note that we need to assume that the conformal dimensions of the states composing each module are bounded from below .",
    "then , we can define the _ grade _ of an arbitrary state in this module to be the difference between the dimension of the state and the minimal dimension .",
    "it should be clear that we require this bounded - below property for the modules we are fusing _ and _ the modules we generate via fusion .",
    "indeed , when we say that the fusion representation space is constructed to grade @xmath110 , we mean that upon decomposition , the structure of each component module is determined to grade @xmath110 in the above sense .",
    "we will not need to enter into the details of this algorithm .",
    "computing to grade @xmath85 turns out to suffice for our purposes , and so we will only determine the action of the @xmath13-subalgebra spanned by the zero - modes @xmath111 , @xmath32 and @xmath52 .",
    "the master equations give this action as @xmath112 which is identical to the tensor product @xmath13-action ( on @xmath13-modules ) .",
    "the fusion of @xmath5-modules to grade @xmath85 therefore only differs from the tensor product of the corresponding grade @xmath85 @xmath13-modules if there are non - trivial spurious states .",
    "we point out that if we find a spurious state , then acting upon it with any @xmath113 must give another spurious state .",
    "the spurious states therefore form a representation of the zero - mode @xmath13-subalgebra .",
    "consider first fusing the vacuum module @xmath81 with some other module @xmath114 .",
    "we require only that the zero - grade states of @xmath114 form an irreducible @xmath13-module .",

    "there are vanishing singular vectors in at least one of the @xmath5-modules , so there could be spurious states .",
    "but , the working space is isomorphic to a single irreducible @xmath13-module , so the existence of spurious states would mean that the fusion product is empty ! the possibilities are therefore that fusing a module with the vacuum gives the module back again or nothing .",
    "suppose therefore that @xmath115 is empty for some module @xmath114 in our theory .",
    "as @xmath114 must have a conjugate representation @xmath116 in the theory , @xmath117 . by hypothesis ,",
    "the result of fusing the left hand side of this rule with @xmath81 is empty , hence @xmath118 must also be empty . but",
    "this implies that the vacuum is a null state , which requires the existence of a logarithmic partner ( as we noted above ) .",
    "we may therefore proceed under the assumption that @xmath115 is not empty for any module in our theory  this will only be invalidated if we find that it leads to a logarithmic partner to the vacuum . as we will see , we do not find this outcome , hence it is consistent to insist that the irreducible vacuum module @xmath81 acts as the fusion identity on every module in the theory for each of our admissible modules using the nahm - gaberdiel - kausch algorithm .",
    "but the above argument is much more elementary , and has the additional advantage of drawing attention to the subtleties possible when one does find logarithmic structure .",

    "a more interesting computation is to determine the fusion of the module @xmath99 with itself . computing to grade @xmath85 again , we may regard the working space as the tensor product of the fundamental representation of @xmath13 with itself .",
    "this decomposes as the direct sum of the trivial and adjoint representations , so the working space contains a @xmath13-highest weight state of weight @xmath105 . in the absence of any spurious states",
    ", this would imply that the fused module contains a @xmath5-highest weight state of weight @xmath119 .",

    "we can continue in a similar fashion to determine the fusion rules of the other admissible modules .",
    "in particular , we obtain @xmath122 without fuss .",
    "the rest of the fusion rules are more delicate to analyse however .",
    "for example , considering @xmath123 to grade @xmath85 as above , the working space decomposes as an @xmath13-representation into an infinite direct sum - representations are unitary with respect to the @xmath124 adjoint @xmath125 , @xmath126 .",
    "] of irreducibles whose highest weights are @xmath127 .",
    "proceeding as above , we would conclude that none of these highest weights are allowed , hence that all states are spurious and the fusion product is empty .",
    "but as with @xmath99 , insisting on a conjugate for @xmath128 , even if we have not yet identified it , again leads to a contradiction .",
    "the loophole is in trusting that a non - spurious @xmath13-highest weight state corresponds to an @xmath5-highest weight state .",
    "we could trust this correspondence in the previous examples because the nahm - gaberdiel - kausch algorithm gives us , grade by grade , the affine structure of the fused module .",
    "however , this algorithm does not make sense if the conformal dimensions of the states of the fused module are not bounded from below ( recall that in this situation , the concept of grade is not defined ) . before",
    ", this boundedness property was guaranteed because we only had finitely many irreducible representations of the zero - mode @xmath13-subalgebra . in the case at hand",
    "however , there are infinitely many such representations , so the conformal dimension need not be bounded from below .",
    "indeed , we can not even compute the conformal dimensions of the @xmath13-highest weight states without assuming something about the fused module structure . the correct conclusion to draw from our analysis",
    "is that either @xmath123 is empty , which leads to a contradiction , or that it gives a module whose states have arbitrarily negative conformal dimension .",
    "in fact , it is not too difficult to justify directly that the second option is what actually occurs . to do this ,",
    "we make use of the automorphisms of our symmetry algebra , in particular the _ spectral flow _ automorphisms ( described in detail in appendix  [ appspecflow ] ) . for @xmath5 ,",
    "the spectral flow is freely generated by a single automorphism @xmath129 which may be taken to act by ( see equation  ( [ eqnspecflowa1 ] ) )    [ eqnsf ] @xmath130    we consider the induced action of @xmath129 on the vacuum .",
    "specifically , we determine the @xmath13-weight and conformal dimension of @xmath131 : @xmath132 similarly , one can check that @xmath133 is a highest weight state .",
    "this therefore suggests that @xmath134 this is to be interpreted as @xmath135 , where @xmath136 denotes the representation ( map ) of @xmath5 on @xmath43 .",
    "note that here @xmath137 is acting as an automorphism on @xmath5 , whereas @xmath129 denotes the induced isomorphism of vector spaces acting on the states ( as in @xmath131 above ) .",
    "we can prove ( [ eqnmapi ] ) in many ways .",
    "first , we can note that what we have proven is the corresponding equality of verma modules .",
    "we should therefore explicitly check that the expressions for the two vanishing singular vectors of each module are mapped to zero by @xmath129 and @xmath137 ( as appropriate ) .",
    "a second proof involves verifying that the characters satisfy @xmath138 where @xmath139 and @xmath140 denote the @xmath13-weight and conformal dimension of @xmath141 ( respectively ) .",
    "this can be done in a straight - forward fashion using the character formulae given in equations  ( [ eqnch0 ] ) and ( [ eqnch-1/2 ] ) .",
    "however , it is far more elegant to simply observe that twisting a representation by an algebra automorphism clearly preserves irreducibility . to this third proof , we add the practical method of looking at the picture of @xmath81 in figure  [ figadmissreps ] , turning one s head @xmath142 to the right , and comparing with the picture of @xmath128 there . in this way",
    ", we observe that the multiplicities of the appropriate weight spaces precisely match .",
    "this actually constitutes a rigorous proof in itself because the pictures in figure  [ figadmissreps ] show the multiplicities to sufficiently deep grades ( in general , both pictures must show that the generating singular vectors vanish ) .",
    "we can similarly study the spectral flow of @xmath99 .",
    "proceeding as above , we compute that the image of the highest weight state @xmath143 under @xmath129 has @xmath13-weight @xmath92 and conformal dimension @xmath144 .",
    "it is not a highest weight state : @xmath145 instead , it is the image of @xmath146 which becomes the highest weight state of the flowed module @xmath147 .",
    "this can be checked explicitly , but is most easily seen from figure  [ figadmissreps ] . since @xmath148 has @xmath13-weight @xmath7 and conformal dimension @xmath93 , it now follows that @xmath149    we can apply our new - found knowledge regarding the action of the spectral flow automorphisms to the computation of fusion rules .",
    "this relies upon the principle that the fusion rules respect these automorphisms in the following manner : @xmath150 here , @xmath151 and @xmath152 are automorphisms .",
    "this principle is well - known from studies of rational conformal field theories with lie algebra symmetries . despite its natural appearance , we are not aware of any formal general proof .",
    "it has however been checked explicitly in many non - trivial cases ( see @xcite in particular ) .",
    "for example , we can determine @xmath153 by applying @xmath154 ( in hopefully obvious notation ) to @xmath155 .",
    "the result reproduces the first fusion rule of ( [ eqnfr1xadmiss ] ) .",
    "more importantly , we can apply this principle to compute the fusion of @xmath128 with itself .",
    "the result is therefore that this gives the module @xmath156 ( and indeed we see that the fusion is not empty ) .",
    "this module is not one of the admissibles that we have considered .",
    "indeed , it is not even a highest weight module , as can be seen by looking at the picture of @xmath128 in figure  [ figadmissreps ] and turning one s head @xmath142 to the right .",
    "this is perhaps physically distasteful , but is an unavoidable feature of the theory .",
    "we remark that the conformal dimensions of the states in this module with a given @xmath13-weight _ are _ bounded below .",
    "it follows from this that operator products of the corresponding fields may still be expanded as a laurent series ( with poles of finite order ) .",
    "the standard field - theoretic machinery of conformal field theory may therefore be carried across to these modules without difficulty .",
    "it is now trivial to determine the remaining fusion rules of the admissible modules : @xmath157 moreover , we now see that the spectrum contains the modules @xmath158 and @xmath159 for all @xmath160 .",
    "extending this to @xmath160 negative also makes sense , and is in fact necessary for physical consistency .",
    "otherwise ( for example ) , @xmath128 would have no conjugate within the spectrum , so correlation functions of its fields with any other fields would vanish , leading to the effective decoupling ( and removal ) of @xmath128 from the theory .",
    "the conjugate of @xmath161 is of course @xmath162 .",
    "this is not a highest weight module  one pictures it by looking at @xmath81 in figure  [ figadmissreps ] and turning one s head @xmath142 to the left  as its zero - grade states form a _",

    "we indicate this module ( and other flowed modules ) schematically in figure  [ figspecflow ] .",

    "consider now the characters of the modules comprising our theory .",
    "we have already determined the characters of @xmath81 and @xmath99 and their images under @xmath129 , and it is easy to use the explicit spectral flow action to determine expressions for those which remain . but let us first take this opportunity to rewrite the known characters in a more standard form @xcite",

    "however , it is easy to check from equations  ( [ eqncharsf0 ] ) and ( [ eqncharsf1 ] ) that the common denominator is antiperiodic under @xmath193 , hence periodic under @xmath194 .",
    "moreover , the numerators of the spectrally - flowed characters of @xmath81 and @xmath99 are interchanged ( with an additional factor of @xmath195 ) under @xmath194 , and are thus periodic under @xmath196 .",
    "it therefore follows that these expressions for the spectrally - flowed characters are periodic in @xmath160 with period @xmath80 , and that there are only four linearly independent characters ( there are actually eight distinct characters , but four are just the negatives of the other four ) .",
    "we can take these to be the characters of the admissible highest weight modules @xmath81 , @xmath99 , @xmath161 and @xmath197 .",
    "the spectral flow action on the characters may then be summarised as @xmath198 this seems to contradict the fact that the corresponding modules are all distinct .",
    "there are no isomorphisms between the spectrally - flowed modules , but nevertheless there is an infinite degeneracy of the characters .",
    "a resolution to this seeming contradiction was proposed in @xcite , where it was noted that one has to pay close attention to the regions of convergence of such character formulae .",
    "the problem is very much related to the more transparent example of @xmath13 characters . here , a highest weight verma module with highest weight @xmath38 has character @xmath199 similarly , a lowest weight verma module with lowest weight @xmath200 has character @xmath201 formally , these characters give the same function ( up to a conspicuous factor of @xmath195 ) , but the notion that the modules are ( almost ) the same is patently absurd .",
    "the point is that in general the physical module is determined by its character _ and _ the given region of convergence .",
    "it is the latter which dictates the formal expansion , here in powers of @xmath202 or @xmath203 .",
    "note that finite - dimensional @xmath13-modules have characters that are polynomial in @xmath204 and @xmath205 , hence converge when @xmath206 ( indeed , everywhere ) .",
    "the @xmath0 character formulae we have derived have to be understood in a similar way .",
    "specifically , the infinite sums appearing in the numerators and denominators of these formulae are easily checked to converge for all @xmath207 , provided that @xmath208 .",
    "however , the common denominator of these expressions vanishes whenever @xmath209 ( @xmath210 ) .",
    "this is obvious from its product form ( displayed in equation  ( [ eqnchv0 ] ) for example ) , but it is also useful to check this from the above sum form : @xmath211 } \\notag \\\\ & = q^{-i^2 / 2 } { \\left [ \\sum_{s \\in { \\mathbb{z}}- \\tfrac{\\ell + i}{2 } - \\tfrac{1}{4 } } q^{2s^2 } - \\sum_{s \\in { \\mathbb{z}}+ \\tfrac{\\ell + i}{2 } - \\tfrac{1}{4 } } q^{2s^2 } \\right ] } = 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as @xmath212 .",
    "the character formulae will therefore have poles at @xmath209 ( @xmath210 ) unless the zeroes of the denominator are cancelled by zeroes in the numerator ( this is what happens in the integrable module case ) .",
    "but , analysing the numerators of equations  ( [ eqncharsf0 ] ) and ( [ eqncharsf1 ] ) as above , we find that zeroes occur only at @xmath213 with @xmath214 .",
    "it follows that the character formulae we have given for the modules @xmath158 and @xmath159 have poles at @xmath209 for all @xmath215 .",
    "we have argued above with the example of @xmath13 that the relationship between a character and the module it is supposed to describe is determined by the region in which the character is to be expanded .",
    "it is now clear how this applies to the present case .",
    "the characters given for @xmath81 and @xmath99 should be expanded on the annulus @xmath216 .",
    "note that as @xmath208 , this covers the case @xmath206 .",
    "accordingly , when @xmath185-expanding equations  ( [ eqnchar0 ] ) and ( [ eqnchar1 ] ) , the coefficients simplify to give ( laurent ) polynomials in @xmath204 as the constituent @xmath13-modules are all finite - dimensional .",
    "the spectral flow action now implies that the appropriate region on which to properly expand the characters ( [ eqncharsf0 ] ) and ( [ eqncharsf1 ] ) with @xmath217 is the annulus @xmath218 note that when @xmath219 , we have @xmath220 , appropriate for highest weight @xmath13-modules , and for @xmath221 , we have @xmath222 , appropriate for lowest weight @xmath13-modules .",
    "this accords with the pictures we have drawn in figure  [ figspecflow ] .    for @xmath223",

    "these coefficients may then be expanded for either @xmath220 or @xmath222 , as appropriate , in order to recover the correct weight multiplicities of the module . however , for @xmath224 , this procedure fails .",
    "for example , @xmath185-expanding equation  ( [ eqncharsf0 ] ) with @xmath225 gives polynomial coefficients in @xmath204 because this character coincides with that of @xmath99 up to an overall factor of @xmath195 ( equation  ( [ eqnlinindchars ] ) ) .",
    "the expansion annulus ( [ eqnannulus ] ) for @xmath225 is disjoint from that for @xmath226 , so a nave @xmath185-expansion are bounded from below , such as one obtains from computer algebra packages . ] is no longer appropriate . indeed , for this module the conformal dimension is not bounded below , so the correct expansion would have to include arbitrarily negative powers of @xmath185 as well as the usual positive powers . to obtain such an expansion",
    ", we would have to change variables to @xmath227 , effectively undoing the spectral flow , then @xmath185-expand and change @xmath228 back again .",
    "it is clear therefore that the explicit expressions we have given for the modules @xmath158 and @xmath159 with @xmath224 are not actually particularly useful .",
    "the point however is that any other expression we might cook up will be equivalent to these because the classical theta functions from which they are constructed are entire in the @xmath204-plane ( when @xmath208 ) .",
    "the conclusion is that by expressing the characters in terms of these functions , instead of as formal power series , we lose the equivalence between modules and characters .",
    "we have an infinite collection of distinct modules , but only four linearly independent characters .",
    "more precisely , the @xmath229-linear map which assigns to each module in the fusion ring its character is not one - to - one .",
    "it is not hard to check that the kernel of this map is generated by the modules @xmath230 and that these modules are closed under fusion .",
    "it follows that we can consistently define fusion at the level of characters .",
    "we call the resulting ring over @xmath229 the _ grothendieck ring _ of characters . assigning modules",
    "their characters therefore defines a projection ( more precisely , an onto ring homomorphism ) from the fusion ring onto the grothendieck ring .",
    "this has a peculiar effect when considering modular invariance .",
    "specifically , one expects from rational theories that pairing each module with itself under the holomorphic and antiholomorphic @xmath5-actions leads to a modular invariant partition function .",
    "but in our case , the coincidence of characters means that there are infinitely many modules all contributing the same amount to the partition function , which therefore diverges .",
    "one can of course regularise this divergence by only allowing the linearly independent characters to contribute , effectively dividing the modular invariant by the infinite multiplicity of each independent character , and in this way one recovers the modular invariant of kac and wakimoto @xcite ( we postpone a proper discussion of modularity until section  [ secmod ] ) .",
    "this is indeed invariant under the usual action of @xmath2 , but we should be uneasy about its status as a physical partition function .",
    "it does not , strictly speaking , refer to a complete set of modules of the theory .",
    "in particular , there is no set of modules corresponding to this partition function which is closed under fusion .",
    "in essence however , what this does is determine a modular invariant partition function in the grothendieck ring of characters .",
    "this is no different to what one does in rational theories , and evidence is steadily mounting that this is what one should do in logarithmic theories as well .",
    "however , it is clear that determining a modular invariant in this way does not answer the fundamental question of how the holomorphic and antiholomorphic sectors of the theory are glued together .",
    "for this reason , we advise caution in treating such modular invariants as physical .",
    "applications require a justification of why such a partition function is appropriate .",
    "we briefly compare this conclusion with that of @xcite .",
    "their proposal for making sense of kac and wakimoto s invariant is to regard the character of @xmath163 as only being defined on the annulus ( [ eqnannulus ] ) . summing to get a partition function",
    "is therefore viewed as summing over the different annuli in order to have a finite meromorphic partition function on the @xmath204-plane ( with @xmath208 ) .",
    "presumably this means each character should take value zero outside its given annulus , in defiance of analytic continuation .",
    "evidence for this proposal is quoted in the claim that a particular modular transformation maps the annuli into one another .",
    "this claim is not true .",
    "even if it were , the other transformations do not preserve this annulus structure , hence one is _ forced _ to analytically continue the characters into the rest of the @xmath204-plane .",
    "we agree that it would be better to extend the definition of partition function so that every module contributes , but the interpretation of @xcite does not achieve this goal .",
    "what is needed in our opinion is an additional quantum number to distinguish representations with the same character .",
    "it is not clear however that such a quantum number need exist .",
    "it seems plausible that modular invariants for fractional level models can only be defined at the level of grothendieck rings .",
    "note that the fusion rules of @xmath0 ( equation  ( [ eqnfr ] ) ) show that every module in the spectrum is a simple current  these are distinguished in general by the property that fusing them with any irreducible module gives a single irreducible factor @xcite .",
    "this is clear for the modules @xmath158 as they are automorphic images of the vacuum module . for the other modules , this follows because @xmath99 happens to be a simple current .",
    "this is somewhat mysterious as @xmath99 is not related to the vacuum by any automorphism of @xmath5 . nevertheless , this is the only simple current which has finite order , and its order is @xmath105 ( equation  ( [ eqnfr1x1 ] ) ) .",
    "it is therefore interesting to study the _ extended algebra _ defined by this simple current , more precisely , by the zero - grade fields of the module @xmath99 .",
    "their conformal dimension is @xmath92 which suggests some sort of fermionic behaviour .",
    "correctly determining an extended algebra can be a somewhat subtle business , and we shall proceed carefully in an elementary fashion",
    ". the final answer may not be particularly surprising , but there are several pitfalls to avoid during the derivation which we would like to draw attention to .",
    "let us begin by introducing some convenient notation for the zero - grade fields of the simple current .",
    "we will denote the field corresponding to the highest weight state @xmath231 by @xmath232 and that corresponding to the descendant @xmath146 by @xmath233 .",

    "this is true even for admissible levels , and the proof is easy in this special case .",

    "the corresponding conclusion for the zero - grade descendant field @xmath233 is identical . to settle the remaining ambiguity , we need to extend the adjoint ( [ eqndefadj ] ) to the simple current fields .",
    "needless to say , the adjoint must define an ( antilinear ) antiautomorphism on the extended algebra , and it is this requirement that we shall exploit .",
    "since @xmath99 is self - conjugate , the extended adjoint must take the form @xmath243 where the bar denotes complex conjugation .",
    "we now translate the primary field operator product expansions into modes using equation  ( [ eqnmutloc ] ) .",

    "there are no further constraints to be found , so we are free to choose the most symmetric consistent solution : @xmath250 it follows that @xmath14 and @xmath16 are both mutually fermionic with respect to @xmath232 and @xmath233 , as claimed .",
    "we can now turn to the operator product expansions of the simple current fields . from equation  ( [ eqnfr1x1 ] ) and",

    "these are easily computed .",
    "for example , the first expansion implies that @xmath255 . comparing @xmath256",
    "immediately yields @xmath257 .",

    "it follows that @xmath262 also has norm @xmath183 ( these norms are the respective constants in the singular term of the operator product expansions ( [ eqnopesphipsi ] ) ) .",
    "we also need to determine the mutual locality of the simple current fields with one another , and this follows easily from the above operator product expansions .",
    "for example , if @xmath263 , then inserting the operator product expansions ( [ eqnopesphipsi ] ) gives @xmath264 taylor - expanding @xmath265 about @xmath266 , we see that @xmath267 . thus , @xmath232 and @xmath233 are mutually fermionic with respect to each other .",
    "similarly , we can prove that both simple current fields are mutually bosonic with respect to themselves .",
    "finally , we have to verify that the operator product expansions we have derived are _",
    "associative_. for this we need to consider operator products of three fields .",
    "the associativity when at least one of the fields is an affine current is built into the above derivations , so we only need to check the case where all three fields are simple current fields . for example , since @xmath14 and @xmath232 are mutually fermionic , we see that @xmath268 } { \\phi \\left ( x \\right ) } = - { \\phi \\left ( x \\right ) } { \\left [ -2 { e \\left ( w \\right ) } + \\ldots \\right ] } = - { \\phi \\left ( x \\right ) } { \\phi \\left ( z \\right ) } { \\phi \\left ( w \\right)}.\\ ] ] however , this contradicts the fact that @xmath232 is mutually bosonic with respect to itself .",

    "it is worth emphasising once again the fundamental rle played by the adjoint ( [ eqndefadj ] ) in deriving the extended algebra in the previous section .",
    "this is the adjoint corresponding to the real form @xmath278 of @xmath279 .",
    "we could also consider the adjoint corresponding to the real form @xmath124 : @xmath280 when we wish to emphasise that the chiral algebra @xmath5 comes equipped with one of these adjoints , we will denote it by @xmath281 or @xmath282 , as appropriate .",
    "we stress that these are still complex lie algebras . in general , every order-@xmath105 automorphism of a complex simple lie algebra @xmath283 induces is the automorphism , the induced adjoint is given by @xmath284 , where @xmath285 is either an element of the cartan subalgebra or a root vector .",

    "we want to repeat the derivation of the extended algebra using the @xmath124 adjoint . the result will be slightly different , but the derivation is significantly simpler .",
    "the point here is that the choice of adjoint makes a real difference to simple current extensions of a chiral algebra . in the theory we are constructing",

    "however , in concrete applications one generally does have a given adjoint , so it is extremely important to be sure that the extended algebra one derives and works with is the correct one .",
    "to proceed , we have to change our basis to something appropriate for @xmath124 .",
    "the problem here is that the eigenvectors @xmath14 and @xmath16 of @xmath288 are not raising and lowering operators with respect to the adjoint ( [ eqndefotheradj ] ) . instead , we introduce the linear combinations @xmath289 ( of @xmath290 ) . these can be quickly checked to satisfy @xmath291 } = 2e \\qquad \\text{and } \\qquad { \\bigl [ h , f \\bigr ] } = -2f,\\ ] ]",

    "we will _ not _ change the normalisation of the central extension @xmath25 and derivation @xmath30 , as compared with equation  ( [ eqncommrels ] ) ( we mention this as many articles implicitly replace @xmath25 by @xmath296 which changes the prefactor of @xmath30 in the sugawara construction ) .",
    "consider now the zero - grade states @xmath261 and @xmath141 of the simple current module @xmath99 .",
    "just as we have had to change the basis of algebra generators to account for the @xmath124 adjoint , so we need to change this basis .",

    "again , there is a subtle difference in the structure : @xmath303 this is reflected in the norms : if @xmath304 has norm @xmath183 , then @xmath305 has norm @xmath195 ( the fundamental representation of @xmath13 is not unitarisable with respect to the @xmath124 adjoint ) .",
    "we can now repeat the computations of section  [ secghost ] .",
    "first , it is clear that the operator product expansions of @xmath306 , @xmath40 or @xmath307 with the simple current fields @xmath308 or @xmath309 will lead to the same constraints on the mutual localities , namely @xmath310 we therefore determine when the adjoint extends to an antiautomorphism of the extended algebra . defining @xmath311 , hence @xmath312 , we take the adjoint of the algebra relation @xmath313 and compare it to the dual relation @xmath314 ( note the minus sign ! ) .",
    "this time we find that @xmath315 and @xmath316 , hence that @xmath317 and @xmath318 are real and _ positive_. the simplest solution is therefore @xmath319 the algebra generators are therefore mutually bosonic with respect to the simple current fields in this picture !",
    "this is evidently a more familiar situation than that which we found in section  [ secghost ] with the @xmath278 adjoint .",
    "continuing with the extended algebra derivation , we can determine the defining operator product expansions :    [ eqnnewopes ] @xmath320    ( note that the constants appearing in the singular term of these operator product expansions correspond to the respective norms of @xmath305 and @xmath304 ) .",
    "it follows immediately from these expansions that the simple current fields are mutually bosonic with respect to themselves and each other , and it is simple to show that these expansions determine an associative operator product algebra ( without any additional @xmath269-type operators ) . the correspondence with the ghost fields is therefore as natural as it could be : @xmath321 moreover , the adjoint on the ghost fields is just @xmath322 and @xmath323 .",
    "it is appropriate now to discuss the reverse procedure , obtaining the @xmath0 symmetry from studying the @xmath1 ghost system , for this was how these theories were first related ( see @xcite for example ) . from equations  ( [ eqnnewopes ] ) and ( [ eqnnewghosts ] )",
    ", we see that the composite fields @xmath324 together reconstitute the @xmath5 generators .",
    "moreover , explicit calculation confirms that these are the @xmath124-type generators of this section .",
    "furthermore , the ghost adjoint @xmath322 now implies the adjoint ( [ eqndefotheradj ] ) .",
    "to summarise , the last two sections prove that the @xmath1 ghost system is naturally a simple current extension of @xmath325 ( we remind the reader again that we do not negate the level here ) . in order to realise these ghosts as an extension of @xmath326 ,",
    "it is _ necessary _ to augment the ghost algebra by the operator @xmath269 .",
    "it is not hard to find examples in the literature where this subtlety has been overlooked , so we want to emphasise the precise results derived here . ignoring this leads to contradictions in the algebra when delving deeper into the module structure @xcite .",
    "we now turn to a discussion of the representations of our extended algebra ( [ eqnnewopes ] ) , or equivalently , of the ghost system ( [ eqnghost ] ) ( we work with @xmath282 for simplicity ) .",
    "the corresponding algebra relations are @xmath327 } = 0 , \\qquad { \\bigl [ \\psi_m , \\phi_n \\bigr ] } = \\delta_{m+n,0 } \\qquad \\text{and } \\qquad { \\bigl [ \\psi_m , \\psi_n \\bigr ] } = 0,\\ ] ] where we write @xmath328 and @xmath329 as usual . since @xmath330 we see that each ( irreducible ) extended module will be labelled by a single integer @xmath160 , and be composed of two @xmath0-modules , @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "we denote this extended module by @xmath331 ( @xmath180 ) .    to understand the structure of these extended modules",

    "the monodromy charge may be defined @xcite in terms of the powers of @xmath335 appearing in the operator product expansions of the simple current fields @xmath336 and @xmath337 with a field @xmath338 associated to a state of the extended module @xmath331 .",
    "the simple current property means that the powers of @xmath335 which appear only differ by an integer , and their common value _",
    "@xmath229 defines the monodromy charge ( strictly speaking , this is the negative of the monodromy charge ) .",
    "this is also obviously independent of the choice of @xmath339 and simple current field .    from equation  ( [ eqntransauts ] )",
    ", we can compute ( as in section  [ secfusion ] ) that @xmath340 has conformal dimension @xmath341 whereas that of @xmath342 is @xmath343 .",
    "the fusion rules ( [ eqnfrsc ] ) then imply that the monodromy charges of @xmath158 and @xmath159 are @xmath344 respectively .",
    "the monodromy charge of the extended module @xmath331 is therefore well - defined ( as claimed ) and is simply @xmath345 it now follows that when @xmath336 and @xmath337 act upon a state @xmath346 ( with monodromy charge @xmath332 ) , they must be expanded in the forms @xmath347 in other words , the modes @xmath333 and @xmath334 with @xmath348 act on the extended algebra modules @xmath331 with @xmath349 , and the modes @xmath333 and @xmath334 with @xmath350 act on the extended algebra modules @xmath331 with @xmath351 .",
    "for example , the extended vacuum module @xmath352 has monodromy charge @xmath85 , so @xmath333 and @xmath334 act upon it with half - integer indices",

    "we recall from section  [ secfusion ] that every module in our @xmath0 theory could be regarded as the image under a spectral flow automorphism of either @xmath81 or @xmath99 .",

    "this is indeed the case .",

    "we can see that these are different by determining the action of @xmath357 on the @xmath281 basis : @xmath358 while this can be checked to indeed provide a non - trivial automorphism ( of @xmath359 ) , it is not clear whether it is of any use in further analysing our theory .",

    "the latter modules do not appear in the list of admissible modules , but their characters satisfy ( section  [ secchar ] ) @xmath417 this precisely accounts for the negative off - diagonal entries in @xmath4 . put differently , this shows that @xmath4 represents conjugation on the grothendieck ring of characters ( section  [ secchar ] ) .",

    "if one neglects these signs ( as in @xcite ) , then the `` invariant '' transforms non - trivially under the modular @xmath3 transformation .",

    "we use ( twice ) the fact that @xmath473 for all weights @xmath38 and @xmath182 .    putting this all together ( and remembering that @xmath449 ) ,",
    "we finally obtain @xmath474 this then completes the description of the automorphisms of @xmath286 induced by the translation subgroup of the affine weyl group .",
    "it is not hard to check now that powers of @xmath455 act as follows :    [ eqntransauts ] @xmath475    these automorphisms are examples of _ spectral flow _ automorphisms .",
    "however , they do not usually exhaust the latter in general , as we shall see .",
    "having determined the explicit action of the algebra automorphisms induced by the affine weyl group , we can turn to the remaining automorphisms of @xmath286 , the outer automorphisms induced by the symmetries of the dynkin diagram . unlike the ( non - trivial ) affine weyl transformations , these preserve a given set of a simple roots . indeed",
    ", an outer automorphism is completely determined by the permutation it induces on the ( chosen set of ) simple roots .",
    "the outer automorphisms of @xmath283 therefore just permute the root vectors @xmath443 and @xmath476 of @xmath286 without changing the grade @xmath184 .",
    "but , by analogy with the results of the previous section , we would like to understand the general case .",
    "happily , this is a simple endeavour .",
    "the automorphisms of @xmath286 which preserve the chosen cartan subalgebra can be decomposed into @xmath477 where @xmath478 denotes the dual of the root lattice .",
    "thus , our endeavour corresponds to generalising the results of appendix  [ appaffw ] to the outer automorphisms of @xmath283 ( which is trivial ) and replacing coroot lattice translations by dual root lattice translations .",
    "it is these dual root translations which generate the complete set of spectral flow automorphisms .",
    "in fact , it is easy to understand these latter translations .",
    "recall from equation  ( [ eqnstartingpoint ] ) that our starting point for constructing the automorphisms corresponding to a translation by the simple coroot @xmath453 was the effect on @xmath443 .",
    "everything else follows from this effect , which was to lower @xmath184 by @xmath479 .",
    "however , this index will still be an integer ( for all roots @xmath252 ) if we replace @xmath453 by an element of the dual root lattice @xmath478 , so it follows that such a replacement will still lead to a well - defined automorphism of @xmath286 .",
    "in fact , we can always choose a basis of @xmath478 whose @xmath480 elements are of the form @xmath481 for some @xmath482 and @xmath483 ( the fact that @xmath478 contains @xmath451 follows from the integrality of the cartan matrix ) .",
    "we may therefore determine generators of the automorphism group corresponding to dual root lattice translations by finding such a basis and applying equation  ( [ eqntransauts ] ) with @xmath160 fractional .",
    "note however that scaling @xmath437 by some factor @xmath484 corresponds to scaling @xmath252 by @xmath485 .",
    "for example , the coroot lattice of @xmath5 is generated by @xmath486 , so the coroot spectral flow automorphisms are generated by @xmath487 : @xmath488 the dual root lattice is however generated by @xmath489 .",
    "it follows that the spectral flow automorphisms are generated by @xmath490 . by equation  ( [ eqntransauts ] ) , the action of @xmath129 is given by @xmath491 it should be clear from these formulae why @xmath487 has a square root .    as a second example , the dual root lattice of @xmath492 is generated by @xmath493 and @xmath494 .",
    "we therefore have the spectral flow generators @xmath495 and @xmath496 , which act on @xmath492 via    @xmath497    finally , note that composing any representation of @xmath286 with an automorphism gives another representation . hence , spectral flow automorphisms induce maps ( vector space isomorphisms ) between @xmath286-modules .",
    "since such maps must preserve integrability , the set of integrable @xmath286-modules must close under the induced spectral flow .",
    "in fact , integrable modules are mapped to themselves when the spectral flow corresponds to a translation by a coroot lattice element .",
    "more general translations induce maps between integrable modules whose highest weights are related by an outer automorphism . in both cases",
    ", these maps are non - trivial and provide a wealth of information about the integrable modules .",
    "when the modules are not integrable , the spectral flow generally does not map any module to itself , even if the flow corresponds to a coroot translation . in this case , spectral flow automorphisms are useful for understanding the spectrum and for investigating the structure of the unfamiliar modules which arise .",
    "we collect here for convenience our notation for the jacobi theta functions and some of their important properties .",
