    "the composition and acceleration mechanism of the relativistic outflows that power gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are important open questions in this field  ( for a review see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in particular , their degree of magnetization and the role of magnetic fields in the acceleration or collimation of grb outflows is of great interest . in recent years",
    ", models in which the outflow is highly magnetized close to the source , and possibly also at very large distances from the source where much of the observed emission is produced , have been gaining popularity  @xcite and may provide a viable alternative to the traditional fireball model .",
    "some other relativistic outflow sources are even more likely strongly magnetized near the central source .",
    "pulsar winds are almost certainly poynting flux dominated near the source , and the same very likely also holds for active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and tidal disruption events ( tdes ) of a star by a super - massive black hole . in agn and tdes , which are often highly variable ( i.e. impulsive ) suggesting sub - shells in the outflow ,",
    "since the central accreting black hole is super - massive then even close to it the thompson optical depth @xmath0 may not be high enough for thermal acceleration by radiation pressure  the main competition to magnetic acceleration  to work efficiently ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "observations of relevant sources , such agn , grbs or pulsar wind nebulae suggest that the outflow magnetization is rather low at large distances from the source .",
    "an important outstanding question concerning outflows that start off highly magnetized near the source is how they convert most of their initial electromagnetic energy into the energy in the bulk and random motions particles , where the latter also produces the radiation we observe from these sources .",
    "this is known as the @xmath1 problem , namely how to transform from @xmath2 near the source to @xmath3 very far from the source , where the magnetization parameter @xmath1 is the poynting - to - matter energy flux ratio .",
    "different approaches to this problem have been considered so far .",
    "outflows that are initially poynting flux dominated are usually treated ( for simplicity ) under ideal mhd , axi - symmetry and steady - state . under these conditions , however , it is difficult to achieve sufficiently low magnetization ( @xmath4 or even @xmath3 ) at large distances from the source that would allow efficient dissipation in internal shocks  @xcite .",
    "a possible solution is that the magnetization remains high ( @xmath2 ) also at large distances from the source and the observed emission is powered by magnetic reconnection rather than by internal shocks  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the non - axi - symmetric kink instability could randomize the direction of the magnetic field , making it behave more like a fluid and enhancing magnetic reconnection , which both increase the acceleration and help lower the magnetization  @xcite .",
    "another option that may be relevant for agn and grbs  @xcite , is that if the poynting flux dominated outflow has alternating fields ( e.g. a striped wind ) then the kruskal - schwarzschild instability ( i.e. the magnetic version of the rayleigh - taylor instability ) of the current sheets could lead to significant magnetic reconnection , which in turn increases the initial acceleration resulting in a positive feedback and self - sustained acceleration that leads to a low magnetization .    here",
    "i focus on the effects of strong time dependence",
    " impulsive outflows that are initially highly magnetized , with @xmath5 , under ideal mhd .",
    "* hereafter paper i ) have recently found a new impulsive magnetic acceleration mechanism for relativistic outflows , which is qualitatively different from its newtonian analog  @xcite , and can lead to kinetic energy dominance and low @xmath1 that allow for efficient dissipation in internal shocks .",
    "paper i focused mainly on the acceleration of an initially highly magnetized shell of plasma into vacuum .",
    "the initial magnetic energy can be almost fully converted into kinetic form as the shell expands radially under its own magnetic pressure .",
    "initially , while it is still highly magnetized , this expansion leads to impulsive acceleration and the resulting increase in the lorentz contraction almost exactly cancels the increase in the shell s width in its own rest frame , leading to a constant width in the lab ( i.e. central source ) frame .",
    "once it becomes kinetically dominated it starts spreading radially significantly also in the lab frame , and its magnetization quickly drops to @xmath3 .",
    "paper i only briefly discussed the effects of the interaction with the external medium .",
    "the interaction with an unmagnetized external medium whose density varies as a power - law with the distance from the central source is analyzed in detail in an accompanying paper  ( * ? ? ? *",
    "hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "the present work generalizes this self - consistent treatment of the combined impulsive magnetic acceleration and deceleration by the external medium , by examining the effects of an outflow that is initially divided into many well separated sub - shells , instead of a single shell .",
    "such multiple sub - shells are both naturally expected in highly variable sources , and are also required in order to produce internal shocks ( where enabling efficient internal shocks is one of the main motivations for this type of model ) .    the basic test case examined in paper",
    "i was a highly magnetized shell initially at rest , whose back leans against a conducting wall and whose front edge faces vacuum , while in paper ii the vacuum is replaced by an unmagnetized external medium .",
    "as discussed in paper i , while such a setup might be directly applicable for , e.g , a giant flare from a soft gamma repeater , for most relevant astrophysical sources ( such as grbs , agn or micro - quasars ) we expect that initially a quasi - steady acceleration takes place and saturates at some radius ( i.e. distance from the source ) , while the impulsive acceleration mechanism takes over at a larger radius .",
    "the dynamics most relevant for our purposes occur after the impulsive acceleration takes over , and are insensitive to whether part of the earlier acceleration occurred in the quasi - steady regime ( while the jet was being collimated ) .",
    "however , during the impulsive acceleration phase the outflow still retains memory of its initial properties when it was ejected from the central source , namely the time history of its initial magnetization @xmath6 and ejected energy per unit time , which is reflected in the isotropic equivalent luminosity @xmath7 ( i.e. energy flux through a sphere of fixed radius if the outflow occupied all of the solid angle ) . during this phase",
    "the outflow opening angle remains roughly constant , and its dynamics are essentially spherical , and equivalent to those for the planar case , as shown in paper i.    the sub - shells are assumed to be initially well separated , uniform with sharp edges and separations comparable to or larger than their widths , and with a large contrast ( e.g. in energy density ) between the sub - shells and the `` gaps '' between them ( as might be the result of large variations in the energy output rate from the central source into the outflow ) .",
    "a modest contrast and/or very smooth edges for the sub - shells might cause the sub - shells to collide and merge earlier on , while they are still highly magnetized , making the outflow subsequently behave closer to the steady regime than to the impulsive regime . quantifying these effects ,",
    "however , is beyond the scope of this paper and is left for a separate work .    the basic physical setup explored in this work",
    "is described in  ",
    "[ sec : sub - shells ] , while    [ sec : identical ] studies in detail the main test case , namely the dynamics of @xmath8 identical sub - shells .",
    "i find several different cases for the dynamics , which naturally divide into three groups : ( i ) a low magnetization `` thin shell '' ( cases 1 and 2@xmath9 ) where a strong mildly relativistic reverse shock develops on a timescale larger than the duration of the prompt grb emission ( @xmath10 ) , ( ii ) a low or mild magnetization `` thick shell '' ( cases 2 and 3a ) , where a relativistic reverse shock develops whose emission peaks on a timescale comparable to that of the prompt grb emission ( @xmath11 ) , ( iii ) a high magnetization `` thick shell '' ( case 3b ) , where the reverse shock and its associated emission are strongly suppressed ( with @xmath11 where @xmath12 in this case can be identified through the afterglow emission , which peaks on this timescale ) .",
    "the first two groups , ( i ) and ( ii ) , naturally produce internal shocks at mild magnetization and high lorentz factors , which can help accommodate grb observations .",
    "the effects of varying the initial magnetization between different sub - shells are explored in   [ sec : vary - sigma ] , and i show that this is not expected to strongly affect the main results , even for strong initial variations ( and the same holds for order unity variations in the other model parameters ) .",

    "this would allow for reasonably efficient dissipation in the resulting internal shocks .",
    "if the trailing sub - shell has a lower initial magnetization than the leading one ( @xmath257 ) then the ( effective ) separation between the sub - shells initially increases during the acceleration stage . once the trailing sub - shell becomes kinetically dominated and starts coasting at @xmath258 it starts spreading radially , but even if its head moves at very close to the speed of light it would effectively collide with the bulk of the first sub - shell only after the latter starts spreading appreciably .",
    "such a spreading of the first sub - shell can occur either if it reaches its coasting radius ( @xmath245 ) and becomes kinetically dominated ( in which case both sub - shells would have a mild or low magnetization when they collide ) , or alternatively if it is still highly magnetized but decelerates as it transfers a good part of its energy to the sub - shell in front of it ( or the shocked external medium across the cd ) through @xmath127 work .    altogether",
    ", a reasonable spread in the initial magnetization of the sub - shells , of @xmath259 , would not have a very large effect on the overall dynamics or the efficiency of the resulting internal shocks .",
    "even a very high contrast , of @xmath260 , is expected to typically affect the overall efficiency of the internal shocks only by a factor of order unity ( since at least one of the sub - shells in each collision is expected to have mild or low magnetization ) .",
    "moreover , it is not even clear whether the overall efficiency would actually be decreased or increased , since while some of the collisions might occur where one of the colliding sub - shells has a higher magnetization ( compared to the case @xmath261 ) , the relative lorentz factor of the colliding shells can be higher , thus increasing the the efficiency of the dissipation in the low magnetization colliding sub - shell .",
    "similarly , order unity variations in @xmath32 , @xmath224 , or @xmath262 are not expected to have a very large effect on the overall dynamics or on the efficiency of the resulting internal shocks or reverse shock .    as for the reverse shock ,",
    "if some of the sub - shells remain highly magnetized within the merged shell that accumulates behind the cd , then this could suppress the reverse shock as it passes these sub - shells , thus effectively causing its emission to turn on and off as it passes regions ( corresponding to different original sub - shells ) of low and high magnetization .",
    "such a variable reverse shock emission might have been observed in some cases [ e.g. , grb  080319b @xcite , grb  070419a @xcite , grb  110205a @xcite ] .",
    "to summarize , when the outflow consists of a large number of well separated sub - shells there are three main regimes .",
    "one of them  the highly magnetized `` thick shell '' ( case 3b ; @xmath263 or @xmath264 ) is expected to result in a severe suppression of the reverse shock and its associated emission .",
    "nevertheless , the thick shell nature of this regime can be deduced from the fact that the onset time of the afterglow emission , @xmath12 , is similar to the duration of the prompt grb emission ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "therefore , this leaves two regimes for which a reasonably bright reverse shock emission may occur . in the low magnetization `` thick shell '' case ( i.e. cases 2 or 3a ; @xmath265 ) , which was described in this work , the mean magnetization of the merged shell at the time when its bulk is crossed by the relativistic reverse shock ( near @xmath266 ) is @xmath267 , i.e. it is expected to be less than unity but not by a large factor ( @xmath268 ) .",
    "thus , very low values of @xmath269 are not expected in this regime , whose main observational signature is that the afterglow emission and the reverse shock emission both peak on a timescale similar to the duration of the prompt grb emission ( @xmath270 ) .",
    "the expectations of this regime ( both in terms of @xmath11 and the value of @xmath271 ) appear consistent with the bright prompt optical emission from grb  990123 , which had been attributed to the reverse shock  @xcite . in the low magnetization `` thin shell '' case ( regime i ; cases 1 or @xmath189 ; @xmath272 ) , the deceleration time @xmath12 that corresponds to the duration of the peak reverse shock and afterglow emission components is expected to be larger than the prompt grb duration , @xmath273 , and the magnetization at the radius where most of the energy is dissipated in the reverse shock ( near @xmath205 ) is expected to be @xmath274 , i.e. a factor of @xmath275 smaller than in the low magnetization `` thick shell '' case .",
    "thus , a clear prediction of this model is a positive linear correlation between @xmath276 and @xmath271 when there is a bright reverse shock emission ( i.e. when @xmath277 ) .",
    "moreover , this model also has predictions for the internal shocks , which could be tested against observations if the prompt grb emission is indeed from such internal shocks .",
    "the internal shocks radius is given by @xmath278 which satisfies the usual relation , @xmath279 , where @xmath280 is the observed variability time in the prompt grb lightcurve .",
    "for reference , @xmath281 ( see eqs .  [",
    "23 ] and [ 45 ] of paper ii for the definition of @xmath282 and the derivation of @xmath54 ) and @xmath283 this shows that the relevant regimes correspond to reasonable model parameters , and could potentially occur in different grbs .",
    "the most uncertain parameter is the initial magnetization , @xmath77 or @xmath6 , whose value can be estimated in the low magnetization regimes , where the outflow becomes kinetically dominated ( with @xmath284 ; lower limits on @xmath285 also serve as lower limits on @xmath6 in this model , without requiring kinetic dominance ) .",
    "current constraints from pair opacity in the prompt emission and from the onset of the afterglow suggest @xmath286 . in case 3b , which corresponds to @xmath287 ,",
    "all of the sub - shells collide while they are still highly magnetized , which suppresses the internal shocks and their associated emission , making them unlikely to power the prompt grb emission ( which in this case might be alternatively powered by magnetic reconnection events in the highly magnetized outflow ) . in all other cases",
    "the internal shocks occur at mild or low magnetization , allowing them to be reasonably efficient and potentially power the prompt grb emission .",
    "the effects of sub - shells in an impulsive , initially highly magnetized relativistic outflow have been studied , and compared to the case of a single wide shell .",
    "it has been shown that if a single wide uniform outflow shell is divided into a large number of sub - shells with a reasonable initial contrast and spacing between them ( @xmath288 ) then it could reach a significantly higher lorentz factor .",
    "the sub - shells would effectively collide an merge well before their coasting radius ( by a factor of @xmath289 ) , while they are still highly magnetized ( @xmath290 ) , and would thus have a very small effect on the outflow , and in particular would not help to increase its maximal lorentz factor . however , this conclusion is wrong and arises due to an error in his eq .",
    "( 29 ) , which results in an incorrect expression for the collision time or radius . ]",
    "the leading sub - shells effectively clear the way for the subsequent sub - shells , allowing them to accelerate for a longer time without feeling the effects of the external medium ( almost as if into vacuum ) , thus enabling them to reach a higher lorentz factor .",
    "moreover , internal shocks arise from collisions between different sub - shells , which naturally occur at relatively high lorentz factors and at low magnetizations that are vital in order to have a reasonable energy dissipation efficiency in the internal shocks .    a sufficiently high lorentz factor is needed to overcome the compactness problem and avoid excessive pair production within the source  @xcite .",
    "it has been recently argued  @xcite that the interaction with the external medium might not enable an impulsive highly magnetized outflow in grbs to accelerate up to sufficiently high lorentz factors , and in particular that its maximal achievable lorentz factor is largely limited to @xmath291 .",
    "this would pose a particularly severe problem for a stellar wind - like external medium ( @xmath292 ) for which typically @xmath293 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : gamma_cr ] ] ) .",
    "recent high - energy observations by the fermi large area telescope ( lat ) have set a lower limit of @xmath294 for the emitting region in a number of grbs with a bright high - energy emission  @xcite using a simplified one - zone model .",
    "however , a more detailed and realistic treatment shows that the limit is lower by a factor of @xmath295  @xcite , which would correspond to @xmath296 for the brightest fermi lat grbs ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this might nevertheless still pose a problem for a single highly magnetized shell in a stellar - wind environment .",
    "the present work , however , shows that if it is divided into a large number of sub - shells , then its lorentz factor @xmath285 could exceed @xmath67 by up to a factor of @xmath297 . moreover , most of the dissipation in internal shocks is expected to occur near the maximal lorentz factor attained by the outflow",
    "this would greatly help satisfy the lower limits on @xmath285 from compactness arguments , or from the onset of the afterglow emission  ( usually around a few hundred ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , also for a stellar wind environment",
    ".    it has been found ( in papers i and ii ) that for a single shell there are two main dynamical regimes : the low magnetization `` thin shell '' ( regime i , where the shell becomes kinetically dominated , coasts and spreads radially , and a reverse shock develops that becomes mildly relativistic near the deceleration radius , @xmath298 , and whose emission peeks at @xmath299 ) , and the high magnetization `` thick shell '' ( regime ii or iii , where the shell remains highly magnetized without reaching a coasting stage or spreading radially , and the the reverse shock is suppressed along with its associated emission ) . a high magnetization `` thin shell '' or a low magnetization `` thick shell '' are not possible for a single initially highly magnetized shell . in this work",
    ", it has been shown that a low magnetization `` thick shell '' regime becomes possible ( and occurs in cases 2 or 3a ) if such an initially highly magnetized shell is divided into a large number of sub - shells with reasonable initial separations ( @xmath300 ) .",
    "this would allow a relativistic reverse shock with bright emission on a timescale comparable to that of the prompt grb emission ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "moreover , if there are large variations in the magnetization between different sub - shells , this might result in alternating regions of high and low magnetization through which the reverse shock passes , causing it and its associated emission to be alternately suppressed and revived , resulting in a variable reverse shock emission .",
    "such a reverse shock emission may bear some temporal correlation to the prompt emission from the internal shocks  ( somewhat analogous to the pure hydrodynamic case ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as both are affected by the magnetization of the sub - shells , though some delay might be expected between corresponding features in the internal shocks and in the reverse shock .",
