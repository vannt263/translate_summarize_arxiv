    "quantum stochastic calculus ( qsc ) @xcite , a noncommutative analog of the classical ito s stochastic calculus , revealed to be a powerful tool to construct mathematical models of quantum optical systems @xcite and to develop a theory of photon detection @xcite . just at the beginning of qsc ,",
    "hudson and parthasarathy proposed a quantum stochastic schrdinger equation for quantum open systems @xcite .",
    "such an equation has found applications in quantum optics , but not in its full generality @xcite .",
    "it has been used to give , at least approximately , the dynamics of photoemissive sources such as an atom absorbing and emitting light , or matter in an optical cavity , which exchanges light with the surrounding free space .",
    "but in these cases the possibility of introducing the so called gauge ( or number ) process in the dynamical equation has not been considered ; roughly speaking , the gauge process is a quadratic expression in the field operators which preserves the number of quanta , but changes their wave functions . in this paper",
    "we want to show , in the case of the simplest photoemissive source , namely a two - level atom stimulated by a laser , how the full hudson - parthasarathy equation allows to describe in a consistent way the scattering of the light by the atom not only through the absorption / emission channel , but also through another process which can be called `` direct scattering '' , which can be included in the interaction via a term containing the gauge process . when the atom is approximated by a two - level system , the introduction of an interaction term which preserves the number of photons allows to simulate also the scattering processes involving virtual transitions to states different from the two ones responsible of the real absorption / emission process .",
    "so , a first aim is to show how the full hudson - parthasarathy equation is able to give a reasonable and rich model for the dynamics of an atom interacting with the electromagnetic field",
    ". a second one will be the study of the elastic , inelastic and total cross sections for the scattering of monochromatic coherent light by the atom .",
    "the resulting line - shapes are very interesting .",
    "for instance , the dependence of the total cross section on the frequency of the stimulating laser can present not only a lorentzian shape , but the full variety of fano profiles @xmath0@xcite , @xcite pp .",
    "moreover , the dependence of the line shape on the intensity of the stimulating laser is computed and power broadening and intensity dependent shifts are found .",
    "the study of the inelastic cross section , instead , shows possible modifications to the known triplet structure of the fluorescence spectrum @xcite . some preliminary results on the total cross sections where reported in @xcite .",
    "let us recall some notions of qsc and the hudson - parthasarathy equation ; this is just to fix our notations , while for the proper mathematical definitions and the rules of qsc we refer to the book by parthasarathy @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath1 the boson fock space over the `` one - particle space '' @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is another separable complex hilbert space .",

    "@xmath8 in @xmath3 and we denote by @xmath9 the components of a vector @xmath10 in @xmath11 .",

    "the bose fields introduced here represent a good approximation of the electromagnetic field in the so called _ quasi - monochromatic paraxial approximation _",

    "if we forget polarization , the one - particle space @xmath34 has to contain only the degrees of freedom linked to the direction of propagation @xcite , so that we can take @xmath35 the angular coordinates @xmath36 represent the direction of propagation .",
