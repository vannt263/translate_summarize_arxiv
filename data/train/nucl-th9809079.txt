    "<S> we study the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition on the basis of a two - component lattice gas model . </S>",
    "<S> a metropolis type of sampling method is used to generate microscopic states in the canonical ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> the effective equation of state and fragment mass distributions are evaluated in a wide range of temperatures and densities . </S>",
    "<S> a definition of the phase coexistence region appropriate for mesoscopic systems is proposed . </S>",
    "<S> the caloric curve resulting from different types of freeze - out conditions are presented .    </S>",
    "<S> it is commonly believed that nuclear matter undergoes a liquid - gas phase transition at lower densities and temperatures . in the early 1980s </S>",
    "<S> it was suggested @xcite that this phase transition might be probed in heavy - ion collisions at intermediate energies by observing the disintegration of colliding nuclei into many fragments of different sizes , a phenomenon commonly known as _ </S>",
    "<S> multifragmentation_.    a wide variety of models has been proposed for nuclear multifragmentation , ranging from statistical to dynamical ones ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) . in principle , most of these models yield an equation of state of nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> the evaluation of the equation of state is , however , in general rather difficult and has only been done in some simple cases @xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the relationship between the fragmentation of a nuclear system and the corresponding equation of state , calculated on the basis of a two - component _ lattice gas model_. in particular , we will discuss the nuclear _ caloric curve _ ( temperature versus excitation energy ) resulting from different types of freeze - out conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the details of the model and the numerical simulations will be further discussed in a forthcoming article @xcite . here , we only present some main features and results of the model .    </S>",
    "<S> common for all types of lattice gas models is the use of a spatial lattice , with a certain dimension , number of sites , @xmath0 , and a certain bravais - structure , such that each lattice point has a fixed number of neighbours @xmath1 . for simplicity and for comparison with earlier works </S>",
    "<S> we consider here a simple cubic @xmath2 lattice with @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice spacing @xmath4 is chosen such that the density of a fully occupied lattice equals the nuclear ground state density @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath6 . the effective nucleon - nucleon @xmath7-interaction is represented by a nearest - neighbour square well potential @xmath8 with a repulsive hard core . in terms of the discritized lattice distance @xmath9 between the nucleons @xmath10 the potential is given as , @xmath11 here , @xmath12 denotes isospin of nucleon @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the interaction strength parameters . </S>",
    "<S> in fact we only allow for two such parameters , @xmath15 for @xmath16 and @xmath17 interacting pairs and @xmath18 for @xmath19 pairs . according to the dynamical potentials and previous works on lattice models </S>",
    "<S> @xcite @xmath18 is chosen slightly repulsive , @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the other parameter , @xmath15 , is chosen such that the nuclear binding energies are reproduced , @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath22 denote respectively the momentum and position of nucleon @xmath13 , the hamiltonian of the system of @xmath23 nucleons can be written as , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the nucleon mass . </S>",
    "<S> it can be shown that the interaction hamiltonian @xmath26 is homomorphic to the _ spin-1 ising model _ , which is well - known in solid state physics . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath15 is put equal to @xmath18 the model reduces to the standard lattice gas model which is isomorphic to the spin-1/2 ising model . </S>",
    "<S> this model was first considered in context of nuclear fragmentation in @xcite and later used by s. das gupta and j. pan @xcite and x. campi and h. krivine @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the two - component lattice gas model has also been used in @xcite .    in the following we </S>",
    "<S> will for simplicity treat the model in a canonical ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> this implies , that the temperature @xmath27 , the volume @xmath8 , the number of particles @xmath23 and the asymmetry of the system , @xmath28 , are the control variables . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we only consider symmetric matter , @xmath29 .    </S>",
    "<S> the states @xmath30 of the nuclear system can be classified by the positions , momenta and isospins of all the nucleons , @xmath31 . due to the classical nature of the model the canonical partition function , @xmath32 , </S>",
    "<S> can be factorized into two parts coming respectively from the momentum space and the configuration space . </S>",
    "<S> the first part is proportional to the partition function of an ideal gas . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of the momenta of the nucleons to the various thermodynamical quantities can therefore be calculated in a straightforward way .    </S>",
    "<S> the partition function and thus the helmholtz free energy , @xmath33 , of the configuration space is far less trivial to obtain . in this work </S>",
    "<S> it is done numerically by performing a monte carlo type of sampling . </S>",
    "<S> the realization of this sampling method consists of three parts : the initialization , the equilibration of the system and the calculation of ensemble averages .    </S>",
    "<S> the initialization of the system is done by putting the particles one by one in the lattice . at each step </S>",
    "<S> the spatial probability distribution is changed with a boltzmann factor , @xmath34 , in the neighbourhood of the first particle . </S>",
    "<S> this method of initializing the system is identical to the one used in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the equilibration of the system is performed by constructing a random walk of microscopic states @xmath35 through the configuration space via a _ </S>",
    "<S> markov process _ </S>",
    "<S> , starting from the initial state , @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the markov process is defined by specifying a general transition probability matrix , @xmath37 from the state @xmath30 to the state @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the choice of the transition matrix is dictated by the detailed balance condition . in the present work it is defined as , @xmath39 here </S>",
    "<S> , the test function , @xmath38 , is obtained from @xmath30 either by changing the position of a randomly chosen nucleon or by interchanging a randomly chosen proton - neutron pair . in case of acceptance </S>",
    "<S> , the trial function @xmath38 will be the new state of the system @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , the system remains in the same state , @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be proven formally @xcite that the above choice of @xmath42 leads to the desired convergence property , i.e. the equilibrated probability distribution of microscopic states will correspond to a macroscopic state of minimum free energy . </S>",
    "<S> this algorithm is similar to the one introduced by metropolis et . </S>",
    "<S> al @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> when equilibrium has been reached , the ensemble average @xmath43 of any quantity @xmath44 can be calculated by repeating the same procedure a certain number of times and recording the value of the quantity , @xmath45 , at each time step @xmath46 .    by a systematic variation of the density @xmath47 and the temperature </S>",
    "<S> @xmath27 the algorithm one can eventually probe all the different points of the phase diagram including the coexistence region . </S>",
    "<S> the density is varied by varying the number of particles in the lattice for a _ fixed _ volume . </S>",
    "<S> the volume is put to @xmath48 which approximately corresponds to the maximum fragment mass , @xmath49 , observed in heavy ion experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the boundaries of this lattice are chosen to be open to mimic the effect of the vacuum surrounding the real nuclear system . </S>",
    "<S> the results for periodic boundary conditions will be presented elsewhere @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the quantities , @xmath44 , of interest are the ensemble average @xmath50 of the potential energy @xmath26 , and the distributions of cluster sizes , i.e. the mean number of fragments , or the yield @xmath51 as a function of the mass number @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to most statistical models of nuclear fragmentation ( see i.e. @xcite and references herein ) , clusters are not explicitly defined in the lattice gas model . in our simulations </S>",
    "<S> we implement a definition based on pairwise binding . </S>",
    "<S> two neighbouring nucleons are thus prescribed to the same cluster if their relative kinetic energy is not sufficient to overcome the attractive bond : @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the relative momentum between the two particles . </S>",
    "<S> this definition was originally proposed by hill @xcite and has also been used by s. das gupta et . </S>",
    "<S> al @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> by applying the standard laws of thermodynamics all other quantities can be derived from the internal energy @xmath54 of the system in the different points , @xmath55 , of the phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most interesting applications is the study of the liquid - gas phase transition in a finite system . </S>",
    "<S> the first order phase transition is signalled by the presence of the phase co - existence region . in a finite system </S>",
    "<S> the definition of this region is somewhat ambiguous . in the calculations below such regions </S>",
    "<S> are identified by the existence of two distinct densities , @xmath56 , for which the following conditions are fulfilled , @xmath57 the points @xmath58 and @xmath59 belong to respectively the gas branch and the liquid branch of the co - existence curve . </S>",
    "<S> geometrically , the above criteria correspond to the requirement that the points @xmath60 and @xmath61 belong to a _ </S>",
    "<S> common tangent _ of the free energy density , @xmath62 . for a macroscopic system </S>",
    "<S> the free energy density would follow a straight line in the region @xmath63 . for a mesoscopic system </S>",
    "<S> the free energy density is slightly larger in this region due to the presence of an interface between the two phases .    </S>",
    "<S> the equation of state for the system with volume @xmath48 is depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 with the pressure @xmath64 as a function of density @xmath65 and temperature @xmath27 . the thick solid line is the co - existence curve calculated according to the definition ( [ binodal ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two branches of the curve terminate at the critical point @xmath66 . for comparison , the critical point in the macroscopic limit </S>",
    "<S> is found to be @xmath67 @xcite . in the co - existence region for a fixed temperature the pressure as a function of the density is almost a constant .    </S>",
    "<S> one should bear in mind that in experiment one observes only a final state of the system where the fragments cease to interact ( freeze - out configuration ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is not clear a priori which thermodynamical conditions correspond to these configurations . </S>",
    "<S> below we consider two possibilities corresponding to constant pressure and constant density at freeze - out . </S>",
    "<S> the two lines across the co - existence region are defined by @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the letters @xmath70 along the isobar are chosen with a fixed step in densities @xmath71 starting from @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> the letters along the isochor are chosen at the temperatures @xmath73 ( points @xmath74 and @xmath75 coincide ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the cluster size distribution corresponding to these points of the phase diagram are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a and 2b for the isobar @xmath76 and the isochor @xmath69 respectively . at point </S>",
    "<S> @xmath23 the system essentially consists of a compound nucleus surrounded by nucleons and small clusters . </S>",
    "<S> point @xmath23 belongs to the borderline of the co - existence region . at point </S>",
    "<S> @xmath77 the compound nucleus starts to break - up producing some intermediate mass fragments ( imfs : @xmath78 ) . at point @xmath79 and @xmath75 fragments of all different sizes </S>",
    "<S> are present , whereas at point @xmath54 the size distribution is exponentially decreasing indicating that only the gas phase is present . </S>",
    "<S> thus the appearance of imfs is a clear manifestation of the first - order liquid - gas phase transition .    </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the size distribution is observed to be smoother along the isochor . </S>",
    "<S> point @xmath80 belongs to a transition region for which the pressure increases rather abruptly . at even lower temperatures the system essentially consists of one compound nucleus surrounded by vacuum ( not shown ) </S>",
    "<S> the sudden increase of the pressure results from the break - up of this nucleus . as can be seen in the plot this produces some imfs . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution at point @xmath81 still contains a significant contribution of imfs although it does not belong to the co - existence region , according to definition of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ binodal ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the cluster size distribution alone can not give a unique relation between multifragmentation and liquid - gas phase transition . at point @xmath82 </S>",
    "<S> the distribution is closer to the exponential one .    </S>",
    "<S> figures 2a and 2b indicate that cluster size distributions are widest at the vicinity of the critical point . </S>",
    "<S> if the cluster size distribution is approximated by a power law @xmath83 , one finds that a good fit can be achieved for a wide range of temperatures and densities around the critical point . </S>",
    "<S> the range of fragment masses used for the power law fit was chosen to @xmath84 , but the conclusions are not very sensitive to this choice . </S>",
    "<S> typical values of @xmath85 per degree of freedom are in the range of @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that for each isochor , @xmath87 has a minimum at the binodal line . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , @xmath87 has a global minimum point in the vicinity of the critical point , where @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> this is in accordance with the value of the fisher exponent for the ising model , @xmath89 .    from the yield of clusters @xmath51 it is not easy to distinguish between the two types of freeze - out conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the difference reveals itself more clearly in the associated caloric curves , showing the variation of the temperature with respect to the excitation energy @xmath90 per nucleon . here , the excitation energy is defined as @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the total multiplicity of the system . </S>",
    "<S> note , that we identify the kinetic part of the excitation energy with the total kinetic energies of the clusters rather than the total kinetic energy @xmath93 of the individual constituents . </S>",
    "<S> the caloric curves for @xmath94 and for @xmath69 are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that the pronounced plateau in the caloric curve appears only in case of the fixed pressure condition . in both cases the caloric curve approaches a straight line for high temperatures . at low temperatures the model predictions are not accurate , since quantal effects can not be neglected in this region . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , the caloric curve at constant pressure looks very similar to the one predicted by the statistical multifragmentation model @xcite and recently observed in the aladin experiment @xcite .    to each of curves on the phase diagram , which correspond to a specific change of the system state in a reversible process , a particular heat capacity @xmath79 can be attributed . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows , that the specific heat capacity for fixed pressure , @xmath95 , in fact has a _ singularity _ along subcritical isobars . </S>",
    "<S> this infinity is related to the latent heat of the transition . on the other hand , due to </S>",
    "<S> finite size effects the specific heat capacity for fixed number of particles and volume , @xmath96 , is finite in all points of the phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> we will elaborate further on these points in a forthcoming publication @xcite .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate the close connection between the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition and the nuclear multifragmentation . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations have been made on the basis of a two - component lattice gas model . </S>",
    "<S> a sampling method has been presented by which both the effective equation of state and the fragment mass distributions have been evaluated in a consistent way . </S>",
    "<S> the method has an advantage compared to other statistical approaches to nuclear multifragmentation , where the link between the cluster observables and the corresponding thermodynamical properties of the nuclear system is less transparent .    </S>",
    "<S> we have proposed a definition of the phase transition , more relevant for finite systems , which is based on the identification of an interphase between the two phases . </S>",
    "<S> the relevance of this definition is supported by the critical exponent analysis and the singular behaviour of the specific heat capacity , @xmath95 , along subcritical isobars . </S>",
    "<S> we have examined the caloric curve resulting from two different freeze - out conditions . </S>",
    "<S> it was demonstrated that the occurrence of a plateau in the caloric curve seems to be consistent with the condition of constant and subcritical pressure in the freeze - out configurations .    </S>",
    "<S> there are of course some obvious deficiencies of the model . </S>",
    "<S> first , the true fermi - statistical nature of the nucleons can not be neglected for lower excitation energies . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the idea of a thermal bath is certainly an idealization and it is necessary to perform a real microcanonical sampling in the monte carlo algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> third , for larger systems it is necessary to include the coulomb repulsion and determine the corresponding change of the phase diagram . finally , the prescription of clusters in the model is still not unambiguous . </S>",
    "<S> the clusters defined by the pairwise binding are generally excited and should undergo de - excitation at later stages ( see @xcite ) . in the future , we plan to improve the model in various respects to take these deficiencies into account . </S>"
