    "a promising approach to making compact and high - q optical resonators is to base them on  totally internally reflected \" modes of dielectric micro - structures .",
    "such devices have received considerable attention as versatile components for integrated optics and for low threshold micron - scale semiconductor lasers@xcite .",
    "the interest in such resonators for applications and for fundamental optical physics has motivated the extension of optical resonator theory to describe such systems .",
    "all optical resonators are open systems described by modes characterized by both a central frequency and a width ( their ratio giving the q - factor of the mode ) . in a mirror - based resonator",
    "the set of resonant frequencies is determined by an optical path - length for one round - trip along a path determined by the mirrors within the resonator ; the width is determined by the reflectivity of the mirrors , diffraction at the mirror edges and by absorption loss within the resonator .",
    "accurate analytic formulas can be found for the resonator frequencies and for the electric field distribution of each mode using the methods of gaussian optics@xcite .",
    "the modes are characterized by one longitudinal and two transverse mode indices ( in three dimensions ) .",
    "these mode indices play the same role mathematically for the electromagnetic wave equation as the good quantum numbers play in characterizing solutions of the wave equation of quantum mechanics .    for fabricating optical resonators on the micron scale , using total internal reflection from a dielectric interface for optical confinement",
    "is convenient as it simplifies the process .",
    "such dielectric resonators define no specific optical path length ; many different and potentially non - closed ray trajectories can be confined within the resonator .",
    "an important point , emphasized in the current work , is that in such resonators there typically exist many narrow resonances characterized by their frequency and width , but such resonances often can not be characterized by any further modes indices .",
    "this is the analog of a quantum system in which there are no good quantum numbers except for the energy .",
    "we shall see that the way to determine if a given mode has additional mode indices ( other than the frequency ) , is to determine whether it corresponds to regular or chaotic ray motion .",
    "we will present below an efficient numerical method for calculating all of the resonances of a large class of dielectric resonators ; we will also describe the surface of section and husimi - wigner projection method to determine the ray dynamics corresponding to such a mode .",
    "although both dbr - based and edge - emitting optical resonators rely on reflectivity from a dielectric interface ( at normal incidence ) , we will use the term dielectric resonator ( dr ) to refer to resonators that rely on the high reflectivity of dielectric bodies to radiation incident from within the dielectric near the critical angle for total internal reflection .",
    "this is the only class of resonators we will treat below .",
    "we immediately point out that totally - internally - reflected solutions of the wave equation only exist for infinite flat dielectric interfaces ; any curvature or finite extent of the dielectric will allow evanescent leakage of propagating radiation from the optically more dense to the less dense medium . as a dielectric resonator is a finite dielectric body embedded in air ( or in a lower index medium ) it will of necessity allow some evanescent leakage of all modes , even those which from ray analysis appear to be totally - internally reflected .    a very large range of shapes for drs have been studied during the recent years . by far",
    "the most widely studied are rotationally symmetric structures such as spheres , cylinders and disks .",
    "the reason for this is that the wave equation is separable and the solutions can be written in terms of special functions carrying three modes indices .",
    "the narrow ( long - lived ) resonances correspond to ray trajectories circling around the symmetry axis near the boundary with angle of incidence above total internal reflection ; these solutions are often referred to as  whispering gallery \" ( wg ) modes or morphology - dependent resonances . in this case , due to the separability of the problem , it is straightforward to evaluate the violation of total internal reflection , which may be interpreted as the tunneling of waves through the angular momentum barrier@xcite .",
    "micron - scale , high - q micro - lasers were fabricated in mid-80s and early 90s based on such cylindrical @xcite ( disk - shaped ) ( @xmath0 ) and spherical@xcite ( @xmath1 ) dielectric resonators .",
    "however , the very high q value makes these resonators unsuitable for micro - laser applications , because such lasers invariably provide low - output power and furthermore , unless additional guiding elements are used , the lasing output is emitted isotropically .",
    "as early as 1994@xcite one of the current authors proposed to study dielectric resonators based on smooth deformations of cylinders or spheres which were referred to as  asymmetric resonant cavities \" ( arcs ) .",
    "the idea was to attempt to combine the high q provided by near total internal reflection with a breaking of rotational symmetry leading to directional emission and improved output coupling .",
    "general principles of non - linear dynamics applied to the ray motion ( to be reviewed below ) suggested that there would be only a gradual degradation of the high - q modes , and one might be able to obtain directional emission from deformed whispering gallery modes . experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite work since that initial suggestion has confirmed this idea , although the important modes are not always of the whispering gallery type@xcite .",
    "calculating the modal properties of deformed cylindrical and spherical resonators presents a much more challenging theoretical problem .",
    "unless the boundary of the resonator corresponds to a constant coordinate surface of some orthogonal coordinate system , the resulting partial differential equation will not be solvable by separation of variables .",
    "the only relevant separable case is an exactly elliptical deformation of the boundary , which turns out to be unrepresentative of generic smooth deformations .",
    "using perturbation theory to evaluate the new modes based on those of the cylindrical or spherical case is also impractical , as for interesting deformations and typical resonator dimensions ( tens of microns or larger ) the effect of the deformation is too large for the modes of interest to be treated by perturbation theory .",
    "the small parameter in the problem for attempting approximate solutions is the ratio of the wavelength to the perimeter @xmath2 .",
    "eikonal methods@xcite and gaussian optical methods@xcite both rely on the short wavelength limit to find approximate solutions .",
    "the gaussian optical method can be used to find a subset of the solutions for generic arcs , those associated with stable periodic ray orbits , as explained in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "the eikonal method can also be used to find a subset of the modes of arcs , if one has a good approximate expression for a local constant of motion ; an example of this is the adiabatic approximation used by nckel and stone@xcite .",
    "however a large fraction of the modes in arcs are not describable by either of these methods .",
    "the breakdown of the gaussian optical methods is easily seen as a fully chaotic system will have only unstable periodic orbits and the solutions one obtains by the gaussian method near unstable periodic ray orbits are inconsistent@xcite .",
    "the failure of eikonal methods is more subtle and really arises from the possibility of chaotic ray motion in a finite fraction of the phase space .",
    "often optics textbooks and even standard research references treat the eikonal method as being of completely general applicability ; we therefore will devote the next section of this paper to an explanation of the failure of eikonal methods for resonators with arbitrary smooth boundaries . in section  ( [ sect_refbilliard ] )",
    "we describe the phase space methods which indicate that this failure is generic .",
    "in section  ( [ sect_resprob ] ) we present the formulation of the resonance problem and in section  ( [ sect_wavereduct ] ) the reduction of the maxwell s equations to the helmholtz equation for the resonators we study .",
    "the failure of all standard short wavelength approximation methods to describe the solution of wave equations in finite domains with arbitrary smooth boundaries has led to the problem of  quantizing chaos \" in the context of the schrdinger equation and the helmholtz equation ( although our problem is somewhat different due to the dielectric boundary conditions on this equation ) .",
    "although substantial progress has been made using periodic orbit methods in obtaining approximations for the density of states of fully chaotic systems , these methods do not yield individual solutions of the wave equation .",
    "it is therefore of great importance in this field to develop efficient numerical methods which can be used to calculate and interpret the resonance properties . in section  ( [ sect_scatquant1 ] )",
    "we present a highly efficient numerical method for arcs , adapted from the s - matrix methods developed in the field of quantum chaos . in section  ( [ sect_rootsearch ] )",
    "we display a range of resonant solutions for a partially chaotic dielectric resonator and in section  ( [ sect_husimi ] ) we show how to perform the husimi projection of the real - space numerical solutions so obtained into phase space in order to interpret them in terms of ray dynamics . the calculation of experimental observable relating to emission patterns from micro - lasers are discussed in section  ( [ sect_ff ] ) . finally , in section  ( [ sect_qbm ] ) , we show examples of the main types of modes one encounters in wave - chaotic dielectric resonators generally and specifically in arcs .",
    "the use of classical ray theory to describe monochromatic , high - frequency solutions of the wave equation is described in various references@xcite .",
    "the connection between rays and waves is standardly derived in the context of the helmholtz equation ( ^2 + n^2()k^2 ) ( ) = 0 ; [ hheqintro ] the wave equation for the resonator problem will be reduced to this equation in section  ( [ sect_wavereduct ] ) .",

    ". we will also specialize to a uniform medium of dielectric constant @xmath7 . in this framework",
    ", each wave solution @xmath8 corresponds to a _ family of rays _ defined by the vector field ( ) = s ( ) where the field has a fixed magnitude , @xmath9 .",
    "the solution for the function @xmath10 can be found by the specification of initial value boundary conditions on an open curve @xmath11 and propagating the curve using the eikonal equation .",
    "such an initial value solution can thus be extended until it encounters a point at which two or more distinct rays of the wavefront converge ; at or nearby such a point will occur a focus or caustic at which the amplitude @xmath12 will diverge and in the neighborhood of which the asymptotic representation becomes ill - defined .",
    "( a caustic is a curve to which all the rays of a wavefront are tangent ; if the curve degenerates to a point it is a focus@xcite ) .",
    "this causes only a local breakdown of the method and can be handled by a number of methods . at a distance",
    "much greater than a wavelength away from the caustic the solutions are still a good approximation to the true solution of the initial value problem .    in contrast , to find asymptotic solutions on a bounded domain @xmath13 with boundary value conditions , one must introduce more than one eikonal at each order in the asymptotic expansion .",
    "we will illustrate the important points here with dirichlet boundary conditions on the boundary @xmath14 .",
    "however the basic argument holds for any linear homogeneous boundary conditions and , with minor modifications , for the matching conditions relevant for uniform dielectric resonators of index of refraction @xmath7 with boundary shape @xmath14 , within an infinite medium of index @xmath15 . for the discussion of dirichlet boundary conditions we will set the index @xmath15 for convenience within the domain @xmath13 . the leading order in the asymptotic expansion of the solution takes the form ( ) = _",
    "m=1^n a_m ( ) [ introuscansatz ] with @xmath16 .",
    "it is easily checked that there must be more than one term ( eikonal ) in the solution in order to have a non - trivial solution ; if there were only one term in the expression for @xmath17 then any solution which vanished on the boundary would vanish identically in @xmath13 due to the form of the transport equation .",
    "the question we now address is the following . for what boundary shapes @xmath14 in two dimensions",
    "do there exist approximate solutions of the form eq .",
    "( [ introuscansatz ] ) which are valid everywhere in @xmath13 except in the neighborhood of caustics ( which are a set of measure zero ) ?",
    "first we note that with dirichlet boundary conditions we have a hermitian eigenvalue problem and so we know that solutions will only exist at a discrete set of real wavevectors @xmath18 . in the eikonal theory",
    "the quantization condition for @xmath18 arises from the requirement of single - valuedness of @xmath17 and will be reviewed briefly below . here",
    "our primary goal is to show that the existence of eikonal solutions to the boundary value problem is intimately tied to the nature of the ray dynamics within the region @xmath13 .",
    "moreover for the case of fully chaotic ray dynamics this connection shows that eikonal solutions _ do not exist_. we will prove this latter statement by showing a contradiction follows from assuming the existence of eikonal solutions in the chaotic case . this argument will be a  physicist s proof \" without excessive attention to full mathematical rigor .",
    "the proposed solution for @xmath17 posits the existence of @xmath19 scalar functions @xmath20 each of which satisfy the eikonal equation , @xmath21 and which , while themselves not single - valued on the domain @xmath13 , allow the construction of single - valued functions @xmath17 and @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , for the asymptotic expansion to be well - defined , the  rapid variation \" in @xmath17 must come from the largeness of @xmath18 ; i.e.  to define a meaningful asymptotic expansion in which terms are balanced at each order in @xmath18 the functions @xmath23 can not vary too rapidly in space . from the eikonal equation itself we know that @xmath24 , but we must also have that the curvature @xmath25 for the asymptotic solution to be accurate .",
    "this condition fails within a wavelength of a caustic , as one can check explicitly , e.g.  for the case of a circular domain @xmath13 ; but for a solvable case like the circle it holds everywhere else in @xmath13 .",
    "it is convenient for our current argument to focus on @xmath26 , instead of @xmath27 itself .",
    "consider an arbitrary point @xmath28 in @xmath13 where @xmath29 ; to leading order in @xmath18 and away from caustics ( _ 0)= ik _",

    "[ gradpsi ] the @xmath19 unit vectors @xmath30 define @xmath19 directions at @xmath28 which are the directions of rays passing through @xmath28 in the stationary solution .",
    "an important point is that due to the condition on the curvature just noted , these directions are constant at least within a neighborhood of linear dimension @xmath31 around @xmath28 .",
    "choose one of the ray directions , call it @xmath32 and follow the gradient field @xmath33 to the boundary @xmath13 .",
    "for a medium of uniform index ( as we have assumed ) the vector @xmath33 is strictly constant in both direction and magnitude along a ray .",
    "thus one can find the direction of @xmath33 at the boundary and calculate its `` angle of incidence '' , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the normal to the boundary at the point of intersection .",
    "the condition @xmath36 on the boundary implies that there is a second term with the eikonal @xmath37 in the sum , which satisfies @xmath38 and @xmath39 on the boundary . as a result tangent derivatives of @xmath40 on the boundary are also equal and together with eq .",
    "( [ eqeikonal ] ) , this implies that for a non - trivial solution @xmath41 . in other words",
    "a ray of the eikonal @xmath42 must specularly reflect at the boundary into a ray of another eikonal in the sum , which we label @xmath37 .",
    "hence we know the direction of @xmath43 at the boundary and can follow it until the next `` reflection '' from the boundary .",
    "thus each segment of a ray trajectory corresponds to a direction of @xmath44 for some @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ gradpsi ] ) .",
    "a ray moving linearly in a domain @xmath13 and specularly reflecting from the boundary describes exactly the same dynamics as a point mass moving on a frictionless `` billiard '' table with boundary walls of shape @xmath14 .",
    "such dynamical billiards have been studied since birkhoff in the 1920 s as simple dynamical systems which can and typically do exhibit chaotic motion .",
    "thus the problem of predicting the properties of the vector fields @xmath46 is identical to the problem of the long - time behavior of dynamical billiards .",
    "one property of any such bounded dynamical system ( independent of whether it displays chaos ) is that any trajectory starting from a point @xmath28 will return to a neighborhood of that point an infinite number of times as @xmath47 ( the poincar recurrence theorem@xcite ) .",
    "therefore we are guaranteed that the ray we followed from @xmath28 in the direction @xmath48 will eventually re - enter the neighborhood of size @xmath49 around @xmath28 . by our previous argument",
    ", each linear segment of the ray trajectory , corresponds to one of the directions @xmath44 and thus when the ray re - enters the neighborhood of @xmath28 for @xmath26 to be single valued it is necessary that the ray travel in one of the directions @xmath50 .",
    "there can be two categories of ray dynamics : 1 )  although the ray enters the neighborhood of @xmath28 an infinite number of times it only does so in a finite number , @xmath19 of ray directions .",
    "2 )  the number of ray directions grows monotonically with time and tends to infinity as @xmath47 .",
    "we will now show that the general applicability of the eikonal method depends on which category of ray motion occurs .",
    "let us first consider a billiard @xmath14 with fully chaotic dynamics . in the current context",
    "`` fully chaotic '' means that for arbitrary choice of @xmath28 and the direction @xmath48 ( except for sets of measure zero , such as unstable periodic orbits ) the distribution of return directions ( momenta ) is continuous and isotropic as @xmath47 .",
    "therefore the number of terms in an eikonal solution of the form eq .",
    "( [ introuscansatz ] ) would have to be infinite , contradicting our initial assumption that @xmath19 was finite .",
    "thus there do not exist eikonal solutions with finite @xmath19 for wave equations on domains with fully chaotic ray dynamics .",
    "a very closely related point was made by einstein as early as 1917@xcite ( he phrased it as the non - existence of a multi - valued vector field defined by the @xmath19  sheets \" of the functions @xmath46 ) .",
    "one may ask whether an eikonal solution with an infinite number of terms could be defined ; this appears unlikely as the amplitudes for the wavefronts are bounded below by @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the typical linear dimension of @xmath13 , so that only a very special phase relationship between terms would allow such a sum to converge .",
    "the essential physics of this breakdown of the eikonal method is that in a chaotic system wave solutions exist but do not have wavefronts which are straight on a scale much larger than a wavelength , hence it is impossible to develop a sensible asymptotic expansion with smooth functions @xmath46 .",
    "returning now to the case of a boundary @xmath14 for which the distribution of return momenta is always discrete , this means that there exist exactly @xmath19 ray directions for each point @xmath28 and any choice of @xmath48 . in this case",
    "the entire spectrum of the wave equation on @xmath14 can be obtained by an eikonal approximation with @xmath19 terms of the form eq .",
    "( [ introuscansatz ] ) .",
    "the quantized values of @xmath18 are determined by the conditions that the eikonal only advance in phase by an integer multiple @xmath53 upon each return to @xmath28 and hence the solution is single - valued .",
    "the correct quantization condition must take into account phase shifts which occurs for rays as they pass caustics .",
    "the details of implementing this condition have become know as einstein - brillouin - keller quantization@xcite .    from modern studies of billiard dynamics we know that both of the cases we have just considered are exceptional .",
    "the billiards for which eikonal solutions for the entire spectrum is possible are called integrable , and their ray dynamics has one global constant of motion for each degree of freedom .",
    "for example in the circular billiard both angular momentum and energy are conserved and for each choice of @xmath28 and direction @xmath48 there are exactly two return directions@xcite ( see fig .  [ figcirclepqp ] ) .",
    "while the circle is a good and relevant example here , there are other shapes , such as rectangles and equilateral triangles for which the method also works ; obviously these are shapes of very high symmetry .",
    "it is also known that an elliptical billiard of any eccentricity is integrable ; however this is believed to be the only integrable smooth deformation of a circle@xcite .",
    "thus there is a relatively small class of boundaries for which eikonal methods work globally ; this point does not seem to be widely appreciated in the optics community .",
    "as already noted , the type of boundary shape which generates continuous return distributions for each choice of @xmath28 and direction @xmath48 correspond to completely chaotic billiards and such shapes are also quite rare .",
    "no smooth boundary ( i.e.  @xmath14 for which all derivatives exist ) is known to be of this type .",
    "a well - known and relevant example for us of such a shape is the stadium billiard , consisting of two semi - circular `` endcaps '' connected by straight sides .",
    "note that the generation of continuous return distributions would fail for a point @xmath28 between the two straight walls if we chose @xmath48 perpendicular to the walls generating a ( marginally stable ) two - bounce periodic orbit passing through @xmath28 .",
    "however this choice represents a set of measure zero of the initial conditions in the phase space .",
    "it follows from our above arguments that eikonal methods would fail for the entire spectrum in such a billiard ( except a set of measure zero in the short wavelength limit ) .",
    "the generic dynamics of billiards arises when the boundary is smooth but there is not a second global constant of motion ; this is exemplified by the quadrupole billiard we study extensively below ( see definition in eq .",
    "( [ quad ] ) ) .",
    "such a billiard has `` mixed '' dynamics ; we shall explain what this means and how it is studied in more detail below .",
    "for such a billiard , depending on the choice of the initial phase space point @xmath54 , one may get either a finite number @xmath19 of return directions or an infinite number as @xmath47 .",
    "it is not obvious just from our above arguments that this means that eikonal methods will fail in such a case",
    ". we will skip over this point and simply state that in the case of mixed dynamics in principle only a finite fraction of the spectrum could be calculated by eikonal methods . if one can obtain a relatively tractable expression for the locally - conserved quantity which leads to a finite number of return directions @xmath19 , as in the adiabatic approximation of berry and robnik@xcite , then some progress can be made@xcite . however in practice the vector fields @xmath44 required are usually too complicated to make such an approach tractable .",
    "thus in practice eikonal methods are not very useful to find solutions of the helmholtz equation for generic shapes . a related but different analytic method , that of gaussian optics , can be used to calculate a fraction of the spectrum based on motion near stable periodic orbits .",
    "this method is worked out for dielectric billiards with mixed dynamics in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "however both this and the eikonal method fail for a fraction of the spectrum which approaches unity as the chaotic fraction of phase space approaches unity .",
    "since the traditional analytic methods of optics fail for these systems , what other short wavelength approaches exist ?",
    "the development of short wavelength approximations for mixed and chaotic systems is precisely the problem of quantum chaos which has been widely studied in atomic , nuclear , solid - state and mathematical physics over the past two decades@xcite .",
    "powerful analytic methods have been developed , but with an essentially different character than eikonal or gaussian methods ( these techniques are typically referred to as _ semiclassical methods _ in the quantum chaos literature ) .",
    "the analytic methods in quantum chaos theory are all of a statistical character and do not allow one to calculate individual modes .",
    "instead the methods focus on the fluctuating part of the density of modes and the statistical properties of the spectrum ( e.g.  level - spacing distributions ) .",
    "the results are useful in many contexts , but less useful in the context of optical resonators and micro - lasers for which a single or small set of modes will be selected and one is interested in their emission patterns and q - values .",
    "therefore it is particularly important to develop efficient numerical methods for calculating the spectrum and modes of such dielectric resonators , and we will discuss our method for doing this in section  ( [ sect_scatquant1 ] ) below .",
    "we are primarily interested in arc resonators with mixed billiard dynamics as these shapes lead to resonances with high q and directional emission . for such resonators ,",
    "the ray phase space is not fully chaotic , but is highly structured .",
    "moreover the possibility of ray escape decreases the randomizing effect of chaotic motion at @xmath47 . therefore using methods which maintain a connection between the wave solutions and the ray phase space is very helpful .",
    "we shall describe such a method , known as husimi projection , in section  ( [ sect_husimi ] ) below .",
    "before introducing our numerical method and the husimi projection method , we review the properties of mixed phase space via the surface of section method in the context of the quadrupole billiard / arc .",
    "this billiard is described by the boundary shape : r ( ) = r_0(1 + 2 ) [ quad ] which in the zero deformation limit @xmath55 reduces to a circular billiard , which as we have already noted , is integrable .",
    "therefore the variation of the parameter @xmath56 starting from zero induces a transition to chaos . as the perturbation is smooth ,",
    "various results in dynamical systems ( collectively known as kolmogorov - arnold - moser theory ) imply that the transition to chaos is gradual@xcite",

    "we treat the ideal perfectly - reflecting billiard ; later we will discuss the role of ray escape in arcs .    ) and the angle of incidence with respect to the local outward pointing normal ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "for a standary dynamical billiard there is perfect specular reflection and no escape . for  dielectric billiards \" if @xmath58 , total internal reflection takes place , but both refraction and reflection according to fresnel s law results when a bounce point ( bounce # 4 in the figure ) falls below the  critical line \" ( shown in red ) @xmath59 .",
    "note that @xmath60 correspond to clockwise sense of circulation .",
    "we do not plot the @xmath60 region as the sos has reflection symmetry .",

    "when the shape is gradually deformed , it quickly becomes unfeasible to capture the types of ensuing ray motion by standard ray tracing methods in real space .",
    "a standard tool of non - linear dynamics , which proves to be very useful in disentangling the dynamical information , is the _ poincar surface of section _",
    "( sos)@xcite . in this two - dimensional phase - space representation , the internal ray motion is conveniently parametrized by recording the pair of numbers @xmath61 at each reflection @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the polar angle denoting the position of the @xmath62th reflection on the boundary and @xmath64 is the corresponding angle of incidence of the ray at that position ( see fig .  [ figdemosos ] ) .",
    "each initial point is then evolved in time through the iteration of the sos map @xmath65 , resulting in basically two general classes of distributions . if the iteration results in a one - dimensional distribution ( an _ invariant curve _ ) , the motion represented is _ regular_. on the other hand exploration of a two - dimensional region is the signature of _ chaotic _ motion .",
    "the transition to ray chaos in the quadrupole billiard is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figsoscol ] . at zero deformation",
    "the conservation of @xmath57 results in straight line trajectories throughout the sos and we have globally regular motion .",
    "these are the well - known whispering gallery ( wg ) orbits for @xmath66 . as the deformation is increased ( see fig .",
    "[ figsoscol ] ) chaotic motion appears ( the areas of scattered points in fig .  [ figsoscol ] ) and a given initial condition explores a larger range of values of @xmath67 .",
    "simultaneously , islands of stable motion emerge ( closed curves in fig .  [ figsoscol ] ) , but there also exist extended ",

    "as the transition to chaos ensues , a crucial role is played by the _ periodic orbits _ ( pos ) , which appear as fixed points of the sos map . the local structure of the islands and chaotic layers can be understood through the periodic orbits which they contain .",
    "thus , the center of each island contains a stable fixed point , and close to each stable fixed point the invariant curves form a family of rotated ellipses .",
    "the birkhoff fixed point theorem@xcite guarantees that each stable fixed point has an unstable partner , which resides on the intersection of separatrix curves surrounding the elliptic manifolds .",
    "chaotic motion sets in at separatrix regions first , and with increasing deformation pervades larger and larger regions of the sos . already at @xmath68 ,",
    "much of the phase space is chaotic and a typical initial condition in the chaotic sea explores a large range of @xmath57 , eventually reversing its sense of rotation .    .",

    "a dielectric resonator is significantly different from the closed ( dirichlet ) problem due to its openness .",

    "many of the physical properties of the modes within a given linewidth of the order of @xmath298 around @xmath225 are contained in the eigenvectors of the internal s - matrix at @xmath225 , and can be extracted without quantizing the mode ( i.e. without tuning @xmath18 to satisfy the boundary conditions ) . the quantized spectrum and the exact quasi - bound modes can be easily accessed by an extrapolation technique which requires only two diagonalizations of this s - matrix . in principle variants of this technique",
    "can be extended to very high wavevectors @xmath18 since it scales only the perimeter of the resonator .",
    "finally , we present a version of the husimi projection technique well - suited to dielectric resonators and show that the scattering eigenvectors as well as quasi - bound modes are structured by classical phase - space structures .    in conclusion , the methods and tools presented in this work provide a unified conceptual framework for treating dielectric resonators beyond the standard numerical approaches to such electromagnetic problems .",
    "we would like to thank evgenii narimanov and gregor hackenbroich for their contributions to the early phase of the development of the numerical method .",
    "we thank martin gutzwiller for making us aware of einstein s 1917 paper and for helpful discussions of its main point .",

    "ads would like to acknowledge support from nsf grant dmr-0084501 and phj lacknowledges support from the swiss national science foundation .",
    "although the development in the text using the eigenvalue problem for the truncated s - matrix @xmath134 is perfectly sound , its direct implementation is not very efficient .",
    "the numerical problems already surface at the stage of computing the truncated scattering matrix @xmath134 itself .",
    "the expression given in eq .",
    "( [ opensmatform ] ) requires numerical inversion of 5 matrices . at a given @xmath18 ,",
    "as the number of channels @xmath166 of the interior matrices designated by index @xmath299 grows beyond @xmath300 , they become increasingly more singular .    as evident from our previous discussion ,",
    "this ill - conditioning is caused by blindly including evanescent channels in the scattering problem .",
    "a quick solution is to truncate the matrices at the singularity boundary suggested by our ray interpretation and include only @xmath167\\!]$ ] channels of @xmath301 .",
    "but this turns out to produce some states which do not satisfy the boundary conditions well enough . as noted in@xcite , some of the evanescent channels @xmath165 have to be kept , enough to be able to proceed with our numerical computation and provide the missing ( evanescent ) components of those states which require it .",
    "thus , the properly truncated scattering matrix will have a size of @xmath302 .",
    "the conditioning of @xmath134 is highly sensitive to the choice of @xmath165 .",
    "singular value decomposition can be employed to calculate the inverses and build up @xmath134 . however , one way to sidestep this issue in favor of a more robust method is to trade the eigenvalue problem eq .",

    "we get both the inside and the outside vectors at one shot .",
    "this method turns out to be more stable than the one based on inversion , and yields good results with arbitrarily large @xmath165 .",
    "the numerical problems associated with the regions of evanescent behavior ( @xmath123 ) remain , but are tractable for @xmath305 ( this range is larger for modes without evanescent components ) .",
    "in the experimental imaging system , radiation emanating from the resonator is collected through an aperture and after passing through a lens , an image is recorded for a discrete number of angles in the farfield .",
    "the resonator is placed at the focal plane of the lens , so that the image is effectively formed at infinity .        just in front of the lens",

    "the lens effectively adds a quadratic phase , so that the field immediately behind the lens is given by ^(x ) = ( x ) p(x ) here @xmath308 is the _ pupil function _ , which takes care of the effect of the aperture , @xmath309 is the focal length of the lens and @xmath310 is the position on the lens . the field at the camera is given by propagating this field with the fresnel propagator@xcite , which is well - justified as the lens - camera distance is much larger than the wavelength _ ^ ( u ) = _ -^ dx ^(x ) using the expression eq .",

    "for instance , the points of brightest emission inferred from the imagefield might be shifted due to an `` optical mirage''-like effect ( see fig .  [",

    "the mirage is formed not because of a continuously varying index of refraction but a discontinuous interface .",
    "the imagefield has an interesting connection to the ( sos projected ) husimi distribution .",
