    "recent papers such as @xcite have shown a connection between dynkin games and optimal switching problems with two modes . in particular , letting @xmath0 denote the horizon , the results of @xcite show that the value process @xmath1 of a dynkin game in continuous time ( section  [ section : dynkingamesintro ] below ) exists and satisfies @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the respective value processes for the optimal switching problem with initial mode @xmath5 and @xmath6 . separately , the papers @xcite have shown how to construct two non - negative supermartingales that solve a dynkin game on a finite time horizon . furthermore , appropriate debut times of these supermartingales can be used to form a saddle point strategy for the game .",
    "it is therefore apparent that _ classical two - player _ dynkin games and two - mode optimal switching problems are strongly coupled in the following sense : starting with either the dynkin game or optimal switching problem , one can use its parameters and solution to formulate and solve the other problem .",
    "this paper complements these findings by proving , under appropriate conditions , that the solution to a two - mode optimal switching problem furnishes the existence of a saddle point for the corresponding dynkin game .",
    "this is accomplished by the method of snell envelopes which appears in @xcite for optimal switching problems on one hand , and in @xcite for dynkin games on the other hand . in the process",
