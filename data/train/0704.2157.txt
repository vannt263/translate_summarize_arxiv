    "the gravitational waves that we expect to observe in large detectors such as ligo @xcite , virgo @xcite , geo600 @xcite , tama300  @xcite and lisa @xcite , reflect the coherent evolution of the most compact part of the source mass distribution . from the observed waves we have the potential to infer the factors that govern that evolution .",
    "for example , the evolution of the collapsing stellar core in a type ii supernova is determined in part by the progenitor mass density and angular momentum distributions in the inner core .",
    "none of these properties of the progenitor can be directly determined from the electromagnetic radiation we observe when the shock emerges from the stellar envelope .",
    "in addition , the forces that govern the evolution of the core depend upon many things that are unknown , or poorly modeled , today ( for example , the matter equation of state , the role played by neutrinos and neutrino radiation transport , general relativity , convection and non - axisymmetry ) .",
    "the gravitational waves emitted during the collapse phase and its aftermath carry the signature of all these preconditions and the dynamics that govern both the collapse and subsequent rebound .",
    "reading that signature requires inferring the waveform from the noisy detector observations . here",
    ", we develop a new method for inferring the gravitational radiation waveform from the noisy data from two or more detectors , based on jaynes principle of maximum entropy @xcite , demonstrate its effectiveness when applied to the discovery of signals arising from simulated rotating iron core collapse buried in simulated detector noise , and show how the inferred waveform can be used , in principle , to gain insight into the properties of the source .    the first problem addressed in this study is the problem of inferring the gravitational wave signal from the data produced by the detectors , also referred to as the deconvolution or inverse problem .",
    "inverse problems generally have been long - recognized as a problem to be approached with great care ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the detector response , which relates the incident gravitational wave to the signal observed in the detector , is generally an ill - conditioned function ; additionally , the presence of additive noise generally confuses the observation .",
    "together , the noise and the ill - conditioned detector response generally thwart nave attempts at signal deconvolution .",
    "early attempts at gravitational wave signal deconvolution explored a least - squares or maximum likelihood approach to deconvolution : e.g. , @xcite developed a procedure for inferring a plane wave signal incident on a network of detectors with a frequency - independent response , in which case the problem response is well - conditioned .",
    "these techniques tend to over - fit the observations ; additionally , realistic detectors have frequency responses that are ill - conditioned and this complicates a least - squares or maximum likelihood approach to deconvolution .",
    "more recent efforts have explored regularized methods for inferring the incident gravitational radiation waveform @xcite . here , we use the _ maximum entropy _ principle to regularize the deconvolution problem , developing an application to the gravitational wave inference problem that is applicable in the general case of a frequency dependent and ill - conditioned detector response and avoids over - fitting the observations in the presence of additive detector noise .",
    "going beyond the problem of inferring the incident wave , we use the inferred waveform to explore how , and how well gravitational wave observations of this kind can be used to learn about the source .",
    "maximum entropy approaches to deconvolution have a long heritage in astronomical image reconstruction  , where they have been used in all wavebands .",
    "recent examples of the use of maximum entropy based methods include the reconstruction of the cosmic microwave background   including maps based on data from wmap  @xcite and cobe  .",
    "our work applies that heritage to the simpler problem of reconstructing the time - dependent plane wave signal incident on a network of gravitational wave detectors from their time series response .",
    "once we have inferred the incident signal , we are faced with a second problem of inferrence : identifying the properties of the source from the signal .",
    "one way of associating gravitational waveforms with supernova properties is to compare the inferred waveform with models arising from simulations that explore the signal dependency over a broad range of physical parameters .",
    "we should expect the inferred waveform to have the most in common with the simulated waveforms arising from models whose character is most similar to the actual source . here , we compare , using the cross - correlation , inferred waveforms with simulated waveforms arising from different rotating core collapse models .",
    "we assume that models whose signal shows the greatest correlation are the ones most likely to be similar to the source .",
    "section  [ sec : maxent ] describes in detail the development of the inference bayesian inference method that we have developed to identify the time - dependent gravitational wave signal incident on a network of detectors , ending with a demonstration of the method applied to simulated observations made at an idealized two - detector network .",
    "section  [ sec : application ] reviews the expected gravitational - wave emission processes in core - collapse supernovae and describes the recently produced catalog of rotating core - collapse waveforms by @xcite and the physics that went into the considered models .",
    "we use these simulated core - collapse signals to characterize how well our procedure for inferring the incident signal and characterizing the source works .",
    "finally , in   [ sec : conclude ] we summarize our conclusions and directions for further study .    one important goal with this paper is to connect the two communities of gravitational wave experimentalists and supernova modelers in a way that has not been done in the past .",
    "for this reason we have taken particular care to make the discussion of   [ sec : maxent ] pedagogical in nature .",
    "future gravitational wave models can be put through the pipeline established with this paper so that we can obtain more credible estimates of what might be possible with either initial or advanced ligo , virgo , geo600 , or tama300 , or with any combination of these , for any theoretical model .",
    "this has simply never been done for any collapse models , and is a novelty of this paper that we hope will stimulate further interactions between astrophysicists doing supernova simulations and the gravitational wave detection and data - analysis communities .",
    "the first problem faced in the analysis and interpretation of astronomical data is the identification of a signal in noisy observations . when the signal being sought takes a known form then special techniques , tuned to the characteristics of the signal , may be used ; however , the general problem remains the same : the first requirement is to identify the characteristics of the radiation @xmath0 incident on the detector(s ) that gives rise to the observational data @xmath1 .",
    "the data may be from a radio antenna , a spectrograph , or a network of gravitational wave detectors ; our goal may be to map of the radio emission from a distant agn , the emission spectra of an accretion disk , or the burst of gravitational waves associated with a core - collapse supernova . in the case of gravitational wave data , which is our principle interest in this paper ,",
    "the data @xmath1 are a set of time series corresponding to the sampled output of each detector , one time series from each detector in our network ; the radiation @xmath0 is the time dependent gravitational wave strain incident as a plane wave on the detector(s ) , which may be characterized ( for example ) by the direction of wave propagation and the time dependent strain amplitudes @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the two polarization states as measured at the earth s barycenter . restricting attention to linear detectors ( which is almost always the case and thus hardly a restriction at all ) the observations in each case are a linear superposition of a confounding noise and the incident radiation as filtered by the detector response function @xmath4 : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the convolution of the detector network response with the incident radiation and @xmath7 is the noise contribution to the observation @xmath1 .",
    "we generally know @xmath4 and the statistical properties @xmath8 of the noise @xmath7 ; with these our aim is to determine @xmath0 from @xmath1 .    in the absence of noise",
    "the solution to this problem appears , at first blush , to be straightforward : i.e. , we solve for @xmath0 the system of equations [ eq : d = rh+n ] with @xmath9 .",
    "problems arise when @xmath4 is not invertible , either because we have too much or two little data ( i.e. , the problem is over- or under - determined ) , or because the detector(s ) is ( are ) insensitive to some aspects of the signal @xmath0 ( e.g. , the detector can not distinguish between polarization states of @xmath0 , or is insensitive to signal energy outside of some band ) . in these cases",
    "we are forced to deal with uncertainty : if the data @xmath1 over - determine @xmath0 we must be prepared to resolve contradictions within the data ; if @xmath1 under - determine @xmath0 any conclusions we reach must be tempered by our incomplete knowledge of @xmath0 .",
    "these problems are only compounded when we consider the real case of noisy data . in real problems",
    "the response function @xmath4 is always ill - conditioned : i.e. , the response is not invertible ( the problem is over - determined ) , or not unique ( the problem is under - determined ) , or the solution @xmath0 to an equation of the form @xmath10 is sensitive to small perturbations in @xmath1 .",
    "sensitivity of @xmath0 to perturbations in @xmath1 presents a new twist : even when when the noise contribution to the observation @xmath1 is numerically small , it is dangerous to assume that @xmath11 is close to @xmath0 . finally , even in those cases where the response is invertible and",
    "well - conditioned , applying the inverse to @xmath1 does not distinguish between the signal @xmath0 and a `` signal equivalent noise '' @xmath12 .",
    "framing the problem of deconvolution in the language of bayesian inference provides guidance on how to proceed in determining @xmath0 . in a bayesian approach to the problem of inference",
    "we seek not @xmath0 , but a probability distribution @xmath13 the probability density @xmath14 , if we can find it , fully describes our legitimate knowledge  including uncertainty  regarding the waveform and its properties : e.g. , we can compute from it our expectation of the gravitational wave power incident on the detector , etc .",
    "it also provides a good point estimate of the incident radiation : i.e. , the @xmath15 that maximizes @xmath16 .",
    "we can report @xmath14 or , as is more generally the case , report some summary of the distribution @xmath14 : e.g. , the @xmath15 that maximizes @xmath14 and some suitably defined  error bars \" , which summarize the degree of our uncertainty .",
    "following bayes law , the probability distribution @xmath14 may be `` factored '' into the product of three other distributions :    [ eq : f ] @xmath17 where @xmath18    the probability @xmath19 is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "we can ignore it when our only goal is to find the @xmath0 that maximizes @xmath14 ; however , as we will see below , @xmath19 plays a vitally important role in helping us choose our prior @xmath20 . in the following subsections",
    "we describe how to compute @xmath14 by finding , in turn , of the probabilities @xmath21 , @xmath20 and @xmath19 .      focus attention",
    "first on the likelihood function @xmath22 .",
    "if the signal content of @xmath1 corresponds to incident gravitational radiation @xmath0 , then @xmath23 is just detector noise .",
    "correspondingly , the likelihood function @xmath24 is just the probability that @xmath23 is noise .",
    "how do we evaluate this probability ?",
    "gravitational wave detectors , interferometric or acoustic , measure a continuous quantity : i.e. , they are not particle detectors that count discrete events ( e.g. , photons ) .",
    "the statistical properties of the noise in these detectors is characterized by its power- and cross - spectral density or , equivalently , its mean and covariance @xcite .",
    "the principle of maximum entropy was introduced by @xcite as a means of identifying probability distributions whose `` information content '' is , in a well - defined and relevant way , consistent with this kind of a priori information but otherwise incorporates no other assumptions .",
    "it was first articulated in the context of statistical thermodynamics , where it provided a foundation for understanding the role of the gibbs ensemble and entropy maximization in statistical mechanics ; however , it is ultimately a logical statement about statistical inference and , as such , statistical thermodynamics is just one application of the principle of maximum entropy .",
    "the articulation of the principle of maximum entropy was made possible by the development of a theory of information and a ( recovered ) understanding that probability is a more general concept than `` relative frequency of occurrence '' .",
    "that a probability distribution embodies information is a relatively straightforward proposition to demonstrate .",
    "consider a physical system that can be in any one of several states and suppose that we can measure certain properties @xmath25 of the system whose values depend on  but do not necessarily determine  the system s state .",
    "for example , the system might be an @xmath26-dimensional quantum simple harmonic oscillator , whose state is determined by the @xmath26 quantum numbers @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and the observable might be the total energy of the system , @xmath31 .",
    "if we have no knowledge of the system s state then it is natural that we should regard it as equally likely that the system is in any particular state : i.e. , if we were to assign a number @xmath32 , @xmath33 , to represent our degree of certainty that the system s state is @xmath34 , with @xmath35 representing complete certainty that the system is not in state @xmath34 and @xmath36 representing complete certainty it is in state @xmath34 , then @xmath32 would be the same for all @xmath34 . now suppose that we measure or are told @xmath37 is equal to @xmath38 : what does this new information tell us about the state of the system ? in our example , we now know that only those states @xmath34 satisfying @xmath39 equal to @xmath40 are possible but that , among these , no @xmath34 is preferred over another : i.e. , the number @xmath32 we should ascribe to state @xmath34 vanishes if @xmath41 is not equal to @xmath38 and is equal to a constant for all other states . given this distribution we can express our expectations regarding other properties of the system : e.g. , our expectation that the property @xmath42 takes on the value @xmath43 is equal to the ratio of the number of states for which @xmath44 is equal to @xmath45 to the number of states for which @xmath37 is equal to @xmath38 .",
    "these numbers @xmath32 both represent our degree of certainty regarding the state of the system _ and _ satisfy exactly the same algebraic and relational laws that we require of probabilities @xcite ; so , we will hereafter refer to them as probabilities .",
    "in this demonstration we see that probability is more general than `` relative frequency of occurrence '' , that it does not require that we invoke an ensemble or make any assumptions regarding ergodicity  there is just one system and it is in a definite state  and that it represents in a meaningful way our state of knowledge about the system .",
    "modern information theory was launched in a series of papers by @xcite in which he gave a definite meaning to `` information content '' in the context of a probability distribution , described the properties that a measure of information should have , and showed that there exists a unique measure of the information content of a probability distribution , which is the negative of what is conventionally understood as the entropy of an ensemble .",
    "it is more common to refer to the negative of the information content as the measure of uncertainty , or ( information ) entropy : @xmath46 where the sum is over all states of the system . for a continuous distribution @xmath47",
    "the summation becomes an integral and we must normalize the probability as it occurs in the logarithm by the density of states @xmath48 : @xmath49    returning to our previous example , it is clear that there may be a large number of distributions @xmath50 that are consistent with the knowledge that the observed @xmath37 is equal to @xmath38 .",
    "each of these distributions has an entropy @xmath51 ; of these , one  call it @xmath52  will have the greatest entropy .",
    "we can find that distribution by finding the @xmath20 such that the variation @xmath53 , subject to the constraint that @xmath54 , vanishes :    @xmath55\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\sum_k\\left[-1 - \\log q_k + \\lambda_0\\right ] \\delta q_k\\\\ q_k & = & \\exp\\left(\\lambda_0 - 1\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the lagrange multiplier @xmath56 is chosen so that @xmath54 .",
    "the maximum entropy distribution @xmath52 assigns equal probability to every state @xmath34 such that @xmath41 is equal to @xmath38 : i.e. , @xmath52 is the distribution that embodies what we understand to be just the information that @xmath41 is equal to @xmath38 , but no more .",
    "the principle of maximum entropy states that this is always so : i.e. , given a system with possible states @xmath57 and constraints on the system in the form of functions of the state , the probability distribution @xmath58 that embodies just the information in those constraints is equal to the distribution that maximizes the entropy ( either equation [ eq : discreteentropy ] or [ eq : continuousentropy ] ) subject to the constraints .    we can use the maximum entropy principle to find the likelihood function @xmath21  i.e. , the probability distribution that @xmath23 is equal to detector noise given the characterization of the gravitational wave detector noise described by its mean @xmath37 and autocorrelation function @xmath59 :    [ eq : meanautocorr ] @xmath60    we can construct many example probability densities @xmath61 whose moments take on these values . from among these",
    "we desire the particular probability distribution @xmath62 that has maximum entropy : i.e. , we desire the distribution that has minimum information subject to the constraints that its moments satisfy equations [ eq : meanautocorr ] .",
    "this distribution satisfies the variational equation @xmath63\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are lagrange coefficients , which are chosen to insure that the probability is normalized ( @xmath56 ) , that the mean @xmath66 is @xmath37 ( @xmath64 ) , and that the auto - correlation @xmath67 takes on the value @xmath68 ( @xmath65 ) . solving equation",

    "adopting any other noise model makes additional ( and , since we know only @xmath37 and @xmath68 , unjustified ) assumptions .",
    "this important result is contrary to popular prejudice , which views gaussian noise models suspiciously even when nothing more is available for use in analysis than the noise mean and covariance .",
    "correspondingly , for the analysis of gravitational wave detector data we have @xmath77 where @xmath78 may be evaluated directly : i.e. , without the need to invert the generally ill - conditioned response @xmath4 .      when the observables @xmath1 over - determine the incident wave @xmath0 it is tempting to ignore @xmath79 in equation [ eq : f ] , minimize @xmath80 ( i.e. , maximize the likelihood ) over @xmath15 , and declare that @xmath15 is the inferred incident wave .",
    "this is , with minor variation , the approach taken by @xcite . while an entirely legitimate approach to deconvolution , maximum likelihood methods generally over - fit @xmath1 :",
    "i.e. , they find a @xmath15 that leaves a residual @xmath81 that is inconsistent with the known noise properties @xmath8 .",
    "one role played by @xmath79 is to resist this tendency toward over - fitting noisy data .",
    "one commonly thinks of the a priori probability @xmath79 as a representation of our general expectation signals @xmath0 prior to the particular observation @xmath1 .",
    "criticisms of bayesian analyses generally focus on the necessity of invoking a priori probabilities like @xmath20 .",
    "a great deal of intellectual energy has been devoted to developing ways of identifying a priori probabilities that are , in some meaningful sense , without prejudice .",
    "the maximum entropy principle , as described above , provides one means of doing so , which is especially useful when the set of system states is discrete or the density of states is known .",
    "another approach , also pioneered by @xcite , takes as its starting point the idea that the prior @xmath20 should be equivalent for equivalent experiments : more formally , that @xmath20 should be form - invariant under the same set of transformations that leave the experiment invariant .",
    "such priors encode only our knowledge of the experiment s nature and do not presuppose any outcome .",
    "we can use that principle in the present instance to find the class of priors @xmath20 that are the least presumptive regarding the signal @xmath0 .",
    "let us first focus on some general considerations that should govern the prior @xmath20 .",
    "writing @xmath0 as the sum of two time series , corresponding to the two polarizations @xmath82 and @xmath83 of an incident gravitational wave , we note that    * lacking any reason to presume that the source is oriented in a particular way relative to the detector line - of - sight , the prior should be invariant under an arbitrary rotation of @xmath84 into @xmath85 polarization ; * lacking any reason to presume that the gravitational wave burst arrives at a particular moment in time , the prior for @xmath86 and @xmath87 should be the same ; and , finally , * lacking any specific source model that dictates or suggests how energy is distributed throughout the burst , the prior should not favor waveforms with any particular degree of smoothness ( or autocorrelation or spectrum ) .",
    "we could , of course , introduce specific knowledge or assumptions into the construction of the prior , if we have any : for example , we may believe that the gravitational wave power should be concentrated in a band of frequencies , or that there is a relationship between the radiation in the @xmath84 and @xmath85 polarization states , etc . in the present instance , however , our goal is to specify a prior that makes the fewest possible assumptions ( beyond propagation direction , which we take to be known ) about the nature of the gravitational wave signal incident on our detector(s ) .    with these general considerations in mind",
    "we may write @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) in a fourier expansion : @xmath88 the prior on @xmath0 can just as well be expressed as a prior @xmath89 on the @xmath90 and @xmath91 . from our general considerations and the property of",
    "fourier series we conclude that @xmath92 i.e. , the overall prior is the product of priors of identical form evaluated for each of the coefficients @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "@xcite provides a particularly lucid derivation , which we reproduce here , of the prior @xmath95 that arises from the transformation group properties that we expect it should satisfy . to begin , we might just as well have written the fourier expansion of @xmath0 in terms of the fourier amplitudes @xmath96 and phases @xmath97 , as in @xmath98 with the @xmath99 related to the @xmath100 by    @xmath101    the same considerations that led us to factor @xmath102 into the product of identical functions @xmath95 of the @xmath93 and @xmath94 lead us to factor the prior @xmath103 into the product of priors @xmath104 of identical form , evaluated for each of the coefficient pairs @xmath105 : @xmath106 under the assumption that we do not know the signal arrival time all phases @xmath107 are equally likely : i.e. , @xmath108 the choice of fourier coordinates @xmath109 or @xmath105 does not affect our prior knowledge ; so , the prior distributions @xmath110 and @xmath111 must be equivalent : i.e. , @xmath112 in the special case where @xmath113 is equal to zero this relation becomes @xmath114 using this expression for @xmath115 in equation [ eq : pq ] we find that the desired prior @xmath95 must satisfy the functional equation @xmath116 which has the general solution @xmath117}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}\\ ] ] for some unknown parameter @xmath118 .",

    "nevertheless , our bayesian approach to inference is much more than a motivation for a particular choice of regularization function , or even for deconvolution via regularization .",
    "whereas deconvolution provides a single estimate of the signal @xmath0 , our bayesian approach provides a distribution @xmath14 , whose mode is the point estimate of the equivalent deconvolution problem but that also assigns a probability to any proposed @xmath15 .",
    "the availability of this distribution permits , among other things , a detailed error analysis for any problem where the details of the waveform play an important role .",
    "if we view the determination of @xmath0 from @xmath1 as a problem in deconvolution via regularization , then we require some prescription for the choice of regularization constant @xmath118 .",
    "viewed as a problem of bayesian inference , however , @xmath118 is not unlike any other unknown and we d prefer , instead , to find some probability distribution @xmath128 that describes the probability that @xmath118 is the appropriate choice and integrate the @xmath129 over @xmath130 to find a distribution @xmath20 independent of @xmath118 : i.e. , @xmath131 _ suppose we let the data guide us to a choice of @xmath128 : _",

    "figure [ fig : exampleresid ] shows @xmath170 , the residual after the inferred signal is subtracted from the observations . if we have done a good job of separating the signal and noise contributions to the observations @xmath1 than we expect that @xmath170 should be noise : in this example , unity rms white noise . in the cases @xmath161 equal to 1 or 2 inspection of the residuals shows no obvious evidence of structure left behind by the inference procedure . for the case",
    "@xmath161 equal to five and greater , where a clear signal is identified , the residual does show some evidence of structure near the location of the signal peak .",
    "the amplitude of this apparent structure is very much consistent with our assumptions about the detector noise ( i.e. , unity rms ) : it is only the time dependence of the structure that draws the attention of the eye .",

    "the problem of identifying a signal in noisy data can be approached as a problem of statistical inferrence : i.e. , we can find a probability distribution that describes the credibility that we should ascribe to the hypothesis that an arbitrary gravitational wave burst @xmath0 was incident on an array of detectors given observations @xmath1 .",
    "this probability distribution involves two components : the probability @xmath21 that @xmath23 is detector noise , and the a priori probability @xmath20 that a signal takes the form @xmath0 .",

    " something that is rarely , if ever , possible  the maximum entropy principle provides a means of selecting the probability @xmath21 that is simultaneously consistent with what is known about the noise and least presumptive about what is not .",
    "in particular , when the noise is characterized by its mean and covariance  the usual case  then @xmath21 takes the form of a normal distribution .",
    "the a priori probability density @xmath20 characterizes our prior expectations regarding signals @xmath0 . in the spirit of `` letting the data",

    "how well can we hope to characterize the astrophysics of core - collapse supernovae from the gravitational wave signature we observe ? the detailed astrophysics of core - collapse supernovae is uncertain , difficult to model , and involves large - scale convection and other stochastic processes .",

    "gravitational wave emission from core - collapse supernovae may arise from a multitude of processes , including rotating core collapse and core bounce ( e.g. , @xcite ) , postbounce convective overturn , anisotropic neutrino emission ( @xcite ) , nonaxisymmetric rotational instabilities of the protoneutron star ( @xcite ) , or from the recently proposed protoneutron star core g - mode oscillations ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition and in the context of the core - collapse supernova @xmath173 gamma - ray burst connection @xcite , late - time black hole formation in a failed or weak core - collapse supernova may accompany gravitational wave emission from quasi - normal ring - down modes of the newly - formed black hole .",
    "of all the above emission processes , rotating iron core collapse and bounce is the most extensively modeled and best quantitatively and qualitatively understood . for these reasons",

    "the gravitational wave signature extraction was performed using the newtonian quadrupole formalism ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the effects of rotation were investigated in  @xcite .",
    "the initial rotation of the progenitor was controlled by two parameters : the rotation parameter @xmath175 where @xmath176 and the differential rotation scale parameter @xmath177 , which is the distance from the rotational axis at which the rotational velocity drops to half that at the center .",

    "as a result , the transition from a supranuclear to a subnuclear bounce occurs for a lower value of @xmath175 .",

    "( very little is known concerning the cross - correlation in the noise of two separated detectors , other than that it is very small . )",
    "while we have chosen to make this demonstration with white noise , the maximum entropy analysis method introduced above naturally accommodates any noise covariance : cf . the paragraph including equation ( [ eq : pchisq ] ) . ]",

    "how well we can distinguish between different core collapse models we looked at how close a core collapse event would have needed to be for ligo , during its first four science runs ( s1 , s2 , s3 and s4 ) , to infer its waveform with reasonable accuracy . for this purpose",

    "figure  [ fig : scirun ] shows the maximum cross - correlation , for each of the first four science runs , between the inferred and actual waveforms as a function of the core collapse distance .",
    "there is a steady improvement , from s1 to s4 , in maximum entropy s ability to recover signals at greater distances , corresponding to improving detector sensitivity : by s4 , we are able to infer the gravitational waveform from core collapse events that occur as far as a few kpc away .",
    "the up - tick in cross - correlation at the 1  kpc mark in curve for s3 sensitivity is the result of a discontinuous change in the most probable waveform ( i.e. , a new extrema becoming the global maximum in the probability function . )",
    "the investigations described in the following sections , which delve into the source information present in the inferred signal , use the response and noise characteristic of the ligo s4 science run .",
    "an alternative way of expressing the results summarized in figure  [ fig : scirun ] is to describe the sensitivity required of a ligo - like detector to observe an optimally located supernovae to a given distance . under the `` white noise '' approximation made here , doubling the distance to which ligo is able to infer the waveform from a core collapse supernova requires doubling its sensitivity : i.e. , halving the rms noise amplitude at 100  hz . referenced to ligo s design sensitivity at 100  hz , which was achieved during ligo s s5 science run , and a 70% maximum cross - correlation , the maximum distance at which core collapse supernova are expected to be observable is @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the strain - equivalent noise power spectral density .",
    "the intermediate ligo upgrade underway at this writing is expected to reduce @xmath193 by a factor of four , and the advanced ligo upgrade that will follow will reduce @xmath193 by another factor of approximately 100 @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , we expect that advanced ligo will be capable of observing core - collapse supernovae like those modeled here at distances as great as 80  kpc : i.e. , beyond the distance to the lmc and smc , but far short of the virgo cluster .",
    "we can classify the models of  @xcite into those that bounce at supranuclear , subnuclear and transitional central densities .",
    "figure  [ fig : bouncetype ] shows the maximum cross - correlation between the inferred waveform , the actual waveform ( a supranuclear bounce type ) , and three other waveforms that each have , within their respective categories ( supernuclear , subnuclear and transitional ) , the greatest cross - correlation with the inferred waveform .",
    "( figure  [ fig : wave_bouncetype ] shows these four waveforms themselves , each with strain scaled to a distance of 10 kpc . ) it is clear that the inferred waveform has the most in common with that generated from a model with the same , supranuclear , bounce type and that , for s4 detector sensitivities , our ability to distinguish bounce type fails for core collapse events more than 3  kpc distant .    to facilitate comparison with signal - to - noise ratio sensitivities as reported by the ligo scientific collaboration for the ligo detectors ,",
    "we show the quantity `` @xmath194 '' , defined by    @xmath195    where @xmath196 is the _ actual _ waveform , running across the top of this and subsequent figures .",
    "the quantity @xmath194 can be compared to the single - detector , optimal orientation , expectation value of the power signal - to - noise ratio sensitivities reported by ligo in its publications : i.e. , assuming that the actual gravitational waveform were known , the expectation value of the signal - to - noise determined by matched filtering would be given by @xmath197 .",
    "figure  [ fig : mass ] shows the cross - correlation between the inferred and actual waveforms associated with core collapse models that differ by progenitor mass , but share the same rotational parameters .",
    "figure  [ fig : wave_mass ] shows the waveforms used for the cross - correlations .",
    "again , for s4 sensitivities the inferred waveform most closely resembles the waveform from the model with the same mass at distances up to 2 - 3  kpc .",
    "figure  [ fig : beta ] shows the cross - correlation between the inferred waveform , the actual waveform , and the waveforms associated with a set of models that differ only by rotation parameter @xmath175 , while figure [ fig : diffrot ] shows the cross - correlations for models that differ only by the differential rotation parameter @xmath177 ( cf .",
    "[ eq : a ] ) .",
    "figures  [ fig : wave_beta ] and  [ fig : wave_a ] show the waveforms for the set of models whose cross - correlations are shown in figures [ fig : beta ] and [ fig : diffrot ] .",
    "as expected , the cross - correlation decreases as the rotational parameters of the models depart from those associated with the actual waveform .",
    "we have described and demonstrated the use of a bayesian method , in the spirit of the so - called maximum entropy methods for analyzing astronomical image data , for inferring the time - dependent waveforms of the radiation incident on a network of gravitational wave detectors .",
    "in contrast to the methods developed for image analysis , which rely on the principle of maximum entropy to select an a priori probability for use in the bayesian analysis , we use the maxent principle to determine the appropriate choice of likelihood function for describing gravitational wave detector noise and use transformation group arguments to identify an appropriate , uninformative a priori probability density .",
    "we have demonstrated that the method described is quite capable of inferring the presence of signal in detector noise once the detector response to the signal begins to approach the noise rms , and very quickly converges on the correct signal amplitude and temporal structure of the incident signal as the actual signal amplitude increases .",
    "we have argued , based on the methods construction , a quantitative assessment of the correlation between the inferred and actual signal and the observed and expected signal - to - amplitudes associated of simulated data sets , and on a qualitative review of the residuals following subtraction of the detector networks response to the _ inferred _ signal from the observations themselves , that the method developed here is the best that one can expect to be able to do for detector networks whose noise character is known only via its power spectral density and for signals that are assumed to have arbitrary time dependence .",
    "inferring the gravitational wave signal incident on a set of detectors is but the first task of analysis .",
    "our ultimate goal is to use the inferred signal to understand the radiation source .",
    "we demonstrate how this might be done using gravitational wave signatures calculated from the rotating core collapse supernovae models of @xcite . using simulations drawn from",
    "@xcite we have generated simulated ligo observations of core collapse supernovae , used our bayesian analysis method to infer the most probable gravitational wave signal content of the data , and correlated this inferred signal with a wide range of signals drawn from the catalog of @xcite .",
    "we have found , in the context of this example , that at the signal - to - noise ratios expected to be used as a threshold for detection of core - collapse supernova burst events in ligo , the correlation is maximized when the inferred signal is matched against its parent from the @xcite catalog : thus , the analysis method we describe here infers the incident gravitational wave signal with enough fidelity to distinguish between models of different maximum central density , angular momentum , differential rotation , and progenitor mass .    to make the comparison between the inferred and model waveforms we used the maximum of the cross - correlation between the two , choosing the model whose maximum cross - correlation with the inferred waveform is the greatest .",
    "a bayesian treatment that assigns odds to different models given the inferred waveform is a natural next step ; however , we note that a bayesian treatment would involve the exponential of the cross - correlation function ( as opposed to the maximum cross - correlation ) marginalized over the lag",
    ". when the cross - correlation is a sharply peaked function , this will be proportional to the exponential of the maximum of the cross - correlation among the different models .",
    "thus , we conclude that the cross - correlation as we use it here is almost certainly likely to choose the same model as a more sophisticated bayesian analysis , except in those cases where the waveforms of the different models are nearly indistinguishable .",
    "while our example applications have been in terms of two interferometers , there is nothing in the description of the method that specifies the number of detectors and the application to three or more detectors is no different than for one or two detectors .",
    "the example application provided here involved just the two main ligo detectors ; however , we could just as well have augmented the analysis by including simulated data virgo , geo , tama and the operating bar detectors . for the particular simulations described here , adding any one of these detectors would most likely not improve our estimates of the signal since  for the examples presented here  we chose to place the source in the most favorable sky location and orientation for detection by the ligo hanford observatory ( lho ) site . for a source",
    "so positioned the strain amplitude in the ligo livingston detector is 89% of that for the lho detectors , while for the geo600 site detector it is 42% , 22% for tama300 , and 1% for virgo . on the other hand ,",
    "the addition of these other detectors to a real network would increase the overall sensitivity across the sky , as a source optimally oriented for virgo would , by reciprocity , be very poorly oriented for the lho detectors .",
    "gravitational wave astronomy is not yet a reality . nevertheless , with the detectors now operating and the enhancements currently underway ,",
    "it is only a matter of time before we have observations of from these instruments , from which we can gain insight into astronomical phenomena that are otherwise hidden from our sight .",
    "methods like those described here will allow us to move beyond gravitational wave detection and realize the full promise of gravitational wave astronomy .",
