    "here we relax the on - shell conditions and study some of possible subleading contributions with the minimal number of space - time derivatives in the component effective action .",
    "[ ht ]        we consider a supergraph given in fig.[f1 ] with two external hypermultiplet legs and with all propagators depending on the background @xmath0 vector multiplet .",
    "here the wavy line stands for the @xmath0 gauge superfield propagator and the solid external and internal lines stand for the background hypermultiplet superfields and quantum hypermultiplet propagator respectively . for simplicity we suppose that the background field is abelian and omit all group factors . the corresponding contribution to effective action",
    "looks like @xmath244 @xmath245 as usually , we extract the factor @xmath246 from the vector multiplet propagator for reconstructing the full @xmath0 measure .",
    "then we shrink a loop into a point by transferring the @xmath95 and @xmath247 from first @xmath248-function to another one and kill one integration . at this procedure",
    "the operator @xmath95 does not act on @xmath85 because we are interesting in the minimal number of space - time derivatives in the component form of the effective action . as a result ,",
    "one obtains @xmath249 @xmath250 further we use twice the relation ( [ polin ] ) allowing us to express the @xmath251 as a polynomial in powers of @xmath132 .",
    "then after multiplying the @xmath252 with the distribution @xmath253 we obtain a polynomial in @xmath132 containing the powers of this quantity from 5-th to 1-st .",
    "the first order is just a contribution of the type which we considered in the previous section , because one derivation @xmath254 is used for transformation @xmath132 into @xmath255 in the coincident limit .",
    "another @xmath256 transforms @xmath85 into @xmath257 .",
    "all that has been already done in section 4 .    here",
    "we consider the new contribution to the effective action containing term @xmath258 in the above polynomial : @xmath259@xmath260 the ellipsis means the terms with the powers of @xmath132 other then 2 .",
    "one can show that in the coincident limit they disappear . now transferring @xmath254 on @xmath258 we obtain the expression : @xmath261 where @xmath135 is defined in ( [ delt ] ) .",
    "let us consider each of the two underlined contributions separately .",
    "we use the representation @xmath262 where @xmath263 means the coincident limit @xmath264 .",
    "then we can apply a derivative expansion of the heat kernel .",
    "the goal is to collect the maximum possible number of factors of @xmath265 acting on @xmath266 and having the minimum order in @xmath216 in the integral over @xmath216 .",
    "higher orders in @xmath216 generate the higher spinor derivatives in the effective action .",
    "we take terms @xmath267 from @xmath135 and expand the exponential so as to find @xmath268 . the eq .",
    "( [ repr ] ) allows us to write the leading contribution to @xmath269 as follows @xmath270@xmath271 after trivial integration over p and s this contribution has the form @xmath272    now we fulfil the same manipulations with the second underlined contribution @xmath273 keeping the same order in @xmath216 and @xmath274 as in the expression ( [ gamma(1 ) ] ) .",
    "after that we see that the leading term of the form ( [ gamma(1 ) ] ) is absent in @xmath273 .",
    "then it is not difficult to show that the contribution ( [ gamma(1 ) ] ) is rewritten as follows [ we use @xmath275 @xmath276 the non - zero result arises when all @xmath277 - factors act only on the spinor delta - function .",
    "thus , the contribution under consideration is written as an integral over the measure @xmath278 which looks like `` @xmath279 - part '' of the full @xmath0 harmonic superspace measure @xmath280 .",
    "therefore , the hypermultiplet dependent effective action contains the term @xmath281 presence of such a term in the effective action for @xmath0 supersymmetric models in subleading order was proposed in @xcite .",
    "here we have shown how this term can be derived in the supersymmetric quantum field theory .",
    "it is interesting and instructive to find a component form of such a non - standard superfield action ( [ 3/4 ] ) .",
    "here we consider only a purely bosonic sector of ( [ 3/4 ] ) .",
    "after integration over anticommuting variables , which can be equivalently replaced by supercovariant derivatives evaluated at @xmath282 , we obtain a chern - simons - like contribution to the effective action containing three space - time derivatives @xmath283 this expression is the simplest contribution to the hypermultiplet dependent effective action beyond the on - shell conditions ( [ onsh ] ) for the background hypermultiplet .",
    "of course , there exist other , more complicated contributions including the hypermultiplet derivatives , they also can be calculated by the same method which led to ( [ 3/4 ] ) . here",
    "we only demonstrated a procedure which allows us to derive the contributions to the effective action in the form of integral over @xmath279 - part of the full @xmath0 harmonic superspace .",
    "we have studied the one - loop low - energy effective action in @xmath17 superconformal models .",
    "the models are formulated in harmonic superspace and their field content correspond to the finiteness condition ( [ fin ] ) .",
    "effective action depends on the background abelian @xmath0 vector multiplet superfield and background hypermultiplet superfields satisfying the special restrictions ( [ vacua ] ) , ( [ vac ] ) which define the vacuum structure of the models .",
    "the effective action is calculated on the base of the @xmath0 background field method for the background hypermultiplet on - shell ( [ onsh ] ) and beyond the on - shell conditions . for an on - shell",
    "hypermultiplet we found the universal expression for the effective active action .",
    "for hypermultiplet beyond on - shell , we calculated the special manifestly @xmath0 supersymmetric subleading contribution which is written as an integral over @xmath279 of the full @xmath0 harmonic superspace .",
    "we believe that such contributions deserves a special study .",
