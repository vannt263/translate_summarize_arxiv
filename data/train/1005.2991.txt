    "among the most motivated extensions of the standard model ( sm ) are those in which the gauge symmetries of the model are extended by at least one extra @xmath1 factor , probably , a remnant of unknown physics at higher energy scales . in fact , these sort of models arise , for example , in grand unified theories inspired , or not , in superstring , left - right models , and supersymmetric models  @xcite",
    ". an interesting feature of these models is the existence of extra neutral vector bosons , generically denoted by @xmath0 , which may be manifested at the tev scale , implying a rich phenomenology in the hadron and future lepton colliders  @xcite .",
    "these bosons appear also in models of dynamical symmetry breaking , little higgs models , models with extra dimensions , or even through the stueckelberg mechanism which avoids the higgs mechanism for generating the mass for the @xmath0 boson  @xcite .",
    "if they do exist they can be discovered at the lhc but this will only be the first step : next it will be necessary to discriminate the model that better fits all the measured parameters as its mass , its partial and total widths , and its couplings to the known fermions , etc",
    ". the detailed study of these properties can be done at a linear collider like the ilc .    concerning the quantum numbers related to the abelian factors , the options are numerous but some most motivated ones involve the baryon ( @xmath2 ) , total lepton ( @xmath3 ) , or lepton family ( @xmath4 ) , numbers , or combinations of some of them .",
    "however , it is still possible that they are related with an exotic charge ( @xmath5 ) . in particular , it is interesting that the extra local @xmath1 symmetry is related to @xmath6 since @xmath7 is an automatic global symmetry of the degrees of freedom of the sm i.  e. , without right - handed neutrinos and it is also anomalous  @xcite .",
    "it is possible to gauge this symmetry when an appropriate number of right - handed neutrinos is introduced , in order to make this symmetry anomaly free .",
    "moreover , the energy scale in which the new @xmath8 symmetry is broken is related to the generation of the light neutrino masses through the seesaw mechanism . the simplest way to implement @xmath6 as",
    "a gauge symmetry is by adding just an extra @xmath1 factor , which generator may , or may not , commute with the @xmath9 generators . in the first case , the electric charge operator has also a component on this factor , and in the second one , the electric charge operator is the same as in the sm , i.  e. , it has no component on the extra @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "we call the former sort of models  flipped \" , as the models in ref .",
    "@xcite , and  secluded \" models the latter ones  @xcite , and an example ( nonsupersymmetric ) is in ref .",
    "although usually this extra symmetry is related to a grand unified theory , from the phenomenological point of view , we can build models in this simplest way , independently of their origin , and study their properties in lepton or hadron colliders .    in general",
    ", the masses of the new neutral vector boson must be in the order of few tev , or be very weakly coupled to the known matter , in order to maintain consistency with the present phenomenology .",
    "this boson may be discovered at the lhc , but in order to study its respective parameters a linear leptonic collider , like the proposed ilc  @xcite , is better suited .",
    "below , we will show that the study of several asymmetries , on- and off- the @xmath0 peak , in this type of collider can be used to discriminate among the different models which have this extra neutral vector boson . among the most studied models in the literature are those based on the @xmath10 gut group and left - right symmetry groups  @xcite , and also those in which an extra @xmath7 factor is added , as those discussed above .",

    "<S> many extensions of the standard model predict the existence of extra neutral vector bosons , generically referred as @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this boson may be discovered at the lhc but in this case it will be necessary to study the respective parameters in order to discriminate to which model it belongs to . </S>",
    "<S> this is a task for a much clean lepton linear collider as the future ilc . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we develop an exemplary study of the capability of several asymmetries on and off @xmath0 peak in discriminating among those extensions with ( almost ) no ambiguities .    </S>",
