    "the rotation velocities of spiral galaxies can be accurately measured from the doppler effect . at large radii where the stellar surface brightness is falling exponentially ,",
    "velocities are obtained for clouds of neutral hydrogen using the 21 cm hyperfine line .",
    "the resulting ` rotation curves ' are found to be roughly flat out to the maximum observed radii of about 50 kpc , which implies an enclosed mass increasing linearly with radius .",
    "this mass profile is much more extended than the distribution of starlight , which typically converges within @xmath4 kpc ; thus , the galaxies are presumed to be surrounded by extended _",
    "halos _ of _ dark matter_.    perhaps the most compelling evidence for dark matter comes from clusters of galaxies .",
    "these are structures of about 1 mpc size containing more than 100 galaxies , representing an overdensity of about a factor 1000 relative to the mean galaxy density .",
    "it is assumed that they are gravitationally bound since the time for galaxies to cross the cluster lasts only about 10%  of the age of the universe .",
    "the cluster masses are determined in several independent ways : first , the virial theorem uses the radial velocities of individual galaxies as ` test particles ' .",
    "second , observations of hot gas at about @xmath5 k contained in the clusters , which is observed in x - rays via thermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "the gas temperature is derived from the x - ray spectrum , and the density profile from the map of the x - ray surface brightness . assuming the gas is pressure - supported against the gravitational potential leads to a mass profile for the cluster .",
    "the third method is gravitational lensing of background objects by the cluster potential .",
    "there are two regimes : the ` strong lensing ' regime at small radii , which leads to arcs and multiple images , and the weak lensing regime at large radii , which causes background galaxies to be preferentially stretched in the tangential direction .",
    "all three methods yield estimates for cluster masses @xcite which show that visible stars contribute only a few percent of the observed mass , and the hot x - ray gas only about 1020% , hence , clusters are dominated by dark matter .    on the largest scales ,",
    "there is further evidence for dark matter : ` streaming motions ' of galaxies ( e.g. , towards nearby superclusters such as the `` great attractor '' ) can be compared to maps of the galaxy density from redshift surveys @xcite to yield estimates of @xmath6 . here",
    "the theory is more straightforward since the density perturbations are still in the linear regime , but the observations are less secure .",
    "a similar estimate may be derived by comparing our galaxy s 600 km / s motion towards the virgo cluster relative to the cosmic rest frame , confirmed by the observed temperature dipole in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to connect the observed large - scale structure in the galaxy distribution with the results of the cmb anisotropies if the universe is dominated by non - baryonic dark matter .",
    "commonly , the present matter / energy density @xmath7 of the universe is decomposed into two components .",
    "there is accumulating evidence for @xmath8 and ( total ) matter density @xmath9 which implies a vacuum energy or _",
    "dimensionless cosmological constant _ of @xmath10 @xcite , cf .",
    "theories of inflation prefer a _ flat _ universe with @xmath11 as its most ` natural ' value ; this also requires _",
    "non - baryonic _ dark matter .      what are realistic candidates for dark matter ?",
    "hot gas appears to be excluded @xcite by limits on the compton distortion of the blackbody cmb spectrum ; atomic hydrogen due to 21 cm observations ; and ordinary stars by faint star counts .",
    "asteroids are very unlikely since stars do not process hydrogen into heavy elements very efficiently and hydrogen ` snowballs ' should evaporate or lead to excessive cratering on the moon .",
    "black holes more massive than @xmath12 @xmath1 would destroy small globular clusters by tidal effects .",
    "today s most viable dark matter candidates fall into two broad classes : astrophysical size objects called _ ma_ssive _ c_ompact _ h_alo _ o_bjects ( machos ) , and so - called _",
    "w_eakly _ i_nteracting _ m_assive _ p_articles ( wimps ) . actually these classes",
    "could possibly be interrelated , as we are going to show .",
    "several different objects belong to the first class : jupiter - size brown dwarfs consisting of hydrogen and helium less massive than 0.08 @xmath1 are the most prominent possibility . below this limit ,",
    "the central temperature is not sufficient in order to ignite hydrogen fusion , so these objects just radiate very weakly in the infrared due to gravitational contraction .",
    "other macho candidates include stellar remnants such as cool white dwarfs , neutron stars , and primordial black holes or as a result of a supernova .",
    "the wimp candidates are the invisible axion ( hypothesized to solve the strong cp problem or reemerging ` universally ' in _ effective string _",
    "lagrangians ) , one of the neutrinos ( provided it has a mass of about 10 ev ) , and the lightest supersymmetric particle , the neutralino , which is expected to be stable .",
    "all these have to have a very weak interaction , so that they could not be detected so far .",
    "the conclusion of _ gravitational microlensing _ of stars within the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) is that machos in the planetary mass range @xmath13 to 0.05 @xmath1 do not contribute a substantial fraction of the galactic dark halo .",
    "in the two - year data of the lmc events of the macho group 8 events could be detected which are well in excess of the predicted background of approximately 1.1 events arising from known stellar populations .",
    "hence , machos in a dark halo appear to be a natural explanation .    a statistical analysis of the _ galactic halo _",
    "via microlensing @xcite suggests that machos account for a significant part ( @xmath14 20% ) of the total halo mass of our galaxy .",
    "their most likely mass range seems to be in the range 0.3  0.8 @xmath1 , with an average mass of 0.5 @xmath1 , cf .",
    "if the bulge is more massive than the standard halo model assumes , the average macho mass @xcite will be somewhat lower at @xmath15 @xmath1 .",
    "this can be viewed as an indication that machos form an _ distinct _ large class of _ old objects _ that can not be easily extrapolated from any familiar stellar population , such as brown or white dwarfs .    however , there are some astrophysical difficulties with this interpretation , mainly arising from the estimated mass @xmath0 @xmath1 for the lenses .",
    "these can not be hydrogen - burning stars in the halo since such objects are limited to less than 3%  of the halo mass by deep star counts @xcite .",
    "modifying the halo model to slow down the lens velocities can reduce the implied lens mass somewhat , but probably not below the substellar limit 0.08 @xmath1 .",
    "old white dwarfs have about the right mass and can evade the direct - detection constraints , but it is difficult to form them with high efficiency , and there may be problems with overproduction of metals and overproduction of light at high redshifts from the luminous stars which were the progenitors of the white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "primordial black holes are a viable possibility , though one has to appeal to a coincidence to have them in a stellar mass range .    due to these difficulties of getting machos in the inferred mass range without violating other constraints , there have been a number of suggestions for explaining the lmc events without recourse to a dark population : most of these suggestions construct some non - standard distribution of ` ordinary ' stars along the lmc line of sight .",
    "however , these proposals appear somewhat contrived @xcite , but can be tested observationally in the near future .",
    "it has been recently suggested @xcite that machos could rather be _ primordial black holes _ formed during the early qcd epoch in the inflationary scenario . for cosmological dark matter , bound states of gravitational waves ,",
    "so - called ` gravitational geons ' built from spin2 bosons , are also considered recently @xcite .    since the standard model of elementary particles as well as",
    "their _ superstring _ extensions involve also higgs type scalar fields , we will analyze here the alternative possibility that primordial _",
    "boson stars _",
    "account for this non - baryonic part of dark matter @xcite .",
    "boson stars are descendants of the so - called _ geons _ of wheeler @xcite , except that they are built from scalar particles ( spin0 ) instead of electromagnetic fields , i.e.  spin1 bosons .",
    "if scalar fields exist in nature , such localized soliton - type configurations kept together by their self - generated gravitational field can form within einstein s general relativity .    in the case of _ complex _ scalar fields , an _ absolutely stable _ branch of such non - topological solitons with conserved particle number exists . in the spherically symmetric case , we have shown via catastrophe theory @xcite that these _ boson stars _ have a _",
