    "the instantaneous picture of the solution has much higher polymer density where the chains are located and pure solvents elsewhere , which is significantly different from the random - mixing picture envisioned in the f - h theory . for polymers in poor solvents , such localized density fluctuation takes the form of single - chain globules and multichain clusters@xcite . by accounting for the large localized fluctuation",
    ", we showed in previous work@xcite that the solubility of the polymer in the poor solvent is enhanced by several orders of magnitude relative to the prediction of the f - h theory  the logarithm of the solubility scales with @xmath8 rather than @xmath4 as predicted from the f - h theory .",

    "the coil - to - globule transition is a unique property of macromolecules that is different from the small molecules : even one macromolecule can form a mesoscopic phase@xcite .",

    "given that the f - h theory provides a poor description of polymers in poor solvent , on consideration of both the over - simplified physical picture in the theory and the demonstrated inconsistency with experiments and simulation , it is natural to question the validity of the @xmath1 value of @xmath0 predicted by the f - h theory .",

    "the value of @xmath13 is crucially important in polymer science and engineering , because it serves as the benchmark to categorize different polymer - solvent pairs .",

    "on the experimental side , there are ambiguities in the structure of single - chain globule .",
    "for example , by measuring the temperature dependence of the chain size for an isolated polymer in aqueous solution , wu and wang@xcite suggested that the chain conformation before the globule - to - coil transition involves two globule states : a _ fully - collapsed globule _ and a _ molten globule _",

    "the compaction of chain segments into a globule significantly reduces the polymer - solvent contact , which leads to enhancement of the solubility of polymer in poor solvent by several orders of magnitude compared to the prediction of the f - h theory as shown in our earlier paper@xcite .",
    "the governing equation for the phase equilibrium of polymers in poor solvent is given by eq 10 in sec iic . in eq 10a ,",
    "the osmotic pressure for long polymer chain in the dilute solution is very small ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "thus , from the similarity between eq 10a and eq 12 , we obtain for the volume fraction of the polymer - rich phase , @xmath134 on the other hand , based on our analysis of the globule structure in sec iii , the free energy of the single chain globule in eq 10b can be divided into the volume contribution and the surface contribution as @xmath135 .",
    "it can be shown that this definition is consistent with the definition based on the monomeric osmotic pressure across the interface used in ref .",
    "@xcite . by substituting @xmath136 in the form of eq 11 into eq 10b , and making use of eq 12 and eq 15",
    ", we obtain the relation between the equilibrium volume fraction of polymers in the dilute phase and the surface energy of the globule @xmath137 from which we identify the surface tension @xmath138 .",
    "@xmath139 is the surface area of the globule . noting that the natural dimension of the surface tension is @xmath140 ( @xmath114 is taken to be 1 ) , a dimensionless surface tension can be defined as @xmath141 which thus contains an overall @xmath142 dependence ; this is the origin of the @xmath142 in eqs .",
    "17a and 17b .",
    "eq 16 indicates that , the excess free energy of a globule is due to its surface energy , and not due to ( uniform ) mixing of polymer segments and solvents assumed in the f - h theory .",
    "equations 15 and 16 reveal the intrinsic connection between the macroscopic phase behavior of the polymer solution and the microscopic structure and property of the single globule .",

    "since this approach is based on finite polymer concentrations , it may be more easily conducted than the single - chain measurement .",
    "in this work , we have presented a theory that unifies the study of the single - chain structure and solution thermodynamics for polymers in poor solvents , using the language of the flory - huggins parameter .",
    "our theory captures the large localized density fluctuation in dilute polymer solutions and the change in chain conformation with the solvent quality that are missing in the f - h theory .",
    "the structure of a globule is studied by scft , which affords a more accurate description of the density profile of the globule and its free energy for finite chain lengths . by relaxing the assumption of the virial expansion of the local interaction as assumed in previous theories , our theory can be applied to globules with relatively high monomer density , which facilitates the calculation of the surface tension of the globule and the solubility of polymers in dilute solution for large values of @xmath0 .",
    "on the other hand , by avoiding the ground state dominance approximation , the scft is capable to describe globules with diffuse interfaces .",
    "these advantages allow us to study the globule structure and the thermodynamics of the globule melting in a unified theoretical framework .",
    "the chain - length dependence of the globule melting provides the essential information on the approach to the @xmath1 point .",
    "we briefly summarize the key new results of this work .",
    "first , we show that the chain conformation involves three globular states prior to the globule - to - coil transition : the _ fully - collapsed globule _",
    ", the _ swollen globule _ and the _ molten globule _ ; this identification clarifies the ambiguity in the experimental studies of the globule structure .",
    "second , we provide numerical verification of the universal behavior as a function of the scaling variable @xmath160 near the @xmath1 point , which has not been achieved by previous computer simulation in the globule state due to the limitation of the chain length .",
    "third , we provide new results for the solubility of the polymers in dilute solution compared to the results of des cloizeaux and jannink based on the f - h theory .",
    "the large @xmath0 result is completely new while the result near the @xmath1 point provides the missing numerical prefactor in previous work .",
    "fourth , we demonstrate the consistency of the @xmath1 points defined by the different criteria in the limit of infinite chain length : the disappearance of the second viral coefficient in the dilute polymer solution , the abrupt change in chain size from globule to coil and the critical point in the phase diagram of polymer solution .",
    "fifth , we find @xmath161 from all three different criteria , which _ coincides _ with the prediction of f - h theory .",
    "lastly , although the expression itself is known and widely used in the literature , we provide the explicit derivation that shows the effective two - body interaction in the _ single - chain hamiltonian _ is given by @xmath162 .",
    "although @xmath2 can be directly obtained through the viral expansion of the local hamiltonian if the polymer - solvent interaction is parameterized by the flory @xmath0 parameter , the two methods we present in this paper , that is tracking the chain - length dependence of the melting of the globule and tracking the chain - length dependence of the solubility of polymer solution , are more general approaches in determining the @xmath1 point .",
    "for example , the approaches can also be used for heteropolymers",
    ". moreover , the consistency of the @xmath1 point defined by the different criteria allows us to choose a convenient way to measure the @xmath1 point in experiment .",
    "our results suggest that the @xmath1 point can be determined by measuring the slope of @xmath163 versus @xmath8 for different temperatures , which is a finite - concentration instead of a single - chain measurement .",
