    "eta carinae , one of the most massive and most luminous stars in our galaxy , is famous for its great eruption about 170 years ago .",
    "its recovery has been unsteady with unexplained photometric and spectral changes in the 1890s and 1940s ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the spectral changes described in this paper may represent another rapid step in @xmath0  car s recovery from its great eruption .",
    "eta car has a complex spectroscopic cycle , most likely regulated by a companion star in an eccentric orbit ( @xcite , and many references in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "so - called spectroscopic events occur every 5.54 years since 1948 @xcite .",
    "the events are characterized by drastic changes in @xmath0  car s spectrum and photometry , e.g. , high - excitation emission lines disappear for a few months ( e.g. , ) and light curves at all wavelength regions show significant variations ( e.g. , ) .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we compared spectra at corresponding phases of successive spectroscopic cycles and found dramatic changes in observations after the 2009 event .",
    "days and @xmath1 mjd 50814.0 = j1998.00 , consistent with the eta carinae treasury program archive ( http://etacar.umn.edu/ ) .",
    "phases 0.00 , 1.00 , and 2.00 mark the 1998.0 , 2003.5 , and 2009.0 spectroscopic events . ]",
    "major stellar - wind emission features in the spectrum of @xmath0  car  had decreased by factors of order 2 relative to the continuum within 10 years and helium p cyg absorption had become stronger .",
    "most of the broad emission lines in @xmath0  car s spectrum originate in the primary star s wind , see many papers and refs .  in @xcite , and the simplest explanation for the observed spectral changes is a decrease in @xmath0  car s wind density , by a factor of 2 or more .",
    "the early exit from @xmath0  car s 2009 x - ray minimum and the observed decrease of the 210 kev photons over the last two cycles are consistent with this interpretation @xcite .",
    "in this paper we analyze spectra obtained between 1998 and 2011 with several instruments to investigate in detail spectral changes in @xmath0  car s wind .",
    "we are not concerned here with the temporary spectral changes observed during the events  the spectral changes discussed are of secular nature . in @xcite",
    "we noted only a few examples ; here we explore a wider range of effects , and whether or not they have developed gradually as opposed to sporadically .",
    "section [ sec : obs ] describes the observations . in section [ sec : change ] we confirm the observations made by @xcite and show that the broad stellar wind features were still weak in _ hst _ stis data obtained several months after our initial discovery in 2010 march data .",
    "the temporal progression of spectral changes and the dependence on the viewing direction is discussed .",
    "high - excitation emission and continuum from the nearby weigelt knots , which are thought to be photoionized by a hot companion star , reveal additional information . in section [ sec : massloss ]",
    "we discuss the implications of these observations and estimate the decrease in mass - loss rate over the last 10 years . in section [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we give a short summary .",
    "to investigate the long - term recovery of @xmath0  car  from its great eruption , we need quantitative spectra with consistent instrument characteristics , sampled over several years . unfortunately , no suitable data set exists prior to the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) observations .",
    "_ hst _ space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) observations in 19982004 and then again in 20092010 provide a consistent data set over a long time base - line . however , the stis instrument was not available in 20042009 , and the position fos4 in the southeast ( se ) lobe of the homunculus , 45 from the star , which shows the reflected pole - on spectrum was rarely observed with stis .",
    "we therefore supplemented the stis observations with ground - based data from the _ very large telescope _ ultraviolet and visual echelle spectrograph ( _ vlt _ uves ) , the _ gemini - south _ gemini multi - object spectrograph ( _ gemini _ gmos ) , the _ magellan ii _",
    "magellan inamori kyocera echelle ( _ magellan ii _ mike ) , the _ irne du pont _ boller & chivens spectrograph ( _ irne du pont _ b&c ) , and the _ 1.5 m cerro tololo interamerican observatory _ ritchey - chrtien spectrograph ( _ 1.5 m ctio _ rc ) .",
    "_ hst _ stis / ccd spectra obtained with the 52@xmath201 slit in combination with the g230 mb , g430 m , and g750 m gratings covered the wavelength region from @xmath3170010,000   with spectral resolution @xmath4 500010,000 .",
    "the observations include a variety of slit positions and orientations covering the entire homunculus nebula , with a concentration at position angles @xmath5 and @xmath6 where the star and the nearby ejecta , called weigelt knots b , c , and d , fall within the slit .",
    "the stis data were reduced with improved reduction techniques that were developed for the eta carinae hst treasury program @xcite .",
    "we extracted one - dimensional spectra with a sampling width of 013 using a mesa function @xcite at positions which were observed regularly ; the central star and the weigelt knots c and d.    _ gemini _ gmos spectra of the central object and fos4 obtained in 20072010 provide valuable supplemental and independent information . in most cases",
    ", we used the b1200 line grating at three tilt angles to cover the spectrum from @xmath337007500  .",
    "a 05-wide slit , oriented with a position angle of 160@xmath7 , was placed at different positions covering the star and fos4 .",
    "the resolving power was @xmath4 30006000 .",
    "the data reduction was done using the standard gmos data reduction pipeline in the gemini iraf package .",
    "the spectra were extracted using a mesa function 11 by 7 pixels wide , about 08 by 05 .",
    "the seeing was roughly 0515 , so each gmos spectrum discussed represents a region about 1 across .",
    "the spectra were rectified using a loess fit .",
    "unfortunately , the observations with _ gemini _ gmos do not cover an entire spectroscopic cycle . also , the important h@xmath8 emission is so bright in @xmath0  car  that it saturates the detector pixels even in the shortest available gmos exposures centered on the star .",
    "we therefore used observations obtained with the _ vlt _ uves instrument to examine in particular h@xmath8 from 2002 to 2009 .",
    "the uves observations are also extremely valuable because no other instrument covered the location at fos4 consistently over such an extended time period .",
    "eta car was observed with uves in the wavelength range from @xmath330008500   using 03 and 04-wide slits .",
    "the slits were oriented with constant slit position angle of 160@xmath7  and placed at two different positions covering the star and fos4 .",
    "the resolving power was @xmath4 80,000110,000 .",
    "the data were reduced with the standard uves pipeline available from eso .",
    "spectra were extracted using a mesa function 3 by 2 pixels wide , about 075 by 05 .",
    "the seeing was mostly between 05 to 15 , with an average seeing of 08 .",
    "the spatial resolution of the _ gemini _ gmos and _ vlt _ uves observations , limited by atmospheric seeing , is greatly inferior to _ hst _ stis spectra with spatial resolution better than 02 . in ground - based observations ,",
    "the inner ejecta are unavoidably mixed with the spectrum of the star , and include the weigelt knots 03 northwest of the star .",
    "fortunately , the slow - moving inner ejecta produce narrow emission lines which are distinguishable from the broad stellar wind lines .",
    "typical widths are of the order of 20 and 400 km s@xmath9 , respectively . at the wavelength region near @xmath104600  , which is of interest in our analysis ,",
    "the spectral resolution is about 40 km s@xmath9 for stis , roughly 75 km s@xmath9 for gmos , and the uves spectra have a spectral resolution better than 5 km s@xmath9 .",
    "narrow lines are therefore more blurred in the gmos data while broad stellar wind features and their p cyg absorption components are well resolved by all three instruments",
    ".    however , forbidden emission lines have an extended component at @xmath11 from the central source @xcite .",
    "the blue emission with velocities of @xmath12200 to @xmath12400 km s@xmath9 is located elongated along the ne - sw axis southwards of the central source @xcite .",
    "the redshifted emission with velocities of @xmath13100 to @xmath13200 km s@xmath9 is more asymmetric and extends towards the north - northwest @xcite .",
    "these components are excluded in narrow extractions of the star in stis observations but not in ground - based data which sample the inner @xmath14 region .",
    "the broad stellar wind features near @xmath104600  , discussed in section [ sec : change ] , normally include several forbidden lines and it is therefore non - trivial to compare _ hst _ with ground - based observations , see section [ sec : long - term ] .    in 2010 june we obtained observations with _ magellan ii _",

    "a 1  slit was used with the 1200/4000 grating centered at @xmath104500   and the 1200/5000 grating centered at @xmath106000  , covering the wavelength range @xmath337006700  .",

    "we also used _",
    "stis / mama observations of the central star with grating e140 m and slit width of 02 , obtained between 2000 march and 2004 march , to investigate @xmath0  car s terminal wind velocity during the 2003.5 event using the @xmath101527 uv resonance line .",
    "the spectral resolution is @xmath16 .",
    "we extracted spectra using a mesa function , corresponding to 013 .    throughout this paper",
    "we quote vacuum wavelengths and heliocentric doppler velocities .",
    "in @xcite we reported dramatic changes in the broad wind - emission features of the central source in @xmath0  car .",
    "we compared spectra at corresponding phases of successive cycles ( phases 0.04 vs. 1.03 , 1.12 vs. 2.10 , and 0.21 vs. 2.20 ) and showed that the broad wind - emission features were considerably weaker in data obtained after the 2009 event , i.e. , after phase 2.00 , and that the absorption had become unusually strong .",
    "observations with _ hst _ stis obtained at phase 2.28 confirm these spectral changes , see figure [ confirm ] .",

    "the binary separation presumably increased by @xmath19 14% while the orbital longitude changed by about @xmath20 .",
    "stis observations in 2010 october ( phase 2.31 ) did not cover h@xmath8 and @xmath106680 but sampled the broad wind features around @xmath104600  .",
    "figure [ confirm]a shows broad , [ ] , , and [ ] emission blends near @xmath104600   which had decreased by a factor of 24 at phase 2.20 compared to phase 0.21 .",
    "the strengths of the broad stellar wind features at phase 2.28 are comparable to the observations at phase 2.20 .",
    "stis observations at phase 2.31 confirm further the secular nature of the weakened emission strengths , see table [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "figure [ confirm]b confirms that the profile of h@xmath8 is altered and weakened in the recent stis data .",
    "the narrow h@xmath8 absorption near @xmath21 km s@xmath9 seen in the tracing at phase 0.21 indicates unusual nebular physics far outside the wind .",
    "this feature had weakened by 2007 , reappeared during the 2009.0 event , but had practically vanished in march 2010 @xcite .",
    "it is still absent in spectra obtained in 2011 december with _ irne du pont _ b&c .",
    "the h@xmath8 profile at phase 2.28 is very similar to the one at phase 2.20 but shows an additional small blue emission feature on top .",
    "this component probably indicates the same or adjoining material as observed in the shifting and emission lines ( @xcite , compare also with figure 1c ) .",
    "note that well after the 2009 event , h@xmath8 showed no signs of resuming what had once been its `` normal '' appearance .",
    "high - excitation emission did not weaken along with the features noted above , but the p cyg absorption greatly strengthened after the 2009 event . in observations at phase 2.28 the absorption is still strong , see figure [ confirm]c .",
    "stis observation of @xmath104714 in 2010 october indicate that the helium absorption strengths may have even increased further compared to the 2010 august observations . emission and absorption lines shift to bluer wavelengths throughout @xmath0  car s spectroscopic cycle , compare tracings at phases 2.20 and 2.28 in the figure ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "overall , we find that observations obtained in 2010 august ( phase 2.28 ) compare well with observations obtained in 2010 march ( phase 2.20 ) ; the wind did not change substantially in - between these observations .",
    "this is further confirmed by the analysis of the few spectral features observed in 2010 october ( phase 2.31 ) . the spectral change since 2004 is thus not simply a peculiarity or aftermath of the 2009 event , but probably represents a significant secular development in @xmath0  car s wind .",
    "we discuss the long - term nature of the spectral changes and their implications in the next sections .",
    "spectral changes such as those found by @xcite were expected in the long - term recovery of @xmath0  car but it was generally assumed that they would occur much more slowly .",
    "the qualitative ground - based record from 1900 to 1990 showed no similar spectral changes in the broad wind - emission lines ( excluding the events ; see many refs .  in @xcite ) . during 19912004 ,",
    "_ hst _ faint object spectrograph ( fos ) and stis spectra showed no obvious secular change in @xmath0 car s stellar wind spectrum .",
    "figure 1a in @xcite , illustrates the similarity of the broad wind features in two successive cycles before 2004 at phases 0.04 and 1.03 .",
    "the 20092010 stis data , however , revealed the weakest broad - line spectrum ever seen in modern observations of @xmath0  car , relative to the underlying continuum .",
    "low - excitation emission from the stellar wind became far less prominent on a time scale of only several years .",
    "we suggest that a decrease of @xmath0  car s mass - loss rate is the most probable explanation @xcite .",
    "a precedent may have been the appearance of the high - excitation lines in the 1940s , probably also due to a change in the wind density @xcite .    to determine whether @xmath0  car s spectrum changed only after  and as a result of  the 2009 event , or if , alternatively , the changes are of a more progressive nature , we investigated spectra obtained since 1998 with several instruments .",
    "the equivalent widths of two / blends near @xmath104600   in data from 19982012 are listed in table [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "ground - based observations , mainly with gmos and uves , fill in valuable data points during the years when stis was unavailable , but they sample a wider region around the star and contain significant contributions from ejecta far outside the stellar wind and from the broad extended emission component of forbidden lines , such as [ ] and [ ] , mentioned in section [ sec : obs ] .",
    "this results in very different equivalent width values for some broad wind features .",
    "fortunately , several gmos and uves observations were obtained close to stis observations , so we can correct for this effect as outlined below .",
    "for example , on 2009 june 30 the equivalent width of the @xmath345704600   feature in stis data was @xmath22(@xmath345704600,stis ) = @xmath23  .",
    "in uves spectra on 2009 june 30 the equivalent width is @xmath22(@xmath345704600,stis ) = @xmath24  , a factor of 1.7 larger .",
    "twenty four days later , on 2009 july 23 , in gmos spectra the equivalent width was @xmath22(@xmath345704600,gmos ) = @xmath25  , a factor of 1.9 larger .",
    "similarly , measurements for the blend at @xmath346144648   are 1.6 times larger in uves and 1.8 times larger in gmos spectra when compared to stis spectra , see table [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "uves and gmos observations overlap during the years 2008 and 2009 and we consistently find somewhat smaller equivalent widths in uves spectra compared to gmos spectra , probably due to their better spatial resolution .",
    "we use the 2009 june stis data set , which mapped the inner 1  region with slit offsets of 01 , to simulate a ground - based spectrum with a spatial sampling of 065 by summing up the flux from the different slits .",
    "the equivalent widths from the simulated ground - based spectrum are ; @xmath22(@xmath345704600,stis,0.65 \" ) @xmath26   and @xmath22(@xmath346144648,stis,0.65 \" ) @xmath27  .",
    "those values agree well with the values obtained with uves on the same day and the ones obtained about one month later with gmos .",
    "the larger values found in ground - based data are therefore due to their larger spatial sampling .    to compare the equivalent widths of the broad stellar wind features from different data sets , we adjust the values from the ground - based data using correction factors so that they are consistent with the values obtained from the stis data in 2009 .",
    "this approach may be questionable because 1 ) the inner and outer regions might not behave similar and 2 ) the 2009 data used to find the correction factors is very close to the 2009 event .",
    "however , our method is justified because following this procedure we find that the uves values in 2002 to 2004 then also overlap with the stis values during those years .",
    "we therefore account for the different spatial sampling of our ground - based data vs.  the _ hst _ data by applying correction factors , see figure [ feii_long - term ] ( applied factors are given in the figure caption ) .",
    "we find that the broad wind - emission features near @xmath104600    decreased gradually by a factor of 23 over the last decade .",
    "additional data sets , in particular the _ 1.5 m ctio _ rc data , agree with this result , see table [ tab : table1 ]",
    ". neglecting observations close to @xmath0  car s spectroscopic events , near phases 1.0 and 2.0 , when other factors dominate , the decline appears to be almost linear .",
    "we also monitored the h@xmath8 and h@xmath28 equivalent widths in observations since 1998 , see table [ tab : table2 ] and figure [ halpha_long - term ] .",
    "_ hst _ stis observations provide coverage over @xmath29 yr .",
    "in addition we analyzed data from the _ vlt _ uves , _ gemini _ gmos , _ magellan ii _",
    "mike , _ irne du pont _ b&c , and _ 1.5 m ctio _ rc spectrographs .",
    "h@xmath8 equivalent width measurements during the 2009 event with the _ 1.5 m ctio _ rc and echelle spectrographs retrieved from @xcite",
    "are also shown in the figure .",
    "unfortunately , h@xmath8 could not be observed in direct view of the star with _",
    "gmos because the line is too bright even for the shortest allowed exposure times .",
    "no `` correction '' for different instruments as described above for the / blends is needed , since the total observed h@xmath8 is dominated by the stellar wind contribution even in ground - based data .",
    "figure [ halpha_long - term ] shows a subtle long - term trend to smaller h@xmath8 and h@xmath28 emission line strengths by a factor of @xmath30 over the last decade , but the decline appears to be more pronounced after the 2009 event . between 1998 and 2003 ( phases 01 ) the strengths of balmer emission remained within @xmath31 of their median value . during the 2003.5 event , h@xmath8 and h@xmath28 declined in @xmath32 days .",
    "h@xmath8 then recovered in @xmath33 days and h@xmath28 faster in @xmath32 days .",
    "the 2009 event appeared , at first , to proceed similar to the previous event ; the line strengths plummeted to a minimum in @xmath32 days .",
    "however , the minimum in 2009 was deeper than during the previous event and the emission did not recover to former strengths afterwards . a related note : photometry at uv to visual wavelengths during the 2009 event also showed deeper minima in the light curves than in previous events @xcite .",
    "@xcite had already reported significant differences in the hydrogen line profiles between the 1998 and 2003.5 events ; each event is distinct . outside the events ,",
    "if we view only the data near phase @xmath34 of each cycle , then figure [ halpha_long - term ] shows a linear trend somewhat like figure [ feii_long - term ] .",
    "the gradual decrease of broad stellar wind - emission such as the / blends and hydrogen emission may represent a drop in @xmath0  car s mass - loss rate .",
    "@xcite found no change in h@xmath28 line strength at phase @xmath35 in four consecutive cycles from 1994 to 2010 .",
    "they argued that h@xmath28 is a better tracer of @xmath0  car s wind than , e.g. , h@xmath8 since it originates deep inside the primary s wind and is therefore less affected by the wind - wind collision region . finding no changes in the h@xmath28 profiles they concluded that no changes occured in @xmath0  car s mass loss rate but that the changes reported by @xcite were likely due to fluctuations in the wind - wind collision zone .",
    "however , teodoro et al .  only compared line profiles at one given phase and from two different data sets with inferior data quality than the data used in our analysis .",
    "figure [ halpha_long - term ] shows that the trend described here is subtle and that individual measurements can fluctuate by up to @xmath36 within days . to investigate the longterm trend a consistent measurement over the last decade as presented here",
    "is needed .",
    "hydrogen p cyg absorption in our direct line of view is basically absent during @xmath0  car s normal state , but strong p cyg absorption develops for several months during the events @xcite , and was observed during the 2009 event @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , we were unable to obtain unsaturated h@xmath8 profiles during the last event , but we did monitor h@xmath28 with gmos . before 2009",
    "january only very weak h@xmath28 p cyg absorption was observed .",
    "strong absorption appeared suddenly between 2009 january 4 and 2009 january 9 . in 2009 august stis data the h@xmath8 p cyg absorption was absent but gmos data still showed weak h@xmath28 p cyg absorption in 2010 january .",
    "basic circumstances hamper the interpretation of @xmath0  car s balmer absorption lines .",
    "presumably they occur in zones where hydrogen is mostly ionized , since the associated emission lines are very strong and excitation to the @xmath37 level is difficult in h@xmath38 regions",
    ". therefore they depend on the ratio @xmath39 , which is small and sensitive to various effects that are hard to quantify for a complex asymmetric wind .",
    "thus we can not safely assume that a balmer absorption strength is well correlated with gas density , for instance .",
    "these difficulties have led to a major interpretational disagreement between , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite , as mentioned below .",
    "the terminal velocity of h@xmath28 p cyg absorption was @xmath40 km s@xmath9 at all stellar latitudes in pre - event 2008 _ gemini _ gmos data ( see section 5 in @xcite ) . during the event , the terminal velocity of hydrogen absorption lines increased in our direct line - of - sight to about @xmath41 km s@xmath9 .",
    "@xcite also found increasing terminal velocities of balmer p cyg absorption lines at moderate latitudes during the 1998 event .",
    "however , this does not necessarily imply that the velocity structure of @xmath0  car s wind changed .",
    "uv resonance lines are better suited to determine wind terminal velocities than balmer lines .",
    "unfortunately , no uv data were obtained during the 2009 event but _ hst _ stis / mama covered @xmath0  car  from 2000 to 2004 .",
    "figure [ uv_si1527 ] compares @xmath101527 in spectra of the star in our direct line - of - sight showing a constant terminal velocity of @xmath0  car s equatorial wind of @xmath42 km s@xmath9.1527 may first be seen as an argument against a decreasing mass loss rate .",
    "however , the available uv data span only about 4 years from 2000 to 2004 ( phases 0.41.1 ) and figures [ feii_long - term ] and [ halpha_long - term ] show no significant changes in the emission strengths of broad stellar wind features during this same time period . ] only at phase 1.033 a higher wind velocity might be possible , but the spectrum shortward of @xmath43 km s@xmath9 can also be explained by the general weakening of emission lines , visible in this same spectral region , during the event .",
    "the terminal velocity found in 1978 iue data was comparable at @xmath43 to @xmath44 km s@xmath9 .",
    "the appearance of hydrogen absorption lines in our line - of - sight to @xmath0  car  and the increase of their terminal velocity may therefore result from changes in the ionization structure of @xmath0  car s wind modulated by the secondary star s uv radiation @xcite or a wind cavity @xcite , and not from a change in the mass - loss structure as proposed by @xcite .",
    "helium emission and absorption processes in @xmath0  car s wind depend on the companion star and have other special characteristics , see section 6 of @xcite .",
    "similar to the case of a photoionized nebula , the amount of emission depends mainly on the hot companion star s helium - ionizing photon output ( @xmath45 ev ) , with only weak dependences on the location of the recombining he@xmath46 , gas density , and other details .",
    "therefore it is not surprising that the helium emission lines behave differently from the lower - excitation features .",
    "the equivalent widths of emission lines remained constant from cycle to cycle .",
    "however , after the 2009 event , the p cyg _ absorption _ strength had greatly increased compared to previous cycles @xcite .",
    "@xcite had already noted increasing @xmath106680 p cyg absorption from 1992 to 2003 .",
    "stis observations since 1998 show that absorption in spectra in direct view of the central source was very weak shortly after the 1998 event , but increased until 2003 . during the 2003.5 event",
    ", the absorption vanished , but reappeared shortly after .",
    "gmos observations , starting in 2007 about 600 days before the 2009 event , show that the absorption increased further .",
    "it then again disappeared during the 2009 event but became very strong by mid-2009 .",
    "overall , the absorption strengths increased since 1998 , only interrupted by episodes close to the events when the absorption disappeared for a few months .",
    "the same behavior is also observed for the @xmath356685712 series , discussed in @xcite .",
    "changes in @xmath0  car s mass - loss rate help to explain these observations , because a lower wind density automatically implies larger photoionized zones . since the observed absorption lines arise from highly excited levels , they are indirect consequences of recombination in he@xmath46 zones , not he@xmath38 @xcite ; and the he@xmath46 gas is probably more extended than it was 10 years ago .",
    "two plausible locations have been suggested , as sketched in figure [ ion_zone ] .    1 .    one is the shocked colliding - wind region , zone 3 in the figure @xcite .",
    "most of the volume there has he@xmath47 at @xmath48 k , but small cooled condensations also exist ( see below ) .",
    "if they intercept most of the secondary star s helium - ionizing photons , then they contain the relevant he@xmath46 gas , and zone 2 in figure [ ion_zone ] shrinks to negligible thickness . in this case a change in the shocked zone , e.g. , an increased opening angle , may explain the increasing p cyg absorption .",
    "in our view , the most likely reason for this to occur is a decrease in the primary wind outflow .",
    "this would move the shocked region closer to the primary star while broadening its opening angle  thus tending to increase the range of directions where a line of sight intersects appreciable he@xmath46 .",
    "on the other hand , as we explain below , the parameters strongly suggest that many of the secondary star s ionizing photons pass between the small shocked - and - cooled condensations , penetrate into the primary wind , and form zone 2 in figure [ ion_zone ] .",
    "as the figure shows , this region becomes dramatically larger if the primary wind density decreases by a factor of three .",
    "is only a sketch and the parameters are poorly known , but it is realistic in an order - of - magnitude sense .",
    "the he@xmath46 ionization fronts were estimated from zanstra calculations for @xmath49 density distributions at @xmath50 k @xcite .",
    "primary mass loss rates of roughly @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xmath53 yr@xmath9 were assumed , with a secondary star having @xmath54 @xmath55 and @xmath56 40,000 k. extra ionization by the primary star was included @xcite , and uv absorption in shocked zone 3 was neglected . in reality",
    "the distinction between zones 2 and 3 is ill - defined on the spatial scale shown here , because the primary shock is very unstable . ]",
    "the upper panel of the figure represents a dense wind , arguably like @xmath0  car s state before 2004 . in that case , most geometric rays from the primary star do not intersect any he@xmath46 gas . with the orbit orientation favored by most authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) , our line of sight to the primary star would pass through the quasi - hyperboloidal he@xmath46 zone only for a limited time near conjunction , 311 months before periastron  depending of course on the orbit orientation and the shock - front opening angle . at other times",
    ", there would be little or no he@xmath46 along the line of sight .",
    "( the same statement applies to the shocked colliding - wind zone . )",
    "the lower panel of figure [ ion_zone ] , by contrast , has a far broader he@xmath46 zone because the wind is less dense by a factor of about 3 .",
    "it notionally represents the situation today . in this case",
    ", our line of sight passes through he@xmath46 during _ most _ of the orbit , except for two or three months before and after periastron .",
    "therefore a decreased wind density improves the observability of absorption , while having little effect on the emission strengths as we noted earlier .    in principle",
    ", zones 2 and 3 in figure [ ion_zone ] may be of comparable importance for the lines . in both cases",
    "a decreased wind density appears to be consistent with the data .    which of the above views is more accurate ?",
    "unfortunately the ionization problem is extremely intricate within the shocked gas .",
    "consider , for example , the primary - wind shock at a time when it is located 15 au from the primary star .",
    "for the sake of discussion , suppose the wind speed is 500 km s@xmath9 , the total mass loss rate is @xmath52 @xmath53 yr@xmath9 , and ignore likely inhomogeneities in the wind .",
    "wind speed is merely conventional .",
    "judging from the bipolar structure of @xmath0 car s ejecta , the outflow may be considerably slower at equatorial latitudes .",
    "] then an idealized adiabatic shock produces post - shock temperature @xmath57 k and electron density @xmath58 @xmath59 . but the cooling time is @xmath60 s ( chapter 34 in @xcite ) , much faster than the outflow escape time @xmath61 s. trapped x - rays may delay the cooling , but not enough to alter the basic situation . therefore a naive one - dimensional shock model has a sheet of cooled gas with @xmath62 20,000 k. this gas is much denser than the pre - shock wind , because pressure equilibrium applies in an approximate sense between the two shock fronts .",
    "consequently it would block practically all incident ionizing photons , so zone 2 in figure [ ion_zone ] would not exist .",
    "this simple view is obviously unrealistic , though , because a number of well - known thermal , fluid , and radiation instabilities disrupt the sheet as rapidly as it forms .",
    "figure 7 in @xcite illustrates this phenomenon in a 2-dimensional model , and the case of @xmath0 car is even more dramatic for two reasons : 3-dimensional geometry allows the development of small condensations , and the radiation pressure of ionizing radiation from the secondary star incites an additional , rayleigh - taylor - like instability .",
    "hence there is little doubt that rapid cooling forms a fine spray of blob - like or filament - like condensations .",
    "figure 7 in stevens et al .",
    "hints that these may form streamers pointed toward the secondary star .",
    "meanwhile , hot shocked gas between the condensations ( @xmath63 k ) contains he@xmath47 and is nearly transparent to ionizing uv radiation .",
    "evidently the question at hand is : _ do the many small condensations intercept most of the uv photons incident on the shock structure ?",
    "_ if they do , then emission and absorption arises mainly within the colliding - wind zone ; but otherwise , zone 2 in our figure [ ion_zone ] is more important .    let us attempt an order - of - magnitude estimate with the same parameters assumed above . for simplicity",
    "we assume that each cooled condensation is a `` blob '' rather than a filament ; if necessary a filament might be represented as a line of blobs .",
    "the characteristic pre - cooling size scale for thermal instability is of the order of @xmath64 au , where @xmath65 km s@xmath9 is the adiabatic - shocked sound speed .",
    "cooling rapidly shrinks this size scale to less than 0.03 au , about 1 percent of the colliding - wind region s overall size scale .",
    "( the shrinkage factor is the cube root of the density - increase factor . )",
    "one expects roughly 300 blobs per au@xmath66 ( i.e. , one per 0.15 au cube ) in the shocked region which is about 3 au thick .",
    "thus we expect a column density @xmath67 blobs per au@xmath68 .",
    "if the geometrical cross - section of each blob is @xmath69 au@xmath68 , then we find an `` equivalent optical depth '' @xmath70 , meaning that comparable numbers of photons either do or do not penetrate through the shocked region .",
    "most of the factors neglected here would tend to decrease @xmath71 .",
    "for instance , radiation pressure tends to either disrupt or ablate a blob on a time scale less than @xmath72 ; and blobs may tend to be aligned with the direction to the secondary star , thereby increasing the transparency of regions between such filaments . in summary ,",
    "the issue is left in doubt , because we can do only an order - of - magnitude assessment .",
    "no computer codes applied to @xmath0 car so far can realistically solve this problem , because a satisfactory model requires ( 1 ) 3-dimensional fluid dynamics with spatial resolution @xmath73 , ( 2 ) realistic thermal and ionization microphysics including possible ablation , ( 3 ) realistic 3-dimensional radiative transfer for the ionizing photons , and ( 4 ) valid input parameters .",
    "none of these can be omitted .",
    "this puzzle is so intricate that tempting approximations may lead to serious errors .",
    "one interesting detail is that each condensation may move semi - ballistically , being too small and dense to follow the general fluid flow ; while the ionizing - radiation pressure is not very much smaller than the thermal gas pressure . a final remark on this sub - topic : in view of the very strong instabilities of the primary - wind shock , exacerbated by inhomogeneities in the primary wind",

    "@xcite reported faster terminal velocities of balmer p cyg absorption lines at the poles than at lower latitudes in 2000 march stis data during @xmath0  car s normal state , which lead them to conclude that @xmath0  car s wind is faster at the poles .",

    "our last observations taken in 2010 january with gmos and in 2011 with _ irne du pont _ b&c indicate that the absorption at the poles had weakened considerably after the 2009 event .",
    "however , since the _ irne du pont _ observations are of lower quality this has to be confirmed in future observations .",
    "the simplest explanation for the weakening of broad stellar wind - emission features is a decrease in @xmath0  car s mass - loss rate @xcite .",
    "the broad stellar wind - emission features appear to be similar from all directions after the 2009 event suggesting that @xmath0  car s asymmetric wind @xcite may have become more spherical over the last 10 years .",
    "if the interpretation of a decrease in mass - loss rate is correct , then the effect is latitude dependent with the mass - loss rate decreasing less or more slowly at the higher stellar latitudes .",
    "however , @xmath0  car s wind is normally assumed to be denser at the poles @xcite and a larger decrease of the mass - loss rate at the equator would not lead to a more symmetric wind .",
    "spectra of the weigelt knots show reflected light from @xmath0  car  and narrow high - excitation emission lines @xcite now attributed to photoionization by a hot companion star . given the rapid spectral changes discussed above , and the accelerated brightening of the central star for the last 15 years @xcite , we expect to observe spectral changes also in the nearby ejecta .",
    "for instance , an early recovery of the high - excitation emission after the 2009 event and a larger continuum flux at the weigelt knots seem reasonable .",
    "unfortunately , the weigelt knots can not be spatially resolved in ground - based observations and their observational coverage with stis is sparse ; in 2003 the pre - event phase was covered , while the recovery phase was observed during the 1998 and 2009 events .",
    "mid - cycle observations are even rarer .",
    "figure [ seachange : fig : fig100 ] shows measurements of the h@xmath8 equivalent width at weigelt knots c and d in stis data for the last two cycles .",
    "further observations are required to confirm the apparent long - term decrease in the emission strength of about 1020% .",
    "factors such as slightly varying slit position angles , pointing , and the fact that the knots are slowly moving outwards ( on the order of 00230044 within 10 years , see @xcite ) might play a role .",
    "we are not concerned here with the line behavior during the events , when the emission strength drops very rapidly for a few months .",
    "figure [ weigeltknots : fig : fig3 ] shows the flux of the narrow [ ] @xmath103870 emission on weigelt knots c and d since 1998 ( compare @xcite ) .",
    "high - excitation emission lines disappear for several months during the events , probably caused by the suppression of uv radiation from the secondary star close to periastron passage .",
    "some authors have suggested that the disappearance of the high - excitation lines are caused by eclipses of a hot secondary star by the primary wind or wind - wind collision shock cone or due to a thermal / rotational recovery cycle .",
    "many authors now agree that a collapse of the wind - wind collision structure @xcite , and/or disturbances in the primary wind @xcite , are primary causes for the observed spectral changes during the events .",
    "these phenomena can be triggered by the periastron passage of a companion star .",
    "the [ ] @xmath103870 emission appears to have recovered faster after the 2009 than after the 1998 event .",
    "if @xmath0  car s wind has been decreasing in recent years , an early reappearance of the high - excitation emission lines would be expected since a lower mass - loss rate of the primary star would result in an earlier recovery of the secondary star s uv radiation output in any proposed model .",
    "however , given the poor temporal coverage of the weigelt knots this result is not conclusive .    surprisingly , the continuum flux at @xmath874000   at weigelt knot d is very constant for the last 10 years , see figure [ weigeltknots : cont ] .",
    "the figure compares the continuum flux at the star and at weigelt knot d. since the stellar continuum is much brighter than the continuum at knot d , we normalized the measurements to unity on 1998 march . in 1998 , the stellar continuum at @xmath874000   was @xmath88 times as bright as on the nearby knot d. the central source then brightened tremendously ( see also figure 1 in @xcite for _ hst _ uv photometry ) .",
    "in 2010 august , the stellar continuum was about 6070 times brighter than the continuum at knot d , which remained practically constant .",
    "this is quite unexpected .",
    "however , the rapid brightening of the central star is largely caused by a decrease in the circumstellar extinction ; the innermost dust is being destroyed or the dust - formation rate has slowed .",
    "our direct view of the star appears to have more circumstellar extinction than the average line - of - sight @xcite and the brightening of the central star may not be equal in all directions .",
    "the spectral changes described in this paper suggest that @xmath0  car s wind density decreased and that the ionization structure of the inner wind changed .",
    "the changes appear to be dependent on the stellar latitude .",
    "eta car s wind may be more spherical now than 10 years ago .",
    "however , the nature of these spectral changes can not be easily explained .    in @xmath0",
    "car s `` normal '' state , balmer p cyg absorption is strong at the poles and weak or absent along our line of sight , near stellar latitude @xmath19 45@xmath7 .",
    "it is therefore thought that @xmath0  car s wind density is higher at the poles @xcite , where it may resemble the spherical model described by @xcite . at lower latitudes , in this view ,",
    "the wind is less dense , which implies stronger ionization and much weaker balmer absorption .",
    "( the column density @xmath89 is small there because @xmath90 and the ratio @xmath91 are both smaller than they are at the poles . )",
    "a complex photoionization structure of the primary wind regulated by the secondary star @xcite or a wind cavity model @xcite may provide additional or alternative explanations .    during the events , balmer p cyg absorption also appears at lower latitudes and the rapidly changing profiles indicate changes in @xmath0  car s wind ionization structure on very short time scales of only days .",
    "@xcite proposed that a minor mass ejection leads to a temporary increase in @xmath0  car s wind density in the equatorial regions resulting in hydrogen recombination .",
    "however , @xmath0  car s wind might be close to a regime where a small change in its wind parameters may lead to transitions between fully ionized and recombined hydrogen in the wind",
    ". this may be the case during the events , when the radiation of the secondary might cause a rapid transition between these two states and the ionization structure of @xmath0  car s wind might temporarily change @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that a wind cavity in the dense primary wind caused by the secondary star may provide an explanation for the deepening of h@xmath8 absorption in our line - of - sight during the events .",
    "observations favoring the latter explanations are the constant terminal wind velocities in uv resonance lines during the 2003.5 event ( see figure [ uv_si1527 ] ) and the appearance of absorption at higher stellar latitudes for a few months before the 2009 event @xcite .",
    "uves spectra before the 2003.5 event , starting at phase 0.9 , show also strong absorption at the pole .",
    "this occurrence is not accounted for by a shell - ejection model .",
    "the long - term weakening of emission in @xmath0  car s wind may be explained with a decrease in mass - loss rate , while the constant emission strength is probably due to competing effects of changes in the helium ionization , which is due mainly to uv from the hot companion star .",
    "long - term changes in the and p cyg absorption lines are related to changes in the ionization structure of @xmath0  car s wind and likely caused by alterations in the mass - loss rate .",
    "for example , demonstrated that the variability of the and line profiles in p cygni resulted from changes in the ionization of its wind .",
    "let us assume that the observed weakening of broad stellar wind features is primarily caused by a decreasing mass - loss rate , which seems natural for @xmath0  car s long - term recovery .",
    "a decrease in mass - loss rate is consistent with the accelerated secular brightening trend in _",

    "instead , we adopted the method by @xcite which relates the h@xmath8 luminosity to stellar mass - loss rate , stellar radius , velocity law , and effective temperature , to roughly estimate the change in mass - loss rate over the last 10 years . assuming that only the mass - loss rate is responsible for the observed changes in h@xmath8 flux",

    "corcoran et al .  also suggested changes in the plasma temperature of the colliding wind shocks , which makes it difficult to assess what physical quantities ",
    "other than mass loss rate of @xmath0  car   may have changed .",
    "a decreasing mass - loss rate could also potentially explain the deepening of and absorption over the last decade .",
    "eta car s wind may be in a stage where even a modest change in mass - loss rate can have a large impact on the wind ionization structure and a decrease in mass - loss rate may cause helium to become ionized in a larger fraction of the wind at low latitudes .",
    "a dramatic drop in @xmath0  car s mass - loss rate mainly at the equatorial regions , however , leads to a significant conflict .",
    "theories of equatorial gravity darkening in massive rotating stars result in asymmetric winds with stellar wind densities and terminal wind velocities being larger at the poles , and the generally accepted hypothesis is that @xmath0  car s mass - loss rate was higher at the poles than at the equator @xcite .",
    "however , recent data imply a more spherical wind ; the terminal velocities of balmer p cyg absorption appear to be fairly constant at all latitudes and emission strengths are equal from all directions .",
    "this can not easily be explained alongside with a rapid decrease in mass - loss rate mainly at the equator .",
    "however , given the observational evidence presented above , the interpretation of a latitude - dependent wind caused by rapid stellar rotation might not be correct .",
    "alternatives to the decreasing - wind interpretation include , e.g. , a change in the latitude - dependence of the wind , changes in the velocity field shape , or the model favored by @xcite , who propose that a small change in wind properties could be amplified by tidal interactions . more detailed analysis and future observations in the next years are necessary .",
    "we can only state here , that @xmath0  car s wind has changed considerably over the last decade but any explanation of the nature of these changes is not straightforward .    as noted in earlier papers , @xmath0  car  may now be returning to a state like that observed three centuries ago , with a nearly transparent wind .",
    "conceivably , however , it may already have reached that state . in 1998",
    "its opaque wind had a pseudo - photospheric temperature of 900014,000 k @xcite .",
    "figure 1 in @xcite indicates that a factor of 2 or 3 decrease in the wind density should probably have raised the apparent temperature to 20,000 k or more .",
    "( modernized opacities do not alter this relative statement . ) according to an argument based on the star s bolometric magnitude compared to the visual magnitude seen by halley in 1677 , the color temperature long before the great eruption was most likely about 20,000 to 25,000 k @xcite",
    ". this value may represent either the star s true effective temperature , or else a marginally opaque wind .",
    "if this reasoning is valid , perhaps the circumstellar extinction is the only remaining difference between the star s appearance today and that seen 150 years before the great eruption .",
    "one implication is that the near - future development can not safely be predicted merely by extrapolating from the past decade .",
    "in this paper we analyzed spectral data obtained with several instruments between 1998 and 2012 .",
    "we confirmed the spectral changes in the wind emission lines first reported by @xcite ; _ hst _ stis spectra obtained in 2010 august , @xmath103 days after the first discovery , are comparable to the observations in 2010 march .",
    "furthermore , we analyzed the long - term development of spectral changes in our direct line - of - sight view of the star , at fos4 , and the weigelt knots .      1 .   broad stellar wind - emission features in our line - of - sight to the star",
    "have decreased by factors of 1.53 relative to the continuum within the last 10 years .",
    "these changes occurred gradually and are dependent on the viewing angle ; spectra at higher stellar latitudes and from the outlying ejecta show smaller changes .",
    "the simplest explanation is a decrease in @xmath0 car s primary wind density .",
    "however , the decrease in wind density appears to be latitude dependent , with emission features showing much less change at higher latitudes . after the 2009 event , emission line strengths are now very similar in our direct line - of - sight view and in the reflected polar - on spectrum at fos4 suggesting a more spherical wind and/or a more uniform distribution of circumstellar extinction .",
    "high - excitation and absorption lines strengthened gradually over the last decade indicating a change in @xmath0  car s wind ionization structure .",
    "hydrogen p cyg absorption at fos4 might have weakened after the 2009 event .",
    "the terminal velocity of hydrogen p cyg lines was found to be similar at all stellar latitudes .",
    "those findings provide additional clues for a more spherical wind .",
    "the observational results presented here are difficult to reconcile with a decrease in mass - loss rate primarily at lower stellar latitudes since it is generally assumed that @xmath0  car s wind had higher densities at the poles @xcite .",
    "our observations may be more readily reconciled with alternative explanations for latitude - dependent spectral features , such as a complex ionization structure of @xmath0  car s wind modulated by the secondary star s uv radiation @xcite or the presence of a wind cavity in the primary wind caused by the secondary star @xcite .",
    "using h@xmath8 emission and the method by @xcite we found that @xmath0  car s mass - loss rate decreased by a factor of 23 between 1999 and 2010 . a decrease in mass - loss rate on",
    "the order of 23 is consistent with changes in the x - ray light curve @xcite . we did not attempt to derive the absolute value with any accuracy because there are too many unknown factors , such as latitudinal dependence and clumping of the wind .",
    "new theoretical models updating @xcite are needed .",
    "observations in 2012 and 2013 will be extremely valuable to further analyze the nature of the spectral changes in @xmath0  car s wind .",
    "it is of great importance to monitor the star consistently since spectral changes may occur on time scales of only weeks to months . for the long - term recovery of @xmath0  car",
    "it is important to investigate if the wind will further decline or if it will stabilize or even recover to its former strength .",
    "but by mid-2013 , the onset of the next event will dominate the spectrum , so observations in 2012 are needed . the last three events all differed from each other and considering the long - term spectral changes described in this paper we can expect many interesting new results from @xmath0  car s 2014.5 event .",
