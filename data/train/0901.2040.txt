    "recent cosmological observations of the cmb show that the main part of the matter in our universe is dark and non baryonic ( hinshaw _ et al . _",
    "if non baryonic dark matter is made of particles , they must be stable , neutral and massive : wimps ( weakly interactive massive particles ) . in the mssm ( minimal supersymmetric standard model )",
    "framework , the wimp could be the lsp ( lightest supersymmetric particle ) called neutralino .",
    "it has a mass between few tens and few hundreds of gev / c@xmath1 , and a scattering cross - section with a nucleon below @xmath2  pb . + the edelweiss ( exprience pour dtecter les wimps en site souterrain ) experiment is dedicated to the direct detection of wimps . the direct detection principle ( used also by other experiments like cdms ( akerib _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , cresst ( angloher _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) and xenon ( angle _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) ) consists in the measurement of the energy released by nuclear recoils produced in an ordinary matter target by the elastic collision of a wimp from the galactic halo .",
    "+ the main challenge is the expected extremely low event rate ( @xmath3 1 evt / kg / year ) due to the very small interaction cross - section of wimp with nucleons .",
    "an other constraint is the relatively small deposited energy ( @xmath3 100 kev ) .",
    "the edelweiss experiment is located under @xmath41700  m of rock ( @xmath44800  mwe ) in the modane underground laboratory ( lsm ) in the highway frjus tunnel connecting france and italy in the laboratory , the muon flux is reduced down to 4  @xmath5/m@xmath1/d , a factor @xmath6 times less than at the surface .",
    "+ the edelweiss - ii experiment installation ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : setup ] ) was completed end of 2005 .",
    "specific improvements have been made in order to reduce the possible background sources that have limited the sensitivity of the previous experiment edelweiss - i ( fiorucci _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite ; sanglard _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) .        to reduce the radioactive background in the cryostat all the materials were tested for radiopurity in a hpge dedicated detector with very low radon level .",
    "the experiment is installed in a class 10 000 clean room and the cryostat environment is submitted to a permanent flow of deradonized air .",
    "the gamma background is screened by a 20 cm thick lead shield .",
    "concerning the low energy neutron background , due to the radioactive surrounding rock , it is attenuated by more than three orders of magnitude thanks to a 50 cm polyethylene shield .",
    "in addition , a muon veto wraps the experiment though muons interacting in the lead shield are tagged .",
    "+ the dilution cryostat is of inverted design , with the experimental detector volume on the top .",
    "the large volume , 50 @xmath7 , allows for the installation up to 120 identical detectors in a compact arrangement , that will improve the possibility of detecting multiple interactions of neutrons and hence reject them .",
    "simulations show a nuclear recoil rate above 10 kev estimated to be less than 10@xmath8 evt / kg / d , corresponding to a wimp - nucleon cross - section sensitivity of @xmath9 pb for a wimp mass of @xmath4 100 gev / c@xmath1 corresponding to an improvement of a factor 100 compared to edelweiss - i .",
    "+ the detectors used in the experiment are high purity germanium crystals with measurement of phonon and ionization signals , cooled at a temperature of @xmath4 20 mk .",
    "the simultaneous measurement of both heat and ionization signals provides an excellent event by event discrimination between nuclear recoils ( induced by wimp or neutron scattering ) and electron recoils ( induced by @xmath10 , @xmath11 or @xmath12-radioactivity ) .",
    "the ratio of the ionization to the heat signals depends on the recoiling particle , since a nucleus produces less ionization than an electron does .",
    "+ one important limitation for the edelweiss - i sensitivity was the presence of surface events , namely interactions occurring near electrodes .",
    "because of diffusion , trapping and recombination , the charge induced by surface events is miscollected and can mimic nuclear recoils . to reach expected wimp - nucleon cross - sections ,",
    "it is necessary to have an active rejection in identifying the surface events . for this purpose ,",
    "the experiment is running with three types of detectors : classic edelweiss - i design 320 g ge / ntd equipped with new teflon holders , 400 g ge / nbsi equipped with two nbsi sensors sensitive to athermal phonons ( juillard _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite ; marnieros _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) and 400 g ge / ntd / id crystal equipped with interdigitized electrode scheme ( broniatowski _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite ; defay _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) ( described in the next section ) .",
    "+ also , an integration test is underway of a scintillation - phonon detector in edelweiss - ii ( di stefano _ et al . _",
    "such detectors could offer additional target materials , and assist understanding of backgrounds and demonstration of a signal .",
    "comparing to edelweiss - i , the edelweiss - ii experiment is completely new with new cryostat , new electronics , new acquisition hardware and software .",
    "consequently the year 2006 has been dedicated to the tuning of electronics , acquisition and cryogenics with 8 detectors . in 2007 , commissioning runs were performed with 25 detectors ( 21 ge / ntd and 4 ge / nbsi ) with gamma and neutron calibrations .",
    "low background runs were also performed in order to study the @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 backgrounds .",

    "[ fig : fondgamma ] shows the electronic recoil background rate in the fiducial volume ( martineau _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) . for energies below 100 kev ,",
    "the rate is approximately 0.6 evt / kev / kg / d which is a factor 2.5 better than edelweiss - i .",
    "the alpha rate background is between 1.6 and 4.4 @xmath10/kg / d , depending on the detector and its near - environment ( for edelweiss - i the mean alpha rate was 4.2 @xmath10/kg / d ) .",

    "no events have been observed in the nuclear recoil band suggesting a possible improvement compared to edelweiss - i .",
    "but more statistics are needed to draw firm conclusions .",
    "a fiducial exposure of @xmath4 100 kg.d obtained in stable conditions is currently being analyzed .",

    "[ fig : lowbckgd ] are shown results for a 200 g ge / nbsi detector corresponding to a fiducial exposure of 1.5 kg.d after cuts removing surface events . on this figure",
    ", the recoil energy is estimated using the fast athermal signal , which gives the best resolution at low energy in this detector , and is also used to detect near - surface events ( marnieros _ et al . _",
    "however the dispersion at high energy is too large and further improvements are needed before using this type of detector for wimp searches .",
    "+        in november 2007 , a new type of detector has been installed in the edelweiss - ii cryostat for which the standard ionization electrodes are replaced by interdigitized ( i d ) electrodes with specific voltage modifying the topology of the electric field near surface ( broniatowski _ et al . _",
    "the signals from the so - called `` field - shaping '' electrodes located on both surfaces of the detector provide an active rejection of surface events .",
    "preliminary test of a 200 g detector at ground level showed a surface event rejection better than 99.5 @xmath13 .",
    "[ fig : id ] shows the data recorded in the edelweiss - ii set - up with a fiducial exposure of 43 days .",
    "resolutions are below 2 kev for both heat and ionization channels .",
    "no events are observed in the nuclear recoil band down to a threshold of @xmath4 15 kev .",
    "the edelweiss - ii set - up has been validated with calibration and low background runs .",
    "energy resolutions and discrimination capabilities close to edelweiss - i results have been measured for ge / ntd detectors .",
    "analysis of @xmath4 100 kg.d of fiducial exposure are underway with the objective of quantifying the improvement of the identification of low energy surface event contamination of the detectors .    in parallel to the operation of classic edelweiss - i type ge / ntd detectors , two types of detectors with active rejection of surface events have been tested .",
    "while progress are still needed for ge / nbsi detectors , considerable advances have been made in the validation of the ge / ntd / id detectors , both in surface laboratory and at lsm . since may 2008 , the 200 g",
    "ge / ntd / id detector has been equipped with a @xmath14pb source to measure the surface event rejection and three other 400 g ge / ntd / id detectors have been installed in the edelweiss - ii cryostat .",
