    "two of the most popular information measures due to shannon @xcite and fisher @xcite respectively , are being increasingly applied in studying the electronic structure and properties of atoms and molecules .",
    "the shannon information entropy @xmath6 of the electron density @xmath7 in coordinate space is defined as @xmath8 and the corresponding momentum space entropy @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the momentum density",
    ". the densities @xmath7 and @xmath11 are respectively normalized to unity and all quantities are given in atomic units .",
    "the shannon entropy sum @xmath12 contains the net information and obeys the well known lower bound by bialynicki - birula and mycielski @xcite who obtained the entropic uncertainty relation ( eur ) which represents a stronger version of the heisenberg uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics .",
    "accordingly , the entropy sum in d - dimensions satisfies the inequality @xcite @xmath13 individual entropies @xmath6 and @xmath9 depend on the units used to measure @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively , but their sum @xmath16 does not i.e. it is invariant to uniform scaling of coordinates .    the shannon information entropies ( uncertainty ) provide a global measure of information about the probability distribution in the respective spaces .",
    "a more localized distribution in position space corresponds to a _",
    "smaller _ value of information entropy . for application of shannon information entropy in chemical physics",
    "we refer the reader to the published literature @xcite .",
    "an example of quantification of order of the chemical bonding employing shannon information is @xcite .",
    "analogous applications for other quantum many - body systems ( nuclei , atomic clusters and correlated atoms in a trap - bosons ) have been reported recently @xcite .",
    "the fisher information measure or intrinsic accuracy in position space is defined as @xmath17 and the corresponding momentum space measure is given by @xmath18    the individual fisher measures are bounded through the cramer - rao inequality @xcite according to @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 s denote the corresponding spatial and momentum variances respectively . in position space ,",
    "the fisher information measures the sharpness of probability density and for a gaussian distribution is exactly equal to the variance@xcite .",
    "a sharp and strongly localized probability density gives rise to a _",
    "larger _ value of fisher information in the position space .",
    "the fisher measure in this sense is complementary to the shannon entropy and their _ reciprocal _ proportionality is , in fact , utilized in this work .",
    "the fisher measure has the desirable properties , i.e. it is always positive and reflects the localization characteristics of the probability distribution more sensitively than the shannon information entropy @xcite .",
    "however , for the electronic density distribution in atoms , the enhanced sensitivity of the fisher measure has not been demonstrated explicitly .",
    "the lower bounds of shannon sum ( @xmath22 ) and fisher product ( @xmath23 ) get saturated for the gaussian distributions . for a variety of applications of the fisher information measure we refer to the recent book @xcite and for applications to the electronic structure of atoms , to the pioneering work of dehesa et al .",
    "@xcite .    in the context of density",
    "functional theory ( dft ) , sears , parr and dinur @xcite were the first to highlight the importance of fisher information , by showing explicitly that the quantum mechanical kinetic energy is a measure of the information content of a distribution .",
    "a link of shannon information entropy with the kinetic energy for atomic clusters and nuclei has also been indicated in @xcite .",
    "the electron localization function @xcite , which has been widely successful in revealing the localization properties of electron density in molecules , has been interpreted in terms of fisher information @xcite .",
    "recently , the euler equation of density functional theory has been derived from the principle of the minimum fisher information within the time dependent versions @xcite .",
    "the shannon information sum @xmath16 has been used in a large majority of applications of information theory in the electronic structure studies involving atoms and molecules . in this work",
    "we define the net information @xmath0 as the product @xmath23 and consider its inverse @xmath24 as representing the net information similar to @xmath16 . in this sense",
    "we propose to employ @xmath0 instead of @xmath16 to assess the utility of the net fisher information vis - a - vis the shannon entropy sum .",
    "this is done in the analysis of experimental properties such as the ionization potential and polarizability , corresponding to the neutral atoms in their ground electronic states .",
    "it is worth noting here that the net uncertainty measures defined in the conjugate spaces are at the foundation of the quantum mechanical probability distribution . as noted above , the quantities @xmath0 and @xmath16 measure the net information content of the probability distribution including its spatial characteristics .",
    "such measures could therefore be tested in their ability to reproduce the trends in atomic sizes , ionization potentials and the polarizabilities , respectively .",
    "very recently the question whether atoms can grow in complexity with the increase in nuclear charge has been addressed @xcite .",
    "in particular the onicescu information measure @xcite in position space @xmath25 and momentum @xmath26 have been defined as the corresponding density expectation values @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the complexity @xmath29 is measured accordingly to the prescription due to lopez - ruiz , manchini and calbet ( lmc ) @xcite as @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath16 denotes the information content stored in the system and @xmath5 corresponds to the disequilibrium of the system , i.e. the distance from its actual state to equilibrium , according to @xcite .",
    "shiner , davison and landsberg ( sdl ) @xcite and lmc measures were criticized in @xcite .",
    "a related discussion can be found in @xcite .    in the light of its sensitivity to describe the localization property",
    "it is useful to consider in the above equation @xmath24 instead of @xmath16 , to define lmc complexity measure based on the net fisher information .",
    "thus a new definition of complexity measure ( lcm - like ) is the following @xmath32    it is generally agreed that the ionization potential ( i.p . ) and static dipole polarizability @xmath33 represent the two key electronic properties of atoms and molecules , which control a host of their other properties including chemical reactivity .",
    "indeed , the dft descriptions of chemical reactivity @xcite such as electronegativity , hardness and fukui functions are intimately related to i.p . and @xmath33 .",
    "due to this reason several interesting studies have been made earlier @xcite to find a correlation between the two experimental properties .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine how well the net fisher information measure correlates with the experimental values of the inverse of the first i.p . and",
    "@xmath33 , of neutral atoms .",
    "in particular , we shall be interested in the relative advantages of using the net fisher information over the shannon information entropy sum . in a similar manner",
    "we also report here the lmc complexity measure based on @xmath24 and point out some of the new features which are not displayed when the @xmath16 is used instead @xcite .",
    "throughout this work we have used the consistent data on the _ spherically _ averaged density @xcite derived from the highly accurate analytic hartree - fock ( hf ) wave functions @xcite .",
    "these results are in quantitative agreement with our results reported earlier , i.e. those derived form the analytic hf wave functions due to bunge et al @xcite . in a large number of cases ,",
    "we have also computed the information measures using numerical hf wave functions and have found similar quantitative agreement .",
    "we note here that the present results do not include any electron correlation and/or relativistic effects .",
    "the experimental ionization potential of neutral atoms has been taken from reference @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we plot @xmath16 and i.p . as functions of @xmath34 .",
    "it is observed that @xmath16 does not perform as a sensitive information measure reproducing the details of the trends in i.p .",
    "it does show the gross atomic periodicity in terms of the shell structure as the humps .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] the values of @xmath0 ( instead of @xmath16 as in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and the _ inverse _ of i.p .",
    "are plotted as functions of @xmath34 .",
    "compared to fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] the two curves in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , resemble each other in far more details .",
    "it has been shown earlier that @xmath2 behaves similarly to i.p . for atoms @xcite .",
    "the net fisher information amplifies the details of correlation by approximately two orders of magnitude .",
    "our aim of plotting @xmath0 versus inverse of i.p .",
    "is to show the similarities in the two curves in the _ upward _ direction and also lay emphasis on the net fisher information , @xmath0 .",
    "we note here that in subsection [ sub : sub3 ] it is @xmath24 that enters the definition of complexity which directly correlates with i.p . very recently",
    ", the idea of taking the relative shannon entropy of an element within a group of the periodic table with respect to the inert gas atom , located at the end of the group has been proposed @xcite in order to get a more sensitive quantum similarity measure of density distributions .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate whether the correlations found in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) can be further improved by using such a similarity measure for each group using the fisher information according to @xmath35,\\ ] ] where @xmath36 measures the distance in compactness of the element @xmath34 from the most compact ideal gas atom in the same group , used as reference .",
    "a larger value of @xmath36 would correspond to smaller i.p .",
    "our use of @xmath36 is inspired by landsberg s definition of order parameter @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a disorder parameter given in terms of the actual entropy @xmath39 and the maximum possible entropy @xmath40 of the system @xcite .",
    "an application of @xmath41 in quantum many - body systems was carried out in @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] we present @xmath41 and [ i.p.]@xmath42 as functions of @xmath34 .",
    "it is found that the correlation is more direct than that obtained in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "this observation suggests that @xmath36 can be used as a measure of quantum similarity of atoms and opens up a new application of the net fisher information measure @xmath0 .",
    "the variation of polarizability @xmath33 of atoms with @xmath16 is found to be essentially similar to that of @xmath16 versus i.p .",
    ", as already given in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . in the background of such insensitivity of @xmath16",
    ", we shall now consider the correlation of @xmath0 with the experimental estimates of polarizability @xmath33 .",
    "the experimental values have been taken from the compilation of miller and bederson @xcite for atoms with @xmath4 .",
    "the variation of @xmath0 and @xmath33 with @xmath34 for atoms with @xmath4 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "the overall correlation is found to be excellent with the maximum polarizability elements of the alkali atoms immediately following the sharply increasing values if @xmath0 just after the inert gas atoms .",
    "the polarizability predicted by @xmath0 for the alkaline atoms present themselves as the only examples which are not sufficiently well discriminated against the neighboring atoms , in this case , the alkali metal atoms .",
    "it appears that the compactness described by @xmath0 in going from the valence electron configuration of @xmath43 to @xmath44 does not increase sharply enough to quantitatively reflect the changes in polarizability from alkali to alkaline earth atoms . for these examples",
    "it is advisable to carry out further computations of the fisher information using wave functions which include electron correlation effects .",
    "finally , we discuss the lmc measure of complexity using eq.([eq : eq6 ] ) in which @xmath16 is substituted with @xmath24 . in an earlier publication @xcite ,",
    "the sdl measure of complexity ( for various indices of disorder and order ) has been plotted as a function of @xmath34 and a series of oscillations around a certain average value , was obtained .",
    "this led to the conclusion that atoms can not grow in complexity as @xmath34 increases .",
    "the latter conclusion was modified in @xcite , where a similarity of sdl ( for magnitude of disorder equal to zero and magnitude of order equal to four ) and lmc measures led to the observation that @xmath29 is an increasing function of @xmath34 . here , in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , we present the measure @xmath45 as a function of @xmath34 .",
    "this curve points to a gradual decrease in complexity with systematic oscillations due to new shells added on as @xmath34 increases .",
    "it is seen that while the fluctuations of complexity following the periodicity of the elements represent a general feature , the issue of the behavior of complexity ( increase or decrease ) with increasing @xmath34 , can not be answered at present with certainty .",
    "such an answer , would be desirable towards the proper description of organization of quantum systems . a separate plot of @xmath5 and @xmath24 in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] suggests that the trend shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] is controlled by @xmath24 .",
    "while the earlier conclusion about the oscillations of complexity in atoms stands vindicated , the use of fisher information measure leads to a more transparent variation of @xmath29 as a function of @xmath34 .",
    "it is also indicated that the decreasing complexity with increasing @xmath34 is bounded by the successive shells as oscillations .",
    "in conclusion , we have found that the _ net _ fisher information denoted by the product of the fisher information in position and momentum spaces ( eq.([eq : eq4])-([eq : eq5 ] ) ) describes the variation of the i.p . and the static dipole polarizability as a function of @xmath34 , more efficiently than the shannon information entropy sum ( eq.([eq : eq1])-([eq : eq2 ] ) ) .",
    "our results also highlight the importance of using the net information in addition to those corresponding to either the position or momentum space separately , in order to analyze and predict the experimental properties .",
    "furthermore , the lmc measure of complexity of atoms as a function of @xmath34 is found that can be transparently expressed employing the net fisher information .",
    "it would be interesting to extend the application of net fisher information entropy to nuclear , molecular and atomic cluster densities .",
