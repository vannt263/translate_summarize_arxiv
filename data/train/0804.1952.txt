    "it is nowadays well established that the calculation of properties of molecules containing heavy atoms requires the inclusion of the kinematic effects of relativity in order to correctly account for their magnitude and , in some cases , even their experimental trends @xcite .",
    "a number of methods and formalisms have been devised for such a purpose @xcite ; among them , _ ab initio _ fully relativistic four - component methods @xcite occupy a privileged position as a reference for benchmark calculations against which more approximated methods are to be compared . in particular , the calculation of the parameters of the nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) spectroscopy are known to be highly sensitive to the relativistic effects @xcite .    from an experimental point of view",
    ", nmr spectroscopy is a powerful tool for the determination of molecular structures , thus enabling its use for a wide range of applications . among the magnetic nuclei , @xmath0pb ,",
    "the heaviest one having spin @xmath1 , is particularly suitable for discriminating among different structures and oxidation states in lead - containing compounds because of its natural abundance ( 22.6% ) and excellent receptivity @xcite .",
    "the high sensitivity of @xmath0pb to its coordination environment gives rise to large changes in its chemical shifts covering a range of about 16000 ppm for the known compounds .",
    "lead can form both inorganic and organolead compounds .",
    "inorganic lead chemistry is dominated by divalent pb(ii ) while organolead chemistry is based on tetravalent pb(iv ) @xcite .",
    "lead dihalides are among the simpler inorganic salts that divalent lead can form .",
    "pbf@xmath2 is probably the most studied lead halide .",
    "solid pbf@xmath2 is a ionic solid presenting a strong superionic conductivity .",
    "it exhibes two phases : an orthorombic @xmath3-pbf@xmath2 phase stable at high pressure and low temperatures , and a cubic @xmath4-pbf@xmath2 phase more stable in ambient conditions .",
    "the absoption spectra of gaseous pbf@xmath2 was first reported in ref .",
    "it was shown that molten pbf@xmath2 vaporizes partly as molecular pbf@xmath2 with a considerable desproportionation @xcite .",
    "measurements of @xmath0pb chemical shifts in lead halide powders have been performed using the magic - angle spinning ( mas ) technique @xcite .",
    "calculations of @xmath5f nmr shielding constants has been reported for a number of metal fluorides , including pbf@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "calculations of molecular structures and vibrational spectroscopic properties for the lead halides , among other group 14 compounds , have been performed by using a correlated complete active space self - consistent field ( casscf ) and multireference singles - doubles configuration interaction ( mrsdci ) wave function , and relativistic effective core potentials ( ecp ) @xcite , the coupled cluster method with singles and doubles excitations and perturbative inclusion of triple excitations , ccsd(t ) , suplemented with ecps @xcite , and density functional theory ( dft ) and ecps @xcite . to the author s knowledge ,",
    "the only theoretical study of the nmr magnetic shieldings of isolated molecules of lead halides is the one presented in ref . @xcite . in that paper",
    "it is also reported calculations in clusters that preserves the orthorombic symmetry of the solid and experimental measurements in solid samples @xcite . however , although an agreement is found with experimental trends , the basis sets used are small and the method of calculation involves too many approximations so that no precise quantitative conclusions can be drawn from the results .    in this paper we shall consider the fully relativistic calculation of the nmr parameters of the lead dihalides with a twofold purpose .",
    "firstly , it is aimed to explain the wide - range variations of the nmr parameters , their large anisotropies , and their experimentally observed regularities as the different halogens are substituted , as well as to identify the underlying mechanisms beneath such a behavior .",
    "secondly , the use of all - electron fully relativistic methods along with large - size basis sets , allows us to test the performance of these reference methods in systems of analogous molecules ranging from pbf@xmath2 , in which the central heavy atom is dominant , to pbi@xmath2 , constituted by three heavy atoms .",
    "fully relativistic , spin - free and nonrelativistic calculations of the electronic structure of the lead dihalides pb@xmath6 ( @xmath7 f , cl , br and i ) were carried out self - consistently with the dirac - coulomb , spin - free @xcite and lvy - leblond hamiltonians @xcite , respectively .",
    "the nuclear magnetic shielding tensor , @xmath8 , and the reduced spin - spin coupling tensor @xmath9 were calculated as four - component linear response functions using the polarization propagator approach within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite .",
    "all calculations were performed with the dirac code @xcite . it should be noted that even the nonrelativistic calculations were done with four - component methods by using the nonrelativistic lvy - leblond hamiltonian .",
    "usually , fully relativistic and nonrelativistic calculations require different basis sets because of the different nature of the relativistic and nonrelativistic operators . all along the calculations reported here ,",
    "the relativistic bases were used and have shown to provide convergence both in the spin - free and lvy - leblond calculations .",
    "the use of a large value of the speed of light in fully relativistic calculations has also been advocated as a procedure to reach the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "the molecular structures were taken from experimental geometries @xcite : @xmath10 , 2.46 , 2.6 and 2.79  , and @xmath11 , 96.0 , 98.8 and 99.7@xmath12 for @xmath7 f , cl , br and i , respectively .",
    "these bond lengths are close to values calculated with the mrsdci method @xcite , but the calculated bond angles are about four degrees larger than the ones used here .",
    "so , there is some uncertainty inherent to our calculations because of their dependence on the molecular geometry . in this work ,",
    "large component uncontracted cartesian gaussian basis set were used in all atoms .",
    "the large component basis sets used in the calculations were obtained from modifying the faegri basis sets ( for pb , br and i ) @xcite and the aug - ccpvtz basis set ( for f and cl ) by suplementing them with large- ( tight functions ) and small - exponent ( diffuse functions ) gaussian basis functions .",
    "these tight ( diffuse ) functions were obtained from multiplying ( dividing ) by a factor of 3 the largest ( smallest ) exponent present in each block of angular momentum . the small component bases sets are generated from the large component bases by invoking the kinetic balance condition .",
    "the final ranges of the exponents in the expanded bases are similar to those used previously in accurate nearly basis set - limit calculations @xcite .      given that the basis set completeness is a critical issue for reliable results , specially in the calculations of the two heaviest halides , the pbbr@xmath2 molecule was taken as a model to test the basis set quality as a function of the functions added to the original basis sets for the large component .",
    "table [ new pbbr2 convergence ] shows the calculated values for the paramagnetic , diamagnetic and total nuclear magnetic shielding in both the lead and bromine nuclei and the one- and two - bonds indirect spin - spin coupling constants @xmath13(@xmath0pb-@xmath14br ) and @xmath15(@xmath14br-@xmath14br ) .",
    "as one goes from basis a ( faegri basis set ) to the large - size basis g , all the quantities converges steadily .",
    "in particular , the shielding diamagnetic terms @xmath16(pb ) and @xmath16(br ) and the two - bonds coupling @xmath15(@xmath14br-@xmath14br ) are reasonably well reproduced with the basis a already .",
    "in contrast , the shielding paramagnetic terms and the one - bond coupling @xmath13(@xmath0pb-@xmath14br ) require of the large bases f or g to achieve convergence within about 10 ppm for @xmath17(pb ) , less than 1 ppm for @xmath17(br ) and _ ca . _ 3 hz for @xmath13(pb - br ) .",
    "since no attempt was done to include electronic correlation effects , the basis f was considered converged enough and it was used for representing pb and br in all the calculations below .",
    "a similar basis scheme was adopted for the other halogens , including functions with exponents of the same order of magnitude as those used in similar atomic calculations @xcite .",
    "the effect of the tight , diffuse and polarization functions added was studied , although not shown here , to ensure that convergence was reached . with such criteria , the pbf@xmath2 , pbcl@xmath2 , pbbr@xmath2 and pbi@xmath2 molecules were described by 2168 , 2288 , 2332 and 2343 gaussian basis functions , respectively .",
    "the large and small component basis sets finally used are listed in table [ basis ] .      following an approximation proposed by visscher @xcite , the contribution from @xmath18-type two - electron integrals , _",
    "i.e. _ those involving small components functions only , were neglected both in the wave function and the response calculations along this paper .",
    "this approximation allows a considerable saving in computational demands , typically decreasing the timings in one order of magnitud .",
    "however , an estimation of their importance was obtained by calculating their contributions in the pbbr@xmath2 molecule with the smallest basis set a. the use of this basis set instead of the larger ones is justified because the small components of the molecular orbitals are densely centered in the atoms and only affect the electronic density in the very proximity of the nuclei , in contrast to the diffuse functions added to basis set a in the bases from b to g. because of that , quite different combination of basis sets @xcite like faegri(pb)/faegri(br ) , faegri(pb)/sadlej(br ) and hirao(pb)/sadlej(br ) yield quite different @xmath19(pb ) and @xmath19(br ) far away from the converged values but , nevertheless , all of them give almost the same contributions from the inclusion of @xmath18-type two - electron integrals , namely , @xmath20 + 50 ppm to @xmath19(pb ) and _ ca . _",
    "+ 1 ppm to @xmath19(br ) .",
    "hence , their contributions to @xmath19(f ) and @xmath19(cl ) are negligible , while they contribute a few ppm to @xmath19(i ) .",
    "all these contributions are below 1% of the total values , thus justifying the exclusion of these integrals .",
    "another approximation consisting in including the @xmath21-type integrals in the wave function calculation although neglecting them in the response calculation of the properties was also tried with similar results .",
    "it turns out that they typically contribute some @xmath22 ppm to @xmath19(pb ) , somewhat less ( @xmath23 ppm ) for @xmath19(i ) and their effect is negligible for the lighter halogens .",
    "this approximation yields an extra saving in computing time and it could be recommendable in order to speed up computations without too much lost of accuracy .",
    "however , for consistency , all the numbers reported in this paper were obtained by fully including @xmath21 two - electron integrals in every step of the calculation .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , < , < , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]",
    "in summary , in this paper we have reported results of calculations of the nmr parameters for the lead halides .",
    "the calculations made use of four - component relativistic dirac - coulomb and nonrelativistic lvy - leblond hamiltonians .",
    "in addition , the use of the spin - free hamiltonian allows to separate the scalar and spin - dependent relativistic contributions .",
    "the results presented in this paper can be rationalized as follows :    _ ( i ) _ the main relativistic correction to the nuclear magnetic constants in lead is the spin - dependent contribution @xmath24(pb ) which can be roughly associated with the spin - orbit interaction , strongly affected by the valence structure .",
    "substitution of increasingly heavy halogens changes dramatically such a structure from pbf@xmath2 dominated by the lead nucleus to pbi@xmath2 , a three heavy atoms molecule .    _",
    "@xmath25(pb ) ranges from 8047 ppm for pbf@xmath2 to 6854 ppm for pbi@xmath2 , what is compatible with a dominant @xmath26 term estimated in 7414 ppm by using an analytical model for the shielding in atoms @xcite .",
    "however , the corresponding estimations for f ( 9 ppm ) and cl ( 64 ppm ) are not good because of the large anisotropies of their @xmath25 tensors ; the model estimates 570 and 1995 ppm for br and i , in moderate agreement with the values of table [ so - scalar ] ( 348 and 1438 ppm ) .",
    "the reason for that is that the spherical symmetry assumed in the model is more approximately realized in the heaviest halogen nuclei .    _",
    "( iii ) _ the @xmath27 term was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it has been shown that , within a perturbative framework , it arises from two linear response contributions ( darwin and mass - velocity ) plus three expectation value terms , with all of them following a @xmath28 power - law scaling with the atomic number ; _ e.g. _ , the perturbative lr - esc method gives @xmath29 ppm @xcite , whose extrapolation to pb would give @xmath30 ppm , in line with the value of about -2300 ppm obtained for all halides .",
    "performing the same extrapolation from the lr - esc value for the nearest rare gas atom ( taken from ref.@xcite ) to each halogen , one has -3.3 , -23.8 , -215.1 and -767.1 ppm , to be compared to -4.8 , -76.3 , -494.6 and -1208.2 ppm of the present work ( table [ so - scalar ] ) .",
    "although the trend is correct , a lack of quantitative agreement still remains .    _",
    "( iv ) _ the @xmath31 term can be disregarded in all cases , what can be attributed to the negligible effect of the spin - orbit interaction upon the inner electronic shells , which are responsible for the diamagnetic shielding .",
    "+ the large spin - dependent effects on the paramagnetic shielding are also responsible for the large observed variations of the lead resonance over a wide range , as well as its large anisotropies , which originates in the different responses of the molecule to the spin - orbit interactions , although every component become proportional to the inverse of the homo - lumo gap .",
    "the same trends are found in the @xmath0pb chemical shifts in the various halides because of the isotropic nature of the relativistic corrections , having a scalar origin , in the reference compound ( plumbane ) . +",
    "both the scalar and the spin - dependent mechanisms are important for the isotropic reduced coupling constants @xmath32 and @xmath33 , although @xmath34 , while @xmath35 . finally , the relativistic one- and two - bonds reduced coupling constants becomes well correlated to the product of the nuclear charges of the coupled nuclei , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "i thank t.  saue ( strasbourg ) for providing a pre - release version of the dirac code during the early stages of this work . +",
