    "measurements of spacecraft motions in the solar system can be used as tests of gravitation and relativity .",
    "recently , anderson et al .",
    "@xcite have presented the discovery of an anomalous effect seen in radio tracking data from the pioneer 10 spacecraft . when interpreted as a doppler shift",
    ", this anomalous effect corresponds to a constant acceleration , directed towards the sun , of approximately @xmath4 cm s@xmath5 .",
    "anderson et al .",
    "( hereafter ) found that the anomalous effect could not be explained by previously known physics or spacecraft properties .",
    "the discovery of the anomaly has stimulated numerous efforts to explain it .",
    "some of the explanations involve `` new physics , '' such as modified gravity or dark matter , while other explanations invoke a change in the physical properties of the pioneer spacecraft , such as a asymmetric radiation profile .",
    "i have considered a third avenue of exploration , which is to test the analysis procedure for flaws . in this paper ,",
    "i present an independent analysis of the pioneer 10 trajectory and search for an anomalous acceleration .",
    "studied radio tracking data from four deep space missions : pioneer 10 , pioneer 11 , ulysses , and galileo .",
    "all four of these missions showed suggestions of an anomalous acceleration of order @xmath6 cm s@xmath1 .",
    "however ,  considered the determination of the anomalous acceleration of the pioneer 10 spacecraft to be the most reliable",
    ". therefore i have focussed exclusively on the pioneer 10 data for my analysis .",
    "once i had verified the presence of an anomalous acceleration , i tested the result for robustness in several different ways .",
    "all of the procedures discussed in this paper were developed by myself @xcite and written in the interactive data language ( idl ) @xcite . during the development i had only minimal contact with the  group authors , and as i detail below , these contacts had a minimal impact .",
    "thus , i consider this work to be an independent test of the analysis by .",
    "i have analyzed a subset of the pioneer 10 tracking data that is available from the public archives , which is , of course , the same data that used in their analysis .",
    "the time coverage of my analysis ( years 19871994 ) is most comparable to that of the original discovery presented in . by necessity",
    ", many of the analysis procedures i developed will be at least similar to those of , but i attempt to extend the analysis by considering additional models , including spacecraft spin , maneuvers , and time - variation of the anomalous acceleration .",
    "the contents of the paper are as follows .",
    "section [ sec : sc - comm ] briefly describes the pioneer 10 spacecraft and the deep space network systems . section [ sec : dataprep ] presents the methods i used to acquire the data and perform initial filtering , while sec .",
    "[ sec : anal ] describes the analysis and modeling techniques that i employed .",
    "the results of the tracking and uncertainty analyses are presented in sections [ sec : results ] and [ sec : uncertain ] .",
    "this is followed by a short discussion and conclusion in sections [ sec : discussion ] and [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "i provide only a cursory description of the pioneer spacecraft , and pioneer and dsn communications systems here .",
    "i refer the reader to , and references therein , for a more complete description .",
    "pioneer 10 was launched on 2 march 1972 and , after an encounter with jupiter , has followed a hyperbolic escape trajectory from the solar system . on 1 january 1987 ,",
    "the spacecraft was approximately 40 a.u .",
    "from the sun , and receding with a nearly constant velocity of 12.8 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the main physical features of the pioneer 10 spacecraft are the parabolic high gain antenna , with a radius of 137 cm ; the instrument compartment , which faces the direction of travel ; and the two radioisotope thermoelectric generators ( rtgs ) , which are attached to the compartment by booms of 300 cm length .",
    "the pioneer 10 spacecraft is spin stabilized , and spins at a rate of @xmath7 rpm .",
    "the spin axis is aligned with the high gain antenna axis , which is designed to point towards the earth , opposite the direction of travel .",
    "the transponder on board pioneer 10 functions in the s - band .",
    "the uplink signal from earth is received by the high gain antenna at 2.11 ghz , while the downlink signal to earth is transmitted at a frequency close to @xmath8 ghz .",
    "i have used only data where the spacecraft communications system was operated in `` coherent '' mode . in this mode ,",
    "the spacecraft retransmits a downlink signal , phase - locked to the uplink , with an exact frequency turnaround ratio of 240/221 .",
    "communications with pioneer 10 are accomplished using the deep space network ( dsn ) .",
    "the dsn maintains antenna complexes at canberra , australia ; goldstone , california ; and madrid , spain .",
    "radio tracking observations are normally obtained in the course of mission operations for the purposes of spacecraft navigation .",
    "the two basic types of tracking are ranging , which directly measures the spacecraft distance via round trip light travel time ; and doppler , which measures indirectly the range rate , or relative velocity along the line of sight .",
    "tracking passes were obtained more or less regularly spaced throughout the time range 19871994 , and within individual years , although there were apparently some campaigns of more intensive tracking coverage .    during uplinks , a digitally controlled oscillator ( dco )",
    "is programmed to a precise frequency , which then drives the exciter assembly , whose signal is sent to the transmitting antenna .",
    "the uplink frequency is typically doppler - compensated so that the frequency received by the spacecraft is near 2.11 ghz @xcite . on the downlink leg , after being received at earth , the pioneer 10 doppler signal is down - converted to a 1 mhz intermediate frequency .",
    "the metric data assembly is used to accumulate a continuous count of doppler cycles at this intermediate frequency , at fixed integration intervals .",
    "the doppler count so computed represents the integrated range rate ( i.e. the line of sight change in distance between the antenna and spacecraft ) .",
    "these quantities are typically differenced and , after further straightforward manipulations , produce the mean doppler frequency over the integration interval @xcite .    since the pioneer spacecraft was 4069 a.u . from the earth for the period of this analysis , the round trip light travel time ranges from 11 to 16 hours .",
    "thus , while it is possible for the same station to be used for both the uplink and downlink legs of the transmission to and from the spacecraft ( known as `` two - way '' doppler ) , it is more common for one station to transmit the uplink leg and a separate station to receive the downlink leg some hours later , which is known as `` three - way '' doppler .",
    "as far as the analysis is concerned , both of these kinds of doppler tracking data are identical and can be handled the same way .    for spacecraft ranging , a unique repeating ranging code is modulated onto the 2 ghz carrier wave . upon return from the spacecraft ,",
    "the received ranging code is correlated with the transmitted one , and a range time delay can be computed , modulo the period of the ranging code pattern .",
    "no reliable range data were available for pioneer 10 , and so i analyzed only the doppler tracking data .",
    "i obtained pioneer 10 doppler tracking data from the publicly accessible nssdc archive .",
    "the jpl radio science group has submitted a substantial portion of the tracking data to the archive in the form of digital tapes which must be staged manually onto a computer disk .",
    "i requested data covering the time period 19871994 .",
    "data from beyond april 1994 is not available from nssdc .",
    "in addition , there are a number of gaps in the data .",
    "the largest gap is due to an unreadable archive tape which covered the interval june 1990 to june 1991 .",
    "the data are stored in a standard archival tracking data file ( atdf ) format @xcite .",
    "an initial level of filtering and processing was applied to the raw atdf records .",
    "a large number of records were in `` one - way '' doppler mode ( i.e. , transmissions originating from the spacecraft ) and were simply discarded .",
    "the integration time of the records was variable , and ranged from 0.1 s ( so - called `` high rate '' doppler ) , to @xmath9 s or more .",
    "the high rate data in particular contained a large number of samples , and to prevent over - weighting of those segments , i chose to accumulate the doppler counts to intervals of at least 60 s in duration .",
    "i also eliminated discontinuous or noisy data , which occur preferentially at the beginnings and ends of tracking passes , or during noisy passes .",
    "a basic sliding 10-sample median filter was applied , and points more than 100 hz from the median were discarded .",
    "the data consist of a time series of observed frequencies at designated dsn antennae .",
    "the dominant variations observed in the data are the annual signature of the earth s motion in the solar system and the diurnal signature of the earth s rotation .",
    "the diurnal term contains both the motions of the receiving and the transmitting antennae involved in the tracking pass .",
    "finally , of course , there is the doppler variation introduced by the pioneer 10 spacecraft itself , which is the sought - after signal .    in this section , i will follow the terminology established by  in identifying epoch of transmission and reception .",
    "the epoch of transmission from the earth is @xmath10 , the epoch of interaction of the signal with the pioneer 10 spacecraft is @xmath11 , and the epoch of reception back at the earth is @xmath12 .",
    "all of these times are referred to the barycentric dynamical timescale ( tdb ) , which is a coordinate time at the solar system barycenter .",
    "tdb is also the effective argument of the jpl planetary ephemerides .",
    "the 3-vectors @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 represent the positions of the corresponding antenna at the corresponding epoch , and @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 represent the velocities . the vector difference , @xmath19 ,",
    "is defined as @xmath20 .",
    "these vector quantities are measured in the solar system barycenter frame .",
    "the original station times in the atdf records are referred to coordinated universal time ( utc ) . when computing earth rotation and orientation quantities , the terrestrial dynamical time ( tdt ) timescale is used .",
    "conversion between the utc , tdt and tdb timescales is straightforward using standard practices @xcite .",
    "the expected frequency at the receiver at time @xmath12 can be expressed as @xmath21 d_{23 } +      \\delta\\nu_{\\rm path } , \\label{eqn : doppler}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the uplink frequency at time @xmath10 as measured at the transmitter , @xmath23 is the spacecraft spin frequency at time @xmath11 , and the ratio @xmath24 is the spacecraft transponder turnaround ratio ( note that @xmath25 ) .",
    "the factors @xmath26 and @xmath27 embody the doppler shifts of the moving spacecraft and earthbound antennae .",
    "the frequency multiplier on the uplink leg is @xmath28 where the first fraction represents the relativistic doppler shift due to the earth motion , and the second due to the spacecraft motion .",
    "the unit vector @xmath29 points from the transmitting station to the spacecraft , i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "the downlink factor , @xmath27 , is constructed in the same fashion , by substituting @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the final term in equation [ eqn : doppler ] , @xmath33 , represents additional doppler effects caused by small effective path length changes , aside from those due to geometric antenna motions . generally speaking",
    ", this term can be written as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the time rate of change of effective photon trajectory path length along the line of sight .",
    "the factor of 2 comes from the two legs of the round trip path .    in this paper",
    "i consider the effective path length due to the `` shapiro '' delay @xcite .",
    "the shapiro delay reflects the extra proper distance traveled by a photon , beyond the classical geometric distance , in the sun s gravitational potential , as predicted by general relativity , @xmath36 , \\label{eqn : shapiro}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is a parameter of the parameterized post - newtonian formulation of gravity @xcite . for general relativity , @xmath38 .",
    "on an annual timescale , the impact parameter of the photon trajectory increases and decreases , with a minimum distance of about @xmath39 km .",
    "conversion to a doppler shift is achieved by numerically differentiating equation ( [ eqn : shapiro ] ) , which yields an annual signal with amplitude @xmath40 mhz .",
    "as discussed further below , i do not model the effects of the solar corona .",
    "the known quantities are the receiver quantities @xmath12 , @xmath41 , and the station identification for each doppler sample . in order to compute the expected frequency at the same epoch ,",
    "all of @xmath42 and @xmath43 must be determined .",
    "this is especially important because even the time of transmission , @xmath10 , and hence the transmission frequency , @xmath22 , are not known _",
    "a priori_. starting from the reception epoch , the spacecraft epoch @xmath11 is determined by solving the light travel time equation @xcite , @xmath44 via an iterative process , using the known trajectory and rotation properties of the earth , and a trial trajectory of the spacecraft . in the same way",
    ", the transmission epoch @xmath10 can be determined .",
    "the atdf data contains a special record of the transmitter configurations , including the frequency of the antenna s dco , from which the transmitted frequency @xmath22 can be determined .",
    "the motions of the earth center are interpolated from the jpl de405 planetary ephemeris @xcite , which is referred to the axes of the international celestial reference frame ( icrf ) .",
    "the position and velocity of earth stations with respect to the geocenter , referred to an inertial coordinate system such as the icrf , must take into account earth rotation and the changes in earth orientation parameters .",
    "the apparent sidereal time , which is the hour angle of the earth referred to an inertial system , is taken from aoki et al .",
    "earth precession and nutation describe the motion of the earth rotation axis with respect to the celestial sphere .",
    "these parameters are determined based on the standard iau 1976 ( precession ) and iau 1980 ( nutation ) theories , and are expressed as a function of tdt .",
    "the nutation in obliquity and longitude are corrected using series provided by the international earth rotation service ( iers @xcite ) , which determines these angles to high precision via regular very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations of distant quasars . the polar motion with respect to the international terrestrial reference frame ( itrf ) , and small variations in the length of day ( i.e. , ut1@xmath45utc )",
    "are also taken into account .",
    "coordinates of earthbound dsn antennae , referred to the itrf , are also known to centimeter precision or better based on vlbi , are taken from an existing dsn publication @xcite ( but see sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] ) .",
    "the trajectory of the pioneer 10 spacecraft must be determined by integrating the equations of motion over the time interval of interest , given a trial set of initial conditions .",
    "the equations of motion i used were @xmath46 where @xmath47 is due to newtonian gravity , @xmath48 is the acceleration due to solar radiation pressure ; and @xmath49 is an anomalous acceleration term ( i.e. , that which is not accounted for by known physics )",
    ".    considers additional terms for the acceleration which allow for alternate theories of gravity ( their equation 3 ) .",
    "i find that over the span of the data , these terms are always smaller than @xmath50 cm s@xmath5 , and thus i neglect them for the purposes of doppler tracking analysis .",
    "other accelerations which i disregard : solar wind pressure ( @xmath51 cm s@xmath1 ) ; collisions with interplanetary dust ( @xmath52 cm s@xmath1 , to heliocentric radii of 60 a.u .",
    "@xcite ) ; and the gravitational attraction of the kuiper belt ( @xmath53 cm s@xmath1 @xcite ) .",
    "the newtonian gravitational acceleration was computed as @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the mass and position of solar system body @xmath57 , referred to the j2000 coordinate frame .",
    "the bodies included in the sum were the sun , moon , and planets , the positions of which were interpolated from the jpl de405 planetary ephemeris @xcite .    in a manner similar to",
    ", i model the acceleration due to solar radiation pressure as radially directed outward from the sun with a magnitude @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the barycentric position of the sun , and the other constants in the equation are defined in table [ tab : quant ] . for the pioneer 10 geometric area",
    "i have used the area of the high gain antenna , which has a radius of 137 cm .",
    "the angle of the antenna to the sun , @xmath60 , is always less than @xmath61 for pioneer 10 after 1987 , and here",
    "i have approximated it as @xmath62 with a loss in precision in acceleration of @xmath63 cm s@xmath5 .",
    "the pioneer 10 anomalous acceleration , @xmath49 , is modeled primarily as a constant acceleration , @xmath64 , where here @xmath65 is a unit vector pointing from the sun to the spacecraft . as noted by  ( and below ) , the doppler tracking data for pioneer 10 do not permit one to distinguish between a geocentric or heliocentric acceleration , so this representation is also equivalent to an acceleration directed along the earth - spacecraft line . as i am using the `` usual '' sign convention for frequencies and velocities @xcite , a negative value for @xmath66 will represent an apparent acceleration towards the sun .",
    "i also test the constancy of the acceleration by adding a _ jerk _ term , @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the anomalous jerk , which measures the deviation of the acceleration from a constant .",
    "this expression can be rewritten as @xmath69 where @xmath70 represents the timescale over which the anomalous acceleration changes . however , since the heliocentric spacecraft velocity is nearly constant with time ( heliocentric radial velocity range of 13.112.6 km , with a mean of 12.8 km s@xmath5 ) , the jerk term is also equivalent to a spatial gradient of the anomalous force , and equation [ eqn : reljerk ] can also be rewritten as @xmath71 where r is the heliocentric distance and @xmath72 is the physical distance scale for variations in the acceleration .      the pioneer 10 antenna is designed to point towards the earth .",
    "as the spacecraft moves outward through the solar system , regular maneuvers must be made to adjust the spacecraft attitude to maintain an earth - pointing direction .",
    "the spacecraft has two thruster assemblies mounted on the rim of the high gain antenna , which are aligned with the antenna and spin axes . during the maneuvers ,",
    "the thrusters execute several small pulses , with each thruster assembly firing in opposite directions . the spin axis is gradually precessed until a spacecraft feedback loop determines that the antenna axis is again pointed towards the earth . according to",
    ", the maneuver duration is about 15 minutes .    in principle , the impulses from the thrusters are in opposite directions , and thus should impart no net change in velocity to the spacecraft . in practice ,",
    "the control of the thruster nozzles is imperfect , and it is possible that a small velocity change will be imparted during the maneuver . in most cases , these velocity increments or decrements are directly visible in the doppler tracking data ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] ) .",
    "i treated these velocity changes as adjustable parameters . for the @xmath57th maneuver , i modeled the velocity change as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a free parameter and @xmath75 is a unit vector which points from the earth to the spacecraft at the time of the maneuver .",
    "the precise epochs of the maneuvers are not easily determined from the atdf data available from the nssdc archive . in principle",
    "these data should always be available , in a `` high doppler rate '' mode , since maneuvers can only be performed during tracking passes .",
    "unfortunately very little of the high rate data is present in the archive .",
    "rather than guess at the maneuver epochs , i requested and obtained from the anderson group a file which contained the epochs of the maneuvers as used in the chasmp program @xcite . however",
    ", the velocity increments and directions were determined by my own independent analysis .",
    "since the maneuvers are modeled with a single quantity , they determine the _ mean _ velocity shift per maneuver .",
    "shorter time scale effects , like transient leakage from the thruster nozzles , will not be modeled .",
    "however ,  found that transient effects were small , and i will not model them further .  provides a sample case of a maneuver from december 23 , 1993 .",
    "this data was also present in the nssdc archive files , and i was able to verify that the behavior was very close to that described by",
    ".      the downlinked tracking signal is affected by the spacecraft spin ( equation [ eqn : doppler ] ) .",
    "the nominal spin period is approximately 4.4 rotations per minute ( rpm ) , however the actual spin period has varied between between 4.25 and 4.55 rpm over the time span of the data considered in this paper .",
    "like the maneuver data , it could be possible to determine the spacecraft spin from high rate doppler data taken during precession maneuvers .",
    "because this data was largely unavailable from the nssdc archive , i also obtained a file from the anderson group which contained a detailed pioneer 10 spin period history @xcite .",
    "these spin rate measurements come from a variety of sources @xcite , including the star sensor , the imaging photo polarimeter , and the doppler signal from precession maneuvers . during the analysis",
    ", i performed linear interpolation between tabulated points in the file .",
    "while i did not determine the spin history independently , there are several mitigating factors .",
    "first of all , a spin rate of 4.55 rpm corresponds to an effective frequency shift of @xmath7675 mhz .",
    "as i will show , a signal of this magnitude could in principle be detectable against the doppler noise , but it is much smaller by a factor of @xmath77 than the signal due to the anomalous acceleration by 1994 .",
    "second , the more relevant quantity is how the spin rate _ change _ affects the doppler frequency . for my data , the frequency shift due to the spin rate change is only @xmath78 3 mhz , which is essentially undetectable .",
    "i checked these results by performing an analysis run where the spin rate was held fixed at its mean value , and also at zero , and the changes were negligible .",
    "the equations of motion were integrated using an adams - bashford - moulton predictor corrector algorithm , based on the ddeabm @xcite routine of the slatec library @xcite ( translated to idl @xcite ) .",
    "this integrator is of variable order ( up to order 13 ) and adaptive step size .",
    "i adjusted the error control parameters so that frequency residuals were less than 0.1 mhz .",
    "the initial conditions were the initial spacecraft position and velocity referred to the solar system barycenter .",
    "several additional data filtering criteria were applied , which relate to the effects of the earth s troposphere and the sun s corona on the doppler signal . the earth s troposphere is known to introduce an additional signal propagation delay on the order of tens to hundreds of nanoseconds .",
    "this effect is strongly dependent on the elevation angle of the spacecraft to the horizon . at low elevation angles , the secant effect multiplies the tropospheric delay by several times .",
    "in addition , there are terms in the tropospheric delay which depend both on the season , and atmospheric conditions at the time of the observation .",
    "these effects are most readily seen in ranging experiments were signal delay directly corresponds to range error . for doppler tracking data ,",
    "the tropospheric effect enters more subtly , as the time derivative of the delay , since during a single tracking pass the spacecraft s apparent position will generally increase or decrease in elevation .",
    "using my best - fit model ( see below ) , i divided the residuals into intervals based on their elevation angle at time of reception .",
    "figure [ fig : rhel - elv ] shows the root mean squared ( rms ) residuals in each interval , and demonstrates that below @xmath79 elevation there is a strong increase . while  chose to apply an elevation - dependent weighting function which included data at low inclinations , but at a reduced weight , i simply excluded points for which either the received or the transmitted elevation angle was smaller than @xmath79 .",
    "the solar corona also affects the quality of the data . during solar conjunctions",
    ", the trajectory of photons passes within ten solar radii of the center of the sun .",
    "similar to the troposphere , the bulk solar corona introduces a variable delay of 01.7 @xmath80s .",
    "the derivative of this variation may be imprinted on the doppler signal .",
    "however  found that the net effects of the solar corona were small , and ultimately ignored them .",
    "i constructed a similar coronal model to that of  and also found that the the net effects of the solar corona on the doppler signal were small .",
    "however the solar corona is not a uniform medium .",
    "in addition to the net propagation delays due to the coronal plasma , there is a general increase in the doppler noise .",
    "figure [ fig : rhel - elv ] also shows a plot of the rms residuals as a function of the photon trajectory impact parameter . clearly the noise is enhanced for impact parameters within @xmath81 cm ( @xmath82 0.5 a.u . ) , and so i also elected to exclude any trajectories which passed within that region .",
    "the excluded segments are shown in figure [ fig : bestfit ] , labeled as `` c. ''    finally , i found that there were several segments of data that were particularly noisy , and also elected to exclude those from further analysis .",
    "these segments were from 14 to 29 september 1987 , 18 january to 23 february 1992 , and 13 march to 29 april 1992 , and are shown in figure [ fig : bestfit ] , labeled as `` n. '' i could not find a direct explanation for why these particular segments were of a lower quality than the others .",
    "i should note that the exclusion of the segments mentioned above had a small effect on the result .",
    "when , in a separate analysis , i included all of the data , the same value for the anomalous acceleration was reproduced to within 6% .",
    "however , because of the sensitivity of the least squares optimization technique to outliers , it is prudent to exclude highly noisy data which can significantly bias the result .",
    "the doppler data were fitted to the model iteratively using a least squares technique .",
    "the fitting code is based upon minpack-1 @xcite , but translated to idl @xcite .",
    "the free parameters are : ( 1 ) the position and velocity of the spacecraft at the initial epoch ; ( 2 ) an anomalous acceleration ; ( 3 ) velocity increments @xmath74 due to maneuvers ( a total of 18 increments ) ; and ( 4 ) in some cases a jerk term .",
    "the earth station coordinates and velocities were also preliminarily considered to be free parameters . upon completion of the fit , parameter uncertainties were estimated by adjusting the doppler frequency uncertainties so that the @xmath83 value was equal to unity , and appropriately rescaling the parameter uncertainties derived from the covariance matrix of the fit .",
    "in addition to providing the parameter uncertainties , this method also provides an estimate of the variance of the doppler residuals for a given model .    since outliers can still be a problem , i gradually removed the outliers by applying a threshold filter .",
    "initially the acceptance region for residuals was @xmath7810 hz around zero . as the fit steadily improved , i narrowed the acceptance region until i reached a minimum of @xmath7860 mhz .",
    "the distribution of residuals for the best fit is shown in figure [ fig : resid ] .",
    "the distribution has a clear sharp peak ( @xmath84 width of 4.2 mhz ) , with broad wings that extend at least to 30 mhz and beyond .",
    "thus , the measured variance in the residuals will always be larger than 4.2 mhz , and depend largely on the size of the acceptance window .",
    "i decided that a @xmath7860 mhz window was a reasonable compromise between too lax and too aggressive outlier removal .",
    "a total of 312,116 doppler records passed the preliminary filtering process described in sec .",
    "[ sec : dataprep ] .",
    "i found this number of data points to be unwieldy to process simultaneously in core memory of a typical workstation computer , both in terms of memory consumption and processing time .",
    "i elected to literally decimate the data , taking only every tenth sample .",
    "this resulted in 31,211 raw records for the main processing runs .",
    "after application of the corona , tropospheric and low - noise selection criteria , a total of 23,852 or 76% of the records remained .",
    "as a consistency check , i applied the same analysis to successive independent batches of 31,211 records drawn from the full pool of doppler records .",
    "i found that each batch produced comparable results to the main batch .",
    "the distributions of parameter values from all ten batches were well matched by the error estimates taken from the rescaled covariance matrix , and therefore i have reasonable confidence that the covariance matrix produces appropriate statistical parameter uncertainties , even in the environment of outlier points .",
    "in my best fit model i can confirm the signature of a constant acceleration acting on the pioneer 10 spacecraft .",
    "figure [ fig : bestfit ] shows the best fit model with and without the anomalous term @xcite . table [ tab : anom ] shows the best fitting anomalous acceleration value , @xmath66 , for various cases , as well as the inferred variance in the doppler residuals .",
    "the best fitting value of @xmath66 for 19871994 is @xmath85 cm s@xmath1 , where the uncertainty is statistical only .",
    "it is clear that the doppler residuals show an increasing trend . by the end of the data span in 1994 ,",
    "the frequency of the received doppler signal is higher than expected by approximately + 2.7 hz in a single round trip .",
    "the entry labeled ``  interval i '' refers to the specific time intervals defined by .",
    "interval i spans 3 january 1987 to 17 july 1990 and interval ii spans 17 july 1990 to 12 july 1992 .  also considers a third interval which continues up to july 1998 .",
    "because my data set contains a large gap from 1990.51991.5 , and no data beyond 1994.3 , i consider it inappropriate to quote a value of @xmath66 in intervals ii and iii for direct comparison to",
    ".  finds anomalous accelerations in interval i of @xmath86 and @xmath87 for the sigma and chasmp techniques , respectively ( @xmath88 cm s@xmath1 ) . here",
    "i have used the weighted least squares values with no corona model , as these are the most comparable to my own .",
    "generally , there is good agreement between the work of  and myself .",
    "the best fit case was performed without a jerk term . when a jerk is included",
    ", the fit improves slightly ( as judged by the reduction in the rms residuals ) , and the anomalous acceleration value increases by about 5% .",
    "the small fitted jerk value demonstrates that the anomalous acceleration is reasonably constant over time , even when allowing the maneuver parameters to vary .",
    "i have included two fits with simplified spacecraft spin models .",
    "the first model , `` mean spin , '' assumes that the spacecraft spin remains constant at its mean value of 4.40 rpm .",
    "the second model , `` no spin , '' assumes that the spacecraft has no spin at all .",
    "both cases produce results that are essentially indistinguishable from the best fit case , with similar values of @xmath66 and similar qualities of residuals . thus , while the spin data was not independently determined by myself , it has little impact on the final result .",
    "the reason that the zero spin solution does not contain @xmath89 mhz residuals is that these residuals are essentially constant , and can easily be absorbed into the other free parameters , such as the initial velocity vector and the maneuver velocity increments .    taking this possibility to its logical extreme",
    ", one might surmise that the entire anomaly could be absorbed into the other free parameters .",
    "the next entry in table [ tab : anom ] , `` only maneuvers , '' fixes @xmath90 while allowing the other parameters to vary .",
    "i found that the anomaly is indeed absorbed into the maneuver velocity increments , as might be expected .",
    "however this possibility is not likely for several reasons .",
    "first , the rms residuals are considerably worse . if one were to take the `` best fit '' case as a good fit , i.e. a reduced @xmath83 value of unity , then the `` only maneuvers '' case would have a reduced @xmath83 value of 7.2 , which is very unlikely statistically .",
    "the residuals also show systematic trends which actually _ magnify _ the doppler discontinuities across maneuver epochs ( figure [ fig : onlymanu ] ) .",
    "also , one would have to explain how a set of maneuvers , whose times are irregularly spaced , could produce a steady increase in the velocity of the craft over 7.5 years to within one percent .",
    "finally , the maneuver velocity impulses must be significantly larger in magnitude than the `` best fit '' case by a factor of @xmath91 .",
    "for these reasons i believe that the `` only maneuvers '' case to be extremely unlikely .",
    "the final entry in table [ tab : anom ] is the case where no maneuvers are modeled , i.e. all of the @xmath74 are set to zero .",
    "of course , doppler discontinuities are clearly visible in this case ( figure [ fig : nomanu ] ) , but they are ( a ) small compared to the anomaly , and ( b ) both positive and negative sign , compared to the anomaly which is unidirectional .",
    "this result shows that even without any modeling of spacecraft maneuvers , the anomaly is significantly detected , and although considerable effort was put into accurate maneuver modeling , even a crude model would have sufficed .    in all of the values cited in table [ tab : anom ]",
    ", the positions and motions of the earth stations were fixed to the values determined from vlbi @xcite .",
    "[ the station motions are due primarily to tectonic drift . ] in another fit ( not shown ) , i allowed the station coordinates to be free parameters .",
    "i found that the fitted station coordinates converged to the quoted positions to within a few meters .",
    "therefore , i left the stations fixed to their fiducial positions .",
    "while  divided their data set into three separate intervals , i do not believe this approach to be appropriate for the abbreviated data set that i have access to .",
    "therefore , in my discussion i quote the `` best fit '' value , which covers the entire 19871994 range .",
    "discovered annual and diurnal signatures in their residuals , which had amplitudes of approximately 10 mhz each .",
    "while the source was ultimately undetermined ,  believed the periodic residuals to be due to previously unrealized errors in the tabulated solar system ephemerides , and therefore considered it to be a systematic uncertainty in the analysis .",
    "as can be seen in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : bestfit ] , i also detect modulations of the @xmath76annual residuals at a similar amplitude .",
    "i also consider this effect to be a systematic uncertainty .",
    "finally , i considered the geometric origin of the anomalous acceleration .",
    "as i have already mentioned , i assumed that the anomalous acceleration was directed toward the sun . in a separate fit",
    ", i adjusted the equations of motion so that the acceleration was directed toward the instantaneous position of the earth instead of the sun .",
    "this change altered the doppler residuals systematically by less than 0.5 mhz , and altered the best fit anomalous acceleration value by less than 2% .",
    "thus , the center of acceleration could be either the sun or the earth and still be consistent with the data .",
    "presented a comprehensive discussion of the systematic uncertainties associated with the determination of the anomalous pioneer acceleration .",
    "i do not intend to repeat such a discussion , but instead will summarize and adjust it .",
    "divided the uncertainties into three main categories : those generated external to the spacecraft , those generated on board the spacecraft , and computational uncertainties .",
    "estimated that the uncertainties associated with effects external to the spacecraft were essentially negligible , with an rms contribution of @xmath92 cm s@xmath1 .",
    "the largest estimated systematic uncertainties were associated with effects generated on board the pioneer 10 spacecraft .  estimated the rms contribution of these effects to be @xmath93 cm s@xmath1 , which included terms for the reflected heat from the rtgs ;",
    "differential emissivity of the rtgs ; non - isotropic radiative cooling of the spacecraft ; gas leakage ; and other smaller effects .",
    "i adopt those values here .",
    "the third category , computational uncertainties , were estimated to be @xmath94 cm s@xmath1 , and included terms for consistency of modeling ( @xmath95 ) and the unmodeled annual and diurnal residuals .  was able to rely on their interval iii ( july 1992july 1998 ) for the most consistent determination of anomalous acceleration , but most of that data was not available to me .",
    "thus the consistency between different models in my analysis will by necessity be less .",
    "for the purposes of this work , i will take @xmath95 to be one half of the range of anomalous acceleration determinations , or @xmath96 where , to be conservative , i have included the `` extreme '' cases in table [ tab : anom ] ( compare to a value of @xmath97 cm s@xmath1 determined by ) .",
    "thus , the total estimated computational uncertainty is @xmath98 cm s@xmath1 .",
    "the combination of the uncertainties from all three categories , assuming they are are uncorrelated , is @xmath99 cm s@xmath1 .",
    "also identified experimental `` biases , '' which were other effects that would tend to systematically increase or decrease the anomalous acceleration from its experimentally determined value .",
    "for example , they estimated that the radio transmitter exerts a radiation force which accelerates the spacecraft at @xmath100 cm s@xmath1 , directed away from the sun .",
    "this acceleration would tend to _ increase _ the anomalous acceleration .",
    "their final bias value , using the sign convention of this paper @xcite , is @xmath101 cm s@xmath1 , which i also adopt .    clearly , the uncertainty in the determination of the anomalous pioneer 10 acceleration is systematics - dominated and not statistics - dominated .",
    "determination of the absolute jerk is therefore similarly dominated by systematic uncertainties .",
    "formally , i take the upper limit to the absolute jerk to be @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the data time span of 7.5 years .",
    "this upper limit is a factor of @xmath761.5 larger than the value determined in table [ tab : anom ] .",
    "a more interesting quantity is the _ relative jerk _ ( e.g. , equation [ eqn : reljerk ] ) .",
    "the doppler tracking data alone show a reasonably linear correlation with time , and hence require a small relative jerk .",
    "the effects of a jerk term would be strongest in the 19941998 time range of the  data set , but  did not see the effect .",
    "i will therefore still consider the jerk term shown in table [ tab : anom ] , expressed relative to @xmath66 , to be an upper limit .",
    "this leads to @xmath104 and @xmath105 which implies that the anomalous acceleration , if it varies , must do so on broad spatial or temporal scales .    for my determination of the anomalous acceleration i will assume that the jerk is zero , and hence use the `` best fit '' case of table [ tab : anom ] . following the terminology of",
    ", i label that experimentally determined quantity to be @xmath106 cm s@xmath1 . after adding the bias value and assigning the systematic uncertainty , i arrive at @xmath107",
    "my best value of the anomalous acceleration agrees quite closely with the value determined by  ( @xmath108 cm s@xmath1 ) , although it should be pointed out that i have essentially adopted their error analysis estimates directly .",
    "the rms residuals of all of the `` non - extreme '' cases in table [ tab : anom ] are of order 8 mhz .",
    "this variance level is half of the standard error of 15 mhz that  assigned to their doppler data processing , and thus compares quite favorably with their result ( despite the outliers ) .",
    "the scope of this paper is to verify the pioneer 10 anomalous acceleration by performing an independent analysis .",
    "i will however discuss briefly some implications for alternate explanations of the effect .",
    "mentions the yukawa potential @xcite as a candidate form of modified gravity , @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are adjustable parameters . upon computing the gradient of this potential and expanding in a power series of heliocentric radius @xmath112 , one finds @xmath113\\ ] ] where the first term is the newtonian acceleration .",
    "the second term has a clear analogy to equation [ eqn : radjerk ] , where @xmath114 is the term in parentheses , and the length scale @xmath115 a.u .",
    "thus , if the yukawa acceleration  or any other modified - gravity acceleration  were to deviate from newtonian plus a constant , this deviation would occur over spatial scales larger than the planetary solar system .",
    "the anomalous acceleration has been proposed to be caused by radiation from the rtgs or electronics in the instrument compartment @xcite .",
    "all electric power on - board is derived from the rtgs , which in turn derive their power from radioactive decay of @xmath116pu , with a half - life of @xmath117 yr .",
    "this radioactivity also produces considerable waste heat of approximately 2000 w. as little as 63 w of electromagnetic radiation , if radiated directionally away from the sun , could explain the anomalous effect",
    ".  has advanced several arguments against these classes of explanations for the anomaly .",
    "one argument is that the anomaly is well enough determined over time that the radioactive decay of @xmath116pu should be detectable , but is not .",
    "if the acceleration were related to heat dissipation , then its functional form would be @xmath118 this equation is again a direct analog of equation [ eqn : reljerk ] , however with the constraint that @xmath119 yr .",
    "this limit still accommodates the half - life of @xmath116pu , so an explanation based on radiation from the rtgs can not necessarily be excluded by my analysis of the 19871994 pioneer 10 data @xcite .",
    "if the doppler errors are considered to be approximately constant over time , then the error in the jerk should scale as @xmath120 , so additional data over a longer baseline could and should be much more constraining .  considered the constancy of the anomalous acceleration by dividing the data into three separate intervals , and attempting to analyze the intervals independently of one another .",
    "they found a variation of 2.05.1% between their intervals i and iii .",
    "the `` jerk '' solution i present here would produce a variation in the acceleration between the midpoints of the two intervals of about 8% , a value which is not unreasonably inconsistent with the results of .    in order to test the sensitivity to a jerk term",
    ", i performed a test using simulated data .",
    "i used the best fit trajectory _ with jerk _ to construct a synthetic doppler series , without noise , over an 11.5 year baseline on a regularly sampled time grid .",
    "i then fitted that series to a model with _ no jerk _ , but including maneuvers .",
    "i found that a reasonably good fit could be found .",
    "the rms residuals were @xmath121 mhz , which is much smaller than the typical rms residuals of the actual best fit models .",
    "the signature of the jerk was a small parabolic curve in the residuals in each segment between maneuvers .",
    "thus , i consider it possible that a jerk term could be present in the residuals without being readily apparent .",
    "an analysis of the full doppler data set would be desirable .",
    "i have confirmed by independent analysis that the pioneer 10 anomalous acceleration exists in the doppler tracking data , and is likely not to be an artifact of the software processing by",
    ". direct comparison to s sigma acceleration value in their interval i yields agreement at better than the 1% level .",
    "the anomaly is robust to different choices of spacecraft spin model , and also produces a consistent value even when all maneuvers are removed .",
    "this data does not constrain whether anomalous acceleration is geocentric or heliocentric . by including a jerk term ,",
    "i have showed that the acceleration is reasonably constant as a function of time over a 7.5 year time baseline , but not constant enough to rule out thermal radiation effects due to radioactive decay of plutonium on board the spacecraft .",
    "this work uses data provided by the national space science data center ( nssdc ) .",
    "i would in particular like to thank ralph post for his efforts in staging the pioneer 10 data tapes , and also john cooper and sharlene rhodes at the nssdc for their general assistance .",
    "i appreciate useful conversations with george dishman .",
    "i thank slava turyshev for providing several data files , and consultation of a general nature .",
    "i thank tod strohmayer and jean swank for providing useful comments on the manuscript .",
    "i acknowledge aladar stolmar , who spurred my initial interest in this subject .",
    "the doppler compensation of the uplink signal largely accounts for the annual motion of the earth , for which only a crude orbit prediction is required .",
    "this compensation does not disrupt the determination of the anomalous acceleration , since the relevant quantity is always the _ difference _ between the received and transmitted frequency .",
    "the iers data file was found at ftp://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/finals.all , which contains series for earth polar motion coordinates , nutation corrections , and the ut1-utc deviation for may , 1976 , to the present .",
    "distinguishes between the `` usual '' and `` jpl '' sign conventions for presenting frequencies and velocities . in this paper ,",
    "all quantities are presented using the `` usual '' convention .",
    "higher frequencies are more positive ; lower frequencies are more negative .",
    "a receding spacecraft has a positive velocity ; an approaching one has a negative velocity .                      for completeness",
    "i also tested whether the center of acceleration could be any other planet .",
    "i found that any of the inner planets ( mecury through mars ) could be the center without producing significantly different doppler residuals .",
    "i believe this is because the inner planets orbit quickly enough that any component of the acceleration directed away from the sun is averaged to zero over the doppler timespan .",
    "if , on the other hand , the center of acceleration were a fixed point in the solar system , then such averaging does nt occur , and the fixed point would therefore need to be within @xmath122 a.u .",
    "of the sun to be consistent with the doppler data .",
    "i thank slava turyshev for suggesting this analysis .",
    "similar reasoning can be made regarding explanations which invoke thermal radiation from the electronic components , since the electric power output of the rtgs has also been decreasing on a @xmath76decade timescale ( see figure 16 of ) ."
