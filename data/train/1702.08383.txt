    "the narrow - line seyfert  1 ( nls1 ) galaxies , a subclass of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have been the centre of interest because of their extreme variability in the x - ray band @xcite .",
    "the defining properties of this class of agn are : balmer lines with full width at half - maximum fwhm(h@xmath11 ) @xmath12  km  s@xmath13 @xcite , strong permitted optical / uv fe ii emission lines @xcite and weaker [ oiii ] emission @xmath14\\lambda5007}{h_{\\beta}}\\leq3 $ ] @xcite .",
    "the x - ray spectra of seyfert galaxies show a power - law like primary continuum which is thought to arise due to thermal comptonization of the optical / uv seed photons in a corona of hot electrons surrounding the central supermassive black hole ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "the optical / uv photons are thought to arise from an accretion disk but direct observational evidence is lacking .",
    "similarly , the interplay between the accretion disk and the hot corona is not well understood .",
    "many type  1 agn also show strong ` soft x - ray excess ' emission over the power - law continuum below @xmath15  kev in their x - ray spectra .",
    "the existence of this component ( @xmath16  kev ) was discovered around 30  years ago ( e.g. @xcite ) and its origin is still controversial .",
    "initially , it was considered to be the high energy tail of the accretion disk emission ( @xcite ) , but the temperature of the soft excess is in the range @xmath17  kev which is much higher than the maximum disk temperature expected in agn .",
    "it was then speculated that the soft excess may result from the compton up - scattering of the disk photons in an optically thick , warm plasma ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "currently , there are two competing models for the soft x - ray excess emission in terms of optically thick thermal comptonization @xcite and blurred reflection from partially ionized accretion disk @xcite .",
    "however , these models sometimes lead to spectral degeneracy because of the presence of multiple spectral components in the energy spectra of nls1 galaxies @xcite .",
    "one efficient approach to overcome the spectral model degeneracy is to study the root mean square ( rms ) spectrum which links the energy spectrum with variability and has been successfully applied in a number of agn ( mcg6 - 30 - 15 : @xcite , 1h  0707495 : @xcite , rx  j1633.3 + 4719 : @xcite ) .",
    "observational evidence for the emission in different bands such as uv , soft and hard x - rays during large variability events may help us to probe the connection between the disk , hot corona and the soft excess emitting regions .    in this manuscript , we investigate the origin of the soft x - ray excess emission , rapid x - ray variability and uv / x - ray connection in pg  1404 + 226 with the use of both model dependent and model independent techniques .",

    "@xmath157 measures the correlation or coupling between @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",

    "the fractional rms variability spectrum , the best - fitting ` two - component phenomenological ' model and residuals are shown in figure  [ fig7a ] .    in pg  1404 + 226",
    ", the soft excess was modelled by two different physical models : intrinsic disk comptonization and blurred reflection from the ionized accretion disk . in order to break the degeneracy between these two possible physical scenarios , we made fractional rms spectral model considering our best - fitting disk comptonization and blurred reflection models to the time - averaged spectrum .    in the disk comptonization scenario , the observed variability in pg  1404",
    "+ 226 was driven by variation in the accretion rate as inferred from the joint fitting of 5 epic - pn spectra .",

    "the rapid x - ray variability had been observed in a few nls1 galaxies ( e.g. ngc  4051 : @xcite , 1h  0707495 : @xcite , mrk  335 : @xcite ) .",
    "the uv emission form pg  1404 + 226 is much less variable ( @xmath2=3.9@xmath3 ) compared to the x - ray variability and is observed to lead the x - ray emission by @xmath6  ks .",
    "the source exhibited a strong soft excess below @xmath23  kev , which was modelled by intrinsic disk comptonization as well as blurred reflection component .",
    "the x - ray ( 0.3@xmath338  kev ) spectra revealed the presence of a highly ionized ( @xmath170  erg  cm  s@xmath13 ) absorbing cloud along the line - of - sight with column density of @xmath171  @xmath22 .",
    "3 .   the time - resolved spectroscopy shows significant variability in the soft excess and primary power - law flux , although there was no noticeable variations in the soft excess temperature ( @xmath172  kev ) and photon index ( @xmath173 ) of the primary continuum .",
    "4 .   in the disk comptonization scenario",
    ", the rapid x - ray variability can be attributed to a change in the mass accretion rate as indicated by time - resolved spectroscopy .",
    "however , the modelling of the x - ray fractional rms spectrum using ` one - component disk comptonization ' model can not reproduce the observed x - ray variability pattern and indicates reflection origin for the soft excess emission ( see fig .  [ fig7b ] ) .",
    "5 .   in the reflection scenario",
    ", we found that the observed large - amplitude x - ray variability was predominantly due to two components : illuminating continuum and reflected emission which are variable in normalization only ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7b ] ) . 6 .   the inner disk radius estimated from the blurred reflection model is @xmath174 which implies a rapidly rotating black hole at the center of pg  1404 + 226 and is consistent with the measurement performed by @xcite .",
    "the non - detection of the 6.4  kev iron emission line is perhaps due to its smearing into the broad shape in the spectrum .",
    "we found that the soft ( 0.3@xmath331  kev ) and hard ( 1@xmath3310  kev ) band count rates are correlated with each other and vary in a non - linear manner as suggested by the steepening of the flux - flux plot .",
    "the fitting of the hard - vs - soft counts plot with a power - law plus constant ( plc ) model reveals a significant positive offset at high energies which can be interpreted as corroboration for the presence of a less variable reflection component ( probably smeared iron emission line ) in the hard band .",
    "the observed uv variability in pg  1404 + 226 is weak with @xmath2=3.9@xmath3 only , whereas the x - ray variability is much stronger ( @xmath4=89.0@xmath5 ) .",
    "we found that the uv variations lead the x - ray variations by @xmath175 in pg  1404 + 226 .",
    "similar behaviour had also been observed in another seyfert  1 galaxy mcg-6 - 30 - 15 @xcite .",
    "the time - lag between the uv and x - ray variations in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 was found to be @xmath176  ks and interpreted as a signature of the accretion flow propagation .",
    "the uv lead observed in pg  1404 + 226 is much shorter than that seen in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , although pg  1404 + 226 is hosting more massive ( a factor of 10 ) black hole than mcg-6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "the observed lead of @xmath175 for variations in the uv emission compared to the variations in the x - ray emission is likely to be the result of the thermal comptonization of the uv seed photons in a compact hot corona . in this process",
    ", the uv lead can occur due to",
    "( i ) the light - crossing time between the uv emitting region of the disk and the compact hot corona , and ( ii ) the time required for the multiple inverse compton scattering of uv photons into x - ray photons . the light - crossing time required by the uv photons to reach the compact hot corona",
    "can be written as @xcite @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the scaled mass accretion rate , @xmath98 is the central black hole mass in units of @xmath179 and @xmath180 is the effective wavelength where the disk emission peaks . in the case of pg  1404 + 226 , @xmath181 , @xmath182 ( calculated from the unabsorbed flux in the energy band @xmath183  kev using the convolution model cflux in xspec ) and @xmath184 for uvw1 filter .",
    "therefore the light crossing time between the x - ray source and the disk is @xmath185  ks , which corresponds to the peak disk emission radius of @xmath186 .",
    "recent results on x - ray reprocessing lags @xcite have shown that the agn disks are larger than that predicted for the standard disks .",
    "however , we did not observe the reprocessing lag .",
    "the uv emission from pg  1404 + 226 is most likely to be dominated by the intrinsic emission from the disk . in the framework of compton up - scattering , a uv photon with energy @xmath187 after @xmath188 scatterings produces an x - ray photon of energy @xcite @xmath189 where @xmath190 , @xmath191 and @xmath192 and @xmath193 are the electron temperature and rest mass , respectively . if @xmath194 is the time delay between successive scattering and the x - ray photons are produced within the optically thin , hot corona after n scatterings , then the comptonization timescale is @xmath195 for an optically thin ( @xmath196 ) , hot ( @xmath197  kev ) corona of size @xmath198 , the estimated comptonization timescale is @xmath199  ks .",
    "thus the observed uv lead of @xmath175 can indeed correspond to the sum of the light - crossing time ( @xmath185  ks ) between the disk and power - law emitting region and the comptonization timescale ( @xmath200  ks ) of the uv seed photons within the hot corona .    in the intrinsic disk comptonization ( optxagnf )",
    "model , the soft excess emission results from the compton up - scattering of the uv seed photons by optically thick , warm ( @xmath201  kev ) electron plasma in the inner disk ( below @xmath95 ) itself .",
    "however , if the optically - thick corona is the inner disk , it is unlikely that it will intercept significant amount of seed photons from intermediate or outer disk .",
    "thus , the seed photons for the optically - thick thermal comptonization must arise from the inner regions of the standard cold disk . hence , the soft excess emission from the comptonized inner disk and the intrinsic uv emission from the intermediate regions of standard cold disk are likely to be connected only via the propagation of accretion rate fluctuations , and the intrinsic uv emission from the standard disk should lead the soft excess by the propagation fluctuation timescale . assuming that the fluctuations in the accretion rate propagate with the speed of sound waves in the radial direction , the timescale of propagation fluctuation @xmath202 can be written as @xcite @xmath203 where the dynamical time scale @xmath204 , @xmath205 is the disk height at the radius @xmath206 for the observed uv emission . if we consider a thin disk for which height - to - radius ratio , @xmath207 @xcite , the propagation fluctuation timescale at this emission radius ( @xmath208 ) is of the order of @xmath209  s which is much longer than the observed uv lead",
    "hence , the observed uv lead is unlikely to be due to the propagation of accretion rate fluctuations .",
    "unlike the comptonized inner disk in the optxagnf model , the hot corona is likely spherical and can intercept significant fraction of uv seed photons .",
    "thus , in the framework of optxagnf model , the uv lead is entirely due to the comptonization of seed photons in the hot corona . in this case",
    ", it is difficult to explain the correlation between the soft excess and the power - law components unless the variability is intrinsic resulting from simultaneous gravitational energy release both to the inner , comptonized disk and the hot corona .",
    "however , it is difficult to explain the uv  x - ray connection as the propagation fluctuation timescale is longer compared to the observed uv lead .",
    "therefore the only possible explanation for the observed uv lead is that the uv seed photons from the disk travel all the way up to the hot electron plasma , get compton up - scattered within the compact hot corona and produces the x - ray power - law component .",
    "pg  1404 + 226 shows strong x - ray variability with increase in overall fractional rms with energy .",
    "we attempted to explain the observed rapid variability of pg  1404 + 226 in the framework of two possible physical scenarios : intrinsic disk comptonization and blurred reflection from the ionized accretion disk . in the disk comptonization scenario ,",
    "if the rapid x - ray variability is due to the mass accretion rate changes which is favoured by the time - resolved spectroscopy , then it can not explain the rms variability pattern below 0.4  kev and in the hard band ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7b ] , left ) .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that the rapid x - ray variability is caused by variations in the mass accretion rate alone . on the other hand ,",
    "the soft excess and primary continuum vary non - linearly ( as @xmath10 ) which indicates that the soft excess is coupled and reciprocating with the primary continuum variations .",
    "this is in agreement with the smeared reflection scenario which is further supported by the high emissivity index ( @xmath210 ) .",
    "moreover , the fractional variability spectrum of pg  1404 + 226 is best described by two components illuminating continuum and reflected emission which vary in normalization only and perfectly coupled with each other .",
    "the variations in the reflected component and primary continuum are @xmath211 and @xmath212 , respectively . in the blurred reflection model ,",
    "the soft excess is a consequence of the disc irradiation by a hot , compact corona close to the black hole .",
    "the correlated , non - linear variability between the illuminating continuum and soft excess emission is consistent with the light bending model @xcite .",
    "our results indicate that the thermal comptonization of the uv seed photons from the accretion disk produces the x - ray power - law component which in turn illuminates the innermost accretion disk giving rise to the soft x - ray excess emission in pg  1404 + 226 .",
