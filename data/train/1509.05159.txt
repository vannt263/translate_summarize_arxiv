    "x - ray absorption near - edge structure ( xanes)@xcite and solid - state nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr)@xcite spectroscopies are powerful probes of the electronic and local structure of inorganic materials .",
    "the combination of these two techniques provides a deep understanding of the electronic and structural properties of materials .",
    "for instance , a recent study coupling x - ray absorption spectroscopy and nmr successfully resolved the local structure of al sites in zeolites.@xcite the noticeable improvements in methodology and instrumentation resulted in a spectacular enhancement of the quality and resolution of spectra for both techniques.@xcite nonetheless , the huge amount of information contained in experimental spectra makes their accurate assignment difficult . to address",
    "this difficulty theoretical tools are used beforehand or in conjunction with experimental data.@xcite    most first - principle calculations in the solid - state consider the nuclei fixed at their equilibrium positions , as obtained by x - ray or neutron diffraction .",
    "however , atoms are subjected to quantum thermal fluctuations , which reduce to the zero - point motion at the absolute zero ( 0  k ) .",
    "temperature - dependent experiments exhibit significant variations of spectroscopic properties , such as chemical shifts,@xcite relaxation times,@xcite and electric field gradient values @xcite ( efg ) measured by nmr or the pre - edge structures observed in xanes spectra of oxide materials.@xcite in the case of nmr , it has been observed that the chemical shifts vary of several ppm when temperature increases over thousands of degrees.@xcite the efg tensor is also very sensitive to temperature and nuclear quadrupole resonance experiments have shown a variation of the resonances frequencies @xmath0 up to @xmath1  khz.k@xmath2.@xcite in the case of xanes spectroscopy , it has been recently shown that the intensity and position of the pre - edge peak highly depend on temperature.@xcite it has been demonstrated that the pre - edge structure is due to a violation of symmetry induced by the quantum thermal fluctuations .",
    "for instance , at the al @xmath3-edge of various oxides , the nuclear motion is responsible for the appearance of a pre - edge peak corresponding to the @xmath4 forbidden electronic transitions.@xcite    multiple attempts to theoretically reproduce the lattice dynamical effects in solid - state spectroscopies have emerged in the literature .",
    "pioneering approaches based on averaging the chemical shielding tensors over different orientations of mobile species were proposed to include nuclear motion in nmr calculations.@xcite in parallel , it was shown that small displacements of either the absorbing atom@xcite or the @xmath5 initial wave function in the crude born - oppenheimer approximation@xcite could reveal forbidden transitions in @xmath3-edge xanes spectra .",
    "although quite promising , these methods do not account for the collective lattice dynamics .",
    "a substantial theoretical work proved that vibrations could be represented as the convolution of the x - ray absorption cross section , calculated for the equilibrium configuration , with the phonon spectral function.@xcite this theory has been applied to reproduce room - temperature experimental xanes spectra in ref .  .",
    "in the case of non - quantum nuclear motion , the method of choice would be molecular dynamics ( md ) at finite temperature , either classical or _",
    "ab initio_. in nmr , _ ab initio _",
    "md was used to study the dependence on temperature of the chemical shift @xcite and quadrupolar relaxation rates@xcite but mostly in organic compounds .",

    "seeking for computationally less expensive methods , monte carlo sampling has been used to account for the vibrational effects on the chemical shifts in mgo@xcite and recently a more computationally efficient method arose by assuming a quadratic coupling between vibrations and the shielding tensor.@xcite the monte carlo sampling method was also used to simulate xanes spectra of molecules in solutions,@xcite but , to our knowledge , it has not been applied to inorganic solids yet .",
    "the purpose of this work is to describe quantum thermal fluctuations , using methods based on density - functional theory ( dft).@xcite in the born - oppenheimer ( bo)@xcite and quasi - harmonic approximation ( qha),@xcite the thermal effects are modeled by generating atomic position configurations obeying quantum statistics at finite temperatures .",
    "the theoretical work is confronted to nmr and recently acquired xanes temperature - dependent experiments for our proof - of - principle compound mgo .",
    "this ionic oxide has been chosen for three main reasons : ( i ) its rock salt structure is ideal to observe thermal effects as its lattice constant is the only free parameter , ( ii ) it shows no phase transition up to its melting point around 3250  k,@xcite allowing a wide temperature range for experimental measurements , ( iii ) multiple theoretical studies demonstrated that the harmonic behavior of mgo remains at temperature as high as 1500  k and its debye temperature has been found , theoretically , to be about 941  k.@xcite    the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
