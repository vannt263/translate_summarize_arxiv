    "quiver algebras and their quotients arise in many contexts and have been extensively studied .",
    "a result of gabriel @xcite establishes that for every finite dimensional @xmath1-algebra @xmath6 such that @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the jacobson radical of @xmath6 , there exists a finite quiver @xmath0 , the gabriel quiver of @xmath6 , and an epimorphism @xmath9 such that @xmath10 for some @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 is the two - sided ideal generated by @xmath5 .",
    "_ monomial algebras _ are those for which @xmath13 is generated by monomials . in the particular case",
    "when @xmath14 , the algebra @xmath6 is a _ truncated quiver algebra _ , denoted tqa from now on .",
    "this property of @xmath6 turns out to be intrinsic @xcite which makes tqa s a distinguished class .    for these classes of algebras",
    "bardzell @xcite introduced a minimal resolution that plays a key role in the treatment of homological questions and problems .",
    "a main contribution of this paper is the explicit construction of comparison morphisms between the standard bar resolution and bardzell s minimal resolution for tqa s .",
    "we believe that such morphisms , sought for a long time , should have many applications",
    ". our construction in this case could inspire others to find comparison morphisms for wider classes of algebras , hopefully for all monomial algebras .    as a direct application",
    "we describe explicitely the yoneda product and derive several results on the structure of the cohomology ring of tqa s . in the near future",
    "we will complete a full description of this ring .      since the early nineties several authors have investigated different homological questions for a number of classes of monomial algebras , including tqa s .    in the context of truncated quiver algebras , cibils @xcite proved that @xmath15 for all @xmath16 if the quiver has no oriented cycles . a shorter proof of this fact was later given in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , liu and zhang @xcite showed that @xmath15 for all @xmath16 if and only if the quiver has no oriented cycles of some specific lengths .",
    "more recently , skldberg @xcite gave a complete description of the homology of tqa s .",
    "his computations are based on the use of bardzell s minimal resolution . in the same paper",
    "he treats also the case of quadratic monomial algebras with an analogous approach .",
    "the resolution used in @xcite was introduced by bardzell @xcite for monomial algebras , and has shown to be an efficient tool for computations in contrast to the usual bar resolution .",
    "recently , n.  marconnet in @xcite constructed a comparison morphism between the two for the first non trivial degree , in the context of cubic artin - schelter regular algebras .    the first cohomology computations for tqa s appeared in @xcite where the second cohomology group is described to study formal deformations and to characterize rigidity .",
    "in the subsequent paper @xcite these results were extended to the class of monomial algebras .    a description of the whole cohomology of tqa s , over fields of characteristic zero ,",
    "was given by locateli in @xcite .",
    "her computations also rely on the use of bardzell s minimal resolution , and cohomology classes are represented by pairs of parallel paths .",
    "the particular case of truncated cycle algebras is treated separately . recently in @xcite the case of arbitrary characteristic was solved .",
    "the determination of the structure of the full cohomology ring is still a difficult problem that has been addressed in a number of cases .",
    "for instance , for a radical square zero algebra , a description of the yoneda product on hochschild cohomology is given in @xcite and it is shown that this algebra is finitely generated only for the case when the underlying quiver is a cycle or it has no oriented cycles .    for truncated cycle algebras , the complete structure of the cohomology ring was determined in @xcite and independently in @xcite , showing in particular that the yoneda product is non trivial and the cohomology ring is finitely generated .",
    "cycle algebras are examples of self - injective nakayama algebras . in @xcite",
    "the authors present in contrast some examples of non injective nakayama algebras for which the product is trivial ( in non zero degree ) and in particular the cohomology ring , which is infinite , is not finitely generated .",
    "being @xmath17 a graded commutative @xmath1-algebra every homogeneous element of odd degree squares to zero ( @xmath18 ) and if @xmath19 is the ideal generated by the homogeneous nilpotent elements , then @xmath20 is a commutative @xmath1-algebra .",
    "one expects to gain information for the full cohomology ring from this simpler one .",
    "in @xcite it was conjectured that @xmath20 is finitely generated as @xmath1-algebra for any finite dimensional algebra @xmath6 .",
    "this was recently proved in @xcite for monomial algebras and was already known for other classes ( see @xcite ) . in @xcite the quotient @xmath20 was determined for the subclass of stacked monomial algebras , class that contains tqa s .",
    "these results applied to tqa s yield @xmath21 .",
    "however , since @xmath17 is , in general , infinite dimensional over @xmath1 , the structure of the full ring @xmath17 remains open .",

    "they are subtle and give an insight on the non trivial combinatorics underlying this problem .    with the comparison morphisms at hand",
    "we describe first the yoneda product at the level of the minimal resolution and then determine the product in cohomology .",
    "the minimal resolution is naturally bigraded , but the product in this resolution is not compatible with this bigrading .",
