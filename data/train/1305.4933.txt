    "high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) provide one of the best probes of the endpoint of massive stars evolution .",
    "these binaries consist of a compact object accreting material from a massive companion , allowing stringent lower limits to be placed on the mass of the compact object progenitor .",
    "furthermore , the high luminosity of the companion allows the potential for radial velocity measurements to determine the binary mass ratio . in cases where the hmxb is x - ray bright , the x - ray variability and spectral properties yield information about the nature of the accretion flow onto the compact object .",
    "because hmxbs are such powerful laboratories for understanding both high - mass and binary stellar evolution , the known x - ray bright systems in the galaxy have been studied in great detail ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "determining the ages of hmxb systems in the milky way is difficult due to distance uncertainties and high extinction , as most hmxbs are in the galactic plane .",
    "the most fruitful studies to date have focused the smc , which find a typical formation timescale of 2560 myr @xcite .",
    "this timescale would explain the smc s richness in hmxb , since it experienced a strong episode of star formation @xmath150  myr ago @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to determine conclusively why hmxbs would preferably form on a @xmath150  myr timescale .",
    "one possible explanation is that this is the time when b stars ",
    "the most common type of secondary in hmxbs  shed mass at the highest rate . in the galaxy , b star activity reaches a maximum between 25 and 80  myr @xcite , in broad agreement with the hmxb age distribution in the smc .    herein , we turn our attention to two new galaxies , ngc  300 and ngc  2403 , where we may learn about the timescales of hmxb formation at a metallicity that is higher than the smc and more characteristic of the older stars in galactic disks ( -0.7@xmath2[fe / h]@xmath2 - 0.3 , @xcite ) , which may play a role in early hmxb feedback @xcite .",

    "all photometry and artificial star tests were measured and performed as described by the angst project paper @xcite .",
    "briefly , all photometry was performed using dolphot , an updated version of hstphot optimized for acs photometry .",
    "photometry was culled based on signal - to - noise ratio and the quality parameters of sharpness and crowding , as described in @xcite .",
    "we selected only the photometry from a circular region with a radius of 50 pc around the positions of the hmxbs ( 5.1@xmath6 and 3.2@xmath6 in ngc  300 and ngc  2403 , respectively ) .",
    "the cmds of these regions are shown in figures  [ cmds1 ] and [ cmds2 ] .",

    "images of one source in each galaxy are given in figure  [ image ] , showing that the stellar density and extinction does not vary strongly within these relatively small spatial scales .",
    "we fit the color - magnitude diagrams for each of the fields in our study using the software package match @xcite .",

    "output star formation rates are renormalized to a @xcite initial mass function .",
    "furthermore , we find the best - fitting mean extinction to each location with the distance fixed to 2.0  mpc and 3.2  mpc for ngc  300 and ngc  2403 , respectively @xcite .",
    "we found the best fitting extinction to be consistent with the foreground value from @xcite .",
    "in addition , we attempted to improve the model fits by including differential reddening in the model hess diagrams by spreading the model photometry along the reddening line using the match dav flag ; however , we found no improvement and therefore no evidence for significant differential reddening in these locations , suggesting these are not extremely young active regions associated with o - type stars . with",
    "these distance and extinction values applied , we then run a series of 100 monte carlo ( mc ) tests .    to assess the full combination of systematic errors due to model deficiencies as well as random errors due to the depth and size of the sample , realizations of the best - fitting model solution are fitted with the models shifted in bolometric magnitude and effective temperature @xcite .",
    "these shifts account for the uncertainties due to any potential systematic offsets between the data and models .",
    "this total uncertainty was measured for one location to assess the total uncertainties in the rest of outer portions of the galaxy .",
    "when searching for differences between different locations in the same galaxy , systematic uncertainties due to offsets between the models and the data are not of concern , since these systematics will affect all fields .",
    "to estimate the _ relative _ uncertainty for differences between two location analyzed using the same models , we need only to assess the random errors due to the depth and size of the sample .",
    "therefore , for the other locations , our mc error analysis did not include shifts between the models and data .",
    "one interesting test case is ngc  2403 source 42 , which is a well - studied ulx that is thought to have a black hole primary @xcite .",
    "the black hole mass is estimated from _ suzaku _",
    "x - ray spectra to be 1015  m@xmath7 , assuming radiation near the eddington limit @xcite . there is no confirmed optical counterpart .",
    "our analysis suggests that it resides in a region with no stars younger than 50  myr , but with a significant population of stars with ages 60@xmath05  myr .",
    "since the progenitor of the black hole likely had a main sequence lifetime of @xmath210  myr , our result suggests that this ulx either has had a very long x - ray lifetime compared to the lifetime of the primary , or the ulx is so bright now because it has a secondary that is in a state of rapid mass - loss , as in the model of @xcite . _",
    "spitzer _ imaging from the sings @xcite program shows no obvious counterpart in the near or mid infrared , so it does not appear to be an ir - bright asymptotic giant branch star , shedding its envelope . in any case , if the ulx is associated with this 60  myr population , then the secondary likely has a zero - age main - sequence mass of @xmath27 m@xmath7 .      turning now to the broader sample , in figures  [ sfhs1 ] and [ sfhs2 ]",
    ", we show the recent star formation histories ( sfhs ) for the regions surrounding all 18 hmxb candidates . for reference , we highlight the age range between 30 and 60 myr .",
    "all but 3 ( n300 - 95 , n2403 - 39 , and n2403 - 85 ) show a significant peak in between 20 and 70 myr .",
    "one of these ( ngc2403 - 85 ) shows a population of 1020  myr , and therefore is still a potential hmxb .",
    "hmxbs are expected to appear in populations even younger than 1020 myr .",
    "the population synthesis models of @xcite show that substantial numbers of hmxbs appear 4 - 5 myr after the beginning of star formation . a possible evolutionary scenario for the formation of such an hmxb on a time scale of 5 - 6 myr",
    "is described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* assuming that the binary survives the first supernova ) .",
    "observationally , a case in point is provided by the galactic cluster westerlund  1 , which has an age of @xmath14  myr .",
    "this cluster has several wolf - rayet binaries ( potential progenitors of hmxbs ) , one candidate hmxb , and a magnetar , indicating that a number of compact objects have already formed from supernovae ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "n300 - 95 has a 100  myr population , pushing the old - age limits for an hmxb , and n2403 - 39 , while showing no significant population younger than 100 myr , has upper limits that allow the possibility of some young stars in the region .",
    "the x - ray sources in regions with very little recent star formation could also be lmxbs , since all of these regions also contain significant old populations .",
    "however , if for example , n2403 - 39 is an lmxb , then the counterpart is not the blue star that falls in the chandra error circle .",
    "when we combine the results from all of the candidates in our sample , as shown in figure  [ sum ] , we find a prominent enhancement in the age distribution at 4055 myr .",
    "this result provides more evidence that 4055 myr is a common age for hmxb systems , and therefore may represent the post star - formation epoch with the largest number of hmxbs per unit stellar mass formed .",
    "furthermore , this epoch would presumably also be the interval of maximum feedback from hmxb jets , outflows , and high - energy radiation .    to quantify the likelihood of such a peak in a summed age distribution appearing by chance",
    ", we fit photometry from a control sample . this control sample consisted of photometry drawn from 18 regions within 0.5@xmath6 of randomly drawn bright blue stars in the _ hst _ fields .",
    "we required the same number of regions per field as the hmxb sample .",
    "we ran these random locations through our fitting technique and summed the results , finding no clear peak in the age distribution ( figure  [ sum ] ) .",
    "we then ran this test 1000 times to see if we ever randomly recovered a peak similar to that seen in the age distribution of the hmxb sample .",
    "we found that 1.5% of our trials resulted in a peak of at least a factor of 2.35 in 2 adjacent bins between the ages of 20 and 140 myr ( as seen in the hmxb sample ) . a smaller number ( 0.4% ) of our trials had such peaks as old as the 4055  myr peak seen in the hmxb distribution .",
    "thus , a peak like that seen in the hmxb sample is a 3@xmath8 outlier in our trials , roughly consistent the with uncertainty estimates shown in figure  [ sum ] .",
    "the standard model of massive binary evolution suggests that in a massive binary ( e.g. b and o stars or a and o stars ) , the more massive star evolves first and transfers mass to the less massive companion when it overflows its roche lobe .",
    "the core of the massive star subsequently collapses , forming a neutron star or black hole .",
    "if the binary remains bound after the core - collapse supernova , it may become an hmxb ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    after mass accretion",
    ", the less massive star is spun up due to the addition of high angular momentum material @xcite , and subsequent evolution occurs at higher temperatures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the rapid rotation pushes the wind of this hot star into the equatorial plane and leads to the formation of an equatorial outflow disk @xcite , which makes this an active b - star ( be star ) .",
    "as this mass is transferred back to , and accreted by , the compact object , x - ray emission is produced and the binary becomes a be - hmxb @xcite .",
    "because the b - star is rapidly rotating , the mass outflow is localized in the equatorial plane .",
    "this `` outflow disk '' increases the mass transfer efficiency .",
    "the resulting x - ray luminosity is low a large fraction of the time ( @xmath910@xmath10 erg s@xmath11 ) .",
    "however , these systems can sometimes reach luminosities of 10@xmath12 erg  s@xmath11 because the outflow disk is unstable and can have episodes of enhanced outflow ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which lead to an increase in the accretion rate ( and x - ray luminosity ) of the compact object .    given this model of hmxb formation",
    ", one might expect a correspondence between hmxb ages and b - star evolution .",
    "observations suggest that the fraction of active b stars ( be stars ) peaks at 2580 myr @xcite .",
    "our measurements suggest that the fraction of hmxbs appears to peak at 4055  myr , in good agreement .",
    "thus , the activity cycle of b - stars appears to be involved in the observed peak in the age distribution .",
    "the 4055  myr timescale is also associated with a possible peak in the neutron star production rate .",
    "current theory and observations suggest that stars with zero age main - sequence masses of 78  m@xmath7 are the lowest mass stars to undergo core - collapse to form neutron stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "according to the initial mass function @xcite , for a given star forming episode , there are always more lower mass stars than higher mass ones",
    ". therefore the highest rate of core - collapse likely occurs when the lifetime of 78  m@xmath7 stars has been reached .",
    "this lifetime is 4055 myr according to , for example , the padova stellar evolution models @xcite .",
    "therefore , the production rate of neutron stars is likely involved in the observed peak in the age distribution as well .",
    "thus , both the mass - loss by b stars and the number of potential hmxb systems are at a maximum at @xmath150  myr after star formation , conspiring to form the peak that we see in the hmxb age distribution .",
    "recent attempts to include baryonic physics in galaxy formation models and simulations have found that the treatment of feedback , energy injection into the interstellar gas , plays an important role in shaping not only the mass function ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and star formation histories of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but also their dark matter halo density profiles @xcite . the necessary timescale and energetics of the feedback required to reproduce observed galaxy properties are complex , and as a result",
    ", the origin of the feedback remains controversial .",
    "at least part of the necessary feedback appears to be related to star formation , especially in low mass galaxies where no active nucleus is present .",
    "we note that the peak we observe in hmxb activity @xmath150 myr after star formation is generally consistent with hmxbs contributing significantly to the feedback resulting from star formation .",
    "for example , @xcite suggest that the cumulative energy input from hmxbs can be similar to that from sne , and they point out that hmxb feedback may have the appropriate delay time required to produce episodic star formation histories of low mass galaxies .",
    "our results suggest that feedback from hmxbs is maximized @xmath150  myr after star formation , roughly consistent with the delay time required by some models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , the delay between star formation and the transfer of sne energy into the ism is a similar length at low sn - rates @xcite , therefore both processes should be considered potentially important to the feedback budget .",
    "furthermore , @xcite recently discovered a correlation between the energetics of the neutral interstellar medium ( ism ) and the star formation rate 3040  myr earlier .",
    "this result suggests that the energy associated with star formation is transferred to the neutral ism with roughly this delay time .",
    "the consistency of this timescale with the delay time of hmxb feedback provides further evidence that feedback from both hmxbs and sne are potentially important for regulating star formation in low - mass galaxies .",
    "while the observed delay time between star formation and hmxb activity makes hmxb feedback potentially important in low - mass galaxies , the relatively low energies associated with hmxbs , makes them only minor contributors to feedback in more massive systems .",
    "massive galaxies contain supermassive black holes .",
    "central black holes have masses of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "assuming the energy released in producing the central black hole is @xmath14 , putting @xmath15 in units of ergs and @xmath16 in units of solar masses yields @xmath17 .",
    "we can also determine @xmath18 as a function of @xmath19 by assuming that @xmath20 , where @xmath21 has units of seconds , is equivalent to the x - ray luminosity ( @xmath22 ) , and setting @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the star formation rate in units of @xmath25 .",
    "we can now apply the relation between @xmath22 and @xmath26 from @xcite , which is @xmath27 , where @xmath22 is in units of erg  s@xmath11 and @xmath26 is in units of @xmath28 . substituting @xmath24 for @xmath26 yields @xmath29 ; then applying @xmath30 and @xmath31 gives @xmath32 .",
    "thus , @xmath33 , making @xmath18 a very minor contributor to the global evolution of massive galaxies .",
    "we have performed model fits to the color - magnitude distribution of the stars within 50  pc of hmxb candidates in ngc  300 and ngc  2403 that have adequate _ hst _ archival data .",
    "the ulx in ngc  2403 is one of these sources , and it appears to be associated with a population of 60@xmath05 myr in age . the total of the resulting recent star formation histories show a significant peak between 40 and 55 myr .",
    "this peak is coincident with the timescale for hmxb formation as seen in the smc . using these results",
    ", we can infer that n300 - 5 , n300 - 13 , n300 - 22 , n2403 - 22 , n2403 - 42 , n2403 - 44 , n2403 - 55 , n2403 - 57 , n2403 - 63 , n2403 - 69 , n2403 - 70 , and n2403 - 84 are the strongest hmxb candidates , and that the timescale for maximum hmxb activity is similar to that seen in the smc .",
    "the formation of an hmxb requires the production of a neutron star or black hole through a core - collapse supernova of the primary and mass - loss by the secondary to fuel the accretion process . due to a fortuitous coincidence , both the age of a population when b - star mass loss is at a maximum ( e.g. , *",
    "* ) and the age when neutron star production is a maximum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are @xmath150  myr .",
    "thus , the peak we observe in the hmxb age distribution strengthens recent observations and theory of the evolution of massive stars in binary systems .    finally , this timescale for the peak of hmxb activity after the onset of star formation may help to address some open questions in the interplay between star formation and galaxy evolution .",
    "first , it is consistent with the delay between star formation and feedback processes required by some models to reproduce episodic star formation in low - mass galaxies .",
    "second , it is consistent with the delay time between star formation and delivery of energy to the ism observed in nearby low - mass galaxies .",
