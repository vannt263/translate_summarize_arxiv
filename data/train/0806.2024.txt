    "rw tri is a bright well known eclipsing nova - like system .",
    "it was discovered by protitch in 1937 @xcite .",
    "@xcite determined the orbital period to be 5.57  h. @xcite found that eclipse timings demand that the ephemeris has a cyclic term with a period of 2777 or 4980 days .",
    "different authors give different values of the system inclination angle @xmath7 : 80@xmath8 @xcite , 82@xmath8 @xcite , 70.5@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the disc size is about 0.4@xmath6 where @xmath6 is the orbital separation .",
    "@xcite performed the first eclipse mapping of the system .",
    "they found that the temperature of the inner part of accretion disc is about 40000 k. also using the eclipse mapping technique , @xcite determined the mass accretion rate to be 3@xmath210@xmath9 m@xmath4 year@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite estimated the range for the primary and secondary stellar masses as 0.4 - 0.7 and 0.3 - 0.4 m@xmath4 respectively .",
    "@xcite using spectrophotometric data found that the mass accretion rate is about 10@xmath9 m@xmath4 year@xmath5 .",
    "trigonometric parallax determination with the hubble space telescope gave a distance of 341 pc to rw tri @xcite .",
    "in our paper we used aavso observations of rw tri eclipse , obtained by keith graham with a meade lx200 f/10 12 \" telescope and sbig st-9e ccd camera in _",
    "observations were obtained during the low luminosity state ( fig .  1 ) on jd 2453672 .",
    "the star brightness dropped from 12.6 to 13.7 mag in the _ v _ band for about 150 days .",
    "there are no outbursts observed during this state although the time interval between aavso visual measurements was sometimes longer than 25 days .",
    "this shows that the accretion disc temperature did not drop below the instability limit .",
    "the eclipse light curve is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "for our observations , the out - of - eclipse brightness of the system was 13.74@xmath10.06 mag and in the mid - eclipse the magnitude was 15.83@xmath10.04 mag .",
    "one can see that the eclipse is deep and flickering on the light curve is not significant .",
    "there is a small effect of the hotspot presence on the post eclipse light curve .",
    "the light curve before the eclipse does not show the typical hump usually associated with a bright spot .",
    "in such a way we can conclude that the outer part of accretion disc is optically thin and the main source of radiation in quiescent state is the central part of the accretion disc .    in this paper we used zero magnitude absolute fluxes , determined by @xcite to prepare our observations for the eclipse mapping procedures .",
    ", width=317 ]",
    "we applied a genetic algorithm eclipse mapping technique ( see @xcite for detailed description ) to calculate the eclipse map of the rw tri accretion disc . in our modification",
    "the accretion disc brightness is modeled with a distribution of radiating points in the orbital plane inside the roche lobe of the primary star .",
    "our technique looks for an optimal spatial distribution of the points to fit the observed eclipse light curve .",
    "the system flux is reconstructed here by summing of the brightness of points visible at different phases .    to remove smooth orbital brightness variations we used an polynomial approximation for the out - of - eclipse parts of the light curve .",
    "after that we divided the eclipse light curve by the aproximation values and scaled the result with the polynomial value at zero phase .    in our models we used system parameters taken from @xcite ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath7=75@xmath8 ) .",
    "one can see the normalized phase light curve of the eclipse with the fit and residuals in fig .  2 .",
    "to build the map of accretion disc we used a model with 300 radiating points .",
    "the corresponding smoothed map for the brightness distribution in the accretion disc is in fig .",
    "the solid line inside the roche lobe shows a ballistic stream trajectory .",
    "one can see that the brightest part of accretion disc is about 0.1@xmath6 in radius and the hotspot distance is about 0.17@xmath6 .",
    "we consider this value as the real size of accretion disc .     and",
    "the solid line is the ballistic trajectory of the accretion stream .",
    "spatial coordinates are in orbital separation units.,width=317 ]         and 10@xmath3 m@xmath4 year@xmath5 mass accretion rate .",
    "dashed line shows critical temperature above which gas is in steady accretion regime @xcite.,width=317 ]",
    "assuming the distance to the system to be 341 pc @xcite , we calculated the radial brightness temperature distribution in the disc and compared it with predictions of accretion disc models .",
    "interstellar extinction @xmath13=7.8@xmath210@xmath14 mag @xmath2 pc@xmath5 was taken using the value for the nearest object from @xcite . in fig.5",
    "the radial brightness temperature plot is shown .",
    "here we compare the observed distribution with that predicted for steady state solutions for accretion rates of 10@xmath9 and 10@xmath3 solar masses per year .",
    "our fit of the temperature distribution with that predicted from the steady state disc model gives the value @xmath15 = ( 3.85@xmath10.19)@xmath210@xmath3 m@xmath4 year@xmath5 .",
    "this result is close to that obtained from eclipse mapping by @xcite value @xmath15 = 3@xmath210@xmath3 m@xmath4 year@xmath5 .",
    "we fitted the observed temperature distribution with the function @xmath16 and found @xmath17 .",
    "our estimate of parameter @xmath18 is far from that predicted in the steady state model @xmath19 value . from fig . 5",
    "one can see that the temperature distribution consists of two different parts : for @xmath20 less than 0.14@xmath6 and for @xmath20 greater than this radius .",
    "if we fit these parts separately , we obtain values @xmath21 for @xmath220.14@xmath6 and @xmath23 for @xmath240.14@xmath6 .    our mass accretion rate estimate is less than that determined by the @xcite value of @xmath15 = 10@xmath25 m@xmath4 year@xmath5 . according to their data",
    "the temperature in the disc does not drop below the critical value , above which gas ramains in the steady state accretion regime , typical for classical nova - like systems .",
    "the dashed curve in fig.5 . shows the critical temperature level @xcite , calulated for the rw tri system parameters .",
    "one can see that the temperature drops below critical value immediately after the hotspot distance and , hence , the most probable accretion disc radius .",
    "it is enough for the accretion disc to remain in the steady state .",
    "using eclipse mapping techniques we calculated the radial brightness temperature distribution . for inner parts of accretion disc",
    "the slope of this distribution is close to the @xmath26 law . for outer parts",
    "the temperature distribution corresponds to a steady state @xmath0 law .",
    "we estimated the mass accretion rate in the system as @xmath15 = ( 3.85@xmath10.19)@xmath210@xmath3 m@xmath4 year@xmath5 .",
    "our results show that even during the low luminosity phase , disc remains in the hot steady state .",
    "we acknowledge with thanks the variable star observations from the aavso international database contributed by observers worldwide and used in this research .",
