    "in the papers @xcite the following monodromy problem is considered for the liouville theory on the sphere : given the singularities in the standard position @xmath1 and given the class i.e. the trace of the monodromy for a path encircling both singularities at @xmath2 and @xmath0 , find the value of the accessory parameter realizing such data .",
    "such a problem intervenes in the process of the classical limit of the quantum four - point function ; the value of trace of the above described monodromy is then fixed by a saddle point procedure @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the problem is solved by going over to the quantum formulation for the four - point function and taking the classical limit i.e. the limit in which the central charge goes to infinity . as the quantum conformal blocks are known as formal power series expansions in @xmath0 also the classical result so obtained is given as a formal power expansion in @xmath0 .",
    "the procedure goes through a process of exponentiation of the quantum conformal blocks after which the classical limit @xmath3 is taken ; in such a limit heavy cancellations take part @xcite . several analytic @xcite and numerical @xcite calculations , also exploiting recursion formulae @xcite for the conformal blocks , support the validity of such a calculational scheme .",
    "one suspects , on the other hand , that the same results should be obtainable just by exploiting the transformation properties of the ordinary differential equations which underlie the liouville theory at the classical level . in this note",
    "we shall in fact consider the problem directly at the classical level .",
    "in addition it appears that working without taking the singular limit in which the central charge goes to infinity one might control better the convergence region of the expansion of the accessory parameter as a function of the modulus @xcite .",
    "the approach followed in this paper consists in computing the monodromy along a contour embracing @xmath2 and @xmath0 through the usual convergent iteration expansion for the solution of the heun equation .",
    "the monodromy is computed along a contour which avoids the neighborhood of the origin where the kernel is singular and then we expand the result in @xmath0 .    in so doing one",
    "is faced to first order with the computation of integrals containing the product of two hypergeometric functions ; if one goes to the second order the product of four hypergeometric functions in a double integral appears .    in this paper",
    "we show how to compute analytically such integrals , which appear in the expansion of the solution of the volterra equation .",
    "the complete first order result gives as a byproduct the value of the accessory parameter which coincides with the one derived in @xcite and re - derived in @xcite .    for computing the integrals appearing in the first order result",
    ", we exploit the transformation property of the solution of the differential equation under @xmath4 . in the calculation of the second order such",
    "a technique is not sufficient and we need a non invertible transformation which at the infinitesimal level is related to the operator @xmath5 .",
    "contrary to the @xmath4 transformations this is not one - to - one in the complex plane .    on the other hand",
    "the procedure we shall describe , involves only the solutions along the real @xmath6 axis for @xmath7 , and there for @xmath8 the transformation is well defined .    after developing such tools",
    "we give the complete second order computation for the accessory parameter .",
    "in so doing we employ a formalism apt to be extended to higher order computation .",
    "the second order result agrees with the one obtained in @xcite by considering the classical limit of the quantum conformal blocks combined with the exponentiation hypothesis and thus it lends a strong support to the exponentiation hypothesis of the conformal blocks in the @xmath3 limit .",
    "we discuss also the extension of the procedure to higher orders .",
    "obviously , as the determination of the accessory parameter @xmath9 is always obtained through the solution of an implicit equation , the fact that the function @xmath10 which represents the energy momentum tensor , has radius of convergence @xmath11 in @xmath0 , for @xmath12 , does not assure that the expansion of @xmath9 in @xmath0 has the same radius of convergence . for achieving rigorous lower bounds on such a radius of convergence , methods",
    "similar to those developed in @xcite for the convergence in the coupling strength should be applied .",
    "the developed technique can also be applied to the problem of the punctured torus .",
    "the ordinary differential equation associated with the monodromy problem is @xmath13 with @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath9 is the accessory parameter to be fixed so that the monodromy along a contour encircling both @xmath2 and @xmath0 has trace @xmath16 and as such it will depend both on @xmath0 and @xmath17 .",
    "we have @xmath18 and @xmath9 is related to to one used in @xcite which we call @xmath19 , by @xmath20 and thus @xmath21 and @xmath22'|_{x=0 } -c(0)$ ] .    expanding in @xmath0 we have @xmath23",
    "@xmath24 it is our interest to compute the class of the monodromy along a circuit enclosing both the origin and @xmath0 .",
    "working near the origin is difficult due to the singular nature of the kernel .",
    "instead we shall compute the same monodromy along the circuit shown in fig.1 .",
    "the great advantage in performing such a change in the contour is the fact that the expansion in @xmath0 of @xmath10 along the contour is no longer singular and actually is convergent with convergence radius @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath25 will denote the complex @xmath26 being @xmath27 two independent solutions of @xmath28 , canonical at @xmath29 .",
    "they are given by @xmath30 @xmath31 the constant wronskian is easily computed at @xmath29 @xmath32    the unperturbed monodromy is computed as follows .",
    "we start from the @xmath25 for real @xmath6 , @xmath33 .",
    "the continuation to the upper side of the cut @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 @xmath36 whose asymptotic behavior for large @xmath6 is @xmath37 @xmath38 being a well known matrix @xmath39 similarly @xmath40 and @xmath41 we start from @xmath42 eq.([y- ] ) , whose continuation to the upper side of the cut is eq.([y+ ] ) . taking the turn of @xmath43 at infinity",
    "we go back to @xmath42 having encircled the origin and @xmath0 and we obtain the monodromy matrix to lowest order @xmath44 one easily checks that @xmath45 .",
    "the first order corrections to @xmath25 is provided by @xmath46 with @xmath47 @xmath48 . following the procedure illustrated above using ( [ firstiteration ] ) instead of the unperturbed @xmath25 we obtain the new monodromy matrix @xmath49 , @xmath50 with @xmath51 , and we have @xmath52 where @xmath53 @xmath54",
    "we have due to eqs.([y1t1+],[y2t2+],[y1t1y2t2- ] ) @xmath55 and thus @xmath56\\ ] ] and to determine @xmath57 we must impose @xmath58 .",
    "the second order result is obtained by iterating once the result with @xmath59 and adding also the contribution obtained by replacing in ( [ firstiteration ] ) @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "the computation of the first order result is reasonably simple .",
    "we shall adopt here a formalism which is apt to be extended to the second and higher order computation .",
    "we are faced to compute the integrals appearing in eqs.([delta11],[delta22 ] ) with @xmath62 given in eq.([qexpansion ] ) .",
    "more generally we shall compute analytically the indefinite integrals @xmath63 for @xmath64 and where @xmath65 and @xmath66 take the value @xmath11 and @xmath67 .    for @xmath68",
    "such integrals can be computed by exploiting the transformation properties under @xmath4 of the solutions .",
    "let us consider the equation @xmath69 @xmath70 the solutions of eq.([requation ] ) are @xmath71 and similarly for @xmath72 . then writing @xmath73 @xmath74 using @xmath75 and @xmath76 we have @xmath77 we find @xmath78    on the other hand the change @xmath17 into @xmath79 induces in @xmath80 the change @xmath81 leaving the singularities at @xmath29 and at @xmath82 unchanged .",
    "this time the related change @xmath83 is simply given by @xmath84 and we can again apply eq.([firstintegral ] ) replacing @xmath85 with @xmath86 . combining with ( [ firstintegrals ] )",
    "it provides us with the integrals of type ( [ generalintegrals ] ) with @xmath87 and with @xmath88 appearing in the first order computation , in terms of hypergeometric functions and derivatives thereof .",
    "the integrals appearing in ( [ delta11],[delta22 ] ) have the upper limit infinity , for which the derived formulae ( [ firstintegral ] ) also hold . as the asymptotic behavior of the hypergeometric functions",
    "are given @xcite by simple powers of @xmath6 multiplied by gamma functions , we have that such integrals are expressed in terms of the functions @xmath89 and @xmath90 , where @xmath91 .",

    "the equation which gives @xmath113 is provided by the vanishing of the coefficient of @xmath114 in the expansion of @xmath115 i.e. @xmath116 the second order change in the functions @xmath27 is given by the direct contribution due to @xmath117 and by the second iteration of the contribution of @xmath59 .",
    "with regard to the direct contribution we have to compute @xmath118 with @xmath119 given in eq.([qexpansion ] ) , where the new integrals @xmath120 appear . in the basis @xmath121 @xmath117",
    "is represented by the vector @xmath122 the @xmath123 can not be computed by performing an @xmath4 transformation .",
    "we shall exploit the new transformation @xmath124 and use the schwarzian transformation of @xmath125 and the @xmath126-form nature @xcite of the solutions @xmath127 .",
    "the above transformation gives rise to @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the schwarz derivative of the transformation and the new solutions are @xmath130    reverting to the @xmath6-notation for the variable and denoting with the dot the derivative w.r.t .",
    "@xmath131 we have @xmath132 with @xmath133 from eq.([tkva ] ) we have @xmath134 contrary to the @xmath4 transformations the transformation ( [ lm2transf ] ) is not one - to - one in the complex plane .",
    "nevertheless for @xmath135 the transformation is well defined , i.e. non singular along the line @xmath136 which is our range of application .",
    "we can then exploit again the integration formula ( [ firstintegral ] ) , with @xmath85 replaced by eq.([dottva ] ) and @xmath137 by @xmath138 of eq.([dotr ] ) .",
    "one can also verify the correctness of the result by taking explicitly the derivative w.r.t .",
    "@xmath6 of the obtained formula .",
    "we introduce the three dimensional vectors @xmath139 , with @xmath140 which represent the matrix elements of the variation of @xmath80 under respectively the transformation of eq.([requationr ] ) ( @xmath141 ) , the of eq.([deltanuchange ] ) ( @xmath142 ) and of the transformation of the above eq.([lm2transf ] ) ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "we have @xmath144 with @xmath145 and @xmath146 the inversion of eq.([tjk ] ) provides the values of the fundamental matrix elements @xmath147 , @xmath148 .",
    "we notice that the procedure can be extended to all values of @xmath149 by considering the variation of the equation @xmath150 under the transformation @xmath151 in addition due to the structure of the matrices @xmath152 such a procedure is purely iterative , i.e. known @xmath147 for @xmath153 the computation of @xmath154 , provides directly @xmath155 .",
    "in the present case we have @xmath156    we come now to the second iteration of @xmath59 .",
    "given the green function @xmath157 the expression we are confronted with , for the second order change of @xmath158 is @xmath159 with @xmath160 given by eq.([firstiteration ] ) .",
    "the indefinite integrals appearing in ( [ seconditeration ] ) can be obtained from the equation @xmath161 with @xmath162 where we shall impose @xmath163 with @xmath164 and @xmath57 given by eq.([c1 ] ) . in order to fit the coefficients of @xmath108 in @xmath59 we have to allow in principle for two parameters @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "we find @xmath167    notice that the transformation leading from @xmath168 to @xmath169 is of the same type as the one appearing in ( [ requation],[requationr ] ) of which we know the solutions .",
    "it follows that after replacing @xmath170 and @xmath57 in ( [ newq1 ] ) with their values , the simplest method to compute the matrix elements @xmath171 is to use the transformation ( [ simpleshift ] ) with @xmath131 replaced by @xmath172 .",
    "one can easily prove that @xmath173 has the correct boundary condition @xmath174 with coefficient @xmath11 at @xmath29 , as imposed by the solution of the volterra equation and thus @xmath175 equals @xmath176 i.e. it is the first order correction to @xmath177 .",
    "it is expressed in terms of derivatives of the hypergeometric function .",
    "the same holds for @xmath178 .",
    "then the integrals @xmath179 appearing in ( [ seconditeration ] ) can be computed as follows . using @xmath180 and @xmath181 we have @xmath182",
