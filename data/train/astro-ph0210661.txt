    "the case for measuring pulsar parallaxes is strong  many models based on other measurements of pulsars require estimates of the distances to the pulsars in the sample .",
    "applications of pulsar distances are not within the scope of this paper as they are discussed in detail by chatterjee in the following paper .",
    "this paper concentrates on making useful measurements of pulsars with vlbi and focuses mainly on high - precision astrometry .",
    "interferometry is the radio astronomers answer to the optical astronomer s resolution .",
    "building large single centimeter - wave telescopes with resolutions that come close to those of large optical telescopes is impossible . at 1.5  ghz",
    ", the dish would need to be 20  km in diameter  quite a mechanical feat .",
    "even if such a marvel could be constructed , the ionosphere and troposphere could not be expected to be coherent over the entirety of the aperture .",
    "fortunately phase - preserving amplifiers and stable electronics are available in the gigahertz frequencies which allow the electrical combination of signals from many small antennas . also important",
    "is that the radio photons are in the classical regime with occupation numbers much greater than unity , which allows amplification and duplication of the signals without a large sensitivity penalty .",
    "once one can combine the signals from many small antennas , one can use aperture synthesis to probe features smaller than a milliarcsecond .",
    "vlbi is probably best distinguished from connected - element interferometry by its scale  thousands of kilometers , typically .",
    "the distance and geographic barriers require the sampled electric field measurements to be recorded onto ( usually magnetic ) media to be shipped from the antennas to a central correlator and the use different clocks at each station which must be stable and synchronized to better than microsecond precision",
    ". it also requires use of very detailed correlator models , especially for astrometric projects .",
    "these models include effects such as bending of light around the sun and jupiter , tidal deformation of the earth , excursions from earth s average spin , and plate tectonic motion .",
    "this model is used to calculate , to 10  ps or better accuracy , the expected geometric delay between the arrivals of the radiation from an astronomical source at the antennas .",
    "the input parameters to the model include station positions , the time of the observation , and coordinates of the source being observed ( the phase center ) .",
    "the data products of the correlator are the cross - correlations of the signals from each pair of stations after taking into account the modeled delay .",
    "these are called visibilities .",
    "this paper will not focus on scattering , however for completeness i include a brief discussion .",
    "vlbi with its high angular resolution can measure the scattering disc size , constraining the distribution of scattering material along the line of sight to the source .",
    "scattering increases strongly ( as @xmath0 ) with wavelength .",
    "while an image that exhibits the scattering disc can be reconstructed with the set of visibilities measured for a source , a more accurate measurement can be made by modeling the visibilities directly .",
    "the amplitude of a visibility is the flux density of the source being observed multiplied by the correlation coefficient , which for a point source would be unity .",
    "earth rotation causes the projected antenna separations ( baseline lengths ) to change , probing a wide range of baselines .",
    "a detection of a scattering disc manifests itself as a drop in the correlation coefficient as a function of baseline length",
    ". the scattering - based decorrelation phenomenon can be useful for probing the ism , but is generally a nuisance for vlbi at low frequencies as it reduces the effective resolution .",
    "astrometry is the science of making precision measurements of positions of astronomical sources .",
    "multi - epoch astrometry leads to measurements of proper motions and perhaps parallaxes .",
    "the phases of the complex visibilities contain astrometric information . in the absence of correlator model errors or other deviations from perfect calibration ,",
    "the visibility phase for a point source is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the speed of light , @xmath3 is the observing frequency , @xmath4 is the projected baseline vector , and @xmath5 is the displacement vector of the source relative to the correlator model phase center . for a source that is exactly at the correlator phase center ,",
    "this phase is zero . with multiple measurements of @xmath6 made with different projected baselines , @xmath4 , the source position , @xmath5 ,",
    "can be obtained .",
    "pulsar vlbi measurements are made almost exclusively in the 20  cm observing band .",
    "pulsars have steep spectral indexes , making observing at higher frequencies more difficult . the ionosphere , scattering , interference , and lower angular resolution all contrive to make observing at frequencies below 1  ghz difficult .",
    "pulsar gating is often employed to improve the signal - to - noise of the pulsar measurements . gating disables accumulation in the correlator during a pulsar s off - pulse phase .",
    "the ionosphere , just like the ism , contains a non - homogeneous distribution of electrons which impart a dispersive delay to the incoming radiation .",
    "the ionosphere above each station can change substantially on timescales less than 1  minute , causing the relative phases to change , corrupting the astrometry .",
    "the bulk of this can be removed by a technique known as phase - referencing ( shapiro et al .",
    "1979 ) . in this process , a nearby point - like calibrator source with a well known position",
    "is observed alternately with the target with a cycle time of 2 to 4 minutes .",
    "since the calibrator s position is well known , its visibility phases can be assumed to be purely due to calibration problems .",
    "these phases are then interpolated across the pulsar s observation and subtracted from the pulsar s corresponding visibility phases .",
    "this standard observing technique calibrates away most of the ionosphere s effect , but the uncorrected ionosphere gradients often leave significant and systematic phase errors .",
    "after phase - referencing at frequencies lower than about 5  ghz , the remaining phase errors are dominated by the effects of the ionosphere .",
    "the dispersive nature of the ionosphere can be exploited in its removal .",
    "the unwanted phase as a function of frequency for a given visibility can be expressed as @xmath7 where b is the strength of the uncalibrated ionosphere .",
    "the phase - referenced visibility phase then has the form @xmath8 the difference in frequency dependence of the first , wanted term and the second , unwanted term make it possible to measure @xmath9 and remove its effect from the visibility phase , allowing precise astrometry .",
    "additional details of this technique and a discussion of its applicability can be found in brisken et al .",
    "( 2000 & 2002 ) .",
    "a project to measure the parallaxes of 10 pulsars was started in 1999 after success of this technique was demonstrated on pulsar b0950 + 08 ( brisken et al .",
    "2000 ) . in this experiment ,",
    "the nrao very long baseline array ( vlba ) was used in the 14001730  mhz band .",
    "eight frequency sub - bands , each 8 mhz wide , were placed across 330  mhz .",
    "five epochs of observation were planned for each pulsar over the course of one year .",
    "one pulsar , j2145 - 0750 , was not detected in either of its first two epochs and was subsequently abandoned .",
    "successful parallax measurements were made for the nine remaining pulsars with a typical precision of 100 microarcseconds ( brisken et al .",
    "see table  [ tab : parallaxes ] for the results .",
    "a second method to improve phase - referencing is to use a phase - reference calibrator source that is very close to the target . in the case",
    "that a compact source of sufficient flux density ( about 5  mjy for the vlba ) is within the same primary beam as the target ( about 25  arcminutes for the vlba at @xmath10  cm ) , both can be observed simultaneously . at correlation time , each source is correlated separately with its own phase center .",
    "the simultaneous observation of the calibrator and target mean that no temporal interpolation is needed and the spatial proximity implies that ionospheric gradients contribute little to the phase - referenced visibility phase .",
    "finding a suitable in - beam calibrator is often difficult or impossible",
    ". once a good calibrator is found , a successful parallax measurement is almost guaranteed .",
