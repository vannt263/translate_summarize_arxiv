    "however , electrons from the semileptonic decay of @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons are seen to be suppressed at nearly the same level as @xmath3s out to the highest measured @xmath2 , @xmath610  gev/@xmath7  @xcite .",

    "single particle yield measurements provide information on the overall deviation of particle production from @xmath0+@xmath0 expectations . however , the observed high-@xmath2 spectra are thought to be dominated by particles that have lost less than the average amount of energy , either due to a short path length through the matter or by a fluctuation . in order to get more detailed information about the interactions between the particles and the matter two - particle azimuthal correlations",

    "these correlations are characterized by two back - to - back jet peaks  @xcite . at small azimuthal angular difference , @xmath8 , particles are from the fragmentation of the same jet ; at @xmath9 particles are from the fragmentation of partons in the opposing jet .    in heavy - ion collisions",
    ", these correlations can provide information about the pattern of energy loss for the back - to - back dijet system as well as other interactions between the fast partons and the medium .",
    "measurements of hadrons associated with a high-@xmath2 hadron have shown the away - side correlations from back to back dijets to be significantly suppressed  @xcite .",
    "measurements of the correlations of electrons from heavy - flavor decay with other hadrons in the event can also provide insight into heavy - flavor energy loss and how this compares to @xmath3 and direct photon triggered correlations where the modifications could be different due to the different partons probing the matter .",
    "this is crucial for building a quantitative understanding of the nature of the interactions between hard partons and the produced hot matter .",
    "in addition , a strong broadening and double peak ( shoulder ) structure of away - side correlations at moderate @xmath2 has been observed  @xcite .",
    "many theoretical ideas have been proposed to explain this modification , including erenkov gluon radiation  @xcite , large angle gluon radiation@xcite and mach shock - waves  @xcite .",
    "measurements of the shoulder structure with particles from the fragmentation of heavy quarks , especially bottom , are interesting because at moderate momenta the quark velocity will be much smaller than the speed of light , in contrast to light quarks where @xmath10c at all jet momenta . in a mach shock - wave scenario the cone angle of the double peak structure away from @xmath11 , ( @xmath12 ) , is related to the speed of the parton by : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the speed of sound in the matter and @xmath15 is the speed of the parton as it propagates through the matter .",
    "it has been proposed that double - peaked correlations that do not obey mach s law could favor strongly - coupled ads / cft string drag scenarios  @xcite , or transverse flow  @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation based on geometrical fluctuations in the initial state leading to triangular flow has also recently been proposed  @xcite .",

    "the powheg monte carlo calcualtion  @xcite , which includes 2@xmath203 processes , also shows substantial contributions to the away - side correlations from gluons .",
    "thus , in order to measure @xmath21 or @xmath22 correlations one should identify the heavy quark in both the trigger and away jets .",
    "for the present purposes , this means it is not possible to identify the jet opposing the electron from heavy - flavor decay unambiguously as also from heavy - quark fragmentation .",
    "this complicates the interpretation of the present measurements .",
    "however , the comparison of heavy- and light - flavor triggered correlations can still provide a crucial step toward understanding fast parton propagation through the matter .    in the present work heavy - flavor electrons",
    "are those from the decay of both @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons .",
    "the relative contribution of electrons from bottom to the total heavy - flavor electron yield changes with the @xmath2 of the electron and has been measured in @xmath0+@xmath0 collisions to be from @xmath61050% for 1.0@xmath236.0  gev/@xmath7  @xcite .",

    "we outline the analysis procedure used ; in section  [ results ] we show the results in @xmath0+@xmath0 and au+au collisions ; and in section  [ conclusions ] we conclude and discuss the prospects for future measurements .",
    "these results are based on 1.1 billion level-1 triggered @xmath0+@xmath0 events sampling 8.0  @xmath24 taken during the 2006 rhic running period and 2.6 billion minimum bias au+au events , corresponding to 0.41  @xmath25 taken during the 2007 rhic running period .",
    "the events were triggered by a hit in each of two beam - beam counters ( bbc ) at 3.1@xmath263.9 and the interaction is required to be within 25  @xmath27 of the center of the interaction region .",
    "the @xmath0+@xmath0 level-1 triggered sample also required an energy deposit of approximately 1.4  gev in an overlapping tile of 4x4 emcal towers in coincidence with the bbc trigger .",
    "emcal towers are @xmath28 . in au+au collisions",
    "the event centrality is measured by the charge seen in the beam - beam counters ( bbc )  @xcite .",
    "the charged particle tracks and photons used in this analysis are measured in the phenix central arm spectrometers .",
    "electrons are measured between 1.5 and 4.5gev/@xmath7 and charged hadrons are measured between 0.5 and 4.5gev/@xmath7 .",
    "phenix has two such spectrometers , east and west arms , each covering @xmath29  rad in azimuth and @xmath300.35 .",
    "this analysis uses in each arm a drift chamber ( dc ) , two layers of pad chambers ( pc1 and pc3 ) , a ring imaging erenkov detector ( rich ) , and an electromagnetic calorimeter ( emcal ) . charged particles ( both electrons and hadrons ) are reconstructed in the dc and pc1 .",
    "electron identification is done by requiring two ( three ) associated hits in the rich for @xmath0+@xmath0 ( au+au ) , a shower shape cut in the emcal and an @xmath31 cut , where @xmath32 is the energy of the cluster in the emcal and @xmath0 is the track momentum determined by the dc .",

    "photons are identified by a shower shape cut in the emcal and a veto in the pc3 to reject charged tracks .",
    "hadron contamination in the photon sample is less than 4% .",
    "cuts on electron - hadron and photon - hadron pairs are also used to equalize the pair acceptance between real and mixed pairs and remove pairs that share hits in the various detector subsystems .    in the au+au running period",
    "the hadron blind detector ( hbd )  @xcite was installed for a commissioning run between the beam collision vertex position and the central arms .",
    "photon conversions in the detector material were an additional source of background electrons in the inclusive electron sample .",
    "the hbd in front of the west arm was absent for a substantial portion of the running period .",
    "we make the additional requirement that electrons from the 2007 running period are reconstructed in the west arm and select events only from the running period where the hbd in front of the west arm was removed in order to reduce the number of photon conversions .      in two particle correlations",
    "there is a combinatorial background due to pairs where the particles are uncorrelated except by event - wise correlations , such as centrality and the reaction plane in au+au or the underlying event in @xmath0+@xmath0 collisions .",
    "this background is very large in central au+au collisions and much smaller in @xmath0+@xmath0 collisions . in au+au collisions",

    "@xcite ) is used to subtract the @xmath8 independent underlying event . in the absolute background subtraction method",
    "the combinatorial background yield is determined from the centrality dependence of the single particle yields .",
    "the principal advantages of this method for this analysis are that the background uncertainty is not subject to statistical fluctuations caused by the small number of electron - hadron pairs and no assumption is made about the shape of the pair @xmath8 distribution .    in @xmath0+@xmath0 collisions the underlying event independent of @xmath8 .",
    "however , in au+au collisions there are additional correlations due to elliptic flow , @xmath34",
    ". these correlations do not affect the magnitude of the combinatorial background , but do affect the azimuthal correlation of particles .",
    "the @xmath34 values used in this analysis are measured using the reaction plane as determined from the phenix reaction plane detector and the same particle cuts used in the correlation analysis .",
    "results are reported as conditional yields of hadrons associated with trigger electrons after combinatorial background subtraction , @xmath35 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the total number of observed trigger particles and @xmath38 is the reconstruction efficiency for the associated hadrons as determined by a geant based monte carlo simulation and embedding single particles into real events .",

    "studies of electrons from open heavy - flavor decay are complicated by the background of electrons from light meson decay , photon conversions and , at higher @xmath2 , quarkonia and drell - yan . in this analysis",
    "we statistically subtract the correlations from these background sources using a method similar to that used to measure direct photon - hadron correlations  @xcite .",
    "the yield of inclusive electron - hadron pairs per electron trigger , the conditional yield @xmath40 , is measured .",
    "this is a weighted average of the conditional yield of hadrons associated with electrons from heavy - flavor decay and the conditional yield of hadrons associated with electrons from the background sources ( the dependencies on @xmath2 and @xmath8 are omitted hereafter for simplicity ) : @xmath41 where @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) is the number of electrons from heavy - flavor decay ( background sources ) .",

    "@xmath47 can be determined by comparing the measured electron yields to the known sources of background electrons .",
    "the @xmath48 determination is based on measured and simulated azimuthal correlations of the sources of background electrons and is described in detail below .",
    "the @xmath47 value giving the composition of the electron triggers into heavy - flavor and background sources is taken from the published phenix measurements  @xcite for the electron @xmath2 bins used in this analysis .",
    "based on simulations the @xmath47 has been decreased to account for extra air conversions due to the removal , in both the @xmath0+@xmath0 and au+au data samples , of the helium bag , which was installed during the data taking periods of refs .",
    "the removal of the he bag added 0.65% of a radiation length to the material in front of the tracking system .",
    "however , the reconstruction efficiency of the electrons from these air conversions decreases with the distance from the interaction point .",
    "this was simulated using a geant - based description of the phenix detector and the electron - identification cuts described above .",
    "additionally , electrons due to quarkonia decay are included in the background sample  @xcite , further reducing @xmath47 .",
    "the reduction due to quarkonia is determined by @xmath49 measurements and simulations of the decay  @xcite .",
