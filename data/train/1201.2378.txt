    "the so - called cosmic distance duality relation ( cddr )  @xcite , which is closely connected with the etherington reciprocity theorem  @xcite , plays an important role in observational cosmology ranging from gravitational lensing studies , galaxy and galaxy clusters observations , to analyses of the cosmic microwave blackbody radiation ( cmb)@xcite .",
    "it relates the luminosity distance @xmath4 with the angular diameter distance @xmath5 through the identity @xmath6    the above result can be easily demonstrated for usual friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker cosmologies . as is well known , it only requires source and observer to be connected by null geodesics in a riemannian spacetime and cosmological conservation of the number of photons  @xcite .",
    "examples of non - standard scenarios that violate the equality ( [ rec3 ] ) are models in which photons do not travel on unique null geodesics , models with variations of fundamental constants or with photon non - conservation due to coupling to particles beyond the standard model of particle physics , absorption by dust , etc .",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "attempts to actually test the cddr validity from astronomical observations have started only recently @xcite .",
    "for instance , in ref .  @xcite it was argued that the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) plus x - ray technique for measuring galaxy cluster distances is strongly dependent on the cddr validity . as is well known , one can consider different electronic density dependencies combined with some assumptions about the galaxy cluster morphology in order to evaluate its angular diameter distance with basis on eq .",
    "( [ rec3 ] ) , i.e. @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the angular diameter distance to a given galaxy cluster obtained directly from a jointly analysis of its sze and x - ray surface brightness observations , @xmath9 is the central x - ray surface brightness , @xmath10 is the central temperature of the intra - cluster medium , @xmath11 is the central x - ray cooling function of the intra - cluster medium , @xmath12 is the central decrement temperature , and @xmath13 refers to a characteristic scale of the cluster along the line of sight ( l.o.s . ) , whose exact meaning depends on the assumptions adopted to describe the galaxy cluster morphology .",
    "however , if one assumes a more general expression for cddr , such that , @xmath14 it is possible to show that ( for details see @xcite ) @xmath15 therefore , @xmath8 reduces to the real angular diameter distance only when the dd relation is strictly valid ( @xmath16 ) . in order to quantify the @xmath3 parameter , the authors in ref.@xcite fixed @xmath17 by using the cosmic concordance model @xcite while for @xmath18 they considered the 18 galaxy clusters from the ref.@xcite for which a spherically symmetric cluster geometry has been assumed . by assuming @xmath3 constant , their statistical analysis provided @xmath19 ( 1@xmath20 ) , and is therefore only marginally consistent with the standard result .",
    "on the other hand , the cddr should be tested only from astronomical observations , i.e. , finding cosmological sources whose intrinsic luminosities and intrinsic sizes are known .",
    "thus , after measuring the source redshift , one can determine both @xmath4 and @xmath5 to test directly the relation . in principle , this ideal method should not use any relationship coming from a specific cosmological model , i.e. , they must be determined by means of intrinsic astrophysical quantities only .    in recent papers",
    ", the validity of the cddr has been discussed using @xmath21 measurements from galaxy clusters ( gc ) and luminosity distances from type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) @xcite . in such analyses , subsamples of gc and sne ia",
    "are built so that differences in redshift between objects in each sample are small ( @xmath22 ) , thereby allowing a validity test of the cddr .",
    "there are , however , at least three aspects that should be considered when performing this kind of analysis . first , that estimates of @xmath3 from this method are potentially contaminated by different systematics error sources in gc and sne ia observations .",
    "second , that some sne ia light curve fitters use a specific cosmological scenario in their calibration process , which makes the gc / sne ia test not completely model - independent ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion on influence of the sne ia light curve fitters on the cddr test )",
    ". finally , that the use of different objects to derive @xmath4 and @xmath5 implies necessarily in a choice for @xmath23 , which affects the resulting estimates of the @xmath3 parameter ( see @xcite for a recent discussion .",
    "see also  @xcite for an interesting model - independent cddr test based on future observations of a redshifted 21 cm signal from disk galaxies ) .    in order to circumvent these observational problems ,",
    "we propose a consistent model - independent test for eq .",
    "( [ rec3 ] ) that uses only current observations of the gas mass fraction of gc s . to perform our analysis",
    ", we use a sample of @xmath1 and @xmath0 measurements of 38 gc s as discussed in ref .",
    "we show that when the cddr is taken into account current @xmath1 and @xmath0 measurements provide a direct test for the cddr .",
    "the gas mass fraction is defined as @xmath24 @xcite , where @xmath25 is the total mass obtained via hydrostatic equilibrium assumption and @xmath26 ( gas mass ) is obtained by integrating the gas density model .",
    "the gas density model frequently used is the 3-dimensional electron number density of the spherical @xmath27 model given by @xcite data for the non - isothermal double @xmath27-model in our statistical analyses .",
    "the spherical @xmath27 model is used in this section only for simplicity but without loss of generality for the test proposed . ]",
    "@xmath28 where @xmath29 is the electron number density , @xmath30 is the radius from the center of the cluster , @xmath31 is the core radius of the intracluster medium ( icm ) , and @xmath27 is a power law index . under this assumption , @xmath32 and @xmath26",
    "are given by @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the temperature of the intra cluster medium , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are , respectively , the total mean molecular weight and the proton mass , @xmath37 the boltzmann constant , and @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the mean molecular weight of the electrons .    the x - ray surface brightness over some frequency band is written as @xmath42 where the integral is along the line of sight and @xmath43 is the x - ray cooling function , proportional to @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "note that the above equation depends explicitly on the ratio between the angular diameter and luminosity distances .",
    "thus , if the cddr is taken as valid [ @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ rec3 ] ) ] and a fiducial angular diameter distance , @xmath46 , is assumed , the central electron density @xmath47 can be analytically obtained , i.e. , @xcite @xmath48 providing the well - known relation in current x - ray gas mass fraction measurements @xmath49  @xcite ( in the above expression @xmath50 is the central surface brightness and @xmath51 is the gamma function )",
    ".    however , if the validity of the cddr is not previously assumed ( @xmath52 ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : xray_ne0 ] ) is now rewritten as @xmath53 which clearly shows that gas mass fraction measurements extracted from x - ray data are affected by a possible violation of the cddr scaling as @xmath54         0.1 in      the measured temperature decrement @xmath55 of the cmb due to the sunyaev - zeldovich effect @xcite is given by @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 k is the present - day temperature of the cmb , @xmath58 the thompson cross section , @xmath59 the electron mass and @xmath60 accounts for frequency shift and relativistic corrections  @xcite .",
    "it worth mentioning that the gas temperature , @xmath61 , is insensitive to the validity of the cddr since it is obtained through the shape of the x - ray spectra ( bremsstrahlung spectra ) and not through x - ray luminosity .    using sze observations ,",
    "the central electron density can now be expressed as    @xmath62    which is insensitive to the validity of the cddr .",
    "therefore , current gas mass fraction measurements via sze depend only on the angular diameter distance as @xmath63      current @xmath1 measurements have been obtained by assuming the validity of the cddr  @xcite . if , however , this is not the case , the real gas mass fraction from x - ray observations ( eq.(11 ) ) should be related with the current observations by @xmath65 .",
    "so , if all the physics behind the x - ray and sze observations are properly taken into account , one would expect @xmath66 measurements from both tecniques to agree with each other since they are measuring the very same physical quantity . in this way , it is clear that the general expression relating current x - ray and sze observations is given by : @xmath67 which provides a direct test for the cddr . since the above expression holds for a given object , a possible influence on the @xmath3 estimates due to redshift differences of distinct objects ( e.g. , in tests involving sne ia and gc )",
    "is fully removed .    before discussing our estimates on the @xmath3 parameter from the above relation ,",
    "it is worth mentioning that in both methods to test the cddr ( the one of eq .",
    "( [ relation ] ) and those using @xmath21 measurements of galaxy clusters from their sze and x - ray observations  @xcite ) other physical effects could be present in the sze observations , leading to results with @xmath52 that not necessarily would be related to a cddr violation in x - ray frequency . for instance , as mentioned earlier [ see eq . ( 13 ) ] , sze observations are independent of the cddr validity .",
    "however , these observations are redshift - independent only if there is no process of energy injection into the cmb .",
    "otherwise , the standard linear relation of the cmb temperature evolution , @xmath68 , is not valid  @xcite and changes are needed in eqs .",
    "( 12 ) and ( 13 ) . in this line",
    ", there are recent analyses testing the standard evolution of the cmb temperature through different techniques by using a more general expression such as @xmath69 @xcite . as a basic result ,",
    "all analyses confirm the standard relation , i.e. , @xmath70 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for recent constraints on @xmath27 value by using sze observations and carbon monoxide excitation at high-@xmath71 ) .",
    "in what follows , we explore eq .",
    "( [ relation ] ) and discuss constraints on the cddr from current x - ray and sze gas mass fraction measurements .",
    "to discuss the potential of eq .",
    "( [ relation ] ) in probing the cddr , we use the most recent x - ray and sze gas mass fraction measurements to date , as given in ref .",
    "the sample consists of 38 massive galaxy clusters spanning redshifts from 0.14 up to 0.89 whose x - ray data were obtained from the chandra x - ray observatory and sze data from the bima / ovro sze imaging project , which uses the berkeley - illinois - maryland association ( bima ) and owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) interferometers to image the sze . in order to perform a realistic model for the cluster gas distribution and take into account a possible presence of cooling flow , the gas density was modeled with the non - isothermal double @xmath27-model that generalizes the single @xmath27-model profile given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : single_beta ] ) .",
    "another important aspect worth mentioning is that the shape parameters of the gas density model ( @xmath72 and @xmath27 ) were obtained from a joint analysis of the x - ray and sze data  @xcite , which makes the sze gas mass fraction not independent .",
    "however , as has been shown from current simulations  @xcite , the values of @xmath72 and @xmath27 computed separately by sze and x - ray observations agrees at @xmath73 level within a radius @xmath74 ( at which the mean enclosed mass density is equal to 2500 cosmological critical density ) , the same used in the la roque _ et al .",
    "_ observations .",
    "therefore , we believe that , unless a violation of the cddr may affect even the shape parameters obtained from the x - ray data ( and not only @xmath50 ) , one can use the la roque _ et al .",
    "_ sample to perform the method discussed earlier . in figure",
    "1a we show the sample of 38 measurements of the gas mass fraction of galaxy clusters obtained via x - ray surface brightness ( assuming @xmath45 ) and the sze ( see also table 5 of ref .",
    "we modify the cddr to test for any violation by using simple parameterizations for @xmath3 . in order to take into account a possible influence of different @xmath3 parameterizations on the results , we use in our analyses two functions  @xcite : @xmath75",
    "p1 is a continuous and smooth one - parameter linear expansion , whereas p2 includes a possible epoch - dependent correction , which avoids the divergence at very high @xmath71 .",
    "note also that , differently from constant @xmath3 parameterizations ( e.g. , @xmath76",
    "@xcite ) , both p1 and p2 recover the cddr in the limit @xmath77 , as obtained from cosmographic derivations .",
    "we evaluate our statistical analysis by defining the likelihood distribution function @xmath78 , where @xmath79 } ^{2}}{\\sigma^{2}_{i , obs}},\\ ] ] @xmath80 and @xmath81 is the uncertainty associated to this quantity .",
    "also , the @xmath82 index indicates the sum over each cluster . in fig .",
    "1b we plot our first constraints on the cddr from eq .",
    "( [ relation ] ) . by considering all 38 galaxy clusters of the sample discussed earlier ,",
    "we show the likelihood distribution as a function of the parameter @xmath83 for p1 ( blue solid line ) and p2 ( red dashed line ) .",
    "for these two cases , we find @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) and @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) at 1@xmath20 level , respectively .",
    "note that the cddr ( @xmath88 ) is slightly compatible with theses data , being @xmath89 off from the best - fit values in both cases .",
    "for the sake of completeness and also to verify the effect of the gas modelling on the results , we also performed the same analysis using the isothermal @xmath27 model . in this case , we obtained @xmath90 and @xmath91 at @xmath92 level for the linear and non - linear parametrizations , respectively .",
    "an important aspect concerning the galaxy cluster sample shown in fig .",
    "1a is that some objects present questionable reduced @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) when described by the hydrostatic equilibrium model ( see table 6 in ref .",
    "they are : abell 665 , zw 3146 , rx j1347.5 - 1145 , ms 1358.4 + 6245 , abell 1835 , macs j1423 + 2404 , abell 1914 ,",
    "abell 2163 , abell 2204 . by excluding these objects from our sample ( we end up with a subsample of 29 galaxy clusters )",
    ", we perform a new analysis whose results are displayed in fig .",
    "we note that , when compared with the previous analysis ( fig .",
    "1b ) , the compatibility of the data with the cddr is clearly more evident now , with @xmath95 ( p1 ) and @xmath96 ( p2 ) at 1@xmath20 level .",
    "it is worth observing that for all analyses performed in this paper a negative value for the cddr parameter was prefered by the data ( although the data are fully consistent with @xmath88 ) . a possible explanation for that has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite in terms of cosmic opacity or the existence of axion - like and mini - charged particles ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent review on these weakly - interacting - sub - ev particles ) . in table",
    "i we summarize the main results of our analyses .",
    "p1 @xmath97 & 1.02 + p2 @xmath98 & 1.04 + 29 galaxy clusters data & @xmath99 + p1 @xmath100 & 0.93 + p2 @xmath101 & 0.92 +    [ table1 ]",
    "in this _ letter _ , we have discussed how current measurements of gas mass fraction of galaxy clusters from x - ray and sze effect observations can be used to test the cddr . we have shown that if this relation is consistently taken into account current @xmath1 and @xmath0 measurements are related by @xmath2 [ eq .",
    "( [ relation ] ) ] , allowing a direct test for the cddr .    to perform our analyses",
    "we have considered two distinct forms for @xmath102 , i.e. , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , which recover the equality between @xmath105 and @xmath21 at very low redshifts . by considering 38 gas mass fraction measurements of galaxy clusters obtained from their sze and x - ray emissions ,",
    "we have found no significant influence of the above @xmath102 parameterizations on the results and that a no violation of the cddr is compatible at @xmath92 level .",
    "however , if our sample is corrected to account for possible statistical error sources due to galaxy cluster modeling , a value compatible with the validity of the cddr is found ( see table i ) .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that , irrespective of the fiducial model adopted in observations , @xmath66 measurements from both tecniques ( @xmath106 and @xmath107 ) for a given cluster must agree and if they do not the detected difference must be associated with the duality parameter @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the method here proposed is cosmological model - independent and also presents a clear advantage over tests involving different kinds of observations ( e.g. , gc and sne ia ) since the above relation is analyzed for the same object in a given sample .",
    "we believe that when applied to upcoming observational data the method discussed here may be useful to probe a possible violation of the cddr .",
