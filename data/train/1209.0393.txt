    "the recent discovery of a particle consistent with the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson , announced by the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite collaborations at cern , is a milestone in particle physics ; adding in quadrature statistical and systematic errors , the mass of the particle turns out to be in the range @xmath1 gev at @xmath2 .",
    "here we assume that the new particle is actually the sm higgs boson and study the implications that its mass value , together with other relevant parameters such as the top quark mass and the strong gauge coupling , has on the behavior of the higgs potential at very high energy scales and , in particular , for the sake of electroweak vacuum stability .",
    "the project of extrapolating the higgs potential up to the planck scale is a long standing one @xcite , and was revamped in the fall of 2011@xcite after the first lhc hints of a higgs boson were reported@xcite .",
    "recently , the tools for a next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) renormalization procedure were derived @xcite .",
    "so , there are now all the ingredients necessary to carry out this long standing project .",
    "clearly , the extrapolation is based on the assumption that there is a desert up to the planck scale or , better , that possible new physics do not significantly affect the running of the higgs quartic coupling , which dominates the higgs potential at high energy .    it is interesting that the recently discovered experimental higgs mass range , combined with the experimental top mass range , indicates a particularly intriguing high energy behavior of the higgs potential , close to the transition between electroweak vacuum stability and metastability .",
    "this is due to the fact that , for these higgs and top mass values , the higgs quartic coupling can be very small or even negative . since the dependence on the top mass is strong and quite subtle ,",
    "it is not surprising that different groups slightly disagree in the interpretation of the results , some of them favoring @xcite and some others disfavoring @xcite electroweak vacuum stability .",
    "traditionally the top pole mass was used in the analysis ; however it has been pointed out @xcite that the top pole mass value used in previous analyses and taken to be the one measured at the tevatron , @xmath3 gev @xcite , is not unambiguously derived and that a more careful derivation should be based instead on the running top mass in the @xmath4 scheme , @xmath5 gev . as was shown in @xcite ,",
    "the top pole mass range consistently derived from the running one , @xmath6 gev , is plagued by a larger error than the tevatron measurement considered in @xcite , rescuing electroweak vacuum stability .    in our analysis",
    "we keep as a free parameter the running top mass , rather than the pole one . in this way",
    "we completely avoid the theoretical uncertainties associated with the top yukawa matching procedure .",
    "as we are going to discuss , the theoretical error associated with the higgs quartic coupling matching @xcite turns out to be smaller than the one induced by the experimental uncertainty in the strong gauge coupling , @xmath7 .",
    "given the above mentioned range for the running top mass @xcite , we find that electroweak stability is allowed in the whole higgs mass range @xcite .",
    "stability could soon be excluded if values of the running top mass @xmath8 gev are excluded by the lhc .",
    "otherwise , testing electroweak vacuum stability would become very challenging , since this would require precision measurements of the higgs and top masses , and also of @xmath7 .",
    "a stable higgs potential configuration which deserves particular interest is a shallow false minimum close to the planck scale , which could have been relevant for primordial inflation@xcite .",
    "we show that such a configuration is realized only if the higgs quartic coupling and its derivative satisfy very specific boundary conditions , possibly having a deep origin in quantum gravity .",
    "as is well know , new physics in addition to the sm is required to explain the neutrino masses and mixings , as well as dark matter .",
    "the mechanism responsible for the neutrino masses could affect the higgs quartic coupling ; as an example , we consider the impact that the inclusion of neutrino masses via a type i seesaw has on electroweak stability , discussing in some detail the shallow false minimum configuration .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec-1 ] we discuss the input parameters and the nnlo renormalization procedure used to extrapolate the higgs potential up to the planck scale .",
    "an analysis of electroweak vacuum stability and the associated constraints on the top and higgs masses , with a detailed discussion of the theoretical errors and the prospects for the future , are presented in sec.[sec-2 ] . in sec.[sec-3 ] we investigate the boundary conditions leading to the particularly interesting configuration of a shallow false minimum below the planck scale .",
    "sec.[sec-4 ] is devoted to the upper bound on the seesaw right - handed neutrino masses following from the requirement of electroweak vacuum stability .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sec.[sec - concl ] .",
    "appendix[app - a ] contains the relevant formulas for the nnlo running procedure in the sm and , and those to incorporate the type i seesaw mechanism are found in appendix[app - b ] .",

    "the approximation in eq.([eq - v ] ) holds when considering large field values . according to our normalization",

    "we choose to perform the matching of the higgs quartic coupling @xmath9 at the scale @xmath40 .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty is estimated by performing the matching also at different scales and by evolving @xmath9 via rg running until @xmath40 . the spread in the numerical values obtained for @xmath41 can then be used to infer the magnitude of the theoretical error .",

    "one can see that , working at the 1-loop , the theoretical uncertainty is about @xmath46 .",

    "that , in order to carefully study the shape of the higgs potential at high energy , one should consider the renormalization improved effective potential .",

    "it is well known that the @xmath24-function of the higgs quartic coupling is affected only if @xmath149 , the yukawa coupling of the dirac mass term ( defined only for @xmath150 ) , is large enough . as the top yukawa coupling , also the neutrino yukawa coupling induces a suppression of the higgs quartic coupling at high energy . by increasing @xmath147 and @xmath151 ,",

    "the recent discovery of a particle consistent with the sm higgs boson @xcite provides a strong motivation to pursue @xcite the old project @xcite of investigating the behavior of the sm higgs potential at very high energies .",
    "in particular , one would understand whether the sm electroweak vacuum is a global minimum up to the planck scale , namely whether we live in a stable vacuum assuming a desert ( or assuming that new interactions do not modify the running of @xmath9 with respect to the sm case ) .",
    "in particular , a stable configuration which deserves a special interest is a shallow false minimum below the planck scale : the higgs field could have been primordially trapped there , leading to a stage of inflation@xcite .",
    "stability below the planck scale is required also in higgs inflation models with non minimal gravitational couplings @xcite .    in our analysis , we adopted the recently derived tools for a nnlo renormalization procedure@xcite . at difference of previous analyses , we considered as free parameter the running top mass rather than the ( tevatron ) top pole mass , as suggested in ref.@xcite .",
    "given the present range of the running top mass and of the higgs mass , we found that electroweak vacuum stability is at present allowed , as shown in figs.[fig - line ] and [ fig - resi ] . to further test stability ,",
    "a more precise measurement of the top mass would be crucial . as apparent from the stability condition of eq.([eq - boundmt ] ) , in case that lhc will not exclude values of the running top mass below @xmath162 gev ( or equivalently values of the pole top mass below @xmath163 gev ) , an electron - positron collider would probably be needed to discriminate between stability and metastability .",
