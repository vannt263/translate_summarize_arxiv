    "the origin of mass , or the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) is one of the most urgent problems of the particle physics today .",
    "there are some dynamical approaches toward this problem such as technicolor  @xcite , top - quark condensate  @xcite , etc .",
    "@xcite . in the top - quark condensate or the `` top mode standard model '' ( tmsm ) ,",
    "the scalar bound state of @xmath5 plays the role of the higgs boson in the sm and the top quark naturally acquires the dynamical mass of the order of the ewsb scale .",
    "however , the original version of the tmsm  @xcite has some problems : the 4-fermion interaction of the top - quark was introduced by hand in order to trigger the ewsb .",
    "the top - quark mass @xmath6 was predicted somewhat larger than the experimental value , @xmath7 , even if we take the cutoff to the planck or the gut scale .",
    "@xcite such a huge cutoff also causes a serious fine - tuning problem .",
    "recently , arkani - hamed , cheng , dobrescu , and hall ( acdh )  @xcite proposed an interesting version of tmsm in extra dimensions , where the sm gauge bosons and some generations of quarks and leptons are embedded in @xmath8 dimensions .",
    "since bulk gauge interactions become naively non - perturbative in the high - energy region , the bulk qcd may trigger the top - condensation without introducing ad hoc 4-fermion interactions .",
    "moreover , all condensates of kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes of the top quark contribute to the ewsb , thereby suppressing the predicted value of @xmath6 .    however , we have found that the bulk qcd coupling has an upper bound .",
    "@xcite it is thus nontrivial whether the ewsb dynamically takes place due to the bulk qcd or not .",
    "we thus studied the dynamics of bulk gauge theories , based on the ladder schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equation .",
    "@xcite by this we estimated the critical value of the binding strength @xmath9 , which particularly disfavored the top - quark condensate in the @xmath10 case of the acdh version .",
    "( see sec .  2 .",
    ")    now , in order for the acdh version to work phenomenologically , the top - condensate should be the most attractive channel ( mac )  @xcite and its binding strength @xmath11 at the cutoff @xmath12 should exceed @xmath9 , whereas those of other bound states such as the tau - condensate ( @xmath13 ) should not : @xmath14 comparing our estimations of @xmath9 with the binding strengths obeying the renormalization group equations ( rges ) of the gauge couplings , we determine the cutoff @xmath12 satisfying eq .",
    "( [ top - cond ] ) and thereby predict the top mass as well as the higgs mass .",
    "@xcite in fact we can obtain a certain region of the effective cutoff @xmath12 satisfying eq .",
    "( [ top - cond ] ) for @xmath1 , while the top - condensation is unlikely to occur for @xmath10 .",
    "( see sec .  3 .",
    ") this is in sharp contrast to the earlier approaches of acdh  @xcite and kobakhidze  @xcite where the cutoff @xmath12 is treated as an adjustable parameter .    in sec .  4",
    ", we predict masses of the top quark and the higgs boson in the formulation  la bardeen , hill , and lindner ( bhl )  @xcite based on rges and compositeness conditions .",
    "the value of @xmath6 around the universal compactification scale @xmath15 is governed by the quasi infrared - fixed point ( ir - fp ) for the top - yukawa coupling @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "the behavior of @xmath16 is approximately given by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the conventional qcd coupling .",
    "thus , the prediction of @xmath6 can be suppressed as @xmath22 increases .",
    "we predict numerically the top mass , @xmath23 gev , and the higgs mass , @xmath3 gev , for @xmath1 , where we took @xmath24 tev .",
    "we consider that the sm gauge group and the third generation of quarks and leptons are put in the @xmath8-dimensional bulk , while the first and second generations are confined in 3-brane ( 4-dimensions ) .",
    "we assume that four of @xmath25-dimensions are the usual minkowski spacetime and extra @xmath22 spatial dimensions are compactified at a universal scale @xmath26 .    before analyzing the ladder sd equation",
    ", we study running effects of dimensionless bulk gauge couplings @xmath27 @xmath28 ) . above the compactification scale @xmath15",
    ", we should take into account contributions of kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes .",
    "we find approximately the total number of kk modes @xmath29 below the renormalization point @xmath30 , @xmath31 with the orbifold compactification @xmath32 , where we take @xmath33 and @xmath34 projections for @xmath10 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the dimensionfull bulk gauge coupling @xmath35 is related to the conventional 4-dimensional gauge coupling @xmath36 as @xmath37 . combining the definition of @xmath38 with rges for @xmath39 and eq .",
    "( [ n_kk ] ) , we obtain approximately rges for @xmath27 , @xmath40 with @xmath41^{-1}$ ] .",
    "rge coefficients @xmath42 and @xmath43 are given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 @xmath46 denotes number of generations ( composite higgs bosons ) in the bulk .",
    "hereafter , we assume @xmath47",
    ". we note @xmath48 for @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "we find that the bulk qcd coupling with @xmath48 has the ultraviolet fixed - point ( uv - fp ) @xmath51 , @xmath52 by using eq .",
    "( [ rge_ed3 ] ) .",
    "we can also show that the uv - fp is the upper bound of @xmath53 .",
    "we thus need to investigate whether the bulk qcd coupling can be sufficiently large to trigger the ewsb or not .",
    "let us investigate the condition for the ewsb triggered by the bulk qcd . the @xmath25-dimensional ladder sd equation is given by fig .",
    "[ fig : sd ] : @xmath54 with the mass function @xmath55 and euclidean momenta @xmath56 , where we took the landau gauge in order to make the wave function renormalization identically unity .",
    "@xcite for simplicity , we incorporate running effects of the bulk qcd as @xmath57 , which is closely related to the mac coupling , just on the uv - fp .",
    "this simplification obviously makes the critical point lower .",
    "we then obtain the critical binding strength @xmath9 :",
    "@xmath58 for @xmath10 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "@xcite these are minimal values within uncertainties of the ladder sd equation .",
    "@xcite the critical points are unlikely to be smaller than the above values , even if we take into account the effect that the cutoff @xmath12 is not so large in fact as compared with the compactification scale @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite we use most conservatively the values of eq .",
    "( [ kd_sd1 ] ) in the following analysis .",
    "the upper bounds of the bulk qcd coupling in the acdh scenario are found as @xmath59 for @xmath60 .",
    "@xcite thus , the top - condensation is unlikely to occur for @xmath10 .",
    "we analyze the mac at the cutoff @xmath12 by using rges of bulk gauge couplings . in the one - gauge - boson - exchange approximation",
    ", we can easily obtain @xmath61 : @xmath62 @xmath63 the mac is the top ( tau)-condensate , when the bulk qcd ( hypercharge ) is dominant .",
    "now , we are ready to compare @xmath64 and @xmath65 with the critical values eq .",
    "( [ kd_sd1 ] ) . unless the mac coupling exceeds at least @xmath9 estimated in eq .",
    "( [ kd_sd1 ] ) , any condensates can not be generated in the bulk . when eq .",
    "( [ top - cond ] ) is satisfied , the top - quark acquires the large dynamical mass , whereas the tau - lepton still remains massless .",
    "we show our results in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . actually , eq .  ( [ top - cond ] )",
    "can be satisfied for @xmath1 .",
    "we can confirm that the top - condensation is not favored for @xmath10 .",

    "in the same way as the approach of bhl , we can expect to reproduce the sm in the bulk in the energy scale between @xmath15 and @xmath12 : @xmath67 with @xmath68 and the kinetic term @xmath69 for the top quark and gauge bosons .",
