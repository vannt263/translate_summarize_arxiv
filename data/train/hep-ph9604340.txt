    "the problem of decay of homogeneous oscillations of the inflaton field after inflation is one of the most important issues of inflationary cosmology .",
    "this process is responsible for the reheating of the universe , in particular , the reheating temperature depends on the details of the decay of homogeneous oscillations .",
    "recently , this problem has attracted considerable interest , and new investigations have revealed a rather complicated dynamics of the inflaton field . in the old approach , which is called `` elementary theory '' @xcite ,",
    "the decay of the spatially homogeneous oscillations of the inflaton field is described by a friction term in the equation of motion , which has a coefficient proportional to the decay rate of the inflaton quanta .",
    "this picture leads to a slow , exponential decay of the amplitude of oscillations .",
    "it is not until recently that it has been discovered that in most important cases this picture is not correct .",
    "the reason for that is usually related to the existence of the resonance bands in the spectrum of the scalars interacting with the inflaton field , which contains modes that are unstable on the background of homogeneous oscillations of inflaton field . the importance of parametric resonance was first realized by kofman , linde and starobinsky @xcite .",
    "the modes affected by this phenomenon may be of the inflaton field itself or belongs to any scalar coupled to the inflaton .",
    "as the importance of the parametric resonance has been understood , a new scenario has be proposed @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . according to the latter ,",
    "the reheating process occurs in two steps . at the first step ,",
    "dubbed `` preheating '' , the amplitudes of the quantum modes inside the resonance bands increase exponentially , giving rise at some time moment to the creation of a large number of quanta of inflaton or other scalar fields . due to the exponential character of the growth of the resonance modes ,",
    "the creation of the particles by parametric resonance is an explosion  type process , where most particles are emitted at the very last moments of the preheating epoch .",
    "after this explosion , most energy is carried by the created particles , and the old theory of reheating can be applied to the thermalization of the products of explosion and to the decay of the remnant of the homogeneous oscillations .    despite the fact that there is a growing number of works aimed at extracting physical consequences from the scenario advocated in ref.@xcite ( see refs.@xcite ) , the latter deserves more detail theoretical elaboration in order to take into account important physical effects that may change many details of the evolution of the universe after the explosion . let us mention only two of these effects .",
    "the first is the phase coherence between the modes created by parametric resonance : the wave functions of particles created in this way have almost the same phase , which is correlated with the phase of the homogeneous oscillations .",
    "this phase correlation , presumably , may have certain consequences , in the same manner as the coherent nature of the homogeneous oscillations lead to the parametric resonance .",
    "the second important effect is the scattering between the particles , which can not be neglected even in theories with small coupling .",
    "in fact , according to the standard picture , the particles created by preheating have very large occupation numbers , typically of the order of the inversed coupling .",
    "these large occupation numbers lead to strong bose enhancement of the scattering processes , and the system is effectively strongly coupled .",
    "this implies , in particular , that after the explosion , the relaxation time is of the same order as the period of oscillation , and the effect of particle collision can not be neglected .",
    "existing calculations @xcite mostly rely on the hartree  fock approximations , where the effect of particle collision is not taken into account .",
    "closely related to the decay of homogeneous oscillation is the thermalization among products of parametric resonance particle production .",
    "it has been argued that since the particles produced by parametric resonance has energy much smaller than the equilibrium temperature , the thermalization takes a long time interval as the particles have to go through may collisions in order to overcome the wide separation of energy scales .",
    "however , no theory of thermalization has been developed , as well as no reliable estimation of the thermalization time has been made so far .    that the universe after the preheating explosion is effectively strongly  coupled as mentioned above makes the study of the dynamics of the universe quite difficult , and it has been suggested that numerical methods may be used to simulate processes occurring after inflation @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of this type has been carried out for the simplest @xmath0 theory in ref.@xcite , but in order to understand the qualitative features in the evolution of the universe after inflation , as well as to check the validity of the hartree ",
    "fock approximation , it is desirable to have a simple model where this evolution can be followed in the whole time interval from the beginning up to the thermalization in a reliable way .    in this paper",
    "we consider one of such models .",
    "we neglect the expansion of the universe , and consider the theory of one self  coupled scalar filed without symmetry breaking .",
    "the initial amplitude of the homogeneous oscillations is taken to be small enough for the latter to be almost sinusoidal .",
    "more precisely , the amplitude is supposed to be @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the boson mass and @xmath3 is the coupling , and @xmath4 is some small dimensionless parameter , @xmath5 . despite the fact that the effect of parametric resonance is suppressed by a power of @xmath4 , we will show that the analogue of the elementary theory of reheating is totally inapplicable when @xmath6 . in particular , this theory is invalid in the regime that we consider throughout the paper , where @xmath4 is small , but fixed , and @xmath7 . by considering the regime where the elementary theory breaks down , we let our model possess the main feature of the theories where parametric resonance is important . that the evolution of the universe can be found reliably in our regime",
    "is the consequence of the existence of an additional small parameter @xmath4 in our model .",
    "let us briefly outline our results .",
    "at first , when the field makes homogeneous oscillations , the modes inside the resonance bands are enhanced and their amplitudes increase exponentially with time .",
    "the modes that are enhanced most are those around the center of the resonance band near @xmath8 . at some time moment ,",
    "when the energy carried by the resonance modes is still small , the back - reaction of these modes to the homogeneous background and their self  interaction become important and the exponential growth of the modes terminates .",
    "the dynamics of the field becomes rather complicated , but during some time interval it can be treated by the hartree ",
    "fock approximation .",
    "we see that the coherent nature of the modes created by parametric resonance leads to a period of time where some portion of the energy is transfered back and forth between the homogeneous oscillations and the resonance modes .",
    "therefore , the decay rate is reduced by the coherence effect . after some time interval the coherence is destroyed , and the system goes to another regime where created modes are uncorrelated . in this regime , there is still coherent enhancement of modes by parametric resonance , but now the width of the resonance band is much smaller than that of the particle spectrum .",
    "moreover , the resonance band moves towards the region of smaller energies , so each mode with a given momentum is enhanced during only a finite time interval , after than they become uncorrelated and can be considered as ordinary particles . by this mechanism ,",
    "the long  run effect of parametric resonance is non  explosive production of particles with energy approximately @xmath8 .",
    "the rate of particle production slowly changes with time , but not by many orders of magnitude .",
    "after a period of particle emission , when most energy is still carried by the homogeneous mode , the density of created particles is already enough for the non  coherent scattering between the particles becomes important and the hartree ",
    "fock approximation breaks down . to describe the system in this regime ,",
    "we make use of the boltzmann kinetic equation .",
    "we find that the production of particles via parametric resonance occurs concurrently with their dissipation to other modes by scattering , which leads to the excitation of modes with larger and larger energies .",
    "it is very interesting that the dynamics of the scalar field is similar to that of turbulent systems , where energy is transfered from long  distance to short  distance modes . in particular ,",
    "the kolmogorov power spectrum is formed after some time interval among the particles with nonzero momenta .    during the whole period",
    "describe above , the amplitude of homogeneous oscillations gradually decreases .",
    "when the energy carried by the homogeneous mode becomes much smaller than the total energy , the thermalization epoch begins .",
    "the thermalization can be divided into two steps where the distribution function shows two different self ",
    "similar behaviors , depending on whether the bose condensation is effective compared to condensate evaporation .",
    "let us only note that the typical energy of particles increases continuously , while the typical occupation number decreases .",
    "the time required to achieve thermal equilibrium is estimated to be @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , the results of our paper show that the dynamics of the scalar field after the explosion is much more complicated than predicted by the hartree  fock approximation , and there is interplay between various processes , including particle creation , scattering , and bose condensation , which must be accurately taken into account in order to find out the actual behavior of the system . generally , we find that the scattering slows down the decay of the homogeneous oscillations .",
    "our investigation suggests that features discovered in our model may be common in some realistic theories .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect.2",
    "we describe the model , and show that the elementary theory of reheating is not valid in a particular regime in this model .",
    "we consider the parametric resonance , in particular the strongest resonance band that is located at energies closed to @xmath8 .",
    "we show that the linear regime , where back - reaction of the created particle to the background can be neglected , breaks down when the energy carried by produced particles is still small .",
    "sect.3 is devoted to the hartree ",
    "fock approximation , where particles are considered as moving on a self  consistent background .",
    "we derived the hartree ",
    "fock equation for the amplitude of the wave functions of the particles , and show that the phase coherence of the latter slow down the decay of the homogeneous oscillations .",
    "we find analytically the rate of particle creation in the long run . in sect.4",
    "we take into account the scattering among produced particles and describe the evolution of the system in the regime where both particle creation and scattering occurs at the same speed .",
    "we show that the part of our system that contains particles with nonzero momenta behaves like a typical turbulent system . in particular ,",
    "we find the kolmogorov index of turbulence for our case .",
    "in sect.5 we discuss the behavior of the system after the amplitude of homogeneous oscillations become small is considered .",
    "the thermalization is described , and the time required for it is also estimated .",
    "finally , sect.6 contains concluding remarks .",
    "let us consider the theory of one scalar field in flat minkowskian space ",
    "time , @xmath10 where the coupling constant @xmath3 is assumed to be small , @xmath11 . for convenience",
    "we take the mass of the boson to be 1 .",
    "we suppose that at the beginning the field @xmath12 makes spatially homogeneous oscillations .",
    "this can be done by adding a source term @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a constant at @xmath15 , to the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) and turn off @xmath14 at @xmath16 .",
    "we assume that the amplitude of the oscillation is much smaller than @xmath17 , so that it is almost sinusoidal . to the leading approximation ,",
    "the time dependence @xmath12 is of the form @xmath18 where @xmath5",
    ". we will be interested in the process of energy transfer from the homogeneous mode to the modes with nonzero momentum .",
    "the regime that we are interested in is small , but fixed , @xmath4 , and @xmath7 .",
    "let us first show that in this regime , the elementary theory of reheating is not applicable .",
    "the homogeneous oscillation ( [ cos ] ) can be considered as a condensate of particles with zero momentum .",
    "the particle density in the condensate that corresponds to the oscillations ( [ cos ] ) is @xmath19 in the elementary theory of reheating , the decay of the homogeneous mode ( which will also be called `` condensate evaporation '' ) is viewed as a perturbative process which usually occurs via the decay of inflaton quanta in the condensate to other particles . in our case where the theory contains only one scalar , the @xmath12quanta are stable , but there are still processes that creates @xmath12quanta with nonzero momentum from those in condensate .",
    "the first perturbative process of this type is the @xmath20 process , in which 4 @xmath12bosons at rest become to 2 particles with energy @xmath21 each .",
    "the amplitude of this @xmath20 process is not vanishing and proportional to @xmath22 .",
    "the rate of the @xmath20 can be obtained by multiplying the squared amplitude to the fourth power of @xmath23 ( since it involves 4 initial particles ) , and the elementary theory in our case predicts @xmath24 the time scale of the decay of the condensate is @xmath25 however this naive calculation is incorrect . though usually the breakdown of the elementary theory is related to the phenomenon of parametric resonance , it can be easily understood also in the perturbative framework . to do that , let us recall that in our calculations we assume implicitly that the two final particles of the @xmath20 process are emitted as in vacuum .",
    "however , the rate of this process is enhanced if there are already particles with energy @xmath21 .",
    "in fact , provided the occupation number at the energy level @xmath21 is @xmath26 , then the @xmath20 probability is enhanced by the bose factor of @xmath27 .",
    "there is also the time ",
    "reversal transition where two particles with energy @xmath21 go back to 4 particles at rest , which has a relative rate of @xmath28 .",
    "if one combines the two processes one finds that the overall rate of transition from the condensate is @xmath29 times larger than predicted by the elementary theory , which implies that the latter is correct only when the occupation number @xmath26 is much smaller than 1 .",
    "let us estimate the occupation number at the energy level @xmath21 . at the beginning",
    "this occupation number is 0 , but it increases due to the radiation by @xmath20 transitions . the particles with energy @xmath21 would be accumulated in large number if they remain untouched at the same energy level after they have been created , however in reality these particles scatter on those in the condensate and have a finite mean free time of order @xmath30 ( where @xmath31 is the typical cross section in particle collisions , @xmath32 ) . note that at the values of @xmath4 we are considering , @xmath5 , the mean free time @xmath33 is much smaller than the time scale in eq.([naive_timescale ] ) .",
    "each particle created from the condensate lives at the energy level @xmath21 for a time interval @xmath33 , therefore the maximal density of particles with energy @xmath21 that can be achieved is @xmath34 though this density is much smaller than @xmath23 , the occupation number would be infinite if all these particles have exactly the same energy .",
    "however , due to the heisenberg principle , the energy of particles has an uncertainty of order @xmath35 since they have a finite lifetime .",
    "the particle distribution in the momentum space , so , can be imagined as a spherical shell around @xmath21 with the thickness of @xmath35 .",
    "the occupation number can be found by dividing the particle density ( [ density ] ) to the phase space that the particles occupy , @xmath36 recall that the condition for the elementary theory of reheating to be valid is @xmath37 , one finds that the latter can be applied only when @xmath38 , or , in other words , the amplitude of the homogeneous oscillations must be much smaller than 1 .",
    "since in the regime considered in this paper ( @xmath39 , @xmath7 ) this condition is violated , the elementary theory is not appropriate for our purposes .",
    "since the elementary theory of reheating breaks down , let us turn to the parametric resonance .",
    "for further calculations , we need a more accurate expression for the solution to the field equation than eq.([cos ] ) . at small",
    "@xmath4 , the following formula for the solution can be derived , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the frequency of the oscillations . as noted above ,",
    "the oscillations is almost a cosine : the higher harmonics come with smaller coefficients than the leading one .",
    "if the system under consideration is classical , and the spatial homogeneity is exact , the oscillations ( [ sol ] ) would continue infinitely long",
    ". however , this is not true in the quantum case .",
    "the reason for the behavior of the quantum system to be different is that the homogeneous oscillation ( [ sol ] ) is unstable : some vacuum quantum fluctuations become larger with time . to see this instability",
    "let us quantize the scalar field on the background ( [ sol ] ) .",
    "for this end we decompose the file operator into classical and quantum parts , @xmath42 .",
    "the part of the lagrangian that is quadratic on @xmath43 has the form , @xmath44={1\\over2}(\\partial_\\mu\\tilde{\\phi})^2-    { 1\\over2}\\left(1+{\\lambda\\over2}\\phi_0 ^ 2(t)\\right)\\tilde{\\phi}^2    \\label{l2}\\ ] ] the quantization is completely analogous to that of the free scalar field on the vacuum background .",
    "as the result , one represents @xmath43 via the creation and annihilation operators @xmath45 where @xmath46=(2\\pi)^32\\omega_k\\delta({\\bf k}-{\\bf k}')$ ] . if there is no homogeneous oscillations , one has @xmath47 , where @xmath48 , and eq.([quantiz ] ) reduces to the usual formula for quantized scalar field on the vacuum background . on the background of @xmath49",
    ", @xmath50 is a solution to the mode equation @xmath51 to find the initial condition for eq.([mode_eq ] ) , let us note that at @xmath15 the source term @xmath13 is present in the lagrangian , so @xmath49 is constant , and the lagrangian ( [ l2 ] ) is just that of a scalar field on the vacuum background . neglecting the small correction to the mass , one has @xmath52 we will call @xmath50 the wave function of particles with momentum @xmath53 ( in fact it gives the time dependent of the wave function ) .",
    "eq.([mode_eq ] ) has the same form as the equation of motion of an oscillator whose frequency is a periodic function of time , @xmath54 .",
    "such systems are well known in classical mechanics to exhibits the phenomenon of parametric resonance , which means that there are values of @xmath55 where any solution to @xmath50 to eq.([fekt ] ) becomes arbitrarily large in at least one of the limits @xmath56 or @xmath57 @xcite . in the case when the dependence of the frequency on time is weak , as in our problem ( @xmath5 ) , the solution to eq.([mode_eq ] ) can be found analytically , and the parametric resonance occurs when @xmath58 is close to 1 , 2 , 3 , etc .",
    "( the higher @xmath58 , the weaker is the parametric resonance ) . to demonstrate the technique which will be extensively explored in this paper ,",
    "let us discuss the first resonance near @xmath59 .",
    "let us follow the technique of @xcite and find out the first resonance band near @xmath59 , where the parametric resonance is strongest .",
    "the result in this subsection will not be used in other part of the papers , sine the resonance band lies in the region of unphysical values of @xmath58 .",
    "however , the techniques used here to find the first resonance band can be applied , with minor modifications , to the second resonance and the hartree ",
    "fock approximation , so they are worth detail consideration .",
    "first , let us substitute eq.([sol ] ) to eq.([mode_eq ] ) .",
    "for our purpose , only the leading term in eq.([sol ] ) is important .",
    "one obtains , @xmath60 the idea is to find @xmath50 in the form of a function with oscillatory behavior with the same frequency @xmath61 as @xmath49 , but the amplitude of the oscillations is supposed to be a slowly varying function of time .",
    "so we look for the solution in the form @xmath62 where @xmath63 varies in a time scale much larger than 1 , and dots stay for terms of higher harmonics . substituting eq.([1res_sol ] ) to eq.([1res ] ) , and neglecting terms with second derivatives of @xmath64 and @xmath65 with time , as well as those with higher harmonics , we obtain @xmath66 since @xmath67 and @xmath68 vary much slower than @xmath69 and @xmath70 , eq.([ikt - ikt ] ) can be satisfied only if both the coefficients of @xmath69 and @xmath70 vanish .",
    "thus , one obtains the following equations , @xmath71 @xmath72 the solution to this set of equation can be searched in the form @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "one finds @xmath75 note that if one considers only the values of @xmath58 so that @xmath76 , then @xmath77 , and our assumption that @xmath67 varies on a time scale much larger than 1 is justified ( in our case this time scale is @xmath78 ) .",
    "depending on whether @xmath79 is larger or smaller than @xmath80 , @xmath81 is purely imaginary or real .",
    "if @xmath81 is purely imaginary , the solutions can not be arbitrary large .",
    "the parametric resonance occurs only when @xmath81 is real , for example , the solution corresponding to positive @xmath81 can be arbitrary large if @xmath82 is large enough . from eq.([sk1 ] ) one finds that the parametric resonance occurs when @xmath58 lies in a finite window , @xmath83 however , it is easy to note that since @xmath84 , the upper limit of the range ( [ range ] ) coincides with 1 .",
    "so , eq.([range ] ) corresponds to unphysical values of @xmath58 , @xmath85 , and there is no parametric resonance at physical @xmath58 .",
    "so far , our calculations are performed only to the first order on @xmath86 and do not exclude the possibility that the upper limit of the resonance band is differ from 1 by a value of @xmath87 , so there is still a very small region of physical @xmath58 where there is parametric resonance .",
    "however , the coincidence of the upper limit of the band and the boson mass can be shown to be hold exactly , to any order of @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , at @xmath88 , the mode equation ( [ mode_eq ] ) possesses a solution @xmath89 that is a periodic function of @xmath82 with the same period as @xmath49 .",
    "this fact shows that at @xmath90 one has @xmath91 exactly .",
    "let us turn to the second resonance at @xmath92 .",
    "now one must take into account the second term in the expansion ( [ sol ] ) and the linearized equation for @xmath50 is @xmath93 in analogy with the case of first resonance band , we will seek the solution to eq.([2nd_res ] ) in the form @xmath94 where we assume that @xmath67 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 are slowly varying functions that vary in a typical time scale of @xmath97 .",
    "we also expect that the coefficients of non  leading harmonics , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , are suppressed by a factor of @xmath86 as compared to the leading harmonics , @xmath67 . substituting the ansatz ( [ 2nd_ansatz ] ) to eq.([2nd_res ] ) and set the coefficients of @xmath98 , @xmath99 and 1 to zero ,",
    "one obtains the following equations , respectively , @xmath100",
    "@xmath101 @xmath102 from the last two equations one finds @xmath103 , @xmath104 .",
    "the first equation now can be written as @xmath105 where @xmath106 .",
    "this equation , except from the difference in numerical coefficients , has the same form as that of the first resonance ( eq.([1_res ] ) . as is this case , there are two solutions proportional to @xmath107 where @xmath108 the resonance band is then @xmath109 since @xmath110 is approximately @xmath111 , the entire resonance band lies entirely in the physical region .",
    "some remarks are in order :    \\1 .",
    "the center of the resonance band is located at @xmath112 , i.e. is displaced by @xmath113 from 2 .",
    "the width of the resonance band is of order @xmath114 , and is much smaller than the distance from the center of the resonance band to 2 .",
    "the rate of exponential enhancement @xmath81 is also of order @xmath114",
    ".    there may be resonance bands at higher @xmath58 , however we will ignore them since they are weaker than the one at @xmath92 .",
    "now let us consider the behavior of the vacuum fluctuation on the background @xmath49 . at @xmath16 ,",
    "the functions @xmath50 are of order 1 for any value of @xmath55 . as @xmath82 increases",
    ", the modes inside the resonance bands become large , while those lying outside the bands remain small . the most important",
    "are the modes in the strongest physical band , i.e. the second one , which grows as @xmath107 where @xmath81 is the positive value defined from eq.([sk ] ) . if @xmath115 only the modes close to the center of the band are important . from eq.([sk ] ) one finds for these modes @xmath116 and since the energy carried by the modes with momentum @xmath53 is proportional to @xmath117 , the energy distribution has the gaussian form centering at @xmath118 and with width of order @xmath119 .",
    "we will call the regime when eq.([gaussian ] ) is valid the linear regime , since the modes obey the linearized equation on the background @xmath49 .",
    "now let us find out the region of validity of this regime .",
    "one may expect that the linear regime is valid once the energy of the inhomogeneous modes is much smaller than that of the homogeneous one .",
    "however in fact the linear regime breaks down when the energy carried by the inhomogeneous modes is still much smaller than the total energy .",
    "the reason for this is that the resonance band in our case has a small width proportional to @xmath114 , and a small change of the amplitude of homogeneous oscillations can drive the resonance band to a new location that does not overlap with the original resonance band .",
    "let us estimate the upper limit on the energy carried by non ",
    "homogeneous modes for the linear approximation to be valid . due to the energy conservation , when a portion of energy is transfered to non  homogeneous modes , the amplitude of the homogeneous oscillation decreases , and let us denote this as @xmath120 .",
    "the center of the resonance band is located at @xmath121 , and we required that this values is shifted by a value much smaller than the width of the resonance band .",
    "this leads to the condition @xmath122 since @xmath123 is proportional to the fraction of energy carried by inhomogeneous modes , the latter must be smaller than @xmath86 of the total , for the linear regime to be valid , @xmath124 taking into account eq.([gaussian ] ) , one finds that the linear regime breaks down at @xmath125 after @xmath126 , the back  reaction of the created modes onto the homogeneous oscillations can not be neglected .",
    "note that at @xmath127 , the width of the gaussian distribution , eq.([gaussian ] ) , is @xmath128 , i.e. much smaller than that of the resonance band .    before turning to hartree ",
    "fock approximation to go further than the linear regime , let us make an important remark on the phase coherence of the wave functions @xmath50 of particles created during the linear regime .",
    "this coherence can be seen in the simple case of @xmath129 . in this case @xmath130 , and from eq.([4i ] ) one sees that the exponentially increasing solution corresponds to @xmath67 having the phase @xmath131 , i.e. @xmath132 where @xmath133 is a real constant . from eq.([2nd_ansatz ] ) one finds , @xmath134 thus , except from the slowly varying exponential part , the wave function @xmath50 has a well  defined phase shift , namely @xmath131 , with @xmath135 .",
    "it is worth noting that this phase shift is the same for all vectors @xmath53 pointing to all possible directions that have @xmath118 .",
    "if one does not require that @xmath118 , , the phase shift is different , but since most excited particles lies in a narrow central part of the resonance band , this phase shift is approximately constant for all modes excited during the linear regime .",
    "in the previous section we have seen that the linear regime is violated rather early when the energy transfered to the inhomogeneous modes is still small . after the linear regime ceases to be valid",
    ", one must take into account back - reaction of the inhomogeneous modes to the homogeneous oscillations , in particular the decrease of the amplitude of the latter due to the energy lost , and also the interaction between the modes . in this section",
    ", we will apply the hartree ",
    "fock approximation to this problem ( the hartree ",
    "fock approximation was discussed earlier in connection with the problem of reheating in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the region when this approximation is justified will be discussed as well .",
    "the hartree ",
    "fock equations has the form , @xmath136 @xmath137 where @xmath49 and @xmath43 are the classical and quantum parts of @xmath12 , respectively . recalling eq.([quantiz ] ) , the mean value of @xmath138 is @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the mode function that is still to be found . it is convenient to decompose @xmath140 into real and imaginary parts , @xmath141 where @xmath142 and @xmath143 are both real .",

    "we will consider the behavior of the system after the moment @xmath293 up to the time when the the homogeneous mode begins to lost a considerable portion of its energy . since the energy flux from the homogeneous mode is @xmath274 and",
    "the total energy is of order @xmath296 , the latter time moment is @xmath297 .",
    "thus , in this section we consider @xmath298 .",
    "the system can be characterized by the distribution function @xmath299 , while the homogeneous oscillations correspond to the delta  functional part of @xmath281 at @xmath300 .",
    "let us first write down the generic boltzmann equation ( the boltzmann equation for the @xmath0 field theory has been studied in a different setting , see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "since most of our discussion will be based on order  of  magnitude estimations , we will neglect all numerical factors .",
    "one writes , @xmath301 @xmath302 in fact , one should take into account the particle creation by parametric resonance , however let us first neglects this effect .",
    "since the occupation numbers are typically of order @xmath275 which are much larger than 1 , one can neglect the terms 1 compared to @xmath26 .",
    "the boltzmann equation now becomes @xmath303 @xmath304 let us make two remarks on eq.([nnn ] ) .",
    "first , since we have @xmath305 , the time scale set by the boltzmann equation does not depend parametrically on @xmath3 ( but may depend on @xmath4 ) .",
    "second , if at some @xmath82 the mode @xmath53 is unoccupied , @xmath306 , the particles will be created at this @xmath53 only when there is a process @xmath307 where the other three momenta participating in the process have nonzero occupation numbers .",
    "since the initial condition for the boltzmann equation is that where all particles have energy @xmath308 or 2 , approximately , one can expect that the particle distribution will have peaks at @xmath288 , 4 ... i.e. at integer values of @xmath309 when @xmath293 .",
    "in fact , if three particles participating in a scattering have integer energies , the energy of the fourth is also integer due to energy conservation .",
    "this `` peak  like '' structure of the spectrum will not preserve infinitely long : since the particles produced by parametric resonance have not exactly the same energy , the width of the peaks will become broader and broader , and at some time moment comparable to 1 , however this happens at some time scale much larger than @xmath310 .",
    "therefore , we take the distribution function in the form @xmath311 where we have introduced the notation @xmath312 , which is the momentum corresponding to the energy @xmath313 .",
    "note that @xmath314 has the meaning of the density of particles with energy @xmath315 . before substituting eq.([boltz_ansatz ] ) to eq.([nnn ] ) , let us also notice that the scattering processes @xmath316 ( where @xmath317 ) can be divided into 2 types : those without participation of condensate particles ( i.e. all @xmath318 are nonzero ) , and those with one condensate particle participating in the scattering ( one of @xmath319 is 0 ) . in order to avoid the overlap with the hartree ",
    "fock effects , it is necessary to exclude from consideration the scattering where two of the participating particles have zero momenta .",
    "it is natural to expect that when the density of non  condensate particles is still small , the processes of the second type ( which will be called `` three  particle '' processes ) dominate over those of the first type ( `` four  particle '' transitions ) .",
    "the criterion for the 4particle scattering to be negligible compared to the 3particles ones can be easily found .",
    "in fact , the 3particle processes are enhanced by the bose factor of @xmath23 due to the participation of a condensate particle in the scattering , while the 4particle processes contain instead of this factor an additional momentum integral @xmath320 .",
    "so , the criterion for the 4particle collision to be negligible is @xmath321 running ahead , let us state that this condition is satisfied in the whole evolution up to the moment when thermalization is completed .    at first , one can consider the density of particles in the condensate @xmath23 as a constant . substituting eq.([boltz_ansatz ] ) to the boltzmann equation , and throwing away terms corresponding to four  particle collisions , after some calculations ( see appendix b ) the following equation is obtained , @xmath322 where we have included into the r.h.s .",
    "the term @xmath323 to take into account the production of particles with energy closed to @xmath21 that we have found in the hartree ",
    "fock approximation .",
    "therefore , the boltzmann equation is now written in terms of a discrete set of numbers @xmath314 which is proportional to the density of particles with energy closed to @xmath315 .",
    "let us emphasize that in eq.([nn ] ) we do not write down the numerical constants . for estimation , it is sufficient to take a constant @xmath324 , although in fact we found in sect.3 that the production rate is slowly changing .    as seen from eq.([nn ] ) , due to the scattering , particles with energy @xmath288 are created by colliding two particles with energy @xmath21",
    ". then particles with energy @xmath325 and 5 come to existence in the collision of particles with energy @xmath21 and 3 , etc .",
    "therefore , particles with higher and higher energies are created , despite the fact that the source term in eq.([nn ] ) produces particles with @xmath21 only .",
    "the situation when energy is transfered from the long  distance modes to short  distance ones is the common situation in turbulent systems ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "hence one can make use of the vast intuition elaborated in the theory of turbulence in order to predict the long  term behavior of the system described by eq.([nn ] ) .",
    "in particular , in the turbulent systems , if one has a constant flow of energy into the modes at some momentum scale during an infinite time interval , a stationary distribution is formed . to find this distribution in our case , one looks for those which has vanishing collision integral , @xmath326 while eq.([stationary ] ) seems hard to solve analytically , the asymptotics of @xmath314 at large @xmath315 can be found . in analogy with the kolmogorov spectrum of turbulence , the stationary solution can be expected to have the form @xmath327 at large @xmath315 . for convenience ,",
    "it is useful to introduce @xmath328 which ( at large @xmath309 ) has the meaning of the average occupation number @xmath281 at energy @xmath329 ( one can imagine @xmath330 as the distribution function after one smears off the peaks of the spectrum ) . at large @xmath315 , the sums in eq.([nn ] ) can be transformed to integrals , and one obtains , @xmath331 @xmath332 substituting the ansatz @xmath333 to this equation , one obtains the following equation on the kolmogorov index @xmath334 for @xmath330 to be stationary , @xmath335 the l.h.s .  is finite when @xmath334 lies in the region @xmath336 .",
    "it can be verified that eq.([alpha_eq ] ) has exactly two solutions , @xmath337 and @xmath338 ( accidentally , these values coincide with the kolmogorov indices in the case of non  relativistic bose gas with condensate , see ref.@xcite ) .",

    "the second solution is a non ",
    "trivial one , @xmath340 , and describes the particle distribution developed in our system after an infinite time interval .",
    "in fact , this stationary spectrum can be established only if one have the energy flux to the mode with @xmath21 during an infinitely long time period ( this can be seen from the fact that the stationary spectrum @xmath341 has infinite energy ) . in the real situation when this time interval is finite , one expects that the kolmogorov spectrum is cut off in the ultraviolet .",
    "in other words , at finite @xmath82 one has @xmath341 at @xmath342 and @xmath343 at @xmath344 .",
    "the cutoff @xmath345 is expected to increase with @xmath82 . note that for this type of spectrum both energy and particle number is concentrated at the cutoff , @xmath346 .    that the kolmogorov index is equal @xmath347 can be understood in a very intuitive way .",

    "the time scale during which the cutoff is , say , doubled , is of the same order as the time scale set by the boltzmann equation , which can be estimated to be proportional to @xmath350 . during this time interval",
    ", an amount of energy , also proportional to @xmath351 is fed into the system , which is spent to the creation of particles with energies between @xmath345 and @xmath352 .",
    "the total energy of these particles is @xmath353 .",
    "so , we obtain the equation @xmath354 , which gives the kolmogorov index @xmath338 .    the power law @xmath341 is valid only at @xmath355 .",
    "let us consider the particle spectrum at the momentum scale of the cutoff , @xmath346 . in analogy with the situation in turbulence systems @xcite",
    ", one can expect that the distribution has the following self  similar behavior , @xmath356 where @xmath357 and @xmath358 are some constants chosen so that the function @xmath359 varies on the typical values of @xmath360 of order 1 and is itself of order 1 .",
    "we will try to find @xmath361 and @xmath362 but will not attempt to obtain the form of the function @xmath359 .",
    "substituting this ansatz to the boltzmann equation , and comparing the time dependence of the left and right hand sides , one finds that the latter can be satisfied only if the following relation between @xmath361 and @xmath362 holds , @xmath363 on the other hand , one expects that when @xmath349 eq.([self_sim ] ) must reproduce the kolmogorov distribution .",
    "this fact implies that the asymptotics of the function @xmath359 at small @xmath360 is @xmath364 .",
    "furthermore , in the same region @xmath349 , the spectrum must be stationary , i.e. @xmath281 does not depend on @xmath82 .",
    "taking into account these two facts , one obtains one more equation on @xmath361 and @xmath362 , @xmath365 solving eqs.([p+q=1 ] ) and ( [ 3p/2=q ] ) , we find @xmath366 , @xmath367 .",
    "in particular the cutoff @xmath345 grows with time as @xmath368 .",
    "the total energy of the system behaves like @xmath369 , which agrees with the fact that the energy is fed into the system with a constant rate .",
    "since the rate of creation of particles with energy close to 2 is @xmath274 , one obtains @xmath370 . on the other hand , at @xmath293 ,",
    "the typical momentum of particles is 1 , so @xmath371 .",
    "therefore , @xmath372 , and eq.([self_sim ] ) looks like the following , @xmath373    let us emphasize that in our calculations are limited to the range @xmath298 .",
    "it is straightforward to verify the condition for the 4particle collisions to be negligible : the l.h.s.of eq.([4part ] ) is of order @xmath296 while the r.h.s .",
    "is always smaller than @xmath374 in the time interval we are considering , @xmath298 .",
    "another note is in order .",
    "the total kinetic energy of the produced particles grow almost linearly with time , but since the average energy of the particles also grows as @xmath375 , the number of particles grows only as @xmath376 .",
    "this means that the larger is @xmath82 , the slower is the growth of the total number of particles outside the condensate .",
    "this slowdown occurs despite the fact that particles with energy @xmath21 are produced with approximately constant rate .",
    "there is in fact no contradiction since the dominant collision process in our case is the @xmath377 scattering where two particles with nonzero momenta collide and become one particles in the condensate and one particle with nonzero momentum : each such act effectively reduces the number of particles with nonzero momentum by 1 . at large @xmath82",
    "most particles produced at the energy level 2 effectively go back to the condensate by this mechanism , transferring their kinetic energy to the particles that are already outside the condensate .",
    "the condensate looses 4 particles in each @xmath20 transition but gains back 2 particles from the scattering , therefore the actual rate of condensate evaporation is smaller than predicted by the hartree ",
    "fock approximation by a factor of 2 .    for further reference let us note that at the end of the epoch that we are considering , @xmath378 , the typical momentum of particles is @xmath379 and the typical occupation number is @xmath380 .",
    "since now the typical energy is much larger than 1 , one can neglect the peak structure of the spectrum and deal with the average occupation number @xmath330 only , regardless how effective the processes broadening the peaks are .",
    "when @xmath82 become much larger than @xmath297 , the energy carried by the condensate becomes much smaller than the total .",
    "therefore , one can consider the regime @xmath382 as the epoch of thermalization of particles produced by condensate evaporation .",
    "though the condensate now carries only a small fraction of the energy , it still plays an important role in the scattering process .",
    "in fact , we will find that the 3particle collisions are still dominant .",
    "let us first find out the time dependence of the condensate density . to do that let us first assume that the the dominant mechanism of the decay of the condensate density is the coherent particle creation via parametric resonance .",

    "@xmath358 one makes use of the matching condition with the previous regime at @xmath378 where we have found @xmath392 and @xmath393 .",

    "the first is that particles in the condensates are lost mainly due to the parametric resonance condensate evaporation . to find when this assumption is justified ,",
    "let us mention that the concurrent process that changes the density of the condensate is the particle collision : as noted above , the dominant scattering is supposed to be those where 2 non  condensate particles collide and becomes one non ",
    "condensate particle and a condensate one and the number of particle in the condensate is increased by 1 .",
    "therefore , there is a flux of particles coming from the non ",
    "condensate modes back to the condensate , which can be calculated by taking the time derivative of the total number of non  condensate particles",
    ". we will refer to this phenomenon as `` bose condensation '' ( cf .",
    "refs.@xcite ) .    according to eq.([2/15 ] ) , the total number of particles with nonzero momentum is @xmath397 , so the flux of particles to the condensate is @xmath398 . on the other hand ,",
    "the rate of particle creation by parametric resonance is @xmath399 . comparing the two quantities",
    ", one sees that the former process can be neglected when @xmath400 .",
    "the bose condensation becomes comparable to condensate evaporation at @xmath401 .",
    "so , the region of validity of eq.([2/15 ] ) is @xmath381 .",
    "another requirement that must be verified is eq.([4part ] ) .",
    "the l.h.s .",
    "is @xmath402 while the r.h.s .",
    "is of order @xmath403 .",
    "it is easy to see that the l.h.s .   is larger than the r.h.s .  everywhere in the region @xmath381 .",
    "according to eq.([2/15 ] ) , at the end of the regime , @xmath404 , the typical energy of particles is @xmath405 , while the typical occupation number is @xmath406 .",
    "the density of the condensate is @xmath407 .      at @xmath401 , the flux of particles coming to",
    "the condensate from the hard modes becomes comparable to the lost of particles due to the parametric resonance .",
    "one can expect , therefore , that the decay of @xmath23 is now slower than @xmath409 .",
    "we make the following assumptions in the regime @xmath410 :    \\1 .",
    "@xmath411 , where @xmath412 is some unknown constant .    \\2 .",
    "the particle distribution outside the condensate has the self ",
    "similar form ( [ self_sim ] ) with some @xmath361 and @xmath362 .",
    "the loss of particles by condensate evaporation is compensated almost exactly by bose condensation .",
    "the change of @xmath23 with time is due to a small discrepancy between the rates of the two processes .",
    "the four  particle collisions can be neglected compared to three  particle ones .",
    "let us find @xmath361 , @xmath362 and @xmath412 .",
    "first , since the four  particle scattering can be neglected , the boltzmann equation has the same form as eq.([boltz_1/3 ] ) , where the factor of @xmath409 in the r.h.s.is replaced by @xmath413 , so @xmath414 as before , the energy conservation implies @xmath415 finally , the rate of particle creation by parametric resonance is @xmath416 . on other hand ,",
    "the number of particles outside the condensate is @xmath417 , so the flux of non  condensate particles coming back to the condensate is @xmath418 . according to our third assumption",
    ", the following relation should hold .",
    "@xmath419 from eqs.([p+q+r=1 ] ) , ( [ q=4p ] ) and ( [ 4r=1+p ] ) , one finds @xmath420 , @xmath421 , @xmath422 . matching with the previous regime at @xmath401 , the following formula",
    "is obtained @xmath423 @xmath424 as anticipated , @xmath23 decays slower than @xmath409 .",
    "now one can verify our starting assumptions .",
    "first , @xmath425 is much smaller than the rate of particle creation by parametric resonance @xmath426 if @xmath410 .",
    "therefore , particle loss is much smaller than the rate of evaporation by parametric resonance , which implies that the latter is compensated almost exactly by bose condensation .",
    "that the four  particle collisions can be neglected compared with three  particle ones can be checked easily : the l.h.s .  of eq.([4part ] ) is @xmath427 , while the r.h.s .",
    "is @xmath428 .",
    "since @xmath5 , this condition is always satisfied .",
    "therefore , all our starting assumptions are justified a posteriori .",
    "it is interesting to note that the four  particle scattering is negligible in the whole history of the evolution of the system : even when the density of the condensate is small , the dominant relaxation processes are those involving one condensate particle .",
    "the remnant of homogeneous oscillations , so , play an important role in the thermalization .",
    "the thermal equilibrium is achieved when the typical occupation number is of order 1 .",
    "this occurs at the the time moment @xmath429 naturally , the smaller the coupling , the larger the time required for thermalization .",
    "the residual particle density in the condensate at these times is @xmath430 for comparison , the density of particles outside the condensate is @xmath431 , which is much larger than @xmath23 .",
    "naturally , the condensate density will decrease further and tend to 0 .",
    "in this paper we have followed the evolution of the scalar field from the initial homogeneous oscillations to thermalization .",
    "we found that this evolutions is a rather complex process , occurring through following regimes :    \\1 .",
    "@xmath432 : exponential enhancement of resonance modes .",
    "this is the feature that makes our model similar to the ones considered in ref.@xcite .",
    "@xmath433 : particles with energy @xmath92 are produced with a roughly constant rate .",
    "@xmath298 : the typical energy of non  condensate particles is @xmath434 , and the typical occupation number is @xmath435 . most energy is still concentrated in the condensate , whose density remains approximately constant , @xmath436 .",
    "@xmath381 : the condensate density decays as @xmath437 .",
    "the typical energy and occupation number of non  condensate particles are @xmath438 and @xmath439 , respectively .",
    "@xmath440 : @xmath441 , @xmath442 , @xmath443 ,    the thermalization finishes at @xmath444 .    we see that in our model the hartree ",
    "fock approximation works only in the regime 1 and 2 , @xmath445 . at @xmath446",
    "our calculations give the rate of particle loss from the condensate twice smaller than predicted by the hartree ",
    "fock approximation .",
    "finally , at @xmath410 the scattering changes the decay law of the condensate , so instead of @xmath447 one has @xmath448 .    though all calculations in this paper are based on the existence of the additional small parameter @xmath4",
    ", one may expect that some features similar to those discovered in our model also occur in the some of the realistic theories .",
    "as one of them , we speculate that the exponential enhancement of the parametric resonance modes is terminated by the back  reaction of produced modes and the coherent nature of the latter may slow down the energy loss of the homogeneous oscillations .",
    "it is also natural to argue that the thermalization process takes a long time , during which some types of self  similar behavior of the distribution functions may have place in some models . hopefully , the techniques used in this paper may prove helpful in the understanding of the dynamics of the inflaton in these theories , which would provide more accurate physical predictions than those provided by the hartree  fock approximation .",
    "it is particularly interesting to compare our analytical results with the numerical simulations in the massless @xmath0 theory performed in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that though the massless @xmath0 theory lacks any additional small parameter beside @xmath3 , the width of the resonance band , as well as the value of the maximal index of exponential enhancement @xmath81 are numerically small in this model .",
    "therefore , one can expect that many qualitative features found in our model are also valid for the massless @xmath0 theory .",
    "though late thermalization epochs are not considered in ref.@xcite , the behavior of the field show many similarity with our model in earlier regimes . in particular , the fluctuations of the field comming from the non ",
    "condensate modes are relatively small at the end of the linear regime .",
    "the peaks in the spectrum are also found to be present during some time interval and they are shown to be caused by scattering processes . from the analogy with our model ,",
    "the bounces found in the time evolution of the amplitude of homogeneous oscillations can be attributed to the coherence of resonance modes , not to bose condensation as argued in ref.@xcite .    the author thanks p.  arnold and l.  yaffe for stimulating discussions , and l.  kofman and a.  linde for explaining many points of ref.@xcite .",

    "each coefficient of these exponents must be equal 0 , which gives us 7 equations .",
    "those corresponding to @xmath461 are the equations that determine @xmath462 .",
    "since @xmath462 do not emerge in other equations , these equations can be ignored .",
    "it turns out that we will need the coefficient of 1 and @xmath463 only with the accuracy of @xmath464 ( not @xmath465 ) . to this order ,",
    "terms proportional to 1 read @xmath466 while the equations corresponding to @xmath463 are @xmath467 and its complex conjugation .",
    "these equations relate @xmath468 and @xmath469 with @xmath470 , @xmath471 @xmath472 the term @xmath473 implies the following equation @xmath474 where we introduce the notations @xmath475 @xmath476 eq.([app * ] ) can be rewritten in the following form after taking into account eqs.([app_bc ] ) @xmath477    now let us turn to eq.([hf_eq1 ] ) . to the order of @xmath478",
    ", both sides can be expanded in terms proportional to @xmath479 , @xmath480 , @xmath481 and @xmath482 .",
    "we will not need the equation corresponding to @xmath481 and @xmath482 .",
    "moreover we will need the equation coming from the term @xmath483 with the accuracy of @xmath484 only , which has the form , @xmath485 form which one obtains , @xmath486 the equation coming from the terms containing @xmath487 is , @xmath488 @xmath489 together with eqs.([app_bc ] ) , ( [ app_b ] ) , and the condition that @xmath452 is real , one obtain the formula for @xmath490 , @xmath491 and the equation that @xmath452 satisfies , @xmath492 taking into account eqs.([app_b ] ) and ( [ app_omega ] ) , eq.([app_a1 ] ) can be rewritten as , @xmath493 from eq.([app_a ] ) and eq.([app_a2 ] ) , it is easy to verify the energy conservation , @xmath494",
    "so , one has @xmath495 where @xmath4 is the value of @xmath452 at @xmath16 when @xmath496 are still very small .",
    "eq.([app_a2 ] ) now can be rewritten in the final form , @xmath497 where @xmath498 is the center of the second resonance band in the linear regime .",
    "let us substitute eq.([boltz_ansatz ] ) to eq.([nnn ] ) . first consider the contribution from the first term in the parenthesis in eq.([nnn ] ) , @xmath499 the main contribution to this integral correspond to the case when one of the momenta @xmath500 , @xmath501 , or @xmath502 are equal 0 .",
    "the two former cases yields the same result , so this integral is reduced to @xmath503 @xmath504 let us evaluate the first integral in eq.([b:1st_contr ] ) .",
