    "usually the rotor @xmath10 is constructed applying two reflections in planes perpendicular to unit vectors @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 in this way defined rotor can be put into more convenient exponential form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the angle of rotation in a plane made up of @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 denotes the unit bivector , @xmath23 .    in practice , however , it is required to have a rotor which brings the end of a unit radius - vector @xmath24 to a new position @xmath25 .",
    "if @xmath19 is the angle between @xmath24 an @xmath25 then the rotation plane can be written as the outer product @xmath26 and angle @xmath19 can be expressed through the inner product @xmath27 .",

    "if @xmath24 and @xmath25 are mutually orthogonal , then the equation   simplifies to @xmath31 the rotor can also be put  @xcite in the form @xmath32 , which reduces to   after half angle formulas are applied .",
    "it is important to note , that two successive rotations can be always described by the composite rotation @xmath33 .",
    "however , the result of product of two rotors is not necessarily a rotor .",
    "the exception happens , in particular , when @xmath34 and @xmath35 belong to nonintersecting subspaces .",
    "_ rotation of blade and multivector_. the rotation of a blade relies on the extension of the outermorphism from vectors to multivectors  @xcite . since the outermorphism preserves the outer product and as a result the shape of geometric objects , this transformation induces a more general linear transformation in the full clifford space .",
    "for example , the rotation of the bivector @xmath36 gives new bivector @xmath37 having the same properties .",
    "to rotate general blade @xmath38 one rotates all the vectors @xmath39 in it @xmath40 ( the underbar denotes the outermorphism ) , so the rotation formula for blade @xmath41 has the same structure as for vector  , @xmath42 . in particular , the pseudoscalar is rotationally invariant @xmath43 .",
    "the formula remains valid if the blade is replaced by any multivector .",
    "general properties of rotation transformation @xmath44 of multivectors @xmath45 and @xmath46 are listed below .",
    "@xmath47 an important property of the outermorphism is that the outermorphism of the product of two functions @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the product of the outermorphisms , @xmath50    _ blade eigens_. the outermorphism allows to characterize the invariant subspaces under linear transformations . in particular",
    ", it allows to generalize the concept of the eigenblade  @xcite .",
    "indeed , if @xmath48 is a linear function then the equation @xmath51 is called the eigenblade equation or collineation transformation , where blade @xmath41 of grade @xmath52 is called eigenblade and @xmath53 is a real eigenvalue .",
    "frequently the outermorphism symbol ( underbar ) is omitted .",
    "for example , if @xmath3 and @xmath54 are vectors and function @xmath48 satisfies @xmath55 and @xmath56 , then by outermorphism extension we have @xmath57 , or @xmath58 .",
    "thus @xmath36 is the eigenbivector with eigenvalue @xmath59 .",
    "if applied to pseudoscalar @xmath60 the outermorphism can be used to define the determinant @xmath61 of linear transformation @xmath48 , @xmath62 without any need of matrices .",
    "for example , in",
    "_ _ cl__@xmath1 the determinant of @xmath48 as follows from is @xmath63 .",
    "the eigenvalue equation   can be rewritten in the form @xmath64 showing that the operator @xmath65 is singular .",
    "every singular operator has a vanishing determinant : @xmath66 where the last expression follows from  , the @xmath67 being @xmath52-grade pseudoscalar .",
    "this equation is called the secular equation for  @xmath48 , the solution of which with respect to @xmath53 gives the eigenvalues .",
    "for example , let @xmath48 be a vector - valued function @xmath68 of vector @xmath69 in _ _ cl__@xmath1 . if @xmath70 , then @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 . after expansion this equation reduces to scalar cubic equation @xmath74 where the scalar coefficients are @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "after the eigenvalues have been determined , the eigenblade equation   becomes algebraic multivector equation with respect to @xmath41 which can be solved by ga methods .",
    "example of applications of this approach can be found , for example , in the textbook  @xcite .",
    "the described method , however , is not a coordinate free , and is based on expansion of the transformation in a particular frame .",
    "_ spinor eigens_. the eigens , however , in many cases could be calculated in a compact way without any reference to determinant equation  .",
    "in particular , as we shall see , this is easy to do if the eigenequation @xmath78 for spinor @xmath79 that consists of a sum of even - grade blades can be transformed to an eigenequation for a corresponding rotor . in quantum mechanics the transformation @xmath80 is called the hamiltonian and @xmath81 is the energy ( scalar ) .",
    "the reformulation of eigen problem   may be realized if one observes that in many quantum mechanical problems there is a specific direction called the quantization axis ( @xmath82-axis ) . as we shall see this allows to reduce quantum mechanical eigenmultivector equation to a single rotor equation , where the quantization axis is rotated to some final direction determined by the hamiltonian of the problem .",
    "it is important to note that , in contrast to hilbert space formulation where the quantization axis is hidden in the structure of the hamiltonian , in ga this axis appears explicitly .",
    "in other words the quantization axis , represented below by @xmath83 basis vector , appears directly in the hamiltonian function .",
    "the proposed method is based on this quantum mechanical hamiltonian property and allows us to construct a single optimal rotor expressed in coordinate - free way , which is very similar to rotor   or  , where the vectors @xmath84 and @xmath54 are given by eigenequation  .",
