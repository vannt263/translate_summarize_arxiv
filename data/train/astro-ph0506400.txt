    "as recently stated in the masterly review by @xcite , the last two years have seen a renewal of interest in the cosmological role of cosmic strings , after more than a decade of relative quiescence : an interest which was mainly triggered by the discovery of the unusual object csl-1 ( r.a.@xmath0 ; @xmath1 ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) in the oac - df ( osservatorio astronomico di capodimonte - deep field ; @xcite ) and by the indirect evidence obtained by @xcite from the luminosity fluctuations of the quasar @xmath3 .",
    "csl-1 ( see fig.[csl1 ] ) is a double source laying in a low density field . in the original images",
    "the components , 1.9 arcsec apart , appeared to be extended and with roundish and identical shapes . by low resolution",
    "spectroscopy we learned that both components are at a redshift of @xmath4 , and by photometry ( both global properties and luminosity profiles ) that they match the properties of two giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "detailed analysis showed that the spectra of the two components were identical at a 99.9% level .",
    "such a conclusion , however , was hindered both by the limited wavelength range spanned by the spectra , and by their relatively low signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "as discussed in paper i , the only possible explanation of the csl-1 properties is : _",
    "i ) _ either an unlikely chance alignment of two giant ellipticals at the same redshift and with very similar spectra , or _",
    "ii ) _ a gravitational lensing phenomenon . but in this second case , due to the lack of asymmetry in the two images , the lens could not be modelled with the standard lensing by a massive compact source . actually , the usual gravitational lenses , i.e. those formed by bound clumps of matter , always produce inhomogeneous gravitational fields which distort the images of extended background sources ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the detailed modelling of csl-1 proved that the two images were virtually undistorted ( see paper i for details ) . the only other explanation left in the framework of the gravitational lensing theory was that of a lensing by a cosmic string .",
    "in paper i we indicated two possible _ experimenta crucis _ : _",
    "i ) _ the detection of the sharp edges at faint light levels , since this is the signature expected from the lensing by a cosmic string , and _",
    "ii ) _ the detection of a small amplitude but sharp discontinuity in the local cmb @xcite . the first test calls for high angular resolution and deep observations with hst ; time has already been allocated but the observations have not yet been performed .",
    "the second test was attempted using the preliminary release of the wmap data @xcite . by careful processing , a @xmath5 positive detection at the position of csl-1",
    "was found . even though such a detection seems to imply the unrealistic speed of @xmath6 for the string",
    ", the authors pointed out that both the low angular resolution and the low s / n ratio could prevent the detection of the expected signature .",
    "another test was proposed by several authors @xcite , and more recently in @xcite .",
    "it is based on the fact that the alignment of the background object ( a galaxy ) inside the deficit angle of the string is a stochastic process determined by the area of the lensing strip and by the surface density distribution of the extragalactic objects which are laying behind the string .",
    "all the lensed objects will fall inside a narrow strip defined by the deficit angle computed along the string pattern .",
    "a preliminary investigation of the csl-1 field showed a significant excess of gravitational lens candidates selected on the bases of photometric criteria only @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic observations are being obtained for a first set of candidates and will be discussed elsewhere .    in this paper",
    "we address on firmer grounds the issue of the gravitational lens nature of csl-1 using intermediate resolution spectra obtained at the eso very large telescope + fors 1 spectrograph .",
    "new spectra of csl-1 were obtained in march 2005 at vlt using the fors 1 spectrograph under director s discretionary time ( proposal 274.a-5039 ) .",
    "the spectra were acquired on march 15 - 19 2005 in the fors 1 long slit configuration 600v+gg435 ( @xmath7 at central wavelength ) , setting the slit of the spectrograph across the centers of the two components of csl-1 .",
    "the observations were split in several exposures , to prevent saturation and to allow for a better removal of the bad pixels and cosmic rays .",
    "the risk of cross contamination between the spectra of the two components was minimized by retaining only the 6 frames with an average signal to noise ( s / n ) ratio of @xmath8 and a psf fwhm@xmath9 , for a total exposure time of 4740 sec .    during observations a short @xmath10-band exposure was also obtained to check the pointing of the instrument .",
    "owing to the excellent seeing conditions , this image could be used to test the extended nature and the similarity of the light profiles of the two images . the dot - dashed line ( with no data symbols ) in figure  [ lightprofile ] shows the light profile of an unresolved star present in the field , compared to the light profiles of the two images of csl-1 , which appear to be clearly resolved and identical within the errors . a de vaucouler fit yields @xmath11 .",
    "the spectral data were reduced through standard midas procedures and , after bias subtraction , flat fielding , wavelength calibration , and sky subtraction , the spectra were re - aligned to correct for dithering and stacked . since the shift values were set to an integer number of pixels , no re  sampling was applied , in order not to affect the noise statistics .",
    "the stacking was performed using a simple median filter to reject cosmic rays .",
    "the spectra of each component was extracted using a 5 pixel strip ( 1 pix=0.21 \" ) centered on the emission peak with the purpose of maximizing the s / n ratio . in a similar way , the background counts were extracted in two stripes located 40 pixels from each component so to measure the local background while minimizing the contribution from the source .",
    "the error on the spectral counts was calculated with the following expression : @xmath12 where : @xmath13 are the source counts measured along the spectrum , @xmath14 are the number of median averaged exposures , @xmath15 is the instrumental gain , and @xmath16 represents the background r.m.s . measured over @xmath17 pixels centered at each wavelength . by folding the images we estimate an average cross - contamination of @xmath18 .",
    "the resulting spectra and their ratio are shown in figure  [ spectra ] .",
    "no flux calibration was applied to the data .",
    "it has to be stressed that the narrow spikes visible in the figure are residuals left after the removal of bright sky lines .",
    "the spectra of the two components turned out to be identical at visual inspection .",
    "in fact pearson s , spearman , and kendall correlation tests indicate correlation coefficients of @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath20 respectively , with a significance of @xmath21 in all cases .",
    "the degree of similarity was further quantified by running a @xmath22 test both on the whole wavelength range and on the most prominent spectral absorption features , namely ca ii ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) , h@xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 lines and @xmath28 band . the test yields @xmath29 implying that the two spectra are consistent within @xmath30 ( 80% ) ; we also compared the distribution of the observed differences to the frequencies expected in the case of pure gaussian noise , finding that the two are consistent at the 95% level and that there is no deterministic part in the residuals . an even better agreement ( @xmath31 )",
    "is found for the individual absorption features . to further check",
    "if the observed consistency can be due to the known similarity of early - type galaxies we repeated the test on a sample of spectra extracted from the sdss _ luminous red galaxies _ , chosen to have a redshift difference and s / n comparable with the csl1 data .",
    "we performed 2000 comparisons obtaining that @xmath32 of the examined sdss spectra are as consistent as the spectra of the two csl1 components .",
    "a cross correlation test based on the spectral lines mentioned above yelds a velocity difference between the two components of @xmath33 km s@xmath34 . if however we exclude the @xmath35 line which is affected by residual instrumental effects this figure reduces to @xmath36 km s@xmath34 .",
    "the similarity of the spectra of the two components of csl-1 and the zero velocity shift between them strongly support the interpretation of csl-1 in terms of gravitational lensing .",
    "the data obtained so far do not allow to completely rule out the possibility of a chance alignment of two giant ellipticals but the new data presented in this paper make such an alignment very unlikely . in the case of chance alignment ,",
    "in fact , the two images of csl-1 would correspond to two giant ellipticals with identical shapes and spectra , placed at the same redshift .",
    "the probability of finding two ellipticals of @xmath37 within 2 \" ( 20 kpc ) and with a radial distance @xmath38 mpc ( @xmath39 upper limit ) is @xmath40 , accounting for clustering effects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) dv_1 dv_2 $ ] were @xmath41 is the space density of elliptical galaxies , @xmath42 is the galaxy correlation function , @xmath43 is the volume enclosing the two galaxies and @xmath44 is the volume of the survey . ] . integrating over the volume sampled by the oac - deep field for a galaxy of the same magnitude as csl-1",
    "we calculate that we expect to find @xmath45 pairs in the whole survey .",
    "including the spectral similarity we obtain an upper limit of @xmath46 . as it was already mentioned in paper i , this could still be explained if csl-1 belonged to a rich cluster with two central dominant galaxies , but this is not the case .",
    "careful inspection of the csl-1 field shows in fact that it is a rather isolated object with no other nearby galaxies of comparable brightness ; furthermore the velocity difference measured from the two spectra is much smaller that the one expected in a rich cluster ( @xmath47 km s@xmath34 ) .    in the gravitational lensing scenario ,",
    "as already stated in paper i , the observed phenomenology can not be understood in terms of lensing by compact clumps of matter such as , for instance , a singular isothermal sphere model or any other model listed in the c.r .",
    "keeton s lens modeling software @xcite . the only possible type of lens which can produce a morphology similar to that observed in csl-1 seems to be a cosmic string @xcite .",
    "lensing by a cosmic string seems capable to explain all the observational evidences gathered so far and deserves further investigation .",
    "cosmic strings were predicted by @xcite and their role in cosmology has been extensively discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "recent work @xcite has also shown their relevance for both fundamental physics and cosmology .",
    "in particular it has become apparent that the detection of a cosmic string would lead to a direct measure of the energy scale of symmetry breaking in gut theories .",
    "if we assume that csl-1 is produced by a cosmic string , its measured properties would imply a linear density of the string of order of @xmath48 and a corresponding energy scale of gut of @xmath49 gev @xcite .",
    "hopefully the question on the nature of csl1 will soon be answered by our hst observations approved in cycle 14 to carry out the test proposed by the authors in paper i and which will allow to verify the cosmic string hypothesis on firmer grounds .",
