    "ultra - luminous compact x - ray sources ( ulxs ) have been found in nearby spiral galaxies , with typical 0.5  10 kev luminosities @xmath0 to @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 ( e.g. , fabbiano 1988 ; colbert and mushotzky 1999 ; makishima et al .",
    "these luminosities are too small for agns , and most ulxs are actually located significantly far from the optical photometric center of the galaxies .",
    "significant time variations have been detected from ulxs , and their energy spectra are fitted well with optically thick accretion disk models ( okada et al .  1998 ; mizuno et al .  1999 ; makishima et al .",
    "these observational facts suggest that the ulxs are moderately massive black holes , which may be scale - up versions of the galactic black holes in the `` high '' state ( = soft - state ) , in which the soft thermal spectrum is established to be emission from optically thick accretion disks . so that the observed luminosity ( assuming isotropic emission ) does not exceed the eddington limit @xmath3 erg s@xmath2 , the black hole mass will have to be up to @xmath4 .",
    "in addition to that the energy spectra are fitted with optically thick accretion disk models , recently found bimodal spectral transitions from two ulxs ic342 ( kubota et al .  2000 ) will further demonstrate their resemblance with the galactic black hole candidates .",
    "grs 1915 + 105 and gro j165540 are the two well - studied galactic super - luminal jet sources , and the latter is an established black hole binary with mass measurement of the central source ( @xmath5 ; orosz and bailyn 1997 ) .",
    "although these x - ray energy spectra are basically fitted with an optically thick accretion disk plus power - law , which is a canonical model for the high - state black hole candidates , it has been noticed that the characteristic disk color temperature of the jet sources can be as high as @xmath61.3  2.0 kev ( e.g. , belloni et al .",
    "1997 ; zhang et al .  1997a",
    "; tomsick et al .",
    "1999 ) ; this is systematically higher than other non - jet , well - studied black hole candidates such as cyg x-1 and lmc x-3 , whose disk temperatures are almost always less than @xmath7 1 kev .",
    "interestingly , the unusually high disk color temperature , @xmath7 1.5  1.8 kev , is also observed from the ulxs in ic342 ( okada et al .",
    "1998 ) , ngc4565 ( mizuno et al .  1999 ) and other galaxies ; in fact this seems to be a common spectral characteristic of the ulxs ( makishima et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "below , we briefly explain how the characteristic disk temperature is determined , and why `` the too - high disk temperature '' problem is of importance .",
    "let s assume the schwarzschild metric , in which case the last stable orbit around the non - rotating black hole will be @xmath8 .",
    "we consider the accretion disk whose inner disk radius reaches the last stable orbit , when the disk will be hottest and the conversion efficiency is 0.057 .",
    "then the radial dependence of the `` effective '' temperature of an optically accretion disk may be written as , @xmath9 where @xmath10 includes minor general relativistic correction and reduces to @xmath11 in the newtonian case .",
    "the effective temperature will be maximum at @xmath12 , where the `` color '' temperature also reaches the peak , as precise disk spectral calculations indicate that the ratio of the two temperatures , @xmath13 , is virtually constant at @xmath14 along the disk radius , as long as the @xmath7 1  10 kev energy band is concerned ( shimura and takahara 1995 ; ross and fabian 1996 ) .    therefore , the maximum disk color temperature in the schwarzschild metric may be written as @xmath15 where we define the eddington mass accretion rate as @xmath16 g s@xmath2 , so that @xmath17 gives the eddington luminosity . from this formula , we can see that an optically thick accretion disk around a 7 @xmath18 schwarzschild black hole may not be hotter than the color temperature @xmath6 1.3 kev .",
    "note that as the mass increases the maximum disk temperature decreases with @xmath19 , which is the reason that the agn blue bumps appear in the uv band .",
    "we show examples of the observed `` too - hot '' accretion disks in gro j165540 and an ulx in ic342 ( figure 1 ) . on the left panel of figure 1",
    ", we show an asca gis spectrum of gro j165540 in 1995 august , when the source is in one of the brightest states .",
    "the energy spectrum may be fitted with an optically thick accretion disk model plus a power - law tail which extends up to the batse energy band with a photon - index of @xmath20 ( zhang et al .",
    "contribution of the hard - tail in the asca band below 10 kev ( the yellow line in the panel ) is rather minor and will not affect the discussion of the optically thick accretion disk model .",
    "we applied a schwarzschild disk model by hanawa ( 1989 ) with the distance and inclination angle being fixed at 3.2 kpc and @xmath21 respectively ( orosz and bailyn 1997 ) , and @xmath22 .",
    "we show the best - fit model which was obtained by allowing both mass and mass accretion rate to be free ; we have obtained a too small mass @xmath23 , with @xmath24 g s@xmath2 ( @xmath25=0.25 ) .",
    "if we fix the mass at @xmath26 , we may not achieve an acceptable fit , as the model spectrum is too soft ( also shown in the panel ) .",
    "the right panel in figure 1 indicates an asca spectrum of the `` source 1 '' in ic342 observed in september 1993 when the source is in the high state ( okada et al .",
    "the observed luminosity was @xmath27 erg s@xmath2 , assuming the most likely distance of 4 mpc ( okada et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) and isotropic emission , thus @xmath28 is expected so that the luminosity does not exceed the eddington limit .",
    "we fit the observed spectrum with the schwarzschild disk model by hanawa ( 1989 ) , allowing the mass and mass accretion rate to be free parameters , assuming the face - on geometry .",
    "the best - fit model gives @xmath29 and @xmath30 g s@xmath2 ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "obviously , such a super - eddington luminosity is very unlikely . even if we assume a possible minimum distance of 1.5 mpc ( okada et al .",
    "1998 ) , @xmath32 and the super - eddington problem is not solved .",
    "note that changing the inclination angle does not help , as both @xmath33and @xmath34 are proportional to @xmath35 and their ratio is invariant . for a comparison ,",
    "we have shown a schwarzschild disk model spectrum with @xmath36 at the eddington limit ; it is obvious that the observed spectrum is much harder than the model spectrum .",
    "a naive solution to explain the apparently hard disk spectrum may be to allow @xmath13 to be much greater than 1.7 , in which case the effective temperature of the disk remains the same , but significant comptonization in the upper - layer hardens the disk spectra .",
    "this is an idea by borozdin et al .",
    "( 1998 ) who adopted @xmath37 for gro j165540 a posteriori so that the mass derived from the x - ray model fitting agrees with the dynamical mass , as @xmath38 , the disk luminosity @xmath39 is proportional to @xmath40 , in which from x - ray spectral fitting we can determine @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , @xmath43 . ] .    however , it is unlikely that @xmath44 holds universally .",
    "first , the spectral hardening factor can be calculated by solving the vertical radiative transfer in the disk , and several independent calculations ( e.g. , shimura and takahara 1995 ; ross and fabian 1996 ) indicate that @xmath45 is in the range of 1.5  1.9 for reasonable values of the @xmath46 parameter .",
    "second , assuming @xmath47 , the black hole mass estimated from the x - ray spectral fitting agrees fairly well with the dynamical mass derived from optical observations for most high - state black hole candidates such as lmc x-3 ( ebisawa et al .",
    "1993 ) and cyg x-1 ( dotani et al .",
    "if we apply @xmath37 for other well - known black hole candidates , we will end up with unusually high black hole masses ( shrader and titarchuk 1999 ) .",
    "also , application to the accretion disks in neutron star binaries will give too large masses which are not allowed for neutron stars .",
    "instead of the standard optically thick disk in which all the released gravitational energy is thermalized and goes into the radiation , if energy transfer due to advection is introduced , we will have a different accretion disk structure and spectrum .",
    "watarai et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2001 ) considered the optically thick advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) model ( slim - disk ) which may be valid near the eddington limit .",
    "they pointed out that this model may explain the hard disk spectrum of the super - luminal jet sources as well as apparently small inner disk radii .    according to watarai et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2001 ) , @xmath48 holds in the optically thick adaf model , as opposed to @xmath49 which is the case for the standard disk . to examine this hypothesis ,",
    "we have calculated an accretion disk model with @xmath48 and applied to the asca spectrum of gro j1655 - 40 . as a result",
    ", we obtained a very poor fit with a reduced @xmath50 of @xmath7 40 .",
    "this is unfavorable to the optically thick adaf model , though more precise spectral calculation and detailed comparison with the observation will be of interest .      in the schwarzschild metric",
    ", the last stable orbit around the black hole is @xmath51 , while in the kerr metric it can go down to @xmath52 for the prograde case with an extreme angular momentum of @xmath53 .",
    "if the inner edge of the accretion disk approaches the black hole accordingly , the local disk temperature can get higher , hence may explain the too - hot accretion disk spectra ( zhang et al .",
    "1997b ; makishima et al .",
    "2000 ) . to examine this hypothesis",
    ", we have to calculate the kerr disk model taken into account full relativisitic effects .",
    "precise kerr disk model calculations have been carried out by several authors including asaoka ( 1989 ) , laor et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and gieliski et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2000 ) . in this paper",
    ", we calculate the kerr disk spectrum using the transfer function computed by laor et al .",
    "( 1990 ) for @xmath53 ( when the conversion efficiency becomes 0.366 and @xmath54 g s@xmath2 ) . to make the relativistic effects more apparent , we assume a constant @xmath13 and do not take into account the inclination dependent limb - darkening , which laor et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and gieliski et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2000 ) considered .",
    "the calculated energy spectra are shown in figure 2 for several inclination angles .",
    "we see that the energy spectra are strongly dependent on the inclination angle in higher energy bands . at lower energies , where most of the emission is from the outer parts of the disk , the flux decreases with @xmath35 . on the other hand , the hard emission from innermost parts of the disk ( @xmath55 )",
    "is _ enhanced _ as the disk is more inclined , due to strong light bending and doppler boosting .",
    "when the disk is close to face - on , the contribution from the inner most part is small , as gravitational red - shift is dominant ; as a result , the total disk spectrum is not so much different from the schwarzschild one . as the disk approaches to edge - on , however , contribution from the innermost part gets dominant in the highest band , as a result total disk spectrum becomes much harder than the schwarzschild disk .",
    "we have applied the kerr disk model to gro j165540 and the source 1 in ic342 . for gro j165540 , the inclination angle",
    "is fixed to @xmath56 and @xmath57 is assumed .",
    "if we allow the mass and mass accretion rate to be free , we obtain @xmath58 and @xmath59 g s@xmath2 ( @xmath60 ) . compared to the fit with schwarzschild disk model ( @xmath23 ) , significant increase of the mass",
    "does indicate the spectral hardening of the kerr disk model with a large inclination angle .",
    "in fact , the derived mass is too large , and further tuning of the angular momentum @xmath61 will be required to achieve the realistic mass ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "gieliski et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2000 ) calculated the kerr disk model for several different @xmath61 values , and found that @xmath63 gives @xmath64 for gro j165540 .",
    "the ic 342 fit with the face - on kerr disk model gives ( assuming @xmath65= 4 mpc ) @xmath66 and @xmath67 g s@xmath2 ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "only a factor of @xmath7 2 increase of the mass is due to slight hardening of the face - on kerr disk model compared to the schwarzschild one .",
    "note that the super - eddington problem is not solved .",
    "if we assume @xmath69 , we obtain @xmath70 and @xmath71 g s@xmath2 ( @xmath72 )",
    ". then the super - eddington problem will be almost solved , but such a large mass seems to be unlikely . also , it is very unlikely that most of the accretion disks in ulxs are inclined when seen from the earth .",
    "therefore , a kerr disk interpretation of the ulxs will be problematic , unless considering some other mechanisms to make the disk spectra apparently harder .",
