    "the formation scenario of solitary recycled pulsars is still under discussion , but it is widely believed that the pulsar s companion either gets evaporated ( a process which is believed to be at work e.g.  in the psr  b1957 + 20 millisecond pulsar / binary system ) or that the system gets tidally disrupted after the formation of the millisecond pulsar . whatever the mechanism is , it is interesting to note that the ratio of solitary to binary millisecond pulsars in globular clusters is almost identical to the 40% observed in the population of galactic disk millisecond pulsars ( cf .",

    "figure  [ figure1 ] illustrates the cataloged distribution of x - ray and radio millisecond pulsars in each of the 26 globular clusters known to host millisecond pulsars .",
    "the first millisecond pulsar found in a globular cluster was psr  j1824 - 2452a ( lyne et al .",
    "1987 ) which is located in ngc 6626 ( m28 ) .",
    "psr  j1824 - 2452a is not only the youngest ( @xmath4 yrs ) but also the most powerful ( @xmath5 erg s@xmath6 ) and brightest x - ray pulsar in a globular cluster .",
    "x - ray emission from it was first detected in rosat hri data ( danner et al .",
    "1997 ) . with an angular resolution of @xmath7",
    "( hew ) the hri , though , did not fully allow to resolve its emission into a point source .",
    "it therefore was unclear whether the pulsar powers a plerion or its x - ray emission was partly due to a superposition of multiple discrete cluster sources surrounding it .",
    "today we know that sub - arcsecond spatial resolution is required to adequately study globular cluster sources in the x - ray band .",
    "chandra resolved psr  j1824 - 2452a into a point source along with 12 other x - ray sources surrounding it within the cluster s @xmath8 core radius @xcite .",
    "apparently they are the cause of the diffuse x - ray emission seen to surround psr  j1824 - 2452a in the rosat hri data .",
    "psr  j1824 - 2452a is a strong non - thermal x - ray emitter ( cf .",

    "the x - ray pulse profile is characterized by narrow peaks and small features with a high fraction of pulsed photons ( saito et al .",
    "1997 ; becker & trmper 1999 ; rutledge et al .",
    "2004 ) . as thermal emission can not be beamed strong enough to explain the narrow pulse peaks and high pulsed fraction , both the spectral and temporal emission properties are in agreement with the interpretation that its x - ray emission is caused by non - thermal radiation processes in the pulsar s magnetosphere .",
    "this is similar to what is observed in some other galactic plane millisecond pulsars ( becker 2009 ; zavlin 2007 ; becker & trmper 1999 ) .",
    "however , the data quality available from all those pulsars is far from being homogenous .",
    "whereas from several of these sources high quality spectral , temporal and spatial information is available , for many others , especially those in globular clusters , the photon statistics is small .",
    "this is especially true for most of the pulsars seen in 47  tuc . for this cluster grindlay",

    "nineteen of the soft / faint sources were found to be positionally coincident with millisecond radio pulsars .",
    "most turned out to have a soft x - ray spectrum ( bogdanov et al .",
    "2006 ) and an x - ray luminosity in the range @xmath11 ergs  s@xmath6 , which is about two to three orders of magnitudes smaller than that of psr  j1824 - 2452a .",

    "2010 ) , including 47 tuc ( webb & kndlseder 2010 ) .    as demonstrated by the examples above , the brightness and hardness of globular cluster pulsars spans a very wide range . of the 140 cluster millisecond pulsars known today only few are found to have an x - ray counterpart . to increase this sample and to study their emission properties",
    "more systematically is the motivation for this paper .",
    "the structure is as follows : in  2 we describe the source detection and identification along with the spectral and timing analysis of the detected millisecond pulsar counterparts .",
    "their emission properties compared to those observed in galactic plane millisecond pulsars are discussed in  3 .",
    "a decade after the launch of chandra 18 out of the 26 globular clusters which are known to host millisecond pulsars were observed with the acis and/or hrc detector in focus .",
    "we made use of all data publicly available by spring 2010 .",
    "for counterpart searches and/or spectral analysis there are 45 acis - s / i and 5 hrc - i observations available , summing up to a total of 1.566,419 ksec and 52.442 ksec of good data .",

    "standard processed level-2 data were used in all counterpart searches .",
    "prior to the data analysis , aspect offsets for each observation , which is a function of the spacecraft roll angle , was carefully checked and corrected .",
    "the data analysis was restricted to the @xmath12  kev energy range .      to search for x - ray counterparts in the available datasets we used the wavelet and celdetect algorithms as implemented in the ciao 4.2 software package .",
    "source positions were then correlated with the radio timing positions of the globular cluster millisecond pulsars . to assess all identifications we computed the probability for a chance coincidence according to @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath14 is the number of x - ray sources detected within a search region of radius @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xmath17 are the positional uncertainties in right ascension and declination .",
    "the latter was determined by combining the errors of the radio pulsar and x - ray source positions in quadrature , considering chandra s absolute astrometric accuracy to be @xmath18 .",
    "this astrometric accuracy was estimated from the distribution of aspect offsets for a sample of point sources with accurately known celestial positions .",
    "there are @xmath19 of 237 sources imaged with acis - s which have offsets smaller than or equal to @xmath20 .",
    "as all the data used for counterpart searches were taken with the acis - s we included this value in our error budget computation for each coordinate . for the search radius @xmath15 we used the globular cluster half - mass radius as most of the pulsars lie within this region .",
    "the pulsar psr  j@xmath21c in ngc  6752 , though , is located outside this radius so that we expanded the search region for this cluster to 3 arcmin .",

    "with respect to their analysis we included the hrc - s observation taken in 2006 which almost doubles the number of photons available for the chandra timing analysis of psr  j1824 - 2452a .",
    "this allowed us to measure the pulse arrival time , fraction of pulsed photons , the width of the two x - ray pulses and the pulse phase separation of the two peaks by using the chandra data alone .",
    "as chandra is an imaging instrument it allows to measure the pulse properties by its better signal - to - noise ratio with much higher accuracy than using xte data only .    selecting all events from within a circle of 1.5 arcsec radius centered on the pulsar position gave us a total of 773 counts to construct a pulse profile by period folding ( buccheri & de jager 1989 ) .",

    "the column density is fully consistent with what is deduced from the reddening towards m28 .",
    "the unabsorbed energy flux in the @xmath100 kev band is @xmath101 , yielding an x - ray luminosity of @xmath102 .",
    "if transformed to the @xmath103 kev rosat band this corresponds to @xmath104 , which is comparable with the luminosity inferred from the rosat data ( verbunt 2001 ) .",
    "these luminosities imply a rotational energy @xmath105 to x - ray energy conversion factor of @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively .",
    "the phase averaged photon index obtained in our spectral fits is identical to the one deduced for psr  j1824 - 2452a from the observations at pulse maximum using joint asca and rxte data ( kuiper et al .",

    "table 6.7 of becker 2009 for a summary ) , modeling the x - ray spectrum of psr  j1824 - 2452a with a power - law does not require any additional blackbody component ( e.g.  associated with thermal emission from heated polar caps ) to get an acceptable spectral fit .",
    "all combinations of blackbody normalizations and temperatures that were fitted along the power - law model gave reduced @xmath109-values which did nt indicate a higher likelihood for such a model than the fits to a single power - law .",
    "the f - test statistic for adding the extra blackbody spectral component to the power - law model , thus , is very low .",
    "nevertheless , the high photon statistics provided by the archival chandra data allows us to constrain the temperature of a presumed thermal polar cap . defining the size of the polar cap as the foot points of the neutron star s dipolar magnetic field , the radius of the polar cap area is given by @xmath110 with @xmath111 being the neutron star radius , c the velocity of light and p the pulsar rotation period ( see e.g.  michel 1991 ) . for psr  j1824 - 2452a , with a rotation period of 3.05",
    "ms this yields a polar cap radius of @xmath112 km .    as a thermal spectral component of a heated polar cap contributes mostly below @xmath113 kev , the fitted column absorption is found to be a steep function of the blackbody emitting area ( corresponding to the model normalization ) and temperature . to determine a polar cap temperature upper limit which is in agreement with the fitted power - law model and column absorption we fixed the absorption of the composite model as well as the power - law photon index to the upper bound set by the @xmath41 confidence range deduced in the power - law fit .",
    "the power - law normalization was fixed to the @xmath41 lower bound as this led to a higher temperature upper limit .",

    "we thus obtain a normalization of 21.88 . assuming a contribution from one polar cap only we can set a @xmath22 temperature upper limit of @xmath117 k. this upper limit is at the same level as the temperatures fitted for the thermal components in the spectra of e.g.  the solitary millisecond pulsar psr  j@xmath118 or of psr  j@xmath1195 ( cf .",

    "31 of them are located in nine globular clusters .",
    "coherent x - ray pulses are detected from 10 millisecond pulsars of which four are in a globular cluster .",
    "these are psr j0024 - 7204d , o , r in 47 tuc for which we measured a pulsed fraction of @xmath122 and psr j1824 - 2452a in m28 which has @xmath123 of its x - rays pulsed .",

    "psr j0024 - 7204d shows an asymmetry in the main radio peak as the x - ray peaks do .",
    "the profile of psr j0024 - 7204r is characterized by a narrow x - ray peak followed by a broader pulse component covering the remaining rotation phase .",
    "the profile at 1400 mhz shows a striking gross similarity , consisting of a narrow main pulse and a broader pulse component which by itself has a sub - structure ( freire et al . , 2010 , in prep .",
    "clearly , a better photon statistics is required in order to establish this correspondence .",
    "36 of the 67 millisecond pulsars which we have considered in this work are in binaries .",
    "x - ray flux variability either on time scales comparable with the pulsar s orbit period or even longer was found for only three of them ; the binary pulsars psr j0024 - 7204w in 47 tuc , psr j1748 - 2021b in ngc 6440 and psr j1740 - 5340 in ngc 6397 .",
    "some low - significant evidence for a flux variability along their binary motion was found for psr j1824 - 2452h and j1824 - 2452 g .",
    "spectral information is available from all 31 globular cluster millisecond pulsar counterparts ( cf .",
    "table [ t : gc_psr_spec ] ) .",
    "the complexity of the spectral models which could be tested and the accuracy of the fitted spectral parameters , however , are strongly inhomogeneous among all of them .",
    "this is not only because of a diversity of the column absorption towards the various clusters but also because of varying photon statistics , which for fainter sources often do not even allow to distinguish between simple blackbody and power - law spectral models .",

    "figure  2 in becker et al .",
    "the new data taken in 2008 supersede the previous data in photon statistics and sensitivity and do not confirm the presence of this feature .",
    "a @xmath22 temperature upper limit of @xmath129 k is deduced for a presumed thermal polar cap contribution .",
    "this is at the same level as observed in spectral fits of other millisecond pulsars . that non - thermal radiation is the dominating emission component in psr  j1824 - 2452a thus does not exclude the existence of a thermal polar cap of similar properties than observed in e.g.  psr j0437 - 4715 or psr j2124 - 3358 ( cf .",
    "table 6.7 in becker 2009 ) .",
    "the 47 tuc pulsars all fit relatively well with a thermal spectrum or a composite spectral model consisting of a blackbody and power - law .",
    "the latter model especially fits the spectra of e.g.  psr j0024 - 7204o , r for which x - ray pulses are detected .",
    "grindlay et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggested that the x - ray efficiency for the 47  tuc millisecond pulsars is @xmath130 .",
    "such dependence is obviously less steep than the linear relation @xmath131 found for the isotropic x - ray luminosity of rotation - powered pulsars by becker & trmper ( 1997 ) .",
    "bogdanov et al .  ( 2006 ) found a relation of @xmath132 for the 47tuc pulsars using more significant chandra data taken in september / october 2002 .",
    "we have reexamined the isotropic x - ray conversion efficiency of the globular cluster pulsar population in adding the results reported in this paper into the data pool . to compute the spin - down power @xmath105 of the globular cluster pulsars we used the estimated intrinsic spin - down rate",
    "@xmath133 reported in the literature .",
    "pulsars which turned out to be variable were excluded from the correlation . as both ,",
    "emission from heated polar caps and non - thermal emission finally appears to be powered by the rotation of the star the x - ray luminosities from both spectral components were added and correlated with @xmath105 . adopting the absorption - corrected isotropic x - ray luminosity listed in table [ t : gc_psr_spec ] and its statistical 1-@xmath134 error we fitted @xmath135 with a correlation coefficient 0.68 .    correlating the spin - down energy and isotropic x - ray luminosity of @xmath136 rotation - powered pulsars for which spectral information was obtained in chandra and/or xmm - newton observations becker ( 2009 )",
    "fitted @xmath137 in which the errors in @xmath138 have been fully taken into account and were used to weight the data points .",
    "although the data includes three times as much pulsars than were available with rosat the correlation is still in good agreement with @xmath139 ( cf .",
    "figure [ figure18 ] ) . with the larger database",
    "it now becomes evident that this relation represents an averaged approximation to the x - ray efficiency rather than a fixed correlation .",
    "this was already suggested by becker & trmper ( 1997 ) and may be due to the fact that rosat with its limited sensitivity was able to detect essentially only the brightest pulsars . with the higher sensitivity of xmm - newton and chandra more faint pulsars",
    "could be detected in which e.g.  the orientation of their magnetic / rotational axes to the observers line of sight might not have been optimal . as no beaming correction can be applied to the observed luminosities the x - ray efficiency of those pulsars appears to be smaller , even though their spin - down energy might be comparable to more efficient emitters .",
    "as far as the x - ray efficiency from the globular cluster millisecond pulsars is concerned it can be seen from figure [ figure19 ] that their x - ray luminosities are well within the scatter of other data points at this spin - down energy level . within the uncertainties of the deduced x - ray luminosities",
    "it is therefore not justified to conclude that these pulsars have an x - ray efficiency which is different from the one observed for e.g.  field millisecond pulsars .",
    "millisecond pulsars in the galactic plane and in globular clusters thus appear to show no distinct differences in their x - ray emission properties .",
