    "half a century ago , jaynes established the maximum entropy ( maxent ) principle as a method of inference for the solution of indeterminate problems of all kinds @xcite , based on the relative entropy function ( the negative kullback - leibler @xcite function ) : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the probability of the @xmath2th distinguishable category or choice within a system , from @xmath3 such categories , and @xmath4 is the source or `` prior '' probability of category @xmath2 .",
    "maximization of , subject to the constraints on a system , yields its `` least informative '' or `` maximally noncommittal '' probability distribution . using the generic `` jaynes relations '' , this",
    "can then be used to infer the macroscopic properties of the system .",
    "jaynes method has been applied to the analysis of a vast number of phenomena throughout most fields of human study ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and can be regarded as one of the most important discoveries of science .",
    "three decades ago , a new principle was proposed by paltridge for the analysis of flow systems , the _ maximum entropy production _ ( mep ) principle @xcite .",
    "this can be specified as `` _ a flow system with many degrees of freedom , subject to fixed flows or gradients , will tend towards a steady state position of maximum production of thermodynamic entropy _ '' . since its proposition",
    ", the mep principle has been applied successfully to predict the steady states of a wide range of systems , including the earth s climate system ( oceans and atmosphere ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; thermal ( bnard ) convection @xcite ; material flow through ecological systems @xcite and biochemical processes @xcite . lying outside present - day thermodynamics , the mep principle appears to provide a unifying principle for the analysis of flow systems of all kinds .    until recently , the theoretical basis of the mep principle was unclear , limiting its acceptance . philosophically , however , the mep principle concerns reproducible behavior of a system , and therefore _ must _ be consistent with  and hence derivable from ",
    "jaynes maxent method .",
    "the first approach in this direction was undertaken by dewar @xcite , who examined a time - variant nonequilibrium system , using a maxent analysis based on the probabilities of paths in phase space .",
    "more recently , the author @xcite has given a local , conditional maxent derivation of mep , using the probabilities of instantaneous fluxes through each infinitesimal element of a flow system .",
    "the aim of this study is to explore the conceptual framework of the latter analysis in more detail .",
    "firstly , various types of physical systems are classified , to more fully understand _ how _",
    "jaynes maxent method can be applied , especially the handling of various types of constraints .",
    "several formulations of the maxent method are then discussed , with application to equilibrium , flow and source / sink systems .",
    "the analysis leads into a discussion of lagrangian multiplier constraints and the role of the potential function ( generalized free energy concept ) in maxent analysis .",
    "consider a physical system composed of discrete entities , each of which may adopt particular values of one or more physical quantities . in general , the system will be free to roam throughout its available `` category space '' . in particular cases ,",
    "however , the system will be constrained by mean values of particular physical quantities , whereupon the `` least informative '' or `` most probable '' state of the system can be inferred by jaynes maxent method .    ( 700,370 ) ( 20,0 ) ( 0,0)(c ) ( 320,0 ) ( 300,0)(d ) ( 20,190 ) ( 0,190)(a ) ( 320,190 ) ( 300,190)(b )    with some thought , many physical systems can be classified into the following scheme , as illustrated in figure 1 :    @xmath5    _ isolated systems _ ( fig .",
    "1a ) , consisting of a set of entities enclosed by some impermeable barrier , constrained by mean _ contents _",
    "@xmath6 of various physical parameters @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "if the content constraints are constant , such systems will converge towards an _ equilibrium _ position , which  as is well known  can be inferred by maxent @xcite .    _ flow systems _ ( fig .",
    "1b ) , defined by a _",
    "control volume _ ,",
    "a geometric region through which fluid(s ) may flow ( the eulerian description ) , constrained by mean _ flow rates _",
    "@xmath9 of various physical quantities @xmath7 through the system , @xmath8 . if the flow rates are constant , such systems will converge towards a _ steady state _",
    "position , which  in principle  can also be inferred by maxent @xcite .",
    "_ source / sink systems _",
    "1c ) , consisting of a set of entities enclosed by some impermeable barrier , constrained by mean _ rates of change _ @xmath10 of various physical parameters @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "such systems encompass chemical reaction kinetics , radioactive and biological growth / decay processes",
    ". if the rate constraints are constant , such systems will converge towards a _ constant growth _",
    "position , which  arguably  can also be inferred by maxent .    _ flow and reactive systems _ ( fig .",
    "1d ) , again defined by a control volume , but in this case with different incoming flow rates @xmath11 , outgoing flow rates @xmath12 and rates of production @xmath13 of various physical quantities .",
    "if the flows and rate of production of each quantity are in balance , such that a system attains a steady state flow , it should be possible to infer this position by maxent analysis .",
    "_ transient systems _ , akin to those shown in fig .",
    "1d , but in general with time - varying incoming and/or outgoing flow rates and/or rates of production within the system .",
    "in general , such systems may not be amenable to analysis by maxent , but in some special instances , they may be so amenable .",
    "several such systems are examined by dewar @xcite by a path maxent analysis , and by grandy @xcite using a quantum mechanics formulation .",
    "note that we here avoid the standard epithet `` _ non - equilibrium system _ '' , which severely lacks precision ; indeed , it is about as useful as the colour description `` non - blue '' .    how can the maxent method be applied to each above case ? after a moment s reflection , it will be apparent that in isolated systems ( fig .",
    "1a ) , the physical quantities @xmath7 within the mean constraints @xmath6",
    "are ( usually ) taken as _ extensive _ variables . by the zeroth law of thermodynamics",
    ", such properties should be uniformly distributed throughout the system at equilibrium . when applying maxent to an isolated system , we are therefore justified  in most circumstances  to analyse the system on a whole - of - system basis .",
    "this approach does not , however , apply in general , especially to the analysis of flow , source / sink and flow / reactive systems . in flow systems ( fig .",
    "1b ) , for example , although the bulk flows into and out of the control volume may be specified around the control surface , many flow patterns could exist which are consistent with such boundary conditions . for maximum rigour , it is therefore necessary  consistent with the formulation of other laws of fluid mechanics  to apply maxent to each infinitesimal element of the system .",
    "the analysis must therefore be conducted usings fluxes rather than flow rates s@xmath14 , whereas flow rates are scalars , expressed in quantities s@xmath14 . ] .",
    "similar considerations apply to source / sink , flow / reactive and transient systems , which also force the user to adopt a local rather than whole - of - system formulation of maxent .",
    "we now turn to the mathematical treatment of each case . in an _ equilibrium system _ ( fig .",
    "1a ) , we consider the joint probability @xmath15 that an entity adopts particular values @xmath16 of the physical parameters @xmath7 , @xmath17 .",
    "we therefore adopt the relative entropy : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the index of categories for the @xmath20th constraint , @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the joint prior probability . in thermodynamics ,",
    "the prior probabilities are typically handled in terms of the degeneracy @xmath23 of each category @xmath24 , where @xmath25 .",
    "is subject to the natural and moment constraints : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the mathematical expectation of @xmath16 .",
    "typical thermodynamic constraints include the mean internal energy @xmath28 , mean volume @xmath29 and mean numbers of moles @xmath30 of particles of each type @xmath31 .",
    "maximization of subject to by lagrange s method gives the inferred distribution , `` jaynes relations '' , generalized clausius equality and potential function of the system , as listed in table 1 .",
    "we can further identify the dimensionless entropy and multipliers as functions of ( historically ) known variables ; e.g.  the thermodynamic entropy is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the boltzmann constant , whilst the multipliers for the constraints @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the absolute temperature , @xmath38 is the absolute pressure and @xmath39 is the chemical potential of the @xmath31th constituent .",
    "in addition , the potential @xmath40 equates to the planck potential of the system , equivalent to the applicable free energy divided by @xmath41 @xcite . with these identifications , the relations in the left column of table 1",
    "provide the foundations of equilibrium thermodynamics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we now consider _ steady state systems _ , as illustrated in fig .",
    "1b , for which  as noted earlier ",
    "it is necessary to apply maxent to each infinitesimal element of the system .",
    "we thus consider the joint probability @xmath42 that a volume element experiences instantaneous values @xmath43 of the fluxes of various quantities @xmath7 through the element .",
    "we therefore maximize the relative entropy : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the joint prior probability .",
    "@xmath47 can be termed the _ flux entropy _ , since it expresses the spread of the distribution of instantaneous local fluxes ; it is fundamentally different to the thermodynamic entropy @xmath48 .",
    "is subject to the natural and moment constraints : @xmath49 typical constraints of interest include the mean heat flux @xmath50 , fluid flux @xmath51 , mass fluxes @xmath52 of each species @xmath31 , momentum flux ( stress tensor ) @xmath53 and/or charge flux @xmath54 .",
    "application of maxent then yields the inferred distribution and set of relations for a flow system at steady state , as listed in table 1 , where @xmath55 are the new ( vector or tensor ) lagrangian multipliers , @xmath56 is the massieu function , @xmath57 is the partition function and `` @xmath58 '' represents the vector or tensor scalar product ( as circumstances require ) .",
    "the flow system parameters listed in table 1 can be further identified as functions of known parameters .",
    "an important quantity of `` non - equilibrium thermodynamics '' is the entropy production , given for each infinitesimal element ( per unit volume ) by @xcite : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the extensive variable associated with quantity @xmath7 , whilst @xmath61 is the cartesian gradient operator . comparing with the flux entropy at steady state , @xmath62",
    ", we see that both quantities contain a sum of scalar products of fluxes with other quantities . by monotonicity arguments for each @xmath20th pair of fluxes and gradients in , making use of the fact that the fluxes are linearly independent , we can therefore identify the lagrangian multipliers as : @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are characteristic time and volume scales for the system . with these identifications , the relations on the right in table 1 provide the foundation for the maxent analysis of flow systems at steady state .",
    "_ source - sink systems _ can be analysed by maxent in a similar manner . adopting the entropy , now based on the joint probability @xmath42 of instantaneous local rates of production @xmath66 of quantities @xmath67 , subject to constraints @xmath68 and @xmath69 , one obtains relations similar to those listed in table 1 for flow systems , but expressed in terms of @xmath70 rather than @xmath71 .",
    "for chemical reaction systems , the lagrangian multipliers conjugate to @xmath70 can be identified as @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the chemical affinity of reaction @xmath67 .",
    "the local entropy production @xmath74 again emerges as an important quantity in this system .",
    "for the maxent analysis of simultaneously _ flow and reactive systems _ portrayed in fig .  1d , at steady state , it is necessary to adopt composite constraints , given by one side of the balance equation for a conserved quantity : @xmath75 this new application of maxent warrants further detailed examination .",
    "( 700,180 ) ( 40,10 ) ( 0,10)(a ) ( 320,0 ) ( 300,10)(b )    a final point is to consider the alternative formulation of each of the systems discussed in  [ sect : sys]-[sect : maxent ] , in which the system is constrained  not by mean values of physical variables  but by their conjugate lagrangian multipliers .",
    "two examples are shown in figure 2 :    @xmath5    _ open equilibrium systems _ ( fig .",
    "2a ) , in which the equilibrium position is imposed by a surrounding bath of fixed intensive variables ; and    _ gradient - constrained flow systems _ ( fig .",
    "2b ) , in which a steady state flow system is produced by the imposition of fixed gradients of intensive variables .    irrespective of whether a set of physical quantities or their conjugate multipliers are adopted as constraints ,",
    "the mathematical method for the analysis of each pair of systems is the same .",
    "this point was in fact appreciated by jaynes @xcite , but his discussion is rather oblique .",
    "in addition to those shown in figure 2 , other multiplier - constrained systems are possible . _ hybrid equilibrium - steady state systems _ must also be considered , by the imposition of fixed intensive variables of certain quantities , and gradients of other quantities ; indeed , all combustion processes in the earth s atmosphere may be conceptualized in this manner .    since the work of gibbs @xcite",
    ", it has been standard practice in thermodynamics to use the free energy @xmath76 as the criterion for analysis of open equilibrium systems , wherein @xmath76 attains a minimum at equilibrium . from a jaynesian perspective",
    ", the free energy divided by @xmath41 is equivalent to the negative massieu function or",
    "_ potential function _ of a system : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the entropy of the rest of the universe .",
    "the potential @xmath40 embodies the second law of thermodynamics , in the sense that spontaneous changes must take place by an interplay between changes in entropy within the system , @xmath79 , and changes in entropy outside the system , @xmath80 , such that @xmath81 @xcite .    in a similar vein",
    ", it is possible to adopt the potential function @xmath82 as the criterion for analysis of gradient - controlled flow systems . by a flow analog of the second law",
    ", @xmath82 will also attain a minimum at steady state . from its definition in table 1 , , and the identification @xmath83 , the potential can be written : @xmath84 conditional on the assumption that @xmath85 , we see that the minimum in @xmath82 will correspond to a state of maximum entropy production @xmath86 .",
    "the analysis therefore provides a local derivation of the mep principle , conditional on a single assumption concerning the behavior of the flux entropy @xmath47 .",
    "this study examines several kinds of physical system , including equilibrium , steady state flow , source / sink and flow / reactive systems . in these cases",
    ", it is shown that the `` stationary '' or `` constant '' position of the system can be inferred by jaynes maxent , with the appropriate choice of relative entropy function and constraints . for equilibrium , flow and source / sink systems , constrained respectively by extensive variable contents , fluxes or rates of production , the lagrangian multipliers can be identified respectively as functions of the intensive variables , gradients in the extensive variables or chemical affinity terms . in all cases ,",
    "changes in the potential function ( negative massieu function ) can be used as a criterion for stationarity , expressing the interplay between an increase in entropy ( however defined ) of a system , and an increase in entropy outside the system . for flow and source / sink systems , the minimum potential corresponds ( conditionally ) to a state of maximum entropy production .",
