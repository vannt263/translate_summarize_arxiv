    "in computational studies of crystallization from the undercooled liquid one needs to be able to distinguish particles that are part of the crystal from those that belong to the liquid .",
    "ideally , such an assignment should be based on the local environment of the particles only .",
    "one method to do that , which is independent of the specific crystal structure and does not require the definition of a reference frame , is provided by the following algorithm based on spherical harmonics @xcite .",
    "first , the complex vector @xmath0 of particle @xmath1 is defined as @xcite @xmath2 here , @xmath3 is the number of nearest neighbors of particle @xmath1 , @xmath4 is a free integer parameter and @xmath5 is an integer that runs from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "the functions @xmath8 are the spherical harmonics and @xmath9 is the vector from particle @xmath1 to particle @xmath10 . using the set of complex vectors @xmath11 one can then define the scalar product @xmath12 which measures the correlation between the structures surrounding particles @xmath1 and @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath13 indicates complex conjugation .",
    "two particles @xmath1 and @xmath10 are defined to be _ connected _ if @xmath14 is larger than a given value , typically @xmath15 .",
    "a particle is solid - like if the number of connections it has with its neighbors is above a certain threshold , typically between @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "if a particle is connected to less particles , it is considered to be liquid - like . using this criterion to distinguish solid - like from liquid - like particles one",
    "can then search for clusters of connected solid - like particles .",
    "the size of the largest of these crystalline clusters @xmath18 is often used as a reaction coordinate to follow the progress of the crystallization process .",
    "provided that this reaction coordinate captures the essential physics of the crystal nucleation , the gibbs free energy @xmath19 calculated as a function of @xmath18 provides a means to estimate the rate at which the nucleation of the crystalline phase occurs .",
    "this procedure very efficiently distinguishes between solid - like and liquid - like particles , but does not discriminate between different crystal structures .",
    "a set of parameters which hold the information of the local structure are the local bond order parameters , or steinhardt order parameters , defined as @xcite @xmath20 depending on the choice of @xmath4 , these parameters are sensitive to different crystal symmetries .",
    "each of them depends on the angles between the vectors to the neighboring particles only and therefore these parameters are independent of a reference frame .",
    "different approaches based on these local bond order parameters were developed to analyze the structure of the crystalline nucleus during the freezing event .",
    "especially @xmath21 and @xmath22 are often used as they are a good choice to distinguish between cubic and hexagonal structures @xcite .    in practice ,",
    "local bond order parameters are used in different ways .",
    "frenkel and coworkers @xcite analyzed the structure of crystalline clusters in terms of order parameter distributions . to do that , they first computed the distributions of @xmath21 and @xmath22 for the liquid and for perfect fcc and bcc crystals .",
    "due to thermal fluctuations , these distributions can be rather broad . then , they determined the distributions of the same order parameters in the crystalline cluster .",
    "these distributions are represented as a superposition of the distribution functions of the perfect phases .",
    "the superposition coefficients @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , determinded by mean square minimization , then yield information on the composition of the cluster .",
    "for instance , @xmath26 , @xmath27,and @xmath28 would be indicative of a cluster that is half in the fcc structure and half in the bcc structure .",
    "another bond order parameter method , used for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite , defines regions in the two dimensional @xmath21-@xmath22-plane and @xmath21-@xmath29-plane .",
    "the crystalline structure around a given particle is characterized by its positions in these planes .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 necessary for that analysis is defined as @xmath31 here , the integers @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 run from @xmath35 to @xmath36 , but only combinations with @xmath37 are allowed .",
    "the term in brackets is the wigner 3-@xmath10 symbol @xcite . using this approach",
    ", one can determine the type of crystalline structure occurring around each individual particle .",
    "as mentioned above , thermal fluctuations smear out the order parameter distributions such that it may be difficult to distinguish local crystalline structures based on steinhardt bond order parameters . in the following we present a simple method to increase the accuracy of the crystal structure determination by averaging over the bond order parameters of nearest neighbor particles .",
    "this averaging procedure is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : averaging ] and validated for two different soft sphere systems in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "some conclusions are provided in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the crystal structure determination described above can be improved by using the following averaged form of the local bond order parameters : @xmath38 where @xmath39 here , the sum from @xmath40 to @xmath41 runs over all neighbors of particle @xmath1 plus the particle @xmath1 itself .",
    "thus , to calculate @xmath42 of particle @xmath1 one uses the local orientational order vectors @xmath0 averaged over particle @xmath1 and its surroundings . while @xmath43 holds the information of the structure of the first shell around particle @xmath1 , its averaged version @xmath42 also takes into account the second shell .",
    "one might say that using the parameter @xmath44 instead of @xmath45 increases the accuracy of the distinction of different structures at the price of a coarsening of the spacial resolution . in this sense , the averaged local bond order parameter is similar to the scalar product of eq .",
    "( [ equ : scalarproduct ] ) used to decide whether a particle is in a solid - like or liquid - like environment .",
    "also in that case the second particle shell is effectively taken into account .",
    "+ the averaged orientational order parameter @xmath46 can also be used to define an averaged version @xmath47 of the order parameter @xmath30 , @xmath48",
    "in the following , we verify that these averaged forms of the bond order parameters indeed increase the accuracy of the crystal structure determination . the calculations are done for two distinct systems : one in which the particles interact via a lennard - jones potential and one in which the interaction is of the gaussian core form @xcite .      for the calculations of the lennard - jones system @xcite the temperature was @xmath49 and the pressure was @xmath50 , corresponding to 20% undercooling of the liquid phase @xcite .",
    "the same conditions were used in ref .",
    "@xcite to study homogeneous crystal nucleation .",
    "this phase point corresponds to a mean density of @xmath51 in the fcc crystal , which is the most stable phase under these conditions .",
    "all simulations were carried out in the isobaric - isothermal ensemble , but calculations at constant volume for the corresponding densities yielded essentially identical results .",
    "the particle number was @xmath52 in the bcc crystal , @xmath53 in the fcc crystal , and @xmath54 in the hcp crystal and in the undercooled liquid .",

    "the overlap between the distributions decreases considerably thus allowing one to distinguish between different structures more precisely . as can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig : qhistolj ] , the reduced overlap is due not only to a narrowing of the distributions but also to a shift of the means towards smaller values . while one would expect the order parameter distributions to narrow on the basis of the central limit theorem , one is tempted to attribute the shift of the means to local correlations . to test this speculation ,",
    "we have artificially eliminated correlations by computing @xmath44 from uncorrelated values of @xmath58 generated with the appropriate statistics . also in this case the narrowing of the distributions was accompanied by a shift of the means indicating that this shift is not due to local correlations between the local order parameters of nearest neighbors but rather originates in the functional form of @xmath44 .",

    "the averaged bond order parameters proposed in this paper separate different crystal structures more accurately than regular bond order parameters . instead of using the first shell of surrounding particles only , this method also takes into account the second shell , just as one usually does when distinguishing between solid - like and liquid - like particles ( see eq .",
    "( [ equ : scalarproduct ] ) ) . due to the averaging procedure , the overlap between the order parameter distributions belonging to different phases decreases by up to a few orders of magnitude . the sharper distinction between the different phases",
    "is obtained at the cost of a slightly reduced spatial resolution .",
    "we demonstrated the enhancement in the crystal structure determination for two systems of soft particles interacting via a lennard - jones potential and a gaussian core potential .",
