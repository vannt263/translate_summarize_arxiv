    ", the `` recycling '' model was proposed by @xcite and @xcite to explain how msps acquire such high rotation velocity : they were previously spun up by accretion through roche lobe overflow of their companions in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) as the orbit shrinks due to magnetic braking and/or gravitational radiation .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the preponderance of msps in binary systems , and it also explains the fact that they have much weaker magnetic fields than ordinary pulsars , since accretion can dissipate and bury magnetic field @xcite .",
    "an interesting subclass of msps are the eclipsing radio msps , the so - called `` black widows '' and `` redbacks . ''",
    "approximately 53 such systems are known from large - scale radio surveys , deep searches of globular clusters , and most recently , radio follow - ups of unidentified _ fermi _ @xmath7-ray sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "more multi - wavelength observations and physical understanding of pulsar wind interaction with stellar material are needed to resolve these issues .",
    "recently , transitions from accretion mode to radio msps have been found in several redback systems ( psr j1023 + 0038 , psr j1824@xmath22452i , and xss j12270@xmath24859 ) that decline in x - ray luminosity and exhibit millisecond radio pulsations @xcite .",

    "with multi - wavelength monitoring , we expect to see more transitions between accretion- and rotation - powered states .",
    "black widows and redbacks are ideal systems to measure ns mass , since the orbital radial velocity of pulsar and companion can be measured separately through radio and optical doppler shifts , respectively , and light - curve modelling can constrain the inclination angle of the orbit .",

    "are psrs j1023 + 0038 @xcite , j2215 + 5135 @xcite , j2339@xmath20533 @xcite , and xss  j12270@xmath24859 @xcite .",
    "ones without a dominant heating effect are psrs j1723@xmath22837 @xcite , j1816 + 4510 @xcite , and j2129@xmath20428 @xcite .",
    "this disparity can be understood in terms of the balance of a number of competing factors , including the intrinsic luminosity of the companion , the mass ratio and orbital separation , and the spin - down luminosity of the pulsar .",
    "we have seen some evidence that psr j1628@xmath23205  is an intermediate case , showing mainly ellipsoidal modulation , but possibly some heating .",
    "here we make a back - of - the - envelope calculation to evaluate whether we should expect pulsar heating to make an observable contribution to the optical luminosity of psr j1628@xmath23205 .",
    "the representative model from section  [ f : model ] has a luminosity @xmath108 erg  s@xmath12 , where @xmath109  cm , the radius of the roche lobe according to @xcite .",
    "this value of luminosity is also obtained by direct summation over the surface of the model star .",
    "the contribution of pulsar irradiation @xmath110 to the optical luminosity can be expressed in terms of the heating efficiency @xmath111 of an assumed isotropic pulsar wind as @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the orbital separation , and @xmath114 erg  s@xmath12 .",
    "this is an upper limit because of the unknown contribution of the kinematic period derivative , @xmath115 , where @xmath116  ms . assuming the tangential velocity @xmath117  km  s@xmath12 estimated in section  [ f : obs1 ] , @xmath118 , which is 27% of the observed value , reducing @xmath119 by the same percentage .",
    "for the representative model @xmath120 , @xmath121 erg  s@xmath12 , and pulsar heating is comparable to the observed luminosity @xmath122 only if the efficiency of the process is of order unity , which is not likely for a number of reasons .",
    "first , the heating may be mediated by an intrabinary shock between the pulsar wind and the wind from the companion , which could radiate in all directions .",
    "second , for stars with deep convective envelopes , as should be the case here @xcite , the effective efficiency of re - radiation is @xmath123 @xcite .",
    "third , some of the energy absorbed goes into the ablated stellar wind .",
    "due to uncertainties in the efficiencies of these processes , the true luminosity and beaming of the pulsar wind , and the distance , we can not conclude whether heating should be observed in psr j1628@xmath23205 .",
    "@xcite estimated an efficiency in the range @xmath124 for the four systems they studied .",
    "for the nominal distance , the phenomena seen in the light curve of psr j1628@xmath23205  that are _ not _ explained by ellipsoidal deformation could be effects of heating with @xmath111 in this range .",
    "the residual asymmetries may be caused indirectly by the material ablated from the companion .",
    "if a wind flows off the companion in a cometary tail that lags the orbital motion , then it is possible that the intrabinary shock is displaced toward the trailing side of the companion .",
    "a clear example of asymmetric heating can be seen in the orbital light curve of psr j1023 + 0038 , in which the maximum occurs before phase 0.75 . both in optical and in x - rays @xcite , the trailing side of the companion is brighter than the leading side .",
    "alternatively , a large starspot could produce an asymmetric temperature distribution . since a starspot",
    "would also be associated with magnetic field intrinsic to the companion , it is also possible that such a magnetic field could channel the pulsar wind and cause enhanced local heating , as was speculated by @xcite to explain an apparent hot patch on the companion of psr j1544 + 4937 . for an intrinsic large - scale magnetic field to channel the pulsar wind",
    ", it must have a pressure at @xmath125 stellar radius above the surface of the companion at least comparable to the pressure of the relativistic pulsar wind , i.e. , @xmath126 .",
    "for the representative model , this corresponds to @xmath127  g , a not unreasonable value .",
    "a similar calculation of the efficiency of pulsar heating can be made for the peak optical luminosity of psr j1301 + 0833  at orbital phase 0.75 .",
    "assuming @xmath128 , and a dm distance of @xmath129  kpc , we correct the observed @xmath0 for @xmath130 . converting to flux density using @xmath131 erg  @xmath70  s@xmath12  @xmath12 @xcite ,",
    "the flux density at @xmath132    is @xmath133 erg  @xmath70  s@xmath12  @xmath12 .",
    "if half of the star is illuminated by the pulsar wind and is re - radiating , its luminosity is @xmath134 erg  s@xmath12 if @xmath135  k , or @xmath136 erg  s@xmath12 if @xmath137  k. for @xmath138 , we have @xmath139 , and @xmath140 . if the companion fills its roche lobe , then @xmath141 erg  s@xmath12 .",
    "black widow pulsars do not necessarily fill their roche lobes , but there is room for this one to underfill by a large factor and still shine by reprocessed pulsar irradiation even if the efficiency for that process is @xmath142 .",
    "we have discovered the optical companions of two _ fermi _ millisecond pulsars and confirmed the identifications based on their orbital photometric variability .",
    "our @xmath20-band light curve of psr j1301 + 0833  displays an amplitude of at least 2.4 mag , with a maximum at superior conjunction of the companion .",
    "psr j1301 + 0833  appears to be a classic black widow system .",
    "its companion is a faint , probably sub - stellar object around an msp of high @xmath119 , which explains why its light is dominated by pulsar heating .",
    "the efficiency of this process is required to be only @xmath142 .",
    "deeper optical observations and multicolor light curves are needed before this system can be modelled , because we have not detected the unheated side of the secondary .",
    "so we do not know its effective temperature or roche - lobe filling factor .",
    "the optical modulation of psr j1628@xmath23205  is very different .",
    "it is characterized by two peaks and two troughs per orbit , whose phase relationship to the pulsar ephemeris clearly establishes that ellipsoidal distortion is the cause of the variation .",
    "the amplitude of modulation is consistent with a near roche - lobe filling secondary star in a high - inclination orbit , which we conservatively estimate as @xmath4 .",
    "this limits the mass of the secondary to @xmath5 .",
    "it is less dense than a main - sequence star of the same mass .",
    "it is not yet possible to derive system parameters more precisely for psr j1628@xmath23205  because its light curve also displays distortions that are not characteristic of ellipsoidal variations .",
    "an order - of - magnitude estimate for possible pulsar heating in this system justifies why this process does not make a major contribution to the radiation from the photosphere , because it would require an efficiency of order 1 .",
    "but in addition , it is difficult to to improve the fit to the light curve with even a small amount of isotropic heating from the pulsar . instead off - center heating is required , or else an intrinsic , asymmetric surface - temperature distribution .",
    "we used distance constraints from the pulsar dm to limit the effective temperature of the comparison star of psr j1628@xmath23205  to @xmath6  k. it should have the optical spectrum of a late k star .",
    "multicolor photometry and spectra are needed to further investigate the cause of the distortions in the light curve and pin down the system parameters , including the mass of the ns .",
    "evidence for an overall increase in brightness of @xmath143  mag between 2013 and 2014 is present in our observations .",
    "this raises the possibility that we are seeing an increase in the photospheric temperature or roche - lobe filling factor that may eventually cause sufficient roche - lobe overflow to form a partial accretion disk and shut off the radio pulsar mechanism , as has been observed recently in several similar redback systems .",
