    "in this paper we consider the anisotropic curvature motion for planar immersed curves .",
    "more precisely , given an initial curve @xmath1 and a norm @xmath0 on @xmath2 , which we call _ anisotropy _ , we show existence of a family @xmath3 of curves satisfying the evolution equation @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the normal component of the velocity @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the euclidean normal vector to the support of @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the dual norm of @xmath0 , and @xmath10 denotes the anisotropic curvature ( see section [ sec1 ] ) . in particular , we prove a short time existence result which holds for any anisotropy @xmath0 , under a natural regularity assumption on the initial datum .    after the seminal paper by brakke @xcite ,",
    "the isotropic mean curvature flow has been intensively studied in the past years ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) and the long - time behavior of the flow as well as its singularities are relatively well - understood .    the first occurrence of anisotropic curvature flow appeared in @xcite , where the author shows a short time existence result in two dimensions , for smooth and strictly convex anisotropies .",
    "a few years later , in @xcite it was shown that , at the maximal existence time the evolving curve either looses a self - intersection or shrinks to a point . in particular ,",
    "if the initial curve is embedded , then it stays embedded , eventually becomes convex and then shrinks to homothetically a point ( see @xcite ) .    in the crystalline case , that is , when the anisotropy @xmath0 is piecewise linear , equation reduces to a system of ode s and existence and uniqueness of solutions was proved in @xcite . shortly after , in @xcite , stancu proved that a convex curve remains convex and shrinks homothetically to a point ,",
    "while its shape approaches the boundary of the unit ball of @xmath0 , and in @xcite the authors showed that an embedded initial curve becomes eventually convex and then shrinks to a point by the result in @xcite ( for a classification of the asymptotic behaviour of a polygonal curve when the time approaches the shrinking time see also @xcite ) .    on the other hand few results are available for general anisotropies . in the embedded case ,",
    "an existence result analogous to the one in @xcite was established in @xcite , by means of an implicit variational scheme introduced in @xcite in order to define a global weak solution to the anisotropic mean curvature flow .",
    "the consistency of such solution with the solution constructed in @xcite was shown in @xcite .",
    "an important notion in @xcite is that of @xmath0-regular flow ( see @xcite and definition [ defflow ] below ) , which extends the notion of smooth evolution to general anisotropies . for",
    "such flows a uniqueness result was established in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "let us mention that very recently an existence and uniqueness result of global weak solutions to the anisotropic mean curvature flow in the embedded case , which holds in any dimensions and for general anisotropies , has been proved in @xcite ( see also @xcite for a similar result in the crystalline case , in two and three dimensions ) .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to extend the existence result in @xcite to immersed curves . in order to do this",
    ", we regularize both the anisotropy and the initial curve , so that we can apply the result in @xcite and obtain a smooth solution for short time .",
    "then , we show that we can pass to the limit in the regularization parameter , to obtain an existence result in the general case .",
    "we point out that , since the result in @xcite only applies to embedded solutions , at the moment we do not have a general uniqueness result .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : in section [ sec1 ] , we introduce the notation which we use in the paper and define the anisotropic curvature flow for immersed curves . in section [ sec3 ] , we show that a curve with bounded @xmath0-curvature can be approximated by curves with bounded @xmath11-curvature , where @xmath11 s are smooth anisotropies converging to @xmath0 as @xmath12 . in section [ asecsmooth ] , we study the evolution of relevant geometric quantities under the flow , and prove that the curvature must blow up at the first singular time , as it happens in the isotropic case .",
    "this provides a uniform bound of the existence time of the approximate flows .",
    "finally , in section [ secgen ] we pass to the limit in the approximate flows and obtain a solution to the original anisotropic curvature motion in an interval @xmath13 where @xmath14 depends only on the initial data .",
    "we consider closed planar curves parametrized by @xmath15 \\to { \\mathbb r}^2 $ ] , where @xmath16 is identified in the obvious way with @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "we denote by @xmath18 the arc - length parameter of the curve ( thus @xmath19 ) , by @xmath20 its unit tangent and @xmath21 its unit normal . the euclidean scalar product in @xmath2 is denoted by @xmath22 .",
