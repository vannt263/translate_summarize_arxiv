    "the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy is not only important for nuclear physics , but also crucial for many astrophysical processes , such as the structure of neutron stars and the dynamical evolution of proto - neutron stars @xcite .",
    "heavy - ion reactions induced by neutron - rich nuclei , especially radioactive beams , provide a unique opportunity to constrain the equation of state ( eos ) of asymmetric nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "though considerable progress has been made recently in determining the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy around the normal nuclear matter density from studying the isospin diffusion in heavy - ion reactions at intermediate energies @xcite , much more work is still needed to probe the high - density behavior of the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "a key task is to identify experimental observables sensitive to the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy , especially at high densities .",
    "several potentially useful observables , such as , the free neutron / proton ratio @xcite , the isospin fractionation serot , ba97b , vb98,hs00,wp01,vb02 , the neutron - proton correlation function @xcite , @xmath2/@xmath3he @xcite , the isospin diffusion @xcite , the proton differential elliptic flow @xcite and the @xmath4 ratio @xcite have been proposed in the literature .",
    "the concept of the neutron - proton differential flow was first introduced by one of us @xcite several years ago .",
    "it was argued that the neutron - proton differential flow minimizes influences of the isoscalar potential but maximizes effects of the symmetry potential .",
    "it can also reduce effects of other dynamical ingredients in intermediate energy heavy - ion reactions .",
    "it is therefore among the most promising probes for the high density behavior of the nuclear symmetry energy .    in order to extract accurately information about",

    "moreover , the long range coulomb force on charged particles may play an important role in these observables .",
    "if at all possible , one would like to disentangle effects of the symmetry energy from those due to the coulomb force .",
    "very often , this is impossible . one",
    "would thus like to construct observables that can reduce the coulomb effects as much as possible .",
    "ratios and/or differences of two observables from a pair of reactions using different isotopes of the same element are among the promising candidates to reduce both the systematic errors and the coulomb effects .",
    "whether to use the ratio or the difference to construct the desired observable depends on the nature of the observables involved . for the neutron / proton ratio of pre - equilibrium nucleons and the @xmath5 ratio , for instance , it is natural to construct their double ratios as was recently done in refs.@xcite .",
    "however , the neutron - proton differential flow is additive , it is more useful to construct the double differences instead of ratios . in the present work ,",
    "we investigate the double neutron - proton differential transverse flow from the two reactions of @xmath6sn+@xmath7sn and @xmath8sn+@xmath8sn at beam energies of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mev / nucleon .",
    "it is found to have the same sensitivity to the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy as the single neutron - proton differential flow in the neutron - rich reaction system @xmath6sn+@xmath7sn . besides having smaller systematic errors , the double differential flow is shown indeed to reduce significantly the coulomb effects .",

    "normally , the coulomb potential dominates over the symmetry potential for protons , consequently protons have higher average transverse momenta than neutrons , leading to the negative ( positive ) values of the @xmath41 at forward ( backward ) rapidities .",
