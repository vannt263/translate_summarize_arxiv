    "for @xmath151 g the proton effective mass no more decreases monotonically but tends to reach certain situation at high density .",
    "a similar situation is exhibited for the neutron effective mass as shown in fig .",
    "at ultra high magnetic field the @xmath152 becomes larger than the field - free case while for lower b they are indistinguishable .",
    "this is mainly caused by the effects of amm terms on the @xmath16-field . in figure 7",
    "one can see that the scalar field is increased at large field , especially for high densities .",
    "the changes on the @xmath0- and @xmath18-field are negligible for with and without amm terms .",

    "alternately , a stiffer pressure is displayed compared to the case without amm terms .",
    "it should be mentionable that the eos is only for matter , the magnetic energy itself has not yet been added .",
    "we can conclude from above that at ultrastrong magnetic fields(@xmath2 g ) the proton effective masse and neutron effective mass all become larger by including of amm terms . and",
    "the effective masse of neutron is bigger than that of proton effective masses at lower densities ( @xmath153 ) , since in this regions the density of protons is larger than that of neutrons .",
    "the eos becomes much stiffer at @xmath154 g because of the effect of amm terms .",
    "the nucleon effective mass and eos of this system have no evident change under magnetic fields of @xmath142 g .",
    "the amm terms play an important role only under very strong magnetic field of @xmath144 g .",

    "it is generally believed that the high - order terms stemming from the vacuum polarization of electrons in an external magnetic field @xcite may get into work near the critical point and cancel the electron amm term .",

    "9(a ) and ( b ) show the nucleon effective masses as functions of baryon densities .",
    "the pressure as functions of baryon densities and energy densities are show in fig .",
