    "in the last decade , the confirmation of neutrino flavor oscillations at atmospheric , solar , reactor and accelerator neutrino sources @xcite and the reported observation of neutrinoless double beta @xmath7 decay @xcite have together played a great inspirational role in the advancement of a vast amount of experimental as well as theoretical studies on nuclear double-@xmath0 decay in general and @xmath7 decay in particular @xcite . the former has provided information on the neutrino mass square differences @xmath8m@xmath9 and @xmath8m@xmath10 , mixing angles @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 and possible hierarchies in the neutrino mass spectrum @xcite .",
    "in addition to hinting on the majorana nature of neutrinos , the latter has also ascertained the role of various mechanism in different gauge theoretical models @xcite .",
    "presently , a number of projects for observing the @xmath14 decay of @xmath15ca ( candles ) , @xmath16ge ( gerda , majorana ) , @xmath17se ( supernemo , lucifer),@xmath18mo ( moon , amore ) , @xmath19cd ( cobra ) , @xmath20te ( cuore ) , @xmath21xe ( xmass , exo , kamland - zen , next ) , @xmath6nd ( sno++ , supernemo , dcba / mtd ) @xcite have been designed and hopefully , the reported observation of @xmath7 decay @xcite would be confirmed in the near future .    in the left - right symmetric model @xcite",
    ", the three possible mechanisms of @xmath22 decay are the exchange of left handed light as well as heavy majorana neutrinos and the exchange of right handed heavy majorana neutrinos . alternatively , the occurrence of lepton number violating majoron accompanied @xmath7 decay is also a possibility .",
    "based on the most recent experimental evidences @xcite , regarding the observability of all the nine majoron models @xcite , it has been concluded that the study of classical majoron models is the most preferred one .    in the short base line experiments @xcite , the indication of @xmath23 conversion",
    "was explained with @xmath24 ev@xmath25 ev and @xmath26 .",
    "new results of the reactor fluxes favor short base line oscillation @xcite .",

    "the necessity for the inclusion of nuclear deformation has resulted in the employment of deformed qrpa @xcite , projected - hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( phfb ) @xcite , pseudo - su(3 ) @xcite , ibm @xcite and energy density functional ( edf ) @xcite approaches in the calculation of ntmes . additionally , there are many a possibilities for the inclusion of the model dependent form factors for the finite size of nucleons ( fns ) , short range correlations ( src ) @xcite , and the value of axial vector current coupling constant @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "each model has a different truncation scheme for the unmanageable hilbert space , and employs a variety of residual interactions , resulting in ntmes @xmath36 , which are of the same order of magnitude but not identical .    in the analysis of uncertainties in ntmes for @xmath37 decay ,",
    "the spread between the available calculated results @xcite was translated in to an average of all the available ntmes , and the standard deviation was treated as the measure of the theoretical uncertainty @xcite .",
    "bilenky and grifols @xcite have suggested that the possible observation of @xmath38 decay in several nuclei could be employed to check the calculated ntmes in a model independent way by comparing the ratios of the ntmes - squared with the ratios of observed half - lives @xmath39 .",
