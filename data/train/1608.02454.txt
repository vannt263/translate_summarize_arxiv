    "since the discovery of accelerated expansion of universe , there have been numerous efforts on theoretical and observational grounds to explain cause of the cosmic acceleration . the most popular theoretical model , which explains the cosmic acceleration and fits well to the currently available observational data , is the standard @xmath0cdm ( cosmological constant @xmath0 + cold dark matter ) model @xcite . in this model",
    ", @xmath0 is a candidate of dark energy ( de ) which is believed to be responsible for the current accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "this model , however , suffers from some theoretical problems @xcite , which motivated the researchers to propose new models of de .",
    "one such problem is the coincidence problem which refers to the fact that there is no explanation for the same order of the energy densities of dark matter ( dm ) and vacuum energy today . to alleviate the coincidence problem ,",
    "the interaction between dm and de components of the universe has been proposed / studied in the literature ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "the interaction in the dark sector is quite appealing since dm and de are the dominant components in the overall energy budget of the universe .",
    "moreover , it has recently been shown that the current observational data can favor the late - time interaction between dm and de @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we shall study a cosmological scenario where dm and de are not conserved separately rather allowed to interact via a free coupling parameter .",
    "+ the physics of neutrinos has important implications on the formation of the large - scale structure , big bang nucleosynthesis , cosmic microwave background , and in other cosmological information sources ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "the sum of the active neutrino masses ( @xmath1 ) as well as the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom ( @xmath2 ) , are still the unknown quantities , and these have received the attention of researchers in different cosmological contexts lately . within the framework of @xmath0cdm model , planck collaboration @xcite has measured @xmath3 ev and @xmath4 at 2@xmath5 confidence level .",
    "an extension of @xmath0cdm model has provided @xmath6 ev @xcite .",
    "constraints on these parameters have also been performed in @xmath7 gravity @xcite , holographic de @xcite , parametric dynamical de models @xcite , scalar field de @xcite , and in other pioneer works @xcite .",
    "estimates for mass of neutrinos have been carried out in other contexts as well such as the solar and atmospheric experiments @xcite , and from the reactor neutrino oscillation anomalies @xcite .",
    "+   + given the motivation and the recent indication in favor of an interaction in dark sector , probing the interacting scenario in the dark sector with massive neutrinos would be useful to explore new perspectives in this direction .",
    "therefore , the aim of this paper is to investigate the constraints on @xmath1 in a cosmological scenario , where dm and de are allowed to interact via a free coupling parameter , by using the latest observational data . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly review the coupled dm and de scenario in the presence of the massive neutrinos . in section iii ,",
    "we present the data sets used and the statistical results .",
    "we summarize findings of the study in the final section .",
    "we consider a spatially - flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe , and assume that dm and de are not conserved separately .",
    "the energy conservation law for the interacting dm - de components reads as @xmath8 leading to @xmath9    the friedmann equation can be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the hubble parameter with an over dot denoting derivative with respect to the cosmic time .",
    "further @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 stand for the energy densities of photons , neutrinos , baryons , cold dm and de , respectively .",
    "+ let us consider that the dm particles can undergo dilution throughout the cosmic history with a small deviation from the standard evolution characterized by a constant @xmath17 as follows    @xmath18    and consider that the de is described by an equation of state parameter @xmath19 , being @xmath20 featuring a quintessence field , and @xmath21 a phantom field . from the eq .",
    "( [ dotrho ] ) and ( [ rho0a3 ] ) we find @xmath22.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the parameter @xmath17 is the coupling constant that characterizes the interaction between dm and de , and @xmath23 implies the absence of interaction while @xmath24 corresponds to the energy transfer from dm to de .",
    "hence , the parameter @xmath17 quantifies the deviation from non - interacting case , without the need of considering a specific interaction term between dm and de .",
    "the above scenario was originally introduced in @xcite .",
    "later , it was generalized and analyzed with observational data in @xcite .",
    "+ we consider the scalar linear perturbations in the present work as described in @xcite ( and references cited therein ) . here",
    "let us briefly describe the cosmological evolution of the massive neutrinos .",
    "assuming that the neutrinos decoupling in the early universe occurs instantly , the zeroth - order distribution function for massive neutrinos is given by the fermi - dirac distribution ,    @xmath25^{-1 } , \\label{nu_distro}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , are the temperature and scale factor at the neutrino decoupling epoch and , @xmath28 is the co - moving momentum .",
    "the factor @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the neutrino mass and number of spin degrees of freedom while @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the planck and the boltzmann constants , respectively .",
    "+ the unperturbed energy density is given by    @xmath33    where @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is given by eq .",
    "( [ nu_distro ] ) .",
    "the distribution comprising of a zeroth - order distribution plus a perturbation can be described by @xmath36 .",
    "thus , the perturbed energy density in fourier space reads as @xcite    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the perturbation in @xmath39 . the full boltzmann equation that gives the evolution of @xmath38 ,",
    "is described in @xcite .",
    "+ in the next section , we discuss the observational constraints on the free parameters of the model under consideration in the presence of massive neutrinos . on the basis of neutrino masses , we consider the following two models . + * model i*. a model with three active neutrinos subject to the condition that @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "it is the case , normally considered in the literature to investigate the effects of @xmath1 on a particular cosmological scenario .",
    "the base parameters set for the model i is    @xmath41    * model ii*. a model with three massive neutrinos ( @xmath42 , with @xmath43 1,2,3 ) in addition to a non - standard effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath44 ( interpreted as a dark radiation ) that can affect the cmb in several forms @xcite .",
    "the base parameters set for the model ii is    @xmath45    one may notice that the above two models carry free parameters in addition to the six parameters @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 of the @xmath0cdm cosmology .",
    "therefore , these models are simple extensions of the standard @xmath0cdm model .",
    "in what follows , first we briefly describe the observational data sets used to constrain the parameters of the models under consideration .",
