    "the first was in the unpublished thesis @xcite , and was proved by establishing a bijection with skew young tableaux ; see also the appendix to @xcite .",

    "two honeycombs are displayed in figure [ fig : honeyex ] .    since any vertex of a honeycomb satisfies this `` zero - tension '' condition , the honeycomb as a whole does so ( by a sort of green s theorem ) , so the number of edges ( counted with multiplicity ) emanating in the northwest , northeast , or south directions must be the same number @xmath4 .",
    "we call this the * * size of the honeycomb .    from a hive of size",

    "there is one honeycomb edge for each unit edge connecting two vertices in @xmath14 , but perpendicular to it ( living in the dual graph ) .",

    "the vertices of the honeycomb then correspond to the linear regions in the hive .",
    "the rhombus inequalities on the hive , reinterpreted , state that the edges of the honeycomb are of nonnegative length .",
    "it is quite tricky to prove that this map from hives to honeycombs is in fact a bijection ( theorem 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "we are now in a position to describe `` honeycomb scattering '' , a honeycomb interpretation of the tetrahedron - evacuation bijection from section [ sec : assoc ] .",
    "this was the form in which one of us ( cw ) first found this proof of associativity .",

    "now pull the lower honeycomb @xmath168 upwards , while sending the upper one downwards , at the same constant speed ( this interpretation involves a time coordinate ) . at some point",
    "a vertex of @xmath168 will collide with one of @xmath26 .",
    "we give an example of the whole process in figure [ fig : scatterex ] , and ( before they are given below ) we invite the reader to guess the general rules defining scattering .",
    "the rules for scattering are as follows .",
    "each vertex in @xmath26 ( respectively , @xmath168 ) is given an initial velocity of down ( respectively , up ) .",
    "all vertices move until there is a collision .",
    "generically , the first sort of collision met is that of a single edge contracting ( as in ( 1 - 2 ) , ( 3 - 4 ) , ( 7 - 8 ) , ( 10 - 11 ) of figure [ fig : scatterex ] ) .",
    "when this happens , we redirect the vertically colliding particles to move left and right , conserving total energy and momentum .",
    "note that what used to be a vertical line connecting them is now horizontal .    after some of these collisions , a second type of collision is possible , involving two pairs of converging vertices making a rectangle collapse ( as in ( 5 - 6 ) of figure [ fig : scatterex ] ) .",
    "these are again redirected out , conserving energy and momentum .",
    "( for generic @xmath26 and @xmath168 , these two are the only sorts of collisions that can happen during the whole scattering .",
    "nongeneric @xmath173 can be understood by taking limits from the generic case , so we wo nt dwell on them . )",
    "it is true at the beginning , and remains true after either type of collision , that if a vertex is attached to a vertical line then it is moving vertically and will eventually get into a 2-vertex collision .",
    "note that each 2-vertex collision increases the number of particles moving horizontally and decreases the number of vertical edges , and each 4-vertex collision decreases the number of particles moving directly toward one another .",
    "so there are only a finite number of collisions ; when the scattering is over , all particles are moving horizontally , there are no vertical edges , and all the left - moving particles are left of all the right - moving particles . at this point we can cut the diagram in half along the growing edges , and we get two new squashed honeycombs  except that they ve been squashed along the @xmath66 direction rather than the @xmath10 .",
    "these two types of collisions  2-vertex and 4-vertex",
    " correspond to the tetrahedral and octahedral excavations in theorem [ thm : excavation ] .",
    "the hive labels are linearly related to the constant coordinates on the diagonal lines . note that during a 2-vertex collision , the four diagonal lines incident move at a constant speed  on the excavation side , this reflects the fact that excavating a tetrahedron exposes no new vertices and requires no new labeling .",
    "the @xmath174 of the octahedron rule is implemented by the two ways a rectangle can collapse  whichever one comes first determines how the vertices bounce back out .    in the hive excavation picture",
    ", it is easier to deal with degenerate cases uniformly  the octahedron rule still applies , it just happens that the @xmath174 involved is achieved twice .",
    "also the hive picture does nt introduce this spurious `` time '' coordinate ; in particular , the excavation of the large tetrahedron can be done in many different ways , all giving the same answer .    on the other hand , in the honeycomb picture",
    "it is more manifest that the limiting object after scattering is again two honeycombs glued together , rather than having to check the rhombus inequalities in various cases , as occurred in theorem [ thm : excavation ] .",
    "a very similar result is proven in @xcite , though phrased in terms of braid relations rather than excavation .",
    "it is less immediately obvious that their rule is constructing an associator , since it involves _ six _ inputs rather than four .",
    "in fact their pseudo - line arrangements can be corresponded to a partially excavated _ cube _ of size @xmath4 , rather than our tetrahedron , and their braid move corresponds to the removal of one little cube .",
    "as promised in section [ sec : assoc ] , we give a closed - form expression for each entry of the bottom two hives as a `` tropical laurent polynomial '' ( a single maximum over a family of linear expressions ) in the entries of the top two .",
    "this is a special case of a general result proved by speyer in @xcite , conjectured in @xcite : during any order in which we excavate a tetrahedron , a label @xmath136 exposed at time @xmath175 is a laurent polynomial with positive coefficients in those labels on the surface at time @xmath176 .",
    "speyer proves a more precise conjecture due to propp : each laurent monomial in @xmath136 corresponds to a * * matching of a certain graph @xmath177 , meaning a subset of the edges covering each vertex exactly once , where the graph @xmath177 is determined by the @xmath176-surface and the @xmath178-entry .",
    "intriguingly , the `` graphs with open faces '' @xmath177 that speyer constructs to prove this look like partially - scattered honeycombs !    consider the graph @xmath179 ( with some unbounded edges ) constructed by scattering two _ standard _ @xmath4-honeycombs ( meaning , all finite edges of length @xmath49 ) off one another , stopping exactly when the first @xmath4 collisions occur ( simultaneously ) .",
    "this graph has @xmath180 rhombi and two triangular arrays of @xmath181 hexagons .",
    "the @xmath182 example is drawn in figure [ fig : speyer1 ] .",
    "its regions correspond to the labels on the top two faces of a tetrahedron to be excavated .",
    "to expose a bottom entry @xmath136 , there is a unique minimal set of unit tetrahedra and octahedra that must be excavated .",
    "for example , to expose the bottom entry below the @xmath183 in figure [ fig : speyer1 ] , one must remove the octahedra with top points labeled by @xmath184 .",
    "we are now ready to describe the graph @xmath177 that speyer associates to a bottom entry @xmath136 : it is the minimal subgraph of @xmath179 enclosing those entries that must be excavated to get to @xmath136 .",
    "in fact one must also consider the adjoining hexagonal regions in speyer s definition of @xmath177 as a `` graph with open faces '' .",
    "see figure [ fig : bgraph ] for the case @xmath136 being the entry below the @xmath183 .",
    "given such a graph @xmath177 , and a matching @xmath36 of it , speyer defines the * * matching ( laurent ) monomial @xmath185 as the product over all faces of @xmath177 ( including the exterior hexagons ) , of the corresponding variable raised to the power            then if during excavation , we use the rational function octahedron recurrence @xmath186 , the resulting value of @xmath136 can be computed as a sum over all matchings @xmath187 of @xmath177 , of the associated matching monomials @xmath188 .      to compute the figure [ fig : bgraph ] example directly :",
    "the octahedron recurrence gives @xmath189 which agrees with the theorem , being the sum of the terms from figure [ fig : bmatchings ] .",
    "the tropical version is therefore @xmath190      a.  berenstein , a.  zelevinsky , involutions on gel@xmath191fand - tsetlin schemes and multiplicities in skew @xmath192-modules .",
