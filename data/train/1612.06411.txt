    "a viable dark matter ( dm ) particle must be stable over cosmological time scales .",
    "this requirement generally dictates many properties of a dm candidate . depending on the model , it could be absolutely stable or very long lived ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for a general discussion of the stability issue )",
    ". absolute stability may be due , for instance , to a gauge symmetry , as for the electron in the sm .",
    "alternatively , dm could be long - lived for accidental reasons , as the proton , whose stability is associated to a global continuous symmetry , such as the baryon number .",
    "the possibility that dm may be long lived is actually very interesting as its decay could be probed through indirect - detection searches .",
    "constraints from fluxes of cosmic rays impose that the lifetime of dm candidates in the wimp mass range , which we will consider in the sequel , must be typically larger than @xmath0  sec . the most straightforward way to get such a large lifetime is to assume that the decay is induced by the exchange of very heavy particles , encapsulated at low energies by mass - suppressed effective operators . assuming couplings of order one , instability associated to a dimension-5 interaction would require that the heavy degrees of freedom lie way above the planck scale .",
    "in contrast , a dimension-6 operator only requires that these particles are around the gut scale .",
    "this is appealing but also means that the nature of these very heavy degrees of freedom would be impossible to test directly .",
    "alternatively , one could assume that the particles that trigger the decay of dm are much lighter , but then with much smaller couplings ( something that we are usually reluctant to assume , unless protected from large quantum corrections by a symmetry ) .",
    "however this can not be tested either .    in the following",
    "we propose that , along a clockwork mechanism @xcite , a dm particle could be made accidentally stable but have a decay into sm particles induced by order unity interactions with particles that could be produced at colliders .",
    "such a clockwork mechanism does not prevent the dm to undergo fast annihilations into sm particles ( or hidden - sector particles ) so that its relic density is determined by the standard freeze - out mechanism , _",
    "i.e. _ it is a wimp .",
    "as we will see , we need to introduce a lot of new fields ( and specific couplings ) .",
    "one may right away wonder whether this is worth explaining the mere stability of dark matter . however , beside that the potential benefit is to have a whole world of new particles at a rather low scale , implying a rich phenomenology at current and future experiments , the presence of all these fields can be the 4-dimensional consequence of theories with extra - dimensions .",
    "we will show in particular that a fermion clockwork chain can arise in a simple way from the deconstruction of a single field in flat spacetime .",
    "the plan of the article is as follows . in the next section [ sec : clock ]",
    "we build the model , based on the clockwork mechanism and expose the basic properties of the dm candidate .",
    "the basic phenomenology is developed in section  [ sec : pheno ] . in section  [ sec : deconstr ] we discuss how this kind of setup can be minimally obtained from the deconstruction of an extra dimension , whereas in section  [ sec : neutrino ] we comment on the possibility of inducing majorana neutrino masses from a similar mechanism .",
    "we finally draw our conclusions in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "one may  but does not have to  think of the clockwork mechanism as arising from the deconstruction @xcite of an extra spatial dimension .",
    "the resulting `` theory space '' consists of a series of fields with adjacent interactions .",
    "here we start with @xmath1 dirac fermions @xmath2 ( with @xmath3 ) , similarly to  @xcite , together with a single right - handed chiral fermion @xmath4 .",
    "we thus have the following set of @xmath5 chiral fields @xmath6 we refer to this set as the clockwork chain .",
    "each chiral fermion is charged under a @xmath7 chiral symmetry .",
    "the total symmetry group is thus @xmath8 and we identify the last abelian factor with the lepton - number symmetry of the sm : @xmath9 the latter choice makes natural a yukawa coupling @xmath10 of @xmath11 with the sm left - handed leptons , here denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "we also introduce , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , two sets of @xmath1 spurions @xmath13 and @xmath14 with @xmath15 under @xmath16 and @xmath17 under @xmath18 , which break the symmetry ( [ eq : group ] ) to @xmath7 . with these ingredients ,",
    "the lagrangian takes on the form @xmath19 for simplicity we take all spurions to be universal @xmath20 we have also introduced a soft breaking of @xmath21 which gives a majorana mass @xmath22 to the light eigenstate @xmath23 ( thus breaking the residual @xmath7 symmetry ) .",
    "the fermionic mass lagrangian thus reads @xmath24 for the phenomenological analysis in the next section we will focus on the regime @xmath25 , for simplicity .",
    "physically , we thus have a chain of @xmath1 massive dirac fermions , with relatively weaker nearest - neighbour couplings ( that allow the fermions to hop from one site to the other ) .",
    "the majorana particle @xmath4 lies at one extremity of the chain , while the sm fermions live at the other extremity .",
    "the lightest state is ( essentially ) the majorana particle @xmath26 , but it communicates to the sm through a chain of ( relatively heavy , with respect to the hopping scale @xmath27 ) particles , which , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we dub `` clockwork gears '' in the sequel .    going to the mass eigenbasis we get a band of @xmath1 dirac fermions @xmath28 , @xmath29 , with masses @xmath30 ( the exact form of @xmath31 can be found in @xcite ) and a light majorana field @xmath1 which will be our dm candidate .",
    "the mixing matrices are @xmath32 with ( in the limit @xmath33 , @xmath34 , for the general formulas see  @xcite ) @xmath35    in particular , the coupling of the light state with the sm is @xmath36 which is the first key result : through the clockwork mechanism , the effective yukawa coupling between the dm particle and sm fields is suppressed by a factor of @xmath37 .",
    "ultimately the value of this parameter is to be set by the requirement of stability on cosmological scales . assuming that @xmath22 is significantly larger than the relevant thresholds",
    ", the goldstone - boson equivalence theorem gives the decay width @xmath38 for @xmath39 the decay processes are at 1-loop level , and the bound on @xmath40 and @xmath1 below is slightly weaker . by requiring that the decays are slower than the age of the universe",
    "@xmath41 , we get the bound : @xmath42 by requiring that the lifetime is larger than the typical indirect - detection bound @xmath43 , we get instead @xmath44 as an example , for @xmath45{gev}$ ] and @xmath46 , this can be satisfied by @xmath47 hence for a mild hierarchy of mass scales @xmath27 and @xmath48 . for smaller values of @xmath40 , one needs , for instance , @xmath49 note that this conclusion is not ruined by loop corrections .",
    "the corrections to the decay width of @xmath1 in eq .",
    "are all suppressed by the clockwork mechanism , because the fermion line starting from @xmath1 has to go through the whole clockwork chain to mix with @xmath50 and interact with the sm fermions .",
    "so far the lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lag1 ] ) leads to a long lived dm candidate but does not provide any dm annihilation process , apart from @xmath51 and @xmath52 , which are doubly suppressed by the clockwork chain and thus far too slow to account for the dm relic density . therefore a clockwork wimp dm scenario requires extra interaction(s ) that are not suppressed by the clockwork chain . in the following",
    "we will consider two simple possibilities .",
    "[ [ scenario-1 . ] ] * scenario 1 . * + + + + + + + + + + + + +    a first one consists in simply promoting the spurions into dynamical scalar fields , acquiring a vev so that ( again , taking them universal for simplicity ) the @xmath27 and @xmath48 parameters above are now defined as @xmath53 in this case eq .",
    "( [ eq : lag1 ] ) provides yukawa interactions and possible additional interactions are the scalar ones : @xmath54 for simplicity we consider here that all the quartic couplings are of the same order ( and take them to have the same value @xmath55 along the clockwork chain ) . depending on the mass spectrum of the model , the quartic couplings may or may not be necessary to have an efficient annihilation channel .",
    "for instance , as will be discussed below , if @xmath56 the dominant annihilation is @xmath57 , which proceeds even if the quartic couplings vanish . in the opposite situation",
    "the quartic couplings are necessary in order to induce @xmath13-@xmath58 and/or @xmath14-@xmath58 mixing , leading to annihilation into a pair of @xmath58 or into @xmath59 or @xmath60 .",
    "similarly , such quartic couplings are interesting because they lead to possibilities of direct detection .",
    "thus , important ingredients along this scenario 1 are the effective yukawa couplings of @xmath1 with the higgs boson @xmath58 and the clockwork gears . in the 4-component notation for the spinors",

    "the important result is that the interaction of the dm particle @xmath1 to the higgs boson @xmath58 and the clockwork gears is not suppressed by the clockwork mechanism . in other words",

    "the final meg limit @xcite on the branching ratio for @xmath166 is given by @xmath168 although this limit is stronger than the one from ewpt for @xmath169 , it crucially depends on both the muon and electron couplings being sizeable .",
    "this result will be improved in the near future by 4 orders of magnitudes by the @xmath167 conversion experiments mu2e  @xcite and comet  @xcite .",
