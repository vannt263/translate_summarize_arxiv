    "among the properties of hadronic matter at finite temperature , whose dynamics is described by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the spectral function of the electromagnetic current plays an important role since it contains the full information on the dilepton / photon production rate  @xcite , the electrical conductivity , and the modification of the spectral properties of vector mesons at finite temperature .",
    "all these quantities have been intensively studied in the context of heavy ion collisions .",
    "the spectral function has therefore naturally been investigated within many approaches , such as perturbative qcd  @xcite , the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite , model calculations  @xcite , low - energy effective theory based on hadronic degrees of freedom  @xcite , sum rules  @xcite , and lattice qcd  @xcite , which have led to a large number of diverse results",
    ". under such circumstances , it is useful to have exact constraints on the spectral function that all approaches should satisfy . especially in lattice qcd , which can be directly applicable only for static quantities , it would be useful to have such constraints since the spectral function is a dynamical quantity and thus can not be computed directly .",

    "we furthermore check that the sum rules are satisfied at weak coupling by explicit perturbative calculations , and examine their sensitivity to the peak in the spectral function which is caused by the transport process of the quarks ( transport peak ) and the continuum generated by free quark pair creation processes .",
    "next , we discuss potential applications of the sum rules to lattice qcd studies of the spectral function . these include the possibility of providing constraints to the spectral function ansatz used to fit the euclidean vector correlator lattice data , improvements for this ansatz , and the extraction of the second order transport coefficient @xmath1 from the spectral function obtained from a fit to lattice data .    , used in the integral of eq .",

    "next , we can check to what degree our spectral function satisfies sum rule 2 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sumrule-2-free ] ) . as we have explained in section [ subsectionsumrule2 ] , the difference between the sum rules of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sumrule-2 ] ) and ( [ eq : sumrule-2-free ] ) corresponds to a non - exponentially suppressed uv tail of the spectral function .",
    "as this tail is not included in the parametrization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ansatz - a ] ) , its integral should be compared to eq .",
    "( [ eq : sumrule-2-free ] ) and not eq .",
    "( [ eq : sumrule-2 ] ) .",

    "( [ eq : parameters ] ) , we get @xmath208 with @xmath209 .",
    "this value is marked as a cross on the lower right corner in the second plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : condensate ] .",
    "note that the lattice data of ref .",
    "@xcite are given at @xmath210 .",
    "for @xmath133 , we have used @xmath211 , suitable for quenched qcd . as can be seen in this plot , the integrated value of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sumrule2.integral ] ) lies very close to the leading order perturbative qcd result , showing that sum rule 2 can be satisfied with reasonable precision , if the condensates on its right - hand - side approach the perturbative limit quickly enough . to study this question in more detail ,",
    "an explicit lattice calculation of @xmath212 will however be needed .    in this context",
    ", we note that one could try to construct a spectral function that is consistent with the sum rule of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sumrule-2 ] ) . for this purpose",
    ", one would need to include the above - mentioned uv tail in the ansatz ( ansatz b ) : @xmath213 \\\\ & + a(\\omega)(1+k)\\rho_{\\text{cont}}(\\omega )   + c_{uv } \\theta(\\omega-\\omega_{\\text{min}})\\rho_{\\text{tail}}(\\omega)\\bigr ] ,   \\end{split } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath214^{-\\tilde{a}-1}.   \\label{eq : ansatz - b.2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath5 in the above expression stands for euler s number .",
    "this form has two extra fitting parameters @xmath215 and @xmath216 , and would in principle allow us to use the exact sum rule of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sumrule-2 ] ) . here",
    "@xmath217 corresponds to the perturbative result at @xmath78 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : uv - tail ] ) . in this work",
    ", we will not pursue this possibility any further and only illustrate the potential effect of @xmath218 by adding it to our fitted spectral function , using @xmath219 , @xmath220 , @xmath217 , and @xmath221 .",
    "the result is shown as a blue dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectral ] . as one can see in this figure , the uv tail",
    "just modestly modifies the spectral function in the plotted energy region , at least with the parameters used here .",
    "it should also be noted that the parametrization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ansatz - b ] ) does not provide a completely realistic description of the spectral function around @xmath222 , where it contains a discontinuity .",
    "our low energy step - function cutoff however provides the most simple description of the onset of the uv tail with the fewest numbers of parameters , and does not cause any divergence in our sum rules . for these reasons , we have adopted this simple cut - off scheme .",
    "it is also likely to be useful for future spectral function fits to lattice qcd data , which take the uv tail into account .    as a last point",
    ", we next discuss the application of sum rule 3 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sumrule-3 ] ) . at first ,",
    "let us clarify the definition of the parameter appearing in the left - hand side , @xmath1 .",
    "it is expressed in terms of the retarded green function as , @xmath223 as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gr - hydro ] ) .",
    "@xmath1 therefore does not explicitly appear in the spectral function since it corresponds to the real part of @xmath18 .",
    "as the transport coefficient @xmath1 is furthermore at present not known , this sum rule can not be used as an additional fitting constraint . if the spectral function is however already determined from other sources , eq .",
    "( [ eq : sumrule-3 ] ) can be used to estimate @xmath1 .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ansatz - a]-[eq : sigma.value ] ) , we get @xmath224 to our knowledge , this is the first time that this transport coefficient has been determined non - perturbatively .",
    "note that the above number is a quenched qcd estimate , as we have made use of quenched lattice data to fix the spectral function .",
    "we do not expect that introducing the uv - tail such as in ansatz b in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ansatz - b ] ) and ( [ eq : ansatz - b.2 ] ) will strongly modify the above numerical result for @xmath225 , because the contribution from the high energy part of the spectral function to the sum rule 3 is strongly suppressed , as we have discussed at the end of the previous section .",
    "we have explicitly checked this by computing @xmath1 from sum rule 3 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sumrule-3 ] ) , using both ans@xmath226tze a and b with the parameter values given above . as a result",
    ", we found that the extracted values of @xmath1 only differ by about 0.1% , which shows that in practice it does not matter which ansatz is used for sum rule 3 .",
    "we should furthermore mention here that , all the ans@xmath226tze used in this section do not take into account the large @xmath227 suppressed nonanalytic behavior at small @xmath11 ( which seems to be challenging to see in current lattice qcd analysis ) caused by hydro mode coupling .",
    "it is therefore consistent to use sum rule 3 ( [ eq : sumrule-3 ] ) , which does not consider this effect as well .    .",
    "note that ans@xmath226tze a and b are identical for @xmath228 , where they overlap .",

    "( [ eq : ansatz - a ] ) ( blue dashed line).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "we give a few final comments on future perspectives of this work . in this paper",
    "we have so far for simplicity only analyzed the zero - momentum ( @xmath9 ) case .",
    "generalizing our analysis to finite , but small @xmath230 is straightforward and is worth investigating in detail . in this case",
    ", one needs to analyze both the longitudinal and the transverse channels separately . apart from that ,",
    "other transport coefficients such as the diffusion constant and another one related to the magnetic sector will appear in the sum rules .",
    "also , since the sum rules are exact , it would be interesting to check their validity by explicit calculations in the hadron phase below @xmath133 and/or the strong coupling regime .",
    "we plan to report on parts of these generalizations in a full publication in the near future .",
