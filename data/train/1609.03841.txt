    "we are concerned here with the dynamics of nonlinear waves in lattices .",
    "this subject has stimulated researches in a wide range of areas , including the theory of solitons and the dynamics of discrete networks .",
    "numerous studies have been led in electromagnetism and optics @xcite , and many physical phenomena have been highlighted , such as discrete breathers @xcite , chaotic phenomena @xcite , dynamical multistability @xcite and solitons or solitary waves @xcite .",
    "we focus more specifically on solitary waves , which have been first observed and studied for surface waves in shallow water @xcite .",
    "the main feature of these waves is that they can propagate without change of shape and with a velocity depending of their amplitude @xcite .",
    "they have been studied in many physical systems , as in fluid dynamics , optics or plasma physics .    for elastic waves ,",
    "numerous works have highlighted the existence of solitary waves in microstructured solids @xcite , periodic structures such as lattices or crystals @xcite , elastic layers @xcite , layered structures coated by film of soft material @xcite , periodic chains of elastics beads @xcite and uniform or inhomogeneous rods @xcite .",
    "on the contrary , only a few works have dealt with acoustic solitary waves .",
    "such a lack is mainly explained by the fact that the intrinsic dispersion of acoustic equations is too low to compete with the nonlinear effects , preventing from the occurrence of solitons . to observe these waves ,",
    "geometrical dispersion must be introduced .",
    "it has been the object of the works of sugimoto and his co - authors @xcite , where the propagation of nonlinear waves was considered in a tube connected to an array of helmholtz resonators .",
    "a model incorporating both the nonlinear wave propagation in the tube and the nonlinear oscillations in the resonators has been proposed .",
    "theoretical and experimental investigations have shown the existence of acoustic solitary waves @xcite .",
    "we have developed a numerical modeling , and we have successfully compared simulations with experimental data @xcite .",
    "one fundamental assumption underlying sugimoto s model is that all the resonators are the same , which allows to use a homogenization process .",
    "the drawback of this approach is that the reflection of an incident wave by a defect ( for instance , a resonator different from the others ) can not be considered .",
    "similarly , wave propagation across resonators with variable features can not be investigated .",
    "however , the case of variable resonators is important when studying the influence of manufacturing defects or the influence of aging of the guiding device on the wave propagation .",
    "the aim of this paper is to remedy these limitations , by building a model predicting two - way propagation across variable resonators . for this purpose",
    ", we introduce a discrete description of the resonators .",
    "a consequence is that the requirement of a long wavelength is no longer necessary .",
    "second , we allow the reflection of waves . finally , we reformulate the viscothermal losses , which leads to a formulation suitable for an energy balance .",
    "the new model writes as a single system coupling three unknowns , the velocity of the right - going wave @xmath0 , the velocity of the left - going wave @xmath1 and the total excess pressure in the resonators @xmath2 , induced by both waves : @xmath3 { \\displaystyle}\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}^- + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x } \\left(- a u^- + b { \\displaystyle}\\frac{(u^-)^2}{2 } \\right ) + \\frac{c}{a } \\frac{\\partial^{1/2}}{\\partial t^{1/2}}u^- - d \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}^- = + e(1 - 2 m p ) { \\displaystyle}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t } , \\\\ [ 12pt ] { \\displaystyle}\\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial t^2 } + f \\frac{\\partial^{3/2}}{\\partial t^{3/2}}p + g p - m\\frac{\\partial^2 ( p^2 ) } { \\partial t^2 } + n \\left|\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t}\\right|\\,\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t } = h ( u^+ - u^- ) . \\end{array } \\right .",
