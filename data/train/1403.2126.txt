    "the magnetic recording `` trilemma '' describes the frustration inherent in simultaneously optimizing signal - to - noise , maximizing thermal stability , and reducing switching field distribution in magnetic media.@xcite in particular , the latter two goals are seemingly mutually exclusive - it is desirable to write bits with the smallest possible field , but once written , those bits need to be as stable as possible .",
    "exchanged coupled composites ( ecc ) - featuring a high anisotropy `` hard '' magnetic layer to serve as an anchor against thermal fluctuations exchange coupled to a low anisotropy `` soft '' magnetic layer to assist reversal - have been proposed as an optimized solution.@xcite suess took the concept further , proposing that a multilayer where the anisotropy gradually varied from top to bottom of the stack would constitute an ideally optimized ecc.@xcite since , such `` graded anisotropy '' magnetic multilayers have been studied both theoretically@xcite and experimentally , including for multilayers where the anisotropy profile was controlled by varying layer thickness,@xcite composition,@xcite and substrate temperature.@xcite    during magnetron sputtering , deposition pressure is known to have strong influence on the magnetic properties of sputtered co / pt @xcite and and co / pd@xcite multilayers . as sputtering pressure is increased , the film becomes more disordered , and reversal becomes a more localized process .",
    "this results in smaller domains , increased coercivity , wider switching field distribution , and decreased saturation magnetization.@xcite thus , varying the sputtering pressure throughout deposition is potentially an attractively simple method for tailoring depth - dependent reversal properties without changing the material composition - for example to achieve a graded anisotropy structure . such `` pressure - graded '' co / pd samples have been studied with magnetometry , scanning electron microscopy with polarization analysis , and polarized neutron reflectometry ( pnr),@xcite but these studies have not addressed the nature of the anisotropy profile - i.e. the rate at which the magnetization at different depths in the multilayer changes with field . with this in mind , we have used pnr to determine the depth - resolved hard axis magnetization curves for a pressure - graded co / pd multilayer .",

    "vibrating sample magnetometry ( vsm ) was used to measure the room temperature field - dependent magnetization , for magnetic field applied both perpendicular and parallel to the plane of the sample , as shown in figure 1 .",

    "it is straightforward to exactly calculate the reflectivity corresponding to a given scattering length density profile,@xcite thus depth profiles of both @xmath13 and @xmath9 can be determined through model fitting of the measured spin - dependent reflectivities . since specular pnr is insensitive to the component of the magnetization perpendicular to the sample surface,@xcite primary measurements",
    "were conducted as a function of decreasing in - plane @xmath2 from 3.0 - 0.1 t , followed by a measurement at 10 t. this procedure allowed for characterization of the in - plane magnetization depth profile as spins in the sample progressively relaxed away from a hard - axis orientation .",

    "in contrast to the flat co / pd nuclear profile , a highly non - uniform magnetic profile was required to fit the data .",
    "the magnetic model used consists of two magnetic layers with a broad   30 nm error function interface .",
    "this model was found to fit the data better than 3 discrete layers with sharp interfaces , even at the highest applied fields .",
    "the 2 @xmath20 uncertainty for the high and low @xmath5 magnetizations was calculated using a markov chain monte carlo algorithm,@xcite and was found to be less than 10 ka m@xmath12 for all values .    at the initial applied field of 3 t ,",
    "the magnetization profile is highly nonuniform , as @xmath9 decreases with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "the similar profile determined from a subsequent measurement at 10 t shows that this nonuniformity is not due to lack of magnetic saturation , but instead originates from a saturation magnetization ( @xmath21 ) that varies significantly with @xmath5 . for high field ,",

    ", @xmath9 drops for all @xmath5 , corresponding to spins rotating away from the hard axis direction . while the magnetization gradient is apparent at all fields in fig .",
    "3(b ) , the depth - dependent variation in @xmath21 makes it difficult to discern variations in anisotropy - i.e. it masks variations in the _ rate _ at which the @xmath9 drops with @xmath2 . to make this rate apparent , figure 3(c ) shows the magnetization profiles in 3(b ) normalized by the nominally saturating 10 t profile . plotting in this way , we see that particularly at low @xmath2 , @xmath9 drops with reduced @xmath2 much faster at high @xmath5 than at low @xmath5 .",
    "i.e. , the sample is progressively harder to magnetize in - plane as deposition pressure increases with increasing distance from the substrate interface .",
    "these field - dependent profiles can be put into a more familiar context by extracting slices of the field - dependent magnetization profile , and plotting @xmath24 corresponding to different depths in the sample .",

    "4(a ) demonstrates the clear pressure ( depth ) dependent variations in saturation magnetization , while fig .",
    "4(b ) shows that as as pressure is increased the magnetization drops faster with decreasing field . that the rate at which magnetization drops with field indeed changes with depth ,",
    "demonstrates that pressure grading does result in a corresponding gradient in the _ effective _ anisotropy .",
    "the observed gradient in effective anisotropy likely arises from several factors that are difficult to disentangle , including pressure - dependent variations in crystalline disorder , intrinsic magnetocrystalline and interfacial anisotropy , domain size , and saturation magnetization . while we can not uniquely isolate the depth - dependencies of the rest of these parameters , pnr measurements",
    "do reveal the depth - dependence of @xmath21 .",
    "this @xmath21 gradient plays a critical role in the reversal behavior , and must be accounted for in potential device applications .",
    "consider that to first order , the _ field _ associated with uniaxial anisotropy of energy density ( anisotropy constant ) @xmath25 is linearly dependent on both @xmath25 and @xmath21@xcite @xmath26 therefore , by definition , the observed 40 % gradient in @xmath21 linearly affects the profile of the anisotropy field .",
    "in addition , @xmath21 ( i.e. the magnitude of the magnetization vector ) has a linear effect on the zeeman energy - the energy penalty corresponding to the deviation of magnetization vector from the direction of the applied field . if we define @xmath27 to be the angle between the easy axis and the magnetization vector , the zeeman energy is defined@xcite @xmath28    thus , we identify two simple channels for @xmath21 to linearly affect reversal behavior . to further illustrate this point , we have used the oommf micromagnetic software package@xcite to simulate easy - axis hysteresis loops for three different `` pillars '' of spins , all with the same _ average _ anisotropy constant and saturation magnetization , but with different _ distributions _ of @xmath25 and @xmath21 .",
    "each pillar consists of a 10 @xmath29 10 @xmath29 64 nm array of 1 nm@xmath30 spins , with an exchange constant of @xmath31 = 0.178 pj m@xmath12 , a value chosen such that the spins in different regions are neither rigidly coupled , nor effectively decoupled .",
    "the average @xmath21 = 629 ka m@xmath12 ( i.e. the average value determined from pnr ) , and the average @xmath25 = 710 kj @xmath32 ( a reasonable value for co / pd@xcite ) .",
    "cartoon depictions of the three spin structures considered are shown in figure 5(a ) : constant @xmath25 ( 710 kj m@xmath33 ) with constant @xmath21 ( 629 ka m@xmath12 ) , a 40 % graded @xmath25 ( 500 - 1200 kj m@xmath33 ) with constant @xmath21 ( 629 ka m@xmath12 ) , and constant @xmath25 ( 710 kj m@xmath33 ) with a 40 % graded @xmath21 ( 370 - 900 ka m@xmath12 , i.e. the @xmath21 profile shown for fig .",
    "3(c ) ) . figure 5(b ) shows simulated hysteresis loops for @xmath2 along the long ( easy ) axes of the pillars . in this example , a 40 % gradient in @xmath25 indeed softens the loop , resulting in a 19 % reduction in coercive field as compared to the constant @xmath25 , constant @xmath21 pillar .",
    "however , a 40 % gradient in @xmath21 results in an even larger 29 % decrease in coercive field .",
    "while the actual mechanism of reversal in pressure - graded co / pd is certainly more complicated than can be described with this simple simulation , this result emphasizes the significant role of the @xmath21 gradient .",
    "this intrinsic variation in @xmath21 certainly must be considered in the design of actual devices based on pressure - graded co / pd , and may be exploitable as a knob for precisely tailoring magnetization reversal properties in magnetic media .",
    "we explicitly demonstrate that a simple technique of varying pressure during magnetron sputtering can be used to create magnetic multilayers exhibiting a pronounced vertical gradient in the effective anisotropy .",
    "in addition to the anisotropy gradient , we find that pressure grading leads to a pronounced gradient in the saturation magnetization , and that this saturation magnetization gradient critically affects the magnetic reversal properties .",
    "further , this work demonstrates how detailed polarized neutron reflectometry measurements of the depth - resolved , hard - axis magnetization curves can be used to extract information about the depth - dependent anisotropy that is difficult or impossible to acquire through other techniques .",
