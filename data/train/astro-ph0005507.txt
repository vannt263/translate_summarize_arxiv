    "other parameters which characterize the shape of the light curve , such as the time of maximum brightness or @xmath21 , can then be derived from the best - fit model .",
    "although the model is a completely empirical description of the general shape of sne  ia light curves , we note that theoretical models ( pinto & eastman @xcite ) predict a gaussian shape for the peak in models with constant opacity and buried well within the ejecta .    fig .",
    "[ fit.ps ] shows the example of the fit to the light curve of sn  1992bc .",
    "the various components of the fit are displayed . the exponential function ( solid line )",
    "rises steeply to unity , modeling the rapid brightness increase of the supernova .",
    "the decline rate ( dotted line ) is set by the long tail beginning about 50 days past maximum .",

    "the small systematic undulations of the residuals indicate that the fit is not perfect and can be used to make detailed comparisons between individual supernovae .",
    "we have fitted this model to the filter light curves of more than 50 supernovae .",
    "these fits will be presented in forthcoming papers .",
    "the fits produce objective measures of the magnitude and date of maximum , the extent of the peak phase , the amplitude and extent of the secondary peak , the late decline rate , and an estimate of the rise time .",
    "the accuracy of these parameters depends strongly on the number and quality of the observations in each phase . while in most cases the late decline",
    "can be derived fairly easily , the rise time is undetermined when no pre - maximum observations are available .",
    "it is possible to derive other light curve shape descriptions , such as @xmath21 , for each filter objectively and independently without comparison to templates .",

    "however , the late decline ( linear in magnitudes ) and the steep rise can be assumed to have simple functional forms .",
    "fitting polynomials or spline functions , for example , could not produce the transition to the linear decline as observed , but would simply transfer the undulations of the early phases to the late decline and fail to match the observed linear decline .",
    "furthermore , such functions would not provide a small set of adjustable parameters which can be compared between different objects .",
    "nevertheless , the adopted functional form is not a perfect representation of all optical filter light curves . when fitting the light curves of some sne  ia we found that the model had difficulties to match the observations with the same accuracy as in the other filters .",

    "[ fiti.ps ] .",
    "the slope of the band light curve decline ( dotted line ) is so steep that the model can not reproduce the observed light curve .",
    "this steep slope causes the function to overshoot the observed values near the second maximum and the fitting program inverts the second gaussian to produce the observed minimum in the light curve . if the fitting routine is constrained to fit only positive gaussians , the exponential rising function ( solid line ) is shifted to late times and depresses the linear decay ( dotted line ) before the second maximum ; in addition the first gaussian ( dashed line ) is enhanced and shifted to earlier times .",
    "this implies that , for the band , the fitted parameters describing the first gaussian ( i.e.  its magnitude , its center and its standard deviation ) can not be used to characterize the first maximum , even if the light curve appears fitted well . in spite of this problem ,",
    "the i band light curves of the sne in our sample can all be reasonably well fit by the model and the data can be represented by the continuous fits .",
    "this also means that the derived light curve parameters , e.g. decline rates , are meaningful .",
    "this steep decline in the band is a rather unexpected result .",
    "the physical explanation behind this behavior is that the filter light curve is dominated by a rapidly decreasing flux component and significant flux redistribution takes place in the evolution .",
    "similar results have been found by suntzeff ( @xcite ) in the observations of sn  1992a and pinto & eastman ( @xcite , see also eastman @xcite ) in theoretical models .",
    "the fitting procedure provides an estimate of the goodness - of - fit , as well as the associated uncertainties on the fit parameters .",
    "uncertainties on the derived quantities depend strongly on the quality and number of data points .",
    "if there are no data before 5 days prior to maximum , e.g. , the rise time can not be determined reliably .",
    "we have estimated the uncertainties using a monte carlo method .",
    "we constructed synthetic data sets with the same temporal sampling as the observed light curve .",
    "the magnitude at each point was computed from the best fit model , with the assumption of a gaussian probability distribution whose width was given by the observational uncertainty .",
    "the standard deviations of the observed data points range from 0.03 to 0.14 magnitudes . in this manner , 2000 synthetic data sets were simulated .",
    "each synthetic data set was fit and the frequency distribution for each model parameter was constructed .",
    "two examples of the resulting distributions ( the time of maximum and the magnitude at maximum for sn  1992bc ) are shown as histograms in fig .",
    "the differences between the mean and the best fit is less than 0.03 days for the time of maximum and less than 0.01 magnitudes for the peak brightness . in this example",
    "the skewness and kurtosis are negligible .",
    "non - zero values of skewness and kurtosis provide an indication of the unreliability of the derived fit parameters .    occasionally the standard deviations obtained for a fit parameter from the fitting procedure differed significantly from the values obtained from the monte carlo simulations .",
    "this arises because the standard deviations derived from the fit are calculated from the diagonal elements of the curvature matrix , while the standard deviations derived from the monte carlo simulations result from actual frequency distributions .",

    "we also corrected the magnitudes for extinction , which , for some objects , can be fairly substantial ( sn  1989b , sn  1991 t , and sn  1994ae ) . from table",
    "[ tab : lum ] it is clear that our sample displays a rather large range in luminosities , both in and the bolometric maximum .",
    "sn  1991bg is 11 times less luminous in than the brightest sn  ia in the sample , sn  1991 t . for the bolometric maximum we find a factor of 12.3 . excluding this peculiar object we still find a range in luminosity of a factor 4.7 in the filter passband and a factor of 3.3 in the bolometric peak flux .",
    "the shapes of the bolometric light curves are unaffected by the distance modulus and are only marginally influenced by reddening ( see sect .",
    "[ discussbol ] ) .",
    "the most striking feature in these light curves is the inflection near 25 days past maximum ( suntzeff @xcite ) .",
    "it is observed in all sne  ia , with the notable exception of sn  1991bg ( fig .",
    "[ lumbol ] ) .",
    "the strength of this shoulder varies from a rather weak flattening in the bolometric light curve of sn  1991 t to a very strong bump in sn  1994d .",
    "this bump arises from the strong secondary maximum in the and light curves .",
    "the secondary maximum is also observed in the near - ir light curves ( elias et al .",
    "@xcite , meikle @xcite , meikle & hernandez @xcite ) which have not been used for the calculation of bolometric light curves presented here .",

    "[ lumbol ] clearly shows the brighter sne having wider primary peaks than the fainter sne .    in order to quantify this statement",
    "we have measured the width of the bolometric light curve at half the peak luminosity ( with @xmath39 denoting the time it takes to rise and @xmath40 to decline , see table [ tab : lum ] ) .",
    "there are sufficient pre - maximum observations available for six supernovae ( sn  1991 t , sn  1992a , sn  1992bc , sn  1992bo , sn  1994d , and sn",
    "1994ae ) from which the full width of the peaks can be reliably determined . in three cases",
    "the first observations were obtained well below the half - maximum flux level ; in the case of sn  1991 t we extrapolated our bolometric light curve by about 1.5 days and for sn  1992a and sn  1992bc by 2.5 days .",
    "the bright sn  1991 t and sn  1992bc show a peak width of 26 and 23 days , respectively , the intermediate sn  1994ae one of 22 days , while the fainter sn  1994d , sn  1992a , and sn  1992bo remained brighter than half their maximum luminosity for about 18 to 19 days .",
    "the pre - maximum rise @xmath39 in the bolometric light curve is , in all cases , substantially faster than the decline @xmath40 by between 20 to 30% or a time difference of between 2 to almost 4 days ( table  [ tab : lum ] ) .",
    "the decline to half the supernova s peak luminosity @xmath40 varies from 9 days to 14 days .",
    "a weak correlation between maximum brightness and decline rate can be seen ( fig .",
    "[ thalf ] ) .",
    "the sample of sne was extended to the one used in sect .",
    "[ epmax ] . in fig .",
    "[ thalf ] only those sne with sufficient time coverage are shown .",
    "significant coverage of the rise to maximum is available for only two supernovae .",
    "there are too few sne to make a definitive statement here about the rise times of sne  ia in general .",
    "nevertheless , our formal fits to sn  1994d and sn  1994ae give rise times of 16.4 and 18.2 days , respectively , for their bolometric light curves .",
    "the formal errors in this parameter , derived with the monte carlo algorithm described in sect .",
    "[ fitunc ] , is 2 days for sn  1994d and 1 day for sn  1994ae .",
    "if the bolometric luminosities are calculated by fitting the bolometric light curve from the individual observations , the derived rise times are slightly different ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 days , respectively ) .",
    "a previous analysis of sn  1994d derived a rise time for the bolometric light curve of 18 days ( vacca & leibundgut @xcite ) in fair agreement with our current analysis .",
    "these rise times are significantly larger than most light curve calculation of explosion models ( hflich et al .",
    "@xcite , pinto & eastman @xcite ) .",
    "these theoretical calculations typically yield rise times of 15 days .",
    "the secondary bump clearly indicates a change in the emission mechanism of sne  ia .",
    "its varying strength might be related to the release of photons `` stored '' in the ejecta ( the `` old '' photons described in pinto & eastman @xcite and eastman @xcite ) . in such a scenario the bump arises from the fact that the ejecta become optically thin during this phase , due to subtle differences in the ejecta structure and ejecta velocity .",
    "the exponential decline of the bolometric light curves between 50 and 80 days past bolometric maximum is remarkably similar for all supernovae .",
    "the decline at this phase is still dominated by the decay and the @xmath2ray escape fraction ( milne et al .",
    "we find a decline rate of 2.6@xmath430.2 mag per 100  days .",
    "the sample is still very small but sn  1991bg stands out with a decline rate of 3.0  mag/(100  days ) .",
    "the uniformity of the late declines indicates that the differences observed at earlier phases are due to photospheric effects when the optical depth for optical radiation is large and not because of the explosion mechanism . in particular the fraction of energy converted to optical radiation at late phases appears to change in an identical fashion for the majority of the objects , although sn  1991bg proves to be the exception to the rule once again .",
    "the change in the column density in the different supernovae must be very similar , despite the different luminosities at these epochs .",
    "this indicates that the kinetic energy is somehow coupled to the pre - supernova mass .",
    "the decline rate during the same period in the filter is identical with 2.6@xmath430.2 mag/(100  days ) as is also confirmed by the constant fraction of the to the bolometric flux ( cf .",
    "[ corr ] ) .",
    "these decline rates have been shown to correlate very well with measurements derived by others ( vacca & leibundgut @xcite ) .",
    "the comparison with other determinations of the decline rate is difficult as the slope of the decline continues to vary even at late epochs ( e.g. suntzeff @xcite , turatto et al.@xcite ) .",
    "this dependence on the epochs observed has to be considered when a comparison is attempted . in most cases",
    "the decline was estimated out to phases of 200 days ( turatto et al .",
    "@xcite ) , which leads to smaller decline rates than we find here . in the case of sn",
    "1991bg the decline rate was measured at early phases , which led to a significantly steeper decline estimate ( filippenko et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "note that the phase range of bolometric light curves presented in this paper is well before any effects of positron escape could be measured ( milne et al .",
    "@xcite ) or the ir catastrophe takes place ( fransson et al .",
    "@xcite ) .      given the peak luminosity it is straight forward to derive the nickel mass which powers the supernova emission .",
    "near maximum light the photon escape equals the instantaneous energy input and is directly related to the total amount of synthesized in the explosion ( arnett @xcite , arnett et al .",
    "@xcite , pinto & eastman @xcite ) .",
    "we have used our bolometric peak luminosities to derive the nickel masses ( table  [ tab : lum ] ) . since we are not sampling all the emerging energy from the sne  ia , but are restricted to the optical fluxes , we are underestimating the total luminosity .",
    "suntzeff ( @xcite ) estimated that about 10% are not accounted by the optical filters near maximum light .",
    "all masses thus have to be increased by a factor 1.1 .",
    "another uncertainty is the exact rise time , which is an important parameter in the calculation .",
    "we have assumed a rise time of 17 days to the bolometric maximum for all supernovae .",
    "it is likely that there are significant differences in the rise times and this would alter the estimates for the ni mass .",
    "a longer rise time would imply a larger nickel mass for a given measured luminosity . decreasing the rise time to 12 days yields only 70% @xmath44 of the values given in table  [ tab : lum ] .",
    "such a short rise time is excluded for most of the sne  ia , where observations as early as 14 days have been recorded ( sn  1990n : leibundgut et al .",
    "@xcite , lira et al .",
    "@xcite , sn  1994d : vacca & leibundgut @xcite ) , but could still be feasible for sn  1991bg . for a more realistic range of 16 to 20 days between explosion and bolometric maximum",
    "the nickel mass would change by only @xmath4510% from the values provided here .",
    "clearly , the dominant uncertainty in the determination of the nickel mass stems from the uncertainties in the distances and the extinction corrections .    for a few of the supernovae ,",
    "nickel masses have been measured by other methods .",
    "sn  1991 t has an upper limit for the radioactive nickel produced in the explosion of about 1  @xmath1 based on the 1.644@xmath46 m fe lines ( spyromilio et al .",
    "this value depends on the exact ionization structure of the supernova one year after explosion and a conservative range of 0.4 to 1 @xmath1 had been derived .",
    "this is fully consistent with our estimate .",
    "bowers et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have derived nickel masses for several sne  ia in a similar way .",
    "their best estimates for sn  1991 t , sn  1994ae , and sn  1995d are all about half the value found here , when converted to their distances and extinctions . however , they point out that their values should be increased by a factor of 1.2 to 1.7 to account for ionization states not included in their analysis . with this correction",
    "we find a good agreement .",
    "cappellaro et al .",
    "( @xcite ) derived masses from the late light curves .",
    "there are four objects in common with our study : sn  1991bg , sn  1991 t , sn  1992a , and sn  1994d .",
    "adjusting the determinations to the same distances and re - normalizing to our sn  1991 t ni mass , we find a general agreement , although there are differences at the 0.1 @xmath1 level .",
    "nickel masses were also derived from the line profiles of [ fe  ii ] and [ fe  iii ] lines in the optical by mazzali et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "these measurements depend critically on the ionization structure in the ejecta and had been normalized to a nickel mass of sn  1991 t of 1  @xmath1 .",
    "when we scale their masses to our measurement we find a reasonable agreement .",
    "the nickel masses derived in our analysis are well within the bounds of the current models for sn  ia explosions ( hflich et al .",
    "@xcite , woosley & weaver @xcite ) .",
    "there seems to be no real difference in produced by the various explosion models and hence a distinction by the bolometric light curve alone is not possible .",
    "fitting light curves with a descriptive model has a number of advantages over template methods .",
    "it is suited to explore the variety among sn  ia and provides an independent way to look for correlations .",
    "a simple application of our fitting procedure has been presented to demonstrate the complicated nature of sn  ia emission through the occurrence of the peak luminosity in individual filters .",
    "the most obvious signatures for non - thermal emission from sne  ia have so far been the infrared light curves ( elias et al .",
    "@xcite ) and the lack of emission near 1.2@xmath46 m ( spyromilio et al .",
    "@xcite , wheeler et al.@xcite ) .",
    "it had also been demonstrated through spectral synthesis calculations ( hflich et al .",
    "@xcite , eastman @xcite ) .",
    "although there is a fairly large scatter of about 2 days in the relative epoch of filter maximum light a clear trend to earlier maxima in and is observed .",
    "in fact , the maximum occurs clearly _ before _ the maximum , a trend also observed in the light curves ( elias et al .",
    "@xcite , meikle @xcite ) .",
    "another application of the continuous approximation of the observations is the construction of bolometric light curves .",
    "bolometric light curves form an important link between the explosion models and the radiation transport calculations for sne  ia ejecta .",
    "we have demonstrated that the effects of missing passbands , distance modulus , reddening , light curve fitting and the integration methods are not critical to the shape . amongst these ,",
    "the uncertainties from the distance modulus towards individual supernovae dominate .",
    "the shapes of the bolometric light curve of individual sne  ia vary significantly .",
    "the secondary maxima observed in the and light curves show up with varying strength in the bolometric light curves as well .",
    "the variety of light curve shapes indicates subtle variations in the energy release of these explosions .",
    "pinto & eastman ( @xcite ) try to explain these secondary maxima as due to the distribution of material in the inner core of the explosion , possibly connected to the explosion mechanism .",
    "if this is the case , then the detailed study of the bolometric light curves and their differences among individual sne  ia might provide a direct `` window '' into the explosion .    with the currently best available distances we find that the peak luminosities of the sne  ia in our sample display a rather large range .",
    "they imply a factor of 2.5 in the masses .",
    "sn  1991bg produced about 8 times less than the brightest object , sn  1992bc .",
    "the range of nickel masses indicates significant differences in the explosions of sne  ia . from the late - phase decline",
    ", we find that the change of the decline rate is rather uniform indicating similarity in change of the @xmath2ray escape fraction for all sne  ia independent of the amount of nickel produced in the explosion ."
