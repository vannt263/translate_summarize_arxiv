    "to solve flow equations depending on an external momentum the computational strategy is as follows :    * mapping the @xmath151 flow to a forward time evolution problem by introducing @xmath152 .",
    "* discretization of the problem by approximating  @xmath153 with an interpolation function that is determined by  @xmath154 support points",
    ". these are best chosen to be equidistant on a logarithmic scale , accounting for the expectation that a wide range of scales should contribute in a comparable way to the integral . * for now , we have been using interpolation in conjunction with the two - dimensional integration function ` scipy.integrate.dblquad ( ) ` from scientific python .",
    "however , this ad - hoc approach should allow great efficiency improvements by instead considering a tighter integration of numerical quadrature with adaptive discretization .",
    "in particular , it should then also be possible to also pass on information about the discretized flow equation s jacobian matrix to the numerical ode integrator .",
    "there hence is considerable potential for further efficiency improvements of numerical rg flow code . * solving the resulting ordinary differential equation for the values of @xmath153 at the support points with scipy s  ` scipy.integrate.odeint ( ) ` function ( which internally uses  ` lsoda ` from  ` odepack ` ) .    concerning the numerical solution of the ode , some manual tweaking of integration parameters such as maximal step sizes",
    "is required when the coupling constant  @xmath155 is large and  @xmath156 .",
    "we note that , by the very nature of this problem , the computation is readily parallelized : the effort to numerically determine the right hand side integral is expected to roughly grow like  @xmath157 with the number  @xmath154 of support points , and computations for different support points are independent . in comparison to the computational effort required to compute the integrals ,",
    "the communication overhead to distribute the values of  @xmath153 at different support points is fairly negligible , hence using one of the readily available mpi - extensions to python to intelligently distribute the workload becomes an attractive option .",
    "one should , however , take care that the core structure of the integrand then is implemented in a compiled ( c code ) python extension before even thinking about parallelization .",
    "the numerical calculations of @xmath121 in the main text use a grid of @xmath158 points in the direction of @xmath159 , distributed equidistantly on a logarithmic scale .",
    "the result for @xmath160 is interpolated with splines to calculate the propagator  @xmath95",
    ". a discreet fourier transformation of @xmath95 yields the correlator @xmath161 on the interval @xmath162 $ ] with @xmath163 intermediate points . in the main text",
    "we have used @xmath164 . from its large distance behavior",
    "@xmath100 the correlator mass @xmath165 is determined by a least square fit .",
    "the fit range is constrained to the interval @xmath166 $ ] where the contributions of excited states are negligible .",
    "the value of @xmath167 is determined such that @xmath168 shows a plateau .",
    "we can either fit on the whole range @xmath166 $ ]  this quantity is called @xmath169  or make the fit just inside a small interval of size 0.2 starting from @xmath170  this quantity is called @xmath171 .    in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : effmasslam06 ] @xmath172 is shown for two different discretisations of @xmath173 , @xmath174 in the upper and @xmath175 in the lower panel . in the right panel the same is shown for @xmath169 . from these plots",
    "we can read off that for @xmath167 not too large there is a clear plateau which is stable if the box size is increased .",
    "but for very large @xmath167 the local mass oscillates .",
    "as this oscillation is reduced if the discretization is increased it is due to fluctuations in the spline interpolation of @xmath121 . at small values of the correlator",
    "the numerical errors are more important for the masses .",
    "as the fluctuations become visible for large box sizes , in these cases the global mass fit is of no use because it averages over the local mass and is strongly influenced by the oscillations .",
    "we will therefore take the plateau of @xmath171 as the value of the renormalized mass .",
    "in perturbation theory the mass is determined from the one particle irreducible ( proper ) vertex @xmath176 .",
