    "it is generally recognized that the standard black - scholes option pricing model is inconsistent with options data , while still being used in practice because of its simplicity and the existence of tractable solutions .",
    "exponential lvy models generalize the classical black - scholes setup by allowing jumps in stock prices while preserving the independence and the stationarity of returns .",
    "there are several reasons for introducing jumps in financial modeling .",
    "first of all , sudden sharp shifts in the price level of financial assets often occur in practice , and these  jumps \" are hard to handled within continuous - paths models .",
    "second , the empirical returns of financial assets typically exhibit distributions with heavy tails and high kurtosis , which again are hard to replicate within purely - continuous frameworks .",
    "finally , market prices of vanilla options display skewed implied volatilities ( relative to changes in the strikes ) , in contrast to the classical black - scholes model which predicts a flat implied volatility smile .",
    "moreover , the fact that the implied volatility smile and skewness phenomena become much more pronounced for short maturities is a clear indication of the need for jumps in the underlying models used to price options .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for further motivations on the use of jump processes in financial modeling .",
    "one of the first applications of jump processes in financial modeling originates with  @xcite , who suggested a pure - jump stable lvy process to model power - like tails and self - similar behavior in cotton price returns .",
    "@xcite and @xcite subsequently considered option pricing and hedging problems under an exponential compound poisson process with gaussian jumps and an additive independent non - zero brownian component .",
    "a similar exponential compound poisson jump - diffusion model was more recently studied in @xcite , where the jump sizes are distributed according to an asymmetric laplace law . for infinite activity exponential lvy models , @xcite introduced the normal inverse gaussian ( nig ) model , while the extension to the generalized hyperbolic class was studied by @xcite .",
    "@xcite introduced the symmetric variance gamma ( vg ) model while its asymmetric extension was later analyzed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "both models are built on brownian subordination ; the main difference being that the log - return process in the nig model is an infinite variation process with cauchy - like behavior of small jumps , while in the vg model the log - price is of finite variation with infinite but relatively low activity of small jumps .",
    "the class of  truncated stable \" processes was first introduced by @xcite .",
    "it was advocated for financial modeling by @xcite and @xcite , and was further developed in the context of asset price modeling by @xcite , who introduced the terminology cgmy .",
    "nowadays , the cgmy model is considered to be a prototype of the general class of models with jumps and enjoys widespread applicability .",
    "the cgmy model is a particular case of the more general kobol class of @xcite , which in turn is a subclass of the semi - parametric class of tempered stable processes ( tsps ) introduced by @xcite .",
    "tsps form a rich class with appealing features for financial modeling .",
    "one of their most interesting features lies in their short - time and long - time behaviors . indeed , denoting by @xmath8 the index of a tsp , @xmath9",
    ", it follows that @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a strictly @xmath3-stable lvy process and @xmath12 denotes convergence in distribution .",
    "in fact , ( [ srbtsp ] ) holds when @xmath13 provided @xmath14 is driftless , while it holds when @xmath15 regardless of the mean of @xmath14 .",
    "roughly , ( [ srbtsp ] ) suggests that the short - time behavior of tsp is akin to that of a stable process , with its heavy - tailed distribution and self - similarity property which are desirable for financial modeling as emphasized , for example , by @xcite .",
    "in contrast , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a brownian motion , which suggests that in the long - horizon , the process is brownian - like . in terms of increments",
    ", if we were to consider the consecutive  high - frequency \" increments of the process @xmath14 , say @xmath18 with @xmath19 , these will exhibit statistical features consistent with those of a self - similar stable time series .",
    "but , low - frequency increments , say @xmath20 with @xmath21 , will have gaussian like distributions .",
    "stemming in part from their importance for model calibration and testing , small - time asymptotics of option prices have received a lot of attention in recent years ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "reviewed here are only the studies most closely related to ours , focusing in particular on the at - the - money ( atm ) case .",
    "@xcite first analyzed , partially via heuristic arguments , the first - order asymptotic behavior of an it semimartingale with jumps .",
    "concretely , @xcite argued that atm option prices of pure - jump models of bounded variation decrease at the rate @xmath22 , while they are just @xmath23 in the presence of a brownian component . by analyzing the particular case of a stable pure - jump component , @xcite also argued that , for other cases , the rate could be @xmath24 for some @xmath25 .",
    "@xcite formally showed that , in the presence of a continuous - time component , the leading term of atm option prices is of order @xmath26 , for a relatively broad class of it models , while for a type of it processes with @xmath27-stable - like small jumps and @xmath28 , the leading term is @xmath29 ( see also  ( * ? ? ?",

    ", it is impossible to discern the difference between @xmath41 and @xmath42 at this second - order approximation .",
    "in contrast , in the pure - jump case ( i.e. , @xmath59 in ( [ cgmy1stdfn ] ) ) , the degree of jump activity of the lvy process is already present in the first - order term . as a byproduct of our asymptotic results for atm option prices",
    ", we also give the asymptotic behavior of the corresponding atm black - scholes implied volatility , denoted by @xmath82 .",

    "however , @xmath88 and the argument fails after taking expectations .",
    "our derivation is fully probabilistic and builds on two facts .",
    "first , make use of the following model - free representation due to @xcite : @xmath89}=\\mathbb{p}^{*}\\left(x_{t}>e\\right)=\\int_{0}^{\\infty}e^{-x}\\mathbb{p}^{*}\\left(x_{t}>x\\right)dx,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 is the martingale probability measure obtained when one takes the stock as the numraire ( i.e. , @xmath91 for every @xmath92 , @xmath93 ) and @xmath94 is an independent mean - one exponential random variable under @xmath90 .",
    "the measure @xmath90 is also called the share measure ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "second , further change the probability measure @xmath95 to another probability measure , say @xmath96 , under which the pure jump - component of @xmath81 becomes a stable lvy process , independent of the continuous component of @xmath81 .",
    "this change , in turn , enables to exploit some key features of stable processes such as self - similarity and the asymptotic behavior of their marginal densities .",
    "let us finish this introductory section with a brief digression on the relevance as well as further extensions and applications of our results :    * lvy models are often criticized for their partial ability to fit volatility surfaces across maturities and to account for some stylized features of stock prices such as volatility clustering .",
    "a natural question is then whether the results hereafter can be extended to more complex models .",
    "the short answer is  yes \" .",
    "even though a complete exposition of this point is beyond the scope of the present manuscript , the reason can be broadly justified here .",
    "this has its origins in the work of @xcite , where first - order asymptotics of atm option prices for a relatively general martingale process with jumps and stochastic volatility are obtained by first showing the analog for a suitable class of lvy models and then proving that the option prices under the general model can be closely approximated by those of a suitably chosen lvy model in the class .",
    "it is therefore expected that our second - order expansions will be valid for a much more general class of it models satisfying certain regularity conditions .",
    "thus , for instance , it is expected that ( [ asyivgercgmy0 ] ) will hold with @xmath4 replaced with the spot volatility at time @xmath97 , say @xmath98 , which itself can be random depending on an additional risky factor such as in the heston model .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for more details about the latter type of results . * from a qualitative point of view , the short - time expansions stated here allow to connect information of the model s parameters to key features of the option prices and the implied volatility smile and , at a more basic level , to identify ( and rank ) the parameters ( or numerical features of functional parameters ) that most influence the behavior of the option prices and implied volatilities in short - time . hence , for instance , ( [ asyivgercgmy0 ] ) asserts that , under a continuous component and an infinite stable - like jump activity component , the most important feature that determines the short - time behavior of the implied volatility , below the spot volatility @xmath4 , is the intensity of small - jumps as measured by @xmath80",
    ". moreover , this influence is `` felt at the rate '' @xmath99 , which is much stronger than how the jump features start to be  felt \" in the case of a finite jump activity , where the rate is of order @xmath100 ( see remark [ compmedsca ] below ) . * from a quantitative point of view , as already mentioned , short - time asymptotics of option prices are relevant in model testing and calibration .",
    "the first type of application is already present in the seminal work of @xcite . for the second type of application , high - order expansions , as the ones obtained here , can facilitate numerical calibration by suggesting , for instance , proper functional forms for extrapolation purposes or for setting starting points of numerical calibration methods .",
    "we refer to remark [ moreoncalibration ] below for more information about this latter type of application .",
