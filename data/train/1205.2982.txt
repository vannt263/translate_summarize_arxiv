    "any lower seshadri constant must then be induced by an irreducible seshadri curve and the rest of the proof is merely to find out the different intersection properties of these . the same approach would of course also work if the curves with a point of maximal expected multiplicity were elements of @xmath313 for @xmath314 , and also if the maximal expected multiplicity is @xmath315 .",
