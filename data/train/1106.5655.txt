    "on the one hand , the interaction is stronger , even a bound state , the deuteron , can be formed .",
    "this would lead to higher transition temperatures and the transition from cooper pairing to bose - einstein condensation . on the other hand , with increasing difference of the chemical potentials and increasing coulomb effects",
    ", the formation of a condensate becomes more difficult , in particular in asymmetric matter .",
    "the strong interaction in the isospin - singlet channel leads to a precursor for the bose condensate , the occurrence of a pseudogap @xcite above the critical temperature .",
    "furthermore , pairing competes with the formation of an @xmath7-particle condensate ( quartetting ) @xcite , in particular at low densities .",
    "therefore , the role of correlations , in particular the formation of clusters and of a quantum condensate , is an interesting item in strongly interacting quantum liquids such as nuclear matter .",
    "systematic quantum statistical approaches , see @xcite , have to be used for a treatment using appropriate concepts such as thermodynamic green functions , spectral function , and self - energy . within a chemical picture , a cluster decomposition of the self - energy can be performed that considers the formation of clusters in a dense medium , taking into account symmetrization ( pauli blocking ) , screening of the interaction , dynamical self - energy , and other many - particle effects .",
    "an interesting approximation is the cluster mean - field approximation @xcite that considers the few - particle schrdinger equation in a correlated medium , where the correlations in the medium have to be determined in a self - consistent way .",
    "this would allow to describe nuclear matter in a wide range of densities , from saturation density where a mean - field approach on the single nucleon level is possible , to the low - density region where the nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) applies and @xmath7-matter can occur .",
    "we discuss the formation of clusters in nuclear matter in sec .",
    "2 and give some applications to finite nuclei in sec .",
    "the few - body problem describing @xmath8 nucleons in hot and dense matter can be related to an in - medium wave equation ( bethe - salpeter equation ) that is derived from many - particle approaches , see ref .",

    "the in - medium schrdinger equation ( [ wavea ] ) contains the effects of the medium in the single nucleon quasiparticle shift as well as in the pauli blocking terms .",
    "obviously , the bound state wave functions and energy eigenvalues as well as the scattering phase shifts depend on temperature and density .",
    "in particular , we obtain the cluster quasiparticle shifts @xmath26    the contribution of the single nucleon energy shift to the cluster self - energy shift @xmath27 is easily calculated in the effective mass approximation , where the single - nucleon quasiparticle energy shift @xmath28 can be represented by the energy shift @xmath29 and the effective mass @xmath30 , see @xcite .",
    "different expressions for the single - nucleon quasiparticle shifts are available such as skyrme , rmf , or dbhf , see @xcite .",

    "it is possible to evaluate the composition of warm nuclear matter at arbitrary baryon density @xmath45 below the saturation density , temperature @xmath5 , and proton fraction @xmath46 . equations of state can be obtained for different thermodynamic properties , see also @xcite . a smooth transition from the description of nuclear matter near saturation density to the low density region",

    "with increasing density , the self - energy shift leads to the behavior @xmath47 at @xmath48 that means thermodynamical instability . with the disappearance of the bound states , the internal energy approaches the values for the quasiparticle single - nucleon approximation",
    "this occurs rather abruptly near @xmath49 @xmath50 so that an intermediate region of metastability appears .",
    "however , this may be changed if better approximations for the internal energy in the intermediate region are available .",
    "alternative approaches to the internal energy of symmetric matter at @xmath48 have been considered in connection with the formation of a quantum condensate @xcite .",

    "nuclear matter at low densities and temperatures is thermodynamically instable .",
    "this region of phase instability can only be reached in nonequilibrium or in inhomogeneous systems .",
    "an interesting application are nuclei , where nuclear systems at low densities can occur .",
    "in particular , excited states of symmetric 4@xmath32 nuclei near the @xmath52 threshold may show an @xmath7 cluster state such as in @xmath53be , @xmath54c , possibly @xmath55o , and others . as a simple ansatz to describe @xmath56 clusters with the same c.o.m .",
    "orbits , like the pairing state , the thsr wave function was introduced @xcite .",
    "this wave function is a product ansatz for the c.o.m .",
    "motion of antisymmetrized @xmath7 clusters , similar to the bcs wave function .",
    "this approach has been proven to describe different properties of such low - density states successfully .    in particular , a relation between the density and",
    "the condensate fraction has been discussed @xcite that indicates the disappearence of the condensate around @xmath57 .",
    "whereas @xmath7 clusters are well developed in the hoyle state , in the ground state of @xmath54c no @xmath7 clustering is present and a quasiparticle single - nucleon shell model is applicable .",
    "the reason is the antisymmetrization of the nucleonic wave functions that results in the pauli blocking .",
    "in contrast to the calculations shown in fig .",
    "1 , where the pauli blocking is caused by uncorrelated nucleons that form a fermi sphere , the pauli blocking by a clustered medium is less efficient because the nucleonic wave function is more distributed in momentum space . therefore , we expect that the crossover from @xmath7 matter behavior , given by a cluster - virial expansion , to the quasiparticle nucleonic liquids happens not near @xmath58 @xmath50 , but near @xmath59 @xmath50 so that a continuous decrease is expected",
    ". then , the intermediate region of metastability where @xmath60 would disappear .",
    "the behavior of the quasiparticle shift @xmath61 , eq .",
    "( [ quasi ] ) , is sensitive to the values of self - energy shift and pauli blocking that partially compensate . at zero temperature ,",
    "the self - energy shift amounts about -4000  @xmath32 mev fm@xmath11 , whereas the pauli blocking term is larger than 4434  @xmath32 mev fm@xmath11 as given for @xmath63 mev in @xcite . if we estimate the kinetic energy of the nucleons bound in the @xmath7 particle as @xmath64 = 51",
    ". 6 mev @xcite and simulate the corresponding occupation in momentum space by an effective temperature @xmath65 , the pauli blocking shift is reduced by a factor 2 so that the total quasiparticle energy shift becomes negative , around -2000  @xmath32 mev fm@xmath11 at @xmath48 .",
    "a decrease of the internal energy follows also from the cluster virial expansion @xcite that gives about -1500  @xmath32 mev fm@xmath11 at @xmath63 mev .",
    "this value is only based on empirical @xmath66 scattering phase shits .",
    "the ali - bodmer interaction , which is also based on these phase shifts , has been considered in @xcite to calculate the @xmath7 condensate fraction at @xmath48 .",
    "also a decrease of internal energy was found .",
    "exploratory lattice calculations for a @xmath48 @xmath7 condensate state @xcite gave no definite answer .",
    "whereas for @xmath12he an increase of energy with increasing density was obtained , the opposite occurs for @xmath55o .",
    "another interesting region where @xmath7 clustering is expected to occur is the surface of nuclei . like pairing that is increasing near the surface",
    "@xcite where the density drops down from the saturation value , also @xmath7 clustering and possibly quartetting can occur . a simple way to incorporate",
    "this is a local density approach .",
    "estimations of the role of isospin - singlet pairing and quartetting for nuclei near the @xmath67 line have been given in @xcite analysing binding energies of the ground state and of the excited state .",
    "the wigner energy can be explained this way .",
    "this effect is seen in the light nuclei where the shift of the proton chemical potential due to the coulomb energy is not strong compared to the condensation energy .",
    "cluster formation at the surface of nuclei is of interest also in the region of superheavy elements . as well known , the most dominant decay channel is @xmath7 decay , in contrast to the emission of protons or neutrons .",
    "therefore one expects that @xmath7 particles are preformed in the skin of the superheavies where the density drops down .",
    "a corresponding picture is a stable core such as the double magic lead or uranium nucleus , surrounded by a skin of nucleons at reduced density where cluster formation is possible .",
    "of course , the pauli blocking mechanism has to be considered beyond the local density approximation , considering the density matrix due to the core orbitals .",
    "we discuss two consequences of clustering in the skin of superheavies , the binding energy and the rms radii .",
    "further signatures can be seen in reaction processes .",
    "the staggering of the binding energies of superheavies is well known from experimental data .",
    "it would be of interest to what extent this staggering can be explained within a quasiparticle single - nucleon approach such as shell calculations , or using a thsr - like wave function that describes the c.o.m .",
    "motion of antisymmetrized clusters .",
    "another effect are the rms radii of superheavy elements .",
    "experimentally , the charge radii @xmath68 are measured .",
    "the calculated values are the point radii @xmath69 that consider point - like nucleons .",
    "the relation between both is given by the relation @xcite @xmath70 that takes into account the contribution of the proton form factor due to its spatial extension , @xmath71 fm@xmath10 , and the neutron contribution @xmath73 fm@xmath10 .",
    "if we assume that the surface is formed by @xmath7-like clusters , we expect another relation , @xmath74 with the charge rms radius for the @xmath56 particle , @xmath75 fm@xmath10 .",
    "assuming that the point rms radii are nearly the same , the effect of @xmath7-clustering would increase the rms radius according @xmath76 fm@xmath10 .",
    "for instance , considering a heavy nucleus with @xmath77^{1/2}=6 $ ] fm , the charge rms radius would be larger by 2.98 % if the @xmath7 cluster determine the surface , compared to the usual nucleonic surface .",
    "the empirical values of charge rms radii of nuclei @xcite have been compared with hartree - fock bogoliubov shell model calculations @xcite , and excellent agreement has been found with exception of the superheavies like cm where the measured values of the charge rms radii are about 2 % higher than the calculated ones . an interesting point would be whether the difference can be explained by clustering . assuming this , @xmath7 emitters should have an expanded charge rms radius , compared to quasiparticle single - nucleon calculations ."
