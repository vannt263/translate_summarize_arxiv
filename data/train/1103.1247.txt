    "<S> in this article we investigate the linear - chain spin - half @xmath0@xmath1 model by using high - order coupled cluster method ( ccm ) calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we employ three model states , namely , a nearest - neighbour ( n.n . ) nel model state in which neighbouring spins are antiparallel , a next - nearest - neighbour ( n.n.n . ) nel model state in which next - neighbouring spins are antiparallel , and finally a type of `` double spiral '' model state with _ two _ pitch angles . for @xmath2 , we find that the n.n . nel model state produces the lowest energies . for @xmath3 , we find that the stable states for the quantum system are those for the `` traditional '' spiral state in which the two pitch angles are identical and the collinear n.n.n . </S>",

    "<S> we show that the onset of the dimerised phase is indicated by a bifurcation of the nearest - neighbour ket- and bra - state correlation coefficients for the nearest - neighbour nel model state . </S>",

    "<S> model states are in good agreement with the results of exact diagonalisations of finite - length chains across this entire regime for @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we produce results for the dimer order parameter for @xmath6 by using the n.n.n . </S>",

    "<S> finally , results for the spin - spin correlation functions for the n.n.n . </S>",
    "<S> nel model state are presented . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the correlation length increases with increasing @xmath7 above @xmath4 using this model state and that shift in the peak of the structure function occurs from @xmath8 to @xmath9 as one increases @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> although these results are not conclusive , they are intriguing because they suggest that a ground state exhibiting collinear order might occur for some region for @xmath10 . </S>"
