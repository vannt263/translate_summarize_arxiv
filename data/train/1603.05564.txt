    "the constitutive characterization of partially saturated porous media became of interest at the beginning of the last century when scientific research started to face fundamental problems in geotechnics and petroleum engineering , concerning modeling the response of partially imbibed soils , during imbibition / drainage cycles ( see @xcite ) , or modeling the behavior of sedimentary reservoir rocks , when a multi - phase fluid flows through the porous network . starting from the analysis of basic static problems , it became clear that the balance between capillary and driving forces , in particular gravitational forces , would have been the central subject of modeling efforts . this pushed the research in the direction of finding out simple relations between the curvature of the wetting / non - wetting fluid interface and the average content of the wetting fluid , over a suitably defined representative volume element ( rve ) .",
    "the main ideas of this identification have been clearly sketched by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 6 ) for a partially saturated truncated conical pore , specifying the infinitesimal variation of the interfacial energy in terms of the infinitesimal variation of the volume occupied by the wetting fluid ( saturation ) .",
    "this naturally provided the well - known definition of macro - scale capillary pressure , as the derivative of a macro - scale capillary energy . in @xcite , @xcite , in the summarizing contribution by @xcite , in @xcite etc . , different semi - empirical relations , between macro - scale capillary pressure and saturation have been stated , in order to specify the retention properties of the porous skeleton .",
    "these retention curves typically exhibit hysteresis during imbibition / drainage cycles , so as to fit with experimental evidence .    at the same time the pioneering papers by cahn and",
    "hilliard @xcite established the basic framework within which modeling of multi - phase fluid flow is formulated in terms of space and time evolution of the mass concentration or , in the general case , of a phase field which can vary continuously over thin interfacial layers . beyond the original formulation due to",
    "@xcite one can refer to @xcite and @xcite for general reviews , as well as to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "surface tension is recovered , in this context , considering the integral , through the thickness of the layer , of the concentration gradient ( or the gradient of the phase field ) .",
    "this approach progressively attracted more and more interest , in particular within the framework of fluid mechanics , because of its advantages for numerical calculations which do not necessitate adaptive interface fitting grids , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "surprisingly however limited contributions attempted at incorporating these ideas into modeling of unsaturated porous media , one can refer for instance to @xcite and @xcite and more recently to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this paper follows the research path traced by these authors to model partially saturated deformable porous media , considering the pore network infused with a two - phase fluid .",
    "also the constitutive characterization of the solid will be generalized with respect to the classical poromechanical model , in order to describe the coupling between highly localized flows and ( possibly localized ) strains .    for long time",
    "the above mentioned constitutive characterization of the macro - scale capillary pressure in terms of the corresponding hysteretic retention curve has been the only relation used for describing the hydraulic flow through partially saturated porous media , being also the pivot of the hydro - mechanical coupling with the constitutive law of the porous skeleton . due to the coarse simplification provided by this model ,",
    "however , it was finally recognized the existence of several problems in which the relation between capillary pressure and saturation is not sufficient to describe at the same time surface tension , between the wetting and the non - wetting fluid , and the retention properties of the porous skeleton , due to its texture . as a matter of fact",
    "what is understood by this constitutive law is , as already mentioned , that no variation of the capillary pressure can be observed if no change of the saturation is induced by external forces .",
    "this is due to the rough upscaling rule , from the micro to the macro - scale , which assumes the variation of the area of interfaces proportional to the volume occupied by the fluids , see @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "as originally pointed out by @xcite , redistribution of the fluids within a porous medium can occur also keeping constant the saturation , and instabilities can even arise from fluid interfaces that are unable to change curvature smoothly with variations in pressure ( haines jumps ) .",
    "in other words , different micro - scale configurations of interfaces between a wetting and a non - wetting phase are possible for a given saturation .    in more refined macro - scale formulations",
    "the specific cumulative measure of interfaces , between the wetting and the non - wetting phase , say the specific interfacial area , is also introduced to account for the micro - scale features of the fluids within the rve , see @xcite and the related literature , _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite . in order to clarify the meaning of this additional macro - scale state parameter",
    ", one can think of the effect of the saturation degree , on the macro - scale capillary pressure , as that which coarsely accounts for the retention characteristics of the porous skeleton , depending on its texture , and consider on the other hand the effect of the cumulative measure of interfaces as a suitable corrective term , which allows for describing different admissible coexistence configurations of the saturating fluids . within this framework ,",
    "several experimental campaigns have been carried out , based on laboratory tests , see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite , and also pore network micro - scale numerical simulations have been implemented , see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite , in order to characterize the constitutive relation among capillary pressure , saturation and specific interfacial area .",
    "consider now the behavior of the porous skeleton , it is almost standard in continuum poromechanics to introduce a constitutive prescription of stress in terms of strain and saturation , both in the case of elastic and elasto - plastic deformations ; one can refer among others to the seminal paper by @xcite and the related literature , see _",
    "@xcite , to the systematic formulation by @xcite , see also @xcite , to the approach based on the generalized bishop effective stress , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite etc . , or to some recent contributions within the range of finite deformations of the porous skeleton , see @xcite and @xcite",
    ". possible modifications of these constitutive models , in order to account for the effect of the specific interfacial area , concern the improvement of the retention curve provided within the approach to multi - phase mechanics proposed by @xcite , in which velocities of phases and interfaces are employed to describe fluid flow and skeleton deformation , see also @xcite . within this framework , however , several phenomena , related to micro - structure remodeling , can not be captured , exactly as several phenomena related to the spatial distribution of fluids within the pores could not be described only in terms of saturation evolution .",
    "the typical case is that of localized deformations which have been observed in laboratory scale experimental tests , since the beginning of the 70s , initially using medical scanners for imaging sand bodies , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite and @xcite , and later with the aid of rx computerized tomography and digital image correlation , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite etc .",
    "thanks to the improvements in the resolving power of tomographs as well as to the progressively increasing skills of scientists in the treatment of experimental data , dry and ( partially ) saturated specimens have been imaged under triaxial loading conditions to observe localized deformations and porosity change , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite and @xcite .    in order to model the effects at the scale of the specimen of these micro - scale grain displacements , and",
    "in particular to obtain the regularization of localized deformation patterns , the gradient theory of elasto - plasticity , as well as the gradient approach to damage and fracture mechanics , have been adopted in the literature .",
    "typical references are @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , as well as @xcite and @xcite . in all these cases",
    "however the hydro - mechanical coupling , if any , still remains restricted to the constitutive prescription of the effective or net stress , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite and @xcite .    as already mentioned , in this paper a novel general approach is developed , within the framework of continuum poromechanics , which aims at merging phase field modeling of multi - phase fluid flow with unsaturated strain gradient poromechanics .",
    "while the standard retention curve is expected still to provide the intrinsic retention properties of the porous skeleton , depending on the porous texture , an enhanced description of surface tension between the wetting and the non - wetting fluid , occupying the pore space , is stated considering a regularized phase field model ( in the sense of @xcite ) .",
    "similarly to the model which introduces the specific interfacial area as a corrective term of the standard retention curve , this alternative formulation allows for detecting variations of capillary forces even when no change in saturation is caused by the external loading .",
    "indeed a similar approach has already been addressed in the literature , attempting at modeling gravitational fingering and saturation overshooting , through an undeformable porous skeleton , or viscous fingering through a hele - shaw cell , see @xcite .",
    "however no account has been taken of the possible coupling with the deformations of the porous skeleton . in the model which is going to be presented in this paper ,",
    "on the other hand , the behavior of the solid skeleton is described by means of a strain gradient model , to predict localized strains and fracture , when considering irreversible processes . to the best of author",
    "s knowledge , no general model accounting for both the above mentioned items , say localization in fluid flow and strain , can be retrieved from the literature , except a preliminary study by the author @xcite , stemming from previous results on modeling of porous media saturated by quasi - incompressible fluids , see @xcite and @xcite . within this enhanced framework , the hydro - mechanical coupling is therefore responsible not only for the effects of average variations of the hydraulic regime within the rve on the skeleton deformation , and vice - versa , see among others @xcite , but it can also account for the effects of capillary fingering on damaging and fracturing of the skeleton and vice - versa for the effects of strain localization on permeability variations and heterogeneous / anisotropic fluid flow .    the paper is organized as follows : in section 1 the basics of kinematics of ( partially ) saturated porous media are summarized . in section 2 the expression of the virtual working of external forces , relative to a second gradient multi - phase continuum , is manipulated to obtain the virtual working of internal forces , which is consistent with the balance of the overall momentum . in section 3",
    "the first and the second principle of thermodynamics are introduced in order to get the generalized form of the clausius - duhem inequality , prescribing the solid , fluid and thermal dissipations . in section 4 ,",
    "the constitutive laws for the effective stress and hyper - stress are established , considering the contribution of strain and saturation gradients to the overall free energy of the porous continuum ; the generalized darcy law is also deduced .",
    "section 5 is devoted to discuss the properties of the so - called pore - fluid , constitutively characterized in terms of a suitable double well potential , specifying the two phases of the fluid within the pores . in section 6",
    "the generalized prescription of the macro - scale capillary pressure is placed , accounting for its dependence on the saturation gradient . in section 7",
    "the governing equations , say the overall balance law and the generalized darcy law , are deduced by means of a variational approach which also provides the proper boundary conditions . finally in section 8",
    "some conclusions are stated .",
    "a macroscopic description of kinematics is adopted , treating the partially saturated porous medium as the superposition of a skeleton and a binary mixture of liquid water and wet air .",
    "the current placement of the skeleton particles is provided by the deformation of a reference configuration @xmath0 .",
    "the partial saturation of the pore space is accounted for thinking of the fluid mixture as a non - uniform fluid in the sense of @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ a fluid possibly having a spatial variation in one of its intensive scalar properties .",
    "let @xmath1 be the @xmath2-th component of the deformation ( placement ) of the skeleton particles with respect to a fixed orthonormal frame in the euclidean space @xmath3 of positions ; @xmath0 is the reference configuration of the solid constituent and @xmath4 a time interval .",
    "the image of @xmath0 under the deformation map is the current configuration of the porous medium , say @xmath5 .",
    "moreover let @xmath6 indicate the displacement of the solid particles , @xmath7 the deformation gradient , along the @xmath8-th direction of an orthonormal frame in the reference configuration of the solid , and @xmath9 the associated strain tensor , @xmath10 being the kronecker delta .",
    "from now on greek indices label the components of any @xmath11-th order tensor with respect to a frame in the euclidean space , whilst latin indices label the components of any @xmath11-th order tensor with respect to a frame into the reference configuration of the skeleton @xmath0 . finally let @xmath12 be the @xmath2-th component of the velocity of the skeleton particles .",
    "as usual within the framework of poromechanics , the notions of eulerian porosity @xmath11 and lagrangian porosity @xmath13 are introduced , as the current pore volume density per unit volume of the porous continuum , and the current pore volume density per unit reference volume , respectively . clearly @xmath14 ; @xmath15 being the determinant of @xmath16 .    concerning the non - uniform fluid the intensive scalar property , used from now on to characterize the biphasic characteristic of the fluid , is not the mass concentration but the volume density of the liquid phase with respect to the volume of the pores , say the degree of saturation",
    ". the liquid phase of the mixture ( water ) is assumed incompressible and the gaseous phase ( wet air ) is assumed to be passive ( that is , have infinite mobility ) so that its density can be neglected with respect to that of the liquid , @xmath17 ; the apparent density of the fluid mixture , say the mass density of the non - uniform fluid per unit volume of the porous medium , is therefore definitely prescribed in terms of the volumetric liquid content @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath19 indicates the saturation degree ( saturation ratio ) , measuring the current volume occupied by the liquid per unit volume of the pores , the liquid content is @xmath20 and the fluid apparent density is @xmath21 .",
    "the saturation degree ranges within the interval @xmath22 $ ] , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 indicate the gaseous and the liquid phase , respectively .",
    "the kinematics of the non - uniform fluid is specified as in @xcite ; the reference placement of the non - uniform fluid particles is therefore prescribed by means of a regular map @xmath25 defined on the reference configuration of the skeleton .",
    "it identifies the fluid material particle within a reference domain @xmath26 , which occupies , at time @xmath27 , the same current place as the solid particle , chosen in @xmath0 . accordingly",
    "the fluid velocity coincides with the time derivative of @xmath28 , which means for every reference particle @xmath29 and every current place @xmath30 : @xmath31 where @xmath32 ; the einstein summation for repeated indices is understood in equation .",
    "similarly to the deformation gradient of the solid skeleton also the gradient of @xmath33 can be defined in terms of the gradient of @xmath34 and @xmath35 as @xmath36 .",
    "both the saturation degree and the liquid content are naturally defined on the current configuration of the porous medium , however the corresponding pull - back in the reference configuration of the skeleton can easily be defined by means of the inverse of the deformation map @xmath37 .",
    "the mass conservation of the fluid mixture can be stated , following @xcite , in the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the lagrangian fluid mass content and @xmath40 is the lagrangian filtration vector ; the time derivative is computed keeping fixed the reference placement of the solid particle . according with previous remarks ,",

    "it is worth to underline that even if the liquid is incompressible the non - uniform fluid is not , consequently no restriction on the fluid velocity is placed .",
    "here an approach much similar to that developed by @xcite is adopted , in order to deduce the strain working relative to a porous medium within the framework of gradient continuum mechanics .",
    "starting from the standard formulation of the mechanics of superimposed continua , and using the almost classical formulation of gradient theories introduced by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , the external working of the solid - fluid mixture is defined as a continuous linear functional of the velocity fields @xmath43 and @xmath44 : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the boundary of the current configuration of the porous continuum , assumed differentiable almost everywhere , and @xmath47 is the union of the edges of @xmath46 , on which the normal @xmath48 to the boundary suffers a jump .",
    "equation implies that not only bulk forces @xmath49 and surface tractions @xmath50 , but also double forces @xmath51 and tractions per unit line @xmath52 on both constituents @xmath53 , are expected to be be balanced by proper internal tractions .",

    "thinking of the pure solid , double forces generalize the concept of skew - symmetric couples , which is typical of cosserat or couple - stress theories , bearing into account not only surface density of moment but also surface density of symmetric couples .",
    "the former , working on a combination of differential shearing , bending and torsion , the latter , on differential elongation . on the other hand , thinking of non - viscous but non - uniform fluids , characterized by internal capillarity , say cahn - hilliard fluids , double forces are associated only to symmetric couples working on differential liquid content or , within our framework , saturation ratio , which allows to describe surface tension effects , see _",

    "<S> a poromechanical model of partially saturated deformable porous media is proposed based on a phase field approach at modeling the behavior of the mixture of liquid water and wet air , which saturates the pore space , the phase field being the saturation ( ratio ) . while the standard retention curve is expected still to provide the intrinsic retention properties of the porous skeleton , depending on the porous texture , </S>",
    "<S> an enhanced description of surface tension between the wetting ( liquid water ) and the non - wetting ( wet air ) fluid , occupying the pore space , is stated considering a regularization of the phase field model based on an additional contribution to the overall free energy depending on the saturation gradient . </S>",
    "<S> the aim is to provide a more refined description of surface tension interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> an enhanced constitutive relation for the capillary pressure is established together with a suitable generalization of darcy s law , in which the gradient of the capillary pressure is replaced by the gradient of the so - called generalized chemical potential , which also accounts for the force associated to the local free energy of the phase field model . </S>",
    "<S> a micro - scale heuristic interpretation of the novel constitutive law of capillary pressure is proposed , in order to compare the envisaged model with that one endowed with the concept of average interfacial area .    the considered poromechanical model is formulated within the framework of strain gradient theory in order to account for possible effects , at laboratory scale , of the micro - scale hydro - mechanical couplings between highly - localized flows ( fingering ) and localized deformations of the skeleton ( fracturing ) </S>",
