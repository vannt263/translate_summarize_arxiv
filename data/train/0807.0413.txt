    "in superfluid helium , vortices form when the helium is rotated rapidly or when there is turbulence @xcite .",
    "though such vortices are similar to the vortices that make up a vortex street behind the wings of an airplane or to the funnel clouds of tornadoes , they are only an angstrom or two across @xcite .",
    "a more essential difference is that the vortices in a superfluid do not need a constant source of energy to survive .",
    "in fact , a vortex is long - lived because the strength of its flow is fixed by the quantization of angular momentum .",
    "thus , the dissipative mechanisms of a conventional fluid are absent .    in this article",
    ", we focus on forces that the vortices experience as a result of geometric constraints , with an emphasis on those encountered in thin layers of liquid helium wetting a _ curved _ substrate with spatially varying gaussian curvature . as a result of the broken translational invariance of the underlying curved space ,",
    "the energy of a single vortex with circulation quantum number @xmath0 at position @xmath1 includes both a divergent term and a position dependent self - energy , @xmath2 , given by @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the superfluid stiffness expressed in terms of the @xmath5he atomic mass , @xmath6 , and the superfluid mass density , @xmath7 .",
    "the potential @xmath8 is obtained from solving a covariant poisson equation with the gaussian curvature , @xmath9 , acting as a source @xmath10 vortices ( and anti - vortices ) are attracted ( repelled ) to regions of negative ( positive ) gaussian curvature .",
    "these geometric interactions , while more exotic , are similar in origin to boundary - vortex interactions and can be suitably treated by the method of conformal mapping .",
    "similar ideas naturally arise in a variety of soft - matter systems which have been confined in a thin layer wetting a curved substrate .",
    "the specific form of the resulting geometric interactions depends on the symmetry of the order parameter as well as on the shape of the substrate .",
    "examples that have been studied both theoretically and experimentally include colloidal crystals on curved interfaces @xcite , columnar phases of block co - polymers @xcite as well as thin layers of nematic liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "fueled by the drive towards technological applications based on the notion of self - assembly directed by geometry @xcite , the study of these @xmath11 materials aims at predicting how the non - uniform distribution of curvature of the underlying substrates induces an inhomogeneous phase in the curved monolayer .",
    "an understanding of the resulting macroscopic properties can be built from a mesoscopic description cast in terms of the energetics of the topological defects which often exist even in the ground state and play a crucial role in determining how the material melts or ruptures .",
    "the advantage of this approach stems from the huge reduction in degrees of freedom achieved upon re - expressing the energy stored in the elastic field in terms of a few topological defects , rather than keeping track of the state of all the microscopic components , e.g. individual particle positions or molecular orientations .",
    "this step allows one to carry out efficient computational studies @xcite and provides a suitable starting point for analytical work in the form of effective free energies derived from continuum elastic theory .",
    "many of the mathematical techniques employed in this article to study vortices in curved superfluid films find application in the soft matter domain , in particular in those contexts where bond - orientational order is important @xcite . in flat space both superfluid and liquid crystal films can be described , as a first approximation , by an xy model@xcite .",
    "both liquid crystal disclinations and vortices are modeled as a coulomb gas of charged particles interacting logarithmically",
    ". however , the quantum nature of the problem considered in the present work introduces a fundamental difference between these two classes of systems that is best illustrated by contrasting the angle of the liquid crystal director with the phase of the superfluid s collective wave function .",
    "the former represents the orientation of a vector ( with both ends identified in the case of a nematic ) that lives in the tangent space of the surface while the latter is a quantum mechanical object that transforms like a scalar since it is defined in an internal space .",
    "this subtle difference resurfaces upon considering the distinct curved - space generalizations of the xy model that apply to each of these two systems .",

    "the substrate becomes more curved , the resulting energy cost of geometric frustration can be lowered by generating disclination - dipoles in the ground state even in the absence of topological constraints .",
    "the connection @xmath17 is a geometric gauge field akin to the electromagnetic vector potential , with the gaussian curvature playing the role of a magnetic field .",
    "if topological defects are present , they appear as monopoles in the singular part of @xmath24 . in analogy with electromagnetic theory ,",
    "their interaction with the gaussian curvature arises mathematically from the cross - products between @xmath24 and the geometry induced vector potential @xmath17 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : patic - ener ] ) . as a result of this interaction , disclinations in a liquid crystal",
    "are attracted to regions of the substrate whose curvature has the same sign as the defect s topological charge @xcite , whereas vortices in a superfluid favor negatively curved regions independently of their sense of circulation .",
    "the anomalous coupling between vortices and gaussian curvature introduced in equations ( [ eq : ecurv - s2bis ] ) and ( [ eq : geompdeq ] ) originates from the distortion of the flow pattern by the protrusions and wrinkles of the surface .    for a disclination with topological index @xmath0 ( defined by the amount @xmath25 increases along a path enclosing the defect s core ) the geometric potential @xmath26 reads @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the elastic stiffness and",
    "@xmath29 is the same potential defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : geompdeq ] ) .",
    "note that the anomalous coupling also contributes to determine the energetics of liquid crystal disclinations but , in this case , the gauge coupling , which is linear in @xmath30 , is stronger for small @xmath30 .    to understand the physical and mathematical origin of these distinct coupling mechanisms , note that in the ground state of a @xmath5he film , the phase @xmath19 can be constant throughout the surface so that the corresponding energy vanishes . in a system with geometric frustration ,",
    "the gauge coupling between defects and the underlying curvature is mediated by the deformed ground state texture that exists in the liquid crystal layer prior to the introduction of the defects simply as a result of geometrical constraints .",
    "once a defect is introduced it interacts with these preexisting elastic deformations . unlike the case of orientational order",
    "considered previously , no geometric frustration exists in the superfluid film .",
    "the superfluid free energy @xmath31 to be minimized is a simple scalar generalization of the familiar flat space counterpart @xmath32 the crucial point is that no connection @xmath17 is necessary to write down the covariant derivative for this simpler case of a scalar order parameter .",
    "therefore the ground state is given by @xmath33 equal to a constant .",
    "there is no preexisting texture for a vortex to interact with , and so another mechanism is required to explain the coupling of vortices to geometry . in the following sections",
    ", we will employ the method of conformal mapping to demonstrate that when an isolated vortex is placed on a curved surface it feels a force as if there were a smeared out topological ",
    "image charge , \" jointly proportional to the vortex s own circulation and the gaussian curvature across the substrate .",
    "such an imaginary topological charge distribution produces a _ real _ force analogous to the force on an electrostatic charge due to its mirror image in a conducting surface .",
    "the method of conformal mapping may seem , prima facie , a surprising route to derive a coupling between vortices and geometry , because the free energy of eq .",
    "( [ eq : supfl - i ] ) is invariant under conformal transformations that introduce a non - uniform compression of the surface while keeping local angles unchanged .",
    "this invariance property at first seems to rule out the possibility of a geometrical interaction !",
    "this apparent contradiction can be seen by choosing a special set of ( isothermal ) coordinates that can always bring the two dimensional metric tensor in the diagonal form @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the result of this step is to eliminate the geometry dependence from the free energy of eq .",
    "( [ eq : supfl - i ] ) since the product @xmath35 and @xmath31 reduces to its counterpart for a planar surface , where there is of course no geometry dependence .",
    "an interaction between vortices and geometry violates this conformal symmetry of the free energy from which it emerges , but in fact the conformal symmetry is not an exact symmetry when vortices are present .",
    "analogous subtleties frequently arise in the study of fields that fluctuate thermally or quantum mechanically , due to the occurrence of a cut - off length scale below which fluctuations can not occur . a conformal",
    "mapping is a strange type of symmetry that stretches lengths and thus does not preserve the microscopic structure of a system . at finite temperatures ,",
    "the discreteness of a system , such as a thermally fluctuating membrane @xcite which is actually made up of a network of molecules , can have an important effect because the fluctuations excite modes with microscopic wavelengths .",
    "this produces violations of the conformal symmetry at every point of the surface . in a superfluid at zero temperature ,",
    "however , short wavelengths not describable by the continuum free energy @xmath31 are excited only in the cores of vortices .",
    "obtaining a finite value for the energy necessitates the removal of vortex cores of a certain fixed radius in the local tangent plane , so a conformal mapping is not a symmetry in the neighborhood of a vortex . however",
    "the amount by which this symmetry fails can be calculated in a simple form ( intriguingly independent of the microscopic model of the cores ) in terms of the rescaling function @xmath36 evaluated at the locations of the vortices , where the symmetry fails . rather than ruling out the possiblity of a geometric interaction , a realistic treatment of conformal",
    "mapping becomes a powerful mathematical tool for deriving these interactions , a technique which is relevant especially to other branches of theoretical physics such as the study of scattering amplitudes in string theory @xcite .    while the free energy , @xmath31 , of the curved superfluid layer in eq . ( [ eq : supfl - i ] ) does not exhibit a _",
    "geometric _ gauge field , rotating the sample at a constant angular velocity leads to an energy of the same form as eq .",
    "( [ eq : patic - ener ] ) .",
    "the resulting forces exerted on the vortices compete with the geometric interactions to determine the equilibrium configurations of an arrangement of topological defects .",
    "this simple idea is behind some of the experimental suggestions put forward in this article to map out the geometric potential by progressively increasing the rotational speed while monitoring the equilibrium position of say a single vortex on a helium coated surface shaped like the bottom of a wine bottle @xcite .",
    "since the position dependence of the force induced by the rotation is easily calculated , one can read off the geometric interaction by simply assuming force balance .",
    "the theory of curved helium films also helps build intuition for the more general case of vortex lines confined in a bounded three dimensional region such as the cavity shown in cross - section in fig .",
    "[ fig : slickslopes]a .",
    "the vortex , drawn as a bold black line , can be pinned by the constriction of the container .",
    "the classic problem of understanding the interaction of the vortex with itself and with the bump as the superfluid flows past @xcite , is of crucial importance in elucidating how vortices can be produced when a superfluid starts rotating despite the absence of any friction .",

    "this simplifying assumption omits any long range forces experienced by the vortices as they interact with the boundaries ( or among themselves ) . in the opposite limit of films with uniform thickness ( which can be thought of as special types of bulk superfluid regions with two parallel boundaries , as in fig .",

    "this is the regime of interest to our investigation .",
    "this article is organized in two tracks .",
    "the first , comprising sections [ subsec : effective]@xmath38[sec : experimental ] , is phenomenological in nature and emphasizes intuitive analogies between the ( non - linear ) geometric forces and conventional electrostatics , simple illustrations of the main results and experimental ideas .",
    "the second track , sections [ sec : complex]@xmath38[sec : geomineq ] is more technical and presents a unified derivation of the geometric potential by the method of conformal mapping and its application to the study of complex surface morphologies .",
    "the first track starts with a review of superfluid dynamics that can be used to relate the anomalous coupling to hydrodynamic lift . in sec .",
    "[ subsec : anomalous ] , the geometrical force is evaluated , using a mapping between the geometric potential studied here and the familiar newton s theorem that allows an efficient calculation of the gravitational field for a spherically symmetric mass distribution .",
    "an intriguing consequence of this analogy is that vortices on saddle surfaces can be trapped in regions of negative curvature leading to geometrically confined persistent currents as discussed in section [ bs ] .",
    "section [ earnshaw ] relates this observation to earnshaw s theorem from electrostatics . upon heating and subsequently cooling a curved superfluid film ,",
    "some of the thermally generated defects can remain trapped in metastable states located at the saddles of the substrate .",
    "the existence of such geometry induced vortex hysteresis is conjectured in section [ subsec : cande ] . in section [ subsec : rotation ] , we derive the forces experienced by vortices when the vessel containing the superfluid layer is rotated around the axis of symmetry of a curved surface shaped as a gaussian bump .",
    "the dependence of single and multiple defect - configurations on different angular speeds and aspect ratios of the bump is studied in sections [ subsec : single ] and [ subsec : multiple ] .",
    "the abrikosov lattice of vortices on a curved surface is discussed in section [ subsec : abr ] . in realistic experimental situations",
    "the thickness of the superfluid layer will not be uniform and additional forces will drive vortices towards thinner regions of the sample .",
    "the strength of these forces is assessed in section [ sec : experimental ] and related to spatial variations of the film thickness due to gravity and surface tension .",
    "a short discussion of choice of parameters for the proposed rotation experiments follows in section [ subsec : nucleation ] .",
    "the relevance of our discussion to experiments performed in bounded three dimensional samples is addressed in section [ sec : unevenexptl ] .",

    "the computational efficiency of this approach is illustrated in section [ sec : bubble ] where the geometric potential of a vortex is evaluated on an enneper disk , a strongly deformed minimal surface .",
    "we show that changing the geometry of the substrate has interesting effects not only on the one - body geometric potential but also on the two - body interaction between vortices . in section [ sec : bumps ] we use conformal methods to show how a periodic lattice of bumps can cause the vortex interaction to become anisotropic . in section [ sec : zucchini ] , we demonstrate that the quantization of circulation leads to an extremely long - range force on an elongated surface with the topology of a sphere .",

    "the whole notion of splitting the energy in a one body geometric potential and a vortex - vortex interaction is subject to ambiguities on deformed spheres .",
    "section [ sec : noodles ] provides some guidance on how to perform calculations in this context by choosing a convenient green s function among the several available .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : geomineq ] , we present a discussion of some general upper bounds which constrain the strength of geometric forces .",
    "the conclusion serves as a concise summary and contains a table designed to locate at a glance our main results throughout the article including the more technical points relegated to appendices but useful to perform calculations .",
    "we start by writing down the collective wave function of the superfluid as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a set of curvilinear coordinates for the surface , @xmath6 is the mass of a @xmath41he atom and @xmath42 is the superfluid mass density that we shall assume to be constant in what follows . to obtain the superfluid current we can use the standard expression @xmath43 showing that the superfluid velocity is given by @xmath44 the circulation along a path @xmath45 enclosing a vortex",
    "is given by @xmath46 where the quantum of circulation , @xmath47 , is equal to 9.98 10@xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 and the integer @xmath30 is the topological index of the vortex .",
    "the free energy can be cast in the form @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the ( inverse ) metric tensor describing the surface on which the superfluid layer lies and @xmath16 is its determinant .",
    "we will often use the superfluid stiffness @xmath53    this expression for the free - energy can be parameterized in terms of the vortex positions once the seemingly divergent kinetic energy near a vortex core is correctly accounted for .",
    "as is well known , the radius - independence of the circulation about a vortex implies that the velocity in its proximity is given by @xmath54 , which leads to a logarithmic divergence in ( [ eq : free - energy ] ) .",
    "the energy stored in an annulus of internal radius @xmath55 and outer radius @xmath56 reads @xmath57 which diverges as @xmath58 .",
    "a physical trait of superfluid helium prevents this from happening : it can not sustain speeds which are greater than @xmath59 , the critical velocity .",
    "thus the superfluidity is destroyed below a core radius of @xmath60 .",
    "this breakdown may be modeled by excising a disk of radius @xmath61 around each vortex and by adding a constant core energy @xmath62 to account for the energy associated with the disruption of the superfluidity in the core .",
    "starting on the flat plane , the interaction of two vortices can now be determined .",
    "superimposing the fields of the two vortices and integrating the cross - term in the kinetic energy of eq .",
    "( [ eq : free - energy ] ) leads to a coulomb - like interaction , @xmath63 in addition to vortex self - energies . in deducing the force between the vortices from this expression",
    ", it is useful to assume that @xmath61 does not vary significantly with position .",
    "the justification for this simplification is that the background flow due to other vortices only gives a fractionally small correction to the @xmath64 flow near each vortex , and therefore barely affects where the critical velocity is attained .    for the more complicated case of a _ curved _ surface , with a very distant boundary ( see @xcite for the discussion of effects due to a boundary at a finite distance ) , we found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the energy including both single - particle and two - particle interactions is , @xmath65 apart from a position - independent term ( given for a distant circular boundary of radius @xmath66 by @xmath67 , with @xmath68 the total number of vortices and @xmath62 the core energy of one of them ) .",

    "equation ( [ eq : basicgreen ] ) determines the green s function up to a constant provided that we assume additionally that the green s function is symmetric between its two arguments .",
    "the constant is fixed by assuming that at large separations , the green s function approaches the green s function of an undeformed plane .",
    "this expression shows that vortices behave like electrostatic particles , with charges given by @xmath75 and coupling constant @xmath28 .",
    "the single - particle potential @xmath76 is the  geometric potential \" defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : geompdeq ] ) .",
    "this potential entails a repulsion @xmath77 of vortices of either sign from positive curvature and an attraction to negative curvature .",
    "the following analogy with boundary interactions and image charges is useful .",
    "the flow - field is modified by having to conform to the curvature , leading to an image charge of the vortex which is spread continuously over the surface , with density @xmath78 .",
    "just like the image of a vortex in a circular boundary has an equal and opposite circulation , the continuous image of the vortex in the curvature has a charge density proportional to the number of quanta @xmath30 in the vortex .",
    "this point of view may be connected to fluid mechanics by analyzing the streamlines on the bump and in the presence of a circular boundary as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : volcano ] .",
    "streamlines are tangent to the direction of flow _ and _ their density is proportional to the local speed . only an incompressible velocity field ( @xmath79 )",
    "may be described by streamlines , since incompressibility ensures that any closed curve has an equal number of streamlines entering and exiting .",
    "this condition is satisfied for superfluids ( far below the critical speed ) since minimizing ( [ eq : free - energy ] ) leads to @xmath80 , or @xmath79 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : velocity ] ) .",
    "thus the flow is both irrotational ( the circulation around any curve , not enclosing a vortex , is @xmath81 ) and incompressible : @xmath82 the former relation implies that we may write @xmath83 so that the streamlines are equally spaced level curves of @xmath84 .",
    "( for example , around a vortex , the radii of the successive streamlines forms a geometric sequence , @xmath85 where @xmath86 sets the ratio between flowline density and speed . )",
    "now consider , as an illustration , the flow field on the slope of the bump represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : volcano ] . the curves must spread out to go over the bump , leading to a lower velocity above the vortex . by bernoulli s principle ( true for irrotational flows )",
    ", this creates a high pressure that pushes the vortex away from the bump .",
    "note , however , that the actual motion of a vortex is more subtle : although the gradient of the energy points away from the bump , a vortex ( disregarding friction ) always moves at right angles to the gradient of the energy .",
    "thus a vortex in the absence of drag forces actually circles around the bump , in the same direction as the fluid flows around the vortex .",
    "dissipation converts the motion into an outward spiral@xcite .",
    "we will not study the dynamics .",
    "a convenient mathematical formulation of the problem of determining the flow pattern of a collection of vortices is obtained by introducing the scalar function @xmath87 which satisfies @xmath88 the sum can be described as a singular distribution of surface charge .",
