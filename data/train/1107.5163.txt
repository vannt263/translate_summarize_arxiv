    "chiral effective field theory ( eft ) provides a powerful framework to systematically describe low - energy dynamics of few- and many - nucleon systems .",

    ", the most advanced few - nucleon studies have been carried out within a framework based on pions and nucleons as the only explicit degrees of freedom taken into account in the effective lagrangian . within this approach , the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) force is currently available up to next - to - next - to - next - to leading order ( n@xmath2lo  ) in the chiral expansion . at this chiral order",
    ", it receives contributions from one- , two- and three - pion exchange diagrams as well as short - range nn contact interactions with up to four derivatives . as demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite , nn phase shifts are accurately described at n@xmath2lo  up to laboratory energies of the order of 200 mev .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty due to truncation of the chiral expansion is estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite by means of a cutoff variation . within the spectral function regularization ( sfr )",
    "framework @xcite adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the nn potential depends on two ultraviolet cutoffs @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the first one removes large - mass components in the spectrum of the two - pion exchange potential which can not be correctly described within the chiral eft framework while the other one provides regularization of the lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "five different combinations of these cut - off parameters are available for the nn potentials of ref .",
    "the residual dependence of low - energy observables on the cutoff choice provides a measure of the importance of higher - order contact interactions and thus may serve as an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty .",
    "parallel to these developments three - nucleon force ( 3nf ) has also been explored within the framework of chiral effective field theory .",
    "the first nonvanishing contributions to the 3nf emerge at next - to - next - to - leading order ( n@xmath5lo  )  @xcite from the two - pion exchange and one - pion - exchange - contact diagrams as well as the purely short - range derivative - less three - nucleon contact interaction  @xcite , see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a pioneering work along this line .",
    "the resulting n@xmath5lo  three - nucleon potential depends on two low - energy constants ( lecs ) @xmath6 and @xmath7 accompanying the short - range @xmath8 and @xmath9 vertices , respectively .",
    "the values of these lecs need to be fixed from a fit to few - nucleon data . among a few possible observables that have been used in this connection",
    "are the triton binding energy and the nucleon - deuteron doublet scattering length @xmath10 @xcite , @xmath11-particle binding energy @xcite , the properties of light nuclei @xcite and the triton beta decay @xcite .",
    "the n@xmath5lo  3nf of  @xcite was successfully used in three - body calculations , see refs .",
    "@xcite for a few examples of recent studies . at this order ,",
    "chiral eft yields a good description of elastic scattering and deuteron breakup observables up to energies of about @xmath12 mev .",
    "the accuracy of the results in this regime is comparable with the one that is achieved by realistic phenomenological nn and 3n interactions such as e.g.  av18  @xcite 2nf in combination with urbanaix  @xcite 3nf or cd - bonn  @xcite 2nf in combination with the tucson - melbourne  @xcite 3nf , see @xcite .",
    "however , the spread of the results is relatively large for some spin observables which clearly calls for the inclusion of new terms of the nuclear interaction that occur at higher orders of the chiral expansion .",
    "subleading contributions to the 3nf are currently being investigated by several groups . at n@xmath2lo  , one has to take into account ( irreducible ) contributions emerging from all possible one - loop three - nucleon diagrams constructed with the lowest order vertices .",
    "in addition , there are ( tree - level ) leading relativistic corrections , see @xcite for an early work on the longest - range relativistic corrections .",
    "note that the tree diagrams involving higher - order vertices from the effective chiral lagrangian do not produce any irreducible pieces .",
    "effects due to two - pion exchange 3nf in elastic nucleon - deuteron scattering were already explored by ishikawa and robilotta @xcite within a hybrid approach and found to be rather small .",
    "the n@xmath2lo  contributions feed into five different topologies as will be explained in detail in the next section .",
    "the explicit expressions both in momentum and in coordinate space for the long - range contributions have already been worked out @xcite .",
    "their inclusion in numerical few - body calculations appears to be challenging due to the very rich and complicated operator structure .",
    "the large number of terms in the 3nf at n@xmath2lo  , see ref .",
    "@xcite , requires an efficient method of performing the partial wave decomposition .",
    "recently such a method has been proposed @xcite and tested for the tucson - melbourne force  @xcite .",
    "here and in what follows , this approach will be referred to as the automatized partial wave decomposition ( apwd ) . in this paper",
    "we apply this method of the numerical partial wave decomposition to the n@xmath2lo  3nf contributions derived in  @xcite . for the first time",
    ", the parts of 3nf at n@xmath2lo  different from the two - pion exchange force are included in the triton and the scattering length calculations . in order to test the implementations and get a first hint to possible effects of these forces",
    ", we fix the two lecs entering the 3nf from the triton binding energy and the nucleon - deuteron doublet scattering length and explore the effects due to these novel 3nf terms by computing the @xmath2h properties .",
    "although this calculations is still incomplete since not all 3nf contributions at n@xmath2lo  are taken into account , it provides an important first step towards the complete n@xmath2lo  analysis of 3n scattering and demonstrates our ability to numerically handle the rather complicated structure of the subleading chiral 3nf .",

    "[ section1 ] we describe briefly the structure of the chiral 3nf at n@xmath2lo  . in sect .",

    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "the subleading ( i.e.  n@xmath2lo  ) contributions to the three - nucleon force @xmath14 can be written in the form  @xcite @xmath15 where the individual terms refer , in order , to the two - pion exchange , two - pion - one - pion - exchange , ring ( i.e.  one pion being exchanged between each of the three nucleon pairs ) , one - pion - exchange - contact and two - pion - exchange - contact contributions as well as the leading relativistic corrections , see fig .  1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite for a diagrammatic representation .",
    "the expressions for the ( static ) long - range part of the 3nf given by the first three terms in the above equation have been worked out in heavy - baryon chiral perturbation theory in ref.@xcite .",
    "the two - pion exchange contribution at the one - loop level has also been calculated within the infrared - regularized version of chiral perturbation theory in ref .",
    "the shorter - range contributions involving two - nucleon contact interactions and relativistic corrections are currently being worked out @xcite .    while the two - pion - exchange @xmath16 and one - pion - exchange - contact parts @xmath17 already occur at n@xmath5lo  and receive corrections at n@xmath2lo  , the remaining topologies first emerge at n@xmath2lo  .",
    "it is important to emphasize that all subleading contributions to the 3nf are parameter - free .",
    "thus , the low - energy constants @xmath6 and @xmath7 entering the one - pion - exchange - contact and the purely short - range parts of the 3nf at n@xmath5lo  are the only unknown parameters up to n@xmath2lo  .    here and in what follows , we adopt the notation in which a given 3nf @xmath14 is decomposed into three terms @xmath18 where each @xmath19 is symmetrical under interchanging the nucleons @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) .",
    "clearly , this condition does not specify @xmath24 uniquely . in the following we choose @xmath24 in such a way that the number of operator structures is minimized which is convenient for the apwd .",
    "the operator structure of the 2@xmath25 exchange part @xmath26 at n@xmath2lo  remains the same as at n@xmath5lo  @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the momentum transfer to the i - th nucleon , @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) are pauli spin ( isospin ) matrices for nucleon @xmath32 .",
    "the scalar functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 depend on the lecs @xmath35 which accompany the subleading pion - nucleon vertices .",
    "chiral expansion of @xmath36 and @xmath37 up to n@xmath2lo   has the form  @xcite @xmath38 with @xmath39 where the loop function @xmath40 is defined as @xmath41 the axial - vector coupling constant , the weak pion decay constant and the pion mass are denoted as @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",

    "the interchange of nucleons @xmath52 refers to the interchange of momentum vectors , spin and isospin matrices and arguments of the functions @xmath53 .",

    "@xcite .",
    "the modifications of the one - pion - exchange - contact @xmath58 term arising at n@xmath2lo  are in preparation  @xcite .",
    "thus , instead of the full @xmath58 interaction we use the lowest - order result for it resulting at n@xmath5lo  @xcite : @xmath59 the low energy constant @xmath6 can be expressed as @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is a dimensionless free parameter and the chiral symmetry breaking scale @xmath62 is estimated to be @xmath63 mev . here and in what follows , we use @xmath64 mev for the pion decay constant .",
    "the value of @xmath61 has to be determined from experimental data .",
    "this is described in section [ section4 ] for our fit for the test case of this study .",
    "of course , results of this fit will significantly change when the complete short range interaction is taken into account .",
    "as already pointed out above , the remaining terms @xmath65 and @xmath66 are also not available yet @xcite and thus can not be taken into account in the present study . finally , the purely short - range part of the 3nf has the form @xcite : @xmath67 again , the lec @xmath7 is usually expressed in terms of a dimension - less parameter @xmath68 via @xmath69 which needs to be determined from ( at least ) three - nucleon data .    to summarize , in this paper we use the @xmath26 , @xmath49 , @xmath54 n@xmath2lo   terms combined with the @xmath70 and @xmath71 terms at n@xmath5lo .",

    "( [ e3nf_split ] ) can be obtained from @xmath24 by appropriate permutations of nucleons .",
    "we work in the momentum space using three - nucleon partial - wave states @xmath74 in the @xmath75-coupling   @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are magnitudes of the standard jacobi momenta and @xmath11 denotes a set of discrete quantum numbers defined in the following way : the spin @xmath79 of the subsystem composed from nucleons 2 and 3 is coupled with their orbital angular momentum @xmath80 to the total angular momentum @xmath20 .",
    "the spin @xmath81 of the spectator particle @xmath1 couples with its relative orbital angular momentum @xmath82 to the total angular momentum @xmath83 of nucleon @xmath1 .",
    "finally , @xmath20 and @xmath83 are coupled to the total 3n angular momentum @xmath84 with the projection @xmath85 .",
    "for the isospin part , the total isospin @xmath86 of the subsystem @xmath87 is coupled with the isospin @xmath81 of the spectator nucleon to the total 3n isospin @xmath88 with the projection @xmath89 .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath90 and @xmath54 forces in the basis @xmath74 are obtained using the recently proposed apwd method @xcite . in this approach the spin - momentum and isospin parts of three - nucleon interactions are calculated using a software for symbolic calculations .",
    "the resulting momentum - dependent functions are then integrated numerically in five dimensions over angular variables . the major advantage of this method is its generality . it can be applied to _ any _ momentum - spin - isospin operator including , in particular , the full operator structure of the 3nf at n@xmath2lo  including even the non - local relativisitic corrections .",
    "the only complication emerges in the treatment of the ring contributions to the 3nf due to rather complex expressions for the functions @xmath56 and @xmath57 which involve certain scalar integrals related to the three - point function . for any given values of the arguments , these integrals have to be computed numerically .",
    "this evaluation is too expensive to be carried out on - the - fly during the apwd .",
    "moreover , while the functions @xmath91 and @xmath92 are , of course , finite and smooth for all possible values of their arguments , they are given in ref .",
    "@xcite as linear combinations of terms , some of which are becoming singular under certain kinematical conditions .",
    "their numerical implementation therefore requires special care . in order to deal with these difficulties",
    ", we first evaluate the functions @xmath91 and @xmath92 at a ( fixed ) dense grid of points for their arguments and then use interpolation to compute them for arbitrary values of @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 as needed in the apwd approach .",
    "we have carefully checked the stability of this procedure by increasing the density of the grid points .",
    "finally , the partial wave decomposition of @xmath70 and @xmath71 is performed with the standard techniques  @xcite but also verified with the new method .",
    "examples of the resulting matrix elements @xmath96 are given in fig .",
    "[ fig1.1 ] as a function of the momentum @xmath77 . here",
    ", we fix the momenta to be @xmath97 @xmath98 , @xmath99 @xmath98 and @xmath100 @xmath98 and consider the following four channel combinations : ( @xmath101 ) , ( @xmath102 ) , ( @xmath103 ) and ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "these channels correspond to the quantum numbers given in tab .",

    ".the values of the discrete quantum numbers for the selected @xmath11 states ( [ eqn.alpha ] ) with the total angular momentum @xmath105 , the total isospin @xmath106 and its projection @xmath107 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     last but not least , we emphasize that the expectation values discussed above as well as the separation of the potential energy into the contributions due to the nn potential and 3nf do _ not _ correspond to observable quantities and are expected to show a strong cutoff dependence .",
    "notice further that expectation values of the various 3nf contributions are , strictly speaking , bare quantities .",
    "comparing their size with the one of the n@xmath5lo terms does , therefore , not allow to draw conclusions about the convergence of the chiral expansion  @xcite .",
    "it is comforting to see that all expectation values turn out to be of a reasonable size .",
    "we now turn to the two - nucleon correlation function of @xmath2h which is defined as  @xcite @xmath108 here , @xmath109 is the relative distance corresponding to the jacobi momentum @xmath110 . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the correlation function is shown for the same combinations of the regularization parameters as in tab.[tab1 ] .",
    "thin lines represent predictions based on nn interactions only while thick ones show the predictions based on nn+3n forces .",
    "as expected , the softest cutoff value @xmath111 mev yields a more flat correlation function with the less amount of the short - range correlations .",
    "the higher @xmath4 values prefer distributions concentrated around the maximum at @xmath112 fm .",
    "the effects of the 3nfs are small for the lowest @xmath4 but increase with increasing @xmath4 . for the lowest @xmath4 there is also a strong dependence of the correlation function on the sfr parameter @xmath113 .",
    "in this paper we , for the first time , included the long - range n@xmath2lo  corrections to the 3nf in the faddeev calculations .",
    "these novel two - pion - exchange , two - pion - one - pion and ring interactions supplemented with the one - pion - exchange and contact terms emerging at n@xmath5lo  represent , presently , the most advanced chiral 3nf .",
    "we use this force in the triton and the doublet neutron - deuteron scattering length faddeev calculations to fix the two low - energy parameters @xmath61 and @xmath68 for different sets of regularization parameters , which cut off large - momentum or , equivalently , short - range components in the few - nucleon states .",
    "while the value of the lec @xmath61 remains fairly stable , @xmath68 features a stronger sensitivity to regularization parameters",
    ". it will be interesting whether such a behavior is also seen for fits involving the complete n@xmath2lo  3nf .",
    "we also studied the individual contributions of the various topologies to the triton binding energy .",
    "the expectation values of the two - pion - one - pion and ring terms turn out to be smaller than the ones of the dominant two - pion - exchange 3nf for softer values of the regulator .",
    "generally , all expectation values are found to be sizable .",
    "as expected , we observe a strong sensitivity of the expectation values to the regularization parameters .",
    "we also looked at the impact of the used 3nf on the two - nucleon correlation function in the triton .",
    "while our work does not yet correspond to a complete n@xmath2lo analysis due to the shorter - range contributions and relativistic corrections to the 3nf which are not yet available and are still missing in our calculations , it does represent a very important step in this direction and provides a proof - of - principle that the very complex operator structure of the 3nf at n@xmath2lo  can be successfully implemented in few - body calculations . in the future",
    ", this study should be extended to explore effects of the novel terms in the 3nf in few - nucleon scattering .",
    "this work is in progress . to complete the analysis of the 3nf at n@xmath2lo  the inclusion of full structure of shorter - range @xmath58 , @xmath65 as well as @xmath66 terms should be pursued .",
    "the numerical implementation of the new terms can be straightforwardly performed using the newly developed apwd scheme , which is successfully tested for the long - range terms in the present study .",
    "finally , it should be emphasized that the present work also opens the way for applying the novel chiral nuclear forces in many - body calculations , see e.g.  @xcite for some exciting recent developments along these lines based on n@xmath5lo  3nfs .",
