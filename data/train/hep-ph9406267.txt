    "there has recently been renewed interest in the charge form factors of pseudoscalar mesons because cebaf is planning experiments to measure independently the pion ( e-93 - 021 ) and kaon ( e-93 - 018 ) charge form factors in the range of @xmath0 gev@xmath1 . on the other hand , theoretical predictions of the kaon form factor given in refs .",
    "@xcite differ significantly .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to analyze the kaon form factor , and in general the pseudoscalar form factors , in a different model .    since an _ ab - initio _ qcd calculation for hadronic wave functions is currently not feasible , it is important to have qcd - inspired models which realistically describe hadron static properties .",
    "such a model has been described in refs .",
    "@xcite and many observables have been calculated within this model  @xcite and found in good agreement with experiment .    in this paper",
    "we extend the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite to pseudoscalar mesons in which the constituent quarks have unequal masses .",
    "the main uncertainty in this model is due to the uncertainty in the undetermined momentum wave function .",
    "we find that the charge form factors are approximately insensitive for a large class of wave functions .",
    "this is a generalization of the finding in ref .",
    "@xcite which studies the connection between the radius and the decay constant of the pion .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the charge form factors for the pion and kaon are given in the parameterization @xmath2 .",
    "unfortunately , this specific representation is only valid for @xmath3 gev@xmath1 for the pion and @xmath4 gev@xmath1 for the kaon .",
    "this paper presents the full calculation .    in the next section",
    "we describe the model and give the formula for the charge form factor . in sec .",
    "iii the numerical results are presented and compared with available experimental data and other theoretical calculations .",

    "the light - cone constituent quark model given in ref .",
    "@xcite provides a framework for representing the general structure of the two - quark wave functions for mesons .",
    "the wave function is constructed as the product of a momentum wave function , which is spherically symmetric and invariant under permutations , and a spin - isospin wave function , which is uniquely determined by symmetry requirements .",
    "a wigner ( melosh  @xcite ) rotation is applied to the spinors , so that the wave function of the meson is an eigenfunction of @xmath5 and @xmath6  @xcite . to represent the range of uncertainty in the possible form of the momentum wave function we choose two simple functions of @xmath7 ; a gaussian or harmonic oscillator ( ho ) wave function and a power - law wave function : @xmath8 where @xmath9 sets",
    "the scale of the nucleon size , and @xmath10 is the three - vector on the light - cone defined below .",
    "this may seem quite arbitrary , but as we will show below , the form factors are essentially independent of the shape of the wave function for @xmath11 .    since the four - momentum @xmath12 is spacelike it is always possible to orient the axes in such a manner that @xmath13 .",
    "the charge form factor @xmath14 of the pseudoscalar meson is then given by the matrix element ( @xmath15 ) @xmath16 the general formula for the pseudoscalar meson is then @xmath17 with  @xcite @xmath18 the relative three - momentum @xmath19 in this formula is defined as @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the four - momentum of the meson and the first constituent quark , respectively . the energy @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 , the invariant mass @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "the wave function is normalized as @xmath28 so that @xmath29 gives the charge of the particle , because @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the radius of the particle is defined by @xmath32 .",
    "the expression for the decay constant is given in eq .",
    "( 3.3 ) of ref .  @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the model have to be determined by comparison with experimental data .",
    "they are the constituent masses @xmath33 of the quarks and the confinement scale @xmath34 of the bound meson .",
    "the parameters used in this paper are given in table  [ tab : para ] .",
    "for the @xmath35quark sector the parameters from ref .",
    "@xcite are chosen .",
    "these four parameters have been obtained by fitting the decay constants @xmath36 and the decay rate for @xmath37 . with these parameters",
    "all the processes described in ref .",
    "@xcite can be described in addition to the charge form factors discussed in this paper .",
    "the @xmath38quark mass is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite where the decays @xmath39 and @xmath40 are analyzed .",
    "there is an uncertainty in @xmath9 , which we determined by fitting the decay constant @xmath41 as given by recent lattice calculations  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath42quark mass is taken from recent nonrelativistic lattice calculations  @xcite .",
    "again we fit @xmath9 to obtain the decay constant @xmath43 obtained in ref .",
    "table  [ tab : para ] also shows the @xmath9s for the power - law wave function in eq .",
    "[ eq : power ] with @xmath44 , which are determined to yield the same decay constants as for the harmonic oscillator wave function .",
    "the weak decay constants for the @xmath45 and @xmath46 mesons for different values of the parameter @xmath9 are given in table  [ tab : wdc ] .",
    "there is a strong dependence on @xmath9 so that our model does not restrict the decay constants of the @xmath45 and @xmath46 mesons very well .",
    "the weak decay constants and the charge radii are given in table  [ tab : static ] and compared with data .",
    "all the radii agree with experiment were available .",
    "we also achieve the result @xmath47 given in ref .",
    "this differs from heavy quark effective theory which predicts @xmath48 .",
    "it has already been noted in ref .",
    "@xcite that the wigner rotation of the spin lowers this ratio .",
    "figures [ fig:1 ]  [ fig:6 ] show the charge form factors of the pion , kaon , d- and b - mesons , respectively , together with experimental data where available .",
    "the results for the pion are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] with data for low @xmath49  @xcite and in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] with data for high @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "the solid line represents the ho wave function in eq .",
    "[ eq : ho ] which fits the data best for both low and high momentum transfer .",

    "[ eq : power ] with @xmath50 ( dotted line ) , @xmath44 ( dashed line ) , and @xmath51 ( dot - dashed line ) . the power - law wave function for @xmath11 can describe the data as well .",
    "the result is approximately independent of the wave function for the experimental accessible @xmath49-region  @xcite .",
    "this wave function independence is even better fulfilled for the heavy quark sector as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] and [ fig:6 ] .",
    "this is astonishing since for baryons it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the high momentum tail of the wave function is important for @xmath52 gev@xmath1 . on the other hand , ref .",
    "@xcite describes that static properties are exactly independent of the wave function even for the light quark sector .",
    "the result of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] is expected from ref .",
    "@xcite which confirms the approximate relation @xmath53 for different wave functions .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] shows that the high momentum tail of the wave function does not matter for energies accessible to present experiments .",
    "important is the parameter @xmath9 which determines the overall shape of the wave function .",
    "this has independently been found by jean  @xcite .",
    "indeed all the different curves in fig .  4 of ref .",
    "@xcite can be obtained with a ho wave function with fixed quark mass and different @xmath9s .",
    "the results for the kaon are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] with data for low @xmath49  @xcite and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] for high @xmath49 .",
    "again , the solid and the dashed lines give the result for the ho and power - law wave function for @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "this should represent the range of uncertainty in the possible form of the momentum wave function .",
    "our prediction is compared with the calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite ( dotted line ) and in ref .",
    "@xcite ( dot - dashed line ) .",
    "while the former curve nearly coincides with our power - law wave function result , the latter calculation gives a much smaller charge form factor . the cebaf experiment ( e-93 - 018 )",
    "may be able to distinguish between these different predictions .",
    "our formalism is suited for both light and heavy quarks , so that we also present the charge form factors for the d- and b - mesons in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] and [ fig:6 ] .",
    "note the different scale in the momentum transfer .",
    "the wave function dependence for the d- and b - mesons is very small even for very high momentum transfer .",
    "a main emphasis of this paper is to choose the same parameters as ref .",
    "@xcite , so that all the precise results obtained in that paper are preserved . for instance , the explicit calculation of the weak @xmath54 transition form factor gives @xmath55 and @xmath56 fm@xmath1 for the ho wave function  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath58 decay , one may neglect the electron mass in the calculation of the rate , which then depends only on the form factor @xmath14 .",
    "the corresponding value @xmath59 of the km quark - mixing matrix is @xmath60  @xcite .",
    "the error for @xmath59 originates in the uncertainty of the strange quark mass in the constituent quark model .",
    "we extend the simple relativistic quark model described in ref .  @xcite to investigate the charge form factors of the pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "most of the parameters are fixed by these previous studies of the model .",
    "we notice an approximate independence of the momentum wave function for a large @xmath49-range .",
    "the charge form factors do not depend on the high momentum tail of the wave function , but rather on the confinement scale @xmath34 .",
    "the validity of this model has also been tested in other systems such as mesons having nonzero angular momentum  @xcite and baryons  @xcite . in conclusion , this model provides a remarkably good description of the electroweak properties of hadrons , although it is both conceptually and computationally simple .",
