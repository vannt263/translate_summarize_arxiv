    "in the classical formulation of communication over a noisy channel @xcite , the transmitter chooses a message from the set of possible messages , encodes and transmits the corresponding codeword over the channel .",

    "if the decoded message is not same as the transmitted one , we declare an error . alternatively ,",
    "if the receiver can not decide reliably the transmitted message , it can choose to produce a list of possible messages .",
    "this is known as _ list decoding _",
    ", where the main goal is to achieve a trade - off between the probability of error , defined as the transmitted message not being in the list , and the list size .",

    "error exponent of list decoding is recently presented in @xcite , which also includes a survey of the literature .    in this work ,",
    "we introduce a more general communication setup in which the transmitter chooses a subset of size @xmath0 of all possible @xmath1 messages .",
    "the receiver forms a list ( set ) size @xmath2 and communication is considered successful if the size of the intersection of the transmitter and receiver sets is larger than a certain threshold @xmath3 .",

    "this kind of communication may appear in various scenarios ; for example in a wireless network to alert a user about @xmath0 available resource blocks among @xmath1 possible ones , where the user is interested in a total of @xmath3 of the resource blocks and is willing to go through a list of @xmath2 .",
    "another possible scenario can be an internet search engine generating an unordered list of links size @xmath0 for a query which is transmitted over a noisy channel .",
    "the user is presented with a list of @xmath2 links and is satisfied as long as any @xmath3 of the @xmath2 results presented are relevant to his query .    in this paper , we are interested in conditions on @xmath1 , @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 that guarantee an asymptotically vanishing probability of communication failure .",
