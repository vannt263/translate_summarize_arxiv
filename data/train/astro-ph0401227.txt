    "we examined optical images of the cluster region and found a concentration of highly reddened galaxies coincident with the central part of xmmu j004624.8 + 420420 , further supporting our interpretation .",
    "in addition , we found a relatively bright radio source nvss j004625 + 420406 ( @xcite ) located only @xmath102 away from the emission center of xmmu j004624.8 + 420420 , indicating that it might be radio galaxy belonging to the cluster .",
    "the majority of the remaining 18 x - ray sources detected in our survey consists of agn in the background of m31 or x - ray binaries belonging to the galaxy .",
    "for some of these sources there is a close stellar - like counterpart ( sources @xmath103 ) , indicating possible agn origin . for the source",

    "could be explained by agn intrinsic obscuration .",
    "more reliable optical identifications of these obscured agn candidates are needed to confirm or reject their agn nature .",
    "in order to facilitate comparison between spectral properties of different source classes detected in our observations of the northern disk of m31 , we constructed their x - ray color - color diagram .",

    "figure [ colors ] shows the x - ray color - color diagram for bright x - ray sources detected in the _ xmm - newton_/epic - pn observations of the northern disk of m31 .",

    "the other densely populated group includes harder sources : gcs , radio sources and unidentified sources ( presumably background agn and x - ray binaries in m31 ) .",
    "the x - ray pulsar candidate ( possible hmxb ) demonstrates harder and much more absorbed spectrum , and lies at an extreme position with @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "[ colors ] demonstrates that in most cases it is difficult to establish source type using x - ray color alone .",
    "although it helps to outline the difference between sources with soft and hard spectra ( like thermal supernova remnants and stars vs. typical high - mass x - ray binaries or black hole candidates in a hard state ) , it shows no difference between other physically different classes like , for example , x - ray binaries and crab - like supernova remnants .",
    "the combination of low - energy absorption and limited instrument bandpass have significant effect on the source position on the color - color diagram ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the source with intrinsically super - soft spectrum , if highly absorbed , can easily `` migrate '' to the region on the color diagram normally occupied by sources with much harder spectra ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , additional information , such as x - ray variability , luminosity and source counterparts at other wavelengths , is needed to classify the x - ray source .",
    "previous x - ray studies of m31 were mostly concentrated on the central region of the galaxy .",
    "they revealed the presence of the unresolved soft x - ray emission component in the bulge of m31 distinct from the emission of point - like sources ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the situation with the outer disk of m31 is less clear .",
    "previous observations were not sensitive enough or lacked spatial resolution to fully address a question of the existence of the diffuse x - ray component in the disk . using the data of _ einstein _ observations , trinchieri @xmath112 fabbiano ( 1991 ) found no requirement for a diffuse component after exclusion of the detected point - like sources . based on the later observations with _ rosat_/pspc , west , barber @xmath112 folgheraiter ( 1997 ) report on a detection of a residual unresolved x - ray emission from the outer disk of m31 .",
    "they conclude that the bulk of this emission could be attributed to the normal stars in the disk of m31 .    the observation of m31 north 1 field revealed the presence of soft unresolved soft x - ray emission from the disk of m31 .",
    "the unresolved emission follows the pattern of the spiral structure and can be traced up to the distance of @xmath4 ( @xmath5 kpc at 760 kpc ) from the center of the galaxy ( fig .",

    "the unresolved emission includes a large region along the major axis of m31 and a number of smaller regions in the spiral arms .",
    "the unresolved emission covers the `` inner star - forming ring '' of m31 ( @xcite ) and has several local enhancements that are clearly associated with regions of recent star formation ( @xcite ) .    to characterize the diffuse emission from the disk of m31 , we extracted the epic - pn spectrum from @xmath113 arcmin@xmath114 region in the disk at the projected distance of @xmath115 kpc from the center , using the background region outside the disk and eliminating point - like sources from both the source and background regions . to reduce contamination from faint snr , regions containing undetected optical snr candidates ( braun & walterbos 1993 ; magnier et al .",

    "the spectrum of the unresolved emission is soft and shows possible presence of spectral lines .",
    "a crude approximation of its shape in the @xmath37 kev energy range with a power law model gives a value of photon index of @xmath116 .",
    "the spectrum of unresolved emission can be adequately approximated by two - component spectral model including the raymond - smith optically thin thermal plasma emission model with a temperature of @xmath117 kev and normalized @xmath37 kev flux of @xmath118 ergs s@xmath3 @xmath30 arcmin@xmath119 and a weak power law component with photon index of @xmath120 contributing @xmath121 of the total luminosity in the @xmath37 kev energy band ( fig .",

    "the spectrum of unresolved emission differs significantly from the cumulative spectrum of faint point - like sources in the same region , which can be presented by absorbed power law model of photon index @xmath122 and absorbing column density @xmath123 .",
    "the spectral properties of the unresolved emission are somewhat similar to that of the thermal snr detected in our observations ( see section 6 ) , but both selection procedure and great spatial extent of the unresolved emission make serious spectral contamination from snr unlikely .",
    "this argues strongly that the bulk of the diffuse x - ray emission in the disk of m31 is not simply due to the faint , unresolved x - ray binaries and snr .",
    "it suggests that there is a significant hot interstellar gas contribution to the diffuse emission , analogous to the hot gas components found in the center of m31 ( @xcite ) , in the disk of m33 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and in our own galaxy .",
    "another significant contributor to the diffuse emission component could be x - ray emission from normal stars in the disk of m31 ( @xcite ) .",
    "a weak power law component in the spectrum of unresolved emission still can be due to the combined effect of faint x - ray binaries below our detection limit and some remaining contribution from extracted point - like sources .",
