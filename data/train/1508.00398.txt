    "attractive interaction between fermions lead to pairing and a superfluid or superconducting ground state .",
    "if the interaction strength is large the pairing effects show up at a high temperature , @xmath0 , via a pseudogap in the density of states , while the transition to a superfluid occurs at a lower temperature @xmath1 . between @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "the pseudogap deepens and for @xmath2 one expects a full gap in the density of states .",
    "the loss in low energy spectral weight with reducing temperature is monotonic @xcite .",
    "since the pairing occurs between time reversed states @xmath3 and @xmath4 an imbalance in the population of the ` up ' and ` down ' species , with the total fixed , tends to reduce the pairing amplitude and the @xmath1 .",
    "the imbalance can be achieved by applying a magnetic field , as in the solid state @xcite , or by loading different numbers of up and down fermions into a trap - as in cold atom experiments @xcite .",
    "the effect of increasing field , @xmath5 , or growing population imbalance , @xmath6 , is qualitatively similar : it suppresses the @xmath1 of the homogeneous superfluid ( sf ) , promotes a ` phase modulated ' fulde - ferrell ( ff ) or an ` amplitude modulated ' larkin - ovchinnikov ( lo ) state in the intermediate @xmath6 regime , and finally destroys pairing altogether @xcite .",
    "there are also crucial differences .",
    "for example , while there is a stable ground state for _ all applied fields _ , there is no stable ground state for polarization @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the threshold polarization of the fflo state . at zero temperature",
    "the system can either be an unpolarised ( homogeneous ) superfluid ( usf ) with @xmath9 , or a modulated state with @xmath10 , or a homogeneous ` normal ' state with @xmath11 .",
    "there is an unstable ( phase separation ) window @xmath7 .",
    "this window shrinks with increasing temperature vanishing at a tricritical point .",
    "the general features are well understood theoretically @xcite and have been verified in cold fermi gases at unitarity @xcite .",
    "what is less well known is the changing spectral character of the imbalanced sf with increasing temperature .",
    "we establish this for the two dimensional attractive hubbard model at intermediate coupling , where the @xmath1 is highest , using a monte carlo approach .",
    "we discover the following :    1 .   at low imbalance",
    "the homogeneous superfluid is stable only above some temperature @xmath12 and for @xmath13 has a pseudogap with a strange non monotonic low energy density of states .",
    "heating this leads to a crossover to a more conventional pseudogap phase with a monotonic energy dependence .",
    "2 .   for @xmath14 , where the ground state is fflo ,",
    "increasing temperature generates multiple crossovers : from the ` pseudogapped ' fflo to a gapless normal state , and , beyond a higher temperature , to another pseudogapped normal state .",
    "3 .   the non paired ground state , with @xmath11 , is gapless but on heating develops a weak pseudogap beyond a certain temperature .",
    "this phase is observed in a situation where there is no order at any temperature , _",
    "i.e _ , @xmath15 .",
    "we study the attractive two dimensional hubbard model on a square lattice in the presence of a magnetic field : @xmath16 with , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 only for nearest neighbor hopping and is zero otherwise .",
    "we will set @xmath20 as the reference energy scale .",
    "@xmath21 is the chemical potential and @xmath5 is the applied magnetic field in the @xmath22 direction . @xmath23 is the strength of on - site attraction .",
    "we will use @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "we have discussed our method of solving the model in detail elsewhere @xcite so we touch on it only briefly .",
    "we use a ` single channel ' hubbard - stratonovich ( hs ) decomposition of the interaction in terms of an auxiliary complex scalar field @xmath27 .",
    "this maps the original interacting problem to that of non interacting fermions in a space - time fluctuating field @xmath28 , the price to pay is the additional ` averaging ' over all configurations of @xmath28 .",
    "quantum monte carlo performs this averaging without further approximation , mean field theory ( mft ) restricts @xmath28 to a time independent spatially periodic function , and dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) treats @xmath28 as a ` single site ' time dependent function @xmath29 .",
    "we drop the ` time ' dependence of @xmath30 , but retain the full spatial dependence : @xmath31 .",
    "this corresponds to dropping quantum fluctuations but retaining all the classical thermal fluctuations .",
    "equivalently one can think of fourier transforming the @xmath28 into bosonic matsubara modes @xmath32 and our approach corresponds to retaining the @xmath33 mode .",
    "this has been called a ` static path approximation ' ( spa ) @xcite to the functional integral for the partition function .",
    "spa retains classical fluctuations of arbitrary magnitude , around the saddle point , but no quantum ( @xmath34 ) fluctuation . at @xmath35 , since the classical fluctuations die off , spa reduces to standard bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) mean field theory ( mft ) . for @xmath36",
    ", however , it considers not only the saddle point configuration but _ all _ configurations involving classical amplitude and phase fluctuations of the order parameter .",
    "the bdg equations are solved in all these configurations to compute the thermally averaged properties .",
    "this approach suppresses the order parameter much quicker than mft .",
    "also , since the @xmath37 mode dominates the exact partition function , spa becomes exact as @xmath38 .",
    "the approximation leads to the coupled equations : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the stiffness cost associated with the now classical auxiliary field .",
    "the upper equation describes fermions in a pairing background @xmath41 , while the lower equation defines the probability distribution @xmath42 associated with a @xmath43 configuration .",
    "we generate samples of @xmath43 using a metropolis algorithm , diagonalising @xmath44 for the update cost . in order to make the study numerically less expensive the monte carlo",
    "is implemented using a cluster approximation @xcite .",
    "after equilibriation at a given @xmath45 we calculate the following : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the polarization ( not be confused with the probability distribution of the pairing field discussed later ) , @xmath48 is the pairing structure factor , and @xmath49 is the up spin density of states ( dos ) .",
    "the down spin dos is symmetrically shifted .",
    "@xmath50 are the usual bdg eigenfunctions and @xmath51 are the bdg eigenvalues in an equilibrium configuration .",
    "angular brackets indicate thermal average .",
    "notice that the dos is also the @xmath52-summed spectral function @xmath53 .",
    "formally , @xmath54 with , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the imaginary frequency transform of @xmath57 .",
    "the bdg quasiparticles are related to the original fermions via the eigenfunction matrix so the green s function and spectral functions can be readily computed @xcite .     - temperature @xmath58 phase diagram of the intermediate coupling attractive hubbard model @xmath59 and @xmath26 in two dimensions .",
    "the thermodynamic phases include a homogeneous superfluid , fflo states , a partially polarized fermi liquid ( ppfl ) , and an ` unstable ' phase separated region .",
    "the spin resolved density of states can either have a hard gap , pseudogaps of different character , pg - a or pg - b ( see text ) , or be gapless .",
    "the superfluid to ppfl transition is indicated as @xmath60 and @xmath61 , for 2nd and 1st order transitions respectively , and the unstable to superfluid boundary as @xmath62 .",
    "the pg - a to pg - b crossover within the superfluid is denoted as @xmath63 and the gapless to pseudogap crossover at large @xmath6 denoted as @xmath64 .",
    "the variation of @xmath65 at fixed @xmath6 can take the system through different pseudogap regimes .",
    ", width=302,height=264 ]    we wish to probe results at fixed @xmath6 , for varying @xmath65 , as would be the case in population imbalanced cold fermi gases . within",
    "the hamiltonian formulation @xmath6 is a derived quantity , dependent on @xmath66 and the other model parameters .",
    "we therefore solve the @xmath67 problem first and then _ construct _ a @xmath68 phase diagram out of it .    since mean field theory is widely used to study the imbalanced fermi gas it is useful to point out that , apart from the gross overestimate of @xmath1 , mean field theory predicts that the homogeneous sf is _ always gapped _ , and the normal state _",
    "always gapless_. the notion of a pseudogap does not figure in it @xcite .",
    "fig.1 shows the @xmath68 phase diagram inferred from the @xmath67 phase diagram ( shown later , and also in ref .",
    "while the thermodynamic phase boundaries are determined based on @xmath69 , the various crossovers are determined based on the behavior of the dos .",
    "a suppression in the density of states around the fermi level ( but not a hard gap ) is characterized as a pseudogap ( pg ) . in our case",
    "we classify the pseudogaps as pg - a and pg - b depending on the detailed spectral behavior in the subgap region . considering the @xmath70 window , pg - a has a minimum at @xmath71 , a local maximum at a low energy @xmath72 , a second minimum at an energy @xmath73 , say , and then the gap edge coherence features .",
    "pg - b involves a minimum only at @xmath71 .",
    "we first recapitulate the ground state then move to thermal properties .      in terms of an applied magnetic field ,",
    "the ground state is a homogeneous unpolarised sf for fields @xmath74 . at @xmath75",
    "it makes a transition to a finite polarization fflo state , with @xmath76 .",
    "the fflo regime is from @xmath75 to @xmath77 , with the polarization growing from @xmath8 to @xmath78 , and beyond @xmath77 the ground state has no pairing and is a partially polarized fermi liquid ( ppfl ) .    in terms of polarization , at @xmath35 the entire @xmath79 region , with @xmath9 ,",
    "collapses to the origin .",
    "the polarization regime @xmath7 is unstable , with no homogeneous phase allowed , followed by the fflo and ppfl at higher @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath9 superfluid is gapped , the fflo has ` pseudogaps ' , _",
    "depression in its dos due to the spatial modulation , while the ppfl is gapless .      at finite @xmath65",
    "the homogeneous sf does allow finite polarization and is called the ` breached pair ' ( bp ) state @xcite .",
    "it occupies an increasing @xmath6 window , as @xmath65 increases , at the expense of the unstable region .",
    "the temperature above which the sf is stable is @xmath12 . at an even higher temperature , @xmath60",
    ", superfluidity is lost through a berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition .",
    "we infer the @xmath1 scale from @xmath80 .",
    "the upper right edge of the unstable region defines the scale , @xmath61 , for a first order transition between the sf and the normal state .",
    "the fflo has a very low @xmath1 and transits to a gapless normal state on heating .",
    "this gapless phase defines a large part of the high @xmath6 low temperature window .",
    "the sf phase can be gapped or pseudogapped as fig.1 shows , the fflo is pseudogapped , while the ppfl is gapless at low @xmath65 and pseudogapped at high @xmath65 .",
    "we will discuss the origin of these behavior in the discussion section , but the phase diagram indicates that varying temperature at a fixed polarization can lead to multiple changes in spectral character .",
    "this is directly relevant for cold fermi gases where one works at fixed imbalance rather than a fixed applied field @xcite .",
    "fig.2 shows the spin resolved dos for fixed @xmath6 cross sections through the @xmath68 phase diagram in fig.1 .",
    "two of the panel , ( a ) and ( d ) , traverse the bp part of the phase diagram , ( e ) starts with a fflo ground state , while ( f ) has a ppfl ground state .",
    "the ground states vary widely , we discuss the cases one by one .",
    "fig.2(a ) is for @xmath81 .",
    "the @xmath35 state in this case would be in the unstable window and stable phases are defined in this case only for @xmath82 .",
    "all the way from this temperature to @xmath83 the system is a bp superfluid .",
    "the behavior of the dos , however , changes multiple times",
    ". for @xmath84 the ( shifted ) dos has its absolute minimum at @xmath71 but then a local maximum at a small scale @xmath72 ( see plot ) and a local minimum after that at @xmath73 and then the sharp rise at the gap edge .",
    "while subgap density of states by itself is not surprising this additional feature is unusual . increasing @xmath65 beyond @xmath85 leads to a more common pg with a monotonic increase in @xmath86 as @xmath87 increases .",
    "fig.2(b ) focuses on the low energy behavior of the data in 2(a ) .",
    "the lower scales clearly reveal the non monotonic dos at low @xmath65 .",
    "we fitted this behavior to an approximate form @xmath88 , and , after extracting the coefficients @xmath89 , plotted the derivative @xmath90 in fig.2(c ) .",
    "the multiple zero crossings in the low @xmath65 data highlight the multiple extrema .",
    "phase diagram showing the varying @xmath91 that is needed to maintain the polarization fixed at the values chosen in fig.2 . in general when pairing effects are strong and the low @xmath65 phase is a bp superfluid the magnetic field has to sharply rise with reducing @xmath65 to maintain @xmath6 fixed .",
    "this is clearly visible for @xmath92 and weakly so for @xmath93 .",
    "in the higher field regime , where the low @xmath65 state is fflo or ppfl the magnetic field needs to increase somewhat with _ increasing _ @xmath65 , as in a normal metal , to maintain a fixed @xmath6 .",
    "the shaded region within the bp phase roughly correspond to the anomalous pg phase ( see text for details ) .",
    ", width=302,height=264 ]    the result in fig.2(d ) is at @xmath93 .",
    "the stable bp window at this @xmath6 starts at @xmath94 .",
    "heating this bp state leads to a 2nd order transition at @xmath95 .",
    "all the way from @xmath94 through @xmath1 to high temperature in the ppfl phase the system is pseudogapped , with the character that we called pg - b , with monotonic @xmath86 .",
    "the coherence peaks vanish , the depth of the pseudogap lessens , and the low energy weight increases with increasing @xmath65 .",
    "fig.2(e ) is for @xmath96 .",
    "the ground state in this case is an axial stripe lo phase , with @xmath97 .",
    "the periodic modulation of @xmath41 in the low @xmath65 state leads to multiple bands and a redistribution of the tight binding spectral weight .",
    "the presence of a finite @xmath98 modulation leads to pairing of fermions between @xmath99 and @xmath100 states ( rather than the time reversed @xmath101 and @xmath102 ) and give rise to multiple branches in the dispersion .",
    "some of these branches cross the fermi level leading to a finite but depressed dos around @xmath103 .",
    "this is not a fluctuation induced pseudogap but a ` band structure ' effect .",
    "the @xmath65 window immediately above @xmath1 , @xmath104 $ ] , in fig.2(e ) , is gapless .",
    "the pairing field is small and disordered and does not affect the dos noticeably .",
    "however , at the two highest temperatures in fig.2.(e ) a weak pseudogap again emerges .",
    "this is due to the thermally induced growth in the mean magnitude @xmath105 with the phase variables @xmath106 remaining random . at this polarization",
    "one has a pseudogap - gapless - pseudogap re - entrance with increasing temperature .",
    "finally , fig.2(f ) at @xmath107 has a non ordered ground state with no @xmath41 at any site .",
    "this is a system at strong interaction , @xmath108 , where the imbalance suppresses pairing at @xmath35 . as a result",
    "the low temperature phase is gapless . with increasing @xmath65",
    "the @xmath105 grows quickly , as in the fflo window , and leads to a pseudogap for @xmath109 .",
    "this is a simple instance of a pseudogap emerging without the presence of any order in the low temperature state .",
    "we first discuss the origin of the effects seen in fig.1 and fig.2 , and then earlier theory efforts and experimental data on this topic .",
    "fig.3 shows the field - temperature phase diagram from which the @xmath68 phase diagram is derived .",
    "the basic phases have been discussed earlier in ref .",
    "it is included here mainly to show the rather unusual @xmath67 paths that lie behind the constant @xmath6 cross sections in fig.1 .",
    "at @xmath92 the low @xmath65 part of the trajectory passes close to the bp - lo phase boundary .",
    "we explored the @xmath67 neighborhood and discovered that in the window shaded grey the dos indeed displays the peculiar features observed in fig.2(a ) .",
    "the proximity to the bp - lo phase boundary , at finite @xmath65 , suggests that while much of the @xmath41 would have ( large ) values appropriate to the bp phase , there could be a small fraction of sites that have the lower values appropriate to the lo phase .",
    "we will examine this aspect in the distributions later .",
    "the @xmath110 trajectory transits from a high @xmath65 bp phase to the ppfl . the slope of the @xmath91 curve is much smaller than for @xmath111 due to the weaker suppression of pauli susceptibility .",
    "the @xmath96 system passes from a low @xmath65 lo phase to a ppfl , while the @xmath112 path is always in a unordered phase but displays a high @xmath65 pseudogap due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "for these two cases , where the ground state does not have pauli susceptibility suppression , the @xmath91 curves generally have a weak positive slope . in this window",
    "the ` mysterious ' effect is the presence of a high @xmath65 pseudogap above a gapless low temperature state .",
    "addressing this requires a look at the pairing field distributions .",
    "fig.4 shows the distribution of the pairing field for the different fixed @xmath6 cross sections shown in fig.2 .",
    "fig.4.(a ) shows the pairing field distributions for dos shown in fig.2.(a ) , and so on for the other panels .",
    "the anomalous low energy features in fig.2(a ) , we believe , arise from the relatively large number of _ small @xmath41 _ sites in a typical configuration in this part of parameter space .",
    "this arises due to the proximity to the low @xmath30 fflo state . while the mean @xmath30 is @xmath113 ( the @xmath35 mean field value ) , at @xmath114 in fig.4(a ) , if the system were fully in the lo regime , fig.4(c ) , the mean @xmath30 would be @xmath115 , see the plot for @xmath116 .",
    "we think that proximity to the lo phase boundary makes the system have a small fraction of small @xmath30 sites whose magnitude is @xmath117 the typical value . as a result the dos generates weight at an energy @xmath72 that is roughly @xmath118 the gap edge value . since the @xmath92 trajectory is the only one that borders the bp - lo boundary the effect is not visible at other @xmath6 .",
    "fig.4.(b ) shows a monotonic increase in the width of @xmath119 with increasing @xmath65 , and the increasing ` disorder ' in the pairing field steadily weakens the pg in the dos and increases the low energy spectral weight . in fig.4.(c )",
    "the lowest @xmath65 shows the ` multimode ' distribution of the amplitude modulated lo state . at this , and the next higher @xmath65 , the lo modulations lead to a ` pseudogapped ' phase but with the loss of order at the first order transition , @xmath120 , the mean amplitude collapses .",
    "a gapless state emerges , and survives to some larger temperature , where the thermal fluctuations have created enough large @xmath41 sites to generate a weak pseudogap .",
    "the behavior in 4.(d ) is essentially similar to 4.(c ) , with the lo part removed : in this case one just has a gapless to weak pg crossover .",
    "much of the earlier work on pseudogaps in imbalanced superfluids is in the continuum context .",
    "a _ thermodynamic re - entrance _ has been pointed out in the continuum unitary gas @xcite at low @xmath6 .",
    "the authors there had carried out an extensive investigation in terms of interaction strength @xmath121 , polarization , and temperature and observed that near @xmath122 the low @xmath6 superfluid state has an upper and lower bound in temperature @xcite . at @xmath123",
    "there is no stable superfluid , while an intermediate sf phase is realized at @xmath36 .",
    "the superfluid is gapped ( by construction in this theory ) the higher and lower @xmath65 ` normal ' states are pseudogapped .",
    "the present theory allows for pairing field fluctuations , consequently we find that within the sf phase the spectrum is not always gapped out completely and there are finite low energy weight even at the lowest accessible temperature . despite the different model , a quite different approximation , and a thermodynamic stability ( rather than spectral change ) argument offered by the authors , we think the similarity with our result is not coincidental .",
    "the changing spectral character at the small polarization regime bears closer experimental search .",
    "the spectrum in imbalanced superconductors can be probed by tunneling but we are not aware of such studies .",
    "spectral studies are more visible in cold atomic superfluids , although the results are complicated by the effect of a trap .",
    "the experiments measure a ` radio frequency ' ( rf ) current @xcite , rather than the density of states .",
    "however , the rf response @xmath124 is a weighted sum @xcite of the same spectral function @xmath125 that defines our density of states @xmath126 .",
    "experiments on the unitary fermi gas indicate that the @xmath1 falls from @xmath127 at @xmath9 to zero at @xmath128 .",
    "the ` pair formation ' scale @xmath0 , however , seems to be @xmath129 _ even when @xmath6 crosses @xmath130 and @xmath1 falls to zero _ @xcite .",
    "these experiments suggest that a pg is obtained over a wide temperature window all the way from @xmath9 to the highest @xmath6 .",
    "our results agree with this , except at the high @xmath6 end where we observe a gapless low temperature state .",
    "this difference arises from our neglect of quantum fluctuations in the @xmath28 , which can generate a non trivial fermi liquid ground state @xcite , preserving pairing but suppressing condensation .",
    "the results discussed in this paper correspond to a lattice size of @xmath131 .",
    "the system size is reasonable in comparison to the existing literature in which the thermal physics of spin imbalanced system are being explored @xcite . in order to verify the robustness of the spectral features , we have further computed our results on various other system sizes .",
    "fig.(5 ) shows the spin resolved dos calculated at three different lattice sizes of @xmath132 and @xmath133 , for a fixed polarization , highlighting three different temperature regimes .",
    "we observed that the anomalous behavior of the spin resolved dos is fairly robust and persists even at @xmath134 , and is not an artifact of finite size effect .",
    "we have established the thermal phase diagram of population imbalanced lattice fermions near the bcs - bec crossover and observed that although the thermodynamic phases exhibit expected behavior with temperature the spectral features are very counter - intuitive .",
    "the low temperature superfluid at a fixed small polarization has a pseudogap with a distinct maximum in the density of states in the subgap region , crossing over to a more conventional featureless pseudogap with increasing temperature .",
    "the unusual low ( but finite ) temperature result arises due to lo like fluctuations in the bp phase near the bp - lo boundary . at large polarization , in the lo phase",
    ", the system undergoes a pseudogap to gapless to pseudogap crossover with increasing temperature , at even larger polarization , where the ground state is gapless and has no pairing and long range order , heating the system leads to pseudogap formation above a certain temperature .",
    "all these effects are a consequence of thermal fluctuations beyond the mean field scheme usually used to analyze these models .",

    "<S> in a fermi superfluid increasing population imbalance leads initially to reduction of the transition temperature , then the appearance of modulated fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) states , and finally the suppression of pairing itself . for interaction strength </S>",
    "<S> such that the ` balanced ' system has a normal state pseudogap , increasing imbalance reveals anomalous spectral behavior . at a fixed weak imbalance ( small polarization ) </S>",
    "<S> the stable homogeneous superfluid occurs only above a certain temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the density of states has a minimum at the fermi level , then a weak peak _ within the gap _ , and then the large , gap edge , coherence features . on heating , </S>",
    "<S> this non monotonic energy dependence changes to a more conventional fluctuation driven pseudogap , with a monotonic energy dependence . at large imbalance </S>",
    "<S> the ground state is fflo and ` pseudogapped ' due to the modulated order . </S>",
    "<S> it changes to a gapless normal state on heating , and then shows a pseudogap again at a higher temperature . </S>",
    "<S> these weak imbalance and strong imbalance features both involve effects well beyond mean field theory . </S>",
    "<S> we establish them by using a monte carlo technique on large lattices , motivate the results in terms of the pairing field distribution , and compare them to spectroscopic results in the imbalanced unitary fermi gas . </S>"
