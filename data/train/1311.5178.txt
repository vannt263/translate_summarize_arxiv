    "the purpose of this note is to exhibit ( elementary ) examples of @xmath3th - order linear differential operators @xmath4 acting on @xmath1 that can be regarded as higher order analogues of the exterior derivative complex @xmath5 ( here @xmath6 and @xmath7 stand for the @xmath8-forms and @xmath9-forms on @xmath1 whose coefficients are smooth and compactly supported . )",
    "more precisely we require that , for each @xmath3 , @xmath10 map @xmath8-forms to @xmath9-forms and @xmath11 ; that the hodge laplacian for @xmath10 , namely the operator @xmath12 , be elliptic , and that the first - order operator in this family be the exterior derivative ( that is , @xmath13 ) .",
    "we also require that @xmath10 and @xmath14 have non - trivial invariance properties and satisfy so - called @xmath2-duality estimates as well as div - curl inequalities ( more on these below ) .",
    "while various operators satisfying one or more of these conditions were recently constructed for any order @xmath15 , see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite-@xcite , those operators fail to be invariant under pullback by the rotations of @xmath1 as soon as @xmath16 .",
    "by contrast , here we define linear differential operators @xmath10 of _ odd _ order @xmath17 that have the same invariance properties as the codifferential @xmath18 ( the @xmath19-adjoint of exterior derivative ) as soon as @xmath20 ( i.e. @xmath21 ) ; that is @xmath22 for any isometry @xmath23 ( as customary , @xmath24 denotes the pullback of @xmath25 acting on @xmath8-forms ) . while such invariance is non - trivial , it is far weaker than the invariance of @xmath26 , which indeed is what should be expected of any linear differential operator of order greater than 1 , see ( * ? ? ? * note 4 ) and @xcite .",
    "+ specifically , given @xmath27 , we define @xmath28 it is clear that @xmath29 and , more generally , that @xmath30 takes @xmath8-forms to @xmath9-forms and @xmath31 .",
    "it is also clear that the hodge laplacian for @xmath30 is @xmath32 where the composition above is performed @xmath33-many times and @xmath34 is the hodge laplacian for the exterior derivative , so in particular @xmath35 is elliptic because it is the composition of elliptic operators @xcite .",
    "+ note , however , that @xmath36 see , and so the natural compatibility conditions for the data of the hodge system for @xmath30 and @xmath37 are the same as for the system for @xmath26 and @xmath18 . as a consequence ,",
    "the @xmath2-duality inequalities that are relevant to the hodge system for @xmath30 and @xmath37 are the same as in @xcite and @xcite , namely    [ p : ls ] there is @xmath38 such that for any @xmath39 and for any @xmath40 @xmath41 for any @xmath42 such that @xmath43 .",

    "+ we take this opportunity to point out that these inequalities can be restated in the seemingly more invariant , in fact equivalent , fashion ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1  ) )    [ p : ll ] there is @xmath56 such that for any @xmath39 and for any @xmath40 @xmath57 for any @xmath42 such that @xmath58 .",

    "+ we remark in closing that one could also consider the operators @xmath93 but these fail to map @xmath8-forms to @xmath9-forms and do not form a complex and as such are of not pertinent to this note .",
