    "in earlier work @xcite we presented a method to analyze the performance of a microswimmer modeled as an assembly of @xmath0 rigid spheres immersed in a viscous incompressible fluid of infinite extent , with a no - slip boundary condition on the surface of each sphere .",
    "the motion of the whole system is determined by the stokes equations of low reynolds number hydrodynamics .",
    "the swimming motion of such a system was discussed earlier by alouges et al . @xcite,@xcite . the particular case of collinear spheres",
    "was studied by vladimirov @xcite using a two - timing method .    for small displacements of the spheres from fixed positions in the collective rest frame",
    "the time - averaged swimming velocity and rate of dissipation can be evaluated in terms of a @xmath1 velocity matrix and a @xmath1 power matrix , which can be constructed from the mobility matrix for each relative rest configuration @xcite .",
    "optimization of the velocity at fixed power leads to a generalized eigenvalue problem involving the two matrices .",
    "optimal efficiency corresponds to the maximum eigenvalue .    in a model with",
    "harmonically interacting spheres the optimal stroke of small amplitude motion can be used to calculate a set of corresponding actuating forces .",
    "large amplitude motion can be studied by solving the equations of stokesian dynamics for the same actuating forces multiplied by a factor .",
    "the mean swimming velocity and the mean power of the large amplitude motion can then be determined numerically from the limit cycle of the solution .    in the following",
    "we present an alternative method based on a purely kinematic point of view .",
    "expressions are derived for the instantaneous swimming velocity and power in terms of the sphere displacements from the center and their instantaneous time derivative .",
    "this allows calculation of the mean swimming velocity and mean power for given periodic stroke of any amplitude .",
    "the present method also provides an alternative derivation of the velocity matrix and power matrix of small amplitude motion .    for large amplitude swimming the present method",
    "is more straightforward than the earlier one @xcite , since it does not require numerical solution of the equations of stokesian dynamics .",
    "a large amplitude stroke may be determined by amplifying the optimal stroke found from the eigenvalue problem of the small amplitude theory for a given equilibrium structure .",
    "the instantaneous swimming velocity and power are then determined from explicit expressions in terms of the given displacements .",
    "subsequently the mean swimming velocity and mean power can be found by integration over a period .",
    "both methods are tested on a model of three collinear spheres with motion along the common axis , as formulated by najafi and golestanian @xcite and studied in detail by golestanian and ajdari @xcite .",
    "the two methods of calculation lead to similar numerical results for a wide range of amplitude .",
    "we consider a set of @xmath0 rigid spheres of radii @xmath2 immersed in a viscous incompressible fluid of shear viscosity @xmath3 .",
    "the fluid is of infinite extent in all directions . at low reynolds number and",
    "on a slow time scale the flow velocity @xmath4 and the pressure @xmath5 satisfy the stokes equations @xcite @xmath6 the flow velocity @xmath4 is assumed to satisfy the no - slip boundary condition on the surface of the spheres .",
    "the fluid is set in motion by time - dependent motions of the spheres . at each time @xmath7",
    "the velocity field @xmath8 tends to zero at infinity , and the pressure @xmath9 tends to the constant ambient pressure @xmath10",
    ". we shall study periodic relative motions which lead to swimming motion of the collection of spheres .",
    "we assume that the motion is caused by time - dependent periodic forces @xmath11 which satisfy the condition that their sum vanishes at any time .",
    "the forces are transmitted by the spheres to the fluid .",
    "the spheres can rotate freely , so that they exert no torques on the fluid .",
    "hence the rotational velocities @xmath12 can be ignored .",
    "the translational velocities @xmath13 are linearly related to the forces , @xmath14 with translational mobility tensors @xmath15 .",
    "the tensors have many - body character and depend in principle on the positions of all particles @xcite-@xcite . by translational invariance only relative distance vectors",
    "@xmath16 occur in the functional dependence .",
    "we abbreviate eq .",
    "( 2.2 ) as @xmath17 with a symmetric @xmath18 mobility matrix @xmath19 .",
    "conversely @xmath20 with friction matrix @xmath21 .",
    "the friction matrix is the inverse of the mobility matrix , @xmath22 , and is also symmetric",
    ".    the positions of the centers change as a function of time .",
    "the equations of motion of stokesian dynamics read @xmath23 the explicit time - dependence on the right originates in the time - dependence of the forces @xmath24 . in the swimming motion",
    "the forces are periodic in time with period @xmath25 , so that @xmath26 .",
    "as mentioned , we impose the condition that at no time is there a net force acting on the set of spheres , so that @xmath27 we look for a solution of eq . ( 2.5 ) corresponding to swimming motion , of the form @xmath28 where the first two terms describe the collective motion of the configuration @xmath29 with swimming velocity @xmath30 caused by the displacements @xmath31 .",
    "we require that the latter are periodic with period @xmath25 , and exclude uniform displacements , so that the @xmath32-dimensional vector @xmath33 satisfies @xmath34 where the symbol @xmath35 denotes a @xmath32-dimensional vector with @xmath36 on the @xmath37 positions , @xmath38 on the @xmath39 positions , and cyclic .",
    "periodicity implies @xmath40 the mean swimming velocity is defined as @xmath41 we require that @xmath42 is purely oscillating , so that @xmath43    we show in the following that the instantaneous swimming velocity @xmath30 can be calculated from the displacement vector @xmath42 and its time derivative @xmath44 .",
    "later we compare the present kinematic description to a dynamical model , in which the forces are decomposed into actuating forces and elastic restoring forces .",
    "by substitution of eq . ( 2.7 ) into eqs . ( 2.4 ) and ( 2.5 ) one finds @xmath45 where summation over repeated greek indices is implied .",
    "the condition ( 2.6 ) can be expressed as @xmath46 , so that @xmath47 with friction tensor @xmath48 hence we obtain the swimming velocity @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the inverse of the friction tensor . the @xmath18 friction matrix @xmath21 depends only on the instantaneous relative positions .",
    "therefore the friction tensor @xmath51 and the mobility tensor @xmath52 depend on the displacement vector @xmath53 , but not on the central coordinates @xmath54 .    by series expansion of the mobility tensor @xmath52 and the friction matrix @xmath21 in powers of the displacement vector @xmath53 we obtain a corresponding expansion of the swimming velocity @xmath55 with first order term @xmath56 with mobility tensor @xmath57 and friction matrix @xmath58 calculated for the configuration @xmath59 . by periodicity of @xmath42 the time average of the first order swimming velocity vanishes , @xmath60 .",
    "we introduce the friction vectors @xmath61 where we have used the symmetry of the friction matrix @xmath21 .",
    "the vectors are related to the friction tensor by @xmath62 from the taylor series expansion of eq .

    "the center of the assembly is given by @xmath87 with cartesian unit vectors @xmath88 .",

    "further optimization may be possible by a rotation of axes .",
    "in particular cases a natural choice of axes will suggest itself .    in the formulation of the mobility matrix in eq .",
    "( 2.2 ) the nature of the forces @xmath126 need not be specified . in an earlier calculation @xcite we considered microswimmers with internal harmonic interactions , driven by actuating forces . in matrix form",

    "we compare the orbit with the ellipse given by eq .",
    "the mean swimming velocity and mean power , calculated as time - averages over the last period for values of the amplitude factor in the range @xmath175 , are shown in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "the corresponding efficiency is shown in fig .",
    "the dashed curves in figures @xmath176 replace figs . 3 , 4 , and 5 of ref . 1 , which were calculated from inappropriate actuating forces .",
    "the efficiency is approximately twice as large as calculated in ref . 1 .",
    "it is true that in fig .",
    "3 the efficiency for given @xmath148 calculated by the kinematic method is always larger than that calculated by the dynamic method from the limit cycle with actuating forces .",
    "however , we must compare the mean swimming velocity for two different strokes of the same mean power . in fig .",
    "5 we plot the power as a function of @xmath148 in the range @xmath177 as calculated by the two different methods . the value @xmath178 of the mean power occurs at @xmath179 in the kinematic method , and at @xmath180 in the dynamic method .",
    "for these values the mean swimming velocity is found to be @xmath181 for the elliptical orbit of the kinematic method , and @xmath182 for the limit cycle of the dynamical method .",
    "thus in the present case the elliptical orbit is the most efficient of the two .",
    "this does not exclude that for the same power an orbit with yet higher speed can be found .    at @xmath183 and for @xmath154",

    "the authors used radius @xmath186 mm , and period @xmath187 s. for viscosity of water @xmath188 poise our calculation yields @xmath189 0.0081 mm and @xmath190 .",
    "the latter value is somewhat less than the one given in table 1 of ref . 3 , and the displacement agrees well with the value @xmath191 mm of alouges et al",
    "..    finally we consider the efficiency calculated from eqs .",
    "( 3.4 ) and ( 3.22 ) for displacement in relative space of the form eq .",

    "the values of @xmath194 and @xmath195 can be related to the stokes parameters of the elliptical orbit @xcite . in fig .",
    "6 we show the efficiency for amplitude factor @xmath174 and ratio @xmath196 as a function of @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "the maximum is not very pronounced .",
    "the swimming performance of an assembly of spheres as a function of the amplitude of a chosen stroke can be studied in a purely kinematic formulation . from eq .",
    "( 3.4 ) we find the instantaneous swimming velocity , and from eq .",
    "( 3.22 ) we find the instantaneous rate of dissipation or power . the mean swimming velocity and the mean power follow by averaging over a period .",
    "the ratio of these two quantities yields the efficiency of the stroke .",
    "alternatively one may use a dynamic approach @xcite,@xcite in which the swimmer is modeled as a set of spheres bound harmonically to equilibrium positions and with harmonic interactions .",
    "the spheres are subject to actuating forces which sum to zero .",
    "the corresponding swimming motion may be found as the limit cycle of the solution of the equations of stokesian dynamics .",
    "the mean swimming velocity and the mean power may be found numerically from the limit cycle .",
    "we have shown in sect .",
    "5 that for a collinear three - sphere swimmer the two methods lead to similar results over a wide range of amplitude , provided that for small amplitude the actuating forces correspond to the chosen kinematic stroke . we have chosen the latter to be the optimal one at small amplitude , as determined from the velocity matrix and the power matrix of the bilinear theory .    the kinematic method is the more straightforward one , since it does not require numerical solution of the equations of stokesian dynamics .",
    "the dynamic approach has the advantage that it provides a physical model of the swimmer .",
    "it will be of interest to explore the difference in efficiency for given stroke or given actuating forces as a function of amplitude factor for more sophisticated model swimmers , with actuating forces chosen to agree with the optimal stroke at small amplitude .    99    b. u. felderhof , eur .",
