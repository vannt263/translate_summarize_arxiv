    "polar - ring galaxies ( prgs ) are one of the more remarkable objects of the large family of non - barred ring galaxies .",
    "they are generally composed of an s0-like galaxy and a polar ring , which remain separate for billions of years ( whitmore et al .",
    "prgs are ideal laboratories to gain insight into galaxy formation processes because of the high inclination of their outer structures and the evidence of very recent gas infall . the mechanism by which these quasi - stable systems have formed is generally attributed to galaxy - galaxy interactions but most of the details have not been finalized ( bekki 1998 ; bournaud & combes 2003 ) .",
    "a straightforward observational approach to detect prgs is to search for distinctive features .",
    "the central early - type galaxy is mostly devoid of gas and is surrounded by a highly inclined ring of gas , dust and stars .",
    "moreover , the system needs to be in quasi - equilibrium , with the centres of the two components closely aligned . the first large survey aimed to identify prgs",
    "was performed by whitmore et al .",
    "their photographic atlas of prgs and related objects lists 157 objects , mainly selected based on their peculiar appearance .",
    "unfortunately , only a few kinematic follow - up studies of these objects were performed , confirming the nature of about a couple of dozens of these systems .",
    "polar rings span a wide range of size and luminosity , not necessarily comparable to that of their central hosts ( reshetnikov & sotnikova 1997 ) .",
    "extended , luminous polar structures are relatively simple to detect , while faint rings are more difficult to recognize by visual inspection of traditional images of nearby galaxies , or during a serendipitous search in large and shallow surveys such as the sdss ( see brosch et al .",
    "2010 ; finkelman , graur & brosch 2011 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the sdss holds an enormous potential for detecting many new prgs at various redshifts among the millions of targeted objects . however , no automated procedure for searching this database for galaxies with certain characteristics exists at the present . to help classify the millions of objects , the interactive project ` galaxy zoo ' invites the public to examine on - line images of galaxies and answer a standard set of questions about their features ( lintott et al .",
    "while there is no unique classification for prgs , any likely candidate can be posted to ` the possible polar ring thread ' or any other related official forum in the galaxy zoo ( http://www.galaxyzoo.org/ ) .",
    "galaxy zoo therefore provides an opportunity to significantly increase our knowledge of nearby prgs .",
    "moiseev et al .",
    "( 2011 ) selected from the dedicated web forums a ` reference ' galaxy sample which was used to formulate criteria for selecting new nearby candidate prgs from the galaxy zoo . after visually inspecting thousand of objects , moiseev et al .  compiled a final list of 275 candidate prgs and related objects ( the sloan - based polar ring catalogue , sprc ) , including 14 galaxies provided by us .",
    "the new candidates are typically fainter and are more distant than the previously known prgs .",
    "their study , therefore , holds a promise of building up a more complete picture of how these systems form .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section [ s : sample ] explains the sample selection , section [ s : obs_and_red ] gives a description of all the observations and data analysis , and section [ s : analysis ] details the properties of individual galaxies .",
    "we discuss the results in section [ s : discuss ] .",
    "the sample , included also in the sprc , was selected by us from a large compilation of suspected prg publicly available on ` the possible polar ring thread ' web forum .",
    "we carefully selected 16 promising prgs by visually examining their sdss images .",
    "these candidates were chosen following the confident identification of an extended polar structure ( about 10 - 20 arcsec wide ) .",
    "we also verified that the apparent polar ring in each sample galaxy is not produced by a projected background galaxy by using their sdss spectra .",
    "the sample galaxies are listed in table 1 with their coordinates , radial velocity and @xmath2-magnitude taken from the sdss database .    [ cols= \"",
    "> , < , < , < , > , < , < \" , ]",
    "mergers are expected to be less common in rich environments due to the high relative velocity of galaxies ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "therefore , studying the visible neighbourhood of prgs could provide further clues to the formation of prgs ( brocca et al .",
    "we searched for nearby companions with similar redshift and brightness and found that the number of galaxies surrounding our prgs varies from very few in low - density environments to a couple of dozens in the rich environments of clusters .",
    "several prgs ( 5 , 10 and 14 ) belong to dense galaxy groups and it is likely that a gravitational link between the galaxies is present . to characterize the environment we visually inspected the sdss images and spectra of the surrounding galaxies .",
    "prgs 5 , 8 and 14 are surrounded mostly by early - type galaxies .",
    "prgs 3 , 9 , 11 , 15 and 16 , which show signatures of recent or on - going star formation , are surrounded by blue star - forming galaxies , implying a gas - rich environment .",
    "to apply an extensive statistical analysis on the environment of prgs we search for possible group member galaxies among the candidates listed in the sprc .",
    "this is done by cross - identifying the ` best ' and ` good ' candidates with group members listed in tempel et al .",
    "the tempel et al .",
    "catalogue , including 78 858 groups , was constructed from sdss dr8 by applying a group - finding algorithm based on the friends - of - friends method .",
    "the catalogue is restricted to the sdss main area survey , including 576 493 galaxies , and provides information on @xmath365% of the sprc galaxies . to investigate their environments we obtain for each group ( or field galaxy ) its estimated total luminosity and number of observed members ( ` richness ' ) . for comparison",
    ", we apply the same analysis on the samples of ` normal ' etgs , b - etgs and d - etgs and present the results in fig .",
    "[ f : compare ] .    although previous studies argued that the environment of prgs is similar to that of normal galaxies ( brocca et al .",
    "1997 ) , our analysis reveals differences between the various types of etgs .",
    "in particular , we find that prgs preferentially inhabit low density environments compared to the other etg samples .",
    "this implies a role of environment which is consistent with mergers as triggers of prg formation .",
    "we note also that d - etgs are more frequent than prgs in high density environments .",
    "this can be explained by a natural selection effect ; in many prgs the luminous polar structure extends much farther than the main body and could be destroyed more easily by close neighbours .",
    "our study sets the stage for future more detailed work aiming to understand the formation history of prgs .",
    "in particular , we will attempt to confirm that the hosts and rings truly represent two distinct stellar populations by constraining their age and metallicty and determining their kinematics .",
    "the galaxies in sprc are typically at higher @xmath4 than those published and studied by whitmore et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and others , and could bridge the distance gap between nearby prgs and high-@xmath5 prg - candidates found in _ hst _ observations ( e.g. , reshetnikov 1997 ) . including the coadded stripe82 images in the galaxy zoo project makes it possible to add new promising candidates to the sprc .",
    "sdss j033412.96 + 011307.5 at @xmath6 , shown in fig .",
    "[ f : distant ] , is one such example .",
    "based on observations with the vatt : the alice p.  lennon telescope and the thomas j.  bannan astrophysics facility .",
    "this study makes use of data from the sdss ( http://www.sdss.org/collaboration/credits.html ) .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for constructive comments .",
    "we would like to thank jonathan stott s.j .  for assisting with the vatt observations , sugata kaviraj for supplying the sample of dusty early - type galaxies and benny trakhtenbrot for his useful comments .",
    "we would also like to thank the many dedicated volunteers of the galaxy zoo project and , in particular , the participants of ` the possible polar ring thread ' forum .",
