    "nanomedicine is an emerging field that offers great promise in the development of non - invasive strategies for the imaging , diagnosis and treatment of disease .",
    "the development of platform technologies that suit a wide range of potential applications is crucial due to the complexity of the _ in - vivo _ response coupled with time consuming and expensive toxicity studies@xcite .",
    "silicon and its oxide derivatives are one such material that has emerged for targeting and drug delivery that may suit a range of intravascular and gastrointestinal applications@xcite . to date , _ in - vivo _  imaging and tracking of silicon particles has been realized via confinement - enhanced optical activation@xcite or by the incorporation of imaging agents such as fluorescent markers@xcite , paramagnetic compounds for conventional magnetic resonance imaging ( mri)@xcite , or radionuclides for positron emission tomography ( pet)@xcite .",
    "magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) is an attractive technique for both _ in - vivo  studies and clinical diagnosis as it is non - invasive , yields high anatomical resolution , and requires no ionizing radiation .",
    "however , the small magnetic moment of atomic nuclei means that large numbers of nuclei are required for imaging under conventional conditions .",
    "one approach to increasing the mri signal is to increase polarization far beyond its equilibrium value  a technique known as hyperpolarization .",
    "for instance , hyperpolarized noble gases have shown great promise in structural imaging of the lungs@xcite , while hyperpolarized @xmath1c and @xmath2n metabolites have been used for studies of metabolism and ph in oncology@xcite .",
    "a key requirement for hyperpolarization is the transfer of angular momentum from a highly polarized source to the target nuclei .",
    "for example , the source of angular momentum in the noble gas experiments is an optically excited vapor of alkali metal@xcite . for liquid state metabolites ,",
    "the source is the spin of free radicals ( unpaired electrons ) combined with the metabolite of interest for low temperature dynamic nuclear polarization ( dnp)@xcite , or parahydrogen in combination with an organo - metallic catalyst@xcite . _",
    "mri using silicon is particularly attractive for several reasons .",
    "first , the nuclear magnetic moment of @xmath0si  is close to that of @xmath1c and @xmath2n , putting it within tuning range of commercial multinuclear mri systems .",
    "second , direct imaging of @xmath0si  is essentially background free , as the body contains only trace quantities of si naturally .",
    "third , because native si consists of a dilute ( 4.6% ) concentration of spin-1/2 @xmath0si  nuclei in a nuclear - spin - free lattice , the weak dipolar interaction between @xmath0si  nuclei , and their insensitivity to crystalline electric fields ( unique to spin 1/2 nuclei ) results in remarkably long relaxation times ( @xmath3 ) , up to several hours in high purity samples@xcite , coherence times ( @xmath4 ) of several seconds@xcite , and an insensitivity to lattice orientation or rotation .",
    "fourth , while there are few unpaired electrons within bulk of high purity crystalline si , surface defects comprising unpaired electrons are prevalent at the naturally occurring silicon / silica ( silicon dioxide ) interface ( fig .",
    "surface defects are ideal for dnp@xcite , and , because they are remote from most @xmath0si  nuclei , do not lead to rapid relaxation of nuclear hyperpolarization .    si  nuclear spins through dnp .",
    "( b ) sem image of the silicon particles used in this experiment .",
    "( c ) volume weighted particle size distribution obtained by sem image analysis showing an average particle size of @xmath5 ( black bars ) .",
    "the average crystallite size is @xmath6 350 nm ( grey bar ) , as determined by powder xrd analysis.*,width=2 ]",
    "in this study , we used commercially obtained high purity silicon particles with a mean diameter of 2  @xmath7 m ( fig .",
    "1b - c , see supplementary information s1.1 ) .",
    "each particle consists of a number of crystalline cores ( @xmath6  350  nm diameter , determined by powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) analysis , see supplementary information s1.2 and fig .",
    "s1 ) surrounded by amorphous silicon and a silica shell .",
    "particles were either used in their as - supplied condition or were surface functionalized with 3-aminopropytriethoxysilane ( aptes ) and polyethylene glycol ( peg ) for increased biocompatability@xcite and hydrostability ( see methods ) .",
    "the complex surface structure of the particles ( fig .",
    "1b ) results in a high surface - to - volume ratio ( 0.9  m@xmath8/g , determined by nitrogen adsorption - desorption isotherms , see supplementary information s1.3 ) , giving a large density ( @xmath910@xmath1 @xmath10 , determined by electron spin resonance , see supplementary information s1.4 ) of defect - bound electrons .",
    "at low temperatures and high magnetic fields , unpaired electrons at the particle surface are highly spin polarized . by applying microwave irradiation slightly below the electron spin resonance frequency , spin flip - flops",
    "are driven between nearby dipolar - coupled electrons , leading to a net transfer of spin polarization from the electrons to @xmath0si  nuclei near the surface . over time , @xmath0si  nuclei in the particle core become hyperpolarized via nuclear spin diffusion from the surface , a process similar to the conduction of heat .",
    "nuclei in the core region are protected from relaxation , the dominant pathway being slow nuclear spin diffusion back to the surface .",
    "provided that the magnitude of the external field exceeds the dipolar field of the @xmath0si  nuclei , the time scale for this process is independent of ambient magnetic field@xcite and temperature@xcite , depending only on hyperpolarization time ( @xmath11 ) , particle size and the purity of the particle@xcite .",
    "this allows the hyperpolarized particles to be transported through an environment of varying magnetic fields from the polarizer to the mri system over several minutes without a significant loss of polarization .",
    "this is in contrast to hyperpolarized materials in the liquid state such as @xmath1c  labelled metabolites , where molecular and bond rotations occurring at a frequency equal to the nuclear lamor frequency induce additional nuclear spin - lattice relaxation@xcite .",
    "we used a home - built dnp polarizer operating at a magnetic field of 2.9  t and temperature of 3.4  k located adjacent to a 4.7  t animal mri system ( see methods and supplementary information s2.1 and fig .",
    "a comparison of @xmath0si  spectra for dry particles and _ in - vivo  measurements in the mri system after a depolarization time @xmath12 = 30  min following hyperpolarization is shown in fig .",
    "both spectra show a line width ( full width at half maximum ) of @xmath6  400  hz , consistent with the dipolar line width for crystalline silicon .",
    "a slight additional broadening is seen in the dry sample , presumably corresponding to @xmath0si  nuclei close to the particle surface .",
    "we attribute the absence of this additional broadening in the _ in - vivo  case to nearby @xmath13h  nuclear spins in the _ in - vivo   environment that cause surface @xmath0si  nuclei to relax on times scales of roughly @xmath3  of the bordering @xmath13h  nuclei .",
    "figure  2b shows the decay of @xmath0si  polarization for dry and _ in - vivo  particles using a variable flip angle sequence following hyperpolarization for a time @xmath11 = 18 h ( see methods ) . despite the difference in absolute @xmath0si  signal between the two measurements ,",
    "the characteristic depolarization time constant @xmath14 is approximately the same for the dry ( @xmath15 min ) and _ in - vivo  cases ( @xmath16 min ) .",
    "the difference in absolute signal is attributed to sample loss in the dilution and injection procedures , a reduced concentration of silicon particles within the active region of the coil , as well as a contribution from enhanced surface relaxation . by comparing the signal strength to that of a co - located @xmath0si  phantom ( see methods )",
    "we estimate a @xmath0si  nuclear polarization of roughly 1% in the imager . _ _ _ _ _    si  nuclear spin dynamics in silicon particles .",

    "the difference in absolute signal is mainly due to reduced concentration within the active region of the coil .",
    "( c ) characteristic @xmath0si  depolarization time constants ( @xmath14 ) in dry particle phantoms recorded in the imager for polarization times of 4 , 6 , 12 , and 18 hours .",
    "( d ) time evolution of the @xmath0si  nuclear polarization under dnp conditions for particles with and without surface functionalization with peg .",
    "the signal is normalized by sample weight.__*,width=3 ]    the observed depolarization time constants are significantly longer than the ensemble - averaged characteristic spin - lattice relaxation time constant , @xmath3  @xmath18 min , of the sample measured by a saturation recovery method at 2.9  t and 300  k ( see supplementary information s2.2 and fig .",
    "isolated electronic defects within the particle core are ineffective for dnp and act only as local relaxation sites . once the temperature is raised and magnetic fields is lowered for transfer to the imager , these internal defects and the surface defects used for dnp all act as strong points of relaxation on local @xmath0si  nuclei .",
    "depolarization measurements following dnp are therefore dominated by contributions from nuclei far from local relaxation points , giving a longer characteristic time constants for depolarization from the hyperpolarized state than for polarization under boltzmann conditions .",
    "the depolarization time constants are lengthened with increasing hyperpolarization time ( @xmath11 ) ( fig .",
    "2c ) , and could be further improved by increasing the polarization efficiency or improving the internal crystal structure of the particles ( see supplementary information s2.3 and fig .",
    "no significant difference is observed in the @xmath0si  hyperpolarization rate for short time periods ( fig .",
    "2d ) , where the hyperpolarization may be affected by nearby @xmath13h  nuclei within the functionalizing moieties .",
    "this is not unexpected , as the aptes linker contains few spinful nuclei and provides a buffer between the particle surface and the @xmath13h  rich peg .",
    "to establish the practical time window for obtaining hyperpolarized mri images , we imaged a millimeter - scale phantom constructed from segments of dry silicon particles separated by teflon spacers ( fig .",
    "images were recorded at delay times @xmath12 = 0 , 30 , 60 , and 90 min after placing the phantom in the mri imager , using separate hyperpolarizations for each time interval .",
    "the phantom image is clearly visible at @xmath12 = 0 , 30 and 60 min for a single average with a signal to noise ratio ( snr ) greater than 12 .",
    "after 90 min , only the top three segments are visible ( snr > 3 ) , probably due to a variation in polarization across the sample resulting from an uneven microwave field distribution in the polarizer .",

    "the images are of 250  @xmath7l cylindrical phantoms containing between 66 and 5  mg / ml of silicon particles dispersed in ethanol .",
    "a sensitivity limit is set by the silicon particle concentration in the outer two columns of the least concentrated sample . assuming a uniform distribution of particles within the phantom and taking into account the cylindrical projection onto the plane , this corresponds to a visible single pixel concentration of @xmath610  @xmath7 g of hyperpolarized silicon particles per pixel . for a particle diameter of 2  @xmath7 m",
    ", we estimate an absolute sensitivity of @xmath19 individual particles / pixel , or a particle molar sensitivity of @xmath20 mol / l at a depth of 1 cm from the face of the @xmath64  cm imaging coil .",
    "this corresponds to an absolute @xmath0si  sensitivity of @xmath21 mol / l , which is comparable in sensitivity with other reported paramagnetic mri nanoparticle agents@xcite and significantly better than @xmath22 labelled cells@xcite .",
    "we have carried out a number of _ in - vivo  imaging studies to demonstrate the versatility of hyperpolarized @xmath0si  mri .",

    "the peg chain used to functionalize the particles was chosen as it is known to enhance the circulation of similarly sized particles@xcite .",
    "the high concentration of particles carried in the vena cava , and the proximity of the vena cava to the imaging coil results in this signal dominating over signals from other areas in the animal .",
    "after two minutes , some particle accumulation is observed in the organs of the mononuclear phagocyte system ( mps ) , consistent with accumulation patterns of similar sized materials imaged optically@xcite .    as a preliminary demonstration of perfusion imaging with hyperpolarized silicon mri",
    ", we administered hyperpolarized silicon particles into the prostate tumor of a transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate ( tramp ) mouse ( fig .",

    "the particles used in this study are too large to enter the cellular structure of the tumor , however they accurately map the blood vessel microstructure inside the tumor , as well as the direction of blood flow within the tumor . initially the @xmath0si  mri shows accumulation at the lower right quadrant of the tumor while later images show a higher concentration in the upper right quadrant .",
    "there was little @xmath0si  signal observed on the left side of the tumor at any imaging time , suggesting an area of necrosis .",
    "this observation was confirmed visually post - mortem",
    ".    a key advantage of hyperpolarized @xmath0si  mri is biocompatability .",
    "silica is frequently used as a biocompatible coating for other nanoscale probes@xcite , and several studies have reported negligible toxicity of silicon particles@xcite . in these investigations , the clearance mechanism has been attributed to degradation of silicon and silica into soluble silicic acid followed by excretion within a few days . our preliminary study of in - vivo toxicity of these particles up to",
    "the imaging concentrations show no decrease in animal viability over a two week period for particles administered via gi , ip or iv routes .",
    "comparison of mps organ tissue sections between those harvested three hours after iv administration and two weeks ( fig .",
    "s9 ) show that these silicon particles appear to be efficiently cleared within the two week period .",
    "several orders of magnitude improvement in the concentration threshold and imaging time - frame presented here are possible .",
    "eliminating isolated defects in the internal crystal structure and chemically enhancing the surface defect density , would result in more efficient hyperpolarization and significantly longer depolarization time constants .",
    "the hyperpolarization mechanism via surface defects is applicable to silicon particles of any size , with the time window available for imaging ultimately set by the hyperpolarization time and the distance the nuclear spin hyperpolarization has to diffuse to relax .",
    "previous studies indicate that the depolarization times observed here ( @xmath6 40 min ) do not decrease significantly as particle size is reduced by an order of magnitude below those used in this study@xcite , and we have recently engineered 10  nm particles with @xmath3  times greater than 10 minutes@xcite .",
    "isotopic enrichment , though not yet commercially available , reduces the hyperpolarization and depolarization time constants by a theoretical factor of @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the isotopic fraction , but brings about a linear increase in signal .",
    "although , we have studied enriched @xmath0si  samples ( 92% @xmath0si ) in other studies @xcite and observe that the decreases in hyperpolarization and depolarization times qualitatively agree with theory .    because the time scale for depolarization does not depend on surface functionalization , targeting strategies developed for silica coated nanovectors",
    "can be applied to particles optimized for hyperpolarized @xmath0si  mri .",
    "surface doping may allow for extremely large nuclear polarizations to be generated on fast timescales@xcite through combined optical - microwave techniques .",
    "additionally , as the _ in - vivo  @xmath14  times are at least two order of magnitude longer than those of hyperpolarized @xmath1c@xcite and @xmath25xe@xcite , it may be possible to use the nuclear hyperpolarization within the particles to store polarization ( as a battery ) , then transfer polarization to read - out nuclei with higher gyromagnetic ratio via established cross - polarization techniques .",
    "_    several other approaches to background - free imaging are currently under development .",
    "most notable is @xmath22 , which has been widely investigated as a contrast agent both in drugs and in perfluorocarbon ( pfc ) nanoparticles@xcite .",
    "its 100% natural abundance and high gyromagnetic ratio together with a lack of _ in - vivo  background signal allows it to be imaged without hyperpolarization .",
    "however _ in - vivo  studies using @xmath22 typically require large numbers of averages@xcite , compared to the singles - shot images shown here .",
    "such long averaging times do not allow for real - time tracking of particles _ in - vivo , and are suited best to accumulation studies over long time periods where the particle location has reached a steady state .",
    "additionally , unlike boltzmann polarized materials such as @xmath22 , where the signal is dependent on strength of the magnetic field used for imaging , the hyperpolarized @xmath0si  nuclei can be easily imaged with high sensitivity at low magnetic fields using affordable permanent magnet or inductive coil mri systems . _",
    "_ _    a key concern towards clinical applications of hyperpolarized @xmath0si  imaging may be the specific absorption rate ( sar ) issues associated with the use of fast spin - echo imaging techniques used in this work .",
    "we note that although spin - echo imaging gives a significant increase in signal , we have also employed gradient - echo imaging techniques for @xmath0si  mri@xcite . as the power deposited scales quadratically with the lamor frequency of the nucleus being imaged",
    ", the low gyromagnetic ratio of silicon together with the possibility of low - field imaging alleviates many of these concerns . additionally , research into fast mri techniques such as restricted k - space acquisition and compressed sensing@xcite , as well as hardware developments that minimize electric fields generated in imaging coils",
    "are extremely applicable to @xmath0si  mri .    in summary",
    ", we have demonstrated _ in - vivo  imaging of hyperpolarized silicon particles by mri , and investigated a range of potential applications . by choosing particles with",
    "a crystalline si core protected a surface oxide , the polarization generated in the particles is unaffected by the _ in - vivo  environment or particle tumbling .",
    "magnetic resonance offers not only the possibility of structural imaging , but also also functional imaging of flow , particle binding , or the local environment through surface functionalization .",
    "the lack of _ in - vivo  @xmath0si  background signal has the potential for quantification of the @xmath0si  magnetic resonance label , opening up the possibility to track the particle biodistribution systematically , analogous to the use of nuclear tracers .",

    "we have used a fast - spin echo ( fse ) imaging technique to take advantage of this effect , where a single pulse @xmath78 excites all the spins in a sample , and then a 2d image is acquired by repeated spin echos together with the application of read gradients and stepping the phase gradient ( fig .",
    ". in our implementation only one traverse through k - space is made for each excitation pulse , however , as this long - tail lasts for several hundred milliseconds without decay , k - space averaging could be implemented by repeated cycling of the phase gradient without additional excitation pulses .",
    "a concern for clinical applications of this technology is the specific absorption rate ( sar ) issues associated with the use of fast spin - echo pulse sequences .",

    "for example , dong _ et al .  have demonstrated narrowing of nmr linewidth of @xmath0si  by a factor of about 70 000 using quadratic echos@xcite , and a similar line - narrowing technique has recently been applied in high - resolution ex - vivo mri of the @xmath82 nuclei in bone and brain tissue@xcite .",
    "fast gradient - echo ( fge ) techniques eliminate this issue , however this compromises the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) compared to fse imaging by a factor proportional to the number of lines of k - space addressed and the number of averages .",
    "we have however , successfully imaged @xmath0si  nuclei in silicon particles with much lower values of hyperpolarization using these methods@xcite .",
    "one distinct advantage of mri with a pre - hyperpolarized material such as silicon is that the signal strength is not dependent on the magnetic field , and so imaging could be successfully carried out at much lower magnetic fields where the power deposited by each pulse ( which scales quadratically with the nuclear lamor frequency ) is much less . as the @xmath0si  images are overlaid on high - resolution @xmath13h  anatomical scans , the resolution and snr of the @xmath0si  images can be much lower .",
    "this means that less echos have to be applied for a fse sequence , and less silicon particles must accumulate to provide sufficient signal .    unlike regular mri imaging ,",
    "our nuclear polarization is high enough so that our in - vivo @xmath0si  images are acquired without averaging , which minimizes the number of echos that have to be applied to a subject within the specified time frame .",
