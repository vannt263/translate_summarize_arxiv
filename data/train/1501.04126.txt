    "skyrmions were predicted to occur in certain magnetic systems @xcite and were subsequently experimentally identified in the chiral magnet mnsi @xcite . since this initial discovery",
    "there has been tremendous growth in the field as an increasing number of materials have been found that can support a skyrmion phase @xcite .",
    "there are also numerous proposals on how to stabilize skyrmion states by utilizing different materials properties or bilayers @xcite .",
    "direct imaging of skyrmions with lorentz microscopy @xcite and other techniques @xcite show that the skyrmions form a triangular lattice and have particle - like properties similar to vortices in type - ii superconductors @xcite . as an external magnetic field",
    "is increased , skyrmions emerge from a spiral state and their density initially increases and then decreases with field until the sample enters a uniform ferromagnetic state @xcite . in bulk samples ,",
    "skyrmions form three - dimensional ( 3d ) line objects and occur in a limited range of fields and temperatures @xcite , while for thin samples the skyrmions exhibit two - dimensional ( 2d ) properties and are stable over a much larger range of fields and temperatures extending close to room temperature @xcite .",
    "skyrmions can be set into motion through the application of an external current @xcite , and it has been shown that there is a critical current above which the skyrmions depin into a sliding state @xcite .",
    "skyrmion motion can be directly observed with lorentz microscopy @xcite or deduced from changes in the transport properties , permitting the construction of effective skyrmion velocity versus applied force curves that show that the skyrmion velocity increases with increasing current @xcite .",
    "other methods to move skyrmions include the use of temperature gradients @xcite , electric fields @xcite , and coupling to a magnetic tip @xcite .    from an applications standpoint",
    ", skyrmions are attracting attention due to their potential use in racetrack memory devices where they would play a role similar to that of magnetic domain walls @xcite .",
    "skyrmions have several advantages over domain walls due to their size and the fact that the current needed to depin a skyrmion can be orders of magnitude smaller than that needed to move domain walls @xcite .",
    "it has been experimentally demonstrated that individual skyrmions can be created or annihilated with a magnetic tip , indicating that it is feasible to read and write skyrmions @xcite .",
    "developing applications of skyrmions will require an understanding of how skyrmions interact with and move along tailored landscapes , so examining skyrmion dynamics on periodic substrates is an important step in this direction .",
    "skyrmions have many similarities to vortices in type - ii superconductors , such as the effective skyrmion - skyrmion interaction , which is repulsive and favors triangular ordering , and the fact that both skyrmions and vortices can be driven by an external current . in the presence of quenched disorder ,",
    "skyrmions exhibit pinning - depinning transitions @xcite , as observed in experiments @xcite and simulations @xcite , and these are similar to the depinning transitions observed for vortices in type - ii superconductors @xcite .",
    "there are important differences between the two systems , particularly the dominant role that non - dissipative effects can take in skyrmion motion . for superconducting vortices , non - dissipative effects such as a magnus force",
    "are typically small , permitting the system to be effectively described as obeying overdamped dynamics @xcite . in a skyrmion system , by contrast , the magnus term can strongly affect how the skyrmions interact with pinning sites and how they move under an external drive @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations using continuum and particle - based models for skyrmions interacting with pinning have shown that the magnus term reduces the effective pinning in the system by creating a velocity component that is perpendicular to the force induced by a pinning site @xcite . as a result",
    ", skyrmions have a tendency to swing around the edge of a pinning site and escape , while for overdamped systems a particle moves toward the center of a pinning site and is much more likely to be pinned .    relatively little",
    "is known about how particles with a strong magnus term move over a periodic substrate , and skyrmions are an ideal system to study such effects . in certain limits ,",
    "a skyrmion can be effectively modeled as a point - like particle utilizing an equation of motion @xcite derived from thiele s equation @xcite .",
    "comparison between continuum - based models and particle - based models of skyrmions moving in the presence of pinning have shown good agreement @xcite . in this work",
    "we examine the dynamics of a skyrmion moving over a square periodic substrate using a particle - based description given in section ii .",
    "we specifically examine the effect of changing the importance of the magnus term relative to that of the damping term . despite the apparent simplicity of this system ,",
    "we show in section iii that the magnus term can induce a remarkably rich variety of dynamical behaviors that are absent in the overdamped limit .",
    "we find that the hall angle for the skyrmion motion is dependent on the external drive amplitude and approaches the substrate - free limit only at higher drives .",
    "since the skyrmion is moving over a periodic substrate , as the hall angle changes the motion becomes locked to specific symmetry directions of the substrate , producing a series of steps in the transport curves corresponding to integer and rational fractional ratios of the skyrmion velocity in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the drive direction . at the transitions into the different directional locking phases",
    ", the skyrmion velocity exhibits a pronounced cusp accompanied by negative differential mobility in which the skyrmion velocity _ decreases _ with increasing external driving force .",
    "we map the extent of the locking phase as a function of the external drive and the ratio of the magnus and dissipative terms , and find a rich structure of integer and fractional locking effects .",
    "we also describe a speedup effect for skyrmions interacting with a substrate where the skyrmion velocity can be higher than the external drive .",
    "this effect is most prominent just above depinning and is caused by the magnus term ; it is absent in the overdamped case . in section",
    "iv we consider a skyrmion scattering from a single pinning site for varied impact parameters to show how the hall angle is reduced by the pinning due to a side - step phenomenon where the skyrmion trajectory is shifted by the magnus term as the skyrmion moves through the pinning site . for increasing drive amplitude ,",
    "the skyrmion trajectories become less curved and the size of the side step is reduced , so that the hall angle approaches the clean limit for higher drives .",
    "our results for the speedup effect and side steps are in agreement with recent theoretical and computational studies by m \" uller and rosch , who considered a single skyrmion interacting with a defect site @xcite . in that work ,",
    "the pinning potential is of a different form than the pinning sites we consider ; however , the consistency of the two studies indicates that the hall angle dependence on external drive and the speedup phenomenon are generic features of skyrmions interacting with pinning .",
    "there are other examples of particles moving over ordered substrates , such as vortices in type - ii superconductors with periodic pinning arrays @xcite or colloids placed on optically created periodic substrates @xcite . in these systems",
    "the dynamics is overdamped ; however , there can be directional locking effects in which the particles preferentially move along symmetry directions of the underlying substrate as the direction of drive is rotated with respect to the substrate lattice @xcite .",
    "such directional locking effects can be exploited to perform particle separation in colloidal systems by setting up a system in which one particle species locks to the substrate while the second species does not , causing the two species to move at an angle with each other @xcite .",
    "the direction of motion of the locked particles undergoes a series of steps as a function of the effective angle of drive with respect to the substrate .",
    "the steps are centered at integer and rational ratios of the angle of drive and form a devil s staircase structure @xcite . in the skyrmion system , we observe directional locking effects when the direction of external drive is _ fixed _ with respect to the substrate and the drive amplitude is varied . the directional locking and transitions into the locking states in the skyrmion system exhibit a number of features that have not been observed in overdamped systems , such as an overshoot effect in the locking direction and negative differential mobility at the locking transition .",
    "the steps in the transport response are also distinct from the shapiro steps found in systems that can be effectively described as a particle moving over a periodic substrate under superimposed ac and dc drives @xcite . in the system we consider in this work ,",
    "there is no imposed ac drive .",
    "we consider a skyrmion moving over a 2d square periodic substrate and utilize a particle - based description of the skyrmion from a recently developed equation of motion for skyrmions @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the skyrmion is obtained by integrating the equation of motion : @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the skyrmion velocity , and @xmath7 is a damping term representing spin precession and dissipation of electrons localized in the skyrmion .    the substrate force @xmath8 is applied by placing @xmath9 skyrmions in a square lattice with lattice constant @xmath10 and fixing them in place .",
    "these skyrmions interact repulsively with the mobile skyrmion .",
    "such a substrate could be created experimentally by placing an array of magnetic dots on the sample to create a background of effectively immobile skyrmions .",
    "alternatively , in recent continuum - based simulations it was shown that a defect site formed by removing a single spin creates a potential with a long range repulsion and a short range attraction @xcite .",
    "our system can then be viewed as containing a periodic array of such pinning sites in the limit where the moving skyrmion does not experience the shorter range attraction of the pins .",
    "we also consider a model in which the substrate potential is represented by a 2d sinusoidal array and find behavior very similar to that of a skyrmion moving through a pinned skyrmion lattice , indicating that our results are robust and capture the general features of skyrmions moving over periodic substrates .",
    "the force from the pinned skyrmions has the form @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the distance between the driven skyrmion @xmath13 and an immobile skyrmion @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath15 is the modified bessel function , which falls off exponentially for large @xmath12 , and @xmath16 is a screening length which we take to be @xmath17 in dimensionless units . the sample size is @xmath18 with @xmath19 , and the lattice constant of the substrate is @xmath20 . in the second system we model the substrate with the 2d periodic form @xmath21 $ ] , where @xmath20 is the substrate lattice constant and @xmath22 is the amplitude of the substrate force . in both systems we employ periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the magnus term @xmath23 produces a force that is perpendicular to the skyrmion velocity , where @xmath24 is the magnitude of the magnus term .",
    "the driving force is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the direction of the applied drive .",
    "such a force could arise due to the application of an external current to the skyrmion @xcite . in most of this work , we take @xmath27 .",
    "we measure the skyrmion velocity parallel , @xmath1 , and perpendicular , @xmath0 , to the drive . in the absence of a substrate or in the overdamped limit @xmath28 , the skyrmion moves in the direction of the drive , while for a finite @xmath29 the skyrmion moves at an angle @xmath30 with respect to the drive , where @xmath31 . increasing @xmath29 produces a larger angle @xmath30 for the skyrmion motion with respect to the external drive . to quantify the direction of motion we measure @xmath32 so that the hall angle @xmath30 is given by @xmath33 .",
    "we increase the external drive in small increments of @xmath34 to @xmath35 and wait several thousand simulation time steps before measuring the average velocity in order to ensure that the skyrmion velocity is in a steady state .",
    "we find that for smaller increments @xmath36 our results do not change . throughout this work",

    "we find that the hall angle generally increases with increasing external drive , but that there can be an overshoot effect in which the hall angle is larger than expected for the substrate - free or clean limit . in this case , as the drive increases the hall angle jumps back to a lower value closer to the clean limit value . at the transitions between different directional looking steps , the skyrmion velocity shows",
    "a striking series of cusps or dips where the skyrmion slows down for increasing @xmath42 , producing a negative differential mobility at the transitions . as @xmath29 increases , the number of transitions between different looking steps increases , as we map out in a series of phase diagrams .",
    "the directional locking effects exhibited by the skyrmions are very distinct from the directional locking effects previously observed for overdamped particles such as vortices and colloids interacting with periodic substrates . in the overdamped system , the angle of the external drive",
    "must be changed with respect to the symmetry direction of the substrate in order to induce locking steps , whereas for the skyrmion system the driving direction remains fixed ; only the magnitude of the driving force is changed . additionally , the overdamped systems exhibit neither the negative mobility phenomenon at the transitions between steps nor the overshoot effect .",
    "we find that the skyrmion motion can exhibit a speedup or acceleration effect where the interaction of the skyrmion with a pinning site can accelerate the skyrmion such that the skyrmion velocity is higher than the value that would be induced by the external drive alone .",
    "this effect is generally enhanced at the lower drives and suppressed near the directional locking transitions .",
    "it contrasts strongly with the behavior of overdamped systems , where interactions with pinning or a substrate always decrease the velocity of an overdamped particle .",
    "we find that all of these features are robust for different forms of the periodic substrate .",
    "to better understand how the pinning can induce a hall angle dependence on the magnitude of the drive , we consider a skyrmion scattering from a single pinning site . in the overdamped limit with @xmath41 ,",
    "the skyrmion becomes trapped by the pin whenever the external drive is less than the magnitude of the maximum pinning force that can be exerted by the pinning site . for external drives larger than this value",
    ", the skyrmion escapes from the pin and its trajectory is shifted perpendicular to the direction of skyrmion motion .",
    "the shift is symmetric for positive and negative impact parameters , so there is no net shift of the trajectory when all impact parameters are integrated .",
    "in contrast , at a finite @xmath29 , the magnitude of the trajectory shift depends asymmetrically on the impact parameter , producing a nonzero net shift of the skyrmion as it moves through the pinning site when all impact parameters are integrated .",
    "this shift is similar to the side jump phenomenon found in electron scattering . as the external drive",
    "is increased , the net shift decreases and the skyrmion motion approaches the pin - free trajectory track .",
    "the trajectory shift is responsible for the modified hall angle experienced by the skyrmion at low drives , and the gradual decrease in shift with increasing drive causes the hall angle to gradually approach the clean limit value . for the case of a periodic substrate ,",
    "the additional symmetry of the substrate prevents the angle of the skyrmion motion from changing continuously ; instead , the motion changes in a series of steps with increasing drive as it approaches the clean limit value .",
    "we also find that for finite @xmath29 , depending on the impact parameter the skyrmion may or may not become pinned regardless of whether the maximum pinning force is smaller than the driving force , and that for increasing @xmath29 , the range of impact parameters over which the particle is not pinned even when the driving force is smaller than the maximum pinning force increases .",
    "this is one of the reasons that pinning of skyrmions is much weaker than pinning in overdamped systems such as superconducting vortices .",

    "<S> we examine the dynamics of a skyrmion moving over a two - dimensional periodic substrate utilizing simulations of a particle - based skyrmion model . </S>",

    "<S> , there is a depinning transition into a sliding state in which the skyrmion moves in the same direction as the external drive . when there is a finite magnus component in the equation of motion , a skyrmion in the absence of a substrate moves at an angle with respect to the direction of the external driving force . </S>",
    "<S> when a periodic substrate is added , the direction of motion or hall angle of the skyrmion is dependent on the amplitude of the external drive , only approaching the substrate - free limit for higher drives . due to the underlying symmetry of the substrate </S>",
    "<S> the direction of skyrmion motion does not change continuously as a function of drive , but rather forms a series of discrete steps corresponding to integer or rational ratios of the velocity components perpendicular ( @xmath0 ) and parallel ( @xmath1 ) to the external drive direction : @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are integers . </S>",
    "<S> the skyrmion passes through a series of directional locking phases in which the motion is locked to certain symmetry directions of the substrate for fixed intervals of the drive amplitude . within a given directionally locked phase , </S>",
    "<S> the hall angle remains constant and the skyrmion moves in an orderly fashion through the sample . </S>",
    "<S> signatures of the transitions into and out of these locked phases take the form of pronounced cusps in the skyrmion velocity versus force curves , as well as regions of negative differential mobility in which the net skyrmion velocity decreases with increasing external driving force . </S>",
    "<S> the number of steps in the transport curve increases when the relative strength of the magnus term is increased . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe an overshoot phenomena in the directional locking , where the skyrmion motion can lock to a hall angle greater than the clean limit value and then jump back to the lower value at higher drives . </S>",
    "<S> the skyrmion - substrate interactions can also produce a skyrmion acceleration effect in which , due to the non - dissipative dynamics , the skyrmion velocity exceeds the value expected to be produced by the external drive . </S>",
    "<S> we find that these effects are robust for different types of periodic substrates . </S>",
    "<S> using a simple model for a skyrmion interacting with a single pinning site , we can capture the behavior of the change in the hall angle with increasing external drive . </S>",
    "<S> when the skyrmion moves through the pinning site , its trajectory exhibits a side step phenomenon since the magnus term induces a curvature in the skyrmion orbit . as the drive increases </S>",
    "<S> , this curvature is reduced and the side step effect is also reduced . increasing the strength of the magnus term reduces the range of impact parameters over which the skyrmion can be captured by a pinning site , which is one of the reasons that strong magnus force effects reduce the pinning in skyrmion systems . </S>"
