    "it is known that a @xmath0-complex in the @xmath2-space can not have torsion in the first and second homology groups .",
    "thus , this embeddability property restricts the first homology group ( hence also the fundamental group ) .",
    "the embeddability into @xmath3 also makes the computation of the homology groups and betti numbers more efficient using alexander duality @xcite .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that , from a computational point of view , no restriction applies to the first @xmath4-homology of @xmath0-complexes embedded in @xmath5 .",
    "this was done by reducing matrix rank computation to computing betti numbers of @xmath0-complexes in @xmath5 .",
    "for such a reduction in complexities of algorithms , one needs embedded complexes with given homology groups that moreover can be constructed efficiently , in almost linear time , from the given input .",
    "the input in the case of @xcite was a 0 - 1 matrix @xmath6 , which was considered as a system of equations @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a vector of variables .",
    "then an embedded simplicial complex was constructed in linear time such that its second @xmath4-homology group is isomorphic with the null - space of @xmath6 .",
    "now a generalization of this reduction of rank computation to homology computation of complexes in @xmath5 is to consider @xmath9 coefficients and integer matrices , or in a more general setting , one can study what embeddability implies regarding the fundamental group .",
    "such a generalization was the purpose of this work .",
    "we are given a finite presentation @xmath10 of a group , and , our goal is to construct a complex in @xmath5 whose fundamental group is isomorphic with the given group . in order to be useful for the reduction of algorithmic problems , the embedding needs to be constructive .",
    "moreover , we need the whole construction take an almost linear time .",
    "this is because we want to argue that , in terms of computational complexity , for problems about the fundamental group or the first homology group , we gain nothing when the @xmath0-complex is given as realized in @xmath5 , compared to an abstract @xmath0-complex .",
    "we broadly define a _ model simplicial complex _ to be one that is constructed in a standard way ( i.e. , by a fix algorithm ) from a presentation of a group , and whose fundamental group is isomorphic with the presented group .",
    "this is in contrast to the common definition , for instance in @xcite , and more suited to our purposes . in the literature ,",
    "there exist proofs of the fact that model @xmath0-complexes embed in @xmath5 .",
    "the first mention of this result is in a statement by curtis @xcite .",
    "later stallings generalized this fact and showed that any homotopy type of @xmath11-complexes is embeddable in @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a simple proof of stalling s theorem .",
    "there are also results in the literature on embeddings of @xmath0-complexes with certain properties for the complementary space . in @xcite ,",
    "together with giving another proof of embeddability of model complexes , it is shown that acyclic @xmath0-complexes can be embedded with contractible complement , see also references in it . for a survey on possible thickenings of @xmath0-complexes in various dimensions",
    "see @xcite .",
    "in this article , we give an explicit linear embedding of _ a _ model complex which is small , as is needed in the reduction arguments and to be made precise below , see theorem [ theorem : bit ] .",
    "the embedding results are formalized and proved in theorems [ theorem : main ] and [ theorem : bit ] .",
    "our proof was derived independently from the existing literature .",
    "we note that although our argument has turned out to be similar in nature to @xcite , the approach we use needs a modification of the given presentation ( see the beginning of section [ section : proofs ] ) , and , we build the complex for the modified presentation .",
    "the embedding of the model complex is then linear .",
    "in addition , we mention some interesting corollaries of the main theorem , which are partly well - known , as examples of possible applications of such simple embeddability arguments , namely , corollary [ cor : manifold ] and theorem [ theorem : htype ] .",
    "we also generalize a simple theorem on undecidability of a relative embedding problem for dimensions @xmath13 , proved in @xcite for @xmath14 .",
    "it is not difficult to compute the complexity of embedding procedures presented in some of the existing literature , and they are at best linear in the unary size of the presentation ( as defined in section [ section : theorems ] ) , and , not `` small '' in our sense . for us ,",
    "small _ means that the complex has number of simplices proportional to the bit - complexity of the presentation , i.e. , the number of bits required to encode the presentation .",
    "certain other interests also exist in having small model complexes in euclidean @xmath1-space , see for instance @xcite .",
    "one implication of the embeddability of model complexes in @xmath5 is that an algorithm for deciding whether a given @xmath0-complex ( pl ) embeds in @xmath5 does not decide any property of the fundamental group .",

    "then at least one of @xmath197 makes an angle with the normal vector of @xmath105 ( pointing towards the half - space containing the @xmath199 ) which is greater than @xmath200 , where @xmath201 denotes length .",
    "let @xmath171 be the angle that @xmath202 makes with the normal and @xmath172 the same for @xmath203 .",
    "let @xmath204 be the endpoints of the segments in @xmath105 respectively .",
    "we can assume that the intersection point is the other endpoint of the two segments .",
    "let @xmath205 be a segment of length equal to @xmath206 and perpendicular to @xmath105 at @xmath207 .",
    "similarly , let @xmath208 be the segment of the length @xmath209 and perpendicular to @xmath105 at @xmath210 .",
    "let @xmath211 , @xmath212 be the other endpoints of @xmath205 , @xmath208 respectively . consider the circle with center @xmath207 passing through @xmath198 and @xmath211 and let @xmath213 be the short arc between @xmath211 and @xmath198 on this circle .",
    "define @xmath214 symmetrically .",
    "then we have @xmath215 it follows that @xmath216 , which implies @xmath217 or @xmath218 .",
    "to finish the proof of the theorem , it is enough to observe that the circle in @xmath151 which is the upper boundary of @xmath44 can be coned from a vertex in the other side of @xmath113 and inside @xmath150 .",
    "this cone will be an embedded disk in @xmath150 , and serves to kill the homotopy class of @xmath103 .",
    "@xmath219    we remark that the condition @xmath220 is independent of the given presentation .",
    "hence the real constraint on @xmath221 which makes them arbitrarily small when the number of relations is large , comes from the existence of disjoint intervals @xmath222 .",
    "we assume the given cw complex is connected . since for any @xmath0-dimensional cw complex there exists a simplicial complex homotopy equivalent to it , it is sufficient to show that for any given simplicial @xmath0-complex @xmath223 there exists a homotopy equivalent complex @xmath48 realized in @xmath5 .",
    "we build @xmath48 out of @xmath223 by contracting a spanning tree of the @xmath89-skeleton .",
    "then @xmath48 is a cw complex whose cells are simplices and attaching maps are simplicial .",
    "since the @xmath89-skeleton of @xmath48 is a wedge of circles it can be embedded in a @xmath0-plane @xmath91 .",
    "let @xmath224 be the @xmath89-cells of @xmath48 and @xmath225 be attaching maps of @xmath0-cells of @xmath48 .",
    "observe that since the @xmath0-cells come from triangles of @xmath48 each attaching map defines an element of the homotopy class of the @xmath89-skeleton represented by at most three distinct generators ( or inverse of a generator ) .",
    "the procedure used in the proof of the main theorem applied to the presentation @xmath226 , \\",
    "\\ldots , [ \\phi_m ] \\rangle $ ] builds a simplicial @xmath0-complex in @xmath5 which is homotopy equivalent to @xmath48 .",
    "this last claim follows since the complex in @xmath5 and @xmath48 have the same @xmath89-skeleton and homotopic attaching maps for @xmath0-cells , see for instance theorem 1.6 in @xcite .",
    "the proof for @xmath227 is given in @xcite .",
    "here we explain and expand that proof and show it applies to the case @xmath228 .",
    "we start by constructing the complex @xmath48 for a presentation @xmath26 of a group whose word problem is undecidable .",
    "this implies that there is a sequence of curves @xmath229 in the @xmath89-skeleton of @xmath48 which bound images of disks in @xmath48 , with boundary mapped to @xmath229 , but there is no recursive function that bounds the complexity of the image , in terms of number of edges in @xmath229 .",
    "the complex @xmath86 will be built by adding a new circle @xmath90 to the wedge of circles corresponding to generators of @xmath26 , and a new disk defining the relation @xmath230 , where here @xmath229 means the corresponding word to the curve @xmath229 .",
    "thus curves @xmath90 and @xmath229 represent the same class in @xmath231 .",
    "the complex @xmath86 embeds in @xmath5 by theorem [ theorem : main ] .",
    "let @xmath232 be a regular neighborhood of the embedded complex . in case @xmath227 it is easily seen that the @xmath90 bound disks in @xmath232 but in our setting this is not immediate .",
    "anyways , we assume for now that the curves @xmath90 bound disks in @xmath232 . again",
    ", the complexity of these disks is not bounded by any recursive function , otherwise we could solve the word problem for the group by an algorithm .",
    "we can assume that @xmath232 is triangulated by a subcomplex of a simplicial complex triangulating a ball in @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath233 be the complex which is the closure of complement of @xmath232 union with the @xmath89-skeleton of @xmath232 .",
    "now we build the complex @xmath234 by gluing a disk along @xmath90 to @xmath233 and we consider the pair @xmath235 with the given embedding of @xmath233 . then it is easy to see that the embedding problem for these codimension @xmath236 pairs is undecidable since it is equivalent to the triviality problem for the @xmath90 in @xmath232 .",
    "next we reduce the dimension to @xmath237 .",
    "this is done by removing @xmath238-simplices and @xmath239-simplices from the complexes @xmath233 and @xmath234 .",
    "we have to show that removing these simplices does not affect the computability of our problem .",
    "indeed , the complementary space of the @xmath83-skeleton of @xmath233 in the given embedding has fundamental group @xmath240 free product with a free group . to see this",
    "consider the complementary space of @xmath233 at the beginning as an open subset of @xmath241 , i.e. interior of @xmath232 ( adding @xmath89-skeleton of @xmath232 does not change fundamental group of complement of @xmath93 ) .",
    "now removing @xmath238-simplices has the effect of adding disjoint open @xmath238-simplices to this complement .",
    "hence the fundamental group does not change . removing @xmath242-simplices from @xmath233 means adding relatively open @xmath242-simplices to the complement .",
    "each such simplex is incident on at most two @xmath238-simplices and changes the fundamental group if and only if the two had been connected before in the space . in other words ,",
    "the nerve of the collection of @xmath238-simplices and @xmath242-simplices is a graph hence has free fundamental group . since free product with a finitely generated free group",
    "does not change computability it follows that we can replace @xmath235 with its @xmath83-skeleton and the theorem follows .",
    "it remains to show that the curve @xmath90 bounds a disk in @xmath232 .",
    "first observe that in ( the embedding of ) @xmath86 , each edge of @xmath90 is incident on only one triangle , and there is a point on an edge of @xmath90 with a positive distance from the complex minus a neighborhood of that point .",
    "this implies that there is a transverse sphere for the triangle incident on that edge .",
    "if @xmath229 bounds an image of a disk in @xmath232 , then it also bounds an immersed disk which intersects itself in disjoint points and transversely at those points in @xmath232 .",
    "then @xmath90 will bound an immersed disk which consists of the immersed disk bounded by @xmath229 and image of the disk introducing the relation @xmath243 .",
    "using some transverse spheres of the part of the disk incident on @xmath90 self - intersections of the disk bounded by @xmath90 can be removed by tubing and hence @xmath90 will bound an embedded disk .",
    "we refer to @xcite chapter 1 for definition of transverse spheres and how to remove intersections using them .",
