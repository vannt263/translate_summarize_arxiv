    "a long - standing goal in theoretical high - energy physics is to understand the dynamics of gauge theory beyond perturbation theory .",
    "this is particularly important for qcd where non - perturbative effects are responsible for many , if not most , of the physical behaviour of the theory . while the lattice offers one hope to address this problem in a very explicit way , it is often the case that a continuum picture , even qualitative , can be a rich source of insight .    such a continuum picture  of confinement and other non - perturbative effects in gauge theory",
    " has been conjectured by many outstanding physicists since the early 1970 s .",
    "while beautiful and reasonably convincing physical pictures of qcd emerged from this analysis , it proved very hard to substantiate much of this thinking by evidence , even `` theoretical evidence '' .    what is theoretical evidence ?",
    "in the last five years , we understand this term much better .",
    "conjectures about strongly - coupled gauge theory can not be proved without having a definite and effective computational procedure in mind , and this is still lacking at present .",
    "but there is a more realistic goal : having formulated a conjecture , one can make a large list of its consequences , and then hope to isolate , from this list , a few consequences that can actually be theoretically tested .",
    "this then constitutes a body of theoretical evidence for the conjecture .",
    "supersymmetry and string theory have turned out to be the twin planks on which a large body of theoretical evidence , embodied in `` duality symmetries '' , has accumulated over the last few years . since not",
    "all high - energy physicists are interested in the goal of string theory ( to unify all four fundamental interactions , including gravity , into a consistent quantum theory ) , i have chosen to focus this talk on the areas in which a more or less conventional particle physicist can gain insight from string theory .    along with string theory",
    ", supersymmetry will turn out to be a key ingredient in our story .",
    "supersymmetry is accepted by most high - energy physicists as a plausible proposal for what the world is like above a tev or so .",
    "even if this proposal turns out not to be correct , string theory might still be a helpful way to understand the correct field theory .",
    "this is because many of the `` miraculous '' symmetries of string theory that we will use , might well be present even in the absence of supersymmetry .",
    "it is our knowledge of non - supersymmetric string theory that is still insufficient to put it to the service of gauge theory .",
    "this review should be fairly accessible to readers who are not knowledgeable about string theory .",
    "such readers may , however , wish to consult refs.@xcite to learn more about the subject .",
    "to set the stage for our discussions , it is useful to review the structure of supersymmetric gauge fields in 4 spacetime dimensions@xcite",
    ". supersymmetry requires different bosonic and fermionic fields to fall into multiplets .      with @xmath0 supersymmetry",
    "we have two possible multiplets .",
    "the first is a vector multiplet : : a^a _ , ^a , a=1 , ",
    ", dim  g consisting of a gauge field and a majorana spinor ( `` gaugino '' ) in the adjoint of the gauge group g.    the second multiplet , called the `` chiral multiplet '' , contains no gauge fields but only scalars and fermions : : _ i^i , _",
    "i^i , i=1, ",
    ",dim  r ,   i=1, ",
    ",n_f where r is a representation of the gauge group g , and @xmath1 denotes the number of flavours .",
    "the scalars in this multiplet are usually called `` squarks '' since that is what they would be if we were writing a supersymmetric version of the standard model .    together ,",
    "supersymmetry and gauge symmetry constrain the most general renormalizable classical action one can write with these fields . the action is made up of three terms : s = s_kinetic + s_d - term + s_superpotential where @xmath2 contains the usual kinetic terms for all the fields , and & s_d - term & = d^4x _ a=1^dim  g(_i^i^t^a_ij ^j_i)^2 + fermions + & s_superpotential & = d^4x _ i , i | w^i_i|^2 + fermions where @xmath3 is an analytic function of the complex field on which it depends , and is called the `` superpotential '' .",
    "supersymmetry allows this to be arbitrary , but for renormalizability it should be at most cubic in its argument .    with @xmath4 supersymmetry",
    "we again have two possible multiplets .",
    "the first is again called a vector multiplet but its content is different from the @xmath0 vector multiplet : a^a _ , ^a , ^a , a = 1  dim  g here @xmath5 is a dirac gaugino , while @xmath6 is a complex scalar field in the adjoint .",
    "this multiplet is actually the combination of a vector and a chiral multiplet of @xmath0 supersymmetry .",
    "the second multiplet of @xmath4 supersymmetry is called a `` hypermultiplet '' and has the following content : q^i_i , ^i_i , ^i_i , ^i_i , i = 1  dim  r ,   i = 1  n_f where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are complex scalars in the representation @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively of the gauge group , and @xmath11 are weyl fermions in the same representations .",
    "thus the hypermultiplet is a combination of two chiral multiplets of @xmath0 supersymmetry , in conjugate representations .",
    "the most general renormalizable action compatible with @xmath4 supersymmetry is : s = s_kinetic + s_2 + s_superpotential where s_2 & = & d^4x _ a |f^abc |^b ^c|^2 + fermions + s_superpotential & = & d^4x |w|^2 + fermions + w(^a , q^i_i , q^i_i ) & = & q^i_i ^a t^a_ij q^j_i + m_ij q^i_i q^i_j there is an @xmath12 @xmath13-symmetry under which @xmath5 decomposes into a doublet .",
    "the squarks @xmath14 also form an @xmath15 doublet .    with @xmath16 supersymmetry",
    "there is only a single multiplet , called the vector multiplet : a^a _ , ^a_r , ^a_r , a = 1  dim  g ,  r = 1  6 ,  r = 1 4 in terms of @xmath4 super - multiplets , this is a combination of a vector multiplet and an adjoint hypermultiplet , while in @xmath0 language this is a combination of a vector multiplet and three adjoint chiral multiplets .",
    "with such a high degree of supersymmetry , the action is completely determined if we allow only renormalizable ( dimension 4 ) interactions .",
    "it takes the form : s & = & s_kinetic + s_2 + s_2 & = & d^4x ( ^6_r , s=1 |f^abc ^b_r ^c_s|^2 + fermions ) this is the maximally supersymmetric situation if we restrict ourselves to field theories in 3 + 1 dimensions without gravity . in components , there are 16 supersymmetry charges ( 4 majorana spinors of 4 components each ) .      the parameter space , or `` moduli space '' , of a field theory is the space of degenerate vacuum configurations",
    ". this amounts to the space of energy - minimising vacuum expectation values of various scalar fields .",
    "classically , this is easy to determine by examining the lagrangian and looking for flat directions in field space along which the potential does not vary .",
    "quantum mechanically , one has to replace the lagrangian by the effective lagrangian incorporating quantum corrections .    without supersymmetry ,",
    "there is often no moduli space since the potential will have a unique minimum .",
    "even if we choose a potential with flat directions , quantum corrections will generically lift this degeneracy .",
    "however , with supersymmetry , the classical moduli space is already constrained and moreover , quantum corrections can fail to lift degeneracies because of cancellations between fermion and boson loops . we will denote the classical moduli space by @xmath17 and the quantum moduli space by @xmath18 .",
    "the moduli spaces are most constrained when there is the greatest degree of supersymmetry .",
    "hence in this discussion we start with the maximally supersymmetric case .    in this case , the classical moduli space consists of those vacuum expectation values of the 6 scalars which together minimise the potential energy .",
    "the result is simple but interesting .",
    "we require : _ r , s ( f^abc ^b_r ^c_s)^2 = 0 where the scalar fields are understood to represent the vev s .",
    "positivity implies f^abc ^b_r ^c_s = 0  for  all  a , r , s this condition will be satisfied if and only if the vev s all lie in the cartan subalgebra of the gauge group : ^_r & &   arbitrary ,  = 1  rank  g + ^a_r & & = 0 ,  a = ( rank  g ) + 1 , ",
    ", dim  g recall that @xmath19 takes values from 1 to 6 , labelling the 6 scalar fields in the vector multiplet .    as a simple example ,",
    "with gauge group @xmath20 , we have ^3_r  arbitrary ,   ^1,2_r = 0  ( r=1,  ,6 ) it is convenient to label the vev s by a collection of 6-vectors : ^_r = v^_r = ( v^_1 , v^_2 ,  , v^_6 ) = v^then , the classical moduli space is the space of all 6-vectors @xmath21 .",
    "however , there are global identifications by the weyl group of @xmath22 , a discrete subgroup which must still be imposed as a gauge symmetry .",
    "thus the true classical moduli space is really the quotient of the naive one by this group .",
    "the weyl group of @xmath20 is just @xmath23 , while for general @xmath24 it is the permutation group @xmath25 .",
    "thus the classical moduli space in these cases is : su(2 ) : & = & * r*^6/z_2 + su(n_c ) : & = & * r*^6(n_c-1)/s_n_c    let us consider the @xmath20 case in more detail .",
    "* r*@xmath26 has coordinates @xmath27 .",
    "the action of the weyl group is : z_2 : - v there is a fixed point of this action at @xmath28 .",
    "this is the point where @xmath20 gauge symmetry is restored , since the adjoint scalar vev s all vanish .",
    "elsewhere , @xmath29 breaks @xmath20 to @xmath30 .",
    "geometrically , a fixed point of the quotienting group corresponds to a singularity of the space .",
    "the space becomes an _",
    ", so while it is flat everywhere else , it has infinite curvature at the origin .    far away from the origin ( @xmath31 ) , the off - diagonal @xmath20 gauge particles , which we may denote @xmath32 , are massive , with a mass @xmath33 . as @xmath34 , these gauge particles become massless .",
    "we see that singularities of the moduli space @xmath35 are associated to the presence of new massless particles in the spectrum .    for @xmath24 ,",
    "at a generic point of @xmath17 we have the symmetry - breaking pattern : @xmath36 note that the cartan subgroup @xmath37 of @xmath24 can never be broken by the vev of an adjoint scalar ( since adjoint scalars are uncharged under this subgroup ) .",
    "hence at such generic points we always have a number ( @xmath38 ) of massless photons , and the theory is in the coulomb phase .    however , there are special points where the breaking pattern is different : su(n_c ) & & su(2 ) ( u(1))^n_c-2 + [ 2 mm ] & & su(3 ) ( u(1))^n_c-3 + [ 2 mm ] & & su(2 ) su(3 ) u(1 ) and so on .",
    "all such points have `` enhanced nonabelian symmetry '' , hence extra massless particles .",
    "these points are fixed under the action of some element of @xmath25 , hence they are singularities of the moduli space .",
    "in addition to the above moduli space , there is the parameter space for the gauge coupling @xmath39 and the @xmath40-angle , which combine into a complex parameter : _ ym = 2 + 4i g^2_ym [ yangmills ] in field theory these parameters are fixed by hand and are quite distinct from vev s of scalar fields .",
    "however , in string theory they arise as vev s of some appropriate scalar fields , hence string theorists usually consider this parameter space to be part of the moduli space .    in this case , there are other phases besides the coulomb phase .",
    "thus the classical moduli space @xmath17 splits into branches .",
    "one branch is characterised by the following : q^i_i & = & q^i_i = 0 + ^&= & v^ , = 1 ,  , rank  g note that with @xmath4 supersymmetry , the field @xmath41 and its vev @xmath42 are _ complex _ numbers .",
    "the above equation defines the `` coulomb branch '' , on which as before , the generic breaking pattern is : su(n_c ) ( u(1))^n_c-1 in particular , for @xmath20 we have the coulomb branch : ^coulomb = * r*^2/z_2 where @xmath43 is the ( complex ) coordinate on @xmath44 .    at generic points of @xmath45",
    "we can not give a vev to @xmath46 , since their couplings to the adjoint scalars would increase the potential energy .",
    "but it is not hard to see that if @xmath42 takes some special values , then we can turn on vev s for @xmath47 at no cost in energy .",
    "since the hypermultiplets are usually in the fundamental representation , they are charged under the cartan subgroup of the gauge group .",
    "hence such vev s break even @xmath30 factors .",
    "this branch of the moduli space is therefore called the higgs branch .    in this case",
    "the vector multiplet contains no scalars , hence there is no moduli space unless we couple some chiral ( matter ) multiplets . with matter",
    ", we have to minimize @xmath48 the result for @xmath17 depends on the details of the fields , representations and choice of superpotential .",
    "not much can be said about it without going into a detailed classification of cases .",
    "we see that the classical moduli space @xmath17 is relatively simple for @xmath16 and consists of a coulomb phase , while for @xmath4 supersymmetry , it consists of intersecting coulomb and higgs branches . with @xmath0 supersymmetry",
    ", the moduli space depends largely on one s choice of field content and superpotential in the theory .",
    "we now turn to the question of how quantum corrections modify the classical moduli space of a supersymmetric gauge theory . in general , the quantum effective action will be different from the classical one and will incorporate non - renormalizable terms , including more general kinetic terms than the usual ones .    because of the high degree of supersymmetry , the quantum moduli space @xmath18 is identical to the classical one @xmath17 . at the origin of @xmath18",
    ", the theory has unbroken @xmath24 gauge symmetry and vanishing @xmath49-function .",
    "thus , it is a conformal field theory ( cft ) .",
    "note that as a consequence there is no asymptotic freedom , and hence also no confinement , in this theory .",
    "away from the origin , conformal invariance is broken by the scalar vev and we have massive theory coupled to @xmath30 gauge fields .",
    "consider @xmath20 gauge theory with no hypermultiplets .",
    "it was shown non - perturbatively , by seiberg and witten@xcite , that the structure of @xmath18 is rather different from that of @xmath17 .",
    "whereas in @xmath17 the coulomb branch is singular at the origin and @xmath20 gauge symmetry is restored there , in @xmath18 the coulomb branch has no singularity at the origin .",
    "moreover , in this theory @xmath20 gauge symmetry is _ never _ restored at any point of the moduli space !    instead , it is found that there are two other singular points in @xmath18 . at these points ,",
    "some particles do become massless  but not the gauge bosons .",
    "the massless particles at these points are monopoles and dyons .",
    "it becomes useful to make an electric - magnetic duality transformation near these points and study the magnetic theory instead .",
    "this @xmath50 theory has a nontrivial @xmath49-function and is asymptotically free , so the coupling @xmath51 depends on the scale .",
    "this coupling was shown to vary complex analytically ( `` holomorphically '' ) as a function of the complex vev @xmath52 : so we can write @xmath53 .",
    "this dependence is known exactly as a certain non - trivial `` fibre bundle '' . since",
    "@xmath54 is valued in the upper half plane , it can naturally be interpreted as the `` shape '' parameter ( technically , `` complex structure parameter '' ) of a torus , thus the moduli space looks like a torus varying over a plane .",
    "the above holds for @xmath20 gauge group and @xmath55 ( no matter ) .",
    "analogous exact results for @xmath4 supersymmetry are also known for @xmath24 gauge groups and for @xmath56 flavours , for which the theories are always asymptotically free . for @xmath57 these theories",
    "are finite ( the @xmath49-function vanishes ) and hence they are conformal field theories .",
    "for @xmath58 the @xmath49-function is positive and the theory becomes ill - defined .",
    "note that the interesting results about quantum corrections always concern the coulomb branch .",
    "the higgs branch is protected from quantum corrections .",
    "a complex array of results have been found for the quantum moduli space of @xmath59 supersymmetric gauge theories .",
    "however , just as the classical moduli space in this case depends on the detailed choice of matter fields , representations and couplings , the structure of @xmath18 too will depend on these choices .",
    "the interested reader is referred to appropriate review articles on this topic , such as ref.@xcite .",
    "in this section we show how supersymmetric gauge theories in 3 + 1 spacetime dimensions naturally arise as a subsector of superstring theory . for a more detailed review of the relevant material on d - branes , see ref.@xcite .",
    "introducing fundamental extended objects such as strings leads to a variety of interesting new physical consequences .",
    "for one thing , closed string excitations produce gravity , so string theories are theories of quantum gravity .",
    "but we will be more interested in the sector of string theory that contains open strings .",
    "open strings have a pair of ends .",
    "this requires the specification of boundary conditions at the endpoints .",
    "while it is most natural to allow these to lie anywhere in space , one can consistently choose to restrict the endpoints onto a @xmath60-dimensional spatial hypersurface in the 9-dimensional space where strings propagate .",
    "in fact , one can show that such choices must necessarily be consistent : starting with unconstrained endpoints and applying known symmetries of string theory , we end up with endpoints constrained on a hypersurface .    what is the physical interpretation of these constrained endpoints ?",
    "they define a spatial region on which the strings can end .",
    "suppose we choose @xmath61 and constrain our open strings to end on a fixed point in space .",
    "then , that point breaks translation invariance exactly as an elementary particle would do .",
    "( for example , applying a lorentz boost to the theory would cause the point to start moving with a fixed velocity ) .",
    "fluctuations of the string give rise to motions and oscillations of this fixed endpoint .",
    "hence in all respects this string endpoint can be treated as a particle with a definite mass . because constrained endpoints satisfy dirichlet boundary conditions , we call the associated particle a `` d - particle '' .    d - particles can also be understood as solitonic excitations in the string theory .",
    "hence we have two different mental pictures of the same object : as a soliton , and as a string endpoint .",
    "now suppose we choose @xmath62 instead of 0 .",
    "then the string endpoint sweeps out a 2-dimensional space .",
    "the associated object looks like a membrane .",
    "indeed , it is called a `` d - brane '' .",
    "it too has a complementary description as an extended solitonic excitation in string theory , much like the cosmic strings and domain walls that can be found as classical solutions of more physically relevant field theories . for arbitrary @xmath60",
    ", we say that the string endpoint describes a d@xmath60-brane .    for suitable values of @xmath60 ,",
    "d@xmath60-branes are stable objects in type ii superstring theory .",
    "they are charged under some generalised gauge field and hence , in the solitonic picture , they correspond to stable solitons .",
    "a key property of open superstrings is that their lowest excitations are massless gauge fields .",
    "these gauge fields propagate only on the locus where the endpoints are free to move , namely on the d@xmath60-brane .",
    "thus , the low - energy field theory coming from the dynamics of open strings is a gauge theory in @xmath63 spacetime dimensions .",
    "this is the central observation that links string theory and gauge field theory . for our purposes we will select the value @xmath64 , so",
    "we intend to realise the supersymmetric field theories discussed in the preceding sections as modes of open strings ending on d3-branes .",
    "the underlying string theory which has stable d3-branes is called type iib string theory .",
    "because of supersymmetry , the gauge fields arising from open string endpoints lie in supermultiplets containing scalars and fermions .",
    "the basic d3-brane of type iib string theory can be shown to inherit @xmath16 supersymmetry from the underlying spacetime supersymmetry of the 10-dimensional string theory .",
    "hence the theory on the worldvolume of a single d3-brane is an @xmath16 supersymmetric gauge theory .",
    "a single d3-brane gives rise to abelian gauge theory .",
    "we will argue below that to get higher gauge groups one must stack several identical d3-branes together .",
    "we will also see that lower supersymmetry can be obtained by combining d3-branes with other d - branes and `` orientifolds '' .    before doing this ,",
    "let us note one amusing fact .",
    "a soliton has `` collective coordinates '' for the symmetries that it breaks .",
    "in particular , extended solitons ( branes ) break translational invariance in the directions transverse to their own world - volume .",
    "for example , suppose a d3-brane is arranged to lie along @xmath65 .",
    "it breaks the remaining 6 translational symmetries in the @xmath66 dimensional string theory , along @xmath67 .",
    "so it should have 6 massless scalar fields on its world - volume . and",
    "it does , because @xmath16 supersymmetry requires precisely 6 scalar fields in a vector multiplet !",
    "we see that the 6 scalar fields in the @xmath16 supersymmetry multiplet , whose presence was deduced from the supersymmetry algebra long before superstrings and d - branes were understood , are most naturally interpreted as translational collective coordinates of a d3-brane .",
    "moreover , the @xmath68 r - symmetry comes from transverse rotational invariance : the 10-dimensional lorentz group @xmath69 is broken by the d3-brane into @xmath70 .",
    "thus r - symmetry ( a key property of field theories with extended supersymmetry ) gets re - interpreted as a spacetime symmetry .",
    "now consider two parallel d3-branes ( fig.1 ) . both are aligned along @xmath71 but they can be at arbitrary locations in the other six directions .",
    "we let the vector @xmath72 denote the relative location of one brane with respect to the other along these directions .    from the previous discussion",
    "we should expect that together , these d3-branes support a @xmath73 @xmath16 supersymmetric gauge theory .",
    "the two vector multiplets arise from open strings having both ends on the first brane or both ends on the second brane .",
    "but now we also have two more types of open strings : those beginning on the first brane and ending on the second , and those beginning on the second brane and ending on the first .",
    "the corresponding states are charged as @xmath74 and @xmath75 under @xmath76 . under the diagonal @xmath30",
    "they are neutral . with respect to the other @xmath30",
    ", they have exactly the charges of massive w - bosons ! in fact their mass is [ masscharge ] m_w ~t |v| where @xmath77 is the string tension . in suitable units , this is related to the yang - mills coupling constant for the d3-brane gauge theory by @xmath78 .",
    "( note that @xmath79 in this section is a distance , while in the previous sections it was the vev of a scalar field .",
    "the translation between these two involves a change of units and some rescaling . )",
    "particles obeying a mass - charge relationship like the one above correspond to quantum states in the gauge theory that do not break all the underlying supersymmetry ( as a generic state would do ) but preserve a fraction of supersymmetry . such states are known as `` bps states '' , and the corresponding particles are necessarily stable by virtue of the supersymmetry that they preserve .",
    "thus , two parallel d3-branes realize the coulomb branch of @xmath80 @xmath20 gauge theory ( apart from a decoupled centre - of - mass @xmath30 ) @xcite .",
    "when the parallel d3-branes coincide , the stretched open strings shrink to zero length , and @xmath81 .",
    "there , @xmath20 is restored .",
    "this is the origin of the coulomb branch .",
    "since d - branes are indistinguishable objects , the parameter space is @xmath82 , as we predicted from purely field - theoretic considerations .",
    "thus we see that in string theory , the weyl group factor in the gauge group comes from d - brane statistics !    for @xmath9 parallel , separated d3-branes we have the following picture .",
    "the total number of stretched strings between pairs of d3-branes is @xmath83 .",
    "add @xmath9 strings that begin and end on the same brane , and we end up with @xmath84 fields altogether . this is the dimension of the group @xmath85 .",
    "so , @xmath9 parallel d3-branes describe the moduli space of @xmath86 @xmath16 supersymmetric gauge theories ( fig.2 ) .",
    "we have already identified some stable bps states @xmath87 bosons ) in these theories .",
    "these carry electric charge under the @xmath30 factors .",
    "now let us use string duality to extract more information .",
    "the type iib string in 10 dimensions has a pair of massless scalar particles : the dilaton @xmath88 , and the axion @xmath89 .",
    "these appear naturally in the complex combination _",
    "s = 2 + 4i e^- = 2 + 4i g_s we have used the fact , well - known to string theorists , that the string coupling is determined by the expectation value of the dilaton field : @xmath90 .",
    "since the modes propagating on the d3-brane are excitations of open strings , they `` inherit '' this coupling .",
    "in fact , the complex combination @xmath91 of yang - mills coupling and theta - angle which we encountered in eq .",
    "( [ yangmills ] ) is equal to the complex combination @xmath92 above : _",
    "ym = 2 + 4i g^2_ym = _ s = 2 + 4i g_s hence , in particular , @xmath93 .",
    "now , it is believed that type iib string theory has a group of duality symmetries , sl(2,*z * ) , under which _ s ,   sl(2,*z * ) this group of transformations includes , as a special case , a simple integer shift of the axion , @xmath94 which tells us that it is an angle - valued field .",
    "it also includes the more nontrivial strong - weak coupling duality ( `` s - duality '' ) @xmath95 which for zero axion acts as @xmath96 , inverting strong and weak coupling in the string theory .    under s - duality , we know how all the massless fields of type iib string transform .",
    "since d - branes carry charges under specific massless fields , this also tells us how the branes transform .",
    "in particular one finds that s - duality converts the fundamental type ii string into a d1-brane or `` d - string '' , but leaves the d3-brane invariant .",
    "it follows that @xmath16 supersymmetric gauge theory must have a symmetry under @xmath97 for vanishing @xmath40-angle , this includes a transformation @xmath98 , which interchanges a weakly coupled gauge theory with a strongly coupled one .",
    "in addition , we saw that this duality acts on the string theory to interchange a fundamental type iib string with a d - string .",
    "but we know that the end - point of a fundamental string when it terminates on a brane behaves like an electrically charged particle of the brane worldvolume theory",
    ". it is also known that the endpoint of a d - string when it terminates on a brane , behaves like a magnetically charged particle @xcite .",
    "thus when acting on a d3-brane , s - duality must interchange electric with magnetic fields .",
    "thus , stringy s - duality implies strong - weak , electric - magnetic duality of @xmath16 supersymmetric gauge theory .",
    "this in turn implies the existence of a definite spectrum of monopoles and dyons as a consequence of the existence of electrically charged w - bosons , which can be identified as perturbative states .",
    "while this result was originally argued from field - theoretic considerations @xcite , this way of understanding it through string theory is very powerful and conceptually illuminating .",
    "( it is not as rigorous , though , since the string duality that we invoke remains a conjecture , which is in some ways harder to prove or justify than the field - theoretic duality ) .",
    "here we have seen perhaps the simplest example wherein , by realising a field theory in terms of worldvolume excitations on a brane , one can derive properties of this field theory using known ( or conjectured ) properties of the underlying string theory .",
    "these results are nonperturbative , since the duality acts non - perturbatively .    for general gauge groups @xmath24 , one re - discovers in this way a rich and complex spectrum of bps monopoles and dyons , which field theorists had been slowly discovering over the last two decades .    for @xmath99",
    ", @xmath24 gauge theory also admits exotic bps dyons whose existence had been conjectured ( but not demonstrated ) by field theorists .",
    "such dyons have electric and magnetic charge vectors that are not proportional .",
    "string theory can be used to show that they must exist .",
    "one starts with the fact that type iib string theory admits bps junctions where a fundamental string meets a d - string and a bound - state of the two comes out from the junction point ( fig.3 ) .",
    "more general junctions also exist .    following the observation that string junctions are stable , bps objects , @xcite ,",
    "it was argued @xcite that an exotic dyon is obtained by suspending such a string junction between d3-branes .",
    "such dyons exist in all @xmath24 @xmath16 supersymmetric theories , for @xmath100 , and are stable .",
    "with this impetus , field theorists began to generate the appropriate classical solutions for such field - theoretic solitons , and quite a lot is known about them by now .",
    "type iib symmetric is invariant under orientation - reversal of the closed string .",
    "this symmetry , denoted @xmath101 , generates a @xmath23 group and has a definite action on the fields of the theory ( and therefore , as we have seen , also on the branes ) .",
    "let us compactify iib string theory on a 2-torus , with coordinates @xmath102 , and take the quotient by the symmetry @xmath103 where @xmath104 denotes reflection of the two toroidal directions : @xmath105 as we might expect , @xmath101 creates unoriented closed strings out of oriented ones , and @xmath106 makes the two toroidal space dimensions into the orbifold @xmath107 ( details about orientifolds can be found in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the reflection symmetry has 4 fixed points on @xmath108 .",
    "let us focus on one of them , say the one at the origin .",
    "this is a point on the 2-torus , but it is independent of the other 7 spatial directions and is therefore a 7-dimensional hyperplane that extends along those directions .",
    "we call it an `` orientifold 7-plane '' .",
    "this object is like a mirror : the spatial regions on the two opposite sides of it get identified .",
    "if we bring a d3-brane near it , we get new light states coming from open strings joining the d3-brane to its mirror image ( fig.4 ) .",
    "these become massless precisely when the d3-brane meets the orientifold 7-plane .",
    "this leads to two effects .",
    "the 7-plane breaks the supersymmetry on the d3-brane ( which was originally @xmath16 ) down to @xmath4 .",
    "the other effect is that out of four open string sectors on a pair of d3-branes , one is projected out , leading to an @xmath20 gauge group rather than @xmath109 .",
    "the result is pure @xmath4 supersymmetric gauge theory with @xmath20 gauge group .",
    "this means that the moduli space of that theory must be given by the geometric space encountered by the d3-brane .",
    "in fact , we have recovered the classical moduli space @xmath110 of this theory !    what about quantum effects ? in the presence of this orientifold plane ,",
    "the type iib theory becomes a `` type - i '' string theory with reduced supersymmetry .",
    "it was shown @xcite , following the construction of `` f - theory '' @xcite , that quantum effects split the orientifold 7-plane into two dynamical 7-branes .",
    "these 7-branes do not allow a type iib string to end on them .",
    "so there are no massless `` w - bosons '' when the d3-brane touches them .",
    "however , they allow dyonic @xmath111 strings ( bound states of @xmath60 fundamental strings and @xmath112 d - strings ) to end on them . since the end point of a fundamental string on a d3-brane is an electric charge , and the endpoint of a d - string on a d3-brane is a magnetic charge , it must be true that the endpoint of a @xmath111 string is a dyon of electric charge @xmath60 and magnetic charge @xmath112 .",
    "hence when the d3-brane touches either of the d7-branes , we get corresponding massless @xmath111 dyons .    we have recovered an essential part of the seiberg - witten picture .",
    "the origin of the coulomb branch has split into two singularities where dyons become massless .",
    "there is no point where w - bosons become massless .    to complete the picture",
    ", we use the existence of `` f - theory '' @xcite , which is a novel way of compactifying the type iib string where its coupling @xmath92 is allowed to vary over the compact manifold .",
    "since the d3-brane inherits this coupling , the gauge coupling @xmath91 too varies over the @xmath113-plane ( where @xmath114 ) exactly as predicted by seiberg and witten .",
    "the seiberg - witten torus , which was a mathematical artifact in their solution , is realised geometrically : it turns out to be the torus whose shape is parametrised by @xmath89 ( the axion ) and @xmath88 ( the dilaton ) .",
    "we can also introduce d7-branes parallel to the orientifold plane , this gives rise to ( massive ) hypermultiplets coupled to the pure @xmath4 gauge theory . in this way one",
    "recovers the more general seiberg - witten theories incorporating @xmath4 matter multiplets , and the higgs branch appears as well .",
    "one can use this stringy setup to predict new field - theoretic phenomena .",
    "the usual seiberg - witten theories have a maximal flavour symmetry group @xmath115 , which is realised in the case of four massless flavours .",
    "however , it was argued @xcite that some configurations of 7-branes give rise to gauge theories on the 3-brane with @xmath116 global symmetry .",
    "this phenomenon ( unlike the familiar @xmath115 case ) can not occur at weak coupling .",
    "it is a new non - perturbative field - theoretic effect predicted by string theory .",
    "d3-branes have some features that we have not yet explored .",
    "complementary to their description as d - objects ( loci of open - string endpoints ) , they can also be understood as solitonic classical solutions of type iib string theory  more specifically , of its low - energy limit , type iib supergravity .",
    "hence there is a spacetime metric describing the gravitational field around a collection of @xmath9 d3-branes : ds^2 & = & f(r)^- ( - dt^2 + ( dx^1)^2 + ( dx^2)^2 + ( dx^3)^2 ) + [ 2 mm ] & & + f(r)^ ( ( dx^4)^2 + + ( dx^9)^2 ) where f(r ) = 1 + r^4 r^4 , r = ( ( x^4)^2 +  + ( x^9)^2)^ and [ rdef ] r ~(g_s ( )^2 n_c)^14 this metric describes a massive object localised along three spatial directions .",
    "some generalised gauge fields of the low - energy supergravity theory must also be excited to make this a genuine classical solution . as a result",
    ", the solution describes a charged object .",
    "in fact , it is supersymmetric ( bps ) , and has a mass - charge relationship analogous to that in eq.([masscharge ] ) , except that mass is replaced by mass per unit 3-volume or `` brane tension '' .",
    "something remarkable happens in the limit of large @xmath13 ( which , from eq.([rdef ] ) is the same as large @xmath117 ) . from the form of @xmath118 above",
    ", this limit is equivalent to the `` near - horizon '' limit @xmath119 in which we probe the metric very close to the brane . in this limit",
    ", we can make the replacement f(r ) = 1 + r^4 r^4    r^4 r^4 and as a result the spacetime metric around @xmath9 d3-branes becomes : ds^2 & = & r^2 r^2 ( -dt^2 + ( dx^1)^2 + ( dx^2)^2 + ( dx^3)^2 ) + r^2 r^2 ( dr^2 + r^2 ( d _ 5)^2 ) + [ 2 mm ] & = & \\{r^2 r^2(-dt^2 + ( dx^1)^2 + ( dx^2)^2 + ( dx^3)^2 ) + r^2 dr^2 r^2 } + r^2 ( d _ 5)^2 the factor in large braces is the metric of a @xmath120-dimensional space - time called `` anti - desitter '' , and denoted @xmath121 , while the last term is the metric of a 5-sphere .",
    "thus we have shown that the near - horizon metric of @xmath9 d3-branes is the space - time @xmath122 .",
    "as @xmath9 grows , the near - horizon region expands . in the limit of infinite @xmath9 ,",
    "the entire spacetime ( not just near the branes ) is @xmath123 .",
    "based on these facts , maldacena @xcite made a novel conjecture . according to this , the following two descriptions of d3-branes for large @xmath9 are equivalent :    \\(i ) the description as the limit of @xmath16 supersymmetric gauge theory",
    "as @xmath124 becomes large ,    \\(ii ) the description as the nontrivial spacetime background @xmath125 of type iib string theory .",
    "this is a duality between on one hand a gauge theory , and on the other hand a theory of gravity and strings .",
    "it is remarkable how the symmetries of the problem match up in the two descriptions . in the gravity description , we have the symmetry groups @xmath126 and @xmath68 , making up the isometries of the maximally symmetric spaces @xmath121 and @xmath127 respectively",
    ". in the gauge theory description , @xmath126 is realised as the conformal symmetry group of @xmath128-dimensional gauge theory , which includes the poincare group . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath129 is the r - symmetry group of @xmath16 supersymmetric yang - mills theory .",
    "if we are only interested in the leading behaviour in the limit of large @xmath130 , we can really ignore string theory in favour of its low energy limit , type iib supergravity .",
    "this is because the massive stringy modes decouple in this limit .",
    "precise prescriptions have been given @xcite to relate correlation functions in @xmath16 gauge theory to computations in supergravity .",
    "this opens up the possibility of solving the quantum gauge theory completely in the large-@xmath9 limit just using the classical lagrangian of supergravity !    some of the remarkable results obtained in this direction concern the computation of expectation values of wilson loops @xcite , properties of baryons and domain walls @xcite , and thermal properties and phase transitions in gauge theory @xcite .",
    "the correspondence was also extended to the case of lower supersymmetry : @xmath4 , @xmath0 , and even @xmath131 ( no supersymmetry ) @xcite .",
    "an interesting example of lower supersymmetry is a case with @xmath0 supersymmetry in four dimensions .",
    "this arises by placing @xmath9 d3-branes at the singular tip of a singular noncompact manifold called a `` conifold '' .",
    "one finds in this case an interesting @xmath0 supersymmetric field theory on the d3-branes , which exhibits a nontrivial flow in the infrared to a superconformal field theory @xcite .",
    "a dual brane description of this was found @xcite which leads to a description of the field theory and its symmetries using strongly coupled string theory or `` m - theory '' .",
    "string theory has found a new role : to help in `` solving '' gauge theories non - perturbatively .",
    "such solutions range from a qualitative understanding of the theories , including their symmetries , to a detailed description of the moduli space in the same sense that seiberg and witten initially achieved using only field theoretic techniques .    due to a shortage of time ,",
    "i could not discuss a fascinating approach to realising field theories in terms of intersecting branes , the so - called `` brane constructions '' @xcite .",
    "these provide much more general examples of the utility of string theory in understanding quantum field theory .",
    "though such constructions exist for various different amounts of supersymmetry upto the maximal case of @xmath16 , it remains true that at present our understanding is best for the most highly supersymmetric , and hence less interesting , gauge theories .",
    "it is important to improve our understanding of theories with @xmath0 supersymmetry , which is the amount of supersymmetry in the mssm ( such theories are dynamically quite similar to non - supersymmetric theories ) .",
    "some partial progress has also been made towards directly studying non - supersymmetric gauge theories using string theory .",
    "the day may not be far off when the standard model will be most easily understood by representing it as a sector of string theory .",
