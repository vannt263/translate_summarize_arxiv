    "on the 10th of february 2000 cern announced the discovery of the novel state of matter  the so - called quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "the existence of the qgp has been predicted upon lattice qcd calculations ( for a review see @xcite and references therein ) and the critical temperature @xmath1 for the ordinary hadron matter - qgp phase transition has been estimated in the range of 150 - 270 mev ( this corresponds to the broad range of the critical energy density @xmath2 gev/@xmath3 ) .",
    "the upper limit belongs to a pure @xmath4 theory , whereas adding quarks causes lowering of @xmath1 even to about 150 mev ( @xmath5 gev/@xmath3 respectively ) . since na50 collaboration estimates for the energy density obtained in the central rapidity region ( crr ) give the value of 3.5 gev/@xmath3 for the most central pb - pb data point @xcite , it is argued that the region of the existence of the qgp has been reached in pb - pb collisions at cern sps .",
    "soon after the announcement , the paper entitled `` evidence for deconfinement of quarks and gluons from the @xmath0 suppression pattern measured in pb - pb collisions at the cern - sps '' appeared @xcite .",
    "as the title suggests , the main argument for the qgp creation during pb - pb collisions at the cern sps is the observation of the suppression of @xmath0 relative yield .",
    "@xmath0 suppression as a signal for the qgp formation was originally proposed by matsui and satz @xcite .",
    "the clue point of the na50 collaboration paper is the figure ( denoted as fig.6 there ) , where experimental data for pb - pb collision values of @xmath6 ( the ratio of the @xmath0 to the drell - yan production cross - section times the branching ratio of the @xmath0 into a muon pair ) are presented together with some conventional predictions . here",
    ", `` conventional '' means that @xmath0 suppression is due to @xmath0 absorption in ordinary hadron matter .",
    "since all those conventional curves saturate at high transverse energy @xmath7 , but the experimental data fall from @xmath8 90 gev much lower and this behaviour could be reproduced on the base of @xmath0 disintegration in qgp @xcite , it is argued that qgp had to appear during most central pb - pb collisions . in general , the immediate reservation about such reasoning is that besides those already known ( see e.g. @xcite and references [ 12 - 15 ] in @xcite ) , there could be a huge number of different conventional models , so until this subject is cleared up completely , no one is legitimate to ruled out the absorption picture of @xmath0 suppression .    in the following talk , the more systematic and general description of @xmath0 absorption in the framework of statistical analysis will be presented .",
    "the main features of the model are @xcite :    * \\1 .",
    "a multi - component non - interacting hadron gas appears in the crr instead of the qgp ; * \\2 .",
    "the gas expands longitudinally and transversely ; * \\3 .",
    "@xmath0 suppression is the result of inelastic scattering on constituents of the gas and on nucleons of colliding ions .",
    "for a given a - b collision @xmath9 is fixed at the moment of the maximal overlap of the nuclei ( for more details see e.g. @xcite ) . as nuclei pass each other charmonium states",
    "are produced as the result of gluon fusion .",
    "after half of the time the nuclei need to cross each other ( @xmath10 0.5 fm ) , matter appears in the crr .",
    "it is assumed that the matter thermalizes almost immediately and the moment of thermalization , @xmath11 , is estimated at about 1 fm @xcite .",
    "then the matter begins its expansion and cooling and after reaching the freeze - out temperature , @xmath12 , it ceases as a thermodynamical system .",
    "the moment when the temperature has decreased to @xmath12 is denoted as @xmath13 .",
    "since the matter under consideration is the hadron gas , any phase transition does not take place during cooling here .    for the description of the evolution of the matter",
    ", relativistic hydrodynamic is explored .",
    "the longitudinal component of the solution of hydrodynamic equations ( the exact analytic solution for an ( 1 + 1)-dimensional case ) reads ( for details see e.g. @xcite )    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is a local proper time , @xmath16 is the @xmath17-component of fluid velocity ( @xmath17 is a collision axis ) and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are initial densities of the entropy and the baryon number respectively . for @xmath20 and the uniform initial temperature distribution with the sharp edge at the border established by nuclei radii ,",
    "the full solution of ( 3 + 1)-dimensional hydrodynamic equations is known @xcite .",
    "the evolution derived is the decomposition of the longitudinal expansion inside a slice bordered by the front of the rarefaction wave and the transverse expansion which is superimposed outside of the wave . because small but nevertheless non - zero baryon number densities are considered here",
    ", the above - mentioned description of the evolution has to be treated as an assumption in the presented model .",
    "the rarefaction wave moves radially inward with a sound velocity @xmath21 .",
    "the sound velocity squared is given by @xmath22 and can be evaluated numerically @xcite .",
    "for an ideal hadron gas in thermal and chemical equilibrium , which consists of @xmath23 species of particles , energy density @xmath24 , baryon number density @xmath25 , strangeness density @xmath26 and entropy density @xmath27 read ( @xmath28 always )    [ eqstate ] @xmath29",
    "@xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32    where @xmath33 and @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the mass , baryon number , strangeness , chemical potential , spin and a statistical factor of specie @xmath40 respectively ( an antiparticle is treated as a different specie ) . and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are overall baryon number and strangeness chemical potentials respectively .    to obtain the time dependence of temperature and baryon number and strangeness chemical potentials one has to solve numerically equations ( [ barnumb ] - [ entropy ] ) with @xmath27 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 given as time dependent quantities . for @xmath44 and @xmath45 expressions ( [ 1 ] ) are taken and @xmath46 since the overall strangeness equals zero during all the evolution ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "as it has been already mentioned in sect .  [ timetable ]",
    "charmonium states are produced in the beginning of the collision , when nuclei overlap . for simplicity , it is assumed that the production of @xmath47 states takes place at @xmath9 . to describe @xmath0 absorption quantitatively ,",
    "the idea of @xcite is generalized to the case of the multi - component massive gas , here . since in the crr longitudinal momenta of particles",
    "are much lower than transverse ones ( in the c.m.s .",
    "frame of nuclei ) , @xmath0 longitudinal momentum is put at zero .",
    "additionally , only the plane @xmath48 is under consideration , here . for the simplicity of the model",
    ", it is assumed that all charmonium states are completely formed and can be absorbed by the constituents of a surrounding medium from the moment of creation .",
    "the absorption is the result of a @xmath47 state inelastic scattering on the constituents of the hadron gas through interactions of the type    @xmath49    where @xmath50 denotes a hadron , @xmath51 is a charm meson and @xmath52 means a particle which is necessary to conserve the charge , baryon number or strangeness .    since the most crucial for the problem of qgp existence are pb - pb collisions ( see remarks in sect .",
    "[ intro ] ) , the further considerations are done for this case .",
    "so , for the pb - pb collision at impact parameter @xmath53 , the situation in the plane @xmath48 is presented in fig.[fig.1 .",
    "] , where @xmath54 means the area of the overlap of the colliding nuclei .",
    "additionally , it is assumed that the hadron gas , which appears in the space between the nuclei after they have crossed each other , also has the shape of @xmath54 at @xmath11 in the plane @xmath48 .",
    "then , the transverse expansion starts in the form of the rarefaction wave moving inward @xmath54 at @xmath11 .    from the considerations based on the relativistic kinetic equation ( for details",
    "see @xcite ) , the survival fraction of @xmath0 in the hadron gas as a function of the initial energy density @xmath55 in the crr is obtained :    @xmath56    where the sum is over all taken species of scatters ( hadrons ) , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are four momenta of @xmath0 and hadron specie @xmath40 respectively , @xmath59 states for the absorption cross - section of @xmath60 scattering , @xmath61 is the relative velocity of @xmath62 hadron with respect to @xmath0 and @xmath63 and @xmath34 denote @xmath0 and @xmath62 masses respectively ( @xmath64 mev ) .",
    "the function @xmath65 is the @xmath0 initial momentum distribution .",
    "it has a gaussian form and reflects gluon multiple elastic scatterings on nucleons before their fusion into a @xmath0 in the first stage of the collision @xcite .",
    "the upper limit of the integration over time in ( [ surhg ] ) , namely @xmath66 is the minimal value of @xmath67 and @xmath13 .",
    "the quantity @xmath67 is the average time of the escape of @xmath0 s from the hadron medium for given values of @xmath53 and @xmath0 velocity @xmath68 .",
    "note that the average is taken with the weight    @xmath69    where @xmath70 and @xmath71 is the nuclear matter density distribution .",
    "for the last quantity , the woods - saxon nuclear matter density distribution with parameters from @xcite is taken . in the integration over hadron momentum in ( [ surhg ] ) the threshold for the reaction ( [ psiabs ] )",
    "is included , i.e. @xmath59 equals zero for @xmath72 and is constant elsewhere ( @xmath73 is a charm meson mass , @xmath74 mev ) .",
    "also the usual bose - einstein or fermi - dirac distribution for hadron specie @xmath40 is used in ( [ surhg ] )    @xmath75    as far as @xmath59 is concerned , there are no data for every particular @xmath60 scattering .",
    "therefore , only two types of the cross - section , the first , @xmath76 , for @xmath77 scattering and the second , @xmath78 , for @xmath79 scattering are assumed , here . in the model",
    "presented @xmath76 is put at @xmath80    @xmath81 absorption cross - section . and",
    "values of @xmath80 in the range of 3 - 5 mb are taken from p - a data @xcite .",
    "the @xmath79 cross - section @xmath82 is assumed to be 2/3 of @xmath76 , which is due to the quark counting .    as it has been already suggested",
    "@xcite also @xmath0 scattering in nuclear matter should be included in any @xmath0 absorption model .",
    "this could be done with the introduction of @xmath0 survival factor in nuclear matter @xcite",
    "@xmath83    where @xmath84 is the nuclear matter density and @xmath85 the mean path length of the @xmath0 through the colliding nuclei .",
    "the length @xmath85 is expressed by the following formula @xcite :    @xmath86\\ , \\label{length}\\ ] ]    where @xmath87 .    since @xmath0 absorptions :",
    "in nuclear matter and in the hadron gas , are separate in time , @xmath0 survival factor for a heavy - ion collision with the initial energy density @xmath55 , could be defined as    @xmath88    note that since right sides of ( [ surhg ] ) and ( [ surnm ] ) include parts which depend on impact parameter @xmath53 and the left sides are functions of @xmath55 only , the expression converting the first quantity to the second ( or reverse ) should be given .",
    "this is done with the use of the dependence of @xmath55 on the transverse energy @xmath7 extracted from na50 data @xcite ( for details see @xcite ) .    to make the model as much realistic as possible",
    ", one should keep in mind that only about @xmath89 of @xmath0 s measured are directly produced during collision .",
    "the rest is the result of @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) and @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) decay @xcite .",
    "therefore the realistic @xmath0 survival factor could be expressed as    @xmath94    where @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are given also by formulae ( [ surhg ] ) , ( [ surnm ] ) and ( [ surv ] ) but with @xmath65 , @xmath98 and @xmath63 changed appropriately ( for details see @xcite ) .    to complete , also values of cross - sections for @xmath99 and @xmath100 scatterings are needed . for simplicity",
    ", it is assumed that both these cross - sections are equal to @xmath77 one .",
    "since @xmath0 is smaller than @xmath90 or @xmath92 , this means that @xmath0 suppression evaluated according to ( [ survsum ] ) is _ underestimated _ here .",
    "to calculate formula ( [ surhg ] ) initial values @xmath18 and @xmath19 are needed . for the estimation of the last quantity experimental results for s - s @xcite and au - au @xcite collisions",
    "are explored .",
    "the s - s data give @xmath101 @xmath3 and au - au data @xmath102 @xmath3 .",
    "these values are for central collisions , for more peripheral ones the initial baryon number density should be lower . to simplify numerical calculations ,",
    "@xmath19 is kept constant over the whole range of @xmath53 .",
    "but , to check the possible dependence on @xmath19 , also the much lower value @xmath103 @xmath3 is examined . to find @xmath18 , ( [ energy ] - [ strange ] ) with respect to @xmath104 , @xmath43 and @xmath42 are solved .",
    "then , having put @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 into ( [ entropy ] ) , @xmath18 is obtained .",
    "the last parameter of the model is the freeze - out temperature .",
    "two values @xmath108 mev are taken here and they agree well with estimates based on hadron yields @xcite .          where @xmath110 is the ratio of the @xmath0 to the drell - yan production cross - section in a - b(p - p ) interactions times the branching ratio of the @xmath0 into a muon pair .",
    "the values of the ratio for p - p , s - u and pb - pb are taken from @xcite .",
    "the results of numerical evaluations of ( [ survsum ] ) agree with the data well qualitatively for greater baryonic cross - section @xmath76 and ( or ) for the lower freeze - out temperature @xmath12 , except the last point measured for the highest @xmath7 bin .",
    "now the full ( 3 + 1)-dimensional hydrodynamic evolution ( in the form described in sect .  [ timetable ] ) and @xmath0 absorption in nuclear matter will be taken into account and results are depicted in figs.[fig.4.]-[fig.5 . ] . to draw also s - u data together with pb - pb ones , instead of multiplying @xmath111 by @xmath112 ,   @xmath113",
    "is divided by @xmath112 , i.e. `` the experimental @xmath0 hadron gas survival factor '' is defined as      and values of this factor are drawn in figs.[fig.4.]-[fig.5 .",
    "] as the experimental data .",
    "the quantity @xmath115 is a parameter from the expression for a nucleus radius @xmath116 .",
    "the value of @xmath117 is used to fix the initial position of the rarefaction wave in the evaluation of @xmath118 in ( [ surhg ] ) .",
    "it has turned out that the case of @xmath119 @xmath3 does not differ substantially from that of @xmath120 @xmath3 , so curves for @xmath119 @xmath3 are not depicted in figs.[fig.4.]-[fig.5 . ] .",
    "having compared figs.[fig.4.]-[fig.5 . ] with figs.[fig.2.]-[fig.3 .",
    "] , one can see that adding the transverse expansion changes the final ( theoretical ) pattern of @xmath0 suppression qualitatively .",
    "now the curves for the case including the transverse expansion are not convex , in opposite to the case with the longitudinal expansion only , where the curves are .",
    "as far as the pattern of suppression is concerned , theoretical curves do not fall steep enough at high @xmath55 to cover the data area .",
    "but for some choice of parameters , namely for @xmath76 somewhere between 4 and 5 mb and for @xmath121 fm , a quite satisfactory curve could have been obtained .",
    "precisely , again only the highest @xmath7 bin point falls down of the range of theoretical estimates completely .",
    "but the error bar of this point is very wide . and also",
    "the contradiction in positions of the last three points of the 1998 data can be seen .",
    "this means that the high @xmath7 region should be measured once more with the better accuracy to state definitely whether the abrupt fall of the experimental survival factor takes place or not there .    to support the conclusion , main results from figs.[fig.4.]-[fig.5 .",
    "] are presented in fig.[fig.6 . ] again .",
    "the original data @xcite for @xmath122 and @xmath0 survival factors given by ( [ survsum ] ) multiplied by @xmath123 and now as functions of @xmath7 are depicted there ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath124 inelastic cross - section is the most crucial parameter in the model presented .",
    "so to be sure what is the exact result of @xmath0 absorption , one should know how this cross - section behaves in the hot hadron environment .",
    "the newest estimations of @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 cross - sections at high invariant collision energies @xcite give values of @xmath76 and @xmath78 of the same order as assumed here .",
    "also it should be stressed that the @xmath128 inelastic cross - sections are considered as constant quantities in the model presented .",
    "but , as the results of just mentioned papers suggest , they are not constant at all .",
    "the cross - sections are growing functions of the invariant collision energy @xmath129 .",
    "therefore , one could think naively that the increase of @xmath55 ( or in other words @xmath7 ) causes the increase of the invariant collision energy @xmath129 on the average and further the increase of the @xmath128 inelastic cross - sections . in this way",
    ", the line describing @xmath0 survival factor could be placed close to the solid curve of fig.[fig.6 . ] for low @xmath55 ( @xmath7 ) , and then , as the @xmath128 inelastic cross - sections increase , this line would go closer to the dashed curve of fig.[fig.6 . ] for high @xmath55 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "so , the experimental pattern of @xmath0 suppression could be recovered .",
    "as the last remark , the author would like to call reader s attention to fig.5 of @xcite .",
    "the solid and dotted curves in that figure are exactly the same as curves just presented in fig.[fig.6 . ] .",
    "but the distortion in the qgp is the main reason for @xmath0 suppression in @xcite !",
    "it is also stated there , that results shown `` provide evidence for the production of the quark - gluon plasma in central high - energy pb - pb collisions '' .",
    "therefore , the final conclusion is the following : the na50 pb - pb data provides evidence for the production of the thermalized and _ confined _ hadron gas in the central rapidity region of a pb - pb collision .",
    "this implies that @xmath0 suppression is not a good signal for the quark - gluon plasma appearance at a central heavy - ion collision .",
