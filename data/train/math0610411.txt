    "quasicrystals form an interesting class of solids whose structure determination requires a substantially extended setting in comparison to classical crystallography , see @xcite and references therein . in particular ,",
    "one first has to extract from the diffraction data the higher - dimensional embedding space and an appropriate lattice in it , followed by the reconstruction of the window ( or acceptance domain ) for the description of the atomic positions .    in what follows ,",
    "we begin to analyze the structure of this inverse problem from a mathematical perspective . to this end",
    ", we assume a perfect diffraction experiment and the appropriateness of describing the underlying structure as a model set .",
    "the first step , finding the fourier module and then the resulting cut and project scheme , seems relatively straight - forward .",
    "we thus assume this step already done , see also @xcite and further remarks below for more .",
    "consequently , we need to determine the window to complete the picture . here",
    ", we discuss the question how and to what extent it is specified by the diffraction image .",
    "since all principal aspects show up already for a mono - atomic system , we make this simplifying assumption , too .",
    "we are well aware of the fact that real quasicrystals require the reconstruction of several windows , but this adds a technical complication , not a principal hurdle , to the picture described below .",
    "complementary reconstruction methods on the basis of discrete tomography @xcite look also promising in the context of quasicrystals @xcite , but are not considered here .",
    "a delone set @xmath2 is described by the corresponding dirac comb @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the normalized point ( or dirac ) measure at @xmath5 , see @xcite for details . a perfect diffraction image of @xmath2 , as described by the positive measure @xmath6 , uniquely determines its inverse fourier transform , which is the autocorrelation ( or patterson ) measure @xmath7 .",
    "our starting point is thus the ( hypothetically complete ) knowledge of @xmath7 , where we shall work with infinite point sets @xmath2 to avoid the extra layer of complication from finite apertures .",
    "the remaining task is then to determine a window @xmath1 from this information , which leads to matheron s covariogram problem @xcite .",
    "this is an example of a class of inverse problems where one aims at the reconstruction of a finite or compact set in euclidean space from its ( possibly weighted ) difference set . as originally observed by patterson @xcite for finite point sets in @xmath8 , there need not be a unique solution to the reconstruction problem . to capture this ambiguity ,",
    "two point sets are called _ homometric _ when they share the same ( weighted ) difference set , see @xcite and references therein for further examples .",
    "similar questions emerge for non - empty compact subsets @xmath9 , where the _ covariogram _ @xmath10 encapsulates the difference information , and one tries to determine @xmath11 from the knowledge of @xmath12 , see @xcite .",
    "furthermore , one is also interested in similar concepts for _ infinite _ point sets in general , and delone sets in particular . here",
    ", two delone sets are called _ homometric _ when they share the same autocorrelation measure , to be defined in detail below .",
    "there is an interesting connection between the homometry of delone sets and the covariogram problem for the class of model sets ( also known as cut and project sets ) @xcite , which is explored below .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "the covariogram and its elementary properties are introduced in the next section , while section  [ auto - sec ] recalls the basic facts about the autocorrelation of a regular model set and links it with the covariogram . within a given cut and project scheme",
    ", the homometry problem thus becomes equivalent to matheron s covariogram problem @xcite .",
    "section  [ example ] shows a planar example of two different sets with the same covariogram , which give rise to two distinct homometric model sets .",
    "let @xmath13 be a non - empty compact set which is the closure of its interior , @xmath14 .",
    "the function @xmath15 is called the _ covariogram _ of the set @xmath11 .",
    "this defines a real - valued function on @xmath16 which is inversion symmetric , @xmath17 , and satisfies @xmath18 the function @xmath19 is continuous on @xmath16 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , @xmath12 is a positive definite function with compact support .",
    "the latter is the so - called _ difference body _",
    "@xmath20 which is always inversion symmetric .",
    "in fact , the entire covariogram of @xmath11 equals that of @xmath21 as well as that of any translate @xmath22 .",
    "this means that @xmath12 can determine @xmath11 at best up to translations and inversion . as we shall see below ,",
    "even this is generally not the case .",
    "if @xmath23 denotes the characteristic function of @xmath11 , the function @xmath19 is given by the convolution @xmath24 the fourier transform thus satisfies @xmath25 which is a positive , analytic function that vanishes at @xmath26 .",
    "this relation is the reason why , if @xmath11 is itself inversion symmetric in the sense that @xmath27 for a suitable translation @xmath28 , @xmath23 can be reconstructed from the knowledge of @xmath12 , up to translation and inversion @xcite .",
    "if @xmath11 is a convex polytope in dimension @xmath29 , it is determined by @xmath30 , in the sense mentioned above , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "other examples include convex sets in the plane with @xmath31-smooth boundaries , and large other classes ( e.g. , non-@xmath32 bodies and bodies that are not strictly convex ) , though the general claim is still open , see @xcite .",
    "however , starting with dimension @xmath33 , uniqueness fails even within the class of convex polytopes , compare @xcite . in general , the reconstruction of @xmath11 from the knowledge of @xmath12 is a difficult problem , which is beyond our scope here .",

    "in this section , we use the setting of euclidean spaces for simplicity .",
    "this covers the most common situation in practice ; we refer the reader to @xcite for the more general setting .",

    "the set @xmath39 is a point lattice in @xmath40 such that @xmath37 is @xmath41 between @xmath39 and @xmath42 and that @xmath43 is dense in @xmath36 .",
    "finally , the @xmath44-map is defined on @xmath45 via @xmath46 for all @xmath47 .",
    "it has a unique extension to the rational span @xmath48 of @xmath45 , but not to all of @xmath49 .    to define a ( regular ) model set on the basis of the cut and project scheme , we need to specify a window @xmath50 .",
    "we assume that @xmath1 is a compact set with non - empty interior and the property that @xmath51 .",
    "regularity refers to the extra requirement that the boundary @xmath52 has measure @xmath53 in internal space . in this setting",
    ", we obtain a ( regular ) model set @xmath2 as @xmath54 with any @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",

    "the limit exists by general properties of model sets , compare @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is independent of the translation @xmath28 in , wherefore we set @xmath61 from now on without loss of generality .",
    "it is well known that the autocorrelation has the explicit form @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a uniformly discrete ( and hence countable ) subset of @xmath49 and the autocorrelation coefficient @xmath64 is given by ( * ? ? ?",

    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] this expresses the autocorrelation of @xmath2 in terms of the covariogram of the window @xmath1 , see @xcite for related problems that can be expressed this way .",
    "let us recall that two delone sets are called _ homometric _ when they share the same autocorrelation , see @xcite for an example in the setting of quasicrystals .",
    "note that this definition , due to the infinite volume limit in eq .",
    ", disregards contributions from point sets of density @xmath53 . for simplicity , we restrict ourselves to delone sets with unique autocorrelations here ( meaning independence from the selected averaging van hove sequence , compare @xcite ) . in particular , this is the situation for all model sets .",
    "[ main - thm ] two model sets obtained from the same cut and project scheme are homometric if and only if the defining windows share the same covariogram .",
    "if the two model sets , @xmath2 and @xmath66 , possess the same autocorrelation , the coefficient @xmath64 is valid for both of them . since the cut and project scheme is fixed , the factor @xmath67 in eq .",
    "is the same for @xmath2 and @xmath66 .",
    "consequently , the covariograms of the windows coincide on all points @xmath68 . by the general",
    "setting of a cut and project scheme , @xmath69 is a dense subset of @xmath70 , so that the covariogram , which is a continuous function @xcite , is completely determined on @xmath70 , while it vanishes on the complement . as the same argument applies to @xmath71 ,",
    "the covariograms of @xmath1 and @xmath72 coincide .",
    "the converse claim is obvious from eq .  .",
    "it is a well established result , see @xcite and references therein , that the diffraction measure of a regular model set @xmath2 is a pure point measure , meaning that it is a countable sum of weighted bragg ( or dirac ) peaks .",
    "it is given by @xmath73 , the fourier transform of the autocorrelation measure @xmath74 . since both @xmath74 and @xmath73 are tempered measures , and since fourier transform is invertible on this class of measures , the following consequence is immediate .",
    "homometric model sets from the same cut and project scheme have the same diffraction measure .",
    "conversely , kinematic diffraction can not discriminate between homometric model sets .",
    "so far , the formulation was based upon a fixed cut and project scheme . in general , however , there are different possibilities to generate a given model set .",
    "this also implies that two regular model sets obtained from _ different _ cut and project schemes can still be homometric .",
    "if so , they have the same autocorrelation @xmath75 by definition , and thus the same diffraction measure @xmath76 .",
    "since regular model sets are pure point diffractive @xcite , @xmath76 comprises a countable sum of dirac measures with positive intensity .",
    "the @xmath77-span of their positions is the so - called _",
    "fourier module_. via minimal embedding , it defines an essentially unique cut and project scheme , whose dual in the sense of @xcite is a natural setting to describe both model sets in the same cut and project scheme , see @xcite for details . in this sense , the restriction in theorem  [ main - thm ] is not essential .",
    "a simple example of two distinct homometric polygons was given in @xcite .",
    "they are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] , together with some typical intersection pattern .",
    "the polygons @xmath78 and @xmath79 are polyominoes , which both consist of @xmath80 elementary squares .",
    "their joint covariogram , supported on the inversion symmetric difference body , is sketched in figure  [ fig2 ] as a contour plot .     and @xmath79 .",
    "it is inversion symmetric with respect to the origin , the latter marked by a dot .",
    "the outer polygonal line is the boundary of the difference body , which is the support of the covariogram , see eq .  .",

    "the model set formulation is thus based on a lattice @xmath87 .",
    "its basis matrix reads @xmath88   1 & -1/\\sqrt{2 } & 0 &   1/\\sqrt{2 }   \\\\ 0 & -1/\\sqrt{2 } & 1 & -1/\\sqrt{2 } \\end{array}\\right),\\ ] ] where the columns contain the coordinates of the basis vectors .",
    "the first two rows show the coordinates in direct space , the remaining rows those in internal space . since @xmath89 , the lattice @xmath39 has density @xmath90 . in this setting",
    ", we define the two model sets @xmath91 both windows are placed in internal space such that their lower left corner has coordinates @xmath92 .",
    "this way , the corresponding model sets are generic , meaning that @xmath93 for @xmath94 .",

    "big dots mark points that are common to both , while open circles ( small dots ) are points of @xmath99 ( of @xmath100 ) .",
    "[ fig4],scaledwidth=50.0% ]     ( grey area ) and @xmath79 ( bounded by black line ) . the two white squares on the left ( the two grey ones on the right ) form the window for the points in @xmath99 ( in @xmath100 ) .",
    "[ fig5],width=226 ]    a patch of @xmath96 is shown in figure  [ fig3 ] , while figure  [ fig4 ] displays the difference between the two model sets .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the windows , compare figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "in particular , the difference sets are model sets themselves , with @xmath101 note , however , that the sets @xmath99 and @xmath100 are not homometric .",
    "the lattice dual to @xmath39 is denoted by @xmath102 ( observe the different star ) and is spanned by the basis matrix @xmath103 its projection , @xmath104 , is then the fourier module that carries the bragg peaks .",
    "the diffraction measure @xmath76 is the same for both @xmath96 and @xmath97 , and reads @xcite @xmath105 the intensity function is given by @xmath106 where @xmath94 , with @xmath107 being the same function for both choices .",
    "recall @xmath108 the linearity of fourier transform , and its factorisation over rectangular domains . with @xmath109 ,",
    "one obtains @xmath110 where @xmath111 the diffraction image is shown in figure  [ fig6 ] .     and",
    "a bragg peak at @xmath112 is represented by a disk centred at @xmath112 with an area proportional to the intensity .",
    "note that the image is inversion symmetric , but has no reflection symmetry in a line.[fig6],scaledwidth=62.0% ]",
    "the characterisation of homometric model sets is possible via the window covariogram .",
    "however , the corresponding homometry classes do not consist of model sets only , since one can always add and subtract point sets of density @xmath53 . more interestingly",
    ", there is still the possibility for other sets in these classes that differ from standard model sets in an essential way .",
    "a better understanding of the homometry classes defined by model sets and related structures with pure point diffraction thus requires further investigation .    when considering homometry for systems with mixed spectra , in particular those including diffuse scattering , the situation gets significantly more involved . as an example from @xcite , we mention the binary rudin - shapiro chain in one dimension , which is deterministic , versus the binary bernoulli chain , which is stochastic .",
    "they define a homometric pair of point sets that even differ in entropy , being @xmath53 versus @xmath113 in this example . consequently , new concepts for further progress are required .",
