    "even when the shell becomes gravitationally unstable , it takes some time for the perturbations to grow to induce the fragmentation .",
    "the time - scale for fragmentation can be roughly estimated by @xmath165 .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the growth rate for a fixed wavenumber changes with time because @xmath157 and @xmath154 in equation ( [ eq : grate ] ) are modified by the mass accretion . to evaluate the typical fragmentation scale , we keep track of all the modes that attain the maximum growth rate during the shell history . for those modes , we define the fragmentation time @xmath166 as : @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the time when the mode @xmath152 first becomes unstable .",
    "namely , @xmath166 is the time for the perturbation to grow @xmath33 times the initial value .",

    "in this section , we use the result of the linear analysis to find the conditions for fragmentation of a supernova - driven shell . the dispersion relation ( [ eq : maxrate ] )",
    "is derived with one - zone approximation to the shell , whereas the shell has a stratified structure in our simulations .",
    "the application of the linear analysis to our result is , therefore , not straightforward .",
    "if the stratified structure is maintained until the shell disappears , the gravitational instability seems to occur first in a cold layer of the shell due to its low temperature",
    ". however , this is not the case because the mass of the cooled gas is not sufficient to trigger the gravitational instability . on the contrary , the coldest layer tends to gradually expand as discussed in section [ result2 ] , indicating that the self - gravity is not important there . in reality",
    ", the gravitational instability most easily occurs at the scale comparable to the width of the shell because the column density of the layer must be high enough for fragmentation .",

    "thus , the metallicity dependence disappears for such high ambient densities . in the cases of @xmath176 ,",

    "as long as the mean temperature falls to @xmath180 ",
    "@xmath181 k through h@xmath12 cooling , the total amount of gas swept up into the shell does matter for fragmentation .",
    "thus , the conditions for fragmentation rely heavily on the ambient density as well as explosion energy , but little on the metallicity .    in table [ tab : timef ] , we show the properties of the shell at fragmentation time @xmath166 . there is a range of the fragment mass because some unstable modes fulfill the condition ( [ eq : tfrag ] ) soon after @xmath166 .",
    "this means that the fragmentation scale depends largely on the shape of initial perturbation , or that the shell fragments with a wide range of mass scales .",

    ", low - mass stars can be triggered by the first supernova .",
    "we assume that h@xmath12 molecules in the ambient medium are completely photo - dissociated by the central star before the supernova , but they are replenished quickly due to a high fraction of the catalyst electrons in our calculations . as a result , the ambient temperature decreases to several hundreds of kelvins owing to the h@xmath12 cooling ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "however , we have not considered the effects of any external radiation .",

    "the low temperature in the ambient medium prolongs the lifetime of the shell .",
    "the fragmentation time is slightly shorter than the shell lifetime even in our calculation , and thus the fragmentation may not occur with external heating .",
    "according to a cosmological simulation by johnson , greif & bromm ( 2008 ) , the photo - dissociating radiation flux is @xmath239 at @xmath240 ev in units of @xmath241 erg s@xmath242 @xmath243 hz@xmath242 sr@xmath242 . for this background ,",

    "hence , the external photo - dissociating flux does not prevent the h@xmath12 formation at this phase .",
    "soon after that , the h@xmath12 column density of the shell rapidly increases to shield the photo - dissociation ( i.e. , @xmath246 @xmath243 ; e.g. , draine & beltoldi 1996 ) as seen below . before the photo - dissociation",

    "for instance , the decelerating shock instability is expected to grow from the linear analysis ( vishniac 1983 ) .",
    "mac low & norman ( 1993 ) numerically demonstrated , however , that this instability saturates at a rather low amplitude in the non - linear stage , and does not significantly disturb the shell structure .",
    "the thermal instability is also expected to occur in the rapid cooling phase in the shocked layer .",
    "koyama & inutsuka ( 2002 ) studied propagation of a shock into the contemporary ism and fragmentation of a shock - compressed layer , taking account of cooling , heating , and thermal conduction .",
    "they showed that the thermal instability causes the cooled layer to fragment into small ( @xmath254 @xmath4 ",
    "@xmath42 au ) cloudlets with some translational motions .",
    "bromm , yoshida & hernquist ( 2003 ) simulated the first supernova explosions , and showed that the swept - up shell consists of small cloudlets , which are presumably formed by thermal instability .",
    "the motions of the cloudlets effectively enhance the sound speed within the shell , leading to delay in growth of the gravitational instability .",
    "after the shell fragments through the gravitational instability , the cloudlets will aggregate into a larger cloud with the contraction of the fragments .",
    "this may ultimately lead to cluster star formation ( elmegreen 1998 ) .",
    "thus , thermal instability influences not only the shell fragmentation but also the subsequent star formation in the fragments .",
    "although our one - dimensional calculations can not clarify the detailed fragmentation processes in the shell and subsequent evolution of the fragments , future multi - dimensional simulations are expected to reveal them .",
    "to explore the possibility of star formation triggered by supernovae in the early universe , we have studied the evolution of shells formed around the supernova bubble during the snowplough phase in low - metallicity environments .",
    "we investigated detailed structure of the shell , using spherical symmetric hydrodynamics with non - equilibrium chemistry for different sets of ambient densities , explosion energies , and metallicities .",
    "our results are summarized as follows :    * we have demarcated the ranges of metallicity in terms of thermal evolution of the shell : * * for metallicities with @xmath255 , the post - shock gas first cools promptly to @xmath134 k through the h@xmath12 cooling , and then progressively to a lower value through adiabatic expansion . although @xmath4 % of the deuterium transforms into hd in the shell , the hd cooling and heating have never become important because of decreasing density . * * for higher metallicities ( @xmath256 ) , the fine - structure line transitions of o and c reduce the post - shock gas below @xmath42 k. after the radiative cooling becomes inefficient , the gas then adiabatically expands as in the lower - metallicity cases .",
    "the cmb heating via the ci fine - structure transitions hinders the gas from cooling below the cmb temperature .",
    "* we have examined whether the swept - up shell becomes gravitationally unstable before it mixes with the ism , using the linear perturbation analysis .",
    "fragmentation of the shell easily occurs in denser ism and for higher explosion energies because these conditions are favourable to attaining the column density of the shell necessary for fragmentation .",
    "the criteria for the fragmentation depend little on metallicity as thermal evolution of the shell is not so sensitive to it .",
    "* we have evaluated the fragment mass from the wavelength of the maximum growth modes .",
    "because the wavelength is inversely proportional to the column density , the fragment mass becomes lower for both higher ambient densities and higher explosion energies .",
    "the resulting fragment mass is @xmath218",
    " @xmath96 m@xmath8 .",
    "* we have derived the critical halo mass @xmath257 above which star formation can be triggered by a supernova explosion . in minihaloes ( @xmath258 ) where the first stars are more likely to form , this triggering mechanism does not work .",
