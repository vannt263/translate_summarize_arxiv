    "finally , fine structures in the optical spectrum were used to determine the mechanism of superconductivity in the cuprates@xcite .    in the recently discovered feas superconductors@xcite ,",
    "the interplay of collective magnetic degrees of freedom and superconductivity has attracted great interest , in particular given the strong evidence for an electronic pairing mechanism with @xmath28-pairing state@xcite . in this state , the superconducting order parameter has opposite signs in different sheets of the fermi surface separated by the magnetic ordering vector @xmath29 . in distinction , in the conventional @xmath30-pairing state , that is expected to originate from electron - phonon coupling , the superconducting order parameter has the same sign everywhere .",
    "the recent observations of the magnetic resonance mode@xcite , of the microscopic coexistence between magnetic and superconducting order@xcite , and , in particular , of the integer and half - integer flux - quantum transitions in a niobium - iron pnictide loop@xcite give strong evidence for @xmath28-pairing .",
    "important insights about the magnetic , superconducting and normal states have also been obtained in measurements of @xmath4@xcite .",
    "an analysis based on eq.([imsig ] ) and on the ferrell - glover - tinkham ( fgt ) sum rule@xcite ( see eq.([fgt ] ) below ) led to results for the penetration depth@xcite that are consistent with the values obtained by other techniques ( see , for example ref.@xcite ) .",
    "for instance , in @xmath31 , which has @xmath32 , the authors of ref.@xcite found @xmath33 at @xmath34 a typical value for the largest superconducting gap in the same compound was estimated@xcite as @xmath0 @xmath35 .",

    ", a fraction @xmath37 of the total spectral weight of the antiferromagnetic phase is transferred to a finite drude peak , while another fraction @xmath38 stays at energies above the new optical gap @xmath39 .",
    "thus , a system without free carriers in the normal state acquires zero frequency spectral weight through transfer of weight over energies larger than @xmath1 . ]    in the parent compounds @xmath40 and @xmath41 , which do not show superconductivity , long range antiferromagnetic order below the nel temperature @xmath42 leads to the formation of a mid - infrared ( mir ) peak@xcite , with spectral weight being transferred to @xmath43 due to the opening of a spin density wave gap .",
    "here @xmath44 is the single - particle gap for momentum states that are bragg scattered by the magnetic ordering vector ( see figure [ fig_band_structure ] ) . for @xmath40 , @xmath45 ( i.e. @xmath46 ) , yielding @xmath47 , which is not unrealistic for itinerant antiferromagnets . for @xmath48 , the low energy optical response of the parent compounds",
    "is characterized by the drude form , eq.([drude ] ) , however with a significantly reduced plasma frequency @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the plasma frequency above @xmath42@xcite .",
    "finally , systematic investigations of @xmath7 in @xmath51 as function of temperature and carrier concentration were performed in refs.@xcite . upon doping",
    ", the mir peak gets weaker , consistent with the decrease of the ordered magnetic moment @xmath52 with doping@xcite . indeed , assuming @xmath53 and using the results from ref.@xcite for the doping dependence of @xmath54 , one finds for doping concentrations where @xmath55 that @xmath56 , strongly supporting the view that the same electrons that undergo cooper pairing form the ordered moment .",
    "this is consistent with the recent analysis@xcite of the phase diagram of @xmath51 : neutron scattering experiments showed that magnetism and superconductivity compete strongly , to the extent that the staggered moment is suppressed@xcite below @xmath27 and the magnetic phase boundary @xmath57 is bent back towards smaller @xmath58-values for @xmath59 .",
    "theoretical arguments then demonstrate that this coexistence is only possible for an @xmath28-pairing state .",
    "the optical properties in the regime of simultaneous magnetic and superconducting order are promising as they might reveal important information about the interplay between the superfluid condensate , the normal state drude peak and the mir peak .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the optical conductivity in the magnetically ordered phase as well as in the regime of simultaneous magnetic and superconducting order . using parameters suitable to the description of the phase diagram@xcite of @xmath51",
    ", we numerically obtain the optical spectrum below @xmath42 . due to the partial gapping of the fermi surface in the itinerant antiferromagnetic state",
    ", we obtain a drude peak in addition to a mir peak at @xmath43 , in qualitative agreement with the experimental data .",
    "thus , our results give further strong evidence for the itinerant character of the magnetically ordered state .",
    "as shown by nuclear magnetic resonance and muon spin rotation experiments@xcite , antiferromagnetism and superconductivity coexist homogeneously in @xmath51 for the doping range @xmath60 .",
    "recent tunnel diode resonator measurements showed that , in this regime , the @xmath61 superfluid density is reduced when compared to its value in the pure superconducting state@xcite .",
    "one might expect , at first glance , that such a reduction is due to the suppressed plasma frequency below @xmath42 , and the inverse squared penetration depth @xmath62 is given by the reduced value @xmath63 .",
    "in contrast to this expectation , we find that the superfluid condensate of a superconductor with magnetic long range order , while reduced compared to the case without magnetic order , has @xmath62 values that are significantly larger than @xmath63 . in particular , we find a sizable condensate fraction even in the limit where @xmath64 . by analytically investigating the simple but relevant limit of particle - hole symmetry ,",
    "we demonstrate that , in the magnetically ordered superconducting state , spectral weight with energies @xmath43 is transferred from the mir - peak into the singular @xmath65 term of @xmath7 , enhancing @xmath66 ( see figure [ fig_transfer ] ) .",
    "this spectral weight is transferred from regions of the spectrum that can easily be larger than @xmath1 , reflecting the fact that the rigidity of the superconducting ground state with respect to transverse current fluctuations , while smaller than in the paramagnet , is still larger than what the low frequency drude weight would suggest .",
    "our results show that the superfluid density in a magnetic superconductor is not only related to the remaining electronic states of the magnetically reconstructed fermi surface at @xmath61 , but also to the transfer of spectral weight around the mir peak .",
    "these conclusions are consistent with recent theoretical investigations from vorontsov _ _ et al.__@xcite showing that superconductivity is able to coexist with magnetism even when the reconstructed fermi surface at @xmath61 is completely gapped .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we review the basic properties of the optical spectrum of classic superconductors . in section",
    "iii we present our results for the optical conductivity in the magnetically ordered phase of the iron arsenides .",
    "section iv is devoted to the investigation of the optical spectrum of the coexistence state and its relationship to the superfluid density .",
    "section v brings our conclusions and in appendix a we present an explicit calculation of the penetration depth using an alternative approach .",
    "within the kubo formalism the longitudinal optical conductivity is given by @xmath67 with longitudinal current - current correlation function @xmath68_{-}\\right\\rangle dt.\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the @xmath70-th component of the current operator .",
    "for the real part of the optical conductivity , we have : @xmath71 with the regular contribution @xmath72 , that does not contain a @xmath65 contribution . from eq.([kubo ] ) , it follows that the drude weight @xmath73 of the optical conductivity is given by @xmath74 while the regular contribution is @xmath75    the current - current correlation function also determines the london penetration depth via@xmath76 i.e. we consider the static current response at small but finite momentum , in distinction to the weight @xmath73 that measures the homogeneous ( @xmath77 ) response at small @xmath78 . in general",
    ", the order of the limits @xmath77 , @xmath8 versus @xmath79 , @xmath80 , matters and yields different results . yet , in the case of a system with gapped excitation spectrum",
    ", it was shown in ref.@xcite that the order in which these limits are taken is irrelevant .",
    "thus , in the case of a fully gapped superconductor , it follows generally that the drude weight in the superconductor@xmath81 @xmath82 is determined by the penetration depth and thus by the superfluid condensate @xmath83    formally , a contribution @xmath84 in eq.([resig ] ) is not a proof for superconductivity and may occur in a metallic system that is unable to relax its momentum .",
    "then , the metal becomes a perfect conductor , where charges are freely accelerated by an external electric field .",
    "however , in a realistic system one always expects scattering events that allow for momentum relaxation . in case of a perfect conductor ,",
    "such events broaden the singular drude peak e.g. @xmath85 with scattering time @xmath13 .",
    "thus , formally , @xmath86 and the drude response becomes part of the regular contribution to the conductivity @xmath87 .",
    "this is different for a superconductor , where scattering events may cause a reduction of the value of @xmath73 in eq.([resig ] ) but do not change the @xmath65-form of the zero frequency contribution . the meissner effect requires@xmath81that @xmath88 .",
    "together with the fact that the order of limits does not matter for a gapped system@xcite , follows @xmath89 , i.e. the @xmath65-form is robust .",
    "this preservation of the singular @xmath79 response is a consequence of the unique rigidity of the superconductor with respect to transverse current fluctuations .",
    "formally , this rigidity of the superconducting ground state is reflected by the smallness of @xmath90 compared to @xmath91 .",
    "a quantitative determination of the penetration depth in a superconductor can be performed by analyzing the spectral weight transfer in @xmath4 , and is expressed by the ferrell - glover - tinkham ( fgt ) sum rule@xcite : @xmath92    this sum rule relates @xmath2 to the change of total spectral weight between the normal state ( @xmath93 ) and the superconducting ( @xmath94 ) state for @xmath95 .",
    "it follows from the @xmath25-sum rule , eq .",
    "( [ fsum ] ) , and the emergence of the @xmath96-term only below @xmath27 .",
    "thus , upon entering the superconducting state , spectral weight is transferred from finite frequencies to the @xmath10-function at @xmath79 .",
    "we mention that for eq.([fgt ] ) to hold , one assumes that the expectation value of the optical mass @xmath14 , i.e. the value of @xmath12 , is unaffected by the onset of superconductivity . in the feas superconductors , this seems to be the case@xcite , in distinction to the evidence for violation of the fgt sum rule in cuprate superconductors@xcite .",
    "to develop a microscopic model of the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism , we use a few basic ingredients to describe the main features of the iron arsenides@xcite : the electronic structure is characterized by two sets of fermi surface sheets , a circular hole pocket around the center of the brillouin zone and an elliptical electron pocket shifted by the magnetic ordering vector @xmath29 . the non - interacting part @xmath97 of the hamiltonian",
    "is then given by     from the circular hole pocket ( red circle ) .",

    "in conclusion , we analyzed the optical conductivity of both an itinerant antiferromagnetic state and a magnetically ordered superconductor . for the pure magnetic phase , using the parameters associated to the phase diagram@xcite of @xmath51",
    ", we were able to identify the main features observed in the experimental optical spectrum@xcite .",
    "in particular , for the undoped compound , we found a reduced drude peak associated to the remaining reconstructed parts of the fermi surface , as well as a mid - infrared ( mir ) peak at @xmath209 mev , associated to the gap opened at momentum @xmath210 that are bragg scattered by the magnetic ordering vector @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath211 . upon doping ,",
    "the spin density wave gap is reduced and , consequently , the mir peak becomes weaker and more masked by the drude peak .",
    "the experimentally observed optical conductivity has other particular features that are not contemplated by our two - band based model , such as high - frequency interband transitions , a seemingly doping - independent incoherent contribution with a rather long tail , other possible low - weight drude - like peaks at finite frequencies@xcite and , of course , the origin of the scattering processes that lead to a finite lifetime @xmath13 .",
    "clearly , a detailed description of the optical spectrum has to take into account the effects of the other bands that do not participate in the spin density wave state@xcite , and possibly the role played by different orbitals that cross the fermi level . yet ,",
    "our simplified model that provides a very satisfactory description@xcite of the phase diagram of @xmath51 , is able to correctly capture not only the main qualitative features of the spectrum , but also the order of magnitude of the frequency associated to the mir peak .",
    "most interestingly , our results clarify how spectral weight is transferred in magnetic superconductors below the superconducting transition temperature , even in case where the fermi surface of the ordered magnet is fully gapped . in classical superconductors ,",
    "only the spectral weight below the optical gap @xmath212 is transferred to the drude peak . however , in the case where itinerant magnetism is also present and particle - hole symmetry holds , the optical gap is given by @xmath39 , involving energies that can potentially be much larger than the superconducting gap .",
    "thus , in the regime where magnetism and superconductivity coexist in the iron arsenides , the remaining drude peak of the antiferromagnetic phase , whose plasma frequency can be significantly smaller than the plasma frequency of the paramagnetic state , is not the only origin for the value of the superfluid condensate . instead",
    ", spectral weight associated to the higher - frequency mir peak is transferred to the @xmath10-function at @xmath79 , enhancing the superfluid condensate . yet , this superfluid density is always smaller than its value in the non - magnetic superconducting phase , in agreement with experiments@xcite .    this transfer of optical spectral weight is a consequence of the unique rigidity of the superconductor with respect to transverse current fluctuations .",
    "it implies that , even in the limit where the pure @xmath61 antiferromagnetic phase has no drude peak , it is still possible to obtain a finite superfluid density below @xmath27 .",
    "the superfluid density of the coexistence state is not only associated to electronic states from the remaining fermi surface , what allows the superconducting transition to take place even when a fermi surface would not be present in the magnetically ordered state .",
    "this non - trivial observation is corroborated by recent calculations of vorontsov _ _ et al.__@xcite , that found coexisting itinerant magnetism and @xmath28 superconductivity in cases where the reconstructed fermi surface would be completely gapped at @xmath61 . as they pointed out , in these situations",
    "both the antiferromagnetic and superconducting phases are `` effectively attractive '' and cooperate to form the coexistence state .",
