    "several applications treated by discontinuous galerkin finite element methods ( dgfem ) lead to numerical schemes that are stable in @xmath1-type norms .",

    "it is typical for the condition number of the discrete problems to be of order @xmath7 , where @xmath4 is the mesh size and @xmath6 is the polynomial degree . the purpose of this work is to analyse a class of domain decomposition preconditioners and show that they lead to efficient solvers for these challenging problems .    overlapping and nonoverlapping domain decomposition methods",
    "have been successfully developed for a range of applications of dgfem by many authors @xcite . in order to solve a problem on a fine mesh @xmath8",
    ", these methods combine a coarse space solver , defined on a coarse mesh @xmath9 , with local fine mesh solvers , defined on a subdomain decomposition @xmath10 of the domain @xmath11 .",
    "the discontinuous nature of the finite element space leads to a significant flexibility in the choice of the decomposition @xmath10 , which can either be overlapping or nonoverlapping .",
    "as explained in the above references , these methods possess many advantages in terms of simplicity and applicability , as they allow very general choices of basis functions , nonmatching meshes and varying element shapes , and are naturally suited for parallelization . in particular , it has been pointed out by various authors , such as lasser and toselli in @xcite , that the nonoverlapping methods feature reduced inter - subdomain communication burdens , thus representing a key advantage for scalability in parallel computations .",
    "it is of practical interest for applications to determine the influence of the parameters of the preconditioner on the spectral bounds . for problems involving @xmath12-type norms , such as interior penalty methods for diffusion problems ,",
    "nonoverlapping additive schwarz preconditioners for @xmath4-version methods @xcite lead to condition numbers of order @xmath13 , and overlapping methods lead to a condition number of order @xmath14 , where @xmath3 is the coarse mesh size , and @xmath15 is the size of the overlap of the subdomains .",
    "antonietti and houston considered the case of nonoverlapping methods for @xmath0-version dgfem in @xcite , and they showed a bound of order @xmath16 .",

    "it is sufficient to consider low - order projection operators from the fine space to the coarse space ; for example , coarse element mean - value projections are employed in @xcite and local first - order elliptic projections are used in @xcite .",
    "however , low - order projections lead to suboptimal bounds for the condition number in the case of @xmath0-version dgfem .",
    "therefore , a key contribution of this work is an original high - order approximation result between coarse and fine spaces that is of optimal order in the coarse mesh size and polynomial degree ; this result thus represents the main ingredient for the sharp analysis of the condition number bounds .",

    "it can be interpreted as a precise form of the statement that the norm @xmath24 renders @xmath21 close to @xmath31 .",
