    "the idea of an inflationary universe  @xcite is very attractive since it can solve serious problems in standard big bang cosmology such as the horizon and flatness problems  @xcite .",
    "though many types of inflation models have been proposed  @xcite , there are basically three viable models : chaotic  @xcite , new  @xcite , and hybrid inflation  @xcite .",
    "these three models have their own characters .",
    "the chaotic inflation model is difficult to realize in the framework of supergravity since it requires a classical value of the inflaton field larger than the gravitational scale ( @xmath4 gev and it is taken to be unity throughout this paper ) . in supergravity",
    "the reheating temperature of inflation should be low enough to avoid overproduction of gravitinos  @xcite .",
    "the new inflation model  @xcite generally predicts a very low reheating temperature and hence it is the most attractive among the many inflation models .",
    "however , new inflation suffers from a fine - tuning problem about the initial condition ; i.e. , for successful new inflation , the initial value of the inflaton should be very close to the local maximum of the potential in a large region whose size is much longer than the horizon of the universe . on the other hand , hybrid inflation ( and also the chaotic one ) can occur for a large range of initial values .",
    "recently a framework of double inflation was proposed as a way to solve the initial value problem of the new inflation model  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the above serious problem is solved by supergravity effects if there existed preinflation ( e.g. , hybrid inflation ) with a sufficiently large hubble parameter before new inflation  @xcite .",
    "different models of double inflation were studied by various authors  @xcite . unlike other double inflation scenarios , however , our double inflation is quite natural when we try to solve both the gravitino problem and the initial condition problem in the new inflation model .    in this double inflation model ,",
    "if the @xmath1-fold number of the new inflation model is smaller than @xmath2 , density fluctuations produced by both inflations are cosmologically relevant ( the total @xmath1-fold number @xmath2 is required to solve flatness and horizon problems in standard big bang cosmology  @xcite ) . in this case , the preinflation should account for the density fluctuations on large cosmological scales [ including the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) scales ] , while the new inflation model produces density fluctuations on smaller scales .",
    "although the amplitude of the fluctuations on large scales should be normalized to the cobe data  @xcite , fluctuations on small scales are free from the cobe normalization and can have arbitrary power matched to the observation . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the production of primordial black hole massive compact halo objects was considered in this double inflation model . in particular in ref .",
    "@xcite , the coherent oscillation of the inflaton after a preinflation was taken into account .    in this paper",
    ", we study the cosmological implication of the double inflation model which induces a break on the cosmological ( @xmath5mpc ) scale in the initial density perturbations .",
    "it is well known that the observations of galaxy distributions can not be accounted for with the cosmological density parameter @xmath3 and the hubble parameter @xmath6kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 in a standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) model . however , in a double inflation case , there would be a possibility that the observations may be fit with @xmath3 and without a cosmological constant ,  ) . however , there are some papers which point out the problems of interpreting those observations  @xcite . ] since the produced density fluctuations would have a nontrivial shape .",
    "rather we have a chance to determine parameters of double inflation by observations of the large scale structure of the universe . taking hybrid inflation in supergravity  @xcite as an example of the preinflation",
    ", we find that the produced density fluctuations may account for the observed clusters abundances  @xcite and galaxy distributions  @xcite with @xmath8 and @xmath6kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 .",
    "we adopt the double inflation model proposed in refs.@xcite .",
    "the model consists of two inflationary stages ; the first one is called preinflation and we adopt hybrid inflation  @xcite as the preinflation .",
    "we also assume that the second inflationary stage is realized by a new inflation model  @xcite and its @xmath1-fold number is smaller than @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the density fluctuations on large scales are produced during the preinflation and their amplitude should be normalized to the cobe data  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the new inflation model produces fluctuations on small scales .",
    "since the amplitude of the small scale fluctuations is free from the cobe normalization , we expect that the new inflation model can produce density fluctuations appropriate for the observations .",
    "first , let us discuss the hybrid inflation model which we adopt to cause the preinflation .",
    "the hybrid inflation model contains two kinds of superfields : one is @xmath9 and the others are @xmath10 and @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 is the grassmann number denoting superspace .",
    "the model is based on the u@xmath13 symmetry under which @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the superpotential is given by  @xcite @xmath16 the @xmath17-invariant khler potential is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a constant of order @xmath20 and the ellipsis denotes higher - order terms , which we neglect in the present analysis .",
    "we gauge the u@xmath21 phase rotation:@xmath22 and @xmath23 . to satisfy the @xmath24-term flatness condition",
    "we take always @xmath25 in our analysis .    as is shown in ref.@xcite the real part of @xmath26 is identified with the inflaton field @xmath27 .",
    "the potential is minimized at @xmath28 for @xmath29 larger than @xmath30 and inflation occurs for @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    in a region of relatively small",
    "@xmath29 ( @xmath33 ) radiative corrections are important for the inflation dynamics as shown in ref .  @xcite .",
    "including one - loop corrections , the potential for the inflaton @xmath29 is given by @xmath34 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is a renormalization scale .",
    "the hubble parameter @xmath36 and @xmath1-fold number @xmath37 are given by @xmath38 and @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the value of the inflaton field @xmath29 corresponding to an @xmath1-fold number @xmath37 .",
    "if we define @xmath41 as the @xmath1-fold number corresponding to the cobe scale , the cobe normalization leads to a condition for the inflaton potential : @xmath42 where @xmath43 . in a hybrid inflation model , density fluctuation is almost scale free , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a spectral index for a power spectrum of density fluctuations .",
    "now , we consider a new inflation model .",
    "we adopt the new inflation model proposed in ref .",
    "the inflaton superfield @xmath46 is assumed to have an @xmath17 charge @xmath47 and u@xmath48 is dynamically broken down to a discrete @xmath49 at a scale @xmath50 , which generates an effective superpotential  @xcite : @xmath51 the @xmath17-invariant effective khler potential is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a constant of order @xmath20 .",
    "the effective potential @xmath54 for a scalar component of the superfield @xmath55 in supergravity is obtained from the above superpotential ( [ sup - pot2 ] ) and the khler potential ( [ new - kpot ] ) as @xmath56 with @xmath57 this potential yields a vacuum @xmath58 in the true vacuum we have negative energy as @xmath59 the negative vacuum energy ( [ vacuum ] ) is assumed to be canceled out by a supersymmetry- ( susy)-breaking effect  @xcite which gives a positive contribution @xmath60 to the vacuum energy .",
    "thus , we have a relation between @xmath50 and the gravitino mass @xmath61 : @xmath62 the inflaton @xmath63 has a mass @xmath64 in the vacuum with ( for details , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath65 the inflaton @xmath63 may decay into ordinary particles through gravitationally suppressed interactions , which yields reheating temperature @xmath66 given by is discussed in ref.@xcite ] @xmath67 if we take @xmath68 and @xmath69 , @xmath70 in this case , the reheating temperature @xmath66 is as low as @xmath71  gev - @xmath72  gev for @xmath73 ( @xmath74  tev ) , for example , which is low enough to solve the gravitino problem .",
    "let us discuss dynamics of the new inflation model . identifying the inflaton field @xmath75",
    "with the real part of the field @xmath76 , we obtain a potential of the inflaton for @xmath77 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : new - pot ] ) : @xmath78 it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the slow - roll condition for the inflation is satisfied for @xmath79 and @xmath80 where @xmath81 new inflation ends when @xmath82 becomes larger than @xmath83 .",
    "the hubble parameter of the new inflation model is given by @xmath84 the @xmath1-fold number @xmath85 is given by @xmath86 the amplitude of primordial density fluctuations @xmath87 due to the new inflation model is written as @xmath88 notice here that we have larger density fluctuations for smaller @xmath89 and hence the largest amplitude of the fluctuations is given at the beginning of new inflation . an interesting point on the above density fluctuations",
    "is that it results in a tilted spectrum with spectral index @xmath90 given by ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath91      the crucial point observed in ref .",
    "@xcite is that preinflation sets dynamically the initial condition for new inflation .",
    "the inflaton field @xmath92 for new inflation gets an effective mass @xmath93 from the @xmath94 $ ] term in the potential ( [ sugra - general - potential ] ) during preinflation  @xcite .",
    "thus , we write the effective mass @xmath95 as @xmath96 where we introduce a free parameter @xmath97 since the precise value of the effective mass depends on the details of the khler potential . for example , if the khler potential contains @xmath98 , the effective mass is equal to @xmath99 .",
    "the evolution of the inflaton @xmath82 for the new inflation model is described as @xmath100 using @xmath101 , we get a solution to the above equation as @xmath102 where @xmath103 denotes the scale factor of the universe .",
    "thus , for @xmath104 , @xmath82 oscillates during the preinflation and its amplitude decreases as @xmath105 . thus , at the end of preinflation the @xmath82 takes a value @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the value of @xmath82 at the beginning of preinflation , @xmath108 is the value of @xmath82 at which the potential has a minimum , and @xmath109 is the total @xmath1-fold number of preinflation .",
    "the @xmath108 deviates from zero through the effect of the @xmath110 term and the potential has a minimum  @xcite at @xmath111 thus , at the end of preinflation the @xmath82 settles down to this @xmath108 .",
    "after preinflation , the @xmath29 and @xmath112 start to oscillate and the universe becomes matter dominated .",
    "@xmath113 and @xmath114 couple to the u@xmath21 gauge multiplets and decay immediately to gauge fields if energetically allowed .",
    "we assume that masses for the gauge fields are larger than those of @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "we also assume that the supersymmetric ( susy ) standard model particles do not couple to the gauge multiplets .",
    "thus , @xmath115 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 decay into light particles only through gravitationally suppressed interactions and the coherent oscillations of @xmath115 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 fields continue until new inflation starts . in this period of the coherent oscillations",
    "the average potential energy of the scalar fields is the half of the total energy of the universe and hence the effective mass of @xmath82 is given by @xmath116 here and hereafter , we take @xmath117 . the evolution of @xmath82 is described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : osc - pre ] ) . taking into account @xmath118",
    ", one can find that the amplitude of @xmath82 decreases as @xmath119 .",
    "after the preinflation ends , the superpotential for the inflaton of the preinflation vanishes and hence the potential for @xmath82 has a minimum at @xmath120 .    during the matter - dominated era between two inflations , the energy density scales as @xmath121 , and it is @xmath122 and @xmath123 for a hybrid inflation and a new inflation , respectively , the scale factor increases by a factor @xmath124 during this era .",
    "thus , the mean initial value @xmath125 of @xmath82 at the beginning of new inflation is written as begins oscillating just after the preinflation , the time derivative of it vanishes . ]",
    "@xmath126.\\ ] ] we now discuss quantum effects during preinflation .",
    "it is known that in a de sitter universe massless fields have quantum fluctuations whose amplitudes are given by @xmath127 . however , the quantum fluctuations for @xmath82 are strongly suppressed  @xcite in the present model since the mass of @xmath82 is larger than the hubble parameter until the start of new inflation .",
    "let us consider the amplitude of fluctuations with comoving wave number @xmath128 corresponding to the horizon scale at the beginning of new inflation . these fluctuations are induced during preinflation and its amplitude at horizon crossing [ @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is a time of horizon crossing ] is given by @xmath131",
    ". is greater than @xmath132 . ]",
    "since those fluctuations reenter the horizon at the beginning of new inflation ( @xmath133 ) , the scale factor of the universe increases from @xmath134 to @xmath135 by a factor of @xmath136 . as we have seen above",
    ", the amplitude of fluctuations decreases as @xmath105 during preinflation and @xmath119 during the matter - dominated era between two inflations .",
    "since the scale factor increases by @xmath124 during the matter - dominated era and by @xmath137 from @xmath130 to @xmath135 , respectively , it increases by @xmath138 from @xmath130 to the beginning of the matter - dominated era .",
    "therefore , the amplitude of fluctuations with comoving wavelength corresponding to the horizon scale at the beginning of new inflation is now given by @xmath139^{-3/2 } \\left [      \\left ( \\frac{\\mu}{v } \\right)^{4/3 } \\right]^{-3/4 } %    \\simeq \\frac{h_{\\rm pre}}{3^{1/4}2\\pi }       \\left(\\frac{v}{\\mu}\\right)^{2}.    \\label{eq : q - fluctuation}\\ ] ] the fluctuations given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : q - fluctuation ] ) are a little less than newly induced fluctuations at the beginning of new inflation [ @xmath140 ) ] .",
    "moreover , the fluctuations produced during preinflation are more suppressed for smaller wavelength .",
    "thus , we assume that the fluctuations of @xmath82 induced in preinflation can be neglected when we estimate the fluctuations during new inflation .    here",
    "let us estimate the @xmath1-fold number which corresponds to our current horizon . from eq.([reheat - temp ] ) , the reheating temperature after new inflation is given as @xmath141 here and hereafter we take @xmath68 and @xmath69 for simplicity .",
    "the @xmath1-fold number is given by  @xcite @xmath142 where @xmath143 is a potential energy when a given scale @xmath144 leaves the horizon , @xmath145 is when the inflation ends , and @xmath146 is the energy density at the time of reheating .",
    "now we can take @xmath147 , and @xmath148 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath149 ( i.e. , present horizon scale ) , @xmath150 since preinflation lasts after the scale @xmath151 crosses the horizon by an @xmath1-folding number @xmath152 as mentioned above , the @xmath1-folding number corresponding to the cobe scale can be expressed as @xmath153 when we consider cobe normalization , eq .",
    "( [ eq : cobe - cond ] ) , we have to use this quantity .",
    "finally , we make a comment on the domain - wall problem in the double inflation model .",
    "since the potential of the inflaton @xmath63 has a discrete symmetry [ see eqs .",
    "( [ sup - pot2 ] ) and ( [ new - kpot ] ) ] , domain walls are produced if the phases of @xmath63 are spatially random .",
    "however , preinflation makes the phase of @xmath63 homogeneous with the help of the interactions between two inflaton fields @xmath115 and @xmath63 [ see eq .",
    "( [ deviation ] ) ] .",
    "therefore , the domain - wall problem does not exist in the present model .",
    "we estimate density fluctuations in the double inflation model numerically by calculating the evolution of @xmath82 and @xmath29 . for simplicity , we take @xmath154 .    since we are concerned with the situation where the breaking ( transit scale from the hybrid inflation to the new inflation ) occurs at cosmological scale , we choose a parameter region in which the breaking scale comes within the range @xmath155 where @xmath156kms@xmath7mpc@xmath157 and it takes @xmath158 in this paper .",
    "also , we require that the ratio between the density fluctuation produced by a hybrid inflation and that by new inflation is @xmath159 where @xmath160 and @xmath161 refer to the amplitude of a power spectrum of density fluctuations at @xmath151 , produced by new inflation and preinflation , respectively :    @xmath162    where @xmath163 is a cdm transfer function .",
    "we draw a sample of results in fig.[fig : inflation_sample ] for @xmath164 . from this figure",
    "we can see that if @xmath165 @xmath151 is at a cosmological scale , and density fluctuations produced during new inflation are not too far from that of preinflation .",
    "we can understand the qualitative dependence of @xmath166 on @xmath167 as follows : when @xmath53 is large , the slope of the potential for new inflation is too steep , and new inflation can not last for a long time .",
    "therefore , the break occurs at smaller scales . as for @xmath168",
    ", we can see that the larger @xmath169 is , the larger @xmath170 is , from eq.([eq : cobe - cond ] ) .",
    "in addition , from eqs.([eq : new - density ] ) and ( [ eq : init - new - inflaton ] ) , we can see that @xmath171 for a fixed @xmath50 .",

    "in this section we compare the result of our double inflation model with the observations of the cluster abundances  @xcite and galaxy distributions  @xcite .",
    "since the power spectrum of density fluctuations shows a break on the cosmological scale in this double inflation model , we can not simply employ the value of @xmath172 quoted by previous works  @xcite .",

    "this is the density contrast that a collapsed region should have at collapse time if it had always evolved according to linear theory . in this paper",
    "we take total matter density @xmath186 and use the observations of neighbor clusters ( @xmath187 ) .",
    "given the power spectrum , we can obtain the cluster abundance from the press - schechter theory .",
    "when we determine the breaking scale @xmath151 , the power spectrum ratio @xmath188 , and the spectral index for new inflation @xmath90 , we can get the power spectrum up to normalization @xmath189 . using this power spectrum",
    "we can calculate the mass variance and obtain , from eq.([eq : ps ] ) , @xmath190    many clusters of galaxies are observed using x - ray fluxes . under the assumption that",
    "clusters are hydrostatic , we can obtain the mass - temperature relations as @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the ratio of the mean density of a cluster to the critical density at that redshift , @xmath193 is the ratio of specific galaxy kinetic energy to specific gas thermal energy , and @xmath194 is the hydrogen mass fraction .",
    "we take @xmath195 , @xmath196 , and @xmath197  @xcite .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ eq : mass - temperature ] ) reduces to @xmath198    the observed cluster abundance as a function of x - ray temperature can be translated into a function of mass using eq .",

    "we conclude that if @xmath209 lies in a @xmath205 range , that the parameter region of @xmath151 , @xmath168 , and @xmath90 is consistent with the cluster abundance observations ( see lightly shaded region of fig .",
