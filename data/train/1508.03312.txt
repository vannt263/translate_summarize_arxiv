    "astrophysics can be seen as remote sensing : the information on the physical conditions in the universe reaches us encoded in the spectra that we record with our telescopes .",
    "our task is to decode that information through spectral analysis .        with the discovery by pieter @xcite of the zeeman effect ,",
    "it became known that magnetic fields leave their encoded `` fingerprints '' in the splitting and polarization of spectral lines . through spectro - polarimetry we can therefore extract information on magnetic fields in remote objects .",
    "george ellery hale was the first to make use of this opportunity in astrophysics .",
    "he had noticed how the shape of the sun s corona suggests that the sun is a magnetized sphere with a global dipole - like field , and that the filamentary vortex structure of the h@xmath0 fibrils around sunspots indicate that sunspots are the seats of strong magnetic fields and vertical electric currents .",
    "this led him to look for and find pronounced zeeman splitting in sunspots @xcite .",
    "sunspots thus became the gateway to the exploration of cosmic magnetic fields , including the origin of the fields and their role in astrophysical plasmas .",
    "we now know that magnetic fields govern most cosmic variability on intermediate time scales and pervade all cosmic plasmas , generating structuring , thermodynamic effects , and instabilities",
    ". measurements of the sun s magnetic field has guided the development of magnetohydrodynamics and dynamo theories .",
    "the pioneering work by hale and his team led to the discovery of hale s polarity law ( the law that governs the e - w orientation of the sunspot polarities with respect to solar hemisphere and 11-yr cycle ) , which showed that the magnetic cycle is 22 yr ( the hale cycle ) , twice the length of the sunspot cycle @xcite .",
    "another fundamental discovery in the same paper is joy s law , which tells that the polarity orientation of bipolar magnetic regions deviates systematically ( in a statistical sense ) from the e - w direction : the orientation is tilted so that the leading part of the region ( with respect to the direction of solar rotation ) is closer to the equator than the following part .",
    "hale s and joy s laws serve as observational cornerstones of solar dynamo theory .",
    "the sun s dynamo can be seen as a prototype for all cosmic dynamos .",
    "soon after his discovery of magnetic fields in sunspots hale wanted to explore the non - spot `` background field '' , the so - called `` general '' magnetic field of the sun , which he believed to be a global dipole based on the appearance of the solar corona at eclipses .",
    "the observational technique was to place a grid of mica strips across the spectrograph slit , so that one gets an alternating sequence of left- and right - handed circularly polarized spectra . in the presence of a magnetic field",
    "there would be a relative line displacement between the opposite polarization states .",
    "the spectra were recorded on photographic plates , and the line positions were determined manually with a micrometer . with modern standards this was a crude technique not adequate for detection of the weak background fields .",
    "aware of the marginal nature of this undertaking and the danger of subjectivity in the results , hale let many of his assistants independently reduce the same plate material , and he claimed in the publications that the persons reducing the data were not informed about which heliographic latitude a given plate referred to .",
    "this was supposed to eliminate possible bias from the results .",
    "all of the assistants except two got null results ( consistent with what is to be expected in view of the measurement uncertainties ) .",
    "one of these two was a young postdoc who had recently arrived to pasadena from holland , van maanen .",
    "he immediately impressed hale by getting positive results , and hale gave most weight to his findings .",
    "this resulted in claims that the strength of the polar field was about an order of magnitude stronger than we find with modern , far more accurate techniques @xcite .",
    "in addition the polarity of the polar fields was opposite to what one would expect according the much later discovered model of the solar cycle by babcock ( 1961 ) .    in 1968 , shortly after completion of my doctoral thesis with the title `` the sun s magnetic field '' , i spent seven months in pasadena with the mt wilson observatory and decided to use this opportunity to explore the hale archives in search for an explanation of his enigmatic results on the sun s general magnetic field .",
    "i was able to locate 400 photographic plates recorded in 1914 , together with the meticulous notebook of van maanen with his micrometer measurements of the zeeman shifts for each of these plates .",
    "after having the plates carefully cleaned i took them in my car and drove to the sacramento peak observatory ( sunspot , new mexico ) , where they had a digitized microphotometer with which i could ( with the help of jacques beckers ) have all the plates scanned .",
    "i then brought the big magnetic tapes with the scanned data to lund , sweden , where i analyzed them with a cdc mainframe computer .",
    "my computer reduction gave null results ( within the standard error ) for the general magnetic field , while van maanen had found for the same set of plates a field much stronger than the standard error , which varied with heliographic latitude as a global dipole field with the wrong polarity @xcite .",
    "around the time of hale s pioneering solar work the astronomical community was involved in an intense debate on the nature of spiral nebulae : were they `` island universes '' ( what we now call galaxies ) , or were they nearby objects inside our milky way system ?",
    "van maanen joined this debate and provided what at that time seemed to be very convincing evidence against the island universe idea . around 1922 - 1923 he measured on photographic plates substantial proper motions along the spiral arms of m33 , which implied that the rotation period of m33 was smaller than that of the milky way by a factor of one thousand and that m33 could therefore not be very distant and large but had to be inside our galaxy ( cf . * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we now know that m33 is a galaxy and that whatever van maanen measured was not a real property .",
    "the general , background magnetic fields , which we now refer to as quiet - sun magnetic fields , gave too weak zeeman - effect signatures to be measurable with the technology that was available to hale .",
    "further progress had to wait until the breakthrough in sensitivity provided by the photoelectric magnetograph , introduced by @xcite . instead of manually measuring wavelength positions of spectral lines on photographic plates",
    "one used photomultipliers as detectors and electro - optical polarization modulation with an adp - type pockels cell .",
    "two exit windows in the spectral focal plane selected the light from the blue and red wing of a chosen zeeman - sensitive spectral line . a servo - controlled tilting glass plate near the spectral focal plane kept the spectral line centered with respect to the two exit slits .",
    "the tilt angle of the plate represented the measured doppler shift .",
    "the modulated polarization signals from the two exit slits were combined in a difference amplifier ( since the polarization signals from the two line wings have opposite signs  today we say that the stokes @xmath1 profile is anti - symmetric ) and then demodulated .",
    "since photomultipliers are `` 1-pixel detectors '' , a circular - polarization image ( which represents a `` magnetogram '' ) could only be built up through raster scanning of the solar image .",
    "the initial observations were crude , with a spatial resolution of order one arcmin , but they allowed the recording of full - disk magnetograms with a polarimetric sensitivity that was sufficient for mapping the weak background fields .",
    "thus babcock could initiate a synoptic full - disk magnetogram program at the mt wilson observatory .",
    "this synoptic program led babcock to the discovery that the general magnetic field , in particular the field in the polar caps of the sun , reverses sign every 11 years .",
    "thus not only the sunspot polarities but also the global magnetic field varies with the 22-yr hale cycle . the photoelectric magnetograph gave us a comprehensive empirical picture of solar magnetism .",
    "the underlying mechanism that governs the hale cycle must physically link the behavior of sunspots with the behavior of the global field .",
    "@xcite could integrate the various empirical results into a phenomenological theory for the solar cycle , which explicitly clarified how the bits and pieces were connected .",
    "the hale cycle represents an oscillation between a poloidal and a toroidal configuration of the magnetic field .",
    "the frozen - in field lines of the poloidal field are wound up by the latitudinal shear of the sun s differential rotation , so that a toroidal field is built up .",
    "when the strength of the amplified toroidal field exceeds a certain theshold , magnetic tension can no longer prevent buoyant sections of the subsurface flux ropes to float up to the surface to form bipolar magnetic regions with polarity orientations in the general e - w direction , with opposite orientations in the n and s hemispheres , as required by hale s polarity law . during the rise to the surface",
    "the flux loop is rotated by the coriolis force , resulting in a systematic tilt of the bipolar orientation with respect to the e - w direction , in qualitative agreement with joy s law .",
    "the tilt is such that the poleward ( following ) part of the bipolar region has a polarity that is opposite to that of the polar fields in the same hemisphere .",
    "when bipolar regions age , they fragment and spread by turbulent diffusion to form the general background field . because of the initial tilt of the bipolar regions it is the following polarity that will dominate the new background field at high latitudes , thereby cancelling and reversing the polar field .",
    "coriolis forces acting on buoyant toroidal flux combined with turbulent diffusion thus lead to a regeneration of a poloidal field with reversed polarity .",
    "while babcock s model was phenomenological , qualitative , and descriptive , it contained the physical ingredients that are central to modern dynamo theories . @xcite",
    "significantly extended babcock s model by giving it a formulation in terms of a set of semi - empirical equations that could be used for quantitative modeling of the evolution of the pattern of surface magnetic fields .",
    "the babcock - leighton framework has been used since the early 1980s by neil sheeley and coworkers at nrl ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for systematic modeling of the field pattern to understand its role for coronal holes , solar wind streams , and other large - scale phenomena on the sun .",
    "with the superior sensitivity of the photoelectric magnetograph one might think that the days of doing magnetometry with photographic plates were over . however , photographic plates represented 2-d detectors with an enormous number of `` pixels '' , which for mapping purposes with high angular resolution represented a huge advantage over photomultipliers , which are 1-pixel devices .",
    "robert leighton developed a photographic magnetograph technique based on the photographic recording of two simultaneous spectroheliograms in orthogonal circular polarization states @xcite , as illustrated in the left portion of fig .",
    "[ fig : leighton ] .",
    "subsequent photographic subtraction of the two images then results in a polarization map ( line - of - sight magnetogram ) .",
    "such photographic subtraction is of course a tricky business due to the non - linear response of photographic plates , but leighton and his followers developed it into an art .",
    "one place in particular where the leighton technique was perfected to produce not only high - resolution maps but also magnetic - field movies of outstanding quality was the san fernando observatory .",
    "the right part of fig .",
    "[ fig : leighton ] gives an example , from @xcite , of such a magnetogram , which clearly reveals that the magnetic pattern has a network structure .",
    "remarkable movies of the moat structure around sunspots were made , showing how flux fragments of opposite polarities stream away from the spots .",
    "leighton also used his subtractive spectroheliogram technique to make full - disk doppler maps of the sun , which led to his discovery of the supergranulation @xcite .",
    "the largely horizontal flows in the supergranulation were much more effective than the granular flows for the redistribution of the fields through `` turbulent diffusion '' .",
    "they came to play a major role in leighton s kinematic model of the solar cycle , in which he treated the redistribution as a random walk on the solar surface of the frozen - in field lines .",
    "spectroheliograms had since many decades been an established tool to make narrow - band monochromatic images of the sun for any chosen wavelength in the visible solar spectrum .",
    "they had revealed that chromospheric lines like the h and k lines of ionized calcium show a network - like emission pattern .",
    "leighton s doppler and magnetic - field maps showed that both the supergranular velocity network and the magnetic - field network were closely correlated with the emission network , they seemed to coincide with each other .",
    "the statistical correlations between these three types of network were intensely explored by many solar physicists around the end of the 1960s , in particular by recoding doppler and magnetic data through raster scans with a photoelectric magnetograph , which generally allowed the analysis to be more quantitative than with the photographic method .    in 1967",
    "neil sheeley published a seminal paper in which he showed that many photospheric lines had line gaps ( very significant line weakenings ) at the locations of the quiet - sun network , and that these were places with strong , small - scale flux concentrations , with field strengths reaching up to hundreds of g @xcite . in spectroheliograms the line gaps show up as a photospheric emission network .",
    "subsequently @xcite made an extensive spectroheliogram survey of the behavior of different photospheric spectral lines with various excitation potentials , to demonstrate that the line gaps were the result of increased photospheric temperature .",
    "the observations allowed the temperature structure of the photospheric network to be modeled .",
    "sheeley s hundred g quiet - sun field strengths were shockingly high for that time , but they still represented a lower limit determined by the spatial resolution of his instrument . since the intrinsic sizes of the network elements were not known and therefore not their filling factors @xmath2 , the intrinsic field strength would be @xmath3 times the apparent field strength .    to find the intrinsic field strength without achieving infinite angular resolution one had to come up with a resolution - independent approach , which occurred soon afterwards with the introduction of the magnetic line - ratio method ( cf .",
    "[ sec : mcmath ] ) .",
    "already hale in his early work on sunspot magnetic fields knew how to combine the measured circular and linear polarizations of the longitudinal and transverse zeeman effects to derive the magnetic - field vector ( strength and orientation of the field ) .",
    "formally such a zeeman - effect `` inversion '' is very straightforward . in practice",
    "the inversion often leads to false results because of a combination of factors , in particular non - linear response , non - gaussian noise , and unknown subresolution structure of the field .",
    "in contrast to the transverse zeeman effect , the polarization of the longitudinal zeeman effect has a nearly linear dependence on the field ( via its line - of - sight component ) with a gaussian noise distribution , and also has high field sensitivity .",
    "this is the reason why most observational explorations of the magnetic field has been of its line - of - sight component .",
    "what we call `` magnetogram '' is always a circular - polarization map ; in the more rare cases when also the zeeman effect in the linear polarization is being recorded we use the term `` vector magnetogram '' .",
    "soon after babcock s introduction of the photoelectric magnetograph his concept was being extended at various places , including crimea , izmiran ( near moscow ) , pulkovo by leningrad , and ondejov by prague , to record vector magnetic fields .",
    "both the circular and linear polarizations in a selected spectral line were modulated by pockels cells .",
    "the demodulated signals were recorded with ink pen on strip - chart recorders and combined to give the magnetic - field vector .",
    "the pioneering work in vector magnetometry was done at the crimean astrophysical observatory , where @xcite published the first vector - field maps of the sun .",
    "figure [ fig : vectormap ] from @xcite shows an example of maps of the vector magnetic field around sunspots ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "vector magnetometry was a hot topic in solar physics of the 1960s , because it was seen as a tool for the exploration of the full mhd structure of the solar atmosphere .",
    "maxwell s equations were being used to derive maps of the vertical electric current density from the horizontal gradients of the observed transverse magnetic fields .",
    "the pattern of vertical electric currents was found to correlate with the locations where flares occurred , as expected in the current - interruption theory of solar flares by @xcite . around that time",
    "alfvn was finding it more revealing to describe mhd environments in terms of the electric current structure instead of magnetic fields , since currents are responsible for the pinch effect and could cause instabilities with the development of double layers , in which the mhd approximations break down .",
    "the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : vectormap ] indicates how the apparent transverse field rotates with height in the atmosphere .",
    "superposing the results obtained with four spectral lines formed at different heights one reveals how the azimuth angle varies .",
    "this behavior suggests that the field lines are twisted , as expected in the presence of vertical electric currents .",
    "however , the interpretation has to also account for the apparent twist induced by magneto - optical effects .",
    "the crimean astrophysical observatory was not only the world - leading institute in vector magnetometry , it was also the place where the theoretical foundations for the interpretation of magnetograph measurements were developed . while wasaburo unno in japan had published a phenomenological but correct derivation of the radiative transfer equation for the stokes vector @xcite , it was the work of stepanov and rachkovsky at crimea that brought us a self - consistent mathematical derivation that also included the magneto - optical effects .",
    "while stepanov formulated this approach ( stepanov 1958a , b ) , rachkovsky completed the theory to give us a mathematically stringent and comprehensive ( within the assumption of lte ) formulation of the stokes vector radiative transfer problem ( rachkovsky 1962a , b ) .",
    "rachkovsky s theory was used to identify observational signatures of magneto - optical effects in the recordings with the crimean magnetograph .        in 1965",
    "the academies of sciences in sweden and the soviet union signed an exchange agreement .",
    "it happened , thanks to the contacts and support of my mentor hannes alfvn , that i was the first from the swedish side to be sent over to work in the ussr under this agreement .",
    "alfvn believed that the sun s magnetic field had a filamentary fine structure induced by the pinch effect of electric currents , and that this fine structure invalidated babcock s observations since it was not resolved .",
    "he conjectured that if the field consisted of `` microspots '' with less visibility because of their different thermodynamic properties , then the spatial averaging process would lead to the wrong interpretation of the measurements @xcite .",
    "alfvn had a strong incentive to see babcock s results invalidated , since a general magnetic field that reversed sign every 11 years contradicted alfvn s own theory of the solar cycle .",
    "he sent me to crimea with the mission to confirm his conjecture by exploring the fine structure with the crimean magnetograph .",
    "my mission failed , since my work rather helped to validate babcock s results .",
    "however , alfvn s ideas put me on a path to explore the nature of the unresolved magnetic fine structure and how it can be properly diagnosed .",
    "this path took me in productive directions that none of us could foresee at that time .",
    "thus at age 22 i spent three summer months in 1965 to study the fine structure of quiet - sun magnetic fields with the crimean magnetograph , and i returned for another four months in the summer of 1966 .",
    "this work gave the observational basis for my doctoral thesis , which i completed in the spring of 1968 ( at the university of lund , sweden ) .",
    "figure [ fig : severny ] shows me during the visit in 1965 together with the director of the crimean astrophysical observatory , andrei borisovich severny , who was the most prominent soviet solar physicist at the time .",
    "the crimean astrophysical observatory was a world leader in solar physics in the 1960s , it was an exciting time to be there . however , towards the end of the decade began a period of political and economic stagnation and decline , which finally ended in the collapse of the soviet union .",
    "figure [ fig : kotov ] contains photos that i took of the solar magnetograph when i visited crimea again in 2011 .",
    "the electronic equipment , control panels , and strip - chart recorders were much the same as when i worked there 45 years before .",
    "it was like going back in time , not much had changed . in the right panel",
    "is valery kotov , who still uses this equipment to study the 160-min oscillations of the sun .",
    "i became befriended with him in 1965 , when he was a phd student at crimea . in his thesis on the electromagnetic structure of active regions he used vector magnetic - field mapping not only to determine the vertical electric - current density , but also",
    "the horizontal current density and therefore the _ vector electric currents_. the horizontal electric currents were found by recording the transverse magnetic field at different heights , and then from the height gradients of the horizontal field components use maxwell s equations to obtain the horizontal components of the current .",
    "since there has been a revival in the mapping of vector magnetic fields in recent years in the context of stokes inversions , one may wonder how reliable all the pioneering results from the 1960s about the vector magnetic fields were .",
    "my general answer is that the maps of the relative distributions of azimuth orientations of the transverse fields are reliable ( as long as one accounts for the magneto - optical effects in the interpretation ) .",
    "likewise the maps of the line - of - sight flux density ( regular magnetograms ) are also reliable .",
    "however , the magnitudes of the transverse flux density have been greatly overestimated , with the result that the determined field inclinations are much too large , the fields appear much more transverse than they really are .",
    "the main source of the problem is that the relation between the measured linear polarization and the transverse field strength is highly non - linear ( in contrast to the case for the circular polarization ) .",
    "this has two consequences for observations that do not have high s / n ratio : ( 1 ) the spatial averaging over unresolved subpixel structures depends on the nature of this structuring .",
    "ignoring this problem always leads to errors in the direction of artificially enhancing the transverse fields .",
    "( 2 ) the noise distribution of the transverse fields is highly non - gaussian , with an extended non - gaussian tail that makes the fields look much more transverse than they are . since in addition",
    "the polarization amplitudes that are produced by a given field strength are much smaller ( by typically a factor of 25 ) for the linear polarization relative to the circular polarization , the noise infiltrates the transverse fields much more than the longitudinal fields , always in the direction of making the fields appear much too transverse .",
    "this problem does not go away by using improved stokes inversion techniques , because it is not a technical problem .",
    "the only known way to fully eliminate the transverse - field bias ( in the weak - field quiet - sun case ) is to use a statistical approach with ensemble averages ( cf .",
    "[ sec : ensemble ] ) , averaging the stokes @xmath4 linear polarization as observed away from disk center ( to break the symmetry ) , without trying to convert @xmath4 to transverse field strength , since such conversion is the source of the non - linearities and the non - gaussian noise . because the ensemble averages are independent of the spatial resolution of the instrument ( since @xmath4 is proportional to the number of photons received ) , and because the noise distribution in @xmath4 is gaussian and thus symmetric , the ensemble averages of stokes @xmath4 give unbiased results that neither favors horizontal nor vertical .",
    "application of this technique has shown that quiet - sun magnetic fields are preferentially vertical ( with respect to the isotropic angular distribution ) in the low to middle photosphere ( as observed in photospheric lines over most over the solar disk ) but become preferentially horizontal in the upper photosphere ( as observed close to the solar limb , cf . * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we have seen how babcock integrated the various empirical findings into a phenomenological model of the solar cycle , which contained the main physical ingredients that govern the activity cycle of the sun in terms of an interplay between turbulence and magnetic fields in a rotating magnetized plasma .",
    "we are now convinced that these ingredients are responsible for the generation of large - scale magnetic fields all over the universe , not only in stars and planets , but also on galactic scales .",
    "the sun s 22-yr magnetic cycle is a prototype for all cosmic dynamos .          in a letter to nature in 1942 ( my birth year ) my mentor hannes alfvn presented ( two decades before babcock ) an alternative explanation for the origin of the sunspot cycle @xcite . in his scenario",
    "the sun possessed a global dipole - like field that was a remnant from the formation of the solar system .",
    "this field therefore penetrated the core of the sun , so it could not reverse ( in contradiction to babcock s later findings ) . at that time",
    "it was believed that the cno cycle rather than the p - p reaction chain was responsible for the thermonuclear energy production .",
    "this had the consequence that the central temperature was considered to be as high as 25 million k , and that a steep temperature gradient would cause the solar core to be in a convective state .",
    "alfvn therefore postulated that the sunspots originated from disturbances in the central regions of the sun , and that these disturbances traveled as waves ( later called alfvn waves ) along the global dipole field , emerging at the surface as sunspots .",
    "we now know this explanation of the solar cycle to be incorrect . however , in this short paper alfvn for the first time introduced the concept of mhd waves , explaining why disturbances in a magnetized plasma would propagate as transverse waves along the field lines with a speed that we now refer to as the alfvn velocity .",
    "it was for the discovery of these waves that he received the 1970 nobel prize in physcis .",
    "although he introduced this wave concept within the context of an incorrect theory for the solar cycle , it was a nobel - prize worthy discovery that has since played a fundamental role in all of plasma physics .",
    "it is an example of how wrong theories can contain elements of great value !",
    "the concept of explaining the origin of macroscopic magnetic fields in terms of dynamo processes goes back to @xcite , but subsequent progress towards a viable theory was relatively slow .",
    "one serious obstacle was the `` anti - dynamo theorem '' of @xcite ( cf .",
    "[ fig : cowling ] ) , which was a proof that an axially symmetric velocity field , like that of a rotating medium , was incapable of generating a dynamo .",
    "such idealized geometries were insufficient , the symmetry had to be broken for dynamo action to occur .    while walter elsasser from the university of utah had overcome this obstacle and established the mathematical framework of dynamo theory , and in particular applied it to explain terrestrial magnetism @xcite , eugene parker of chicago extended the ideas to the solar case and highlighted how coriolis forces in a rotating and turbulent medium make the turbulence cyclonic and thereby can regenerate the poloidal field from the toroidal one @xcite .",
    "babcock made use of these ideas when he built his phenomenological model of the solar cycle .",
    "parker was the leading theoretical solar physicist for several decades , with fundamental contributions over a broad range of topics , including the origin of the solar wind , the cause of intermittency in the photospheric magnetic flux , and the mechanism for coronal heating .",
    "figure [ fig : cospar ] shows him at the cospar meeting in tokyo in 1968 .",
    "alfvn had heard that max steenbeck in jena , ddr , had developed a new and comprehensive formulation of the dynamo problem , and therefore sent me to jena in 1969 to find out how the theory worked .",
    "max steenbeck was a leading person in the east german establishment , head of the country s research council with the rank like that of a government minister .",
    "however , he was foremost an innovative scientist , who had built up a leading group in plasma physics in jena . soon after my arrival he took me into his office , called in his young collaborators fritz krause and karl - heinz rdler , and described to me on the blackboard the ideas behind the @xmath6 dynamo .",
    "figure [ fig : steenbeck ] shows steenbeck at his desk on that occasion in 1969 .",
    "the key to a comprehensive mathematical formulation of the dynamo problem was the development of mean - field electrodynamics @xcite . assuming that the spatial and temporal scales of the turbulence are small in comparison with the global scales to allow ensemble avergaging",
    ", one could express the statistical effect of cyclonic turbulence as an electromotive force along the field lines with @xmath0 as the proportionality constant .",
    "a second - order term in the ensemble average of the turbulence represented turbulent diffusion with coefficient @xmath7 .",
    "the poloidal field lines get wound up by the shear ( radial and latitudinal ) in the sun s rotational angular velocity @xmath5 .",
    "the evolution of the global solar magnetic field can then be formulated in terms of two coupled equations describing the interplay between the @xmath0 , @xmath7 , and @xmath5 effects , one equation for the poloidal component , one for the toroidal .",
    "decomposition of these components in their spherical harmonics leads to a coupled system of equations for the eigenvalue problem , which allows very explicit and consistent modeling of the solar cycle .",
    "this type of modeling is very general and can be applied to account for the magnetic fields in various types of other stars , planets , and galaxies .",
    "i returned to jena in 1970 at the time when the institute was being moved from jena to potsdam , and i participated in the move .",
    "the potsdam institute established itself as a leading center for dynamo research during the following decades .          in the caption to fig .",
    "[ fig : cowling ] we mentioned how bob howard took over the pioneering work of horace babcock and developed the first synoptic program for full - disk line - of - sight component magnetograms recorded daily at the mount wilson observatory . later",
    "( in the early 1970s ) similar synoptic programs were started at stanford by john wilcox and at kitt peak by bill livingston and jack harvey .",
    "the stanford program continues to this day with well defined but low spatial resolution .",
    "the kitt peak program has had the highest spatial resolution of the ground - based programs and was upgraded in the late 1990s by jack harvey and christoph keller as part of the solis synoptic program .",
    "the most advanced synoptic full - disk magnetogram projects have been the space programs _ soho_/mdi ( 1995 - 2011 ) and its superior successor , _ sdo_/hmi .",
    "both have been managed by the stanford group .",
    "john wilcox had close contacts with hannes alfvn and was in the audience in stockholm when i in 1966 gave a colloquium at alfvns institute on my observations of the sun s magnetic fine structure at the crimean astrophysical observatory .",
    "his main scientific focus at the time was on the physical properties of the solar wind and its sources on the sun .",
    "he visited me at the swedish solar station on capri in 1967 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : wilcox ] ) . when i for the first time set foot on us soil ( in 1968 after the defense of my doctoral dissertation in lund )",
    "wilcox had arranged that i spent the first four nights at the faculty club of the berkeley campus ( later wilcox moved from berkeley to stanford ) .",
    "i had made a world - around trip , so i entered the us from the west .",
    "it was berkeley june 1968 at the height of the vietnam war , and it was my first impression of what american society was like !",
    "after wilcox tragic accidental death in 1984 by drowning while swimming in hawaii , the synoptic stanford solar observatory was renamed wilcox solar observatory .",
    "when the sun is observed with improved angular resolution we discover previously unknown structures which deepen our physical understanding , like the granular convection pattern , the chromospheric filamentary structures , network and internetwork bright points , etc .",
    "photospheric magnetic flux is highly intermittent with basic kg flux elements having typical sizes of order 100 km or below .",
    "most of the size distribution is beyond reach of current telescopes , although flux tubes in the larger - scale tail of the distribution have been resolved .",
    "the magnetic - field pattern has a fractal - like structure , with a structuring that continues far beyond the resolution limit .",
    "it has therefore always been a high priority for solar physicists to push for ever higher angular resolution , since it is widely believed that the fundamental physical mechanisms to a large extent are connected to processes at the smallest scales .",
    "half a century ago the leading solar physics facilities were in the us ( mount wilson in california , kitt peak with the mcmath telescope in arizona , sacramento peak in new mexico ) and the ussr ( crimean astrophysical observatory ) .",
    "the european solar physics community felt a strong need to overcome the political fragmentation after two devastating world wars and create a joint european solar facility that would again give europe a leading role in science , as had been done by cern for particle physics and by eso for night - time astronomy .",
    "the driving force behind this pan - european solar physics movement was karl - otto kiepenheuer , director of the fraunhofer institute ( after his death renamed kiepenheuer institute for solar physics ) in freiburg , germany . in the late 1960s kiepenheuer set up an informal european organization with the name joso , joint organization for solar observations @xcite , which had the goal of constructing a major european solar telescope , lest ( large european solar telescope ) .",
    "this goal was to be achieved in two steps : ( 1 ) search by systematic site testing campaigns for the optimum location of lest .",
    "( 2 ) establishment of a new organization with legal structure and adequate financial means to design and construct lest at the chosen site .",
    "figure [ fig : kiepen ] shows kiepenheuer at one of the first meetings of joso , in freiburg 1969 . beside him",
    "is jean rsch , director of the pic du midi observatory , representing france .",
    "holland was represented by kees de jager , who founded the journal solar physics and later served as president of cospar , italy by guglielmo righini , director of the arcetri observatory in florence , while i was representing sweden .    after having done site testing of a number of coastal sites in portugal , sicily , and greece",
    "it was concluded that high - altitude volcanic island sites would be better , and that therefore the site testing should concentrate on tenerife ( izaa ) and la palma ( roque de los muchachos ) in the canary islands . towards the end of the 1970s",
    "these site testing campaigns came to the conclusion that both izaa and roque de los muchachos were indeed outstanding sites of comparable quality .",
    "there was no clear recommendation which of the two was better .",
    "both are at the same elevation , just above the well - defined inversion layer where the clouds form . at these sites",
    "the wind direction is most of the time such that the line of sight from the telescope to the sun is in a laminar air flow if the telescope sits on top of a tower high enough to avoid ground turbulence .",
    "this leads to excellent seeing , while the high altitude causes scattered light from the sky to be low .        rather than waiting for a lest to be realized ,",
    "various countries quickly decided to set up their national facilities on these sites .",
    "germany chose izaa , where the kiepenheuer institute in freiburg built the vtt ( vacuum tower telescope ) while the university observatory of gttingen set up the gregory - coud  telescope that they had transferred from their solar station in locarno , switzerland .",
    "similarly the french built their themis 90 cm aperture polarization - free telescope at izaa .",
    "the swedes ( through their observatory director arne wyller , who had succeeded yngve hman , founder of the swedish capri observatory ) transferred their solar station in anacapri to roque de los muchachos , where also the dutch established themselves with the dot ( dutch open telescope ) , designed by rob hammerschlag . soon after , the telescope at the swedish la palma observatory was completely rebuilt with an innovative design by gran scharmer , who later took over as observatory director . under scharmer",
    "the la palma facility became the unrivaled world leader in solar imaging with the highest angular resolution .",
    "no other solar facility in the world has yet consistently achieved such resolution .    in parallel with these national activities the efforts towards the realization of the lest dream made rapid progress .",
    "a new organization , the lest foundation , was established in 1983 with legal seat at the royal swedish academy of sciences .",
    "its task was to execute the intentions of joso , to obtain the financial means , develop the detailed design , and to construct and operate lest at the chosen site .",
    "the scientific aim was focused on recording magnetic fields with the highest possible spatial resolution @xcite . throughout its existence the lest foundation was led by a `` triumvirate '' , with me as president , oddbjrn engvold of oslo as project director , and kai - inge hillerud of the royal swedish academy in stockholm as executive secretary .",
    "the innovative design was led by engvold with crucial input from richard dunn , us master optical designer , who made the sacramento peak observatory ( new mexico ) become the leading high - resolution facility in the us , and from torben andersen , who was a danish telescope designer at eso . since other non - european countries like the us and china joined the lest foundation as members , the acronym was redefined as large earth - based solar telescope , to emphasize that it was not just a european but a truly international undertaking .    around the end of the 1980s",
    "the detailed design for the entire facility had been completed , the definite site had been selected ( on roque de los muchachos near the swedish la palma observatory ) , we were ready to start the construction phase , and it appeared that the needed funding support was forthcoming @xcite .",
    "dramatic external events changed the situation .",
    "when the soviet union collapsed , germany turned all its priorities and financial resources toward the enormous task ( and historical opportunity ) of german reunification , with the consequence that the expected substantial german contributions to the construction phase of lest would not be available in the foreseeable future .",
    "the lest project was put on hold for another decade ( although during this time many design studies for various focal - plane instrumentations were carried out ) , until it was finally decided to dissolve the lest foundation as of june 30 , 2002 .    as the lest",
    "project lost momentum in the 1990s , the idea of a next - general type international solar facility was being developed in the us in the form of atst ( advanced technology solar telescope ) , with an innovative 4 m aperture telescope design by jacques beckers .",
    "this ambitious project , renamed dkist ( daniel k. inouye solar telescope ) is now in construction at the haleakala site on maui and is expected to be in operation by 2020 .    before the lest foundation",
    "was dissolved , torben andersen and oddbjrn engvold designed a scaled down version of lest , which has since been implemented in the form of the chinese 1-m solar telescope at the fuxian lake near kunming and the 1.5-m german gregor telescope on tenerife ( which has replaced the 45 cm gttingen gregory - coud telescope ) .",
    "the original lest idea of a joint european solar facility has been resurrected within europe in the form of est ( european solar telescope ) , aiming for a telescope in the dkist class , and it is progressing well with the help of eu funding .      in the late 1960s and the following decades",
    "the leading us facility for solar observations with high spatial resolution was the tower telescope at the sacramento peak observatory in new mexico , which had been designed by richard dunn and later given the name dst ( dunn solar telescope ) .",
    "however , the main innovations and advances in the exploration of solar magnetic fields took place at the mcmath telescope at kitt peak because of the many contributions of in particular william livingston , jack and karen harvey , jim brault , and neil sheeley .",
    "this giant telescope had been designed by robert mcmath but was renamed the mcmath - pierce facility after the death of the head of the kitt peak solar department , keith pierce .",
    "harvey and livingston implemented innovative techniques for magnetic - field mapping , which much advanced our insight and understanding of the small - scale nature of the fields ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . around 1974",
    "they initiated the synoptic program of daily kitt peak full - disk magnetograms and synoptic maps that resolved the field in much greater detail than anywhere else .",
    "wife karen discovered together with sara martin of the san fernando observatory the ephemeral active regions @xcite .",
    "jim brault developed a fourier transform spectrometer ( fts ) for the visible part of the spectrum @xcite , which with the help of jack harvey could be converted into an fts polarimeter .",
    "my own main observational work has been done with the mcmath - pierce facility . in september 1971",
    "i applied the magnetic line - ratio technique ( with the 5250 - 5247  line pair ) to discover that more than 90%  of the magnetic flux that had been recorded in solar magnetograms ( with a resolution of a few arcsec ) on the quiet sun actually is in kg form but appears weak since it is unresolved with a small filling factor @xcite . in 1978 - 79",
    "i used the fts polarimeter to make atlases of the stokes @xmath1 spectra in plages and the network and surveys of the linearly polarized spectrum near the solar limb .",
    "the stokes @xmath1 spectra @xcite led to detailed physical validation of the line - ratio technique , revealed the nature of the stokes @xmath1 asymmetries , and could be used by sami solanki , my first phd student at eth zurich , to apply multi - line techniques for the empirical modeling of solar magnetic flux tubes .",
    "the linear polarization survey led to the discovery of the second solar spectrum ( cf .",
    "[ sec : ss2 ] ) , which is formed exclusively by coherent scattering processes and is the playground for the hanle effect .",
    "when the zimpol technology had been developed at eth zurich it was used from 1994 onwards at the mcmath - pierce facility for systematic explorations of the second solar spectrum with a polarimetric precision of @xmath8 .",
    "the main hanle - effect constraints on the properties of the hidden turbulent magnetic fields have come from zimpol observations at kitt peak .",
    "the main reason why the mcmath - pierce facility has served as the premier place for innovative , experimental solar science is , besides its high light - gathering capacity ( 1.5 m entrance aperture ) the large , open experimental environment in the spatious observing room , with free access to the large solar image and unrestricted access to the beam in front of the entrance slit of the spectrograph , which makes it simple to insert novel experimental equipment .",
    "other large astronomical telescopes generally do not allow experimental freedom of this kind .",
    "it will be greatly missed with the closure of the mcmath - pierce facility .",
    "the fts polarimeter allowed unprecedented insight into the physical nature of the spatially unresolved magnetic fields .",
    "it allowed the simultaneous recording of the spectra of stokes @xmath9 ( the ordinary intensity ) and one of @xmath4 , @xmath10 , or @xmath1 with full spectral resolution ( absence of significant instrumental spectral smearing ) , no spectral stray light , and with simultaneous wavelength coverage over the full spectral range admitted by the broad - band prefilter used ( typically 1000 ) .",
    "this was far beyond what one could dream of achieving with any spectrograph system .",
    "the trade - off was low angular resolution ( 5arcsec at the time ) and temporal resolution ( tens of minutes ) .",
    "since the vast majority of solar physicists had their focus on high spatial resolution , few took interest in the use of the fts polarimeter , i became almost its only user .",
    "as an example fig .",
    "[ fig : fts ] shows a 4.5  wide portion of the fts spectral atlas of a weak plage recorded in 1979 .",
    "in particular it illustrates the exact behavior of the stokes @xmath1 profiles of the lines fei 5247.06 and 5250.22 , which belong the magnetic line - ratio pair that was used with the mcmath babcock - type magnetograph system to reveal that most of the photospheric magnetic flux that had been recorded in magnetograms has its origin in strong , 1 - 2 kg bundled fields with small filling factors .",
    "analysis of the observed stokes @xmath1 line shapes allows a detailed validation of this interpretation .",
    "the fts stokes @xmath1 atlases are available both as pdf and data files at http://www.irsol.ch/data_archive/#ftsv .    the stokes @xmath1 spectral atlases and their center - to - limb variations represented a gold mine for the construction of empirical models of the spatially unresolved kg flux tubes , which was exploited by sami solanki in his phd thesis project at eth zurich .",
    "sami went on to become director at the max - panck - institute for solar system research in gttingen , where he led the successful _ sunrise _ project to observe solar magnetic fields with unprecedented spatial resolution from a stratospheric balloon @xcite .",
    "the fts polarimeter represented a remarkable advance in solar instrumentation , but it has now been decommissioned , and no similar instrument exists anywhere else .",
    "there are not even plans within any of the main solar telescope projects to build another instrument of this type .",
    "like the 1970s represented a heroic era when we could fly people to the moon but are not able to do it any more ( or have lost interest in it ) , fts polarimetry represents a lost art , without sufficient motivation anywhere to resurrect it .",
    "it is true that the fts polarimeter in the 1970s had low spatial and temporal resolution and used 1-pixel detectors , but it was in principle possible to improve the resolutions and to use multi - pixel detector arrays , although it is technically difficult .",
    "however , these improvements were never done , because they were not requested by the broader solar community .",
    "application of the magnetic 5250/5247 line ratio method through my 1971 kitt peak observations allowed me to conclude that most of the measured quiet - sun magnetic flux is in kg form @xcite . for me",
    "the evidence was so clear that i considered the case as closed .",
    "since however this conclusion was not reached by resolving the kg fields , but indirectly , through the identification of a telltale spectral signature that could not have any other interpretation , it took many years before my result found broad acceptance within the community , even after the interpretation got validated with the independent fts polarimeter data . over the years various people presented their own conclusions about the existence of quiet - sun kg fields as if it were a new discovery .",
    "while as time went by ever fewer people questioned the existence of kg flux on the quiet sun , two leading scientists within the solar community never accepted it : andrei severny , director of the largest astrophysical observatory in the soviet union , and harold zirin of caltech , who founded the big bear solar observatory ( which presently has the largest - aperture solar telescope in the world ) .",
    "after severny passed away in 1987 , hal zirin remained the stronghold of resistance .",
    "hal seemed to enjoy this controversy . in 1992",
    "he organized an iau colloquium in beijing and invited me to have a debate with him there on the reality of the kg fields ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the debate between the two of us was set up to represent a highlight of the conference .",
    "the lively event did not change any opinions , but i remember the atmosphere as friendly and entertaining .",
    "hal and i respected each other in spite of our opposite views .",
    "long after , it seems that some remember this event as a debate about whether the quiet - sun fields are weak or strong .",
    "this is not at all what it was about .",
    "there has always been agreement that most of the photospheric volume is filled with weak fields . the intermittent kg flux picture that resulted from application of the line - ratio technique implied that only about 1%  of the photospheric volume is occupied by kg fields , while the remaining 99%  has much weaker fields .",
    "the discovery of the kg fields was followed by a focus on finding the properties of the remaining 99%  weak fields .",
    "these efforts led to the discovery that one can use the symmetry properties of the hanle effect to constrain the field strengths of these weak fields @xcite .",
    "so the beijing debate in 1992 was not about whether the fields are strong or weak , it was whether there exist kg - type magnetic fields on the quiet sun , which carry much of the magnetic flux that we see in solar magnetograms .",
    "zirin always denied the existence of such fields , and he never gave up this position .",
    "while the initial observations of quiet - sun magnetic fields by babcock was with arcmin angular resolution , the observing techniques advanced rapidly in subsequent years , so that by the end of the 1960s an angular resolution of better than a few arcsec could be reached . with each new resolution breakthrough",
    "there was a tendency to proclaim that the magnetic structures had finally been resolved .",
    "we now know that such proclamations were wildly premature , since the magnetic structuring continues to far smaller scales ( cf .",
    "[ fig : enspec ] below ) .    with the realization that the fields remain largely unresolved came the need to find resolution - independent spectral signatures that could reveal the intrinsic properties of the fields as they would appear with infinite resolution .",
    "since the field morphology is not resolved , such techniques must be statistical in nature , making use of ensemble averages of field elements to find the intrinsic statistical properties of the elements that make up the ensemble .",
    "the magnetic line - ratio method is an example of such a technique .",
    "since the field elements are far from resolved , the angular - resolution window of the instrument averages over an ensemble of fields with a vast range of field strengths , both weak and strong .",
    "the _ differential _ effects between the ensemble - averaged stokes @xmath1 profiles of the 5250 - 5247  line pair allow us to conclude that most of the resolved stokes @xmath1 signal gets its contribution from intrinsically kg flux elements .",
    "the 5250 - 5247 pair is the only known line combination for which the kg interpretation is unique , because thermodynamic and radiative - transfer effects are unable to produce differential effects of the observed kind ( in contrast to the case for all other considered line combinations ) .",
    "two other types of spectral signatures from ensemble averages of stokes parameters have led to profound insights into the hidden small - scale nature of solar magnetic fields : ( 1 ) depolarization signature in the linear scattering polarization , caused by the hanle effect of an ensemble of microturbulent ( optically thin ) magnetic fields with random orientations of their field vectors @xcite .",
    "these fields represent most of the weaker ( non - kg ) fields that occupy approximately 99%  of the photospheric volume .",
    "( 2 ) sign pattern of the ensemble - average of stokes @xmath4 from the transverse zeeman effect as observed away from disk center ( which is needed to break the symmetry to give non - zero signatures ) .",
    "this sign pattern is an unbiased and resolution - independent signature of the vertical or horizontal preference ( with respect to the isotropic case ) of the angular distribution of the field vectors of the ensemble ( * ? ? ?",
    "the discussion at end of section [ sec : vector ] ) .",
    "since hale the zeeman effect has been the main tool for the diagnostics of cosmic magnetic fields . in recent decades , however , the hanle effect has emerged as a complementary tool that is sensitive to fields in parameter domains that are nearly inaccessible to the zeeman effect .",
    "the main reason why it has not yet been so widely used but rather been an area for a smaller community of specialists is that the underlying physics is complicated and the applications are not so straightforward .",
    "the observations require higher polarimetric sensitivity , and the interpretations generally need vector radiative transfer with scattering and partial frequency redistribution in magnetized media , a subject area that is still not fully developed .",
    "the interpretations are also sensitive to the assumptions concerning the 3-d geometry of the atmosphere . due to such complications",
    "much of the astrophysical exploitation of the hanle effect still lies in the future .",
    "the hanle effect was discovered by wilhelm hanle ( cf .",
    "[ fig : hanle ] ) in 1923 during his phd work in gttingen @xcite .",
    "it played an important role in the early development of quantum mechanics because it represented an explicit expression of the concept of linear superposition of quantum states and the decoherence that is caused by an external magnetic field .",
    "it soon found applications over a wide range of fields in physics before it was realized that it could also have important applications in astrophysics ( cf .",
    "hanle himself was enthusiastic when he learnt about the astrophysical applications .",
    "the blue sky is polarized due to rayleigh scattering at molecules in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "similarly the sun s spectrum gets linearly polarized because coherent scattering processes in the continuum and the various spectral lines contribute to the formation of the spectrum .",
    "magnetic fields are not the source of the scattering polarization , but they modify it and thereby generate observable spectral signatures .",
    "it is this magnetically - induced modification that is referred to when we speak of the hanle effect .",
    "it was realized already in the 1920s by @xcite that such scattering polarization should exist on the sun .",
    "yngve hman was the founder of the swedish solar station on capri and was one of my mentors ( since i started my solar work on capri at age 20 in 1963 ) .",
    "the first reliable observational evidence came when gnter brckner recorded the scattering polarization near the sun s limb in the cai 4227  line with the telescope at gttingen s solar station in locarno , switzerland @xcite . in the mid 1980s",
    "the ownership of the observatory was transferred to switzerland and it was renamed irsol ( istituto ricerche solari locarno ) . its scientific focus is the exploration of the scattering polarization and the hanle effect with the powerful imaging polarimetry system zimpol that was developed at eth zurich ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : ss2 ] ) .    the first consistent interpretation of the non - magnetic 4227  observations in terms of polarized radiative transfer was made by @xcite in paris .",
    "the first observation of the hanle effect in an astrophysical context was done in solar prominences by @xcite at the pic du midi observatory .",
    "figure [ fig : leroy ] shows jean - louis leroy when i visited him at pic du midi in 1970 .",
    "the personal contacts developed during my extended periods of work in the soviet union in the 1960s led to the opportunity for sweden to build instruments to be flown on soviet intercosmos satellites . due to the severe limitations in space , weight , and telemetry we had to come up with an idea of doing something qualitatively different , not attempted with the much larger resources available elsewhere .",
    "our choice was to build a swedish spectro - polarimeter for the solar vacuum ultraviolet , to search for signatures of polarization due to coherent scattering in h lyman @xmath0 and in emission lines formed in the chromosphere - corona transition region .",
    "this project represented my own entry into the field of scattering polarization physics .        during the first attempt to launch the swedish experiment , in 1975 ,",
    "the soviet rocket exploded and all the experiments were destroyed .",
    "however , we had a spare model that could be successfully put in orbit the following year on the satellite intercosmos 16 ( the satellite that exploded was never assigned a number in the intercosmos series  officially it did not exist ) .",
    "i participated in the launch preparations during three weeks at the super - secret military launch site of kapustin yar near volgograd .",
    "it was the first time that anyone from a western country was admitted to a soviet launch site .",
    "our uv spectro - polarimeter functioned as it was supposed to , but contamination of the uv optics due to outgassing in orbit from other parts of the spacecraft ( because the integration had not been performed in a cleanroom but in a dirty garage environment ) caused the optical transmission to quickly degrade by a factor of one hundred , increasing the polarimetric noise by an order of magnitude .",
    "it was therefore only possible to set an upper limit of 1%  for the h lyman @xmath0 scattering polarization near the limb as observed with one arcmin spatial resolution @xcite .",
    "although this meager scientific output was a disappointment , the experiment demonstrated the feasibility of doing spectro - polarimetry in the vacuum ultraviolet .",
    "there is considerable potential for using the scattering polarization and its magnetic modification via the hanle effect in this part of the spectrum as a tool to explore the elusive magnetic fields in the chromosphere - corona transition region , where the physical processes responsible for coronal heating take place .",
    "still , four decades later , this potential has not yet been exploited , but finally there is hope for some progress : the _ clasp _ rocket experiment for recording the hanle effect in h lyman @xmath0 is ready to be launched ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "the uv space experiment led to my interest in a systematic exploration of the physics of scattering polarization and its signatures in the sun s spectrum . in 1978",
    "i used the grating spectrograph and the fts at the kitt peak mcmath telescope to make a spectral survey of the linear polarization inside the solar limb , from 3165 to 9950   ( stenflo et al .",
    "1983a , b ) .",
    "this led to the discovery of the so - called second solar spectrum , which is the linearly polarized spectrum that is exclusively caused by coherent scattering processes on the sun .",
    "for more convenience it is now referred to with the acronym ss2 , implying that the ordinary intensity spectrum is ss1 .",
    "there is a need to refer to ss2 as a totally different spectrum because the fractional linear polarization stokes @xmath11 is as richly spectrally structured as the ordinary intensity spectrum , but with structures that look entirely different and which are formed by largely different physical processes .",
    "its discovery led to intense theoretical work trying to identify all the unfamiliar spectral features and develop the quantum - mechanical foundations for their interpretations .",
    "ss2 is a playground for the hanle effect , but the underlying physics is complex and still not fully understood . a modern atlas of ss2 has been produced by @xcite and is now available both in pdf and data format at + http://www.irsol.ch/data_archive/#ss2 .",
    "figure [ fig : ss2 ] gives an example of ss2 around the k and h lines of ionized calcium , to indicate the nature of some of the phenomena that we encounter in ss2 .",
    "the nearly 200  wide section shown in the double panel to the upper left was recorded in 1978 @xcite .",
    "the upper panel shows ss1 ( the intensity spectrum ) with the two dominating caii resonance lines , whose extended damping wings form a quasi - continuum that is populated by a multitude of blend lines .",
    "the strange shape of the ss2 spectrum in the panel below is a signature of quantum - mechanical interference between the @xmath12 and 3/2 upper states of the h and k lines @xcite , as indicated in the diagram to the upper right .",
    "the intermediate state of the coherent scattering process represents a `` schrdinger cat state '' , a coherent superposition of states having different total angular momenta .",
    "the resulting quantum interference is responsible for the sign reversal of ss2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ss2 ] .",
    "although major ss2 features like those of the h and k lines in the upper part of fig .  [ fig : ss2 ] could be uncovered with the kitt peak observations in 1978 , the polarimetric precision that could be achieved was not much better than 0.1% , far insufficient for most of the ss2 .",
    "it was only with the introduction of the zimpol ( zurich imaging polarimeter ) technology in the mid 1990s that the full wealth of spectral structures in ss2 became accessible to exploration .",
    "with zimpol at kitt peak we could routinely reach a polarimetric precision better than @xmath8 in combination with high spectral resolution . the lower half of fig .",
    "[ fig : ss2 ] illustrates how this allowed us to zoom in on any small spectral section to expose the new world of polarization phenomena .",
    "the zimpol technology , which was invented by hanspeter povel at eth zurich @xcite , revolutionized imaging polarimetry by achieving a polarimetric precision nearly two orders of magnitude better than other imaging systems .",
    "this opened a window to polarization physics that had not been accessible before .",
    "the problem had been that the available 2-d electronic detectors of ccd type have slow readout , which seemed incompatible with the fast ( khz ) polarization modulation needed to eliminate seeing noise .",
    "if instead of modulation one would form the difference between two simultaneous images in orthogonal polarization states , the accuracy would be limited by gain - table noise , which is caused by inaccuracies in the flat - field calibration .",
    "povel s solution to eliminate these two dominating noise sources was a way to create hidden fast buffer storage areas within the ccd sensor , between which the photocharges could be cycled in synchrony with the khz polarization modulation .",
    "the second and later generations of the zimpol system have four sets of fast hidden buffers , implying that the photocharges can be cycled between four simultaneous image planes within a single ccd sensor .",
    "linear combinations between these four images give us the simultaneous images of the four stokes parameters , free from seeing and gain table noise .",
    "the technology has now been successfully used in solar research for two decades .",
    "the interpretation of the wealth of new phenomena in ss2 and the application of the hanle effect for the diagnostics of solar magnetic fields require that the fundamental quantum processes that govern the interaction between matter and radiation in magnetized media are sufficiently understood .",
    "figure [ fig : landi ] shows two of the main pioneers in the work to establish a foundation based on general principles in quantum field theory : egidio landi deglinnocenti of firenze , italy , and veronique bommier of paris .",
    "they developed the theory in terms of the density matrix formalism with irreducible tensors , treated optical pumping by solving the statistical equilibrium problem for multi - level systems with atomic polarization , and applied the theory for the diagnostics of prominence magnetic fields ( cf .",

    "one of the main applications of the hanle effect has been to diagnose the properties of magnetic flux which is hidden to the zeeman effect , because the magnetic elements are optically thin with random orientations of their field vectors . when this method was first introduced @xcite it revealed the existence of a seething ocean of microturbulent magnetic flux with field strengths in the range 10 - 100 g .",
    "the most detailed radiative - transfer modelling of this hanle depolarization effect with the use of 3-d atmospheres produced by mhd numerical simulations has led to a turbulent field strength of 60 g if a single - valued field is assumed ( @xmath13 function pdf ) . with a more realistic pdf an average field strength about twice as large is obtained @xcite .",
    "the 60 g value should therefore be considered as a lower limit .",
    "so much volume - filling flux in the optically thin scale range is not compatible with the standard kolmogorov - type @xmath14 power law ( dashed line at high wave numbers in fig .",
    "[ fig : enspec ] ) .",
    "the energy spectrum needs to be substantially elevated and flatter to be compatible with the hanle observational constraints , which are best satisfied with the @xmath15 power law that is illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : enspec ] .",
    "such an elevated spectrum can not be explained in terms of the ordinary turbulent cascade from larger to smaller scales , there is a need for a new source of flux at small scales .",
    "this source could be provided by a local dynamo .",
    "while observations at resolved scales rule out a significant contribution from a local dynamo @xcite , such dynamo action appears to be needed for consistency with the hanle constraints .",
    "current research on solar magnetic fields is very diverse , with an interplay between theory ( e.g. plasma physics , quantum field theory , polarized radiative transfer ) , observations ( ground - based or space - based , polarimetric imaging with spectrographs or narrow - band filter systems , etc . ) , technological developments ( detector and modulation systems , telescope technology , enhanced resolutions , computing power ) , and numerical simulations of magneto - convection .",
    "the present rather sketchy and personal overview has focused on some highlights that have advanced our empirical view of solar magnetic fields since the time of hale .",
    "it is unavoidable that many of the important contributions to the field have not been covered here , because it is far beyond the scope of the present overview to aim for a comprehensive historical account .",
    "hale opened a new window to the universe by applying the physical effect discovered by pieter zeeman a decade before @xcite .",
    "a new polarimetric window has now been opened , although with much delay , by applying the physical effect discovered by wilhelm hanle at the time when quantum mechanics was being formulated in gttingen @xcite .",
    "the complexity of all the coherence phenomena has led to a return to an exploration of the fundamental quantum nature of matter - radiation interactions in magnetized media .",
    "this work is still ongoing .",
    "in contrast the non - coherent zeeman - effect physics is well understood .",
    "the problems when applying it to the sun arise because we sample an inhomogeneous medium in which the physical parameters vary over regions that are not resolved .",
    "even if we could observe with infinite angular resolution , the spatial sampling along the line of sight remains about 100 km , since this is the typical depth of line formation .",
    "this is more than three orders of magnitude larger than the small - scale end of the magnetic energy spectrum .",
    "one may in principle improve the resolution along the line of sight by using combinations of spectral lines , whose contribution functions are slightly shifted relative to each other , but this improvement can hardly exceed one order of magnitude . therefore the observed quantities will always represent ensemble averages over distributions of unresolved structures .",
    "the diagnostics of the intrinsic properties of the elements that make up such ensembles is a formidable challenge .",
    "it is however a challenge that non - solar astronomers are well familiar with , since for much more distant objects nobody can be misled to believe that the physical structures are resolved .",
    "it is therefore obvious that the history of solar magnetic field observations will not come to an end point any time soon . as much else in science",
    "it is an open - ended enterprise .",
    "the past history has seen many spectacular advances , which have given us insights about the role played by magnetic fields not only in the sun but throughout the universe .",
    "the deepened understanding has led to new questions that could not be contemplated at the time of hale .",
    "the future exploration of these questions on the sun will continue to fertilize the rest of astrophysics ."
