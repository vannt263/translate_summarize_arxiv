    "binary stars present a unique laboratory for the study of stellar evolution , as their orbital solutions give direct mass estimates .",
    "though the mass of a star is the most fundamental parameter in determining its course of evolution , very few pms stars have dynamically determined masses . in these few cases , astrometric and spectroscopic studies",
    "have lead to pms mass determinations based on the orbital motion of a stellar companion or a circumstellar disk relative to the primary star ( e.g. ghez et al .",

    "once measured , these masses can subsequently be used to constrain pms evolutionary models .",
    "these models have been shown to be systematically discrepant in their predictions by up to factors of two in mass and ten in age - still , since there are so few well - determined pms masses , little can currently be done to calibrate these tracks .",
    "this is particularly true in the lowest mass regime , where only three systems have total dynamical masses of less than 1m@xmath2 and only one single star has a dynamical mass measurement below 0.5@xmath5 ( hillenbrand @xmath6 white 2004 ) .",
    "this study is part of an ongoing program to astrometrically determine the orbits of pms stars and to help constrain these theoretical mass tracks .",
    "young stars are particularly important to correctly calibrate , as this calibration will aid in the subsequent calibration of young brown dwarf and planetary models .",
    "the tw hydrae association was originally discovered by kastner et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , with only five members confirmed at that time . since its discovery ,",
    "25 total members have been identified ( e.g. , song et al .",
    "2003 , makarov @xmath6 fabricius 2001 ) .",
    "the association has been shown to be quite young ( @xmath78 - 12 myr ) via lithium abundance tests , space motions , and placement of its members on the hr diagram ( e.g. , zuckerman @xmath6 song 2004 ) .",
    "additionally , tw hydrae is quite nearby , with an average distance of @xmath750 pc ( e.g. , makarov @xmath6 fabricius 2001 , mamajek 2005 ) .",
    "this makes tw hydrae one of the closest associations of young stars to the earth and thus is an ideal region for studying spatially resolved pms binaries , as they are likely to have orbital periods as short as a few years .    with these ideas in mind",
    ", we began to monitor twa 5 , the fifth of the five original members of the tw hydrae association identified by kastner et al .",
    "twa 5 is composed of at least three components .",
    "the pair that we analyze here is twa 5aa - ab , which had a separation of @xmath70@xmath106 when it was discovered by macintosh et al .",

    "1996 ) roughly once a year from 2001 to 2005 ( see table 1 for exact dates ) . in its high angular resolution mode",
    ", nirc has a pixel scale of 20.44 @xmath0 0.03",
    "mas / pixel ( see appendix a for details of nirc s pixel scale and orientation ) . three to four stacks of 190 images , each 0.137 seconds long , were obtained through the k band - pass filter ( @xmath10 = 2.2 @xmath11 m , @xmath12 = 0.4 @xmath11 m ) .",
    "they were taken in stationary mode , meaning the keck pupil is fixed with respect to the detector during the observations , but the sky rotates .",
    "the rotation rate is sufficiently slow that it is negligible for individual exposures , but not over the entire stack .",
    "stacks of four dark frames were also taken with each object stack .",
    "additionally , identical stacks of a point source calibrator star ( twa 1 for 2001 - 2002 observations , twa 7 for 2003 - 2005 observations ) and an empty portion of sky were obtained immediately before or after the target stacks .",
    "the stacks are processed using image reduction and speckle data anaylsis techniques .",
    "specifically , each image is first dark and sky subtracted , flat fielded , and bad pixels repaired .",
    "the images are then individually corrected for a minor optical distortion in the nirc camera ( j. lu et al . in prep ) .",
    "the object , calibrator , and sky stacks are then fourier transformed and squared to obtain stacks of power spectra .",
    "next , the calibrator stacks and sky stacks are each averaged together ( without rotation ) .",
    "the extraction of the object s intrinsic power spectra utilizes the convolution theorem , which gives the relation : @xmath13 where o is the object power spectrum , i is the initial squared fourier transform of the object , @xmath14s@xmath15 is the averaged , squared power spectrum of the sky , and @xmath14c@xmath15 is the averaged , squared power spectrum of the calibrator .",
    "each power spectrum of the object is then rotated so that north is up ; these rotated power spectra are combined to obtain an average power spectrum for the stack .",
    "finally , those individual stacks were also averaged together to produce a final power spectrum .",
    "this sequence is necessary due to the lack of azimuthal symmetry of the keck i pupil .",
    "since a binary star in the image domain is essentially two delta functions , the power spectra can be approximated as a sinusoid with the functional form : @xmath16 where r is the flux ratio of the binary star and @xmath17 is the vector separation of the two stars .",
    "this function is fit to our two - dimensional power spectra over all spatial frequencies from 2.68 arcsec@xmath18 to 17.6 arcsec@xmath18 ( this procedure is described in detail in ghez et al .",
    "the lower cutoff is imposed to avoid spatial frequencies that are corrupted by small changes in the atmospheric conditions between the object and the calibrator , whereas the upper cutoff is imposed to reject excess noise at the highest spatial frequencies .",
    "this fitting procedure gives a very accurate estimate of the binary star s separation and flux ratio for components separated by more than @xmath19/2d , leaving only a 180@xmath20 position angle ambiguity .",
    "this ambiguity is resolved by reanalyzing the original images using the method of shift and add .",
    "the brightest speckle in the speckle cloud in each image of the stack is shifted to a common position , and then all the images are added together to produce a diffration - limited core surrounded by a large , diffuse halo .",
    "these images allow us to determine the correct orientation of the position angles of twa 5a . in one epoch ( 2002 ) ,",
    "the binary separation was less than @xmath19/2d , and hence the first minimum of the power spectrum was not measured ; without this measurement , the separation and the flux ratio are degenerate .",
    "for this epoch , we fix the flux ratio to the weighted average of the k - band flux ratio measurements of all the other epochs and fit only the separation , as there is no evidence of statistically significant photometric variability over the course of our observations .",
    "uncertainties for all parameters are determined by fitting each of the individual , stack - averaged images that contribute to the final image by the same procedure , and then taking the rms of those values with respect to the average value ; for the 2002 epoch we also account for the uncertainty in the weighted - average flux ratio , which is taken to be the rms of the individual k - band flux ratio measurements at all other epochs .",
    "twa 5aab was also observed using the keck ii 10 m telescope with the ao system ( wizinowich et al .",

    ", in prep ) .",
    "in february , five images , each of 0.2 second exposure time and 30 coadds , were taken through the feii narrow band pass filter ( @xmath10 = 1.65 @xmath11 m , @xmath12 = 0.03 @xmath11 m ) . in december",

    "these images were processed using the same standard data reduction techniques listed above , and then shifted and combined to produce a final image .",
    "astrometry and flux ratios were then obtained using the idl package starfinder ( diolaiti et al .",
    "the wide brown dwarf companion to the system , twa 5b , was visible in all ao images taken and thus was used as the empirical point - spread function required by the starfinder fitting algorithm .",
    "both components of the close binary were successfully fit by starfinder in all cases .",

    "our model incorporates the following 7 standard orbital elements : p ( period ) , a ( semi - major axis ) , e ( eccentricity ) , i ( inclination ) , t@xmath22 ( time of periapse passage ) , @xmath23 ( longitude of the ascending node ) , and @xmath24 ( argument of pericenter ) . with nine two - dimensional astrometric measurements , there are eleven degrees of freedom in our fit .",

    "model estimates of mass and age require both effective temperature and bolometric luminosity as inputs .",
    "effective temperatures are estimated from the unresolved spectral type for twa 5a and component flux ratios . the photometric analysis performed here and elsewhere ( see table 1 ) shows that the two components of twa 5a have nearly equal brightness out to 1.6 @xmath11 m .",
    "we therefore assume that the components have the same spectral type and assign it to be m1.5 @xmath0 0.5 , the spectral type found from a spatially unresolved spectrum ( webb et al . 1999 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the j - h colors for each component , which are calculated by combining the 2mass unresolved magnitudes with the flux ratios measured here ( j - h[m1.5 ] = 0.67 ; leggett et al . 1992 ) .",
    "we estimate the temperature of these components using a conversion of spectral type to effective temperature given in luhman et al .",
    "these temperatures are intermediate between dwarf and giant stars , thus making them appropriate for pms stars like twa 5a .",
    "bolometric luminosities are estimated using our h band magnitudes and the corresponding h band bolometric corrections for pms stars ( luhman 2005 , private communication ) , along with the kinematic distance for twa 5a of 44 @xmath0 4 pc ( mamajek 2005 ) .",
    "these input values are given in table 3 .",
    "the uncertainties in m/ ( d/44 pc)@xmath3 and age from each model are estimated through monte carlo simulations .",
    "our monte carlo simulation was run with @xmath27 points sampled from random , independent gaussian distributions of h - band flux densities and flux density ratios , temperatures for each component , and distance .",
    "this allowed us to correctly account for the correlation between input values .",
    "in particular , the bolometric correction used for determining the luminosity stems from the effective temperature . additionally , the luminosities of the primary and the secondary are correlated , as they are calculated from the same parameters , namely the total flux and the flux ratios .",
    "each of of these values are converted into sets of temperatures and bolometric luminosities , which are is fed into the models to produce estimates of masses and ages for each component . using the distance assumed for each run , we convert the total mass of both components to m/ ( d/44 pc)@xmath3 .",
    "we emphasize that though the predictions of the models are clearly not independent of the distance uncertainty , by using this quantity as opposed to the total mass , we can leave the distance uncertainty out of our dynamical measurement .",
    "thus , we then generate contours that correctly represent the 1@xmath4 uncertainties on the masses and ages derived from the model tracks .",
    "figure 4 shows the dynamical mass normalized by the distance - cubed and with it the estimated age of the tw hydrae association ( 10 @xmath0 2 myr , based on comparison with the @xmath28 pictoris moving group , zuckerman @xmath6 song 2004 ) , compared with the model predictions as determined by the monte carlo simulations .",
    "while the input values are generally treated as independent variables , the monte carlo simulations demonstrate that it is important to consider the existing correlations between input values , as the resulting uncertainties are otherwise significantly underestimated ( by up to a factor of five depending upon the model ) . with this proper treatment ,",
    "the dynamical mass and age estimates are within 2@xmath4 of all five tracks .",
    "while it is reassuring that current models agree with these measurements , we are unable to distinguish between the model tracks .",
    "future improvements in the precision of both the distance and the temperature would allow for a more illuminating comparison between the theoretical models .",
    "the temperature uncertainties on the components of twa 5a could be substantially reduced with spatially resolved spectral types , which should drive the uncertainty in the temperature down to @xmath0 one quarter of a spectral subclass .",
    "uncertainties in the distance could also be substantially reduced .",
    "typical uncertainties in new parallax measurements are on the order of a few milliarcseconds , with improvements on these results promised in the near future ( vrba et al .",
    "2004 ) . a separate method to determine",
    "the distance is the addition of spatially resolved radial velocities , which would allow an independent distance estimate from the orbital parameters . in principle , a factor of two improvement in the distance uncertainty could be achieved .",
    "these radial velocity measurements would also improve the total mass estimate , as would additional astrometric measurements , and would also eventually allow for the determination of _ individual _ masses of each of the components .",
    "however a potential complication is the possible existence of an additional component in the system ( torres et al .",
    "another possible method of determining the individual masses of the components of twa 5a is to use absolute astrometry with respect to twa 5b , as was done recently for t tau s ( duchne et al . 2006 ) .",
    "if we just take the improvements expected from future parallax measurements , spatially resolved spectra , and additional astrometry , we expect to be able to distinguish between the tracks at the @xmath73@xmath4 level .",
    "future spatially resolved spectral types would also address the marginal inconsistency between the j - h and h - k colors for the primary .",
    "currently , we have assumed that this arises from a small k - band excess ( 2@xmath4 ) .",
    "torres et al .",
    "( 2003 ) suggest that an additional component may be present in the system . if this component were particularly low mass , it could give rise to the apparent k band excess of the primary .",
    "alternatively , the infrared excess could arise from circumstellar material .",
    "mohanty et al . ( 2003 ) report the detection of strong h@xmath26 emission in an unresolved , high resolution spectrum of twa 5a , implying at least one of the components is accreting .",
    "however , no mid - infrared excess has been detected in unresolved measurements .",
    "given the tightness of the twa 5a binary , any disk material is likely to be localized to a very radially thin reservoir of material near the dust sublimation radius . in either case ,",
    "disk or low mass companion , the cause of the infrared excess should not have a large impact on the track comparison , as the comparison was performed at h - band , where the luminosities do not appear to be significantly effected by this excess .    in summary , our solution to the orbit of this system and the subsequent determination of its mass shows that these young , nearby associations of stars are excellent laboratories for the study of low - mass star formation",
    "there are likely other systems in tw hydrae with similar close companions that will yield more mass estimates within a short time , much like we have seen here .",
    "thus monitoring of these systems will greatly aid in the constraint of pms mass tracks in the near future .",
