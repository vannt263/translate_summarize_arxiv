    "the multitype contact process introduced in @xcite is a continuous - time markov process whose state space maps the @xmath0-dimensional integer lattice into the set @xmath1 where state 0 refers to empty sites and where state @xmath2 , @xmath3 , refers to sites occupied by a type @xmath2 particle .",
    "denoting by @xmath4 the state of the system at time @xmath5 and by @xmath6 the binary relation indicating that two vertices are nearest neighbors , the evolution of the process at vertex @xmath7 is described by the transition rates @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the rate at which the state of @xmath7 flips from @xmath2 to @xmath10 .",
    "that is , type @xmath2 particles give birth through the edges of the lattice to particles of their own type at rate @xmath11 and die spontaneously at death rate @xmath12 .",
    "if an offspring is sent to a site already occupied , the birth is suppressed .",
    "the multitype contact process has been introduced and completely studied when the death rates are equal by neuhauser @xcite . to fix the time scale , assume that @xmath13 , and to leave out trivialities , assume in addition that the birth rates are greater than the critical value of the basic contact process @xcite .",
    "then , the type with the highest birth rate outcompetes the other type . in the neutral case",
    "when the birth rates are equal , the process clusters in dimension @xmath14 while coexistence occurs in dimension @xmath15 . here and after , coexistence means strong coexistence : there exists a stationary distribution with a positive density of type 1 and type 2 .",
    "the long - term behavior of the process when the death rates are different remains an open problem but neuhauser conjectured that her results extend to the general case provided one replaces the birth rate by the ratio of the birth rate to the death rate .",
    "in particular , it is believed that the coexistence region as a subset of the space of the parameters has lebesgue measure zero .",
    "the existence of such a coexistence region is mathematically interesting but for obvious reasons it is irrelevant to explain why species coexist in nature . in order to identify mechanisms ( more meaningful for biologists ) that promote coexistence ,",
    "recent studies have focused on modifications of the multitype contact process in which the coexistence region contains an open set of the parameters .",
    "it has been proved in different contexts that coexistence is promoted by spatial @xcite and temporal @xcite heterogeneities .",
    "this article introduces the first example of a multitype contact process in which coexistence is produced by the geometry of the graph on which particles evolve . in some sense ,",
    "our main result is analogous to the one of pemantle @xcite which states that , in contrast with the contact process on the regular lattice , the contact process on homogeneous trees exhibits a phase of weak survival . in both cases ,",
    "the geometry of the graph is responsible for creating new qualitative behaviors .    to construct our process , we consider the @xmath0-dimensional lattice @xmath16 as a homogeneous graph with degree @xmath17 where vertices are connected to each of their @xmath17 nearest neighbors .",
    "let @xmath18 be an odd positive integer .",
    "then , we consider the following collection of hyperplanes : @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the @xmath2th coordinate of @xmath7 , and remove from the original graph all the edges that intersect one of these hyperplanes .",
    "this induces a partition of the lattice into @xmath0-dimensional cubes with length edge @xmath18 that we call _",
    "patches_. see the left - hand side of figure [ fig : graph ] for an illustration where edges drawn in dotted lines are the edges to be removed . since the parameter @xmath18 is odd",
    ", each patch has a central vertex . to complete the construction ,",
    "we draw a long edge between the centers of adjacent patches as indicated in the right - hand side of figure [ fig : graph ] .",
    "the resulting graph can be seen as the superposition of two lattices that we call _ microscopic _ and _ mesoscopic _ lattices .",
    "even though , for more convenience , we will prove all our results for this particular graph , our main coexistence result can be easily extended to more general graphs that we shall call _ two - scale graphs_. these graphs are described in details at the end of this section .    to formulate the evolution rules",
    ", we write @xmath21 to indicate that vertices @xmath7 and @xmath22 are connected by a short edge , and @xmath23 to indicate that both vertices are connected by a long edge . the evolution at vertex @xmath7",
    "is then given by the following transition rates : @xmath24 note that in the expression of @xmath25 the first sum is empty whenever vertex @xmath7 is not located at the center of a patch .",
    "we call this process the _ two - scale multitype contact process_. also , we call the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath11 the _ microscopic _ and _ mesoscopic _ birth rates . the one - color version of this process has been introduced by belhadji and lanchier @xcite as a spatially explicit model of metapopulation @xcite . the objective there was to determine parameter values for which survival occurs .",
    "in contrast , the emphasis here is on whether both types coexist or one type outcompetes the other type .",
    "while our analysis of the single - species model in @xcite did not reveal any major difference between the contact processes on regular lattices and the graph of figure [ fig : graph ] , our analysis of the multispecies model shows that two - scale graphs , as opposed to regular lattices , promote the coexistence of the species . from now on",
    ", we assume that the parameters are chosen in such a way that each type survives in the absence of the other one and refer to @xcite for explicit conditions of survival .",
    "finally , note that when @xmath27 , i.e. , patches reduce to a single vertex , the values of the microscopic birth rates are irrelevant and the two - scale multitype contact process reduces to the multitype contact process .",
    "therefore , to avoid trivialities , we also assume that @xmath28 .",
    "we call the best _ invader _ the type with the highest @xmath11 to @xmath12 ratio , and the best _ competitor _ the type with the highest @xmath26 to @xmath12 ratio .",
    "our first theorem extends neuhauser s result to the two - scale multitype contact process : assuming that the death rates are equal , when one type is both the best invader and the best competitor , it outcompetes the other type except in the neutral case when the process clusters in @xmath14 and coexistence occurs in @xmath15 .",
    "see figure [ fig : m2cp ] for pictures of numerical simulations in the two dimensional neutral case .",
    "[ duality ] assume that @xmath29 and @xmath30 .    1 .",
    "in the neutral case @xmath31 and @xmath32 we have the following alternative .",
    "1 .   in @xmath14 clustering occurs , i.e. , for any initial configuration , @xmath33 2 .   in @xmath15 coexistence occurs , i.e. , there exists a stationary distribution under which the density of type 1 and the density of type 2 are both positive .",
    "2 .   if @xmath29 and @xmath30 with at least one strict inequality then type 2 wins .    to search for strategies promoting coexistence",
    ", we now assume that one type , say type 1 , is the best invader , and the other type is the best competitor , in which case the limiting behavior of the process is more difficult to predict .",
    "interestingly , while the results of theorem [ duality ] are not sensitive to the patch size , the long - term behavior of the process under these new assumptions strongly depends upon the parameter @xmath18 . as mentioned above , when patches reduce to a single vertex , the values of the microscopic birth rates are irrelevant so that type 1 particles outcompete type 2 particles as predicted by theorem 1 in @xcite .",
    "in contrast , taking @xmath18 large leaves enough room for type 2 to outcompete locally type 1 within each patch , except maybe near the central vertices located on the mesoscopic lattice . the time a colony of type 2 particles persists within a single patch is long enough so that survival of type 2 is insured by casual migrations from one patch to another , which is referred to as the _ rescue effect _ in metapopulation theory . in conclusion ,",
    "large patches promote survival of the best competitor , as indicated in the following theorem .",
    "[ survival ] assume that @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "then , in any dimension , type 2 survives provided the spatial scale @xmath18 is sufficiently large .",
    "theorem [ survival ] is the key result to identify a set of parameters for which coexistence occurs .",
    "first of all , we fix the parameter values to make type 1 a good invader but a bad competitor living at a slow time scale .",
    "type 1 then survives by jumping from patch to patch , or equivalently by invading the mesoscopic lattice .",
    "this holds regardless of the patch size .",
    "coexistence of both types then follows from the proof of theorem [ survival ] by fixing the remaining parameters to make type 2 a good competitor living at a much faster time scale than type 1 and taking @xmath18 large ( which does not affect survival of type 2 ) . to prove rigorously survival of both types ,",
    "the two - scale multitype contact process will be simultaneously coupled with two different oriented percolation processes , one following the evolution of type 1 at a certain time scale , the other one following the evolution of type 2 at a slower time scale .",
    "the use of a block construction implies the existence of an open set of the parameters in which coexistence occurs , so we can conclude that    [ coexistence ] in any dimension , the lebesgue measure of the coexistence region is strictly positive provided the spatial scale @xmath18 is sufficiently large .",
    "as previously mentioned , theorem [ coexistence ] together with neuhauser s conjecture @xcite indicates that , in contrast to the regular lattice , the graph of figure [ fig : graph ] promotes coexistence for the multitype contact process .",
    "thinking of the competitive exclusion principle in ecology ( the number of coexisting species at equilibrium can not exceed the number of resources ) , this suggests that the two - scale graph provides two spatial resources , namely the microscopic and the mesoscopic lattices , which allows two types to coexist .",
    "note also that , while the coexistence region of the neuhauser s competing model corresponds to the neutral case , for the two - scale multitype contact process , the coexistence region contains cases in which type 1 and type 2 have opposite strategies , namely one type is a good invader exploiting the mesoscopic lattice , while the other type is a good competitor using the microscopic lattice as its primary resource , and both types live at different time scales .",
    "finally , even through for simplicity we will prove theorems [ survival ] and [ coexistence ] only for the two - scale graph depicted in figure [ fig : graph ] , we would like to point out that our proofs easily extend to more general graphs , which also gives rise to realistic stochastic spatial models of disease dynamics .",
    "we first describe the general mathematical framework in which our results can be extended and then discuss about the relevance of this framework from a biological point of view . to begin with ,",
    "let @xmath36 be two infinite graphs .",
    "we call @xmath37 the microscopic graph and @xmath38 the mesoscopic graph , and consider the two - scale contact process evolving on the graph @xmath39 where species @xmath2 gives birth through the edges of the microscopic graph at rate @xmath26 and through the edges of the mesoscopic graph at rate @xmath11",
    ". assume that we have the following property that we call _ separation of the space scales_. the mesoscopic graph @xmath38 contains a self - avoiding path @xmath40 such that    1 .   for all @xmath41",
    ", @xmath37 contains a self - avoiding path of length at least @xmath18 containing @xmath42 .",
    "2 .   for all @xmath43 , the shortest path in @xmath37 connecting @xmath7 and @xmath22 has length at least @xmath18 .    if there is no path in @xmath37 connecting @xmath7 and @xmath22 ( note that this is the case for the two - scale graph depicted in figure [ fig : graph ] ) we assume by convention that both vertices are connected by a path of infinite length so condition 2 above holds .",
    "then , our proof of theorem [ coexistence ] implies that , for the two - scale multitype contact process evolving on @xmath44 , the lebesgue measure of the coexistence region is strictly positive provided @xmath18 is sufficiently large .",
    "note that , when @xmath37 is a connected graph , condition 1 above is always satisfied .",
    "in particular , a natural way to construct a suitable graph @xmath44 is to start from an infinite connected graph @xmath37 , then select an infinite subset @xmath45 of vertices that are at least distance @xmath18 from each other , and finally add enough edges between the vertices in @xmath46 to obtain a mesoscopic graph @xmath38 with at least one infinite self - avoiding path .",
    "returning to a microscopic graph made of infinitely many finite connected components and thinking of each component as a patch , one can legitimately argue that if two patches are connected by an edge of the mesoscopic structure then all the vertices of one patch should be connected to all the vertices of the other patch by a mesoscopic edge . in a number of contexts , however , patches are arbitrarily large yet adjacent patches are connected through only few vertices , in which case our general framework can capture the main features of the dynamics . this is the case , for instance , in metastatic diseases , such as malignant tumor cells that first spread within a given organ for a long time and then infect quickly other organs while reaching the bloodstream . in this context ,",
    "the connected components of the microscopic structure represent organs or parts of the organs of the human body and the mesoscopic structure the vascular system . in a different context",
    ", one can think of the microscopic structure as a set of major cities and the mesoscopic structure as an airline network , where two types of diseases spread : one highly infectious disease such as h1n1 influenza that spreads quickly through the microscopic structure but slowly through the mesoscopic one due to airport screenings ( best competitor ) , and one moderately infectious disease that spreads at an equal speed through the whole structure of the network ( best invader ) .",
    "theorem [ duality ] has been proved by neuhauser @xcite for the multitype contact process on the regular lattice , which corresponds to the case @xmath27 for our process .",
    "her proof relies on duality .",
    "thinking of the process as being generated by a graphical representation , the dual process of the multitype contact process starting at a space - time point @xmath47 exhibits a tree structure that induces an ancestor hierarchy in which the ancestors are arranged according to the order they determine the type of the particle at @xmath47 .",
    "her result follows from the existence of a sequence of renewal points dividing the path of the first ancestor into independent and identically distributed pieces , as stated in details in proposition [ neuhauser ] below .    similarly , the two - scale contact process is self - dual and the dual process exhibits a tree structure that allows us to identify a first ancestor .",
    "renewal points can be defined from the topology of the dual process by using the same algorithm as for the multitype contact process . however , since the graph on which the particles compete is not homogeneous , the space - time displacements between consecutive renewal points are no longer identically distributed .",
    "the key to our proof is to rely on the fact that the graph of figure [ fig : graph ] is invariant by translation of vector @xmath48 to show the existence of a subsequence of renewal points performing a random walk .    to define the dual process",
    ", we first use an idea of harris @xcite to construct the two - scale contact process graphically from collections of independent poisson processes .",
    "these processes are defined for each directed edge @xmath49 or vertex @xmath7 as indicated in table [ tab-1 ] .",
    "the last two columns show the rate of the poisson processes and the symbols used to construct the graphical representation , respectively .",
    "unlabeled arrows from @xmath7 to @xmath22 indicate birth events : provided site @xmath7 is occupied and site @xmath22 empty , @xmath22 becomes occupied by a particle of the same type as the one at @xmath7 .",
    "the same holds for type 2 arrows if the particle at site @xmath7 is of type 2 , but these arrows are forbidden for type 1 particles , which takes into account the selective advantage of type 2 .",
    "finally , a @xmath50 at site @xmath7 indicates that a particle of either type at this site is killed .",
    "this graphical representation allows to construct the two - scale multitype contact process starting from any initial configuration .",
    "the proof of lemma [ invasion ] relies on duality techniques as well .",
    "in order to define the dual process , the first step is to construct the multitype contact process on @xmath51 graphically from collections of independent poisson processes @xcite .",
    "as indicated in table [ tab-2 ] , these processes are defined for each directed edge @xmath52 or vertex @xmath53 .",
    "unlabeled arrows , type 2 arrows , and @xmath50 s have the same interpretation as in table [ tab-1 ] above .",
    "the additional symbol @xmath54 indicates a spontaneous birth of type 1 particle at site 0 .",
    "this graphical representation allows us to construct the multitype contact process on @xmath51 starting from any initial configuration .",

    "the dual process starting at space - time point @xmath47 is then defined as the set - valued process @xmath63 as previously , it is convenient to assume that the poisson processes in the graphical representation are defined for negative times so that the dual process is defined for all @xmath64 . to deduce the type of the particle at @xmath47 from the configuration at earlier times ,",
    "we define a labeling of the tree structure of the dual process , thus inducing an ancestor hierarchy , by using the algorithm introduced in section [ sec : duality ] .",

    "the strategy of our proof is as follows .",
    "first of all , we establish coexistence for a particular point of the space of the parameters by comparing the process with 1-dependent oriented percolation .",
    "interestingly , survival of type 1 and survival of type 2 are proved by considering different time scales . in other words ,",
    "the process will be simultaneously coupled with two different oriented percolation processes , one following the evolution of type 1 particles at a certain time scale , the other one following the evolution of type 2 particles at a slower time scale . the suitable time scale for type 2",

    "since our proof relies on a block construction , standard perturbation arguments imply that the coexistence region can be extended to an open set containing the coexistence point , which proves theorem [ coexistence ] . in order to compare the process with oriented percolation",
    ", we introduce the following definition .          note that the definition of type 2 stable is slightly different from the one in definition [ 2-stable ] in that it now applies to events related to the two - scale multitype contact process instead of the modified process introduced in section [ sec : survival ]",
    ". however , proposition [ coupling_2 ] still holds for @xmath266 since the set of 2 s in the two - scale multitype contact process dominates the set of 2 s in the modified process . to exhibit a point of the space of the parameters at",
    "which coexistence occurs , we fix @xmath267 the condition @xmath268 is to fix the time scale .",
    "the condition @xmath269 indicates that type 1 particles can only survive by jumping from patch to patch . in particular , to prove that they survive , the idea is to choose @xmath270 so small that a 1 at the center of a patch can produce and send its offspring to adjacent patches before being killed . more importantly , since @xmath269 , survival of type 1 particles does not depend on the patch size .",
    "coexistence is then obtained by choosing @xmath18 so large that type 2 particles can establish themselves an arbitrarily long time in a single patch .",
    "since type 1 particles have a positive death rate , centers of patches are empty a positive fraction of time which allows type 2 particles to survive by invading adjacent patches from time to time .",
    "[ coupling_3 ] assume .",
    "then , for suitable @xmath271 , @xmath270 and @xmath272 , the processes can be constructed on the same probability space in such a way that @xmath273 where @xmath274 and @xmath275 are two copies of @xmath276 .    as in proposition",
    "[ coupling_2 ] , it suffices to prove that , for @xmath3 , @xmath277 for a suitable choice of the parameters .",

    "survival of type 1 particles holds regardless of the patch size so the proof that conditions for @xmath287 and @xmath288 hold _ simultaneously _ for the same parameters follows by taking @xmath72 and @xmath150 sufficiently large , and applying the results of the previous two sections .",
    "this proves that both types coexist .",
    "to conclude , we briefly justify the fact that the results of the previous sections hold as well under the new assumptions @xmath289 first , the condition @xmath269 implies that , starting from any initial configuration , @xmath290 which , now that @xmath270 is fixed , can be made arbitrarily small by taking @xmath72 large . in words , except at the center of the patch , all the 1 s in @xmath291 are rapidly killed , so the proof of lemma [ invasion ] extends easily under .",
    "proposition [ coupling_1 ] and lemma [ time ] follow as well .",
    "now , we observe that the condition @xmath270 implies that vertex 0 is empty a positive fraction of time , which allows for invasions of particles of type 2 at the center of the patch . with this in mind",
    ", one can check easily that the proofs of lemmas [ center ] and [ occupation ] also apply under the assumptions .",
    "note however that the new lower bound @xmath189 in lemma [ center ] might be smaller .",
