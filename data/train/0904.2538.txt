    "the transport of suspended particles in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) periodic periodic lattice of obstacles has recently attracted significant attention as a means of separating particle species in microfluidic devices .",
    "a driving force induces particles to move through the system . depending on the properties of the particles and the direction of the driving force @xmath0 with respect to the lattice orientation , the particles move through the lattice in commensurate phase - locked trajectories .",
    "that is , for a range of driving - force angles single species of particles will have an average trajectory in one of the lattice directions @xmath1 $ ] , whose angle is given by @xmath2 .",
    "further , that average trajectory angle will remain fixed over a range of driving - force angles .",
    "when the driving - force angle is outside that range , the particle trajectories will jump to a new fixed angle .",
    "the relation between the direction of motion @xmath3 and the angle of the driving force @xmath0 depends on the properties of the particles .",
    "consequently , the system has the potential to separate different species of particles , with the advantage that different particles migrate at different angles ( _ vector chromatography _ ) , allowing for continuous fractionation @xcite .",
    "these microfluidic systems can be broadly classified into two groups , depending on the nature of the energy landscape that is experienced by the suspended particles . in one group ,",
    "the particles move through a periodic array of solid obstacles , such as in the separation devices based on _ deterministic hydrodynamics _ pioneered by austin s group @xcite . in terms of the corresponding energy landscape , the array of obstacles can be considered as a periodic array of _ hard - core _ repulsive potentials . in the second class of systems ,",
    "particles move through smooth potential landscapes , with _ soft _ interactions between the particles and an external field .",
    "examples include the optical fractionation methods pioneered by grier s group , where colloidal particles are transported through an array of holographic optical tweezers @xcite .",
    "phase - locking behavior is common to transport through periodic structures in many systems @xcite as well as to non - linear dynamical systems in general @xcite . in the transport of particles in periodic systems , @xcite studied a 2d periodic arrangement of wells ( or traps ) in a square lattice by means of numerical simulations of the corresponding langevin equation .",
    "numerical results showed the presence of periodic trajectories and lateral migration , in that the particles moved , on average , at an angle @xmath3 different from the orientation angle of the driving force @xmath0 .",
    "they also showed the presence of phase locking in the @xmath3 vs. @xmath0 curve , with clear plateaus at large peclet numbers .",
    "in fact , the authors identify the observed migration as a deterministic phenomenon @xcite .    in a separate study , @xcite investigated periodic landscapes that present either repulsive ( obstacles ) or attractive ( traps ) centers located on a square lattice . in both repulsive and attractive cases",
    ", they observe similar phase locking behavior , with the corresponding plateaus in the @xmath3 vs. @xmath0 curve becoming evident at large peclet numbers ( large peclet numbers corresponds to low temperatures in refs . @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , separable potentials , which can be written as a sum of periodic fields in each of the two principal directions of a square lattice @xcite , do not exhibit the same complex behavior , as clearly shown by @xcite .",
    "experimental work using optical tweezers has also demonstrated the presence of periodic trajectories and locked - in states @xcite .",
    "however , these experiments displayed a different type of locking in the presence of brownian motion , in which the trajectories become commensurate only in a statistical sense and only some of the locked - in states are centered on commensurate directions ( a hopping model for the observed dynamics is proposed by @xcite ) .",
    "conversely , and in agreement with the discussed numerical results at high peclet numbers , recent simulations and experiments on the motion of non - brownian spherical particles through periodic arrays of obstacles clearly show that deterministic systems exhibit analogous phase - locking dynamics and periodic trajectories into commensurate lattice directions @xcite .",
    "phase - locking dynamics has also been observed in more complex transport systems , including the motion of an overdamped particle through a periodic potential under time - periodic driving forces @xcite and the dynamics of a particle driven through a deformable colloidal lattice @xcite .",
    "in contrast to a significant number of experiments and simulations , there are few studies that present analytical results for the transport of particles in irreducible two - dimensional systems .",
    "@xcite studied the overdamped motion of a single particle in a periodic landscape . in the 1d case ( linear fringes )",
    "they showed the existence of locked trajectories for driving forces that are not strong enough to drive the particles over the energy barrier .",
    "they also showed that the behavior in separable ( reducible ) 2d potentials is analogous to the locking observed in 1d systems .",
    "@xcite studied irreducible 2d periodic potentials and derived an iterative method for calculating the average velocity of the particles in inverse powers of the external force and particle s diffusivity .",
    "in this work , we are interested in the deterministic limit ( small diffusivity ) for relatively small forces , _ i. e. _ , driving forces for which the effect of the potential landscape is not negligible .",
    "therefore , we consider both the deterministic evolution as well as the high peclet number limit for finite forces .",
    "in particular , we consider a quadratic , continuous model for the 2d periodic potential that corresponds to a piecewise - continuous , linear - force model .",
    "this simple model offers the interesting combination of an irreducible but solvable potential that captures the non - trivial transport phenomena exhibited by 2d periodic systems , including directional locking and the universal behavior of dynamical systems near a bifurcation point .",
    "the equation of motion for a brownian particle traversing a periodic force field is the langevin equation @xcite , which in the high - friction limit takes the form @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the periodic force field , @xmath6 is an external driving force and @xmath7 is the langevin force describing the fluctuating force exerted by the fluid on the colloidal particle . the friction constant @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the radius of the colloid and @xmath11 is the viscosity of the fluid . the langevin force is represented by a gaussian distribution with zero mean , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 correlation , @xmath14 . here",

    "we shall refer to the rotation angle between the @xmath16 axis of the coordinate system and the principal axis of the square lattice @xmath20 as the forcing angle @xmath0 ( see figure [ quadratic ] ) .",

    "we can estimate the width of the probability peak to validate that it corresponds to diffusive spreading in the direction perpendicular to the convective motion .",

    "we expect the dynamics to be similar to that in the case of solid obstacles .",
    "this is only approximate , given that in the presence of diffusion , there is a non - zero probability of finding the particles inside the repulsive regions .",
    "figure [ hard ] shows that , in fact , the migration angles obtained in our model are very similar to the migration angles obtained in the case of solid obstacles for the same , relatively large , peclet number .",
    "in experimental work , it has been shown the possibility to separate particles using differences in the value of the bifurcation angle .",
    "in dimensional variables , the bifurcation angle is given by @xmath146 , which shows its dependence on the properties of the particles .",
    "specifically , the properties of the particles could come into play through the force ratio @xmath147 or through the effective size of the repulsive centers @xmath24 .    in the case of optical lattices , both the magnitude of the repulsive force as well as the characteristic size of the repulsive centers depend on the particle size @xcite .",
    "in fact , our results for the bifurcation angle are analogous to the calculation by @xcite for the critical angle to escape a single barrier .",
    "our results can then be used to investigate the behavior at angles above the bifurcation .",
    "finally , we can investigate the transport of suspended particles in a pattern of solid obstacles using the limiting case @xmath144 discussed in [ limitbehavior ] .    in this case ,",
    "@xmath148 , which depends on the size of the particles through the effective size of the obstacles , @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is the size of the obstacles and @xmath10 is the radius of the particles . in this trivial approximation",
    "the bifurcation angle can also be obtained by straightforward geometrical considerations .",
    "the size dependency implies that larger particles will become unlocked from the @xmath59 direction at larger angles of the driving force , as observed in experiments .",
    "consider , for example , the separation of particles of two different sizes , @xmath151 and @xmath152 , in a lattice of ( solid ) cylindrical obstacles of radius @xmath153 and with a lattice constant @xmath154 .",
    "let us assume that the particles are driven at an average velocity of @xmath155 , which corresponds to a large value of the particles peclet number , pe@xmath156 . then , considering only hard - sphere interactions ( excluded volume effects ) between the spheres and the obstacles the corresponding effective size of the obstacles is @xmath157 and @xmath158 for particles of radius @xmath159 and @xmath160 , respectively .",
    "similarly , the dimensionless length depends on the size of the particles . specifically , @xmath161 and @xmath162 , which results in different bifurcation angles for the two type of particles , @xmath163 and @xmath164 for sizes @xmath159 and @xmath160 , respectively .",
    "therefore , for a driving force oriented at any angle @xmath0 relative to the obstacle lattice such that @xmath165 , the particles will separate .",
    "in particular , the small particles will move in the lattice direction [ 1,2 ] with @xmath166 and the large particles will be locked at @xmath167 .",
    "we have shown that the transport of particles in a periodic lattice of repulsive centers exhibits analogous behavior to that observed in microfluidic systems .",
    "the simplicity of the parabolic repulsive potentials allowed us to integrate the trajectories explicitly and showed the existence of periodic trajectories that are commensurate with the obstacle lattice .",
    "we also showed that the motion can be determined by means of a poincare map of the incoming impact parameter into itself , which shows that there is a tangent bifurcation at the critical forcing angle for which the locking becomes different from @xmath59 .",
    "the entire migration - angle vs. forcing - angle curve shows the characteristic devil s staircase type of structure common to phase - locking systems .",
    "finally , we showed that the limiting behavior for impenetrable obstacles is equivalent to the high peclet number limit in the case of transport of particles in a periodic pattern of solid obstacles .",
    "therefore , our previous results provide insight into the separation problem in the case of periodic potential landscapes as well as in the case of periodic patterns of solid obstacles . in fact , we discuss a straightforward application of our results to calculating the bifurcation angle in both solid and optical lattices .",
    "we thank r. hansen for pointing to us the farey - tree structure underlying the possible locking angles .",
    "this material is partially based upon work supported by the national science foundation under grant no ."
