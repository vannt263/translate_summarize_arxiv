    "fock and goncharov ( @xcite ) improved on previous work of faddeev , kashaev ( @xcite ) , chekhov and fock ( @xcite ) and defined new families of projective unitary representations of modular groupoids associated to cluster algebras . in the particular case of @xmath1 one obtained ( projective ) representations of the ptolemy modular groupoids associated to triangulations of surfaces , arising in the quantification of the teichmller space .",
    "the main ingredient is the quantum dilogarithm function which permits to deform the natural action of the modular groupoid on the teichmller space .",
    "thereby they will be called dilogarithmic representations . these are actually projective unitary representations , or equivalently , representations of suitable central extensions .    these representations ",
    "depending on a deformation parameter  are infinite dimensional .",
    "the general belief is that they collapse at roots of unity to finite dimensional representations which can be identified with the mapping class group representations arising from the quantum group @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , they should also coincide with the representations coming from the quantum hyperbolic invariants introduced by baseilhac and benedetti ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there exists an universal setting for these constructions where the surface is the hyperbolic plane @xmath3 ( endowed with a specific triangulation , namely the farey triangulation ) and the universal teichmller space is the one constructed by penner in @xcite .",
    "the associated modular groupoid is the ptolemy groupoid of flips on the triangulation . as it is well - known ( see @xcite )",
    "there is a group structure underlying the groupoid structure that identifies the ptolemy group of flips on the farey triangulation to the thompson group @xmath0 of piecewise-@xmath4 homeomorphisms of the circle ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our aim is to identify the central extension @xmath5 of @xmath0 arising in the dilogarithm representations constructed in ( @xcite , section 10 , @xcite , section 3 ) .",
    "we refer to @xmath5 as the dilogarithmic central extension of @xmath0 .",
    "following @xcite the cohomology ring @xmath6 is generated by two classes @xmath7 , which are called the discrete godbillon - vey class and respectively , the euler class .",
    "one can obtain @xmath8 as the euler class of the action of @xmath0 on the circle .    moreover , central extensions of @xmath0 are classified up to isomorphism by their extension classes in @xmath9 .",
    "for instance the euler class @xmath8 is the extension class of the central extension @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the group of lifts of piecewise-@xmath4 homeomorphisms of the circle to homeomorphisms of the real line @xmath12 .",
    "our first goal is the identification of the extension class of @xmath5 .",
    "specifically , our first main result is the following :    [ dilog ] the class @xmath13 of the dilogarithmic central extension @xmath5 is @xmath14 .",
    "our approach consists of relating the dilogarithmic central extension @xmath5 to the braided ptolemy - thompson group @xmath15 introduced and studied in @xcite .",
    "this will provide a description of @xmath5 by means of an explicit group presentation by generators and relations .",
    "the braided ptolemy - thompson group @xmath15 is an extension of @xmath0 by the infinite group @xmath16 of braids , which arises as a mapping class group of an infinite surface .",
    "this group is finitely presented and we are using heavily explicit presentations of related groups .",
    "we will present a rather direct proof ( using however results from @xcite ) showing that the dilogarithmic extension class is a multiple of the euler class because the extension splits over the smaller thompson group @xmath17 .",
    "this multiple is next shown to equal 12 .",
    "there is a general setup for studying central extensions of a finitely presented group in which all relations are given arbitrary central lifts in the extension . in the case of the group @xmath0",
    "this provides a series of group presentations depending on four integer parameters @xmath18 .",
    "the dilogarithmic extension @xmath5 appears in this series as @xmath19 .    although our main motivation was the result of theorem [ dilog ] we thought it is interesting to obtain the complete picture concerning the central extensions of @xmath0 in terms of explicit group presentations .",
    "this amounts to understand the cohomology 2-classes of @xmath0 by means of their associated extensions .",
    "[ exte0 ] let @xmath18 be the group presented by the generators @xmath20 and the relations : @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24=z^r\\ ] ] @xmath25=1\\ ] ] @xmath26=[{{\\overline{\\beta}}},z]=1\\ ] ] then each central extension of @xmath0 by @xmath27 is of the form @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , the class @xmath28 of the extension @xmath18 is given by : @xmath29    the extension classes behave linearly on the parameters and , in order to find their coefficients , one has to make use of several explicit ( central ) extensions .",
    "there are only a few such extensions in the literature , namely those coming from mapping class groups of planar surfaces with infinitely many punctures . for general central extensions we face new complications due to the presence of the discrete godbillon - vey class .",
    "the ptolemy - thompson group @xmath15 is one such mapping class group , but it is useless in computing the coefficients of the godbillon - vey class .",
    "the other extension of the same kind is the greenberg - sergiescu acyclic extension ( see @xcite ) and hence the core of the proof of theorem [ exte0 ] consists of computations within the greenberg - sergiescu extension .",
    "this lead us to the formula for @xmath30 stated in theorem [ exte0 ] .    all over this paper",
    "the ptolemy - thompson group @xmath0 appears in every one of its instances , as a group of homeomorphisms of the circle , as the group of flips , as the group @xmath31 and as a mapping class group .",
    "a main difficulty is to pass from one description to another one .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we introduce in the first part the braided ptolemy - thompson @xmath15 and the induced abelianized central extension @xmath32 .",
    "we will explain that the class @xmath33 is a multiple of the euler class and provide a short proof that it should be 12 times the later .",
    "in particular we describe all central extensions associated to multiples of the euler class . in the second part",
    "we give a quick overview of the quantization of the teichmller space , following mostly fock and goncharov s series of papers , to introduce the dilogarithmic projective representation of the ptolemy - thompson group . as projective representations",
    "are in one - to - one correspondence with central extensions one obtains what we will call the dilogarithmic extension @xmath5 of @xmath0 . in the final section of this part",
    "we prove that @xmath5 and @xmath32 are isomorphic .",
    "the third part of the paper is devoted to the classification of all central extensions of @xmath0 by @xmath27 .",
    "the major problem is to understand the behavior of the discrete godbillon - vey class in extensions .",
    "if the braided ptolemy - thompson group @xmath15 was the geometric model in the first part now we make use of the greenberg - sergiescu @xmath34 of @xmath0 .",
    "the method for computing the classes of extensions is inspired by milnor s algorithm concerning the euler class of a surface group representation .",
    "the last section contains some speculations on what should be the geometric extensions of @xmath0 on one hand , and the central extensions of the mapping class group of a finite ( punctured ) surface arising in the quantized teichmller theory .",
    "although we use some of the results from @xcite and @xcite , quite a large amount of these papers is not essential for understanding the present paper .",
    "we also outlined the main constructions from @xcite in the case of the universal teichmller space in order to make the paper more self - contained .",

    "thus the restriction of @xmath37 to any interval @xmath40 is given by @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 belong to the set of dyadic numbers i.e. @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",

    "each finite rooted binary tree encodes a subdivision of @xmath36 $ ] into dyadic intervals . adding two descending edges to a vertex amounts to subdivide the respective interval into two equal halves .",

    "the elements @xmath604 are respectively of order 3 , 4 and 5 .",
    "since the euler class of @xmath34 is zero , it splits over cyclic subgroups of @xmath0 and the same holds then for @xmath511 .",
    "this implies that @xmath605 , @xmath606 , @xmath607 .",
    "moreover , the permutation induced by @xmath592 is a cycle of length 9 and thus is even .",
    "in particular @xmath608 and so @xmath609 .      in order to finish the proof we need to compute @xmath155 .",
    "we have first :    [ first ] we have @xmath610 , for some @xmath611 .",
    "it suffices to use proposition [ linearform ] and the linearity of the function @xmath612 .",
    "for the later , use the arguments from the proof of lemma [ linearm ] where the case @xmath462 is treated .",
    "we skip the details",
    ".    propositions [ class ] and [ coeff ] show that @xmath613 , and hence @xmath614 .",
    "then proposition [ alpha ] finishes the proof of theorem [ exte0 ] .",
    "the analysis above can be used in establishing also the following :    the group @xmath505 is finitely generated .    consider the group @xmath34 , the general case following the same way .",
    "the elements @xmath521 and @xmath522 generate the quotient @xmath0 and it suffices to add sufficiently many elements to be able to generate all of @xmath16 , which is the braid group on the punctures .",
    "let @xmath573 be the braiding of the first two punctures of the pending line at @xmath48 .",
    "let denote by @xmath579 the mapping class of the homeomorphism which translates one unit along the line made by gluing together the two ( half)-lines pending at @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "observe now that @xmath579 conjugate @xmath573 to any of the braid generators of the pending line at @xmath48 and @xmath49 . on the other hand",
    "the action of @xmath0 by conjugation on @xmath34 is transitive on the set of pending lines , as it is the action of @xmath173 on the binary tree .",
    "this means that for vertex of the rooted binary tree there exists a word @xmath615 such that the corresponding element of @xmath34 sends the pending line at @xmath490 asymptotically onto the pending line at @xmath48 .",
    "the meaning of the word asymptotically is that all but finitely many vertices of the respective line are sent into the other ones . the first few vertices might be sent onto other pending lines , as it happens with @xmath521 and @xmath522 which slide finitely many points .",
    "however sliding of punctures occur only at the supports of @xmath521 and @xmath522 .",
    "thus the line pending at @xmath490 is sent into the line pending at @xmath48 and slidings of its vertices could appear only when its first vertex will reach the set @xmath616 .",
    "let then @xmath219 be the mapping class group of an admissible subsurface containing the supports of @xmath521 and @xmath522 .",
    "it follows that adjoining the generators of @xmath219 to @xmath617 we generate all of @xmath16 and thus @xmath34 .",
    "we would like to understand all extensions @xmath618 coming out from _ nature_. a tentative approach is to say that such an extension is geometric if there exists a tessellation of a planar surface @xmath69 with infinitely many punctures such that @xmath372 is the asymptotic mapping class group of @xmath69 with this extra structure ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "then @xmath16 is the braid group in the punctures .    in order to avoid trivial constructions we restrict to those examples which are _ minimal _ in some sense .",
    "the simplest minimality condition is to ask the natural homomorphism @xmath619 to have one orbit of generators of @xmath16 i.e. that @xmath0 acts transitively on the first homology of the surface @xmath69 .",
    "alternatively , this amounts to require that the lifts of the generators @xmath58 and @xmath59 of @xmath0 together with a standard braid generator @xmath573 form a generator system for @xmath372 .",
    "it is known that the mapping class group @xmath620 of a punctured surface @xmath69 embeds into the groupoid of flips acting on the triangulations of @xmath69 with vertices at punctures .",
    "quantization of the teichmller space of the surface @xmath69 lead then by the technology of @xcite to projective representations of the mapping class group @xmath620 and thus to a central extension @xmath621 .",
