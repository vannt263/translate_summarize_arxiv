    "in the real world , there are many spatial search problems that involve multiple agents or searchers .",
    "communication between such agents or between agents and a centralized command center may be sensitive , costly , or difficult for various reasons . in this work ,",
    "we explore spatial search problems in this context and examine the classes of search problems for which communication and coordination between multiple agents will enable quantitative advantages over independent information gathering .",
    "these problems are very general and can be formalized and solved in terms of information theory .",
    "the solutions are essential to the development of quantitative decision support tools under uncertainty ( e.g. in medicine  @xcite ) and for automated multi - agent searches for stochastic information  @xcite , such as those involving distributed sensor networks  @xcite .",
    "a search may be thought of as a series of steps by which an agent or agents reduce the uncertainty of the location of a target to zero .",
    "this location may be in physical space or in a `` space of possibilities , '' i.e. , a set of alternative scenarios .",
    "for example , if you need to find your keys in the morning before going to work and there are five rooms in your house , initially you know your keys must be in one of these rooms .",
    "after thoroughly searching one room and not finding the keys , your uncertainty is reduced ; the keys must now be in one of the four remaining rooms , and so on . if you find the keys in the second room , then the uncertainty of their location is immediately zero because you know with complete certainty that they are in your hand .",
    "now imagine you have a friend help you search .",
    "the two of you would be searching twice as fast since , assuming you and your friend share information , a pair of searchers can eliminate rooms at a rate twice as fast as that of a single searcher . in more complex search problems ,",
    "the target might emit some kind of complicated signal that makes it possible for multiple coordinated searchers to dramatically increase efficiency ( imagine there are one thousand rooms to search but the keys are attached to some kind of radioactive homing beacon or can emit a sound ) . in these situations , understanding the nature of the clues and sharing information can be extraordinarily beneficial .",
    "a search whereby agents move based _ expressly _ on information cues rather than following gradients is known as an infotaxis search . in a 2007 paper , vergassola et al .",
    "explored infotaxis in the context of a moth following a pheromone trail through air to find a mate .",
    "the moth was performing a spatial search in turbulent air currents that carried the trail h  @xcite . compared to more conventional methods such as chemotaxis ( following a chemical gradient  @xcite )",
    ", infotaxis gives an advantage in situations when the signals from the target of the search are uncertain .",
    "this might be the case if signals from the target are stochastic , difficult to measure , or highly varying in time . in the case of the moth ,",
    "the signal was sparse and widely dispersed by the turbulent air currents .",
    "when the moth followed the gradient of the strength of the trail directly  chemotaxis  it was forced to take a very circuitous route due to the turbulent dispersal of the trail . however , when the moth employed an infotaxis algorithm to move to positions where it might gain the most information about the source of the trail , its performance improved significantly .",
    "since we will consider only search problems such as these , in the following we will refer to the target of an infotaxis search as the `` source . ''",
    "the formalism of infotaxis balances the competing goals of exploiting the current information available and exploring to gain more information , a familiar compromise from other unsupervised learning methods , such as reinforcement learning  @xcite . while effective path planning algorithms may be based on the optimization of some objective function , these often rely on exploiting some features of the known environment  @xcite rather than a solid foundation based on information theory .",
    "infotaxis provides a framework for studying search problems in general and is therefore broadly applicable .    in this article",
    ", we explore conditions in which cooperation between multiple infotaxis agents is advantageous .",
    "we focus on examples in which agents are able to realize synergetic cooperation by aggregating information and moving based on a local infotaxis algorithm .",
    "_ synergy _ , and its opposite , _ redundancy _ , are information theoretic quantities that are defined in terms of relative probabilities of the stochastic variables involved  @xcite . in a recent paper",
    ", we showed that spatiotemporal correlations are necessary for synergy  @xcite .",
    "when synergy is exploited effectively it can lead to an exponential reduction in the search effort , in terms of time , energy , or number of steps  @xcite .",
    "here we use a simple one - dimensional search example and a more realistic two - dimensional generalization to show how correlations lead to synergy .",
    "these simple examples provide a framework for analyzing more complex problems .",
    "since , in general , the computational cost is greater for searchers to communicate and perform coordinated movements instead of moving based on independent decisions , we will describe situations in which coordination is worthwhile .",
    "effective and robust search methods for locating stochastic sources balance the competing strategies of exploration and exploitation  @xcite . given a current estimated probability distribution for the location of a source a searcher might either exploit the data already collected by moving towards the location that maximizes this likelihood or sharpen the distribution ( reduce uncertainty further ) by moving to gather more diverse data .",
    "the infotaxis search balances these two strategies by optimizing the expected information gain over the possible next search moves . in the following we review some basic concepts from information theory and formalize the infotaxis algorithm in terms of these quantities .      to determine whether searchers can be effectively coordinated we define define synergy and redundancy as information theoretical quantities  @xcite and use them as a measure of coordination .",
    "synergy is found when measuring two or more variables _ together _ with respect to another ( e.g. the source s signal ) results in a greater information gain than the sum of that from each variable _ separately _  @xcite . in search problems , synergy is advantageous because then the coordination of two or more searchers is more efficient than the same searchers working independently . in this section",
    "we will introduce these concepts in general terms before applying them to a specific search problem .",
    "consider the stochastic variables @xmath0 .",
    "each variable @xmath1 , representing a searcher or source location , can take on specific states , denoted by the corresponding lowercase letter @xmath2 . for a single variable @xmath1",
    "the shannon entropy ( henceforth `` entropy '' ) is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the probability that the variable @xmath1 takes on the value",
    "@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the sum is over all of the possible states @xmath5 ; since @xmath6 always , the entropy is always positive .",
    "the entropy is a measure of uncertainty about the state of @xmath1 , therefore entropy can only decrease or remain unchanged as more variables are measured .",
    "the conditional entropy of a variable @xmath7 given a second variable @xmath8 is @xmath9 this expression contains a sum over the joint probability distribution of two variables . since measuring a second variable can only decrease entropy ( or leave it unchanged ) , the conditional entropy is bounded above by the entropy of the first variable . the mutual information between two variables , which plays an important role in search strategy , is defined as the change in entropy when a variable is measured : @xmath10    this is also the difference between the entropy of one variable and its entropy conditioned on the measurement of a second variable .",
    "mutual information is always positive .",
    "these definitions can be directly extended to multiple variables . just as entropy may be conditioned on an additional measurement , mutual information may be conditioned on the knowledge of other variables .",
    "these quantities may be used to generate new information theoretic constructs that we will use in specific search problems . for three variables  @xcite the quantity",
    "@xmath11 measures the degree of `` overlap '' in the information contained in variables @xmath12 and @xmath13 with respect to @xmath14 .",
    "the sign of this quantity is meaningful .",
    "if @xmath15 , there is overlap and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are said to be redundant with respect to @xmath14 . if @xmath16 , more information is available when these variables are considered together than when considered separately . in this case @xmath12 and @xmath13 are said to be synergetic with respect to @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath17 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are independent .      we first formulate the general spatial stochastic search problem for @xmath18 searchers seeking to find a stochastic source located in a finite , @xmath19-dimensional space .",
    "this is a generalization of the single searcher formalism presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . at any time step ,",
    "the searchers @xmath20 , @xmath21 , are located at position @xmath22 and observe some number of particles @xmath23 from the source .",
    "the searchers do not get information about the trajectories or speed of the particles ; they only get information if a particle was observed or not . therefore simple geometrical methods such as triangulation are not possible .",
    "consider a random variable @xmath24 , which can assume a number of specific values , denoted by @xmath25 .",
    "the values of @xmath25 refer to positions in space that may contain the stochastic source .",
    "only one value of @xmath26 corresponds to the ( yet unknown ) location of the source @xmath27 . the searchers compute and share a probability distribution @xmath28 for the source location at each time index @xmath29 .",
    "initially the probability for the source @xmath30 is assumed to be to be uniform .",
    "after each measurement @xmath31 , the searchers update their estimated probability distribution of source positions via bayesian inference  @xcite and decide what move to make ( possibly remaining at the same position ) .",
    "the goal of bayesian inference is to improve an estimated probability distribution @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is a random variable that can assume a set of values denoted by @xmath34 . assuming that @xmath35 is another random variable ( that can assume a set of values denoted by @xmath36 ) and that @xmath33 and @xmath35 are not independent ( that is , @xmath37 ) , knowledge of the state of @xmath35 can be used to improve @xmath32 . after a measurement reveals @xmath38 , the probability of this measurement given the current estimated is computed .",
    "the probability of this measurement is @xmath39 .",
    "bayesian inference makes it possible to assimilate this information into the current estimate of @xmath32 via a bayesian update step : @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is a normalization factor .",
    "this step includes an explicit statement of equivalence because each new measurement is included implicitly in @xmath32 .",
    "therefore the measurement @xmath38 improves the estimate of @xmath32 .",
    "the searchers will use this bayesian inference framework to improve their estimate of the probability distribution of source locations @xmath42 after each measurement @xmath43 .    to decide where to move next",
    ", the searchers follow an infotaxis algorithm for multiple searchers .",
    "first the conditional probability @xmath44 is calculated , where @xmath41 is a normalization over all possible source locations @xmath25 as required by bayesian inference .",
    "this is then assimilated via bayesian update , @xmath45 if the searchers do not find the source at their present locations they choose the next local move using an infotaxis step to maximize the expected information gain .",
    "the expected information gain is computed in the following way .",
    "the entropy of the distribution @xmath28 at time @xmath29 is defined as @xmath46 for a specific measurement @xmath31 the entropy _ before _ the bayesian update is @xmath47 we define the difference between the entropy at time @xmath29 and the entropy at time @xmath48 after a measurement @xmath31 to be @xmath49 for a uniform prior , @xmath50 for @xmath51 possible locations of the source in the discrete space , the entropy is maximum , @xmath52 . for each possible joint move @xmath53 ,",
    "the change in expected entropy @xmath54 is computed and the move with the minimum ( most negative ) @xmath54 is executed .",

    ".   corresponds to one of the searchers finding the source in the next time step ( the final entropy will be @xmath56 so @xmath57 ) .",
    "the second term considers the reduction in entropy for all possible measurements at the proposed location , weighted by the probability of each of those measurements .",
    "the probability of the searchers obtaining the measurement @xmath58 at the location @xmath53 is given by the trace of the probability @xmath59 over all possible source locations .",
    "at each step the searchers move jointly to increase the expected information gain as measured by the change in entropy of the probability distribution .",
    "although this algorithm is general in the following we consider only the case of two searchers ( @xmath60 and both one- and two - dimensional spatial domains .",
    "sources that emit uncorrelated signals provide no opportunity for coordination because the searchers are never synergetic  @xcite .",
    "we instead consider signals with spatial , temporal , or other correlations .",
    "the simplest nontrivial example is searching in a one - dimensional domain for a source that emits two particles simultaneously in opposite directions .",
    "two searchers should be able to exploit the correlations in the signal ; if both searchers simultaneously observe particles , they can immediately conclude that the source is located between them",
    ". therefore we expect synergy to be possible for some spatial arrangements of the source and searchers .",

    "the source is assumed emit two particles simultaneously and in opposite directions .",
    "that is , one particle is emitted to the left and one to the right of the source .",
    "the two searchers @xmath61 and @xmath62 are identical with a fixed cross section such that @xmath64 is the probability of a searcher capturing one of the particles emitted from the source . at each step in the search the number of particle `` hits '' measured by searchers @xmath61 and @xmath62 are denoted by @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .    to calculate @xmath67",
    "it is first necessary to compute the probabilities of @xmath68 for each searcher given the position of the source @xmath25 .",
    "we note that since there is no distance dependence in the capture probability @xmath69 , it is sufficient to consider three separate cases depending on the relative positions , or ordering , of the source and the searchers , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1d_diagram ] .",
    "for example , if @xmath61 is to the left of the source and @xmath62 is to the right of the source , the order is @xmath70 .",
    "note this is equivalent to the case @xmath71 since the searchers are identical .",
    "according to the relative spatial ordering for the source @xmath27 and searchers @xmath72 . since the searchers are identical , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are interchangeable and there are only three unique cases . ]",
    "if a searcher observes a particle , it is assumed to be absorbed so that the other searcher will not be able to observe it .",
    "for example if @xmath61 is between @xmath62 and the source ( case @xmath73 or @xmath74 ) then the probability that @xmath62 observes a particle depends on whether @xmath61 observed it .",
    "if @xmath61 observed it , then the probability that @xmath62 observes it must be 0 . if @xmath61 did not observe it then the probability that @xmath62 will observe it is @xmath69 @xmath75 we can use the probability relation @xmath76 to compute the two - searcher conditional probabilities @xmath77 the other probability distributions are computed using similar reasoning .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ tab:1d ] .",
    ".conditional probabilities for the six possible arrangements of the source @xmath27 and searchers @xmath78 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1d_diagram ] . since the searchers are identical , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are interchangeable and there are only three unique cases . in cases @xmath79 and @xmath80 , searcher one is between the source and searcher two .",
    "a particle emitted by the source in the direction of the searchers will reach searcher one first .",
    "if searcher one detects the particle , searcher two will not be able to detect it .",
    "searcher two will only have a chance of detecting the particle if the particle passes through searcher one undetected .",
    "similarly , in cases @xmath81 and @xmath82 , the source is between the searchers and the searchers do not interfere with each other .",
    "furthermore , since the source emits two particles simultaneously in opposite directions , in only these cases do both searchers have a chance of each detecting a particle . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     note that the different cases in the one - dimensional example were taken into account implicitly during integration as in eq .  .",
    "in the two - dimensional example they are taken into account when the effective probability distributions are computed as a superposition of the probabilities of the individual cases .",
    "this is because there is more than one case for each source location relative to the searchers .",
    "we illustrate the two - dimensional searcher problem with a setup of searcher and source locations that illustrate the synergetic and redundant positions .",
    "we use the gaussian prior for the initial guess @xmath83 where @xmath41 is the normalization and @xmath84 determines the overall shape of the distribution .",
    "the vector @xmath85 is the most probable position of the source .",
    "the quantity @xmath86 [ see eq .",
    "] determines whether the searchers are positioned synergetically relative to the source .",
    "when the searchers are performing an infotaxis search , realizing synergetic relative positions will in principle lead to the fastest reduction in uncertainty .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dr ] we plot @xmath87 as a function of the position of one searcher @xmath88 with the position of the second searcher @xmath89 held fixed .",
    "we find for this example that only synergy ( @xmath90 ) is possible .",
    "the light areas in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dr ] correspond to weak synergy and the dark areas to stronger synergy . as in the one - dimensional example",
    "synergy is strongest for large @xmath69 and when searcher @xmath61 is near the source and not behind searcher @xmath62 . a small cross section [ @xmath91 in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dr](a ) ] allows only for weak synergy , whereas a larger cross section [ @xmath92 in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dr](b ) ] gives much stronger synergy for certain relative positions .",
    "the strongest synergy comes from a large cross section paired with optimal positioning .",
    "the maximum synergy is realized when searcher @xmath61 is close to the peak of @xmath93 and especially when the peak of @xmath93 is between the searchers , note that unfavorable positions ( such as @xmath94 , behind searcher @xmath62 ) provide minimal synergy regardless of the value of @xmath69 .",
    "is shown as a function of the position @xmath88 of searcher @xmath61 for two different values of the capture probability @xmath69 : ( a ) @xmath91 ; ( b ) @xmath92 .",
    "the position of searcher @xmath62 is fixed @xmath95 .",
    "the most probable source location ( the peak of the gaussian distribution for the initial source location ) is at @xmath96 .",
    "darker blue corresponds to stronger synergy ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "synergy is strongest for large @xmath69 and when searcher @xmath61 is near the source and not behind searcher @xmath62 relative to the source . ]    for real - world problems , larger cross sections yield more information and therefore stronger synergy is possible .",
    "however for some applications the cross section of a sensor on a searcher may be limited by practical considerations such as weight or power consumption .",
    "this example shows that synergy is still possible for small @xmath69 .",
    "furthermore , this example emphasizes the importance of the probability estimate of source locations @xmath97 .",
    "the infotaxis algorithm is designed such that the searchers will explore , gathering new information , if their arrangement is not sufficiently synergetic to warrant exploitation .",
    "this allows the searchers to succeed even with no starting information , but they may not realize strong synergy until the estimate of @xmath97 is sufficiently refined .",
    "in this work we studied search algorithms for autonomous agents looking for the spatial location of a stochastic source . in spatial search problems , since the exploitation of synergy requires spatial or temporal correlations , we considered problems in which a source emits two particles simultaneously in opposite directions .",
    "this is a simplification of physical problems in which there is a reaction and the products travel in directions that have angular correlations .",
    "we showed that both synergy and redundancy are possible for one - dimensional search problems but not for two - dimensional searches , where only synergy is possible .",
    "since even unfavorable arrangements of searchers are synergetic , in two - dimensional search problems like these coordination is always advantageous .",
    "simple examples such as these that can be studied analytically provide insight into real - world problems . in real - world problems , there will necessarily be additional considerations",
    ". it may not always be possible to write a closed - form equation for the nature of the correlations in the signal from the source .",
    "it may be necessary to directly measure any correlations and use this to estimate capture probabilities .",
    "furthermore , various probabilities may not be stationary in time or the signals from the source may get progressively weaker .",
    "for example , signals from a radio transmitter may decrease in strength over time as its batteries are slowly exhausted .",
    "an additional consideration is that in the real - world , communication between agents may only be possible at certain times and may not be instantaneous as in our simple examples .",
    "these general considerations are crucial for the exploitation of multi - agent infotaxis in terms of the design of optimal collective algorithms in particular applications .",
    "the next steps for making this approach applicable to a broader class of problems , including those not limited to spatial searches@xcite , are to generalize the results to more than two searchers and to explore how synergy may be best leveraged to give increases in search speed and efficiency .",
