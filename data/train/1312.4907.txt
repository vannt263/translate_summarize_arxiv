    "acoustic glitches in a star are the regions where the sound speed undergoes an abrupt variation due to a localized sharp change in the stratification .",
    "the major acoustic glitches are the boundaries between radiative and convective regions and the layers of ionization of elements , especially hydrogen and helium .",
    "such a glitch introduces an oscillatory component , @xmath0 , in the eigenfrequencies of the star with respect to the frequencies themselves @xcite , proportional to @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the acoustic depth of the glitch measured from the surface , @xmath3 the adiabatic sound speed , @xmath4 the radial distance of the glitch , @xmath5 the seismic radius of the star ( see discussion below ) , @xmath6 the frequency of a mode with radial order @xmath7 and degree @xmath8 , and @xmath9 a phase factor .",
    "each glitch will contribute to such a signal in the frequencies with a `` periodicity '' of twice the acoustic depth of the corresponding glitch .",
    "this oscillatory signature has been extensively studied for the sun in order to determine the extent of overshoot below the solar convection zone @xcite and the seismic solar age @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed earlier that this may be used for distant stars also to find the position of the base of the convective envelope or the second helium ionization zone @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xcite have used the modulation of the frequency separations to determine the location of the second helium ionization zone in the red giant star , hr7349 , observed with the _ corot _ satellite .",
    "recently , @xcite have used the oscillatory signal in the second differences of the frequencies of the solar - type _ corot _ target star hd49933 to determine the acoustic depths of its second helium ionization zone and the base of the convective envelope ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "earlier , @xcite reported detection of an acoustic glitch in procyon , although no association to a specific layer was made .",
    "the scientific interest in studying the acoustic glitches goes beyond the obvious goal of placing constraints on the positions of specific layers in the stellar interior .",
    "the accurate determination of the location and profile of the transition at the base of the convective envelope , for example , will help us refine our understanding of the stellar dynamo in cool stars . on the other hand ,",
    "the amplitude of the oscillatory signal from the ionization zones is directly related to the abundance of the corresponding element in the star . for helium",
    "especially , an estimate of the helium abundance in an ensemble of stars of different masses and ages will lead us to a better understanding of the process of element enrichment in stars which can be extrapolated back to the primordial helium content of the universe , an important parameter in cosmology .",
    "the acoustic glitches can be used to determine the acoustic depth of the surface convection zone in a star , which in turn can be used to constrain the stellar models . in particular",
    ", the position of the base of the convection zone is very sensitive to opacity of stellar material , which depends on the heavy element abundances .",
    "it is well known that the recent determination of heavy element abundances @xcite using 3d hydrodynamic atmospheric models for the sun are not consistent with helioseismic data ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "on the other hand , the older abundances of @xcite estimated using 1d atmospheric models are consistent with helioseismic data .",
    "the cause of this discrepancy is not understood and it would be interesting to test if asteroseismic data are consistent with the revised abundances . in particular , the heavy element abundance , @xmath10 , for stars is estimated from observed @xmath11}$ ]   ratio .",
    "thus the estimated value of @xmath10 depends on the heavy element mixture ( ratio of fe to h abundance ) for the sun .",
    "recently @xcite , noting the dependence on @xmath10 of the acoustic depth of the convection zone , proposed that the measured acoustic depth can be used to constrain @xmath10 .",
    "the effects of the acoustic glitches are subtle , and hence great care is required in ascertaining that the results of the analyses reflect the stellar properties at a significant level .",
    "although analysis of artificial data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are useful in this regard , real data may well give rise to effects that are not contained in such simulations .",
    "here we test the reliability of the inferences by comparing the results of several independent fits to the glitch properties of the same frequency data , using rather different techniques .",
    "these all provide measures of the acoustic locations of the glitches which can be directly compared .",
    "other properties of the fits , however , depend more sensitively on the techniques and hence can only properly be interpreted in the context of comparisons with model results .",
    "we return to this point in sect .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .    in the present analysis we studied 19 stars continuously observed by the _ kepler mission _",
    "@xcite during 9 months . launched on 2009 march 7 , _ kepler",
    "_  is monitoring 150000 stars in the constellations of cygnus and lyra every half an hour to look for earth - like planets orbiting around solar - like stars .",
    "photometric time series of a subsample of 512 stars are studied at a shorter cadence of 58.8s @xcite .",
    "every 3 months the spacecraft rolls by @xmath12 , to maintain the solar panels directed towards the sun .",
    "therefore , the datasets are organized in quarters .",
    "the time series of our sample of 19 stars were acquired during quarters 5 to 9 , processed following the methods described by @xcite , and their frequencies extracted as described by @xcite .",
    "it must be noted that for the purpose of detection of the acoustic glitches , it is sufficient to tag the frequencies only by their angular degree , @xmath8 .",
    "a visual inspection of the power spectrum yields a clear identification of @xmath8 of the different modes .",
    "we do not need to know the absolute overtone number , @xmath7 , of the modes .",
    "we only need to ensure that we do not have any `` missing '' orders ( since the large separation , i.e. , the average difference in frequency between successive overtones of the same angular degree @xmath8 , is known from the power spectrum itself , this is a trivial step ) .",
    "thus , when combining the frequencies to construct the required diagnostics , if the angular degree is known , the correct combination of frequencies can be made ( in some cases that just means taking differences of frequencies of modes of the same degree ) .",
    "the methods that we describe in the next section are , therefore , independent of any input from stellar models which are usually used to identify the radial order of observed modes .",
    "the choice of the sample of stars is only guided by the fact that these were among the stars with the best signal to noise ratio in the _ kepler_data .",
    "all the stars are classified as being either in the main sequence or early sub - giant phase and thus have very few mixed modes .",
    "mixed modes hinder the detection of the oscillatory signal of the acoustic glitches , and are best avoided for the present purpose .",
    "there would be other similar stars in the same region of the hr diagram , which are also expected to exhibit similar signals of acoustic glitches ; this is merely a random sample .    in the next section",
    "we describe in detail the different techniques used to determine the locations of the acoustic glitches . in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] we present the acoustic locations resulting from our fits to the observed frequencies , while sect .  [",
    "sec : results_models ] compares them with analyses of associated stellar models . sect .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] provides a discussion of results for individual stars .",
    "we summarize the conclusions in sect .  [",
    "sec : summary ] .",
    "appendix  [ app : methods ] presents details on the individual techniques , whereas appendix  [ app : model_details_yrec ] provides details of the stellar models used .",
    "we applied four different methods ( labelled a to d in appendix  [ app : methods ] ) to determine the acoustic locations of the base of the convective zone ( @xmath13 ) and the second helium ionization zone ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the different methods were applied to the same input data , namely the _ kepler _  frequencies of the stars , by different subsets of the present authors independently , and the final results are compared in sec .  [",
    "sec : results ] .",
    "the first method ( method a ) utilizes the oscillatory signals in the frequencies themselves .",
    "method b fits a functional form to the second differences of the frequencies with respect to the radial order with acoustic depths of @xmath13  and @xmath14among the free parameters .",
    "method c fits the second differences of the model frequency perturbations due to the glitches to the observed second differences .",
    "lastly , method d utilizes the oscillatory signal present in the ratio of the small to the large separation .",
    "the large separation is the average difference in frequencies of same degree and successive radial order , while the small separation is the difference in frequency between a radial mode and the quadrupole mode of the previous radial order .",
    "methods  a , b , and c determine the acoustic depths ( measured from the surface ) of the @xmath13  and @xmath14  while method  d determines the acoustic radius ( measured from the center ) of the @xmath13 .",
    "the details of each method are described in appendix  [ app : methods ] .",
    "we note that given that the methods employ different techniques on different combinations of frequencies the systematic effects would be quite different for each of them and it would be reasonable to expect considerable scatter in the results to be found from them .",
    "for the rest of the paper , we adopt the following definitions and notations for the acoustic radii and acoustic depth .",
    "@xmath15  and @xmath16  are the acoustic radii , defined as @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the radial positions of the two glitches .",
    "in particular , the radial position of the local minimum of the adiabatic index @xmath20 ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 are pressure and density respectively and @xmath23 is specific entropy ) in the region is taken to be @xmath19 .",
    "the acoustic depths of @xmath13  and @xmath14  are @xmath24  and @xmath25 , respectively , defined as @xmath26 @xmath27 here @xmath28  is the total acoustic radius of the star , which can be calculated as @xmath29 where @xmath5 is the seismic radius of the star , which may be considered as a fiducial radius that defines the outer phase of the acoustic modes , subject to the chosen boundary conditions , relative to the phase in the propagating region below the turning point .",
    "@xmath30 can be determined from fitting an approximated atmosphere , such as a polytropic atmosphere , to a more realistic stellar atmosphere ( such as that obtained from 3d numerical simulations or from observations ) . in the case of the sun",
    "this fiducial radius is above the temperature minimum , i.e. , rather far away from the photosphere ( about 225s above the radius corresponding to the effective temperature in the sun , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for the models used in this work ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : results_models ] ) , the outer boundary for the calculation of the total acoustic radius has been assumed to be the surface of the star including the atmosphere .",
    "the choice of the outer acoustic boundary may affect the value of the acoustic depth as determined by any of these methods .",
    "the total acoustic radius can also be estimated from the average large separation , @xmath31 , as @xmath32 .",
    "the validity of this approximation has been studied by @xcite .",
    "there are at least three different methods available in the literature for determining the observed value of @xmath31 : ( 1 ) from taking a mean or median value over some arbitrarily chosen frequency range for modes of like degree @xmath8 , ( 2 ) from determining the frequency of the corresponding spectral peak in the fourier spectrum of the power spectrum of the observed oscillations , ( 3 ) from fitting the asymptotic expression for solar - like oscillations @xcite to the observed frequencies .",
    "here we calculated @xmath31  by fitting a linear relation to the observed radial mode frequencies as a function of the radial order , which is equivalent to the third method above . in principle , an estimation of @xmath28  from @xmath31  measured by another alternative technique would yield a slightly different value .",
    "however , given that the large separation is a fairly robust quantity , especially for stars with high signal to noise ratio ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we do not expect this to be a major source of uncertainty .",

    "we compared not the acoustic depths directly , but the fractional acoustic radii of the @xmath13  and the @xmath14 .",

    "thus it should be theoretically a more robust quantity than the acoustic depth , which , being calculated from the surface inwards would include the sound speed profile in the outer layers .",
    "however , in converting the acoustic depth estimated from the oscillatory signal in frequencies to the corresponding acoustic radius we do use the approximate relationship between the total acoustic radius and the large separation . secondly , by considering the fractional acoustic radii instead of the acoustic radii itself , we remove the effect of overall homology scaling of the models at slightly different masses and radii .",
    "of course , the shift between the models in the relative position of the @xmath13and the @xmath14  inside the star reflects a true departure of the models from the observed star .      in this approach",

    "we deliberately spanned a very broad range in each of the global properties .",
    "this is because our aim here was to only determine the possible range in the locations of the acoustic glitches in stellar models similar to the target star , and compare the values estimated from the _ kepler _  data .",
    "further , we repeated the exact procedure of one of the methods ( b ) to obtain the acoustic depths @xmath24  and @xmath25  from the theoretical frequencies of the stellar models .",
    "this allowed us also to investigate possible systematic shifts between the theoretical acoustic locations of the glitches from the models and their estimated values from the oscillatory signal in the model frequencies themselves .",

    "* ) to model the stars",
    ". a detailed description of the models can be found in appendix  [ app : model_details_yrec ] .",

    "while comparing our estimates of the acoustic depths @xmath24  and @xmath25  from methods a , b and c to the acoustic radii from method d , or from typical models , we invoked the relationship between the total acoustic radius @xmath28  and the average large separation @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath32 .",
    "this relationship is an approximate one .",
    "further , the observed average large separation , @xmath31 , depends on the adopted frequency range over which it is measured and also on the adopted method .",
    "particular attention should be paid to the systematic biases involved in treating the outermost layers of the star by different seismic diagnostics dealing with the determination of acoustic depths of glitches .",
    "although one may hope that the different methods ( seismic diagnostics ) will provide similar stellar radii @xmath237 for the acoustic glitches of both the helium ionization zones and the base of the surface convection zone , the seismically measured acoustic depths @xmath238 of these glitches will in general be different , for they depend on the very details of the adopted seismic diagnostic .",
    "for example , method  c approximates the outer stellar layers by a polytrope with a polytropic index @xmath239 , allowing for some account of the location of the outer turning point of an incident acoustic wave by approximating the acoustic cutoff frequency @xmath240 @xcite .",
    "the location of the upper turning point affects the the phase of an incident mode and consequently also the location of the acoustic glitches , typically increasing their acoustic depths when the outer layers are approximated by a polytrope @xcite . a ( mathematically ) convenient way for estimating the phase at the upper turning point is to relate it to a fiducial location in the evanescent region far above the upper turning point , where the mode in the propagating region would `` feel '' the adiabatic sound speed @xmath3 to vanish , i.e. , where @xmath241 .",
    "this location , lying well inside the evanescent zone of most of the acoustic modes , defines the acoustic radius or acoustic surface .",
    "the squared adiabatic sound speed @xmath242 decreases in the adiabatically stratified region of an outer convection zone nearly linearly with radius ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". the location of the acoustic radius can therefore be estimated where the linearly outward extrapolated @xmath242 , with respect to radius @xmath237 , vanishes . in a solar model",
    "the so - determined location of the seismic surface is about 111s in acoustic height above the temperature minimum @xcite , or above 200s in acoustic height above the photosphere @xcite .",
    "this shift may explain in part the differences between the location of the acoustic glitches between the stellar models and our seismically determined values .",
    "there is also a noticeable systematic shift between the acoustic depth of the @xmath14  in a stellar model and its value estimated from the oscillatory signal in the model frequencies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : model_taucomp ] ) .",
    "the fitted value of @xmath25 , as obtained with methods a and b , is typically smaller than the model value by about 100s , on average .",
    "however , we do not find such a systematic shift between the @xmath24  values of the models and the fits .",
    "this is a general feature of most of the stars and might be because the depth of the heii ionization zone can not be uniquely defined since the ionization zone covers a finite range of radius . on the other hand ,",
    "the base of the convection zone is a clearly defined layer within the star . including also the glitch contribution from the first stage of helium ionization in the seismic diagnostic , additionally to the contribution from the second stage of helium ionization , perhaps leads to a more accurate definition of the acoustic depth of helium ionization , as considered in method c , resulting in larger values for the fitted acoustic depth @xmath25  as indicated in table  [ tab : res_comp ] .    in table",
    "[ tab : res_comp ] and figs .",
    "[ fig : model_taucomp ] and [ fig : amp_taucomp ] we did not take account of these differences in the acoustic depths between the methods  a , b and c and the calculated stellar models .",
    "it is also worth noticing that the @xmath28  values of amp models are systematically smaller ( by about 300s , or , by about @xmath243 , on average ) than those estimated from @xmath31  of the _ kepler _  data used in this paper ( see table  [ tab : results_amp ] ) .",
    "this may be due to a combination of factors , including imperfect modeling of the stars , especially of the surface layers .",
    "the amp fitting has been subjected to the surface correction technique @xcite , while this was not included in the analysis of the present data . however , even with stellar models , a difference of up to @xmath244 between the @xmath28  values derived from the asymptotic relation ( eq .",
