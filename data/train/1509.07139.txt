    "<S> let us briefly recall the concept of local and nonlocal correlations . </S>",
    "<S> assume that a source emits pairs of particles that travel to two distant stations , say alice and bob . </S>",
    "<S> as depicted in , the two experimentalists perform one out of several possible measurements on the individual particles they receive and record the associated outcomes . </S>",
    "<S> we denote alice s and bob s measurement choices by @xmath1 and @xmath2 and their recorded outcomes by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> they can then compute the correlation @xmath5 . given the setup </S>",
    "<S> , it seems natural to think that any correlations that alice and bob can observe in this way are due to particles having a common past , as they come from the same source . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to this common past by @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> correlations that can be explained by the existence of such a parameter are called _ local _ : @xmath7 bell s work shows that there are quantum correlations that can not be reproduced by such a local model , proving that quantum physics is inherently _ </S>",
    "<S> nonlocal_. nonlocality has since been demonstrated many times @xcite , and finds repercussion in a variety of applications  @xcite .     and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 , which we depict here as the setting of an active switch , and return outputs @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> there is the possibility for non - detection events , in which case the corresponding output variable takes the value @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> since these losses can be seen as happening inside the box , they can depend on the inputs @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the limited detection local case of this scenario , meaning that a local hidden variable @xmath6 not only fully describes the state of the particle , but can also influence whether or not a non - detection event occurs.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    however , when demonstrating quantum nonlocality , several issues have to be addressed . here , we are specifically interested in one of them : what happens if the particles can be lost on the way to or inside the measurement stations , including the possibility that they reach the detectors but are simply not registered . in this case , we say that @xmath9 or @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> one immediate idea is of course to carefully analyze why the particles get lost and , if the mechanisms are well understood , to simply discard these cases . </S>",
    "<S> this means that alice and bob postselect on the cases for which they both register a detection event : @xmath11 and @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> notably , this opens up the possibility that fully local correlations appear nonlocal if our understanding of the cause of the non - detection events is incorrect , a situation that we wish to avoid  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is especially relevant in the case of active adversaries in diqip applications . </S>",
    "<S> another option is to consider the non - detection events as an additional possible outcome and simply check if the resulting correlation is nonlocal . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , one will never mistake a local correlation for a nonlocal one . </S>",
    "<S> the drawback , however , is that even highly nonlocal distributions may now appear local .    in the end , </S>",
    "<S> the only way address this issue , usually called the detection loophole , consists of not only producing highly nonlocal correlations but also having a high enough detection efficiency  @xcite . if the latter is not satisfied , even a perfect state preparation and perfectly calibrated measurement apparatus do not help and one is left with an inconclusive experiment unless the detection loophole is assumed to be not exploited . </S>",
    "<S> it is only recently that all the potential loopholes in a bell test have been closed in a single experiment for the first time  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , closing the detection loophole in long - range experiments and applications remains difficult . </S>",
    "<S> namely , after a transmission through @xmath13 km of the currently best optical fiber , the losses already exceed the tolerable threshold . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore take a different route in this paper .    here , we introduce the concept of limited detection locality . </S>",
    "<S> it consists of an intermediate assumption between neglecting the detection loophole and closing it completely . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this assumption , even when arbitrarily weak , allows demonstrating nonlocality by postselection with arbitrarily low overall detection efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> we then connect the concepts of limited detection locality and measurement dependent locality  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss a dedicated twin - photon experiment that we performed , and show how quantum nonlocality can be revealed despite low detection efficiencies without having to make the fair - sampling assumption .    _ limited detection locality ( ldl) _ assume that there exist a fixed @xmath14 and @xmath15 with @xmath16\\subsetneqq [ 0,1]$ ] such that @xmath17 and similarly for bob . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to the assumption that , for any input @xmath1 and any common local variable @xmath6 , there is a probability of at least @xmath14 and at most @xmath15 of having a detection . </S>",
    "<S> consider for example a world in which the polarization degree of freedom of photons was as of yet undiscovered . </S>",
    "<S> it is nowadays well known that the detection efficiency of most photonic detectors is indeed sensitive to the polarization degree of freedom of light . </S>",
    "<S> however the detection efficiency never goes up to @xmath18 or down to @xmath19 , which corresponds to our assumption of limited detection efficiency with nontrivial @xmath14 and @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> it is also worth noting that the assumption can be imposed at the cost of weakening the established correlations by a partial postselection . </S>",
    "<S> we do not discuss this further here , but refer to @xcite for an explanation of this idea . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to correlations fulfilling conditions ( [ locality ] ) and ( [ lde ] ) as _ limited detection local_. note that technically , the case of @xmath16=[0,1]$ ] can still be analyzed with our model , making it possible to retrieve the results discussed in  @xcite .    in an experiment </S>",
    "<S> , one can additionally determine the actual observed detection efficiencies , which may of course be different for the different sets of inputs . </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary that some detections occurred for all possible sets of inputs , which reads @xmath20 since @xmath21 we have that @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> all of this holds analogously for bob s side . to ease notation </S>",
    "<S> , we define @xmath23 .    </S>",
    "<S> we can now focus on the postselected limited detection local distributions given by @xmath24    similarly to local correlations , these postselected limited detection local correlations fulfill certain conditions . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , they form a convex polytope and therefore respect a set of linear bell - like inequalities  @xcite . making the additional assumption that @xmath25 for all @xmath26 , one of these inequalities is , for example , given by @xmath27 in an experiment with given losses </S>",
    "<S> , the experimentalists can check for which values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 their observed correlations violate this inequality . </S>",
    "<S> they can then conclude that no limited detection local model with these parameters could have reproduced them .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , there are quantum correlations that do not fulfill this inequality independently of the observed detection efficiencies @xmath28 and for any upper bound @xmath15 as long as @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , this is achieved by all quantum correlations violating hardy s paradox  @xcite and can therefore be realised using any sufficiently pure partially entangled 2-qubit state with the right set of projective measurements </S>",
    "<S> . this may be quite surprising since it is well - known that without the assumption of limited detection efficiency ( [ lde ] ) , a minimal observed detection efficiency of @xmath30 is required to demonstrate nonlocality for 2 parties using binary inputs and outputs . </S>",
    "<S> however , making the arbitrarily weak additional assumption that @xmath31 allows demonstrating quantum nonlocality despite arbitrarily large losses and detection inefficiencies .    </S>",
    "<S> _ link to measurement dependent locality ( mdl) _ another way to counterfeit nonlocal correlations using only local resources is if the common history @xmath6 is correlated with the inputs @xmath1 and @xmath2 . if the correlation can be arbitrary , then any nonlocal correlation can be counter - fitted in this way , so limitations have to be imposed to be able to make any conclusions . together with some co - authors </S>",
    "<S> , we recently studied the case of measurement dependent local correlations  @xcite that are defined in the following way : @xmath32 note that if alice and bob each have @xmath33 inputs , then @xmath34 due to the normalization of probability distributions . </S>",
    "<S> similarly to this paper , we showed that the set of mdl - correlations for fixed @xmath35 and @xmath36 can be analysed using bell - like inequalities .    </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that there exists a strong link between the concepts of limited detection locality and measurement dependent locality . </S>",
    "<S> we make this connection explicit by the following theorem , whose demonstration is detailed in the supplemental material  @xcite :    * theorem : * assume that we have a correlation that can be produced by using a combination of postselected limited detection ( [ lde ] ) and measurement dependent ( [ mdlcond ] ) local ( [ mdlcorr ] ) resources , with parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> then , this correlation can also be reproduced using only measurement dependent local resources with @xmath39 and @xmath40 .    </S>",
    "<S> intuitively , the link comes from the fact that an adversary that is allowed , via postselection , to discard unsatisfying inputs is in fact influencing the choice of inputs . </S>",
    "<S> a consequence of this theorem is that whenever a correlation can not be reproduced by a measurement dependent local model with bounds @xmath41 and @xmath42 , then it can also not be realized using limited detection efficiencies with @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where @xmath33 is the number of inputs for each of the two parties . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to use any result derived for the mdl - scenario and apply them to ldl - correlations . </S>",
    "<S> even more interestingly , we are now able to deal with the problems of losses and measurement dependence in a straightforward way since we can simply focus exclusively on measurement dependence .     or @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the boxes are given inputs @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which decide which pairs of detectors are switched on , and return outputs @xmath3 and @xmath4 depending on which detector fires . </S>",
    "<S> if the photon goes towards the inactive pair of detectors it is simply considered as lost and not registered . </S>",
    "<S> we compare this scenario to the scenario where a local hidden variable @xmath6 that can influence the losses and settings try to emulate our observed correlations.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    _ experiment : _ we now discuss the twin - photon based experimental realization whose principle is depicted in . </S>",
    "<S> each user s station comprises 2 measurement devices with fixed settings , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , 4 single - photon detectors ( 8 in total ) . the detection events at alice s are space - like separated from the corresponding ones at bob s . in order to emulate active switches between different analyzis settings at each user s location without being limited by driving speeds </S>",
    "<S> , we exploit instead a simple and elegant solution for passive implementation , referred to as zbinden switches  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first , standard 50/50 beam - splitters connect the incoming photons to the measurement devices . </S>",
    "<S> then , two quantum random number generators ( qrng ) provide the inputs @xmath1 for alice and @xmath2 for bob to randomly select one pair of detectors associated with one measurement . the other two detectors of each box remain inactive . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , when , in any run of the experiment , a photon hits an inactive detector , it is merely disregarded . </S>",
    "<S> hence , with perfect devices , the maximum attainable detection efficiency is @xmath45 .    </S>",
    "<S> our source produces partially entangled photon pairs close to the state @xmath46 and the 8 detectors are set up to perform measurements close to the ideal projective measurements @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , with @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> further experimental details are given in  @xcite as well as in the supplemental material  @xcite . without any additional noise </S>",
    "<S> , the resulting correlations would violate inequality ( [ ldlineq ] ) , @xmath52 and @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , due to noise and imperfections even in the postselected case this is not fully realized . </S>",
    "<S> our postselected correlations , meaning that we discard all the non - detection events , can be found in table  [ probexp ] . while we did not precisely determine the overall detection efficiency in our experiment , it is worth to note that it stands clearly below the required @xmath54 efficiency that is necessary to close the detection loophole in the case of 2 parties with binary inputs and outputs  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , assuming that the losses are the same for all input pairs , _ </S>",

    "<S> , we have that @xmath57 and one gets @xmath58 , _ i.e. _ , such an adversary would have to lower the detector efficiencies corresponding to settings they do not like down to below @xmath59 in order to have local correlations appear nonlocal . in our experiment , due to the beam - splitters , the losses in the fibres and the difficulties of perfectly aligning 8 detectors , we can safely consider that @xmath60 , leading to a required @xmath61 in order to reproduce the correlations using a local hidden variable model .    </S>",

    "<S> [ cols=\"^,^,^ , < , </S>",
    "<S> < , < , < \" , ]     additionally , the way our experiment was built and carried out clearly shows the link between limited detection efficiency and measurement dependence . at both alice s and </S>",

    "<S> the link to measurement dependence is here obvious .    </S>",
    "<S> we can use theorem 1 to extend our analysis to the case where we consider our random number generators providing the inputs @xmath1 and @xmath2 to be biased . </S>",
    "<S> let us assume that there is some measurement dependence as defined in ( [ mdlcond ] ) , given by parameters @xmath38 , as well as some limited detection efficiency , given by parameters @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> using an mdl inequality provided in @xcite and theorem 1 , we then conclude that our experiment shows quantum nonlocality for @xmath63    _ conclusion  _ losses and detection inefficiencies have been serious obstacles in all experiments dedicated to test bell s theorem . </S>",
    "<S> this is why a loop - hole free bell - test took so long to be successfully demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> they are also part of the main weak points that an adversary may attack in any task whose security relies on quantum nonlocality . </S>",
    "<S> to help dealing with both of these issues from a theoretical point of view , we have introduced the additional assumption of limited detection efficiency ( [ lde ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the assumption is that the inefficiencies in the setup are only partially exploited , an idea that we consider very intuitive in itself especially in the case of a fundamental bell test , provided nature is non - malicious . </S>",
    "<S> the case of an adversary is also interesting . </S>",
    "<S> if one assumes an adversary with full control over alice s and/or bob s devices , then one needs to resort to full device - independent quantum information processing ( diqip )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , semi - diqip is extremely appealing and timely as it allows one to lower the extremely high requirement of full diqip . </S>",
    "<S> for example , considering diqip as a way to check the proper functioning of our system , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , going back to the original idea of self - testing  @xcite , it is very natural to assume that possible defects do not set @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> in such a case , our approach provides much simpler self - tests . </S>",
    "<S> even against an active adversary , there are cases in which it is reasonable to assume that they have only partial control on the detection efficiencies .    </S>",
    "<S> making the fair - sampling assumption when it is not warranted can lead to disastrously wrong conclusions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the same holds for the ldl assumption in cases where it is not justified . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to the fact the ldl assumption is strictly weaker than assuming fair - sampling , it can clearly hold and be justified more often . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , if an adversary is not able to fully suppress the detection events , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , @xmath29 , nonlocality can be demonstrated and exploited .    </S>",
    "<S> we connected the ideas of limited detection locality and measurement dependent locality . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that results from studying measurement dependent local correlations can be applied to the case of limited detection locality . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is possible to deal with detection efficiencies and lack of measurement independence at the same time , which we hope will be of use for future bell experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we carried out an experiment to bring these theoretical ideas to the real world . </S>",
    "<S> our twin - photon based demonstration , having detection efficiencies too low to close the detection loophole  @xcite , remains conclusive as long as we assume a limited detection efficiency such that @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> it furthermore reveals very clearly the link between measurement dependence and limited detection . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the methods depicted here will be of use to any frontier experiments or applications that do not manage to close the detection loophole completely .    </S>",
    "<S> _ note added  _ during the review process , we became aware , in addition to ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , of two more experimental demonstrations related to loophole - free bell tests  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ acknowledgments  _ we acknowledge alex may who wrote down an early version of a proof similar to the one given in appendix 2 showing a connection between limited detection and measurement dependence , as well as roger colbeck , who mentioned the idea of limited detection in private discussions . </S>",
