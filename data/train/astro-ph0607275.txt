    "one of the legacy products of the cobe satellite @xcite was a determination of the normalization of the matter power spectrum , which to this day is often referred to as the cobe normalization .",
    "surprisingly , only limited effort has been made so far to extract the equivalent result from wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) observations @xcite , with the papers to date quoting only the normalization marginalized over all cosmological parameters . for inflationary cosmologies",
    "this is not quite the quantity required ; inflation models predict the spectral index and tensor - to - scalar ratio , and hence should be normalized assuming these parameters are fixed . because the normalization does depend significantly on those parameters even across just the region allowed by the data , marginalization over those parameters significantly worsens the apparent uncertainty , as well as losing the information on how the normalization correlates to these parameters .",
    "the cobe normalization of inflationary cosmologies was given , from the four - year data , by bunn , liddle and white @xcite .",
    "they used a data - analysis methodology described by bunn and white @xcite .",
    "their treatment considered both the then - popular critical - density cosmology , and also the flat dark - energy dominated cosmologies favoured today .",
    "the results were somewhat confusing , as they used a definition of the normalization that depended on the value of @xmath4 ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and also quoted the present - day normalization from which a growth factor correction would have to be subtracted to generate the primordial amplitude predicted by inflation .",
    "nevertheless , the result had a statistical uncertainty of only 7 percent , and has been frequently used to constrain inflationary models . in single - field models",
    "it simply fixes the overall normalization of the potential ; in a one - parameter case such as @xmath5 this completely fixes the model . in hybrid inflation models",
    "the constraint may be less trivial , as the instability point ending inflation may not scale directly with the overall normalization . in models such as the curvaton model @xcite , where adiabatic perturbations are generated after inflation from isocurvature ones , the normalization constrains a combination of model parameters including the initial value of the curvaton field .",
    "no inflation theory purports to predict the perturbation amplitude at anything like the 7 percent level already achieved by cobe .",
    "nevertheless , we argue that the wmap normalization is an important legacy result of the wmap survey .",
    "further , it is bizarre that the currently quoted normalization uncertainties from wmap hardly improve on the quoted cobe level at all , due to the marginalization over inflationary parameters .",
    "it is also an opportunity to quote the result in more modern model - independent terminology .",
    "the normalization calculation is straightforward .",
    "the inflationary parameters are @xmath0 and @xmath1 , giving the density perturbation spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio in standard conventions ; a typical inflation model would predict values for those and hence should be normalized assuming those fixed values .",
    "we carried out a series of runs of the cosmomc code @xcite in which @xmath0 and @xmath1 are fixed at different values across a grid , making 28 evaluations combining @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this comfortably covers the values of these parameters favoured by current observations from wmap combined with other data . in our analysis",
    "we consider wmap data alone , including both temperature and polarization data . a power - law primordial spectrum is assumed throughout and the tensor spectral index fixed by the single - field inflationary consistency equation ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "the parameters allowed to vary and subsequently marginalized over are the matter density @xmath8 , the baryon density @xmath9 , the hubble constant @xmath10 , and the optical depth @xmath11 .",
    "the normalization parameter , denoted @xmath12 in cosmomc , is equivalent to @xmath13 of the textbook by liddle and lyth @xcite , evaluated at the comoving scale @xmath14 at some early epoch while the perturbations are still superhorizon .",
    "this quantity gives the normalization in a way which is independent of the ultimate value of @xmath4 at the present .",
    "we use the related quantity @xmath15 .",
    "the simplest way to define our terminology is to relate it to the perturbations from slow - roll inflation models .",
    "there @xmath16 is given in terms of the hubble parameter @xmath17 and scalar field velocity @xmath18 by ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath19 the right - hand side is to be evaluated at the time when the normalization scale crossed outside the horizon during inflation , which can be estimated following ref .",
    "@xcite . the spectral index and tensor - to - scalar ratio",
    "are given in the slow - roll approximation by @xmath20 where the slow - roll parameters are defined from the potential @xmath21 by @xmath22    to compare with the cobe normalization of ref .",
    "@xcite , one should simply look at the critical - density result given in that case , @xmath23}{\\sqrt{1 + 0.75\\hat{r } } } \\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath24 is quoted at the present horizon scale @xmath25 , and we have used the notation @xmath26 to indicate use of an outdated definition of the tensor - to - scalar ratio , connected to the modern one by @xmath27 . that the dependence on @xmath0 is well approximated by",
    "an exponential implies that there is a scale where the normalization becomes independent of @xmath0 , the pivot scale , here given by @xmath28 .",
    "our result for the normalization is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : norm ] .",
    "generally we find excellent agreement with the cobe normalization ; in particular for @xmath29 and @xmath30 we get @xmath31 , matching the value from the cobe fitting function .",
    "our findings are thus consistent with the conclusion of ref .  @xcite that the wmap measurements of the large angular scale anisotropy show no systematic discrepancy from the cobe measurements .",
    "we find that the results are well fit by the function @xmath32}{\\sqrt{1 + 0.53r } } \\,,\\ ] ] which is the main result of this paper . here",
    "@xmath33 is specified at @xmath34 and hence the coefficients can not be directly compared with those in eq .",
    "( [ e : cobe ] ) .",
    "the criteria for obtaining the fit parameters was the minimization of the maximum relative error over the @xmath0 and @xmath1 values studied .",
    "similar results are obtained by minimizing the average deviation or the chi - squared .",
    "the fitting function is accurate to within one percent for all the values we considered .",
    "the form of the fitting function in eq .",
    "( [ e : wmap ] ) is motivated by the same criteria as for cobe .",
    "if there is a pivot scale where the normalization becomes independent of @xmath0 , the dependence on @xmath0 should be exponential to reflect that translation of scales .",
    "the introduction of @xmath1 suppresses the matter power spectrum , the coefficient of order unity required because @xmath1 is defined by the relative tensor and scalar power spectra rather than precisely by their relative effect on the cmb .",
    "however , with wmap it turns out that there is not a unique pivot scale independent of @xmath1 ; as @xmath1 is introduced the curves shown in fig .",
    "[ f : norm ] become noticeably flatter .",
    "the pivot scale when @xmath30 is @xmath35 , increasing to @xmath36 when @xmath37 ( when @xmath1 is large , the low multipoles contain less information about the matter power spectrum normalization ) .",
    "the @xmath1-dependence in the exponential is necessary to allow for this in the fitting function .",
    "the statistical uncertainty on @xmath38 is independent of @xmath0 and @xmath1 to a good approximation and is 3 percent ( at 68 percent confidence ) , corresponding to about twice the accuracy of cobe .",
    "the two results are entirely consistent with one another .",
    "this uncertainty is also about half of that obtained when marginalizing the amplitude over the posterior distribution of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ; the wmap team quote @xmath39 for the fully - marginalized amplitude in inflationary models @xcite ( this number corresponding to the scale @xmath40 ) .",
    "the precision of the normalization is also affected by the overall calibration uncertainty of the wmap data .",
    "this is estimated to be 0.5 percent in the wmap3 data @xcite , the same level reported for the first - year data .",
    "that number was obtained @xcite by applying an iterative algorithm that simultaneously fits for calibration parameters and sky maps ; using detailed simulations of the time - ordered data they arrive at a conservative estimate of 0.5 percent for the absolute calibration uncertainty .",
    "this calibration uncertainty is well below the statistical uncertainty reported above ( 0.5 percent is the appropriate number for @xmath41 , and would correspond to a 1 percent uncertainty in the power spectrum ) .    having evaluated the effective pivot scale ( for different @xmath1 values ) , it is interesting to know what multipole value it corresponds to , in order to see which part of the data drives the result . to make this relation , we ran a series of cmb spectrum computations using spike power spectra ( @xmath42 ) at different @xmath2 , using the best - fit wmap cosmological parameters @xmath43 .",
    "such a sharp input spectrum gets smeared by projection effects , but we can still pick off the corresponding @xmath3 value where the transfer of power peaks . ( if we instead take the mean @xmath3 , rather than the peak location , the @xmath3 value corresponding to a given @xmath2 is reduced by about 15% . )    the correspondence is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : ktol ] ; ignoring the glitches which coincide with the cmb temperature acoustic troughs , the relation is well fit by @xmath44 using this , we find that the pivot scale for @xmath30 corresponds to @xmath45 , increasing to about 280 for the largest @xmath1 values considered . we conclude that even with wmap the majority of the constraining power on the amplitude is at fairly low @xmath3 , which is why the improvement with respect to cobe is limited . from a physical point of view , cosmic variance limited measurements of the sachs  wolfe effect , because of its microphysics independence , carry the most statistical weight in this context .    on the other hand ,",
    "the pivot scale for the well - determined combination @xmath46 is found to be @xmath47 for @xmath30 , corresponding to an @xmath3 of about 460 , more or less in the middle of the wmap range .",
    "therein lies the justification for currently using @xmath48 for the scalar pivot scale .",
    "currently the cmb acoustic peak region , where the overall level of anisotropy can be best determined , suffers from a perfect degeneracy between the amplitude and the optical depth , broken only towards low @xmath3 .",
    "a better measurement of @xmath11 from cmb polarization will help break this degeneracy , allowing a better determination of @xmath24 and moving its pivot scale up to higher @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath46 is currently known to an accuracy of about @xmath49 percent , so that external constraints on @xmath11 could lead to at most a factor two improvement in our knowledge of @xmath24 with present cmb data .    in single - field slow - roll inflation models ,",
    "the perturbation normalization directly gives the inflationary energy scale in terms of the slow - roll parameter @xmath50 or , equivalently , the tensor - to - scalar ratio .",
    "following the usual calculation ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ) , we find that the energy scale as a given mode crossed the horizon was @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the reduced planck mass . substituting in the wmap normalization of eq .",
    "( [ e : wmap ] ) gives @xmath53}{(1 + 0.53r)^{1/4 } } \\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where ` * ' indicates that this corresponds to when the scale @xmath54 crossed outside the horizon during inflation .",
    "this agrees with previous results , with a smaller uncertainty in the prefactor .",
    "nevertheless , one can not expect the other terms to be measured with anything like the precision of the prefactor , the uncertainty on the @xmath55 being likely to be the limiting term .",
    "in particular applications one should also check whether slow - roll corrections are comparable to or greater than the statistical uncertainty .",
    "we have determined the density power spectrum normalization from wmap , as a function of the inflationary parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this wmap normalization is the one appropriate to specific inflation models , and its statistical uncertainty improves on the cobe normalization by a factor of approximately two .",
