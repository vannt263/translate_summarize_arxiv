    "there is currently a large attention towards topological superconductors , which are expected to host zero - energy states with interesting properties .",
    "these states , known as majorana bound states ( mbss ) , constitute half fermions in the sense that two mbss are needed to define a single fermionic level , where the degree of freedom of this fermion corresponds to the parity of the fermion number .",
    "thus , if the mbss are well separated in space the parity degree of freedom is a topologically protected quantity , which can potentially be used for quantum computation @xcite .",
    "promising candidate systems are hybrid materials where s - wave superconductors are used to proximitizes other materials with strong spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "systems like this have already been studied in a number of experiments @xcite .    an important diagnostic tools to verify",
    "the presence of mbss is tunnel spectroscopy for which the zero - energy bound states are predicted to give resonant andreev reflection and hence a low - temperature conductance of @xmath1 @xcite . with interactions in the normal leads the situation changes because the andreev reflection may be suppressed by repulsive interactions in the metal .",
    "this was studied by fidkowski _",
    "@xcite , who showed that when the normal metal is a luttinger liquid , the resonant andreev reflection is replaced by a non - conducting fixed point for interactions stronger than a critical value .",
    "in particular , the prediction is that for a chiral luttinger liquid the cross - over happens for the luttinger parameter @xmath2 , with the insulating phase occurring for strong interactions , @xmath3 more details of the voltage and temperature dependence were studied later @xcite",
    ". a related study of a point contact between a luttinger liquid and a chiral majorana mode was done in ref .  .",
    "another interesting situation is when the majorana bound state is tunnel coupled to an interacting quantum dot @xcite .",
    "for such a setup the coulomb blockade results in sharper resonance structures in the weak - coupling limit @xcite .",
    "this was shown to hold true also for stronger coupling by cheng _",
    "@xcite , who showed that the perfect andreev reflection dominates over the kondo effect in the strong - coupling fixed point .    .",

    "is a junction between two topological superconductors , where the junction consists of a metallic coulomb blockaded island . ]    in this paper , we analyze the transport properties through mbss via different types of environments , namely ( a ) a general linear electromagnetic environment , ( b ) a metallic quantum dot with a quantum point contact drain , and ( c ) a metallic dot with a second topological superconductor as a drain .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : systems ] for illustrations .",
    "the situation in ( a ) was shown by liu @xcite to exhibit a crossover from conducting to non - conducting when the environment impedance is larger than the resistance of the resonant andreev conductance @xmath4 , and the same results follows in the situation ( b ) when the quantum point contact has less than two open channels .",
    "the nature of this transition is completely analogous to the luttinger - liquid physics studied by fidkowski _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the above transitions occur when the isolated mbs - metal junction resistance and the environment resistance are equal .",
    "this motivates the study of situation ( c ) in fig .  1 where two mbs - metal junctions are connected via a coulomb - blocked metallic island .",
    "because both junctions have resistance @xmath5 , the combined resistance is locked to the transition value and the conductance is temperature independent , similar to a non - interacting scattering problem .",
    "in fact , after integration over charge fluctuations the resulting low - energy model can be solved by mapping to a simple fermionic scattering problem by refermionization .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : bosonization ] , we introduce the key elements of the models , namely a single mbs coupled to a fermion bath and the bosonic electromagnetic environment , and show how these elements are bosonized . in sec .",
    "[ sec : environ ] , the effective low - energy actions is derived and used to identify the crossover impedance .",
    "the tunneling limit is treated in detail in sec .",

    "the current operator is given by @xmath15 because the mbs couples to a particular spin projection of the lead @xcite , we only need to include the corresponding spin direction and we can effectively use a spinless model .",
    "moreover , we take the tunneling matrix element @xmath16 to be independent of @xmath8 ( s - wave scattering ) and , furthermore , assume that the density of states is constant : @xmath17 .",

    "now , from the action ( [ st ] ) we see that the field @xmath49 does not couple to the junction and we can integrate it out .",

    "gets pinned at @xmath130 .",

    "the model is now solvable because it maps to a single non - interacting qpc @xcite .",
    "the spirit of this mapping is equivalent to the solution by furusaki and matveev @xcite , but while they mapped two qpc coupled to a metallic dot to a majorana junction , we here map two majorana junctions connected in series via a metallic dot to a single qpc .",
    "the backscattering matrix element in the qpc model translates to @xmath139 .",
    "moreover , the current operator is @xmath140 for both the original model and for the qpc model .",
    "therefore , we can directly obtain the conductance for the dual model from the qpc result as @xmath141and hence @xmath142 where @xmath143 .",
    "we also define an device asymmetry angle for the weak backscattering limit : @xmath144 and @xmath145 , so that @xmath146    we see that in both the weak tunneling and in the weak backscattering formulations the conductance peaks at the charge neutrality points and reaches @xmath147 for a symmetrically coupled dot , agreeing with the expectation for the series resistance of two resistors each having resistance @xmath5 .",
    "however , in the general case they have different lineshapes .",
    "[ fig : gres ] shows the resulting conductance for the charge projected model and the dual model .    , while the lower curve is the result for weak tunneling formulation ( eq .  ) with @xmath148 , also for a symmetric device . for the weak tunneling case",
    "we have added two curves , one centered at @xmath149 and one centered @xmath150 , corresponding to projection to @xmath151 and @xmath152 , respectively . ]",
    "it is interesting to note that the conductance for the metallic dot coupled to two mbss does not depend on temperature , even though it is an inelastic process .",
    "this is in contrast to the usual inelastic cotunneling in metallic dots , where the conductance is proportional to temperature squared , even in the strong - coupling limit @xcite .",
    "tunneling spectroscopy is an important diagnostic tool for determining the presence and properties of mbss . in this paper , we have studied the influence of interactions with the surrounding circuit on the measured current - voltage characteristics .",
    "confirming the results of ref .  , we obtain a transition from perfect andreev reflection to an isolating state of the normal - metal - mbs junction which can be controlled by the resistance of the circuit .",
    "when the environment resistance exceeds @xmath5 , the linear conductance goes to zero at low temperatures .",
    "we studied two types of environments , namely one that can be described by a linear impedance and a quantum point contact , which allows for direct tuning of the transition .",
    "moreover , we introduced an interesting setup where two mbss are coupled to a metallic island .",
    "this system has the property that the linear cotunneling current is temperature independent , which is very different from the usual cotunneling current through a metallic dot coupled to two metallic electrodes . in the latter case ,",
    "the cotunneling current is proportional to temperature squared due to the phase space of final states with an electron - hole pair created at each contact . in contrast , with two mbs junctions connecting the dot , the integral over final states involving a single electron - hole pair also involves the divergent resonant andreev reflections and , as a result , produces a temperature independent conductance .",
    "the metallic dot case is related to coulomb blockade of a topological superconducting island considered by fu @xcite and it can be solved in a similar way after projection onto two charge states . furthermore , the temperature independent result turns out to be linked to a mapping to an effective low - energy model consisting of a 1d non - interacting fermion model with a single impurity .",
    "this mapping allowed us to derive a non - perturbative result for the low - temperature coulomb blockade traces as a function of gate voltage .",
    "finally , it is interesting to note that if the metallic island in this setup has more connecting mbss , the system is an `` inverse out '' version of the topological kondo effect system recently analyzed by several authors @xcite .",
