    "the first theoretical idea of neutron stars comes from baade and zwicky @xcite , being based on the analysis of supernova explosions . according to",
    ", supernova explosion could be a transition from a star to a neutron star , consisting of closely packed neutrons in a compact size object .",
    "after a few years , the derivation of the full general relativistic equation of hydrostatic equilibrium for spherically symmetric objects , now known as _ tolman - oppenheiemer - volkoff _ ( tov ) equation @xcite came into figure .",
    "these equations were solved by oppenheimer and volkoff @xcite assuming that the matter consisted of non - interacting neutrons , and found that the maximal allowed mass for this to be 0.71@xmath3 .",
    "later it was noticed that the inclusion of nuclear energy from the interacting neutrons increases this value substantially @xcite .",
    "observational proof for the existence of neutron star was succeeded by jocelyn bell and and antony hewish in 1967 by observing the pulsating radio beams from objects named pulsars , the rotating neutron stars with a strong magnetic field @xcite .",
    "generally , the behavior of matter in the interior of a neutron star is governed by the internal pressure , where all the neutrons obey the @xmath2-equilibrium condition with leptons and protons .",
    "an extended review of theoretical and observational aspects of neutron star , from the surface to the core , with the emphasis on their structure and equations of state can be found in ref . @xcite .",
    "further it is well known that the integral parameter for a foolproof structure of neutron star depends on their equation of state from an ideal theory , which can explain the @xmath2-equilibrium condition at high density . at present , a wide spectrum of different eos for neutron star matters has been designed from different interactions such as skyrme @xcite , the akmal - pandharipande - ravenhall @xcite and the relativistic mean field theory ( rmf ) @xcite ( see , e.g. , @xcite for reviews and the references therein for details ) .",
    "an extensive investigation on the eos from these models show that they have almost similar properties at the nuclear saturation density ( matter where the density of protons is equal to that of the neutrons , @xmath4 ) @xmath5 0.16 @xmath6 but differ substantially at high density .",
    "in other words , the properties of nuclear matter predicted from different models have analogous behavior around the saturation density but extremely different from each other at high density under @xmath2-equilibrium .",
    "the recently observed massive neutron stars , j1614 - 2230 ( with mass of 1.97@xmath7 0.04@xmath3 ) @xcite and j0348 + 0432 ( with mass of 2.01@xmath7 0.04@xmath3 ) @xcite , have provided a reliable information on the existence of massive compact stars . at present , the uncertainties are quite large in the radius of compact stars @xcite . for example , using the pulse phase - resolved x - ray spectroscopy for pulsar j0437 - 4715 gives the radius of the compact star @xmath1 @xmath8 11 km with 3@xmath9 uncertainty @xcite .",
    "furthermore , at high densities it is well known that there might be substantial population of heavy baryons ( i.e. hyperons ) , because these become energetically favorable once the fermi energy of neutrons reaches the order of their rest mass .",
    "hence , it becomes quite necessary to include the hyperon matter in the study of highly dense compact objects .",
    "in the last few decades , a large number of systematic studies including hyperon in the nuclear matter ( i.e. , hyper - nuclear matter or hyperon matter ) were carried out _ before _ @xmath10 _",
    "after _ the observation of the pulsars and their identification with the neutron stars @xcite . most of these works demonstrate that the mass of the compact stars is reduced by 0.4@xmath3 when contribution of the hyperon matter is included in the eos , challenging the knowledge of the perceived modern mass @xcite .",
    "this reduction in the mass of the compact stars due to hyperon matter in the eos under @xmath2-equilibrium is known as _",
    "hyperon puzzle _ @xcite .",
    "besides the calculation performed by including the @xmath11-@xmath12 cross - coupling and quartic terms in the rmf softens the eos to good agreement with the recent observed mass of compact stars @xcite .",
    "in addition to that the generalized model having the low lying octet of baryons makes it difficult to obtain a neutron star mass greater than 2.0@xmath3 @xcite . in continuation of our earlier work @xcite , we here analyze the rotational attributes of neutron star with various hyperon - meson couplings within the framework of effective field theory motivated relativistic mean field model ( e - rmf ) @xcite . in brief , the motivation behind the present work is to investigate the effects of rotational profiles in the hyperon matter under @xmath2-equilibrium condition at high density .    within the present scenario of the neutron star formation , the first millisecond pulsar b1937 + 21 rotating at frequency 641 hz @xcite , remained the most rapidly one for more than two decades . in 2006 , the discovery of pulsar j1748 - 2446ad with a faster rotating of frequency 716 hz was announced @xcite .",
    "later observations of x - ray burst xte j1739 - 285 noticed a formation of neutron star with an initial rotation frequency @xmath13 1122 hz @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the young pulsars has been known to have rotational frequency @xmath14 10 hz and in this category ( according to the observations so far ) psr j0537 - 6910 is known to be the fastest with @xmath15 62 hz @xcite . in fact , the angular velocity distribution of a neutron star evolves to a uniform rotation within a very short time period in any supernova event @xcite .",
    "moreover , the sub - khz frequencies are still too low to significantly affects the structure of massive neutron stars @xcite .",
    "however , for rapid rotation i.e. the sub - millisecond pulsar with super - khz frequencies , the rotation affects the massive neutron stars . reviewing the works concerning the rapidly rotating stars in general relativity",
    ", there are few pioneering predictions , which have been observed by considering some of the sophisticated aspects of the neutron star : the nuclear equation of state , magnetic fields , magnetic field breaking and meridional flows etc .",

    "the elementary theory for strong interaction to represent the complete description of nuclear equation of state is quantum chromodyanmics ( qcd ) . at present , it is not conceivable to describe the complete picture of the hadronic matter due to its non - peturbative properties . hence , one need to endorse the perception of effective field theory ( eft ) at low energy , known as quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) @xcite .",

    "in the interior of neutron stars , the neutron chemical potential goes beyond the total mass of the proton and electron . in other words , a probabilistic neutron star composition of neutron star",
    "is asymmetric matter with an admixture of electrons rather than pure neutron matter .",
    "here we have considered the @xmath2-equilibrium @xmath50 and the charge neutrality condition to monitor the concentrations of neutrons , protons and electrons inside the star .",

    "<S> in this theoretical study , we report an investigation of the equations of state ( eoss ) of hyper - nuclear matter and its composition as a function of density within the framework of effective field theory motivated relativistic mean field model . </S>",
    "<S> we have used g2 force parameter along with various hyperon - meson coupling ratios by allowing the mixing and the breaking of su(6 ) symmetry to predict the eoss , keeping the nucleonic coupling constant intact . </S>",
    "<S> we have estimated the properties of non - rotating and rapidly rotating configuration of compact stars by employing a representative set of equations of state . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained results of the mass @xmath0 and radius @xmath1 for the compact stars are compared with the recent mass observations . </S>",
    "<S> we noticed that the inclusion of hyperon matter to the eoss of nuclear matter under @xmath2-equilibrium condition decreases the maximum mass of the compact star by 0.4@xmath3 in magnitude in comparison to the nuclear matter prediction . </S>",
    "<S> further , we have studied the stability and sensitivity of rotational frequency ( at sub - millisecond period ) on the configuration of the compact stars , because the angular frequency is significantly smaller than the mass - shedding ( keplerian ) frequency in slow rotation regime . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the yield of hyperon as a function of density for various hypeon - meson couplings are also estimated . </S>"
