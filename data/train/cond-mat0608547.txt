    "the o(@xmath0 ) model consists of @xmath0-component spins @xmath1 on a lattice , with isotropic , i.e. , o(@xmath0 ) invariant couplings .",
    "the common form of the reduced hamiltonian of the o(@xmath0 ) spin model is @xmath2 where the indices @xmath3 and @xmath4 represent lattice sites , and the sum is over all nearest neighbor pairs ; @xmath5 is the coupling constant , @xmath6 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath7 is the temperature .",
    "thus , the partition function of the model is @xmath8 where the spins are normalized such that this model includes as special cases the ising , the xy and the heisenberg model , for @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .    in the high - temperature limit",
    ", the bond weight @xmath12 reduces in first order to @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "thus the partition function takes the form @xmath15 the bond weight still satisfies the o(@xmath0 ) symmetry implied by eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) . according to the assumption of universality ,",
    "the universality class of a phase transition is determined by only very few parameters including the symmetry of the spin - spin interactions .",
    "it is thus reasonable to expect @xcite that the reduced hamiltonian that corresponds with eq .",
    "( [ spinpartition ] ) , namely @xmath16 with @xmath14 not necessarily small , still belongs to the o(@xmath0 ) universality class in two dimensions .",
    "the o(@xmath0 ) model ( [ spinpartition ] ) on the honeycomb lattice can be mapped on the o(@xmath0 ) loop model @xcite on the same lattice , with a partition sum @xmath17 where the graph @xmath18 covers @xmath19 bonds of the lattice , and consists of @xmath20 closed , non - intersecting loops .    in the language of the @xmath21 loop model , @xmath22 is the weight of a bond visited by a loop , and @xmath0 is the loop weight , and no longer restricted to be an integer .",
    "the research of o(@xmath0 ) models is a subject of a considerable history , in which a prominent place is occupied by the exact results @xcite for the o(@xmath0 ) loop model on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "these results include the critical points for @xmath23 , and the temperature and the magnetic exponent .",
    "also the geometric description of fluctuations at and near criticality has a long history , which goes back to the formulation of phase transitions in terms of the droplet model @xcite . for the @xmath24-state potts model ( for a review ,",
    "see ref .  )",
    ", it was found that the fractal dimension of kasteleyn - fortuin ( kf ) clusters @xcite is equal to the magnetic scaling exponent @xmath25 . more generally ,",
    "geometric potts clusters can be defined by connecting neighboring , equal potts spins by a bond percolation process .",
    "several new critical exponents were found by coulomb gas and other methods @xcite .",
    "these exponents describe the geometric properties and the renormalization flow of this model .    for the o(@xmath0 )",
    "loop model , the fractal dimension @xmath26 of the critical loop gas has , to our knowledge , not yet been derived explicitly .",
    "however , a clue can be obtained from the relation @xcite between the exponents describing random clusters of the tricritical potts model , and those describing potts clusters in the critical potts model . from the equivalence of the critical o(@xmath0 ) model and the tricritical @xmath27-state potts model @xcite",
    ", one can thus associate the fractal dimension @xmath26 of the critical o(@xmath0 ) loop gas to the hull fractal dimension of critical potts clusters .",
    "the latter dimension was conjectured by vanderzande @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on a fundamental non - thermodynamic scaling dimension behind the geometric properties of o(@xmath0 ) loops which follows from the known correspondence with the coulomb gas @xcite , and relate it to some exponents describing such properties .",
    "these exponents are exact and include the fractal dimension @xmath26 of o(@xmath0 ) loops at criticality . from a similar calculation , duplantier and",
    "saleur @xcite derived the fractal dimension @xmath28 of the interior of these loops .",
    "while theoretical predictions are available , thus far there is no numerical evidence in support of these , except for the ising case @xmath9 or @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "one of the reasons behind this situation may be that the o(@xmath0 ) partition sum contains the number of loops . in the existing monte carlo algorithm for the loop model @xcite , the acceptance probability of a local update",
    "thus depends ( for @xmath30 ) on the change of the number of loops due to the monte carlo move .",
    "the determination of this number is a nonlocal task and requires a number of operations that increases algebraically with the system size @xmath31 .",
    "critical slowing down can make this situation even worse , so that this way of simulation is restricted to rather small system sizes .    until now , a sufficiently efficient monte carlo algorithm for the o(@xmath0 ) loop model has not been described .",
    "therefore , in this work , we develop a new monte carlo algorithm , which is applicable to models with noninteger @xmath32 , and uses local updates .",
    "although these updates typically lead to nonlocal modifications of the loop connectivities , the number of operations required per update is only of order one , and essentially independent of the system size .",
    "we then apply the algorithm to the critical o(@xmath0 ) loop model and determine exponents of some geometric observables .",
    "the results agree with the theoretical predictions .",
    "the outline of the rest of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ cg ] we show how a fundamental non - thermodynamic scaling dimension behind some geometric properties of o(@xmath0 ) loops can be derived exactly from a mapping on the coulomb gas , and how it relates to exponents describing some geometric observables . section [ mc ] introduces the monte carlo algorithm . in sec .",
    "[ sim ] we apply the algorithm to the critical o(@xmath0 ) loop model and determine exponents of some geometric observables .",
    "it is well known that geometric and fractal properties of o(@xmath0 ) loops and various types of critical clusters can be analyzed by means of a mapping on the coulomb gas @xcite .",
    "a number of exact scaling dimensions was obtained by this technique , see e.g. , refs .  .",
    "here we base ourselves on these analyses , which rely on a reformulation of correlation functions @xmath33 in the model of interest in terms of the coulomb gas .",
    "the dimensions @xmath34 associated with such correlation functions are described by pairs of electric and magnetic charges , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , separated by a distance @xmath37 : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the coupling constant of the coulomb gas . for the critical o(@xmath0 )",
    "model it is given by @xmath40 where we use a normalization that is in agreement with earlier literature but different from that used in ref .",
    "( our @xmath39 is four times smaller , and the charges differ by a factor two such that the @xmath34 are the same ) .",
    "let us now consider the correlation function at criticality describing the probability that two lattice edges separated by a distance @xmath37 are part of the same loop .",
    "it decays with an exponent @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the o(@xmath0 ) loop scaling dimension .",
    "the exponent @xmath42 is described by a pair of magnetic charges @xmath43 and a pair of electric charges @xmath44 .",
    "this leads to @xmath45 this dimension @xmath42 is the renormalization exponent behind geometrical and fractal properties of o(@xmath0 ) loops , just as the renormalization exponents @xmath46 and @xmath47 determine the thermodynamic singularities .    in another application of the coulomb gas technique we can explore corrections to scaling associated @xcite with the exponent @xmath48 that describes the decay of the probability that two o(@xmath0 ) loops collide in two points separated by a distance @xmath37",
    "the value of this exponent is determined by electric charges as above and magnetic charges @xmath49 : @xmath50 this exponent becomes marginal at @xmath51 and is thus expected to lead to poor convergence of finite - size data near @xmath51 .",
    "the physical relevance of @xmath42 can be demonstrated by means of scaling arguments . the probability @xmath52 that two points at a distance @xmath37 lie on the same loop is , as given above , @xmath53 .",
    "let , at criticality , the fractal dimension of the loops be @xmath26 . thus , under a rescaling by a linear factor @xmath54 , the length @xmath55 of the loop decreases by a factor @xmath56 , and its density increases by a factor @xmath57 .",
    "this determines the correlation in the rescaled system as @xmath58 which is , as specified above , to be compared with @xmath59 .",
    "it thus follows that the fractal dimension of loops is @xmath60    let @xmath61 be the density of loops of length @xmath55 .",
    "it is natural that , at criticality , @xmath61 depends algebraically on @xmath55 , with an exponent denoted as @xmath62 : @xmath63 under a rescaling by a linear factor @xmath54 , the loop density is affected for two reasons : first , the loops decrease in length by a factor @xmath64 ; and second , the density increases by a factor @xmath65 because the volume is reduced .",
    "consistency requires that @xmath66 or @xmath67 . the requirement @xmath68 yields @xmath69 . matching the exponents",
    "shows that @xmath70 since scaling implies that the divergence of the expectation value of the linear size of the largest loop goes as @xmath71 when the critical point is approached , and the actual length @xmath72 as expressed in lattice edges behaves as a power @xmath73 of the linear size , it follows that the largest loop length diverges as @xmath74    for @xmath75 and @xmath76 , there exists an infinite spanning loop . under a rescaling by a linear scale factor",
    "@xmath54 its density increases by a factor @xmath77 while , as usual , the temperature field @xmath78 scales as @xmath79 .",
    "the fraction @xmath80 of the edges covered by the spanning loop scales as @xmath81 .",
    "the choice @xmath82 leads to a constant on the left hand side of this equation , and after substitution in the right hand side , the scaling behavior follows as @xmath83 the finite - size dependence of the similar fraction @xmath84 of a system with finite size @xmath31 at criticality can simply be found by rescaling the system to a given size , say 1 .",
    "this leads to @xmath85 including a correction to scaling , we may modify this into @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a candidate for the leading correction exponent @xcite , and @xmath88 and @xmath54 are unknown amplitudes .    in analogy with magnetic systems",
    ", a susceptibility - like quantity @xmath89 can be defined on the basis of the distribution of the loop sizes as @xmath90 according to the aforementioned scaling behavior , the largest loop in a critical system of finite size @xmath31 has a length scale @xmath91 .",
    "thus @xmath92 substitution of @xmath93 yields @xmath94 again , we can include corrections to scaling @xmath95 with @xmath96 as mentioned above , and @xmath97 and @xmath98 are unknown constants .",
    "another correlation function of interest describes the probability that two sites on the dual triangular lattice separated by a distance @xmath37 sit inside the same loop ( i.e. , not separated by any loop of the model ) .",
    "the exponent @xmath99 describing the decay of this function at criticality was derived by duplantier and saleur @xcite as @xmath100 .",
    "the fractal dimension of the interior of o(@xmath0 ) loops is therefore @xmath101 .",
    "the area inside a loop does not include the area inside loops enclosed by that loop .",
    "the exponent @xmath99 thus also determines the finite - size scaling of the spanning loop .",
    "we are therefore interested in the fraction @xmath102 of the dual lattice sites that sit inside the spanning loop .",
    "scaling indicates that this quantity is subject to the following finite - size behavior : @xmath103 we furthermore define another susceptibility - like quantity @xmath104 on the basis of the distribution @xmath105 of the area @xmath88 ( expressed in the number of enclosed sites of the dual lattice ) of the interior of the loops as @xmath106 which is expected to scale as @xmath107",
    "in the existing monte carlo algorithm for the loop model @xcite , the local updates require time - consuming nonlocal operations as explained above . to get rid of these we adopt the following procedure .    as a first step of such an algorithm for the simulation of the o(@xmath0 ) loop model on the honeycomb lattice",
    ", we represent the loop configuration by means of ising spins on the dual lattice , which is triangular .",
    "the loops are just the interfaces between neighboring spins of a different sign . we restrict ourselves to systems with periodic boundary conditions , so that the interfaces indeed form a system of closed , nonintersecting loops loops on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ cfg1 ] using a loop configuration which consists of 2 loops and 16 bonds , shown as bold lines .",
    "this graph contributes a weight @xmath108 to the partition function .",
    "the loops can of course be represented by two opposite ising spin configuration , but this degeneracy has no further consequences for our line of argument .",
    "we now show how one can update the loop configuration by means of local metropolis - type updates of the ising spins representing the loop configuration .",
    "it works only for @xmath109 .",
    "one step of importance sampling is realized by the following operations , which are to be repeated cyclically :    1 .   for each loop , assign its color to be either green with probability @xmath110 or red with the remaining probability @xmath111 .",
    "2 .   randomly select an ising spin on the dual lattice .",
    "3 .   check if the spin is adjacent to a red loop segment . if so , do nothing ; if not , update the spin using the metropolis probabilities , with ising couplings @xmath112 determined as @xmath113 .",
    "repeat steps 2 and 3 until the number of update attempts is equal to the number of sites of the dual lattice .",

    "each of these steps satisfies the conditions of detailed balance , so that the algorithm should indeed generate configurations in accordance with boltzmann statistics .",

    "the time - consuming character of simulations of loop models is due to the nonlocal character of the loops .",
    "we have reduced this problem by splitting the loop weight @xmath0 in two parts , namely @xmath154 and @xmath141 .",
    "proper summation over both contributions is done by assigning color variables to the loops ; a sum on all color variables is included in the partition sum .",
    "the algorithm treats these color variables as dynamical variables which are updated by the monte carlo process .",
    "the idea to use an additional color variable for each loop was already used in a context unrelated to monte carlo methods , e.g. in ref .  .",
    "the presence of loops of weight 1 in such a configuration then leads , at least locally , to a system that behaves precisely as an ising configuration .",
    "thus , the system may be locally updated by means of metropolis - like monte carlo steps .",

    "the existing algorithm @xcite is , although relatively inefficient , still applicable .    for the interpretation of the simulation results ,",
    "it is relevant that we are using periodic boundary conditions , and that the mapping between loop and ising configurations imposes a condition of ` evenness ' on the loop configurations : a path spanning the periodic boundaries must have an even number of intersections with a loop .",

    "the difference is related to the boundary conditions and is expected to modify the finite - size behavior , but should vanish in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the present work is restricted to the ` even ' loop configurations .",
    "it is , however , possible to simulate ` odd ' loop configurations by introducing a ` seam ' on the dual lattice , a vertical column of horizontal antiferromagnetic ising bonds spanning the system . for these antiferromagnetic bonds we use the rule",
