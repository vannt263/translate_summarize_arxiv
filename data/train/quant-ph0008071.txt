    "optical parametric oscillators ( opo s ) based on processes of down - conversion in a cavity have proved to be efficient sources of light with a range of unique properties . among them",
    "it should be noted the nonclassical nature of light , including quantum correlations , sub - poissonian statistics and a larger amount of squeezing @xcite .",
    "opo provides a method for producing tunable radiation from a coherent fixed - frequency pump source in the intracavity down - conversion , where a pump - photon splits into a pair of subharmonic photons .",
    "so far opo has only been realized experimentally for two - photon down - conversion in nonlinear media with second - order @xmath0 susceptibility .",
    "experimental and theoretical results can be found in @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we propose a new conception for the realization of multiphoton parametric oscillators using the idea of composite multiphoton interaction .",
    "two schemes of opo based accordingly on a three - photon and four - photon intracavity down - conversion are presented .",
    "one of the principal motivations for the investigation of multiphoton opo concerns to a production of nonclassical states of light with the novel features .",
    "other motivation is their possible exploitation for quantum information technologies , because sources offering a great variety of multiparticle entangled states , first of all meaning photons , are required for the implementation of many quantum communication processes such as direct transmission of the state , quantum teleportation , quantum cryptography , and entanglement swapping @xcite .",
    "it is known that two - photon down - conversion so far is the most standard source of pair of polarization - entangled photons which is relevant to many problems of quantum information ( see , previous experiments on photon splitting in @xcite , and for polarization - entangled photon pairs @xcite ) .",
    "although two - particle entanglement has long been demonstrated experimentally the realization of entanglement between three or more particles has been considered as a difficult problem . among the possible sources of three - photon states ( so - called greenberger - horne - zeilinger states",
    "@xcite ) we mention the process of degenerate three - photon down - conversion @xmath1 in a @xmath2 medium .",
    "this process has been studied for running waves @xcite .",
    "note , that most recently the polarization entanglement for three spatially separated photons has been observed @xcite .",
    "three - photon down - conversion in an optical cavity has also been proposed and investigated in @xcite , but too weak interaction between photons in @xmath2 medium makes experimental realization of this scheme a difficult problem . as regards to a four - photon splitting @xmath3 in a @xmath4 medium , as we know , this process was not considered yet .",
    "this letter reports the analysis of two schemes of multiphoton opo in a double resonant - mode cavity involving two crystals of second - order susceptibilities .",
    "they are the following :      the scheme proposed contains two sequential nonlinear processes of degenerate two - photon splitting in @xmath0 media taking place inside the same cavity .",
    "this scheme for the special configuration when the coupling in- and out - fields occurs at one of the ring cavity mirrors is shown in fig.1 .",
    "the pump frequency @xmath5 is converted to the subharmonic frequency @xmath6 and then into the frequency @xmath7 in the cascaded parametric processes @xmath8 and",
    "@xmath9 we assume that the each of these processes takes place effectively only in the definite nonlinear crystal .",
    "the cavity is also assumed transparent at the pump frequency .",
    "so , we neglect the pump depletion effects considering the amplitude of driving field as a classical constant .",
    "we model the combination of these processes by the interaction hamiltonian : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the operators of the modes @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the nonlinear coupling constants for the processes @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively which are related to second - order nonlinear susceptibilities @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath19 is proportional to the coherent driving field amplitude .",
    "this system mainly is similar to the previous one .",
    "the only difference is that the pump frequency @xmath5 converts to two different frequencies@xmath20 and @xmath21 in the parametric interaction @xmath22 the subharmonic @xmath13 is also produced in the other process of down conversion @xmath23 on the whole two subharmonic modes @xmath24 and @xmath21  are created in the cavity due to the cascaded processes . in the undepleted pump field configuration this model",
    "is described by the following interaction hamiltonian : @xmath25 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the operators of @xmath13 and @xmath26 subharmonics@xmath27 and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the coupling constants of the processes @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively@xmath32    we note , that optical schemes involving cascaded nonlinearities in a cavity are currently of considerable interest and hold promise for applications including , in particular , frequency tunable sources of light , large third - order nonlinear effects via cascaded second - order nonlinearities and squeezing phenomena .",
    "the references and experimental observation can be found in @xcite .",
    "possible operational regimes of a combined system , as a rule , essentially differ from those in pure processes in each of nonlinear media .",
    "some results in this direction are devoted to the cascaded frequency doubler @xcite .",
    "concerning our schemes , it is interesting to note , that the stable stationary above - threshold regime of oscillation is realized even in undepleted pump regime .",
    "the other novelty here is comparatively low values of the threshold of generation due to the schemes proposed can be accessible for experiments .",
    "contrary to polarization - entangled state generation in two- and three - photon devices @xcite the basic multiphoton states of our systems are neither based on polarization nor on momentum , but on phase - space entanglement of modes .",
    "the system of interest is dissipative because the subharmonic modes suffer losses due to partially transmission of light through the mirrors of the cavity .",
    "so that the reduced density operator @xmath33 of both modes obeys a master equation @xmath34 + \\sum_{i=1,2}\\gamma _ { i}(2a_{i}\\rho a_{i}^{\\dagger } -a_{i}^{\\dagger } a_{i}\\rho -\\rho a_{i}^{\\dagger } a_{i } ) ,   \\label{master1}\\ ] ] where @xmath35  and @xmath36  are the cavity damping rates for the modes @xmath13 and @xmath37    to proceed with further analysis we present now the semiclassical steady - state solutions and stability properties of the system proposed . in the classical limit the system may be described by the complex - field amplitudes @xmath38 and @xmath39 of the resonant modes @xmath40 and @xmath41 whose real and imaginary parts respectively represent the dimensionless position and momentum .",
    "they obey the equation of motion : @xmath42 solving these equations for the steady - state regime and carrying out the standard linearized stability analysis one can arrive at the following results .",
    "the trivial zero - amplitude solution @xmath43  is stable in the region @xmath44 @xmath45 with @xmath46 being the threshold value of the pump field amplitude , and it describes the below - threshold regime of oscillation of both subharmonics .",
    "the stable above - threshold solutions , for @xmath47 , expressed in terms of photon numbers @xmath48 and phases @xmath49 of subharmonic modes ( @xmath50 ) are calculated as : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the phase of the driving field .",
    "so , this scheme of multiphoton opo allows us to reach stable generation of subharmonics at frequencies @xmath53 and @xmath54  at @xmath47 in undepleted pump - field regime .",
    "it should be pointed out that the occurrence of such a regime of oscillation becomes possible just due to the combination of two kinds of down - conversion processes in a cavity .",
    "one of the peculiarities of cascading dynamics is that the threshold pump power @xmath55 ( @xmath56 is the optical way of pump field ) is only related to the coupling constant @xmath15 of @xmath57 parametric process .",
    "this coupling constant is proportional to the second - order susceptibility that leads to the comparatively low value of the threshold .",
    "we illustrate this fact for the system depicted in fig.1 , choosing realistic losses and typical values of @xmath58 and @xmath16 ( see detailed calculations for a similar cavity configuration in @xcite ) . assuming @xmath59",
    "@xmath60  , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , we find for the threshold pump power @xmath63 . for these parameters",
    "the power of the cavity output field of @xmath64 mode increases as @xmath65 , while the output power of the @xmath66  subharmonic remains constant @xmath67    a very important characteristic of multiphoton opo concerning phase information of the generated modes , is displayed in phase - space .",
    "as we see from ( [ phase1 ] ) , the stationary states of  @xmath68  subharmonic have four - fold symmetry .",
    "there are four stable states of @xmath13 mode with equal photon numbers , but with four different phases which are :",
    "@xmath69 as regards to @xmath70  subharmonic mode , it displays two - fold symmetry in phase - space , i.e. there exist two states with equal intensities but with different phases @xmath71    let us now show the general character of this symmetry in the frame of a full quantum treatment of interaction .",
    "it is easy to verify that the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) as well as the density operator @xmath33 obeying eq.([master1 ] ) satisfy the commutation relations@xmath72@xmath73 = \\left [ \\rho ( t),u\\right ] = 0   \\label{sym1}\\ ] ] with the operator @xmath74 for the reduced density operators of each of the modes @xmath75 ( which are constructed by tracing over one of the modes ) , relations@xmath76([sym1 ] ) give@xmath72@xmath77 = \\left [ \\rho _ { 2}(t),u_{2}(\\pi ) \\right ] = 0 ,   \\label{symr}\\ ] ] where operators@xmath78 perform rotation by the angle @xmath79 around the origin in phase - space of complex stochastic variables @xmath38 and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "one of the most important conclusions of such symmetries is related to the wigner functions @xmath81 and @xmath82 of the subharmonic modes @xmath13 and @xmath41 which provide a large amount of information about the states of the mode and also provide a pictorial view . to see this we address to the formula for wigner function expressed through the density operator .",
    "using also formulas ( [ symr ] ) we arrive to the symmetries of wigner functions written through the stochastic mode amplitudes @xmath38 and @xmath80 corresponding the operators @xmath11 and @xmath83 in the polar coordinates @xmath84 of the complex phase - space plane @xmath85 @xmath86 these symmetries take the forms : @xmath87  we have obtained this property of wigner functions using the symmetry of hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) and dissipation terms in master equation ( [ master1 ] ) , assuming that the initial state of the modes is a vacuum state .",
    "below , we will present the other confirmation to phase - space symmetry in quantum trajectories .",
    "the dynamics of subharmonic modes @xmath24 and @xmath88 for this system is governed by master equation ( [ master1 ] ) involving hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) instead of hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) .",
    "accordingly , the classical equations of motion for the complex amplitudes are @xmath89    we list below the semiclassical results for stable values of photon numbers and phases of the modes . in the above - threshold generation regime , at @xmath90 , where    @xmath91    is the threshold value of e , the results take the form : @xmath92 where @xmath93 @xmath94    in the region @xmath95 the stability condition is fulfilled only for a zero amplitude steady - state solution @xmath96 i.e. the subharmonic field excitation exists at the spontaneous noise level .",
    "the photon numbers are plotted against the pump amplitude in fig.2 .",
    "they show bistable hysteresis - cycle behavior in a small domain @xmath97 the dashed parts of the curves correspond to unstable solutions . as we see , with increasing @xmath98 the photon number of the @xmath99  subharmonic increases as @xmath100 , while the photon number of the @xmath101  subharmonic goes to the saturated value @xmath102    the very important peculiarity of the system proposed is that the threshold value @xmath46 depends on the coupling constant @xmath28 which is related to the second - order @xmath0 susceptibility in contrary to the scheme cited in @xcite , where the threshold of the driving field amplitude is determined by @xmath2 susceptibility .",
    "however , the photon numbers of the generated modes depend on both nonlinear coupling constants @xmath28 and @xmath29 . for the realistic parameters : @xmath103 @xmath104 @xmath105 , @xmath106 parametric oscillations occur above the threshold pump power @xmath107 and the threshold values of cavity - output field powers are @xmath108 @xmath109",
    ". eqs.([upper]),([upperf ] ) imply that in the above - bistability regime there exist three states for each of the modes which have equal intensities @xmath110 and @xmath111 but different phases : @xmath112 and @xmath113 respectively .",
    "surprisingly , both the modes @xmath24  and @xmath114 have the identical threefold symmetry which also follows from the specific three - photon form of hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) . in the full quantum treatment",
    "of cascaded three - photon down - conversion this symmetry , in particular , is displayed in the wigner functions . following the method presented above ,",
    "we have obtained : @xmath115",
    "the second part of this paper is devoted to the study of quantum - statistical properties of cascaded multiphoton opo in a dissipative cavity .",
    "our aim is to analyze the phase - space properties of the subharmonic modes in a quantum regime in the presence of quantum noise on the basis of the wigner functions .",
    "note that an exact analysis of quantum optical nonlinear systems including dissipation effects is a difficult problem which was solved for a few single models ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in this field of research , analytical expression for the wigner function of two - photon opo was derived in @xcite .",
    "however the quantum - statistical properties of cascaded opo s can not be analyzed using single analytical formulas .",
    "our approach is based on the quantum - jump simulation method also known as the state - vector monte - carlo method @xcite .",
    "this method considers not the density matrix but deals with the state vector @xmath116 which is a member of the ensemble of state vectors and index @xmath117 indicates the realizations .",
    "the procedure adopted in the quantum - jump simulation for the system hamiltonians ( [ ham1 ] ) and ( [ ham2 ] ) consists in the following",
    ". the evolution of a member of the ensemble of pure states @xmath118 over a short time @xmath119 is governed by the non - hermitian effective hamiltonian if there is no quantum jump @xmath120    such evolution must be completed by the possibility of quantum jumps which change the state vectors of both modes . on the whole",
    "the state transforms in the following way @xmath121 where @xmath122    we generalize the method presented in @xcite for the quantum - jump simulation of the wigner functions .",
    "details of analogous calculations for the second harmonic generation can be found in @xcite.the numerical simulations are performed in the truncated fock basis of both subharmonic modes @xmath13  and @xmath41  in the regime of strong nonlinear coupling between the subharmonic modes , i.e. @xmath123  and @xmath124 .",
    "we note that the opo with such extremely large nonlinearities are not realized in practice and in this part of the letter we do not intend to give results close to an experimental situation but discuss the fundamental problems of multiphoton entangled states .    to be short",
    ", we shall give the results for three - photon opo , where one kind of phase - space symmetries is realized .",
    "the steady - state wigner functions for @xmath24  and @xmath21 modes are calculated in the basis of @xmath125 photon number states for each mode .",
    "the results may be written as depending on the dimensionless parameters : @xmath126 we calculate the wigner functions of @xmath24 subharmonic averaged over 1000 trajectories in the complex phase  space plane @xmath127 it is obvious that below the threshold the wigner function is single - humped and centered at @xmath128 .",
    "this state indicates appearance of three arms as the consequence of small entanglement between the modes .",
    "increasing the driving field @xmath19 we enter the bistability domain and observe the occurrence of three additional side - humps .",
    "they correspond to the above - threshold steady - states ( 12 ) , ( 13 ) with equal photon numbers and threefold symmetric phases .",
    "we see explicitly that in this domain the behavior of our system is actually four - stable . with further increase of @xmath98",
    "the central hump disappears , while the side - humps increase and we turn to a manifestly above threshold oscillation regime when we observe the phase space three - stability .",
    "this case is shown in fig.3 for the parameters @xmath129 .",
    "analogous behavior has the wigner function of @xmath101-subharmonic .. the difference between the results of two modes is displayed in the form of squeezing the humps .",
    "thus we have shown that the idea of using the cascaded photon splitting processes in a cavity opens a novel route for the realization of a multiphoton parametric oscillator .",
    "two devices are proposed which transform the pump coherent field into two subharmonics at frequencies @xmath70 and @xmath68 ( configuration a ) and @xmath99 and @xmath101 ( configuration b ) .",
    "furthermore , these models of opo are to be subject to an experiment .",
    "we have been convinced that the pump threshold of each of the opo is only expressed through the second - order susceptibility . as a result",
    ", comparatively low values of thresholds have been obtained for typical parameters .",
    "the important features of multiphoton opo obtained are phase - space symmetries and multistabilities of subharmonics .",
    "in addition , it is shown that subharmonics ",
    "remember  the phase of the pump field .",
    "our numerical quantum monte - carlo simulations display phase - space multistabilities and threshold behavior of subharmonics in the presence of dissipation .",
