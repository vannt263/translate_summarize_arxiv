    "supersymmetric ( susy ) models of particle physics are very attractive in that they stabilize the gauge hierarchy problem , and provide an avenue for the incorporation of gravity via local susy , or supergravity@xcite .",

    "if evidence for susy is found at lhc , then a paramount question will be : what is the mechanism of susy breaking , and how is it communicated to the visible sector ? some of the possibilities proposed in the literature include : gravity - mediation ( sugra ) with a gravitino mass @xmath5 tev@xcite , gauge - mediation ( gmsb ) with @xmath6 tev@xcite , and anomaly mediation ( amsb ) with @xmath7 tev@xcite .",
    "anomaly - mediated supersymmetry breaking ( amsb ) models have received much attention in the literature due to their attractive properties@xcite : 1 . the soft supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking terms",
    "are completely calculable in terms of just one free parameter ( the gravitino mass , @xmath8 ) , 2 .",
    "the soft terms are real and flavor invariant , thus solving the susy flavor and @xmath9 problems and 3 .",
    "the soft terms are actually renormalization group invariant@xcite , and can be calculated at any convenient scale choice . in order to realize the amsb set - up , it was proposed that the hidden sector be `` sequestered '' on a separate brane from the observable sector in an extra - dimensional universe , so that tree - level supergravity breaking terms do not dominate the soft term contributions .",
    "such a set - up can be realized in brane - worlds , where susy breaking takes place on one brane , with the visible sector residing on a separate brane .",
    "a further attractive feature of amsb models arises due to the scale of their gravitino mass .",
    "sugra - type models with @xmath5 tev suffer from the cosmological gravitino problem .",

    "amsb models suffer from the well - known problem that slepton mass - squared parameters are found to be negative , giving rise to tachyonic states .",
    "the original `` solution '' to this problem was to posit that scalars acquire as well a universal mass @xmath17 , which when added to the amsb ssb terms , renders them positive@xcite .",
    "the derived form of soft susy breaking terms , supplemented by a universal scalar mass @xmath17 and implemented at the gut scale , constitutes what is usually called the minimal amsb , or mamsb model . in mamsb and the additional models described below",
    ", it is assumed that electroweak symmetry is broken radiatively due to the large top quark mass , so that the magnitude of the @xmath18 parameter is determined to gain the correct value of @xmath19 , and the bilinear soft term @xmath20 is traded for the ratio of higgs field vevs , @xmath21 .",
    "an alternative set - up for amsb has been advocated in ref .",

    "the inoamsb model is suggested by recent work on the phenomenology of flux compactified type iib string theory@xcite , which reduces to @xmath25 supergravity below the compactification scale .",
    "the essential features of this scenario are that the gaugino masses are of the anomaly - mediated susy breaking ( amsb ) form , while scalar and trilinear soft susy breaking terms are highly suppressed : they are taken as @xmath26 at energy scale @xmath27 , at first approximation .",
    "the normally large value of @xmath23 as generated in amsb models feeds into the scalar soft term evolution , lifting slepton soft masses to generate an allowable sparticle mass spectrum , while at the same time avoiding tachyonic sleptons or charged lsps ( lightest susy particles ) .",
    "charged lsps are common in models with negligible soft scalar masses , such as no - scale@xcite or gaugino mediation models@xcite .",
    "since scalar and trilinear soft terms are highly suppressed , the susy induced flavor and @xmath9-violating processes are also suppressed in inoamsb .",

    "we discuss four ways to reconcile the predicted abundance of cdm with experiment :    1 .",
    "enhanced neutralino production via scalar field ( _ e.g. _ moduli ) decay , 2 .",
    "enhanced neutralino production via gravitino decay , where gravitinos may arise thermally , or by moduli or inflaton decay , 3 .",
    "enhanced neutralino production via heavy axino decay , and 4 .",
    "neutralino decay to axinos , where the bulk of cdm comes from a mixture of vacuum mis - alignment produced axions and thermally produced axinos .",
    "cases 1 and 2 should lead to a situation where all of cdm is comprised of wino - like wimps ; they will be very hard , perhaps impossible , to tell apart .",
    "case 3 would contain a mixture of axion and wino - like wimp cdm .",
    "it is a scenario where it is possible that both a wimp and an axion could be detected .",
    "case 4 predicts no direct or indirect detection of wimps , but a possible detection of relic axions .",
    "it is important to note that more than one of these mechanisms may occur at once : for instance , we may gain additional neutralino production in the early universe from moduli , gravitino and axino decay all together .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : winodet ] , we presented rates for direct and indirect detection of relic wino - like wimps .",
    "the si direct detection cross sections are bounded from below .",
    "ultimately , ton - scale noble liquid or supercdms experiments should probe out to @xmath42 gev , which would exceed the 100 fb@xmath159 reach of lhc ; a non - observation of signal would put enormous stress on amsb - like models as new physics .",
    "we also evaluated sd direct detection : current experiments have little reach for amsb - like models , although icecube deepcore and possibly coupp upgrades may probe more deeply .",
    "we also presented indirect wimp detection rates for all three amsb models .",
    "the icecube experiment has some reach for wimps from amsb models , especially at high @xmath21 or when the @xmath30 picks up a higgsino component .",
    "we noted an interesting inverse resonance effect in the muon flux detection rate , caused by transition from solar core annihilations to @xmath209 states , to annihilations to mainly @xmath192 states .",
    "the detection of @xmath44s , @xmath45s , @xmath46s and @xmath47s are all elevated in amsb - like models compared to msugra , due to the high rate for @xmath185 annihilation in the galactic halo .",
    "the results do depend on the assumed halo profile , especially for @xmath44-ray detection in the direction of the galactic core . generally ,",
    "if a signal is seen in the @xmath45 channel , then one ought to be seen in the @xmath46 channel , and ultimately in the @xmath44 , @xmath47 ( if / when gaps flies ) or direct detection channel .",
    "in addition , a sparticle production signal should ultimately be seen at lhc , at least for @xmath218 gev , once 100 fb@xmath159 of integrated luminosity is accrued .    as a final remark ,",
    "we note here that the dark matter detection signals all provide complementary information to that which will be provided by the cern lhc . at lhc , each model mamsb , hcamsb and inoamsb will provide a rich assortment of gluino and squark cascade decay signals which will include multi - jet plus multi - lepton plus missing @xmath219 events . in all cases ,",
    "the wino - like lightest neutralino state will be signaled by the well - known presence of highly ionizing tracks ( hits ) from quasi - stable charginos with track length of order _",
    "cm_s , before they decay to soft pions plus a @xmath30 .",
    "it is noted in ref s @xcite and @xcite that the three models should be distinguishable at lhc by the differing opposite - sign / same flavor dilepton invariant mass distributions . in the case of mamsb , with @xmath220 ,",
    "we expect a single mass edge from @xmath221 decay . in hcamsb ,",
    "the sleptons are rather heavy , and instead @xmath222 occurs at a large rate , leading to a bump in @xmath223 , upon a continuum distribution . in inoamsb , with @xmath224 , but with @xmath225 and @xmath226 split in mass ( due to different @xmath22 quantum numbers ) , a characteristic _",
    "double mass edge _ is expected in the @xmath227 invariant mass distribution .",
