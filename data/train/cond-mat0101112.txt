    "percolation is related to many interesting scientific phenomena @xcite . in recent years",
    "percolation problems with multiple percolating clusters have attracted much attention [ 2 - 19 ] .",
    "most of the simulational studies of such problems have been restricted to percolation on lattices @xcite .",
    "however , many physical systems with multiple percolating clusters such as carbino disks used in the study of quantum hall effects @xcite , or oil fields confronted with drilling problems , do not have underlined regular lattice structures .",
    "thus , it is of interest to know the relationship between the quantities for percolation on regular lattices and the quantities for percolation not on regular lattices , such as random lattices . in the present paper ,",
    "we use monte carlo simulations to study bond percolation on @xmath0 planar random lattices , duals of random lattices , and square lattices with free and periodic boundary conditions in vertical and horizontal directions , respectively , and with various aspect ratio @xmath1 .",
    "we calculate the probability for the appearance of @xmath2 percolating clusters , @xmath11 , the percolating probabilities , @xmath4 , the average fraction of lattice bonds ( sites ) in percolating clusters , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , and the probability distribution function for fraction @xmath8 of lattice bonds ( sites ) , in percolating clusters of subgraphs with @xmath2 percolating clusters , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) . using a small number of nonuniversal metric factors , we find that @xmath11 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) for random lattices , duals of random lattices , and square lattices , have the same universal finite - size scaling functions .",
    "we also find that nonuniversal metric factors are independent of boundary conditions and aspect ratios .",
    "furthermore , this study is related to recent developments in the universality and scaling of critical phenomena .",
    "universality and scaling are two important concepts in modern theory of critical phenomena @xcite , and percolation models are an ideal system for studying critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "thus , universality and scaling have been actively studied in recent decades , especially for percolation models @xcite . in 1992 , langlands et .",
    "@xcite proposed that for bond and site percolation models on square ( sq ) , planar triangular ( pt ) , and honeycomb ( hc ) lattices , the critical existence probability ( also called crossing probability or spanning probability ) is a universal quantity , when aspect ratios of sq , pt , and hc lattices have relative ratios , @xmath12 @xmath13 . from 1995@xmath141996 , hu , lin and chen ( hlc ) @xcite calculated existence probability , @xmath15 , percolation probability , @xmath4 , and probability for the appearance of @xmath2 percolating clusters , @xmath3 of bond and site percolation models , on sq , hc , and pt lattices with aspect ratios , @xmath16 , and showed that all their scaled data fall on the same universal scaling functions , by selecting a very small numbers of nonuniversal metric factors , and maintaining similar nonuniversal metric factors under two boundary conditions , free and periodic boundary conditions . by using renormalization group theory , hovi and aharony in 1996 @xcite also pointed out that scaling functions , for the spanning probability are universal at the fixed point for every system with the same dimensionality , spanning rule , aspect ratio and boundary conditions .",
    "okabe and kikuchi in 1996 @xcite , extended the work of hlc to a two - dimensional ising model on planar regular lattices . in 1997 , hu and wang @xcite found that the lattice percolation and continuum percolation of hard and soft disks , have the same universal scaling functions for @xmath17 . using the connection between an ising model and a bond - correlated percolation model @xcite , tomita , okabe , and hu in 1999 @xcite , calculated the probability for the appearance of @xmath2 percolating clusters , @xmath3 the percolating probabilities , @xmath4 , the average fraction of lattice sites in percolating clusters , @xmath18 and the probability distribution function for the fraction @xmath8 of lattice sites in percolating clusters of subgraphs with @xmath2 percolating clusters , @xmath19 , for bond - correlated percolation model on sq , hc , and pt lattices , with aspect ratios of @xmath16 .",
    "using a small number of nonuniversal metric factors , they found that @xmath11 , @xmath4 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 for sq , hc , and pt lattices have the same universal finite - size scaling functions .",
    "however , the studies mentioned above are mostly focused on regular lattices , with fixed coordination numbers @xcite . in 1999",
    "hsu and huang ( hh ) @xcite determined the percolation thresholds and critical exponents , and demonstrated explicitly that the ideas of universal critical exponents and universal scaling function with nonuniversal metric factors can be extended to bond percolation on @xmath20 periodic planar random lattices , duals of random lattices , and square lattices , for both existence and percolating probabilities , and mean cluster size .",
    "this paper will study bond percolation on @xmath21 planar random lattices , duals of random lattices , and square lattices , in more detail , and consider the case that the lattices have free and periodic boundary conditions , in vertical and horizontal directions , respectively , as in @xcite . percolating probability",
    "is defined by the ratio of the number of bonds in the percolating clusters to the total number of bonds in @xcite . here , we consider two different definitions of the percolating probability , in terms of bonds and in terms of sites ; the latter was also used in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we calculate the probability @xmath11 for the appearance of @xmath2 percolating clusters , the percolating probability @xmath4 , the average fraction of lattice bonds ( sites ) in percolating clusters , @xmath5 @xmath22 , and the probability distribution function for the fraction @xmath8 of lattice bonds ( sites ) in percolating clusters of subgraphs with @xmath2 percolating clusters , @xmath9 @xmath23 , for various values of aspect ratios @xmath24 , and finally check the universal finite - size scaling behaviors for these quantities . in @xcite ,",
    "hh used two nonuniversal metric factors , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , to fix universal finite - size scaling functions , for percolating probability in terms of bonds . in the present paper , we calculated two nonuniversal metric factors of percolating probability , in terms of sites and obtained previous known values of nonuniversal metric factors determined by hh , to check whether we could have universal scaling functions for @xmath11 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 @xmath22 , and @xmath9 @xmath23 , of bond percolation on random lattices , duals of random lattices , and square lattices .",
    "dirichlet and voronoi @xcite first used the concept of random lattices in condensed matter theory and christ , friedberg , and lee ( cfl ) @xcite used another type of random lattices to formulate quantum field theory . here",
    ", we adopt the cfl algorithm and give a brief review of the construction of planar random lattices and their duals .",
    "first , we randomly generate @xmath27 sites in the @xmath21 rectangular domain with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "next , we choose three nearby sites arbitrarily , and draw a circle to go through the three sites .",
    "if there are no lattice sites inside the circle , the three sites are connected by links to form a triangle .",
    "a planar random lattice is constructed by repeating the process until all sites are connected by links .",
    "the whole rectangular domain is divided into @xmath28 non - overlapping triangles , whose vertices are sites of the random lattice , and circle centers with triangles are the sites of dual lattice .",
    "thus , there is a one to one correspondence between triangles and dual lattice sites .",
    "because a link of the random lattice is shared by two triangles , the two corresponding dual lattice sites are connected by one dual link .",
    "there is a one to one correspondence between links and dual links .",
    "the whole rectangular domain is partitioned into @xmath27 non - overlapping planar convex polyhedra , which are formed by dual links and the vertices of @xmath27 polyhedra are sites for dual lattice .",
    "there is also a one to one correspondence between the lattice sites and polyhedra on dual lattice .",
    "examples of a planar random lattice with its dual , under periodic boundary conditions , in both vertical and horizontal directions , are shown in fig .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we present the simulational results for @xmath11 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) for bond percolation , on @xmath21 random lattices , duals of random lattices , and square lattices , under free and periodic boundary conditions in vertical and horizontal directions with @xmath29 .",
    "the boundary bonds which cross the rectangular domain in vertical direction on random lattices , due to periodic boundary conditions , are eliminated because of free boundary conditions in vertical direction considered in this paper .",
    "we adopt the method of hh @xcite , to find percolating clusters",
    ". only the first kind of percolating cluster paths , without boundary bonds in the vertical direction ( the clusters extend from top to bottom ) , should be identified , and an example of this is shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) . in sec .",
    "iii , we use finite - size scaling theory to check the scaling behaviors of various quantities , and to show that such quantities have universal finite - size scaling functions for regular lattices and random lattices . a summary is provided in sec .",
    "we see the bond percolation on a lattice @xmath31 , with linear dimensions @xmath32 and @xmath33 in horizontal and vertical directions , respectively ; the probability for the appearance of @xmath2 top - to - bottom percolating clusters , @xmath34 is defined by @xcite @xmath35 here , the percolating cluster is defined as a cluster extending from top to bottom in @xmath31 , @xmath36 denotes a percolating subgraph with @xmath2 percolating clusters , @xmath37 is the number of occupied bonds in @xmath36 , and @xmath38 is the total number of links in @xmath31 .",
    "the existence probability @xmath15 can be expressed obviously as @xmath39 with @xmath40 .    to obtain more detailed information about the contents of the percolating cluster , following tomita et .",

    "the probability distribution function of @xmath8 in all subgraphs is the overall summations of @xmath43 i.e. , @xmath44 in terms of @xmath19 , the average fraction of lattice bonds ( sites ) in subgraphs with @xmath2 percolating clusters can be expressed as @xmath45 where @xmath46 and percolating probability @xmath4 can be written as @xmath47    to generate subgraphs , we use the random bond occupation process with equal occupation probability for each link .",
    "the simulations are performed on @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 planar random ( pran ) lattices , and their duals ( dpran ) , with free and periodic boundary conditions in the vertical and horizontal directions , respectively . to compare the results with regular lattices , we also perform simulations on square ( sq ) lattices of the same sizes . on each lattice , we take @xmath51 occupation probabilities around the critical percolation threshold for every @xmath52 increment , and use the random bond occupation process to generate @xmath53 configurations for each occupied probability , @xmath54 .",

    "4 . the differences between bond and site contents in percolating clusters are shown in figs . 3 and 4 ; here , for the clarity of presentation",
    "only , the results for @xmath50 lattices are plotted in the figures .",
    "the finite - size scaling theory was first formulated by fisher in 1971 @xcite . according to the theory , for a physical quantity @xmath63 which scales as @xmath64 in a thermodynamic system near critical point @xmath65 , then the same quantity in a finite system with linear dimension @xmath66 , @xmath67 , should obey the general law , @xmath68 here , @xmath69 with @xmath70 labelled as scaling function , with @xmath71 as correlation length exponent . in 1984 ,",
    "privman and fisher @xcite considered universal finite - size scaling functions and nonuniversal metric factors , and proposed that the singular part of the free energy of a critical system can be written as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the spatial dimensionality of lattice , @xmath74 is a universal scaling function , and @xmath75 is a nonuniversal metric factor .    at the critical point ,",
    "@xmath60 , there also exists a finite - size scaling form for the distribution function of @xmath76 @xcite : @xmath77 in @xcite , three nonuniversal metric factors @xmath78 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 were used for regular lattices and random lattices , to describe the universal scaling functions of existence probability @xmath15 , and the percolating probability @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath79 with @xmath80 and @xmath81 with @xmath82    following hu et .",
