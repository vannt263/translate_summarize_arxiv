    "inflation  @xcite is the leading idea providing a satisfactory description of the evolution of the very early universe before the standard hot big bang commences .",
    "some of its predictions , like homogeneity , isotropy and flatness of the observable patch of the universe , have been verified with unprecedented precision , with the most up - to - date observational surveys pointing to a nearly scale - invariant , gaussian distribution of the primordial perturbations  @xcite .",
    "however , the theory into which the inflationary mechanism is embedded is still elusive and there remains a number of questions regarding inflation model building  @xcite .",
    "string theory provides such an ultraviolet ( uv ) complete framework , a general characteristic of which is the presence of a variety of fields and peculiarities which can alter the otherwise smooth dynamics of inflation .    on the observational side ,",
    "the planck mission on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) has provided data of unprecedented precision on the cmb power spectrum  @xcite , which supports most inflationary predictions  @xcite .",
    "there seems however to exist several anomalies in the power spectrum , including deviations from scale invariance indicated by outliers beyond 2@xmath4 significance at several multipole ranges  @xcite .",
    "the appearance of these features has sparked intensive efforts to study such a possible scale dependence  @xcite which is indeed predicted by such embeddings of inflation in uv complete frameworks .",
    "observable features of the power spectrum can be produced in various ways : these include for example heavy degrees of freedom , resulting in a non - trivial speed of sound  @xcite , and features in the inflaton potential  @xcite , resulting in sudden variations of the slow - roll parameters .",
    "these mechanisms provide deviations from the standard single - field canonical slow - roll inflation .",
    "furthermore , it is expected that such a behaviour will also affect the bispectrum ( as well as all the higher - order spectra ) , whose shape as a function of the three momenta depends strongly on the class of models under consideration .",
    "for example , non -",
    "canonical inflation leads to equilateral or orthogonal non - gaussianity and multi - field inflation leads to a local shape  @xcite .",
    "this implies that joint analysis of the power spectrum and bispectrum would lead to stronger constraints  @xcite .",
    "indeed , a possible detection of features in the bispectrum would give us deeper insights into the details of inflation , since on one hand it would increase the statistical significance of these anomalies while on the other hand it would shed light on the mechanism responsible for them .",
    "however , observational data on the primordial bispectrum are still quite poor , a fact that highly limits the ability of observational surveys to guide theoretical searches towards the correct answer .",
    "hence , what can be done at this stage is to construct theoretically motivated bispectrum templates , which can then be searched for in the data , and consistency relations or tests of certain assumptions which can be used in sparse data sets .    in this article",
    ", we construct such consistency relations for the primordial bispectrum in the general case where sudden deviations from slow - roll occur in the potential and/or the kinetic parameters , like the hubble parameter or the speed of sound of the curvature perturbation . therefore ,",
    "if features exist in the correlation functions then we can predict patterns that the bispectrum should follow . furthermore , motivated from our relations , we show that it is possible for the orthogonal and local templates to appear with an oscillatory profile , typical of inflationary features , complementing the current use of templates modulated by equilateral and flattened shapes  @xcite . furthermore , our analysis is also suitable for the case of multi - frequency oscillating patterns in the three - point function  @xcite .    specifically",
    ", we derive a set of shape consistency relations , and in the sense that measurements of the bispectrum at any three sets of modes with momenta @xmath5 for @xmath6 should be related .",
    "we expect that such consistency tests will be of use in prospect of the large - scale structure surveys , which are expected to provide information on the bispectrum at multiple @xmath7-modes , greatly improving the constraints on features  @xcite . then , based on the qualitative form of these consistency relations , we also propose two bispectrum templates for features that can include all the known modulating shapes such as the equilateral , flattened , orthogonal and local ones .",
    "the article is organised as follows : in section  [ sec : bispectrum ] we present the general form of the bispectrum in the presence of deviations from usual slow - roll evolution during inflation . in section",
    "[ sec : shapeconsistency ] we derive the bispectrum consistency relations , while in section  [ sec : template ] we study the component shapes that are involved in the consistency relations and compare them with the already used templates .",
    "finally , we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the cubic action for the curvature perturbation can be , after integration by parts , written as  @xcite @xmath8 \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] up to boundary terms . here",
    "@xmath9 is determined by the constraint @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is a model - dependent parameter  @xcite and the last term multiplied by the linear equation of motion @xmath15 can be removed by a field redefinition  @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the case in which the background parameters experience temporary deviations from slow - roll .",
    "note that in order for such an effect to be observable in the cmb which covers a few @xmath16-folds during inflation , any variation should indeed happen in a few @xmath16-folds , or in other words any feature producing observable effects should be sharp . to quantify this , we allow any background parameter like @xmath17 satisfy @xmath18 which can be more conveniently written in terms of the conformal time @xmath19 as @xmath20 such a condition drastically simplifies the form of the full cubic action to  @xcite @xmath21 \\ , , \\ ] ] which is the form that we will use .",
    "the coefficients @xmath22 contain the variations of @xmath23 and @xmath24  @xcite . thus given that their amplitudes are constrained to remain small from various observations",
    ", their rapid variations can give rise to sharp features .",
    "note that in  @xcite , a reasonable but ad - hoc relation between @xmath25 and @xmath26 was imposed , so that the two dimensionless coefficients @xmath27 and @xmath28 in , which are in principle independent parameters in the effective field theory point of view  @xcite , were related by a single parameter .",
    "here we do not use any such relation and we keep @xmath22 free .    with the leading de sitter mode function solution for @xmath29 with @xmath30 , @xmath31 we can follow the standard in - in formalism to compute the bispectrum as @xmath32   ie^{ik\\tau } \\right .",

    "this is because the sub - leading @xmath68 and @xmath69 terms in are boosted by @xmath70 and become the leading contributions to the bispectrum .",

    "however , our net result is of similar spirit as that of  @xcite , in saying that the lower value of primordial non - gaussianity is controlled by the spectral index .",
    "the shape consistency relations and are the main results of this section : since these relations are derived based on the assumption of sharp features , which in general favours higher derivative terms compared to lower ones , they represent tests of such an assumption , i.e. they provide a consistency check of sharp features in the bispectrum .",
    "this implies that if rapid time variations of the background quantities , such as the speed of sound or the slow - roll parameters , did indeed take place during inflation and features are generated , then the corresponding bispectrum evaluated for any three triplets of modes should obey and .      ) and ( right panel ) folded ( @xmath93 ) shape functions for the starobinsky model , constructed in terms of two configurations @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",

    ", our shape consistency relation agrees nicely with the full analytic result .    . ]",
    "in this section , motivated by the form of the shape consistency relations , we propose two generic 2-parameter templates that could capture the featured bispectrum stemming from the time variation of both the speed of sound @xmath24 and the slow - roll parameter @xmath23 . by thinking of @xmath111 in and as trigonometric functions , typical of inflationary models yielding oscillatory spectra  @xcite , we may consider and as an expansion of the bispectrum shape in a basis and focus on the component shapes .",
    "in addition , by adopting such a view and identifying @xmath112 , it is clear that there could be more than one frequency at play in the oscillating @xmath113 functions .",
    "such a multi - frequency distribution of features is supported by the current planck data  @xcite .",
    "hence , we suggest the following two modulating templates : @xmath114 + \\gamma_2 \\left [ s_2(x , y )   + \\frac{f_2(x , y)}{2xy } \\right ] \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the @xmath73 and @xmath72 functions defined in and the numerical coefficients @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 in and . note that although there are more than one shape functions involved in and , they are quite degenerate leading to similar results for a wide range of parameters @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 .    depending on the triangle configurations chosen as a basis , the coefficients @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 , @xmath118 take specific values . in order to demonstrate the generality of the proposed modulating template , we choose two representative sets of two triangles : @xmath119 where , as in the previous section , we have specified the triangles by their lengths @xmath120 , with the remaining side being fixed to 1 .",
    "these lead to the following doublets @xmath121 or @xmath122 : @xmath123 for the template it is sufficient to consider the triangle @xmath124 , leading to @xmath125 since the other choices lead to similar shapes . plugging these values in and",
    ", we obtain the following shapes : @xmath126 which are plotted in figure  [ fig : shapes ] .",
    "note that these specific choices of triangles do not mean loss of generality .",
    "there should be an infinite number of triangles which lead to degenerate results .",
    "here we only intend to demonstrate the realisation of the standard templates with specific examples .     and @xmath127 for the representative sets of triangles given in the main text .",
    "the zero plane is also plotted .",
    "note that the intersection with the zero plane is critical in deciding if their overlap is larger with the equilateral , orthogonal or flat templates : see table  [ table : cos ] . ]    in order to quantitatively compare these shapes with the equilateral  @xcite , enfolded  @xcite , orthogonal  @xcite and local templates  @xcite , which are given respectively by @xmath128 we employ the cosine estimator  @xcite .",
    "we define the weighted inner product of two shapes @xmath129 and @xmath130 as @xmath131 with the integration region running over @xmath132 and @xmath133 , and from this we define the cosine between these shapes as @xmath134 the cosines between the standard templates and the shapes are presented in table  [ table : cos ] , where we can see that these templates do indeed overlap with the standard ones .",
    "we find that the orthogonal template , predicted by the effective field theory of inflation appears as a possible candidate modulating the oscillatory bispectrum .",
    "for example , while the shape @xmath135 can be efficiently probed by the enfolded template , the shape @xmath136 is closer to the orthogonal one and @xmath137 has a clear local form .",

    "note that these templates are suggested along the lines of those used by planck in search for features modulated by equilateral and flattened shapes .",
    "we may well add for example a damping envelope such as @xmath142 , in order to capture the fact that features are localised in @xmath7-space .",
    "a variety of models inspired by uv complete theories can predict deviations from standard slow - roll inflation , leading to an oscillatory behaviour of the cmb spectrum , a signature which is marginally supported by the current observational data .    exploiting the quasi de sitter phase during inflation and the fact that any observable scale dependence in the data should stem from a sharp feature in the background parameters , we have derived a model - independent set of shape consistency relations for such inflationary features in the bispectrum . specifically , we have shown that if temporary deviations from standard slow - roll did happen during inflation , then measurements of the bispectrum for any three triplets of modes with momenta @xmath143 for @xmath6 should be related via and .",
    "motivated by the form of the consistency relations , we have also produced generic two - parameter templates that include the equilateral , flattened , orthogonal and local ones , albeit with non - zero overlap .",
    "this specifically implies that the orthogonal and local templates can also appear as modulating shapes of the oscillatory bispectrum resulting from this class of models and a search for these profiles could improve constraints on features .",
    "the form of the consistency relations also allows for templates with more than one frequency at play in the oscillatory functions in accordance to the multi - frequency distribution suggested by planck .",
    "an interesting generalisation of our result in this direction is to keep all terms in the lagrangian and also all time derivatives of the coefficients @xmath22 , which represent collectively background inflationary parameters .",
    "although the result is quite complicated to be used in the form of a consistency relation , it is exactly this complexity that gives us freedom to produce several possibly new bispectrum templates .",
    "finally , let us stress that our method could be used even in the case that features are not confirmed in order to produce possible new shapes of non - gaussianity .",

    "<S> we offer a new approach to analyse the appearance of features in the primordial bispectrum that justifies the search of oscillating patterns modulated by orthogonal and local templates in the cosmic microwave background data . by studying the dynamics of the primordial curvature perturbation during inflation , we find that the couplings parametrising cubic self - interactions , responsible for features , </S>",
    "<S> can be expressed as functions of the bispectrum along specific directions in momentum space . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , we find a general expression describing departures from scale invariance in the bispectrum telling us how these appear modulated by different classes of shapes . </S>",
    "<S> on one hand , this result allows us to relate features appearing in different shapes in a unique way , such that if they are observed in a particular shape , they have to spread to others obeying certain rules . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , it serves as a tool to produce new templates of features in the bispectrum modulated by shapes that so far have not been considered to analyse data .    </S>",
