    "the helicity amplitudes that describe the decays to nucleons are extracted experimentally by considering instead the time - reversed process , pion photoproduction .",
    "information is available for the decays to nucleons simply because the fixed targets used in experiment are made of nucleons , not deltas . to study the decays of excited baryons ( in our case @xmath9 s or @xmath10 s ) to @xmath5 not only requires that we produce enough excited states to make up for the small electromagnetic branching fractions , but also that we reconstruct a sufficient fraction of the events given the final three decay products . the 1998 review of particle physics @xcite lists no data for the @xmath5 partial decay widths , nor for the more challenging helicity amplitudes , which require data on the angular distributions of the decays .",
