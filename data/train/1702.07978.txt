    "* extremely small tidal disruption radius for strange planets .",
    "* strange planets can be used to test the sqm hypothesis .",
    "the basic idea relies on the gigantic difference between the tidal disruption radius for an sqm planet and that for a normal matter one .",
    "it is well known that tidal force from the host star tends to tear a planet apart , but it can be resisted by the self - gravity of the planet when the two objects is far away . there exists a critical distance , i.e. the so called tidal disruption radius , at which the tidal force is exactly balanced by the self - gravity of the planet@xcite , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the mass of the central compact object and @xmath19 is the density of the planet . if the orbit radius is smaller than @xmath20 , the tidal force will dominate and the planet will be broken up . note that in this study , the effect of the stress inside the planet can be safely omitted ( see methods ) . from equation",
    "( 1 ) , we see that typically a normal matter planet will be disrupted at a distance of @xmath21 cm .",
    "it means we will in no ways be able to see a normal planet orbiting around its host at a distance much less than this value .",
    "for example , even when we take the planet density as high as 200 g/@xmath22 , the tidal disruption radius will still be as large as @xmath23 cm .",
    "on the contrary , sqm planets are extremely compact and their densities are typically @xmath24 g/@xmath22",
    ". the corresponding tidal disruption radius will be @xmath25 cm .",
    "thus a strange planet will retain its integrity even when it almost comes to the surface of the central host strange star .",
    "these analyses remind us that we could test the sqm hypothesis through exoplanet observations .     to calculate the tidal disruption radius .",
    "note that the 4 star symbols stand for pulsar planets . * * * ]    * examining the observed exoplanets . * exoplanets can be detected in various ways@xcite .",
    "currently the most productive method is through transit photometry , i.e. monitoring the periodic brightness variation of the host star induced by the transit of a planet across the stellar disk . in this aspect , the _ kepler _ mission is undoubtedly the most successful project@xcite .",
    "_ kepler _ is a space - based optical telescope of 0.95  m aperture .",
    "it was launched in 2009 by nasa to monitor @xmath26 stars over a period of four years . with a 105 square degree field - of - view and @xmath5 ppm photometry accuracy ,",
    "it successfully detected over 4600 planetary candidates and confirmed over a thousand exoplanets .",
    "an important advantage of the transit photometry method is that it is even possible to measure the size of the planet , so that its density can be derived@xcite . in some special cases ,",
    "even the planet atmosphere can be probed@xcite .",
    "another widely used method is through radial velocity measurement , which inspects the regular radial velocity variations of the host star caused by the orbital movement of the planet .",
    "long - term accuracies of the host s radial motions of several meters per second are needed , which can effectively yield all orbital elements of the planets except the orbital inclination .",
    "thirdly , for pulsar planets , timing observation is an effective method since the orbital motion of planets will affect the arrival times of the pulsar s radio pulses .",
    "in fact , the first extrasolar planet was detected orbiting around psr b1257 + 12 just through this method@xcite .",
    "finally , several other not - so - commonly - used methods , such as astrometry , gravitational microlensing , and direct imaging , have also been successfully applied and led to the detection of a small portion of the currently known exoplanets .    due to continuous improvements in the above observational techniques ,",
    "the number of observed exoplanets is expanding quickly in recent years@xcite . according to the exoplanet data explorer website (",
    "address : exoplanets.org , queried by 2016 december 26 ) , about 2950 exoplanets have been confirmed ( see methods ) .",
    "with so many exoplanets at hand , we can try to search for possible sqm objects in them . for the planets with densities available ( 2430 objects ) , we have calculated their tidal disruption radii ( @xmath20 ) and compare them with the corresponding orbital radius ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "1a illustrates the mass distribution vs. the closeness of these planets , i.e. @xmath28 .",
    "it can be clearly seen that all the planets lie outside of the tidal disruption region , which proves @xmath29 as a definite limitation for the survival of planets . for the remaining 520 exoplanets without a density measurement ,",
    "we have assumed a typical value of 8 g/@xmath30 for them and also plotted their distributions in fig .",
    "again we see that no planets lie in the tidal disruption region .    from fig .  1",
    ", we see that no clues pointing toward the existence of any sqm objects can be found from the current exoplanet samples .",
    "this is not an unexpected result .",
    "sqm planets , if really exist , are not likely found to be orbiting around normal main sequence stars , but should be around compact stars ( especially , strange stars ) .",
    "thus we should pay special attention to exoplanets of pulsars .",
    "in fact , we already have several planets detected orbiting around two pulsars , i.e. psr b1257 + 12 and psr b1620 - 26 . in fig .",
    "1b , these planets are marked by star symbols .",
    "still , we see that these planets are not close - in enough to be identified as sqm planets .",
    "searching for close - in exoplanets around pulsars should be the main direction of our future efforts . due to their extreme closeness",
    ", these planets will only exert a very small radial velocity perturbation on the central host compact star , which will be difficult to be grasped by pulsar timing observations .",
    "below , we give an estimate on the lower mass limit of the planets that could be detected with current observational techniques .",
    "let us consider a planet of mass @xmath31 orbiting around a pulsar ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "in half of the orbital period , the pulsar will have a positive radial velocity perturbation with respect to us , owing to the existence of the small companion , while in the other half orbit , it has a negative velocity perturbation . as a result , the topocentric time - of - arrival ( toa ) of its clock - like pulses will systematically deviate from normal rhythm regularly",
    ". the accumulated toa deviation can be as large as several milliseconds in each of the half orbit and can be potentially detected through long - term timing observations .",
    "in fact , assuming a circular orbit , the planet mass is connected with the semi - amplitude @xmath32 of the corresponding toa variations as ( see methods)@xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the planet s orbital period , @xmath35 is the orbital inclination , and @xmath36 g is the earth mass .",
    "the pulsar timing method essentially is also trying to measure the radial velocity perturbation . by accumulating the toa residuals induced by the radial velocity variation in half of the orbit and through microsecond precision of timing observations , it can equivalently measure the radial velocity perturbation at an unprecedented accuracy of @xmath37 cm / s .",
    "as a contrast , traditional radial velocity measurement through optical spectroscopy can only achieve an accuracy of @xmath37 m / s currently .",
    "timing observation is thus an ideal method that could be effectively used to search for possible close - in strange planets around pulsars .    in view of the radial velocity variation ( @xmath38 ) of the host pulsar , equation ( 2 )",
    "can be conveniently expressed as ( see methods ) @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the density of normal matter planets is typically in the range of 0.1  10 g/@xmath22 .",
    "only very few planets have densities exceeding 80 g/@xmath22 ( supplementary fig .  2 ) .",
    "here we can set a secure upper limit of 100  g/@xmath22 for typical normal planets .",
    "it corresponds to a tidal disruption radius of @xmath41  cm according to equation ( 1 ) .",
    "we thus need to search for strange planets with orbital radii smaller than this value .",
    "in fact , all the currently detected exoplanets lie far beyond this region ( supplementary fig .  3 ) .",
    "from equation ( 3 ) , we see that at the limiting radius ( @xmath42 cm ) , all planets more massive than @xmath43 can be detected by current pulsar timing observations . for more close - in strange planets ,",
    "even less massive sqm planets can also be detected .",
    "taking typical values of @xmath44 , @xmath45 cm / s , and @xmath46 m@xmath47 , we have plot the limiting mass of planets that could be detected in fig .  2 .",
    "the figure gives us the encouraging information that close - in strange planets need not to be very massive to be detected with our current observational techniques .",
    "lying in the tidal disruption region for normal matter , these strange planets will also have very small orbital periods . according to the kepler s law , the radius and period of the orbit",
    "are related by @xmath48 at the limiting radius of @xmath41 cm , the period is @xmath49  s. for more close - in orbits , the periods will be even smaller . in fig .  3 ,",
    "the relation between @xmath34 and @xmath27 is plotted for these close - in orbits . from this figure",
    ", we see that in addition to the criterion of @xmath50 cm , the small orbit period of @xmath51  s is another specific feature for sqm planets .     and",
    "the pulsar mass is taken as 1.4 @xmath52 in this plot . *",
    "* ]     ( the solid line ) , 1.4  @xmath52 ( the dashed line ) , and 2.0  @xmath52 ( the dash - dotted line ) , respectively . for the limiting orbit radius of @xmath53  cm , the corresponding orbit period is @xmath2  s in the 1.4  @xmath52 pulsar case ( see the vertical and horizontal dotted lines ) . * ]",
    "to conclude , we here propose a unique method to test the sqm hypothesis : searching for close - in exoplanets with very small orbital radius ( @xmath50 cm ) and very small orbital period ( @xmath51  s ) .",
    "it is based on the fact that sqm planets are extremely compact and can survive even when they are in the tidal disruption region for normal hadronic planets .",
    "we have examined all the exoplanets detected so far and found no clues pointing toward the existence of sqm objects .",
    "we stress that in the future , such efforts should be made mainly on exoplanets around pulsars . with an unprecedented equivalent radial velocity accuracy of @xmath37 cm / s",
    ", the pulsar timing method could reveal close - in planets as small as @xmath54 .",
    "we appeal to radio astronomers to pay more attention on searching for such close - in exoplanets in the future .",
    "if found , it will lead to a final solution for the long - lasting and highly disputed fundamental problem .",
    "* discriminating strange stars and neutron stars . * how to discriminate strange stars and neutron stars observationally is an important but extremely difficult problem@xcite .",
    "a few possible methods have previously been suggested in the literature , but they are either inconclusive or impractical currently . here",
    "we describe the situation briefly .",
    "firstly , people noticed that the mass - radius relations are different for these two kinds of stars . according to the simplest mit bag model@xcite ,",
    "it is @xmath55 for strange stars , but it is @xmath56 for neutron stars@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this method is severely limited by the fact that the masses and radii of these compact stars can not be measured accurately enough so far .",
    "the fact that strange stars and neutron stars have almost similar radius at the typical pulsar mass of @xmath57@xcite further adds difficulties to the application@xcite .",
    "secondly , it was argued that strange stars can spin at extremely short period ( less than @xmath12 1  ms ) , more approaching the kepler limit as compared with neutron stars@xcite , due to the large shear and bulk viscosity of sqm@xcite . on the other hand , the minimum spin period ( @xmath13 ) of normal neutron stars can hardly reach the submillisecond range@xcite .",
    "it is thus suggested that @xmath58  ms can be used as a criteria for identifying strange stars@xcite .",
    "however , not all strange stars should necessarily spin at such an extreme speed .",
    "further more , the lifetime for a strange star to maintain a submillisecond spin period should be very short even if it has an initial period of @xmath58  ms at birth , due to very strong electromagnetic emission of the fast spinning dipolar magnetic field . on the technological aspect",
    ", it is also difficult to detect submillisecond pulsars observationally ( supplementary fig .  1 ) .",
    "all these factors make the second method still not practical currently .",
    "thirdly , sqm is believed to be characterized by a relatively high cooling rate , due to various neutrino - emitting weak processes such as @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 . as a result , comparing with neutron stars of similar ages , the surface temperatures of strange stars might be slightly lower@xcite . but this method is also troubled by serious theoretical uncertainties , since the cooling rate of neutron stars could also be very high after considering more details@xcite .",
    "fourthly , as fast rotating compact objects , strange stars are expected to emit gravitational waves due to normal mode or @xmath63-mode oscillations@xcite or global solid deformation@xcite .",
    "researchers further noted that gravitational wave signals of binary strange star mergers will be different from that of double neutron stars@xcite .",
    "but in all these cases , the gravitational wave emission is either not strong enough to be detected currently or the difference between strange stars and neutron stars is subtle and inconclusive .    finally , it is interesting to note that strange planets can spiral very close to their host strange stars without being tidally disrupted thanks to their extreme compactness@xcite .",
    "geng et al .",
    "thus suggested that these merger systems would serve as new sources of gravitational wave bursts and could be used as an effective probe for sqm .",
    "this is a very hopeful new method .",
    "the only problem is that it would take an extremely long time for a strange planet to have a chance to merge with its host . according to geng et",
    "al.s estimation , the event rate detected by even the next generation gravitational wave experiment such as the einstein telescope would not exceed a few per year@xcite .",
    "thus the goal is still far from being reachable in the near future .    in our current study",
    ", we suggest that we could probe the existence of sqm by searching for close - in planets among extrasolar planetary systems .",
    "this method can significantly increase the opportunity for success if the sqm hypothesis is correct .    * tidal disruption radius .",
    "* when a planet orbits around its host star , different gravitational force ( from the host star ) will be imposed on different parts of the planet due to their slight difference in distance with respect to the host .",
    "this is the so called tidal effect .",
    "the tidal force tends to tear the planet apart , but it can be resisted by the self - gravity of the planet when the two objects is still farther away . when the two objects approach each other , the tidal effect will become stronger@xcite . if the distance is smaller than the tidal disruption radius ( @xmath20 ) , the planet will be completely broken up .",
    "note that when a solid asteroid ( of mass @xmath31 , radius @xmath63 and density @xmath19 ) gets elongated in the radial direction in the centripetal gravitational field of its host ( mass @xmath18 ) , the elongation stress inside the object can also help to resist the tidal force .",
    "this effect will help to reduce the tidal disruption radius . to consider this effect",
    ", we can approximate the elongated asteroid by a right circular cylinder of length @xmath64 .",
    "the elongation stress will be maximal at the asteroid center , which is@xcite , @xmath65 where @xmath40 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath66 is the distance between the asteroid and the host star . assuming that the strength of the material is @xmath9 and let @xmath67 equal @xmath9",
    ", we can derive the tidal disruption radius as@xcite @xmath68 where @xmath69  g and @xmath70  dyn/@xmath71 .",
    "this equation is applicable if the elongation stress dominates over the self - gravity .",
    "however , for an fe - ni planet of the earth mass of @xmath36 g , density @xmath72 , radius @xmath73 cm , and strength @xmath74 dyn/@xmath71 , we find @xmath75  cm for @xmath76 from the above equation .",
    "it is significantly larger than that derived from equation  ( 1 ) .",
    "if the density of the planets is higher ( which is of more interest in our study ) , the tidal disruption radius will be even larger .",
    "thus for relatively larger planets studied here , this effect is not significant .    * mass constraint from toa variations .",
    "* when a planet of mass @xmath31 orbiting around a pulsar ( @xmath18 ) , the two objects are actually move around their common mass center .",
    "for simplicity , we here assume that the orbital plane is edge on and the orbits are circular . designating the radii of the pulsar orbit and the planet orbit as @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively , then we have @xmath79 .    in half of the orbital period ,",
    "the pulsar will have a positive radial velocity perturbation with respect to us , while in the other half orbit , it has a negative velocity perturbation .",
    "consequently , the observed time - of - arrival ( toa ) of the radio pulses will deviate from normal rhythm .",
    "in each half of the orbit , the accumulated toa deviation is just the light traveling time across the pulsar orbit , i.e. , @xmath80 according to the kepler s law , we further have @xmath81 substitute this equation into equation  ( [ deltat ] ) and make necessary simplifications , we can easily get , @xmath82 which is just equation  ( 2 ) .",
    "on the other hand , considering that the orbital velocity of the pulsar is @xmath38 , we have , @xmath83 substituting @xmath84 into the above equation , we get , @xmath85 this is essentially equation  ( [ mv ] )",
    ".    * pulsar dataset .",
    "* in the literature , it has previously been suggested that the submillisecond pulsar spin period can be regarded as a criteria for identifying strange stars . despite theoretical uncertainties on this criteria , detecting submillisecond pulsars itself",

    "<S> although a search in the @xmath0 exoplanets detected so far has failed to identify any close - in samples that meet the sqm criteria , i.e. lying in the tidal disruption region for normal matter planets , we suggest that such an effort deserves to be continued in the future since it provides a unique test for the sqm hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> especially , we should keep our eyes on possible pulsar planets with orbital radius less than @xmath1  cm and period less than @xmath2  s.    department of astronomy , school of astronomy and space science , nanjing university , nanjing 210023 , china    key laboratory of modern astronomy and astrophysics ( nanjing university ) , ministry of education , nanjing 210023 , china + @xmath3correspondence and requests for materials should be addressed to y.f.h . </S>",
    "<S> ( email : hyf@nju.edu.cn ) .    received    ; accepted * * * * * * * * * ; published * * * * * * * * *    normal matter is constituted of electrons and nucleons . while there is still no evidence showing that electrons can be further divided , each nucleon is found to be composed of three up and down quarks . </S>",
    "<S> pulsars are generally believed to be neutron stars , which are mainly made up of neutrons that agglomerate together to form a highly condensed state . with a typical mass of @xmath4 and a radius of only @xmath5 km , </S>",
    "<S> the density of neutron stars can reach several times that of nuclear saturation density at the center . however , the physics of matter at these extremely high densities is still quite unclear to us@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , hyperons , and baryon resonances ( @xmath6 ) , and even boson condensates ( @xmath7 ) may appear ; quark ( @xmath8 ) deconfinement may also happen . </S>",
    "<S> especially , it has long been suggested that even more exotic state such as the strange quark matter ( sqm ) may exist inside@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> strange quark matter is constituted of almost equal numbers of @xmath8 and @xmath9 quarks , with the @xmath9 quark number slightly smaller due to its relatively higher static mass . </S>",
    "<S> it has been conjectured that sqm may be the true ground state of hadronic matter@xcite , since its energy per baryon could be less than that of the most stable atomic nucleus such as @xmath10fe and @xmath11ni .    the existence of strange quark stars ( also known as `` strange stars '' ) was consequently predicted based on the sqm hypothesis@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> strange stars could simply be bare sqm objects , or bulk sqm cores enveloped by thin nuclear crusts@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the possible existence of nuclear crusts makes strange stars very much similar to normal neutron stars for a distant observer@xcite , which means it is very difficult for us to distinguish these two kinds of intrinsically distinct stars . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting suggestion is that strange stars can spin at extremely short period ( less than @xmath12 1  ms)@xcite due to the large shear and bulk viscosity of sqm@xcite , while the minimum spin period ( @xmath13 ) of normal neutron stars can hardly reach the submillisecond range@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , on the technological aspect , it is difficult to detect submillisecond pulsars observationally . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , according to the atnf pulsar catalogue ( web site : www.atnf.csiro.au/people/pulsar/psrcat ) , the record for the smallest spin period of pulsars is still @xmath14 ms and only about 80 pulsars have periods less than 3 ms among all the @xmath15 pulsars observed so far ( see methods and supplementary fig .  1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> several other methods have also been suggested , based on the mass - radius relation@xcite , cooling behavior@xcite , gravitational wave emission@xcite , etc . </S>",
    "<S> but either the difference between strange stars and neutron stars is subtle and inconclusive , or the practice is extremely difficult currently ( see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> so , after more than 40 years of extensive investigations , we still do not have a satisfactory method to discriminate them@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that small chunks of sqm with baryon number lower than @xmath16 can stably exist according to the sqm hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , there is effectively no limitation on the minimum mass of strange stars . </S>",
    "<S> it means the sqm version of white dwarfs , i.e. strange dwarfs , can exist , and even strange planets may present in the universe@xcite . in this study , we suggest that we would be able to identify strange planets among exoplanets since they could be very nearby to their hosts . </S>"
