    "homotopy quantum field theories were invented by turaev @xcite , though the idea goes back to segal s discussion of the possible geometry underlying elliptic cohomology @xcite .",
    "segal s construction is a generalisation of his definition of conformal field theory to the situation where one has a target or background space @xmath0 .",
    "he assigns a topological vector space @xmath1 to each collection of loops @xmath2 in a space @xmath0 and a trace - class map @xmath3 to each riemann surface @xmath4 equipped with a map @xmath5 agreeing with @xmath6 on the boundary .",
    "the assignment is multiplicative in the sense that @xmath7 is isomorphic to @xmath8 .",
    "the result can be thought of as a kind of infinite dimensional bundle on the free loop space of @xmath0 , together with a generalised connection which describes `` parallel transport '' along surfaces .",
    "one can package this in terms of representations of a category @xmath9 whose objects are pairs @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a compact , closed , oriented 1-manifold and @xmath12 is a continuous function ; and whose morphisms are equivalence classes of triples @xmath13 , where @xmath4 is a riemann surface , @xmath14 a boundary identification @xmath15 and @xmath5 is a continuous function equal to @xmath2 and @xmath16 on the boundary .",
    "segal defines an elliptic object to be a multiplicative functor from this category to the category of topological vector spaces satisfying a number of further conditions . for @xmath0",
    "a point one regains the category at the heart of segal s axiomatic definition of conformal field theory . from one point of view the above is a way of organising the surfaces and maps to an auxiliary space @xmath0 which occur in non - linear @xmath17-models in string theory , but stopping short of integrating over mapping spaces .",
    "a 1 + 1-dimensional _ homotopy quantum field theory _ is a variant of the above , in which the complex structure is neglected , topological vector spaces are replaced with finite dimensional complex vector spaces and linear maps associated to cobordisms are invariant under deformation by homotopy ( relative to the boundary ) .",
    "these can be thought of geometrically as flat `` higher '' bundles with base the free loop space . in general",
    "an @xmath18-dimensional homotopy quantum field theory is an @xmath18-dimensional topological quantum field theory `` with background '' .",
    "of particular interest is when the background space is a classifying space of some kind and so maps to it have a geometrical meaning , for example @xmath19 in which case maps to @xmath0 are interpreted as @xmath20-bundles . for @xmath20 a finite group this makes contact with dijkgraaf - witten theory .    for a path connected",
    "pointed space @xmath0 , define an @xmath0-manifold to be a closed oriented @xmath21-manifold @xmath22 with pointed components , equipped with a based map @xmath23 .",
    "define an @xmath0-homeomorphism of @xmath0-manifolds to be an orientation preserving homeomorphism @xmath24 sending basepoints to basepoints such that @xmath25 .",
    "an @xmath0-cobordism is an oriented @xmath18-manifold whose boundary is an @xmath0-manifold ( where the orientation of the ingoing boundary components is opposite to the induced one ) together with a map to @xmath0 ( taking boundary basepoints to the basepoint in @xmath0 ) .",
    "where boundaries agree , @xmath0-cobordisms can be glued using @xmath0-homeomorphisms .",
    "let @xmath26 denote the result of gluing @xmath27 to @xmath28 using the @xmath0-homeomorphism @xmath29 where the outgoing boundary of @xmath27 is glued to the ingoing boundary of @xmath28 .",
    "turaev then defines an @xmath18-dimensional homotopy quantum field theory ( over @xmath30 ) with target @xmath0 as an assignment of a finite dimensional vector space @xmath31 to each @xmath0-manifold @xmath22 , of an isomorphism @xmath32 to each @xmath0-homeomorphism @xmath33 , and of a linear map @xmath34 to each @xmath0-cobordism @xmath35 from @xmath36 to @xmath37 , satisfying the following axioms , where the numbering is turaev s .",
    "* each isomorphism @xmath38 is invariant under isotopies of @xmath0-homeomorphisms and @xmath39 * for two @xmath0-manifolds @xmath22 and @xmath40 there is a symmetric natural isomorphism @xmath41 * there is an isomorphism @xmath42 * the maps @xmath43 are natural with respect to @xmath0-homeomorphisms * for two @xmath0-cobordisms @xmath28 and @xmath44 , @xmath45 * @xmath46 * for any @xmath0-manifold @xmath23 , the @xmath0-cobordism @xmath47{\\rightarrow}x$ ] given by @xmath48 is assigned the identity map @xmath49 . * for any @xmath0-cobordism @xmath35 , @xmath50 is invariant under homotopies relative to @xmath51 .    in the above",
    "there is one important difference from turaev s definition as stated in @xcite , namely part of his axiom ( 1.2.7 ) has been omitted . in his manuscript",
    "he demands @xmath52{\\rightarrow}x ) = id$ ] for _ any _ @xmath0-cobordism of the form @xmath53{\\rightarrow}x$ ] which by force makes homotopy information in dimensions greater than @xmath21 redundant . by omitting this ( and thus giving a role to higher homotopy )",
    "turaev s results in @xcite must be restated as applying to @xmath0 an eilenberg - maclane space only .",
    "this is the position adopted by rodrigues in @xcite , where a careful discussion of the axioms can be found .",
    "notice that for a contractible target space the above reduces to a topological quantum field theory as for each manifold or cobordism there is a unique up to homotopy map to @xmath0 .",
    "notice too that the definition provides numerical invariants of closed @xmath0-cobordisms by methods standard in tqft : regard a closed manifold as a cobordism from the empty manifold to itself which gives a linear map @xmath54 whose value on 1 is the desired invariant . by methods standard in tqft",
    "it can also be seen that @xmath55 . also , associated to each point @xmath56 in @xmath0 there is an induced tqft defined by those maps collapsing all manifolds and cobordisms to @xmath56 .",
    "concurrent with turaev s definition , the first two authors defined a categorical version of the above in dimension @xmath57 . letting @xmath58 denote @xmath21 copies of a standard circle define the _ homotopy surface category @xmath59 of a space @xmath0 _ to be the category with the following objects and morphisms .",
    "* objects are pairs @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 is a continuous function .",

    "@xmath5 is a continuous function such that @xmath66 . + a morphism @xmath67",
    "is identified with @xmath68 if there exists a diffeomorphism @xmath69 such that @xmath70 and the diagram @xmath71^{t } \\ar[dr]_{g_1 } & & \\sigma_2    \\ar[dl]^{g_2}\\\\ & x}\\ ] ] commutes up to homotopy relative to the boundary of @xmath72 .",
    "this is a monoidal category under disjoint union and an equivalent definition of homotopy quantum field theory is as a symmetric monoidal functor from @xmath59 to the category of finite dimensional complex vector spaces ( monoidal under tensor product ) .",
    "notice that @xmath59 plays the role of a `` higher '' fundamental groupoid , and just as representations of the fundamental groupoid correspond to flat bundles , representations of @xmath59 give flat `` higher '' bundles .",
    "though more care is needed for higher dimensional theories , rodrigues @xcite has succeeded in producing a cobordism category for each dimension whose multiplicative representations give homotopy quantum field theories .",
    "an example of a 0 + 1-dimensional homotopy quantum field theory is given by a vector bundle with flat connection : the vector space @xmath73 associated to a point @xmath56 in @xmath0 is the fibre over @xmath56 and a map @xmath74 associated to a path from @xmath56 to @xmath75 is given by parallel transport .      turaev @xcite constructs @xmath57-dimensional homotopy quantum field theories from @xmath76-cocycles in @xmath0 .",
    "the construction proceeds as follows .",
    "let @xmath77 be a 2-cocycle and for a loop @xmath2 set @xmath78 where @xmath79 if @xmath80 for @xmath81 such that @xmath82 .",
    "for a cobordism @xmath83 from @xmath84 to @xmath85 pick a singular two - cycle representative @xmath86 of the fundamental class @xmath87\\in h_2(\\sigma,\\partial \\sigma)$ ] and define @xmath88 by @xmath89 where @xmath90 .",
    "if two cocycles differ by a coboundary then the theories constructed above are isomorphic .",
    "this construction produces a _",
    "rank one _ theory i.e. each vector space @xmath91 is one dimensional .",
    "in fact this construction is more general and in a similar way turaev constructs @xmath18-dimensional homotopy quantum field theories starting from @xmath18-cocyles in @xmath0 .",
    "further examples in dimension 1 + 1 can be obtained from frobenius algebras with additional structure . for @xmath20 a discrete group",
    "the first two authors define a _",
    "@xmath20-frobenius algebra _ to be a finite dimensional commutative frobenius algebra with @xmath20-action satisfying @xmath92 .",
    "then for @xmath0 a simply connected space , a @xmath93-frobenius algebra @xmath94 gives a 1 + 1-dimensional homotopy quantum field theory by setting @xmath95 for a single loop @xmath2 . by choosing contractions for each loop ,",
    "all linear maps assigned to @xmath0-cobordisms are determined from those cobordisms whose boundary loops are trivial and these in turn are determined by the @xmath93-frobenius algebra . in particular there is a canonical one - to - one correspondence between homotopy classes of maps from a cylinder to @xmath0 with ends mapped to the basepoint of @xmath0 and the group @xmath93 . the linear map assigned to the cylinder corresponding to @xmath96",
    "is given by multiplication by @xmath97 .",
    "in this case the surface category is equivalent to a labelled version of the category of surfaces without background , as found in the definition of 1 + 1-dimensional tqft .",
    "the morphisms are labelled by elements of @xmath93 and when composing morphisms the labels add .    similarly , for a discrete group @xmath98",
    ", turaev has defined a _ crossed @xmath98-algebra _ to be a @xmath98-graded algebra @xmath99 together with a bilinear form @xmath100 and a @xmath98-action @xmath101",
    "satisfying    * @xmath102 is non - degenerate for @xmath103 and zero otherwise and @xmath104 * @xmath105 is an algebra automorphism preserving @xmath106 such that @xmath107 and @xmath108 and @xmath109 * @xmath110 .",
    "then for @xmath111 a crossed @xmath98-algebra @xmath94 gives a 1 + 1-dimensional homotopy quantum field theory by setting @xmath112}$ ] where we identify homotopy classes of maps from @xmath113 to @xmath114 with @xmath98 and @xmath115 $ ] denotes the homotopy class of @xmath2 .",
    "in fact more is true and turaev @xcite has shown that the category of 1 + 1-dimensional homotopy quantum field theories with target @xmath114 is equivalent to the category of crossed @xmath98-algebras .",
    "similarly the first two authors @xcite have shown that for a simply connected space @xmath0 the category of 1 + 1-dimensional homotopy quantum field theories with target @xmath0 is equivalent to the category of @xmath93-frobenius algebras .",
    "rodrigues @xcite has reformulated the latter to state that the homotopy surface category of a simply connected space is universal for @xmath20-frobenius objects .",
    "this formalises the view that surface and diagram categories encode the axioms for algebraic structures .",
    "further examples of 1 + 1-dimensional theories can be obtained by extending state - sum tqfts to the homotopy quantum field theory setting .",
    "these lattice models have been defined by turaev @xcite and studied by him for @xmath0 an eilenberg - maclane space and studied by rodrigues @xcite for simply connected background . in this approach",
    "one has a cellular structure for each manifold and one uses the map to @xmath0 to label cells .",
    "state sums are then defined ( over appropriate labellings ) for closed manifolds and then extended to homotopy quantum field theories .",
    "rodrigues views this as a way of incorporating matter into lattice topological quantum field theory .",
    "turaev also constructs 2 + 1-dimensional theories from algebraic data @xcite by defining the notion of a modular @xmath98-category which is a generalisation of a modular category and when @xmath0 is contractible and the construction reduces to his construction of a 2 + 1-dimensional tqft from a modular category .",
    "there is already available a notion of `` higher '' line bundle with connection in the form of a _ gerbe _ and in this section we explain the work of u. bunke and the second two authors @xcite relating these to homotopy quantum field theories .",
    "following barrett s work on classifying vector bundles by holonomy @xcite one can modify the definition of the homotopy surface category of a smooth finite dimensional manifold by considering collared smooth cobordisms and demanding invariance under smooth homotopies with rank @xmath116 .",
    "such homotopies are known as _",
    "thin homotopies _ and may be informally characterised as those sweeping out no volume . call this category the _ thin - homotopy surface category _ @xmath117 and define a _",
    "rank one thin invariant field theory with target a smooth manifold @xmath0 _ to be a symmetric multiplicative functor @xmath118 from @xmath117 to the category of one - dimensional vector spaces such that there exists a closed three from @xmath119 on @xmath0 satisfying @xmath120 whenever @xmath121 is an @xmath0-three - manifold .",
    "this last condition guarantees that the functor @xmath118 is suitably smooth .",
    "if the three form @xmath119 is zero we say the thin invariant field theory is _",
    "flat_. though it is not obvious , a flat thin invariant field theory is the same thing as a rank one , normalised homotopy quantum field theory . here _",
    "normalised _ means that for each point , the induced tqft is trivial .",
    "examples of thin invariant field theories can be constructed from gerbes with connection . a gerbe with connection",
    "may be described by its holonomy ( see for example @xcite ) , which in turn can be viewed as a @xmath122-valued function @xmath123 on the space of maps of closed surfaces into @xmath0 .",
    "given such , and supposing that @xmath124 is trivial , it is possible to construct a thin - invariant field theory over @xmath0 as follows . for a loop @xmath2",
    "set @xmath125 where @xmath126 if @xmath127 , where the notation @xmath128 indicates that we are viewing @xmath129 as a closed surface . for a cobordism @xmath130 from @xmath2 to @xmath131 the map @xmath132 is given by composing surfaces as indicated below , where @xmath133 is a generator of @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , for a background space satisfying @xmath134 , this construction sets up a one - to - one correspondence between gerbes with connection on @xmath0 and thin - invariant field theories on @xmath0 .    by virtue of the remarks above about flat thin - invariant field theories and rank one normalised homotopy quantum field theories , another source of ( flat ) thin - invariant field theories is turaev s construction using cocycles .    with some more work",
    "it can be shown ( see @xcite ) that for a general finite dimensional smooth manifold @xmath0 there is a correspondence    @xmath135    in other words a thin - invariant field theory can be viewed as an alternative characterisation of a gerbe .",
    "flat gerbes , it turns out , correspond to flat thin - invariant field theories and hence to rank one , normalised hqfts . by identifying flat gerbes with @xmath136 , this identifies rank one , normalised hqfts on @xmath0 with @xmath136 .",
    "this extends a result of turaev who showed this for @xmath0 and eilenberg - maclane space using the algebraic classification in terms of crossed algebras .",
    "in this section we will discuss another variant of homotopy quantum field theory . elsewhere in this volume",
    "stephen sawin discusses 2-tqfts , which extend tqfts to a three tier structure rather than the usual two tier structure .",
    "a version of homotopy quantum field theory along similar lines has been defined by the first two authors in @xcite .",
    "the approach is to begin by defining the 2-category version of the homotopy surface category of a space and then considering some kind of representations of this .",
    "this approach has been pioneered in the background - free case by tillmann in @xcite .",
    "she considers a 2-category whose objects are one - manifolds , whose morphisms are surfaces and whose 2-morphisms are diffeomorphisms .",
    "she explains how this may be thought of as a discrete approximation to segal s topological category occurring in the definition of cft , which has riemann surfaces as morphisms .",
    "indeed , the classifying space of a morphism category in tillmann s 2-category has the same rational homotopy type as the morphism space in segal s category , thus making the link between tqfts extended to the 2-category setting as above and cft .",
    "generalising this to homotopy quantum field theories is then some way toward approximating the elliptic objects discussed in the first section .",
    "the _ homotopy surface 2-category of @xmath0 _ is the 2-category @xmath137 defined ( roughly ) as follows .",
    "* objects are based continuous functions @xmath138 , for @xmath139 .",
    "* 1-morphisms are continuous functions @xmath140 where @xmath4 is a surface and @xmath97 agrees with source and target boundaries .",
    "* 2-morphisms are orientation preserving diffeomorphisms @xmath141 that fix boundary collars pointwise and such that the following diagram commutes up to basepoint - preserving homotopy relative to the boundary . @xmath142^{t } \\ar[dr]_{g_1 } & & \\sigma_2    \\ar[dl]^{g_2}\\\\ & x}\\ ] ]    2-morphisms are identified if they are in the same component of the mapping class group and 1-morphisms are identified up to limited isotopy",
    ". it would be inappropriate in this short review to present more details ( the 2-category - minded reader will be aware there must be many ) and the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "an _ extended homotopy quantum field theory _ is then defined to be a multiplicative strict 2-functor from @xmath137 to the 2-category of additive , idempotent complete @xmath30-linear categories .",
    "there are other possibilites for the target two category such as 2-vector spaces or those considered by sawin .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 is simply connected and let @xmath143 be the category associated to the circle equipped with the constant map to some basepoint in @xmath0 .",
    "this category inherits a rich algebraic structure , in particular it is a semi - simple balanced category ( monoidal with braiding and twist ) with an action of @xmath93 satisfying a number of further conditions describing the interaction of the action with the balanced structure .",
    "the category @xmath143 also has defined on it an involution @xmath144 ( defined by tillmann ) and it is shown in @xcite that for certain self - dual extended homotopy quantum field theories this provides @xmath143 with a right duality , thus turning @xmath143 into a lax semi - simple tortile category with @xmath93-action .    there is a similar situation for the case when @xmath0 is an eilenberg - maclane space of type @xmath114 , where a self - dual extended homotopy quantum field theory gives rise to a lax version of a tortile @xmath98-category .",
    "a strict tortile @xmath98-category is the same thing as a ribbon @xmath98-category defined by turaev , showing that self dual 1 + 1-dimensional extended homotopy quantum field theories have the expected close connection with and 2 + 1-dimensional homotopy quantum field theories ."
