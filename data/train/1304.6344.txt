    ", this model is used to describe the effects of frustration induced in thin magnetic films by the presence of dipolar interactions ( @xmath19 ) or in two - dimensional charged systems by the presence of an unscreened coulomb interaction ( @xmath20 ) @xcite , see also @xcite for a more detailed introduction to the subject , as well as for previous rigorous results .",
    "the competition between short range ferromagnetic and long - range antiferromagnetic interaction is believed to be responsible for the emergence of non - trivial ",
    "mesoscopic patterns \" in the ground and low - temperature states of the system .",
    "let us be more specific . as proved in @xcite ,",
    "if @xmath21 , with j_c:=_y_1>0 ,  ^z^d-1,then there are exactly two ground states , @xmath22 @xmath23 , and @xmath24 @xmath25 .",
    "note that @xmath5 is the value of the ferromagnetic coupling such that the energy of a straight domain wall configuration , i.e. , a configuration consisting of half the spins minus ( those at the left of a vertical straight plane ) and half the spins plus ( those at the right of the same plane ) , vanishes .",
    "if @xmath26 , the ground state is certainly non - homogeneous .",
    "there is evidence that the transition to the ferromagnetic phase as @xmath8 takes place via a series of  microemulsion phases \" characterized by phase separation on a mesoscopic scale that is large compared to the lattice and small compared to the scale of the whole sample ; see e.g. @xcite for a discussion of this phenomenon in the case of coulomb ( @xmath20 ) and dipolar ( @xmath19 ) interactions .",
    "more precisely , at zero temperature , the transition to the ferromagnetic state is expected to take place via a sequence of transitions between periodic striped or slabbed states , depending on dimensionality , consisting of stripes / slabs ( either vertical or horizontal ) all of constant width @xmath15 and of alternating sign .",
    "if we denote by @xmath27 the energy per site in the thermodynamic limit of periodic striped / slabbed configurations consisting of stripes / slabs all of size @xmath28 , the optimal stripe / slabs width @xmath15 can be obtained by minimizing @xmath27 over @xmath29 , and turns out to be of the order @xmath30 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath31 the optimal striped / slabbed energy per site and by @xmath11 the actual ground state energy per site in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "our main result can be summarized in the following theorem :    as to @xmath32 from below , we have _",

    "( [ 1.1 ] ) is a strong indication of the conjectured periodic striped / slabbed structure of the ground state .",
    "the proof of eq .",
    "( [ 1.1 ] ) comes with explicit bounds on the speed of convergence to the limit , namely = 1+o((j_c - j)^).[1.1bis]it also comes with explicit bounds on the energy cost of the  corners \" .",
    "this notion was introduced in @xcite for the two - dimensional case ; every time that a domain wall bends by 90@xmath33 , hence creating a corner ( or an edge corner , as we call it , in three - dimensions : this is an edge where two plaquettes come together at 90@xmath33 ) , we pay a positive energy cost , at least in the case that the corner density is sufficiently high . combining this remark with our a priori bounds on the ground state energy , we find that the ground state has a density of corners that is smaller than @xmath34 : therefore , if we look in a random window of proper side @xmath35 ( much larger than the optimal stripe / slab width @xmath36 , and much smaller than the typical separation between corners @xmath37 ) , the ground state restricted to such a window is striped / slabbed , with stripes / slabs of width close to the optimal size @xmath15 .",
    "our proof presumably adapts to any dimension , e.g. , @xmath38 or @xmath39 , and the interested reader can extend the arguments in appendix [ appd ] if desired .",
    "the logic of the proof goes as follows .",
    "we first derive an alternative representation of the energy in terms of droplet self - energies and droplet - droplet interactions .",
    "next , for the purpose of a lower bound , we localize the energy into squares / cubes of side @xmath14 ( to be optimized over ) , and we show that the localized self - energy of every droplet with at least one corner along its boundary is positive ; therefore , we can eliminate all such droplets , after which we are left only with striped / slabbed droplets .",
    "finally , reflection positivity shows that the optimal striped / slabbed configuration is periodic .",
    "defining @xmath40 , the optimal periodic striped energy per site has the form : e_s(j)=-c_s ( ) ||^(p - d)/(p - d-1),[2.00]with @xmath41 asymptotically for @xmath42 , for a suitable @xmath43 .",
    "this result follows from the explicit minimization of @xmath27 , see appendix [ app0 ] , and can also be understood in terms of a balance between  line \" or `` plane '' energies and line - line or plane - plane interactions , see ( * ? ? ?",

    "it is at this point that columns are excluded , because a column has many edge corners .",
