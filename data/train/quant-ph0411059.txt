    "spontaneous emission is generally considered a detrimental effect in atom interferometers .",
    "the associated random recoil reduces or even completely destroys the visibility of the interference fringes . in this paper",
    "we describe an atom interferometer where the beam splitter works by means of a spontaneous raman transition . our central question will be whether one can observe interference in such an interferometer which is enabled by a spontaneous process and where decoherence is built into the beam splitting process from the start .",
    "the role of spontaneous emission in ( atom ) interferometers has long been connected to the concept of which - way information , ultimately tracing back to heisenberg s uncertainty principle @xcite .",
    "feynman @xcite discussed a _",
    "gedankenexperiment _ using a heisenberg microscope to determine which slit was taken by a particle in a young s two - slit interferometer .",
    "the scattered photon , needed to determine the position , spoils the interference pattern due to its associated recoil .",
    "similarly , spontaneous emission in an ( atom ) interferometer may provide position information on the atom , while at the same time randomizing the momentum and spoiling interference @xcite . on the other hand , resonance fluorescence , including that from spontaneous raman transitions , is as coherent as the incident light in the limit of low saturation @xcite .",

    "we show that random recoils do not lead to loss of interference as long as the spontaneously emitted photons do not yield which - way information .",
    "can undergo a spontaneous transition to state @xmath0 , either on the ingoing or on the outgoing part of the trajectory .",
    "these two paths possibly interfere , with a phase difference depending on the transition point @xmath1.,width=245 ]    our proposed interferometer is based on cold atoms that reflect from an evescent - wave ( ew ) mirror .",
    "our model atom is a typical alkali atom with two hyperfine ground states . during the reflection from the ew mirror",
    "the atoms can make a spontaneous raman transition to the other hyperfine state .",
    "when the repulsive potential experienced by the final state is lower , the atoms lose kinetic energy and hence bounce inelastically from the potential @xcite .",
    "this sisyphus process has been investigated previously @xcite and the resulting final velocity distribution has been shown to be a caustic @xcite , reminiscent of the rainbow . furthermore it is used in several experiments as the loading process of ( low - dimensional ) traps for atoms @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite observed the analog of stckelberg oscillations in the transverse velocity distribution of atoms that reflect elastically from a corrugated ew potential .",
    "however , no stochastic or incoherent processes were involved .    in our case",
    "the final velocity of an atom depends on the position where it made the raman transfer @xcite .",
    "looking at the trajectories in detail we see that each final velocity can be reached by two trajectories , as is shown in fig .",
    "an atom can be transferred to the second state on the ingoing or the outgoing part of its trajectory .",
    "interference will manifest itself in the velocity distribution of the reflected atoms , since the outgoing velocity depends on the transition point @xmath1 .",
    "note that the beam splitter , its role being played by a spontaneous raman transition , is highly non - unitary : atoms are only transferred from state @xmath2 to state @xmath0 and not vice versa .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "we first present a semi - classical picture , and use it to make qualitative predictions about the behavior of the interference effects , if present . the question whether interference is possible",
    "will be answered by solving the schrdinger equation in two different ways",
    ". the first approach will employ stationary analytical solutions of the time - independent schrdinger equation , but is limited to monochromatic wave functions .",
    "the second approach will propagate a wave packet by numerically integrating the time - dependent schrdinger equation with random quantum jumps describing the raman transitions . the last section deals with experimental considerations .",
    "the analysis will be for a two - level atom , and only the motion of the atom in the direction along the ew - potential gradient will be considered .",
    "the calculations throughout this paper will assume a low saturation parameter , so that depletion of the initial state can be neglected .",
    "an atom in state @xmath2 that reflects from an ew mirror experiences a potential @xmath3 , with @xmath4 the decay length of the ew field .",
    "the atom s trajectory through phase - space is given by @xmath5 $ ] , with @xmath6 the velocity with which the atom enters the potential , see fig .",

    "@xmath8 the atom experiences a potential @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the factor by which the potential energy is reduced after the raman transition .",
    "the atom continues its way through phase space on a new trajectory @xmath11 , given by @xmath12 $ ] , with @xmath13 the asymptotic velocity with which the atom leaves the potential .",
    "the final velocity can have any value between @xmath14 , which corresponds to a transfer in the turning point , and @xmath15 , which corresponds to a transfer outside the ew potential .",
    "the final velocity depends on the atom s velocity @xmath16 at the moment of the transfer to state @xmath0 .",
    "this dependence is given by @xmath17 , from which it is clear that two values @xmath18 lead to the same final velocity @xmath13 .",

    "( b ) the accumulated phase difference between these two paths , indicated by the enclosed gray area , may give rise to interference effects .",
    "( c ) a momentum kick due to the spontaneous recoil gives rise to an extra phase contribution . ]    in a semi - classical picture the atom can be treated as a wave packet which is subject to heisenberg s uncertainty relation @xmath24 .",
    "the distribution of uncertainty between position @xmath1 and momentum @xmath25 is determined by the experimental preparation procedure of the atoms . for a wave packet that initially has a large spread in momentum ,",
    "it is not possible to unambiguously determine the phase difference between the two possible paths , since the wave packet is spread out over several classical trajectories through phase space .",
    "this is indicated by the light grey area in fig . [",
    "fig2](a ) .",
    "it is , however , possible to determine whether the transfer to state @xmath0 is on the ingoing or outgoing path , by observing the timing of the spontaneously emitted photon .",
    "therefore , it is not expected that wave packets with this shape show interference . on the other hand ,",
    "a minimum uncertainty wave packet with a narrow initial momentum spread will more closely follow a classical trajectory through phase space .",
    "this is indicated by the dark grey area in fig . [",
    "fig2](a ) .",
    "the phase difference between the two paths is well defined .",
    "the two points in phase space , a and a , where a transition to the final trajectory is possible are covered simultaneously by the wave packet . thus no which - way information can be obtained by observing the time of emission of the spontaneously emitted photon .",
    "the initial trade - off between position and momentum uncertainty in a bandwidth limited wave packet determines whether interference can be a priori excluded or not .",
    "the random direction of the spontaneously emitted photon can be taken into account in the motion of the atom by a random momentum jump .",
    "this makes the atom propagate on a different trajectory through phase space than it would have without the random recoil .",
    "the momentum changes are indicated by horizontal arrows in the phase - space diagram of fig . [ fig2](c ) . for a single atom , or a collection of distinguishable atoms ,",
    "the spontaneous recoil could be measured by detecting the direction in which the photon was emitted . due to this possibility",
    "there will be a set of interference patterns , one for each recoil direction . by disregarding the information present in the scattered photons",
    ", we probe the incoherent sum of all these interference patterns .",
    "the phase difference between the two paths is different with respect to the recoil free case , and it depends on the direction of the recoil .",
    "it is indicated by the gray areas in fig . [ fig2](c ) . in order for the interference to be experimentally observable",
    "the difference between the interference patterns with a certain recoil direction should not be too large .",
    "this means that the phase difference between recoil components in the @xmath26 directions should be less than @xmath27 . for larger final velocities",
    "these phase corrections get larger as is apparent from comparing the areas around the point b with the areas around point a in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) .",
    "we thus expect the visibility of the interference to decrease for larger final velocities .",
    "note that which - way information can neither be retrieved from a measurement of the frequency @xmath28 of the emitted photon .",
    "this frequency is determined by energy conservation : @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the frequency of the evanescent photon and @xmath31 is the energy difference between states @xmath2 and @xmath0 . because the initial and final kinetic energies are equal for both trajectories , the frequency of the spontaneously emitted photon is equal for both interfering paths .",
    "the question whether interference is visible will be answered in this section by considering analytical solutions of the time - independent schrdinger equation @xmath32 describing stationary states with a total energy @xmath33 on the potential @xmath3 .",
    "it thus describes particles with momenta @xmath34 in the asymptotic limit of large @xmath1 .",
    "this is one of the few examples where the eigenfunctions of the schrdinger equation are known analytically .",
    "the solutions are given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the bessel - k function of order @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "these functions are normalized such that the asymptotic density is independent of @xmath38 .",
    "they are also given by @xcite where a different normalization is used .",
    "this wave function describes the atoms that are incident in state @xmath2 .",
    "after the spontaneous raman transition to state @xmath0 , the atoms are described by one of the eigenfunctions @xmath39 with final momentum @xmath40 in the potential @xmath41 .",
    "the final wave function in momentum space is given by the overlap integral @xmath42 where the recoil due to the absorbed evanescent photon is taken into account by the factor @xmath43 and the recoil due to the spontaneously emitted photon by the factor @xmath44 , with @xmath45 the momentum component of the recoil in the @xmath1 direction .",
    "as already discussed there will be interference patterns @xmath46 for every value @xmath45 of the recoil . a measurement that disregards the emitted photon yields the sum of all these possible interference patterns . in this derivation",
    "we will assume an isotropic distribution of the recoil momentum @xmath45 .",
    "this is an approximation , since the distribution depends on the polarization of the spontaneously emitted photon . we will come back to this point in section [ sec5 ]",

    "the upper ( lower ) triangle corresponds to a trajectory where the raman transfer took place on the outgoing ( incoming ) branch .",
    "only the region on the left of the triangles is reachable by two trajectories and thus shows interference .",
    "the left dashed curve is reached by atoms that scatter a photon near the turning point .",
    "note that in this case the photon recoil has only a small influence on the final momentum @xmath40 .",
    "the final momentum is mainly determined by the potential energy near the turning point that is converted to kinetic energy .",
    "the amount of kinetic energy that can be added or removed by the photon recoil near the turning point is small because the atomic velocity is small . as a result",
    "we see only a slight curvature as a function of the recoil @xmath54 . for larger values of the initial momentum @xmath38 or the ratio @xmath55 the left curve will become more and more straight .    as expected , the main part of the momentum distribution is in the classically allowed regions .",

    "although the region with interference is smaller for larger values of the recoil , the remaining interference fringes are present at more or less the same final momenta .",
    "this indicates that the spontaneous recoil does not completely wash out the interference .",
    "the behavior of the interference does not depend on the sign of the recoil , because a photon that is emitted on the ingoing part of the trajectory has the same effect on the momentum distribution as a photon that is emitted in the opposite direction on the outgoing part of the trajectory .",

    "furthermore , as predicted for the case of an incoherent interferometer , the visibility of the graphs in which the effect of the recoil has been taken into account decreases for larger final momenta .",
    "in the previous section we have shown that the incoherent nature of the spontaneous raman transfer does not prevent us from observing interference . in this section",

    "the recoil distribution in the @xmath1-direction due to such a photon is given by @xmath92 .",
    "intensity distributions of dipole radiation are given by e.g. @xcite . since this distribution has a maximum for @xmath93 , for which the recoil - dependent interference patterns are most pronounced as is visible in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the visibility of the interference signals will be slightly better than presented in this paper .",

    "the evaluation in _ mathematica _ @xcite of the bessel - k functions of high imaginary order becomes very slow . for the time - dependent approach",
    "the number of sampling points , necessary for the numerical evaluation , becomes too large due to the highly oscillatory character of the incident wave packet .",
    "however , we expect even better signals for realistic values for the initial velocity @xmath21 , so the calculation represents a worst case .    by numerically solving the schrdinger equation we can now reply with an unambiguous yes to the question _ can the beamsplitter in an atom interferometer work on the basis of spontaneous emission ? _",
    "the intuitive objections to whether this is possible have been refuted .",
    "the semi - classical arguments have been confirmed by the full quantum - mechanical calculations .",
    "which - way information due to the possibility of detecting the time of emission of the spontaneously emitted photon is avoided by choosing a sufficiently narrow velocity uncertainty .",
    "a wave packet covers both transfer points in phase space simultaneously if its velocity is defined accurately enough .",
    "the incoherent nature of a spontaneous emission process due to the random recoil direction of the atom is visible in all the calculated interference curves , but does not lead to a complete scrambling of the interference . for larger final velocities , for which the transfer points are separated more and",
    "the acquired random phase is consequently larger , the visibility of the interference fringes indeed decreases .",
    "furthermore the fringe period indeed qualitatively shows the behavior that was predicted on the basis of the semi - classical calculations .",
    "our analysis also shows that the absence or presence of which - way information is not the same as the perturbing effect of the recoils due to spontaneous transitions .",
    "this is most clearly seen in fig .",
