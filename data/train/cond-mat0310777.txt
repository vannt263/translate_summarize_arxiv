    "enumeration of hamiltonian walks ( hws ) , i.e. self - avoiding walks ( saws ) that visit every site of a given lattice , is a classic problem in graph theory , but it also has an important role in the study of the configurational statistics of polymers .",
    "hws are used to model collapsed polymers @xcite , polymer melting @xcite , as well as protein folding @xcite .",
    "the number of all possible hws on a lattice is related to the configurational entropy of a collapsed polymer system , and also to the optimal solutions to the traveling salesman problem @xcite .",
    "enumeration of hws , closed or open , is a difficult combinatorial problem , which has been exactly solved only for few lattices , namely , the two - dimensional manhattan oriented square lattice @xcite , the two - dimensional ice lattice @xcite , the two - dimensional hexagonal lattice @xcite , the sierpinski gasket fractal @xcite , and the 4-simplex fractal @xcite .",
    "the number of hws has also been calculated numerically for various lattices by means of direct enumeration @xcite , transfer matrix methods @xcite , and monte carlo estimates @xcite .",
    "the field theory representation for this problem was introduced in @xcite , and further developed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to understand the topological properties of hamiltonian walks on several families of fractal lattices . in order to do this we study the asymptotic behavior of the number of closed hws @xmath2 for a large number of vertices @xmath3",
    "this analysis yields the values of the so - called connectivity constant @xmath1 which has the physical meaning of the average number of steps available to the walker having already completed a large number of steps .",
    "it also provides insight into the spatial distribution of walks present at large @xmath3 ; this can be related to detailed studies of knot delocalisation in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the number @xmath2 is for homogeneous lattices with @xmath4 expected to take the form @xmath5 here @xmath1 is the connectivity constant and the term with @xmath6 represents a surface correction ( @xmath7 ) , with @xmath8 ( @xmath9 being the dimensionality of the lattice ) .",
    "this differs from the ordinary saw case , where no surface term @xmath10 is expected , i.e. the number of saws of length @xmath3 behaves as @xmath11 for large @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , the exponent @xmath12 is universal in the saw case , i.e. it depends only on the dimensionality of the lattice , whereas for hws it may depend on other , not yet identified characteristics of the lattice . to the lowest approximation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : asimptotika ] ) @xmath13 , and the connectivity constant can be defined as @xmath14    for a better understanding of these problems it is helpful to study hws on fractal lattices . as was first recognized by bradley @xcite ,",
    "the self - similarity of fractal lattices is a useful tool for the exact and computationally fast iterative generation and enumeration of all hws on an unlimitedly large corresponding fractal structure . in this paper",
    "we extend bradley s algorithm to two and three  dimensional sierpinski fractal families , as well as @xmath0simplex fractals with @xmath15 .",
    "we consider several families of fractals in order to compare the obtained results and be able to draw more general conclusions about the character of the hamiltonian walks on different classes of lattices . in the case of the two  dimensional sierpinski fractal family an exact closed form result for the connectivity constant",
    "is obtained due to the simple form of the recursion relations for the numbers of hws .",
    "for the three - dimensional sierpinski fractals which can model physically more frequently encountered systems a numerical approach is necessary .",
    "the study of asymptotics of the number of hws shows that the surface term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : asimptotika ] ) only appears for fractals on which the collapse transition from the polymer coil to the globule phase is possible .",
    "this is the same class of lattices for which delocalised hws dominate over localised ones for large @xmath3 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the two  dimensional sierpinski fractal family and obtain exact recursion relations for the number of hws , as well as the closed exact formula for @xmath1 .",
    "recursion relations for hws on three  dimensional sierpinski fractals are given and analyzed in section 3 .",
    "a similar method for analyzing hws on 5- and 6-simplex lattices is presented in section 4 .",
    "finally , in section 5 we discuss all our findings and related results obtained by other authors .",
    "we begin by defining the two - dimensional ( 2d ) sierpinski fractal family .",
    "each member of the 2d sf family ( labeled by @xmath16 ) can be constructed recursively , starting with an equilateral triangle that contains @xmath17 smaller equilateral triangles ( generator @xmath18 ) .",
    "the subsequent fractal stages are constructed self  similarly , by replacing each of the @xmath19 upward  oriented small triangles of the initial generator by a new generator . to obtain the @xmath20th  stage fractal lattice @xmath21 , which we shall call the @xmath20th order generator , this process of construction has to be repeated @xmath22 times , and the complete fractal is obtained in the limit @xmath23 .",
    "it is easy to see that , for any 2d sf , each closed hw on the @xmath24th generator is comprised of hws which enter and exit @xmath20th order generators .",
    "let @xmath25 be the number of closed hws on the @xmath20th order generator , whereas @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the numbers of hws which enter the @xmath20th order generator at one vertex , and leave it at the other , with or without visiting its third vertex , respectively .",
    "then , it can be shown that a simple relation @xmath28 is valid for @xmath29 ( see appendix a ) . here",
    "@xmath30 is a constant that depends only on sf parameter @xmath16 , whereas exponents @xmath31 and @xmath32 are equal to @xmath33 for instance , the explicit form of the relation ( [ eq : zatvorene2dsf ] ) for @xmath34 is @xmath35 and for @xmath36 : @xmath37 , which is illustrated in figure   [ fig : cl ] .    th order generators @xmath38 ( a ) and @xmath39 ( b ) for @xmath34 and @xmath36 two - dimensional sierpinski fractals , with the possible closed hamiltonian walks configurations depicted .",
    "the small up - oriented triangles are the respective @xmath20th order generators , and the lines that traverse them represent the open hamiltonian walks.,width=302 ]    one can also show ( appendix a ) that numbers @xmath26 and @xmath27 of open hws obey the following closed set of recursion relations @xmath40 for all @xmath29 , where @xmath41 is again a constant , different for every @xmath16 , and @xmath42 for @xmath34 these relations have the form : @xmath43 , @xmath44 and for @xmath36 : @xmath45 , @xmath46 ( see figure  [ fig : recursg ] ) .",
    "type on @xmath36 two - dimensional sierpinski fractal structures.,width=377 ]    from the relations ( [ eq : otvorene2dsf ] ) it follows straightforwardly that @xmath47 for any @xmath29 , so that from ( [ eq : zatvorene2dsf ] ) and ( [ eq : eksponenti1 ] ) one gets @xmath48 .",
    "since the number @xmath49 of sites on the @xmath20th order generator satisfies the recursion relation @xmath50 according to ( [ eq : definicija ] ) it then follows that @xmath51 on the other hand , from ( [ eq : otvorene2dsf ] ) , ( [ eq : eksponenti2 ] ) , and ( [ eq : odnos ] ) one has @xmath52 , i.e. @xmath53 satisfies the difference equation @xmath54 , whose solution is @xmath55^l}\\over{1-[b(b+1)/2]}}\\ln(ak^y)+ \\left({{b(b+1)}\\over 2}\\right)^l\\ln h_1 \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : hkonacno}\\ ] ] from this equation , together with the explicit expression for the number of sites @xmath56 which follows directly from the relation ( [ eq : cvorovi ] ) , one can derive the general form @xmath57 of the connectivity constant ( [ eq : definicija ] ) for hws on two  dimensional sfs .",
    "consequently , in order to calculate @xmath1 for any particular 2d sf , one should find the numbers @xmath58 and @xmath59 of open hws on the generator , and the number @xmath41 of all hamiltonian configurations which are relevant for recursion relations ( [ eq : otvorene2dsf ] ) . in table 1",

    "as one can see , for @xmath34 , and @xmath36 the numbers @xmath59 , @xmath58 , and @xmath41 are small and can be directly enumerated , whereas for larger values of @xmath16 they quickly increase , so that enumeration should be computerized ( calculation of the numbers @xmath41 , @xmath59 , and @xmath58 required 13 minutes for @xmath69 case , and about 100 hours for @xmath70 , both on a computer with a processor mips r10000 , rev 2.6 on 180 mhz ) .",
    "one should mention that the connectivity constant for the sierpinski gasket ( @xmath34 ) has already been calculated in a different way by bradley @xcite .",
    "combining equations ( [ eq : hkonacno ] ) , ( [ eq : cvorovi2 ] ) and ( [ eq : closedform ] ) it is not difficult to see that @xmath71 , where @xmath72 depends only on @xmath16 , and correspondingly @xmath73 . comparing with ( [ eq : asimptotika ] ) one can conclude that neither surface nor power correction terms are present in the scaling form for the number of closed hws on two - dimensional sierpinski fractals .",
    "it is interesting to compare the value of the connectivity constant obtained for the case of hamiltonian walks to that corresponding to all possible self - avoiding configurations on 2d sfs .",
    "our algorithm for enumerating hws is easily adjusted for that purpose . by means of exact renormalization group ( rg ) approach @xcite ,",
    "these configurations can be used for calculating the connectivity constant @xmath74 for ordinary saws , which was done earlier only for the @xmath34 case @xcite . here",
    "we extend an exact rg calculation of the connectivity constant @xmath74 for any @xmath16 .    the connectivity constant @xmath74 for the saw model is equal to @xmath75 , where @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) is the average number of distinct open ( closed ) @xmath0step saws . in order to calculate @xmath74 within the exact rg approach",
    ", one should introduce two generating functions @xmath78 and @xmath79 : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the statistical weight of each step of the saw ( fugacity ) , whereas @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) is the number of saws which enter the @xmath20th order generator @xmath84 at one vertex , and leave it at the second , without ( with ) visiting the third one .",
    "for every 2d sf lattice functions @xmath30 and @xmath85 obey recursion relations of the following form @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are coefficients that do not depend on @xmath20 , but do depend on the fractal parameter @xmath16 .",
    "the initial conditions are @xmath89 , @xmath90 and the connectivity constant @xmath74 is equal to @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the value of the fugacity for which one approaches the fixed point @xmath93 of ( [ eq : recurb ] ) , after a large ( infinite ) number of iterations .",
    "the explicit rg recursion relations for 2d sfs with @xmath34 are @xmath94 and for @xmath36 : @xmath95 whereas relations for @xmath96 and 5 are given in appendix b. for @xmath97 and 7 rg relations are too cumbersome to be quoted here , but they are available upon request",
    ". underlined terms in quoted rg relations correspond to the hamiltonian configurations , as one can check by direct comparison with relations ( [ eq : otvorene2dsf ] ) ; replacing @xmath27 and @xmath26 in ( [ eq : otvorene2dsf ] ) by @xmath30 and @xmath85 , respectively , one obtains underlined terms in the rg relations ( values of coefficient @xmath41 are given in table 1 ) .",
    "it is obvious that for larger @xmath16 values the number of saw configurations is much larger than the number of hamiltonian configurations , and for that reason we were not able to enumerate all saw configurations on 2d sf beyond @xmath69 .    for all @xmath16 considered here recursive relations ( [ eq : recurb ] )",
    "have only one nontrivial fixed point @xmath98 , where @xmath99 lies in the interval @xmath100 .",
    "one can check that by setting @xmath101 in ( [ eq : recurb ] ) rg equations used in @xcite for calculating critical exponent @xmath102 ( connected with the mean end - to - end distance ) for saws on 2d sfs are recovered .",
    "of course , saw model treated in @xcite is slightly different ( each unit triangle within the fractal can be traversed only along one side ) from the usual one , treated here , but both of them belong to the same universality class , i.e. the critical exponent @xmath102 is equal for both considered saw models .",
    "this is not the case with the connectivity constant , which is a nonuniversal quantity , so an extra rg parameter @xmath85 had to be introduced .",
    "the final rg results @xmath103 for the saw connectivity constant are given in the last column of table 1 , together with the corresponding values @xmath104 obtained in @xcite using a graph counting technique .",
    "as one can expect , the connectivity constant @xmath74 for saw is larger than @xmath1 for hw model , for every considered sf , since the physical meaning of the connectivity constant is the average number of steps available to the walker after @xmath3 steps completed , for large @xmath3 .",
    "one can also see that the values of @xmath74 obtained by two different methods for @xmath96 and 5 are not in good agreement .",
    "the rg method applied here is exact , implying that numerical estimations within the graph counting technique used in @xcite were not accurate enough .",
    "we proceed by analyzing the properties of hws on the three  dimensional ( 3d ) sf family .",
    "a 3d sf can be constructed recursively as in the 2d case , the only difference being that the generator @xmath105 of the fractal with the parameter @xmath16 is no longer a triangle , but a tetrahedron that contains @xmath106 upward oriented smaller tetrahedrons .",
    "consequently , one should observe four types of open hws that traverse the @xmath20th order generator in order to obtain the overall number of closed hws on 3d sf .",
    "the first three types are hws which enter the generator at one vertex and leave it at another , meanwhile    * visiting the third , but not the fourth vertex ( @xmath107type ) , * visiting both the third and the fourth vertex ( @xmath108type ) , * visiting neither the third nor the fourth vertex ( @xmath109type ) .",
    "hws of the fourth possible type ( @xmath110type ) consist of two self - avoiding branches , and correspond to the walks that enter the generator and leave it without visiting the remaining two vertices , then , after visiting other parts of the lattice , enter the same generator again at the third corner vertex and finally leave it at the fourth corner vertex .",
    "examples of these types of walks are sketched in figure 3 .    .",
    "vertices not visited by the hamiltonian walker are encircled.,width=377 ]    in principle , it is possible to establish a closed set of recursion relations for the numbers @xmath111 , and @xmath112 of the corresponding walks for any 3d sf in the following form @xmath113 where @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 are the numbers of open hamiltonian configurations of the corresponding types , with @xmath0 branches of the @xmath107type , @xmath118 branches of the @xmath108type , @xmath119 branches of the @xmath109type , and @xmath120 $ ] branches of the @xmath110type . the number @xmath121 of all closed hws within the @xmath24th order generator for any @xmath16 is equal to @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the number of all closed hamiltonian configurations with @xmath0 branches of the @xmath107type , @xmath118 branches of the @xmath108type , @xmath119 branches of the @xmath109type , and @xmath120 $ ] branches of the @xmath110type .",
    "as one can see , the recursion relations ( [ eq : recursf3d ] ) for the number of open hws on 3d sierpinski fractals are much more complicated than the corresponding equations ( [ eq : otvorene2dsf ] ) for 2d sfs .",
    "consequently , it is not possible to find explicit expression , similar to ( [ eq : closedform ] ) , for the connectivity constant @xmath1 .",
    "instead , one should perform a numerical analysis of the recursion relations ( [ eq : recursf3d ] ) in order to find the value of @xmath1 .",
    "we shall demonstrate the method on the particular case of the @xmath34 fractal .    by computer enumeration of the possible hw configurations within the @xmath24th - order generator @xmath124 of the @xmath34 3d sierpinski fractal , we found the following recursion relations : @xmath125 where we have used the prime symbol as a superscript for the numbers of hws on the @xmath24th - order generator @xmath124 and no indices for the @xmath20th - order numbers . from the definition ( [ eq : definicija ] ) of the connectivity constant and the formula for the number @xmath121 of closed hws within @xmath124 : @xmath126 it then follows that @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the number of sites in @xmath129 . on the other hand , from the recursion relation ( [ eq : g3d ] ) for the numbers @xmath27 one obtains @xmath130 where @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 . in a similar way , from ( [ eq : h3d ] )",

    "one can clearly see that @xmath1 increases with @xmath216 , which is in accord with flory @xmath220 and orland _ et al _ @xmath221 formulas , but it is obvious that @xmath1 depends on other lattice properties too .",
    "furthermore , all values of @xmath1 lie between the values predicted by these two formulas , and it seems that these kind of approximations give satisfying results for fractal lattices studied here . based on the information in this figure",

    "it seems that for @xmath228 the connectivity constant might approach its triangular lattice value .",
    "this is not surprising , since for @xmath229 the first step of the construction of the corresponding 2d sf is already the wedge of the triangular lattice . in the same limit ,",
    "3d sfs approach the corresponding three - dimensional euclidean lattice , so it would be useful to obtain recursion relations for hws on these fractals for larger @xmath16 , since there are fewer results for more realistic three - dimensional lattices .",
    "this task requires faster computers , as well as establishing a better algorithm for enumerating the hw configurations within a generator of a fractal , which is something we are planning to do in the nearest future .",
    "as for the correction to the leading - order asymptotic behavior of the number of hws , we have shown that the surface correction @xmath230 appears for neither the two - dimensional sierpinski fractals nor for the 5-simplex lattice .",
    "in contrast , for both three - dimensional sierpinski fractals considered here , as well as for the 4-simplex @xcite and the 6-simplex lattice , the surface correction is present , with the value of the exponent @xmath231 , where @xmath232 is the fractal dimension of the corresponding lattice , and for the @xmath0-simplex lattice @xmath233 . ] .",
    "this result is certainly not a simple generalization of the formula proposed for the homogeneous lattices : @xmath8 .",
    "this is actually not surprising : the correction term @xmath234 in ( [ eq : asimptotika ] ) was originally introduced in order to take into account possible surface tension effects , since at low temperatures a saw forms a compact globule ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "the value @xmath8 for homogeneous lattices then follows from the fact that the surface of such a globule is proportional to @xmath235 . in the case of fractal lattices",
    "it is , however , questionable whether such surface effects exist at all .",
    "for instance , all sites of the @xmath34 3d sf lie on the surface , which is not the case for the @xmath36 3d sf , but for both lattices the number of hws has the correction term @xmath230 . or , in the case of an @xmath0-simplex lattice all sites have the same number @xmath0 of neighbors , and one should not expect any surface correction , but still , for some of them the correction @xmath230 was found .",
    "so , it seems that the term @xmath236 , obtained for some of the studied fractals , does not originate from the surface effects , which is also supported by the fact that @xmath237 is proportional to the mean radius of the globule formed by a hw , and not to its surface .",
    "it is interesting to note here that the existence of the term @xmath236 in the scaling form for the number of hws , coincides with the existence of the polymer coil to globule transition on the corresponding lattice .",
    "as was shown earlier , a polymer chain in a solvent , modeled by saws on the 2d sierpinski fractals @xcite and 5-simplex @xcite can exist only in the swollen phase ; on the 3d sierpinski fractals @xcite , 4-simplex @xcite and 6-simplex @xcite lattices , when the temperature is lowered the polymer undergoes a collapse transition from an expanded state to a globule state ( compact or semi - compact @xcite ) . analyzing the asymptotic behaviour of different types of open hws on fractals one can observe that the collapse transition exists on lattices whose topology allows for the statistical domination of hws which are not localised .",
    "in particular , hws on the 2d sg fractals can not enter a generator of any order more than once , i.e. all the walks are localised . on the 5-simplex fractal",
    "this is possible ( see figure  [ fig:5simplex](a ) ) , but the number @xmath179 of localised hws and the number @xmath180 of delocalised hws ( walks that enter every @xmath20th order 5-simplex twice ) are of the same order ( see ( [ eq : c2_5-simplex_corr ] ) , i.e. the delocalised hws do not dominate . on the other hand , the delocalised hws on the 3d sg fractals ( @xmath110-type , see figure  [ fig:3dsg ] ) and on the 6-simplex ( @xmath180 and @xmath205type , see figure  [ fig:5simplex](b ) ) , as well as on the 4simplex @xcite , are possible , and furthermore , the number of these walks is much larger than the number of the localised hws ( see section  [ sec:3dsg ] and subsection  [ subsec:6simplex ] ) .",
    "this observation strongly resembles the conclusion obtained in a series of recent papers @xcite about the delocalisation of knots in the low - temperature globular phase .",
    "although the term delocalisation was not used in quite the same sense in these two contexts , it seems that the same effect is in question , and this problem deserves further investigation .",
    "finally , the power dependence of the overall number @xmath2 of closed hws on the number of sites @xmath3 of the lattice was found only for the 3d sfs .",
    "a more detailed inspection of the calculation of the exponent @xmath12 for these lattices reveals that @xmath238 the numbers @xmath26 and @xmath169 correspond to the localised open hamiltonian configurations that visit the maximal ( 4 ) and the minimal ( 2 ) number of vertices , respectively , within the generator of order @xmath20 ( see figure  [ fig:3dsg ] ) . in the case of 2d sfs ,",
    "numbers of open configurations visiting the maximal or the minimal number of vertices were @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , and it was shown that the ratio @xmath239=const for every @xmath20 .",
    "consequently , @xmath240 , which may be the formal explanation for the absence of the power correction to the number of hws on 2d sf . on the other hand , on",
    "the @xmath0-simplex lattices only one type of localised hw configurations is possible , so it appears that the power term in the scaling form for the number of hws is obtained on lattices where a larger number of different types of localised configurations is possible .    in conclusion",
    "we can say that the method of exact recursion relations turned out to be very powerful for the generation and the enumeration of extremely long hamiltonian walks on the two- and three - dimensional sierpinski and @xmath0-simplex fractals .",
    "furthermore , it allows for a detailed numerical analysis of hws of different topologies .",
    "this enabled us to find various scaling forms for the number of closed hws on these lattices . in the case of two - dimensional sierpinski fractals ,",
    "a closed - form expression is obtained for the connectivity constant .",
    "very interesting results were obtained for the three - dimensional sierpinski fractals .",
    "this should be utilized for attaining deeper insight into the realistic physical problems which can be modeled by hamiltonian walks .",

    "in this appendix we present the derivation of relations ( [ eq : zatvorene2dsf ] ) and ( [ eq : otvorene2dsf ] ) for open and closed hws on 2d sfs , for general @xmath16 .",
    "it is obvious that the number of closed hws on the @xmath24th order generator is of the form @xmath241 , where @xmath242 is the number of all closed hamiltonian configurations consisting of @xmath243 steps of @xmath108-type and @xmath244 steps of @xmath107-type ( `` step '' is here a part of hw that traverses @xmath20th order generator within the considered @xmath24th order generator ) . by definition ,",
    "closed hw visits all sites of the @xmath24th generator , consequently it traverses all @xmath19 @xmath20th order generators within it , so that @xmath245 on the other hand , every @xmath108-type step occupies all three vertices of the @xmath20th generator it traverses , whereas a @xmath107-type step occupies only two vertices ( the entering and the exiting one ) .",
    "this means that the numbers @xmath243 and @xmath244 also have to satisfy the following equation @xmath246 since the number of @xmath20th order vertices inside the ( @xmath178)th generator is @xmath247 .",
    "the system of equations ( [ eq : prva ] ) and ( [ eq : druga ] ) has a unique solution @xmath248 , @xmath249 which completes the derivation of the relation ( [ eq : zatvorene2dsf ] ) .    for open @xmath108-type hws , in a similar way",

    "in this appendix we give exact rg equations ( [ eq : recurb ] ) for calculating the connectivity constant for the ordinary saw model on the @xmath96 and the @xmath261 two - dimensional sierpinski fractals .",
