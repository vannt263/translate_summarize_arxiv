    "in strongly coupled dusty plasmas @xcite , consisting of micron - sized , highly charged particles , the interaction of the dust particles in many cases can be well approximated by the yukawa potential .",
    "other systems for which this type of potential is also appropriate include charged colloids @xcite and high energy density matter @xcite .    the interparticle yukawa potential energy in these systems , @xmath0 accounts for the coulomb repulsion of the particles originating from their like charges ( @xmath1 ) and the screening of the plasma which surrounds the dust particles .",
    "screening is characterized by the dimensionless ratio @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the wigner - seitz radius and @xmath4 is the screening length .",
    "the coupling parameter @xmath5 is a measure of interparticle potential energy as compared to kinetic energy .",
    "defined as @xmath6 , it varies inversely with temperature @xmath7 . in the strong - coupling domain",
    "@xmath8 1 , the system behaves like a non - ideal gas , liquid , and then solid , as @xmath5 increases .",
    "dusty plasmas in nature and in laboratory environments appear in both three - dimensional ( 3d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) settings .",
    "a notable type of 2d systems is a layer of dust particles levitated in gaseous discharges . during the past decade",
    "this latter system has been investigated both experimentally and by different theoretical and simulation approaches .",
    "these studies at first mainly concerned the self - organized crystalline state of the system @xcite .",
    "propagation of compressional and shear waves has been studied and dispersion properties of these waves have been determined @xcite . using perturbation methods the generation of mach cones and nonlinear waves",
    "has also been investigated @xcite .",
    "time scales in these 2d dusty plasma suspensions are characterized by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the dust particle mass .",
    "these crystals can be melted , to produce an interesting liquid state , by changing the plasma parameters or by using laser heating techniques @xcite .",
    "the strongly - coupled liquid state , established this way , has already attracted the interest in a series of experiments aimed at the observation of waves @xcite , as well as studies of transport processes @xcite .",
    "apart from experiments , combined theoretical and simulation studies have recently been carried out in order to uncover thermodynamic and structural properties @xcite as well as collective excitations @xcite of two - dimensional yukawa liquids .",
    "studies of transport properties in such 2d systems are especially interesting due to the fact that doubts about the existence of transport coefficients in low dimensional systems have been raised on theoretical grounds @xcite .",
    "experiments with dusty plasmas are invariably nonequilibrium problems , with a constant energy input and frictional energy loss .",
    "the energy input can be provided by ion flow or electric field fluctuations that propagate into the dust suspension from an outside source , or by external manipulation using for example laser radiation pressure .",
    "a major source of friction is gas drag experienced by the solid dust particles as they move through ambient neutral gas . at steady - state ,",
    "the temperature is determined by a balance of the energy input and dissipation .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations have successfully been used for the determination of the self - diffusion @xcite , the shear viscosity @xcite and the thermal conductivity @xcite coefficients of 3d yukawa liquids .    in general , valid transport coefficients are more likely to exist in 3d liquids than in 2d . here",
    "we will investigate 2d liquids .",
    "the first question to address is not how large a transport coefficient is , but rather does it exist at all . assessing",
    "the existence of diffusion , shear viscosity and thermal conductivity coefficients in 2d yukawa systems is the aim of this paper .    assessing the existence of a transport coefficient in 2d yukawa liquids based on simulation data has until now sometimes relied on qualitative judgments and data that covered too short a time span . here",
    "we will attempt to improve on both of those limitations .",
    "we will use a larger system size , allowing us to calculate autocorrelation functions that are meaningful over a longer time span .",
    "we will reduce the qualitative aspect of the judgment by introducing quantitative analysis methods making use of student s t - statistics to conclude whether a correlation function decays faster than @xmath11 .",
    "we will also implement other improvements in the fitting that is part of the analysis , first to avoid errors that were previously caused by including the initial decay portions of the autocorrelation function(s ) , and second to generate error values required for the student s t - statistics .",
    "our assessment in the end can not be viewed as a final word on the existence of a transport coefficient , but rather as an improved estimate that could in the future be improved further , especially with greater computational power to provide better signal - to - noise ratios and even longer time spans .    in sec .",

    "for equilibrium systems , without gradients , transport coefficients are calculated using the green - kubo relations .",
    "for the three transport coefficients of interest here , these are given as follows @xcite .",
    "for the diffusion coefficient , @xmath12 , @xmath13 the integrand @xmath14 is the velocity autocorrelation function ( vacf ) .    for shear viscosity , @xmath15 , @xmath16 where the integrand @xmath17 is the shear stress autocorrelation function ( sacf ) .    for thermal conductivity @xmath18 , @xmath19 where the integrand @xmath20 is the energy current autocorrelation function ( eacf )",

    "( [ eq : gk1])-([eq : gk3 ] ) must decay rapidly enough for the integral to converge .",
    "this rapid decay for convergence is the essential requirement that we test in this paper . in examining their decay ,",
    "it is crucial to examine the _ long - time _ behavior . since the green - kubo integrals in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gk1])-([eq : gk3 ] ) extend in principle to infinity , what is really needed is information about the integrands as @xmath28 .",
    "however , a numerical simulation is of course limited to a finite time span .",
    "this is one reason that a conclusion regarding the existence of a transport coefficient can not be definitive when based on a simulation .",
    "advances in computational power over the years will allow longer time spans , so that conclusions regarding the existence of a transport coefficient can change . here",
    "we take a step in this gradual improvement by using a bigger simulation size , which allows a longer time span .    for the purpose of illustrating the autocorrelation functions , we present some examples in fig .  [",
    "fig : threecurves ] .",
    "curves are shown for @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , all computed for a cool liquid ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) .",
    "[ fig : threecurves ] actually shows @xmath34 , as this function may acquire negative values even at `` early '' times due to caged motion of particles . )",
    "we plot the data on log - log axes so that a power law behavior appears as a straight line .",
    "examining @xmath29 in fig .",
    "[ fig : threecurves ] , we identify three portions of the time series .",
    "our analysis will include only the central one of these three portions .",
    "first , there are _ initial decaying oscillations _ in the correlation function .",
    "these are associated with caged particle motion , and are not of interest for diffusion .    in the middle , there is a portion we term _",
    "smooth decay_. this portion of the correlation function is what we seek to analyze , by examining and fitting it to determine whether it decays faster than @xmath11 .",
    "finally , the smooth decay ends one of two ways : either a _ sound peak _ as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : threecurves ] for @xmath29 and @xmath30 , or _",
    "noise oscillations with a zero crossing _ as seen here for @xmath31 .",
    "the sound peak occurs at a time that is the ratio of the length of the simulation box divided by the sound speed .",
    "correlation data after the sound peak can be meaningless , especially in a solid or a cold liquid , because of the periodic boundary conditions , which mean that a sound wave that exits the box will re - enter the box from the other side . at long times , when the correlation function has diminished to a small value , it is obscured by noise , which can appear as oscillations crossing zero .",
    "we will not analyze data after a sound peak , or a zero crossing , whichever comes first .",
    "in the study of liquids , long - time tails of autocorrelation functions have been the focus of numerous investigations .",
    "these have included both 3d and 2d systems , with various interparticle potentials .",
    "non - exponential long - time tails in the vacf of _ hard sphere and hard disk _ systems were first reported by alder and wainwright @xcite .",
    "for the 2d case they observed a @xmath35 decay of the tail of the vacf , which makes the vacf non - integrable . as a consequence ,",
    "the diffusion coefficient was claimed not to exist for this system .",
    "further , ernst _",
    "@xcite have shown that the _ kinetic contributions _ to the autocorrelation functions of shear stress and energy current  which are related to velocity correlations  exhibit the same behavior .",
    "their findings were also confirmed by the calculations of dorfman and cohen @xcite . regarding systems with continuous potentials , power law decay of the vacf",
    "was observed in 3d soft - repulsive and lennard - jones liquids @xcite .",
    "a @xmath36 tail of the sacf was found in molecular dynamics simulations in the case of 2d soft disk fluid @xcite . for the case of coulomb interaction ( 2d classical electron liquid )",
    "the existence of self - diffusion coeffiicent has been a topic of controversy @xcite .    for thermal conductivity ,",
    "the present authors are aware of experiments but no previous simulation or theory for a strictly 2d ( monolayer ) yukawa liquid .",
    "a recent experimental measurement of the thermal conductivity was reported for a 2d liquid in @xcite , following earlier measurements in 2d crystals @xcite and liquids in a quasi-2d system @xcite .",
    "the situation for self - diffusion and shear viscosity in 2d yukawa liquids is different , as the literature includes both experimental and simulation studies .",
    "these have yielded estimates of the self - diffusion coefficient @xcite and the shear viscosity @xcite .",
    "thus , our goals here will include reporting , apparently for the first time , a simulation for thermal conductivity in 2d yukawa liquids , as well as an improvement over previous simulations for diffusion and viscosity .    for diffusion , earlier equilibrium md simulations of 2d yukawa liquids , restricted to @xmath37 = 0.56 , predicted that superdiffusion rather than diffusion occurs over a wide range of temperatures @xcite .",
    "they also predicted that @xmath12 exists in the nonideal gas phase and near the disordering transition @xcite , and that the stokes - einstein relation @xmath38 is violated very near the disordering transition .",
    "recent simulations @xcite motivated by an experiment on the shear viscosity in 2d yukawa liquids using a dusty plasma monolayer @xcite indicated a fast decay of the sacf that allowed a calculation of a viscosity coefficient .",
    "non - equilibrium simulations of the same system @xcite did not show significant sensitivity of the results on system size and allowed an identification of non - newtonian behavior under high shear rates .",
    "interest in systems characterized by soft potentials motivates our investigations of 2d yukawa liquids .",
    "our aim is to carry out a systematic study of the time correlation functions and to investigate the existence of the related transport coefficients of 2d yukawa liquids , covering a wide range of the @xmath5 and @xmath37 parameters .",
    "such investigations are especially timely now as very recent large - scale simulations of isobe of a 2d hard disk fluid systems @xcite have demonstrated that for some conditions the vacf decays _ slightly but definitely _",
    "faster than @xmath11 , in contradiction with the early findings of alder and wainwright @xcite mentioned above .    besides analyzing the correlation functions we also check the limits of applicability of the simulations , which has been missed in some previous studies .",
    "it is noted that while nonequilibrium methods are generally more efficient in studies of transport phenomena , equilibrium simulations have the advantage of allowing a direct test for the existence of transport coefficients , as explained above . in cases when this test indicates that a valid transport coefficient does not exist , nonequilibrium simulations yield `` transport coefficients '' that may not be unique , in a way that they exhibit dependence on system size .",
    "the system studied here is strictly two - dimensional , and it is under equilibrium conditions unlike some experiments , which are driven - dissipative @xcite . using this assumption",
    "we integrate the newtonian equation of motion of the particles during the course of the simulation .",
    "we apply a rectangular cell with edge lengths @xmath39 , and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "pairwise yukawa interparticle forces are summed over a @xmath37-dependent cutoff radius ( also extending into the images of the primary computational cell ) , using the chaining mesh technique .",
    "no thermostat is used , the desired system temperature is set by rescaling the momenta of the particles in the initialization phase of the simulation that precedes the start of data collection .",
    "the main results of the simulations are the correlation functions @xmath14 , @xmath17 , and @xmath20 , defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gk1])-([eq : gk3 ] ) .",
    "in addition to these correlation functions , to detect diffusion we also calculate time series for the mean squared displacement of particles @xmath40 the msd has an advantage , as compared to the vacf , at high @xmath5 where oscillations in the vacf obscure its decay .",
    "diffusive motion is characterized by a constant time derivative of the msd .",
    "phase space coordinates of the particles allow the determination of the vacf and msd directly , while the time series needed to calculate the sacf and eacf are obtained from the phase space coordinates as @xcite : @xmath41 , \\label{eq : pxy}\\\\ j_{qx } = \\sum_{i=1}^n v_{ix } \\biggl [ \\frac{1}{2 } m   |{\\bf v}_i|^2 + \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{j \\neq i}^n \\phi(r_{ij } )   \\biggr ] \\nonumber \\\\ - \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j \\neq i}^n ( { \\bf r}_i \\cdot { \\bf v}_i ) \\frac{\\partial \\phi(r_{ij})}{\\partial r_{ij } } , \\label{eq : jx}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 .",
    "we normalize distances by the 2d wigner - seitz radius @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the areal density .    the first term on the right hand side of eq.([eq : pxy ] )",
    "is called the kinetic term , while the second term is the potential term , i.e. @xmath45 similarly , the energy current may be written as @xmath46 where the three ( kinetic , potential , and collision @xcite or virial @xcite ) terms correspond to the ones on the right hand side of eq.([eq : jx ] ) .",
    "( it is noted that some authors follow a different partitioning of the energy current . )",
    "the stress autocorrelation function ( sacf ) thus has the form @xmath47 the energy current autocorrelation function ( eacf ) may as well be decomposed as @xmath48    in calculating these correlation functions from simulation data , we use a common method of overlapping time segments .",
    "each overlapping time segment begins at a different initial time in the time series .",
    "we average the correlation functions over all the overlapping segments .",
    "this averaging serves the role of an ensemble average .",
    "it also serves to reduce the noise .    for the vacf , we are also able to average over all the particles in the system , and this greatly reduces the noise as compared to the sacf and eacf , which allow only averaging over the overlapping segments . for this reason , noise presents a greater challenge for the sacf and eacf than for the vacf .",
    "we repeat all the simulations several times ( the actual numbers will be given for the cases presented later ) , each with different initial conditions for the particle positions .",
    "we combine the results of these runs , yielding a mean value and an error bar for each data point in the time series for the autocorrelation function .",
    "here we define in detail our analysis methods for the long - time behavior of the three autocorrelation functions .",
    "our goal is to assess whether the functions decay faster than @xmath11 , so that their integrals will converge and the corresponding transport coefficient exists .",
    "this assessment has in the past relied to a great extent on qualitative inspections of the autocorrelation functions .",
    "the analysis methods described below include improvements to invoke more quantative criteria for this assessment . in the end",
    "we will answer the question of whether the transport coefficient exists along with a measure of our confidence in the conclusion .",
    "first , we choose the time range for our analysis .",
    "this is done by inspecting a plot of the correlation function @xmath49 on log - log scales , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : threecurves ] . we select a starting time and a stopping time .",
    "the starting time will be selected usually as a judgment of the time when the initial decay ends .",
    "this judgment is qualitative , which is a concern because we are attempting to reduce the role of qualitative judgments .",
    "therefore , we will bracket this time and produce our final results for two or three different starting times , to judge whether the slightly arbitrary choice of a starting time has much impact . in some cases , instead of a qualitative judgment of the initial decay , we will use a crossover of the separate terms contributing to the sacf or eacf to determine the starting time .",
    "we believe that in some previous simulations @xcite , a starting time was chosen too soon , so that the analysis included a great deal of the initial decay , so that the results should not be relied upon .",
    "it is only because we now use a larger simulation size , so that the sound peak occurs later , that we can detect that this problem occurred in previous simulations of a smaller size",
    ".    the stopping time will be the sound peak or a zero crossing , whichever comes first . in the example of fig .",
    "[ fig : threecurves ] , the analysis will stop at the sound peak for the vacf and eacf , but at a zero crossing for the sacf . to detect how sensitive our result is to the stopping time",
    ", we repeat all our calculations using @xmath50 of the zero crossing as stopping time .",
    "second , we fit the data between the starting and stopping times to a power - law decay , @xmath51 = \\alpha \\log ( t ) + { \\rm{intercept}}. \\label{eq : whatwefit}\\ ] ] to avoid introducing a bias by overemphasizing data at long times , before fitting we resample @xmath49 at times that are uniformly spaced when plotted with a logarithmic axis .",
    "our fit to eq .",
    "( [ eq : whatwefit ] ) uses a calculation of a @xmath52 surface .",
    "the surface is calculated in the parameter space of the slope @xmath53 and the intercept .",
    "this method requires error bars for each data point in @xmath49 .",
    "we produce these error bars by performing multiple simulations for the same conditions but different initial conditions , and calculating the mean and standard deviation of the mean for each data point in @xmath49 .",
    "an example of a @xmath52 surface is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chisquaresurf ] .",
    "the best fit is the minimum of the @xmath52 surface , yielding @xmath54 .",
    "the quality of the fit is evaluated by comparing the minimum @xmath52 to @xmath55 , which is considered a typical value for a moderately good fit . in order to perform further statistical analysis",
    "we require an uncertainty , or standard error , for the fit parameter @xmath53 .",
    "we estimate this uncertainty @xmath56 using the @xmath57 confidence interval in the @xmath52 surface , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chisquaresurf ] .      to complete our analysis , we use student s t - statistics to compare @xmath54 to @xmath58 .",
    "first , we compose a null hypothesis @xmath59 in other words , our null hypothesis @xmath60 is that the transport is anomalous . we calculate the @xmath61 value as @xmath62 next , we calculate the @xmath63value for a one - tailed test using a student s t - calculator .",
    "the @xmath63value is the probability of @xmath64 . finally , we determine a significance level , @xmath65 , to reject @xmath60 .",
    "thus , in the end we determine the significance level for a conclusion that the transport is anomalous .",
    "to explain this in physical terms , we are attempting to reject the null hypothesis that the transport coefficient does not exist , i.e. , to reject the idea that the transport is anomalous . if we find that the significance level for this test is very high , for example @xmath66 , we would be confident in saying that the transport coefficient exists",
    ". however , if the significance level is much lower , for example @xmath67 , we would be unable to conclude whether the transport coefficient exists .",
    "as always with student s t - statistics , the test of the null hypothesis works only one way .",
    "we contemplate whether we can reject @xmath60 , not the converse .",
    "thus , if we find a small @xmath63value such as 0.05 we will conclude that the transport is not anomalous , with a significance leve @xmath65 .",
    "if we instead find a large @xmath63value such as 0.40 , the test does not yield a quantitative conclusion but we can examine the correlation function graph qualitatively for indications that suggest the transport is anomalous .",
    "most of the correlation function data presented below are based on several independent simulation runs , each with 1.1 @xmath68 time steps ( typically spanning a time several times @xmath69 ) , carried out on systems of @xmath70 = 4080 or 16  320 particles . after preparing the correlation functions , when we use the @xmath52 surface method , we limit the analysis to two cases .",
    "these are a cool liquid with @xmath32 and a warm liquid with @xmath71 , both for @xmath33 .",
    "these cases correspond to temperatures of @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively , using data for the melting point @xmath74 from @xcite .",
    "results for the @xmath52 surface and student s t - method are presented in tables  [ tab : vactable]-[tab : eacf ] .      to diagnose diffusive motion , we present the analysis of the velocity autocorrelation functions ( vacf ) in figs .  [",

    "this is preceded by initial decaying oscillations associated with caged motion , and it is followed by a sound peak ( marked @xmath75 ) and noisy oscillations . plotting the data on log - log axes reveals a power law , when the smooth decay appears to be a straight line . for reference",
    ", we draw a line with a slope of @xmath58 , corresponding to a @xmath36 decay .",

    "the fits with the best @xmath78 have a @xmath66 significance level . thus , our simulation indicates that the diffusion coefficient exists for this warm liquid . on the other hand , for a cold liquid , @xmath79",
    ", @xmath53 is very near to one , and we can not reject the null hypothesis @xmath60 of anomalous transport .    to further illustrate this trend of diffusive motion , we present in fig .  [",
    "fig : alpha](a ) fitting results for a range of @xmath5 .",
    "( for ease in performing repeated calculations , here we found @xmath53 using a simpler fitting method with only a single set of starting and stopping times , so that the results are less precise than in table  [ tab : vactable ] and do not have error bars or significance levels . )",

    "next we analyze the possible effects related to the finite size of the computational box .",
    "these effects are illustrated here for the vacf , but the limitations we find are also applicable to the other correlation functions , the sacf and the eacf .",
    "the finite size of the simulation box limits usefulness of simulation data in two different ways .",
    "first , particles may traverse a small simulation box without experiencing a sufficient number of collisions .",
    "this may be a concern only for low @xmath5 values .",

    "this can limit meaningful interpretation of correlation functions to @xmath84 .",
    "this is a concern especially at high @xmath5 , where correlations of caged particle motion @xcite , which appear as oscillations in the correlation function , persist a long time . for our purposes",
    "we wish to interpret correlation functions after these oscillations have decayed ; at high @xmath5 this requires a long time series and thus a large system size .",
    "the peaks marked @xmath75 in fig .",
    "[ fig : vac ] and are conspicuous indications of this effect .",
    "random particle motion can be decomposed into a spectrum of sound waves over a range of wavenumbers .",
    "the sound waves have a dispersion , where the group velocity depends on wavenumber , but this dispersion is significant only for large wavenumbers @xcite . for small wavenumbers",
    "the wave has little dispersion , so that there is a distinctive sound speed .",

    "= 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively , the sound speeds for such waves are @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding transit times are expected to be @xmath88 = 290 , 560 , and 950 , for @xmath37 = 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively , for a simulation box with edge length @xmath89 and @xmath70 = 16  320 particles .",

    "the effect of system size on the sound peak is demonstrated in fig  [ fig : sound](b ) .",
    "note that at the smallest system size ( @xmath70 = 1020 particles ) the part of the vacf with power law decay completely disappears .",
    "this shows that a large system size is essential , if one is to identify and fit the decay portion of the correlation function .",

    "the fit is not very reliable , as indicated by the wide error bar on this value , as well as a high value of @xmath78 in table  [ tab : eacf ] .",
    "we are thus unable to conclude whether the thermal conductivity exists for the cool liquid .",
    "improving this result would require more extensive computations to improve the signal - to - noise ratio in the eacf at long times .",
    "we now examine the separate contributions to the eacf in fig .",
    "[ fig : eacfterms ] . for @xmath71 , there is an apparent crossover of the kk and cc terms .",
    "this crossover may coincide with the end of the rather long initial decay that we judged in the total eacf of fig .",
    "[ fig : eacf ] . for @xmath32 ,",
    "on the other hand , there is no crossover , giving us more confidence in our analysis above based on the total eacf .",
    "our results here for the eacf are apparently the first that have been reported for a 2d yukawa liquid .",
    "we note that the eacf poses especially challenging computational requirements because the useful portion of the curve is at large @xmath61 when the signal - to - noise ratio is poorest .",
    "improving the signal - to - noise ratio for the eacf at @xmath5 = 300 to a level that would allow a conclusion would require at least an order of magnitude increase in runs beyond the 115 runs we used .",
    "we concluded that our simulation indicates the thermal conductivity coefficient does not exist for a warm liquid , but for a cool liquid , our signal - to - noise ratio did not allow a conclusion .",
    "it has long been suggested , for two - dimensional systems in general , that valid transport coefficients do not exist @xcite .",
    "here we reported some counter - examples , based on our calculations covering a wide range of parameters of 2d frictionless yukawa liquids .",
    "we find that transport coefficients sometimes exist , depending on the temperature :    * the diffusion coefficient exists for warm but not for cool liquids . for warm liquids ,",
    "the diffusion coefficient exists at temperatures higher than about five times the melting temperature . for cool liquids",
    ", however , we found a closely @xmath35 type decay of the velocity autocorrelation function ( vacf ) , indicating the occurence of anomalous diffusion and no valid diffusion coefficient .",
    "* the shear viscosity coefficient exists for cool but not warm liquids .",
    "this finding is contrary to previously reported results . for @xmath33 ,",
    "a cool liquid at @xmath32 exhibits a fast decay indicating a valid transport coefficient , but a warm liquid at @xmath71 does not . comparing to the result above",
    ", our simulations suggest that self - diffusion and viscosity do not couple , because the coefficients do not exist in the same temperature regimes .",
    "* the thermal conductivity , assessed here for the first time , does not exist for a warm liquid at @xmath71 , where a slow power - law decay in the energy autocorrelation function ( eacf ) was observed .",
    "for a cool liquid at @xmath32 , however , we are unable to come to a conclusion because of the technical challenges posed by signal - to - noise ratios and a long initial decay .",
    "our approach has been to ask the question , does the transport coefficient exist ?",
    "using equilibrium md simulations , this question was addressed by computing autocorrelation functions , and examining their decay at long times .",
    "a rapid decay would indicate that the integral of the autocorrelation function converges , and the corresponding transport coefficient exists .",
    "for the results reported here , we have improved our statistical analysis methods for assessing whether the decay is faster than @xmath11 , as required for convergence .",
    "a limitation of equilibrium md methodology is that testing for convergence requires reliable measurements of correlation functions at times tending to infinity , while the simulations yield results over only a finite time .",
    "this finite time is limited by two challenges : signal - to - noise ratios ( which are especially important for the shear viscosity and thermal conductivity ) and sound peaks arising from periodic boundary conditions ( especially important for the diffusion coefficient ) . both of these problems have been improved here by using larger simulation sizes than in previous reports . for this paper",
    ", we consumed several years of cpu time , using typical personal computers .",
    "nevertheless , the simulation data did not allow us to draw definite conclusions regarding the existence of transport coefficients in cases when the decay of correlation functions was close to @xmath11 .",
    "future advances in computational power will allow larger simulation sizes .",
    "the increase in size that is needed is substantial , because of the square - root scaling of the sound peak time with respect to system size @xmath70 .",
    "a @xmath114 fold increase in computations would be required for a 100-fold increase in meaningful time .",
    "because of these limitations that are gradually being offset by improved computing power , conclusions like those we presented above ( i ) should be considered as a snapshot view of a developing effort to estimate whether transport coefficients exist in 2d yukawa liquids and ( ii ) may even change just like in the case of 2d hard disk system ( @xcite vs. @xcite ) .",
    "our results are , nevertheless , valuable because of interest in 2d liquids in general , and also because of increased interest in transport measurements in 2d dusty plasma experiments .",
    "we can identify other areas where further work would be useful .",
    "higher temperature liquids , in the non - ideal gas phase , have not been well explored yet .",
    "systems present in 2d dusty plasma experiments  which include friction and particle heating @xcite , @xcite  can be simulated by md methods with proper modification of the particles equation of motion .",
