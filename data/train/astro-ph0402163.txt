    "grb980425 was the first gamma - ray burst ( grb ) to be identified with a supernova ( sn ) , sn1998bw @xcite .",
    "however , this association was not universally accepted since the spatial and temporal coincidence of these events could only be approximated to @xmath6 and @xmath72 d , respectively .",
    "recently , the detection of spectroscopic features in the light curve of grb030329 , similar to those seen in sn1998bw @xcite , has strengthened the hypothesis of the sn1998bw / grb980425 association .",
    "these results have given a powerful impetus to the `` collapsar '' model @xcite in which a wolf - rayet progenitor undergoes core collapse , producing a rapidly rotating black hole surrounded by an accretion disk which injects energy into the system and thus acts as a `` central engine '' .",
    "the energy extracted from this system supports a quasi - spherical type ibc sn explosion and drives collimated jets through the stellar rotation axis which produce the prompt gamma - ray and afterglow emission ( see review by @xcite ) .    despite this progress ,",
    "some unresolved issues remain .",
    "foremost among these is understanding the connection between local sne ibc and cosmological grbs .",
    "estimates of the fraction of type ibc sne that produce a grb range from @xmath8 @xcite , to 0.5% @xcite , and even approaching 100% @xcite .",
    "this uncertainty in the relative rates of ibc sne and grbs is due to different assumptions about the geometry and energetics of grbs .",
    "as the only local sn observed in association with a grb , sn1998bw is the key to our understanding . at a distance of 38 mpc , this type ic sn was unusually luminous at optical and radio wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the broad absorption lines seen in early spectra of sn1998bw implied expansion velocities of @xmath9 and ( isotropic ) kinetic energies of @xmath10 erg @xcite . likewise , the bright",
    ", early - peaked radio emission implied a significant amount of energy ( @xmath11 erg ) coupled to mildly ( @xmath12 ) relativistic ejecta @xcite .",
    "detailed modeling by @xcite confirmed this result and also showed the need for a second energy injection episode , indicating the presence of a central engine , similar to the model inferred for grbs .",
    "however , in contrast to the large energies inferred from the optical and radio emission from sn1998bw , grb980425 was a sub - energetic gamma - ray burst .",
    "the prompt emission had an ( isotropic ) energy release of only @xmath13 erg @xcite  4 to 6 orders of magnitude below typical grbs @xcite .",
    "one popular explanation posits that sn1998bw / grb980425 was a typical grb viewed away from the jet axis @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis can been described by two different scenarios based on the ratio of the off - axis angle , @xmath14 , to the opening angle of the grb jet , @xmath15 . in case 1 , @xmath16 so the jet emission is detected at early time . here ,",
    "the @xmath17-rays originate from the edge of the relativistic jet , causing the inferred ( isotropic ) energy to be suppressed @xcite . in case 2",
    ", @xmath14 is large ( @xmath18 @xmath15 ) so the jet emission is only detectable at late time ( @xmath19 years ) when the jet has reached spherical symmetry . in this case , the prompt @xmath17-ray emission may be due to compton scattering of photons into our line - of - sight @xcite .",
    "@xcite have investigated case 1 , finding the optical and @xmath17-ray emission to be consistent with an off - axis angle of @xmath20 ( for @xmath21 ) .",
    "this scenario , however , may have difficulty explaining the x - ray and radio evolution .",
    "@xcite has recently investigated case 2 , predicting a late - time rise in the observed luminosity which is most easily detectable at radio frequencies @xcite .",
    "the possibility of case 2 has given rise to unification models which imply some fraction of local ibc sne can also be described as grbs viewed off - axis @xcite .",
    "while the off - axis jet model provides a convenient framework in which to unite the grb and sn phenomena , confirmation of the model requires observational evidence for a grb jet within a local sn . in this paper",
    "we carry out late - time radio observations of sn1998bw in an effort to detect the putative off - axis jet from grb980425 .",
    "we combine this measurement with existing observations for a sample of nearby type ibc sne to place constraints on the parameters of the off - axis jet and the fraction of local ibc sne which could be associated with relativistic jets similar to those seen in cosmological grbs .",
    "we observed sn1998bw with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) beginning at 2003 december 4 21:00 ut and ending on 2003 december 5 8:30 ut .",
    "dual frequency observations were made at 1384 and 2368 mhz , using a bandwidth of 128 mhz and two orthogonal linear polarizations for each frequency band .",
    "the final synthesized beams were 8@xmath22 and 5@xmath23 , at 1384 and 2368 mhz , respectively .",
    "no emission is detected toward sn1998bw at either frequency but there is a weak source ( 209 @xmath24jy ) detected at 2368 mhz @xmath25 west and @xmath26 north of the sn .",
    "this source is too bright to be due to thermal emission from the complex of hii regions in this area .",
    "it is possible that this is the radio counterpart of the ultraluminous x - ray transient ( s1b ) recently identified by kouveliotou et al .",
    "( 2004 ) but it would be 60-times more luminous than the only other known detection @xcite . the peak flux density at the position of the sn was @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xmath24jy for 1384 and 2368 mhz , respectively .",
    "these new upper limits , taken 2049.19 d after grb980425 exploded ( @xmath295.6 yrs ) , lie just below the extrapolation of a power - law decay from 50 to 790 days ( figure  [ fig : lum_limits ] ) .",
    "@xcite has made predictions for the evolution of late - time radio emission from a typical grb jet viewed far from the jet axis .",
    "as the off - axis jet sweeps up material and decelerates , it eventually undergoes a dynamical transition to sub - relativistic expansion @xcite and spreads sideways into our line - of - sight .",
    "this occurs on a timescale @xmath30 years . here",
    "@xmath31 is the energy of the jet ( normalized to @xmath32 erg ) , @xmath33 is the velocity of the stellar wind , and @xmath34 is the mass loss rate of the progenitor star normalized as @xmath35 and equivalent to @xmath36 in the notation commonly used for grbs @xcite . on this same timescale",
    "the radio emission from the sn , which is produced by a spherical shock interacting with the circumstellar medium , will fade significantly with a power - law decay index of @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "particle acceleration within the jet produces bright synchrotron emission which causes a rapid rise of the radio luminosity as the jet comes into our line - of - sight . making the typical assumption that the energy is partitioned between the electrons and the magnetic field , and that these fractions ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) are constant throughout the evolution of the jet , the spectral luminosity is given by @xcite as :    @xmath40    on timescales @xmath41 the spectral luminosity of",
    "the jet rises steeply as @xmath42 @xcite and during @xmath43 it decays as @xmath44 , assuming an electron spectral index @xmath45 . as indicated by eqn 1 , an off - axis grb jet is most easily detected at radio frequencies .",
    "late - time radio observations of sn1998bw can therefore be used to impose constraints on the parameter space for an associated off - axis grb jet . in modeling the evolution of the putative jet emission , we consider four model parameters , @xmath31 , @xmath34 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , for which we adopt values comparable to those inferred for for cosmological grbs .",
    "the kinetic energy of the jet and the energy fraction in electrons are fairly well constrained by broadband observations of grb afterglows , so we assume typical values for these parameters of @xmath46 and @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the energy fraction in magnetic fields is significantly less constrained , however , showing a typical range of values between @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "this range imposes a significant uncertainty in the luminosity of an off - axis jet , through eqn 1 .",
    "the model is also strongly dependent on the mass loss rate of the progenitor  generally believed to be a massive wolf - rayet ( wr ) star .",
    "mass loss rates inferred from broadband modeling of grbs are typically @xmath49 @xcite , yet local wr stars have observed mass loss rates significantly larger , on the order of @xmath50 @xcite . the uncertainty associated with the progenitor mass loss rate maps to a large range in the predicted peak time and luminosity of an off - axis jet .",
    "thus the uncertainty in @xmath34 and @xmath39 produces a degeneracy in the model which we are able to constrain using late - time radio observations of local ibc sne .",
    "figure  [ fig : lum_limits ] shows the predicted radio luminosity evolution of an off - axis grb jet based on eqn 1 and using values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "this plot demonstrates how the uncertainty in @xmath39 produces a family of lightcurves for each @xmath34 value .",
    "the full set of constraints is derived through investigation of the two - dimensional parameter space of @xmath51 .",
    "figure  [ fig : sn98bw ] shows how the predicted spectral luminosity of the putative jet at time , @xmath54 , maps to a single contour in this parameter space . by comparing the observed luminosity of sn1998bw at each epoch with",
    "the jet luminosity predicted for that time , we exclude the region of parameter space _ rightward _ of the corresponding contour since this region produces a jet which is _ brighter _ than the observed sn1998bw emission at that epoch .",
    "the region of reasonable parameter space for the putative jet is bracketed by @xmath55 as derived from modeling of sn1998bw radio light curves @xcite for fitting the rise of the radio light curves , while @xcite prefers @xmath56 for fitting the x - ray light - curve decay . ] , and by @xmath57 as inferred for most cosmological grbs .",
    "the summed constraints ( from @xmath58 to @xmath59 days ) rule out the majority of this region .",
    "the search for an off - axis jet can similarly be carried out toward other local ( @xmath60 mpc ) type ibc sne for which there are late - time ( @xmath61 year ) radio observations .",
    "eight type ibc sne were taken from @xcite : seven upper limits ( sn2001b , sn2001ci , sn2001ef , sn2001ej , sn2001is , sn2002j , sn2002bm ) , and a detection ( sn 2002ap ) at @xmath62 years .",
    "we have supplemented this sample with very large array archival observations of sn1983n , sn1984l , sn1985f , sn1990b , sn1994i , and sn1997x taken at @xmath63 and @xmath64 years , respectively .",
    "in addition , we include the recent detection of sn2001em at @xmath65 years @xcite  the only sn within this sample for which there are no early time radio observations .",
    "the sne data are plotted in figure  [ fig : lum_limits ] . with the exception of sn2001em ,",
    "all of the late - time observations are significantly fainter than the @xmath66 off - axis jet prediction and nine sne constrain @xmath67 .    using the same method applied in  [ sec : sn98bw ] , we derive constraints for these 15 sne .",
    "the resulting contours are plotted with sn1998bw in figure  [ fig : mdot_epsb ] .",
    "for sne with later observations , the constraints on @xmath39 values improve , as demonstrated by the contours for sn1994i and sn1983n .",
    "the more robust constraints are provided by the faintest luminosity limits given by the nearest type ic supernovae , sn1994i , sn2002ap , sn1983n and sn1985f , all at @xmath68 mpc .",
    "additional constraints are derived from the sne for which we detect late - time emission , sn1994i and sn2002ap years due to an off - axis jet .",
    "however , this prediction assumes @xmath69 whereas lower values could delay the onset of re - brightening . ] , since they show evidence that the radio luminosity is decaying with respect to earlier lightcurve measurements ( see @xcite ) and are thus inconsistent with _ rising _ off - axis jet emission .",
    "the region of reasonable parameter space for an off - axis jet is roughly bracketed by @xmath70 and @xmath57 as typically inferred from broadband modeling of cosmological grbs @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : mdot_epsb ] shows that four of the sne ( 1994i , 1985f , 1997x , 1990b ) have contours that independently rule out this entire parameter space while eleven place significant constraints .",
    "the late - time radio emission of sn2001em is consistent with a typical grb jet only if the mass loss rate is @xmath71 ( for @xmath72 )",
    ". continued radio monitoring of sn2001em will reveal the origin of the emission , which may simply result from a late peaking radio sn within a dense circumstellar medium @xcite .",
    "late - time observations of sn1998bw ( @xmath295.6 yrs ) have allowed us to test the hypothesis that grb980425 was a standard grb viewed far away from the jet axis .",
    "our measured upper limits at 1384 and 2368 mhz are consistent with the continued power - law decay of the sn emission .",
    "these limits imply an off - axis jet is only plausible if the normalized mass loss rate of the progenitor star is @xmath73 ( for @xmath74 ) .",
    "this is @xmath75 times smaller than the observed mass loss rates for local wolf - rayet stars @xcite and is below the range typically observed in grbs .",
    "larger mass loss rates are possible but only if the energy fraction in magnetic fields is low ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath5 ) .",
    "even tighter constraints are derived for the off - axis jet model when we examine a larger sample of local ibc sne .",
    "the low luminosity limits derived for this sample require values of @xmath76 or @xmath77 which are below values for typical grbs . the absence of any late - time radio emission can therefore be used to put a limit on the fraction of core - collapse sne that produce collimated , relativistic outflows .",
    "our results imply that off - axis jets from nearby sne are rare ( @xmath786% ) with the possible exception that the radio emission from sn2001em is due to a grb jet .",
    "this conclusion complements the findings of @xcite who constrained the grb / sn fraction through a radio survey of local ibc sne at early time .",
    "@xcite used early , bright radio emission as a proxy for relativistic ejecta , as in the case for sn1998bw . after studying 33 local sne with detection limits @xmath79 times fainter than sn1998bw",
    ", @xcite found no evidence for relativistic ejecta in any of the sne observed , thereby constraining the grb / sn fraction to @xmath80 .",
    "taken together , these results support a view that sn1998bw was a rare and unusually energetic sn ",
    "distinct from local sne and grbs . in this scenario ,",
    "the characteristics of sn1998bw / grb980425 are not dictated by the observer s viewing angle , but rather by the properties of its central engine .",
    "sn1998bw was an engine - driven explosion @xcite , in which 99.5% of the kinetic energy ( @xmath11 erg ) was coupled to mildly ( @xmath12 ) relativistic ejecta @xcite , while a mere 0.5% was detected in the ultra - relativistic ( @xmath81 ) flow .",
    "in contrast , grbs couple most of their energy to relativistic @xmath17-rays . the observed diversity of cosmic explosions ( sne , x - ray flashes , and grbs ) may therefore be explained with a standard energy yield , but with a varying fraction of that energy given to relativistic ejecta @xcite ."
