    "nuclear matter under extreme conditions provides ample challenges to our understanding of the mechanism of confinement based on microscopic quantum - chromo dynamics .",
    "strong fluctuations , be it at the high temperatures that existed shortly after the big bang or at the high densities in the interior of neutron stars , lead to an emergence of partonic degrees of freedom , confined in hadrons at everyday energy scales . with the advent of modern collider facilities , such as rhic and lhc , as well as future facilities , such as fair , it is possible to recreate these scenarios directly in the laboratory .    to gain quantitative insight into the dynamical aspects of deconfinement , the bound states of a heavy quark and antiquark are ideal probes @xcite .",
    "the ground states of these two - body systems in vacuum possess lifetimes of the order of inverse kev @xcite , which makes them essentially stable from the point of view of qcd .",
    "if immersed in a thermal bath they are thus able to accumulate effects from the medium over time , while still remaining well defined particles that can be cleanly measured in experiment . eventually , as temperature is increased",
    ", they will melt into their constituents .",
    "how and over which timescales this melting occurs , has been and remains the focus of a wealth of theoretical studies ( for a selection of lattice qcd based studies to in - medium modification of heavy quarkonium see @xcite ) .",
    "a first principles understanding of the melting process in turn opens up the possibility to extract from the measured yields in relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite the properties of the medium created in the collision center .",
    "this essentially would turn heavy quarkonium into a dynamical thermometer for rhic and lhc . while the classic idea of a suppression of yields in the presence of a qgp @xcite invigorated this area of research , we now know that an intricate interplay between melting and regeneration @xcite , needs to be understood before quantitative predictions can be made .",
    "what distinguishes heavy quarkonium , such as e.g. bottomonium ( the @xmath7 vector channel ) , from lighter mesons is the inherent separation of scales between the constituent quark mass and the medium temperature , as well as the characteristic scale of qcd ( @xmath8 ) . from the rough estimates for the initial temperature based on direct photons at rhic ( @xmath9mev ) @xcite and lhc ( @xmath10mev )",
    "@xcite we see that indeed @xmath11 .",
    "intuitively this tells us that under the conditions of current heavy - ion experiments , neither quantum nor thermal fluctuations can spontaneously create a heavy quark pair , so that a description in terms of non - relativistic physics should be feasible .",
    "note that these temperatures are still close to the deconfinement temperature @xmath12mev as determined from lattice qcd @xcite and hence the medium partons remain strongly interacting .",
    "using effective field theories ( eft ) @xcite it has been shown that the effects of the interactions between a static quark - antiquark pair and a thermal medium can be summarized in a schrdinger equation with an effective in - medium potential .",
    "the derivation of the potential relies on a matching procedure to fundamental qcd , and relates its values to the late real - time behavior of the rectangular wilson loop @xmath13 \\right\\rangle .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a first evaluation of this quantity in hard - thermal loop perturbation theory @xcite showed that the potential at finite temperature is complex valued .",
    "as expected at temperatures far above @xmath14 , the presence of deconfined partons leads to debye screening of the real part .",
    "the imaginary part on the other hand has been attributed to landau damping ( scattering with medium gluons ) @xcite and a subsequent systematic eft analysis revealed @xcite additional contributions from the transition of a singlet to an octet state ( absorption of medium gluons ) .    before the advent of a modern effective field theory for in - medium",
    "heavy quarkonium , the temperature dependence of the real - part of the static inter - quark potential has often been modeled in phenomenological studies . some studies used the color singlet free energies @xmath15 others the internal energies @xmath16 or even linear combinations thereof @xcite .",
    "interestingly , resummed htl perturbation theory to leading order tells us that @xmath17 $ ] and @xmath18 agree but this relation already appears to break down at next to leading order @xcite . to provide phenomenology with dependable input , the question of how to evaluate eq",
    ". in a non - perturbative manner becomes a pressing issue .",
    "simulations of lattice qcd provide us with non - perturbative access to the static properties of qcd at finite temperature , e.g. the equation of state @xcite .",
    "these calculations are carried out in euclidean time , so that real - time quantities , such as the wilson loop @xmath19 , are not directly accessible .",
    "this challenge has spurred remarkable progress over the last two years , both in terms of concepts and methods , moving us towards a reliable evaluation of eq .",
    "on the lattice .",
    "one of the central ingredients , acting as bridge between the euclidean and minkowski domain , is the following spectral decomposition @xcite @xmath20 substituted into the definition eq .",
    ", it relates the values of the potential to the real and positive definite spectral function @xmath21 @xmath22    we face two challenges when trying to obtain the values of the potential in practice .",
    "one is related to the fact that extracting the continuous function @xmath21 from a finite and noisy set of lattice datapoints @xmath23 is an inherently ill - defined problem .",
    "indeed a simple @xmath24 fit would lead to an infinite set of degenerate spectra that all reproduce the datapoints within their error bars . in order to give meaning to such a task , we turn to the concept of bayesian inference , an approach well established in mathematical statistics .",
    "it provides the formal framework to incorporate additional , so called prior information , such as the positivity of @xmath21 or smoothness properties , in order to regularize an otherwise under - determined @xmath24 fit . for our study",
    "we deploy a recently developed bayesian prescription to spectral function reconstruction @xcite , which has been shown in mock data studies to give better accuracy and precision than both the conventional maximum entropy method @xcite , as well as the implementation with extended search space @xcite .    carrying out the late time limit in eq .",
    "represents the second challenge .",
    "simply inserting the reconstructed spectrum is impractical , as the numerical @xmath25 limit requires a precision of @xmath21 currently not obtainable .",
    "instead @xcite proposed that , since the dynamics of the wilson loop at late times will eventually be dominated by the lowest lying peak in @xmath21 , its functional form should be fitted from the lattice spectra .",
    "the fourier transform of eq . can subsequently be carried out analytically without difficulty .",
    "the question of which functional form to use in such a fit however remained and was only answered later in @xcite , where the effects of different time - scales contributing to @xmath21 were disentangled . based on the symmetries of the wilson loop",
    "it was shown in a general argument that the lowest lying peak will take the form of a skewed lorentzian : @xmath26-({\\rm re}v(r)-\\omega){\\rm sin}[{\\rm re } { \\sigma_\\infty}(r ) ] } { { \\rm i m } v(r)^2 + ( { \\rm re } v(r)-\\omega)^2}+{c_0}(r)+{c_1}(r)({\\rm re } v(r)-\\omega)+\\ldots\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : skewlor}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the fitted position thus corresponds to the real part of the potential , the fitted width to the imaginary part . taking",
    "the skewness of the lorentzian peak into account is crucial , as otherwise e.g. the peak position is systematically overestimated .",
    "the viability of this strategy , sketched in fig.[fig1 ] , to access the static potential from euclidean correlator data has been successfully tested in @xcite using htl resummed perturbation theory . at the same time indications",
    "were found that for the sole purpose of determining the potential , one can replace the wilson loop with the correlator of wilson lines @xmath27 in coulomb gauge .",
    "the latter is devoid of the cusp divergences of the wilson loop ( see @xcite and references therein ) and hence is much easier to measure on the lattice .",
    "these conceptual and technical improvements combined , allow us to reliably extract the temperature dependence of the static inter - quark potential from quenched and dynamical lattice qcd .",
    "besides presenting our main results @xcite we show explicitly the default model dependence of the reconstructions .",
    "( for plots of the effects of a removal of datapoints along @xmath28 see @xcite ) .",

    "the reason is practicability , since the relatively low cost of quenched lattice qcd simulations allows us to use lattices with a temporal extend larger than @xmath32 .",
    "this is a prerequisite for the reliable determination of spectral peak positions ( re[v ] ) , as well as for a robust order of magnitude estimate of the spectral width , i.e. im[v ] , in the presence of our fine lattice spacing .",

    "each configuration is fixed to coulomb gauge iteratively before the wilson line correlators are measured along each spatial axis , on the square- as well as on the cubic diagonals .",
    "we correct for some of the lattice spacing artifacts in the spatial distances by comparing the behavior of free propagators on the lattice to that in the continuum , as described in @xcite .    with the euclidean wilson lines at hand , we carry out the spectral reconstruction using all datapoints except those at @xmath40 , to avoid possible overlap divergences @xcite .",

    "the spectral determination of re[v ] at temperatures around the phase transition shows much less variation compared to the free energies , since it does not only rely on information at @xmath56 but takes into account multiple datapoints along @xmath28 . from the fit of the spectral width we find that im[v ] takes on values that are of the same order of magnitude as those predicted by htl resummed perturbation theory",

    "fitting the position and width of these spectra , we determined the real and imaginary part in quenched qcd and re[v ] on realistic dynamical lattices with light u , d and s quarks .",
    "we find a gradual transition of the linear confining behavior to a debye screened form in re[v ] and observe that its values lie close to those of the color singlet free energies in coulomb gauge .",
    "our estimate for the imaginary part on quenched lattices takes on the same order of magnitude as the predictions from htl resummed perturbation theory .",
    "we furthermore checked the systematic dependencies of the bayesian reconstruction including various default models .",
    "the spectra at @xmath96 are very stable , while the decrease in physical extend or in the number of points in euclidean time at higher temperatures degrades the outcome at separation distances @xmath59fm , as expected .",

    "<S> we report recent results of a non - perturbative determination of the static heavy - quark potential in quenched and dynamical lattice qcd at finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the real and imaginary part of this complex quantity are extracted from the spectral function of wilson line correlators in coulomb gauge . to obtain spectral information from euclidean time numerical data , </S>",
    "<S> our study relies on a novel bayesian prescription that differs from the maximum entropy method . </S>",
    "<S> we perform simulations on quenched @xmath0 @xmath1 lattices with @xmath2 , which cover @xmath3 . to investigate the potential in a quark - gluon plasma with light u , d and s quarks we utilize @xmath4 asqtad lattices with @xmath5 by the hotqcd collaboration , giving access to temperatures between @xmath6 . the real part of the potential exhibits a clean transition from a linear , confining behavior in the hadronic phase to a debye screened form above deconfinement . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly its values lie close to the color singlet free energies in coulomb gauge at all temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the imaginary part on quenched lattices and find that it is of the same order of magnitude as in hard - thermal loop perturbation theory . from among all the systematic checks carried out in our study , we discuss explicitly the dependence of the result on the default model and the number of datapoints .     </S>",
