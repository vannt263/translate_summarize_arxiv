    "the primary purpose of the heavy ion programme at the cern sps is the search for a transient deconfined state of strongly interacting matter during the early stage of nucleus  nucleus collisions @xcite .",
    "when a sufficiently high initial energy density is reached , the formation of such a state of quasi free quarks and gluons , the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , is expected .",
    "a key problem is the identification of experimental signatures of qgp creation @xcite .",
    "numerous proposals were discussed in the past @xcite , but the significance of these signals has come under renewed scrutiny . a possible , promising strategy is a study of the energy dependence of pion and strangeness yields .",
    "it was suggested @xcite that the transition may lead to anomalies in this dependence : a steepening of the increase of the pion yield and a non monotonic behaviour of the strangeness to pion ratio .",
    "the space  time evolution of the created fireball @xcite and the event  by  event fluctuations @xcite may also be sensitive to crossing the transition region .",
    "first experimental results from pb+pb ( au+au ) collisions at top sps ( 158 @xmath0gev ) and ags ( 11 @xmath0gev ) energies have suggested @xcite that anomalies in pion and strangeness production may be located between these energies .",

    "this allows separation of positively and negatively charged tracks and a precise measurement of the particle momenta @xmath27 with a resolution of @xmath28 ( gev / c)@xmath29 .",
    "the other two tpcs ( mtpc - l and mtpc - r ) , positioned downstream of the magnets were optimised for high precision measurement of the ionization energy loss @xmath30 ( relative resolution of about 4% ) which provides a means of determining the particle mass .",
    "the particle identification capability of the mtpcs is augmented by two time of flight ( tof ) detector arrays with a resolution @xmath31 60 ps .",

    "data were taken for both field polarities .",
    "the target , a thin lead foil ( 224 mg/@xmath36 @xmath371% of the interaction length ) , was positioned about 80 cm upstream from vtpc-1 .",
    "central collisions were selected by a trigger using information from a downstream calorimeter ( vcal ) , which measured the energy of the projectile spectator nucleons .",
    "the geometrical acceptance of the vcal calorimeter was adjusted for each energy in order to cover the projectile spectator region by a proper setting of a collimator ( coll )  @xcite .",
    "raw @xmath3 and @xmath38 yields were extracted from fits of the distributions of @xmath30 and @xmath39 ( where available ) in narrow bins of momentum and transverse momentum .",
    "the spectra at midrapidity are obtained using the combined @xmath30 and @xmath39 information ( @xmath40 analysis ) .",

    "the contamination of @xmath38 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 from the interaction vertex as well as non  vertex hadrons originating from strange particle decays and secondary interactions was subtracted using two different methods .    in the first method",
    "each track measured in the tpcs was extrapolated back to the target plane .",
    "the distance between the track and the interaction vertex was calculated in this plane ( track impact parameter ) .",
    "the impact parameter distributions were used to establish cuts for selection of tracks from the interaction vertex and to estimate the contribution of remaining non ",
    "vertex tracks . a correction for @xmath38 contamination",
    "was calculated using parametrised @xmath38 spectra .    in the second method",
    "all tracks fitted to the interaction vertex were accepted .",
    "the necessary corrections were calculated based on a venus @xcite simulation of central pb+pb collisions .",
    "the venus events were processed by geant @xcite and the na49 software which simulates the tpc response and produces files in raw data format .",
    "these events were reconstructed and the reconstructed tracks were matched to the venus input .",
    "the obtained correction was scaled by a factor which matches the simulated venus and the measured hadron yields .",
    "the corrections determined using both methods are compatible .",
    "the venus based correction , amounting to 2025% , is used for the data presented in this paper .",
    "the @xmath4 spectra were not analysed , because the positive particles have a large and uncertain contribution of protons .",
    "the resulting @xmath45 and @xmath41 spectra were corrected for geometrical acceptance , and losses due to inefficiencies of the tracking algorithms and quality cuts .",
    "these losses were determined using the ` embedding ' method .",
    "events containing a few tracks were generated and processed by the simulation software .",
    "the resulting raw data were embedded into real events .",
    "the combined raw data were reconstructed and the input tracks were matched with the reconstructed ones .",
    "the calculated losses are about  5% .    in order to reduce the systematic errors ,",
    "the analysis has been restricted to regions of phase space where the background and efficiency corrections are small and approximately uniform .",
    "the systematic errors were estimated to be below 10% .",
    "this estimate is based on the comparison of results obtained using different detectors ( tof , tpcs ) , and varying cuts and correction strategies ( see above ) .",
    "additionally , data taken at the two magnetic field polarities were analysed and the results were found to agree within 5% .",

    "the average number of wounded nucleons @xcite @xmath46 ( the notation @xmath47 will be used to denote the mean multiplicity in full phase space throughout the paper ) as given in table  i was not directly measured but was calculated using the fritiof model @xcite . in an unbiased sample of generated inelastic interactions a subsample of central events was selected by applying a cut in the number of projectile spectators .",
    "this cut was adjusted such that the selected fraction was equal to the fraction of all inelastic interactions accepted by the central trigger in the experiment .",

    "it was suggested @xcite that a transition to a deconfined state of matter may cause anomalies in the energy dependence of pion and strangeness production .",

    "this is , in fact , observed in the data on central pb+pb ( au+au ) collisions , where the steepening starts in the range 1540  @xmath0gev ( see fig .  [ energy ] ) .",
    "the linear dependence on @xmath72 is obeyed by the data at lower and higher energies ( including rhic ) .",
    "an increase of the slope by a factor of about 1.3 is measured ( see sect .",

    "the strangeness to entropy ratio steeply increases with collision energy , due to the low temperature at the early stage ( @xmath106 ) and the high mass of the carriers of strangeness ( @xmath107 mev , the kaon mass ) in the confined state . when the transition to a qgp is crossed ( @xmath108 ) , the mass of the strangeness carriers is significantly reduced ( @xmath109 mev , the strange quark mass ) . due to the low mass ( @xmath110 ) the strangeness yield becomes ( approximately ) proportional to the entropy , and the strangeness",
    "to entropy ( or pion ) ratio is independent of energy .",

    "the simplest one is the statistical hadron gas model @xcite where independent of the collision energy the hadrochemical freeze  out creates a hadron gas in equilibrium @xcite . the temperature , baryon chemical potential and hadronization volume are free parameters of the model , which are fitted to the data at each energy . in this formulation",
    ", the hadron gas model does not predict the energy dependence of hadron production . recently",

    "it is seen that rqmd , like the hadron gas model , fails to describe the decrease of the @xmath100 ratio in the sps energy range .",
