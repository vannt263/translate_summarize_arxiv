    "proper motions , along with precise distances and radial velocities , of stars in the milky way are an important piece of observational information .",
    "in particular , they are indispensable in building the six - dimensional phase space of these stars , which in turn provides vital information to understand the kinematics of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "several comprehensive proper motion catalogs have been released over the previous decade , which have improved the depth and accuracy each time .",
    "the ppmx catalog @xcite includes proper motions with a typical precision of @xmath9mas@xmath1for 18 million stars , down to a limiting magnitude of @xmath10 in r - band .",
    "the ppmxl catalog @xcite uses a combination of the united states naval observatory b data ( usno - b1.0 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) astrometry .",
    "it includes objects to a magnitude of @xmath11 , providing @xmath8 900 million proper motions across the entire sky , calibrated to the international celestial reference system ( icrs ) ; the typical individual proper motions uncertainties range from 4 mas@xmath1  to more than 10 mas@xmath1 , depending on observational history .",
    "@xcite made a global correction to the proper motions in ppmxl , taking care of the fact that extragalactic sources seem to originally have non - zero proper motions in ppmxl .",
    "@xcite updated the ucac series @xcite and published the latest release ucac4 .",
    "this catalog contains over 113 million objects covering the entire sky , of which 105 million have proper motions complete down to about @xmath12 mag .",
    "based on the tycho - gaia astrometric solution ( tgas ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the first data release of gaia ( gaia dr1 ) published a catalog with proper motions in september 2016 for about 2 million tycho-2 stars which only reach @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "eventually , gaia s proper motion measurements for more than a billion stars ( @xmath14 ) in our galaxy @xcite will reach a level of 5 - 25 @xmath15as for @xmath16 stars , superseding all the previous ground - based measurements .",
    "while gaia dr1 contained proper motions for only 2 million tgas stars , it also released precise j2015.0 positions for @xmath17 billion stars across the entire sky @xcite . for 90% of stars",
    "brighter than 19 mag , the positional accuracies are better than 13.7 mas , half of them are better than 1.5 mas , and some even reach 0.1 mas .    through more than five years of surveying , pan - starrs1 ( ps1 ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has collected imaging data for billions of stars with high accuracy and multi - detections ( @xmath18 on average ) for each source .",
    "the average uncertainty in positions is up to @xmath19 mas for stars brighter than 19 mag in r - band .    here",
    "we set out to combine gaia dr1 s one - epoch position at extremely high precision , with multi - epoch astrometry that ps1 survey provides , along with positions from sdss and 2mass at earlier epochs .",
    "this provides an unprecedented opportunity to build the best current proper motions catalog across much of the sky .    in general ,",
    "two basic approaches can be used to bring proper motions to an inertial frame : either use a highly accurate catalog that is already tied to the icrs system , such as hipparcos , and add fainter sources to this system , as done for the tycho-2 @xcite , ppmxl @xcite , and ucac4 @xcite catalogs ; or build a reference frame from distant extragalactic sources like galaxies ( whose proper motions must be negligible ) , and cross - calibrate different epochs so that these sources have no proper motion .",
    "the proper motion catalog for sdss @xcite and the xpm catalog @xcite were built using the latter method .    in this paper",
    ", we follow the second approach , and combine data from ps1 , gaia dr1 , sdss and 2mass to obtain a catalog of proper motions dubbed gps1 .",
    "gps1 is currently unmatched in its combination of depth , precision and accuracy among catalogs that cover major portion of the sky . in section 2 ,",
    "we detail the data sets involved . in section 3",
    ", we lay out the approach for deriving reliable proper motions of stars from these surveys .",
    "we present our results , illustrating different data combinations , in section 4 , where we also validate the precision and accuracy of these proper motions with open clusters and distant halo stars , and compare with published catalogs .",
    "we discuss possible problems that may induce small biases in proper motion estimates in section 5 .",
    "we conclude in section 6 .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we adopt the solar motion as @xmath20km@xmath21  @xcite , and the iau circular speed of the local standard of rest ( lsr ) as @xmath22km@xmath21 .",
    "also , @xmath23 is used to denote the right ascension in the gnomonic projection coordinate system , for example , @xmath24  @xmath25 @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , while @xmath28 denotes uncertainties , to avoid confusion with the symbol @xmath29 referring to a source s declination",
    ". we use @xmath30 to denote the differences in quantities such as proper motion or position .",
    "in order to construct proper motions , we analyze and model _ catalog positions _ from four different imaging surveys , which we now discuss .",
    "gaia dr1 is based on observations collected between july 25 , 2014 and september 16 , 2015 .",
    "ps1 observations were collected between 2010 and 2014 .",
    "the sdss dr9 data used here were obtained in the years between 2000 and 2008 . the images from 2mass were taken between 1997 and 2001 .",
    "the characteristics of the four astrometric catalogs are summarized in table [ tab : surveys ] .",
    ".[tab : surveys ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +",
    "for the most part , gps1 should constitute a catalog that is far more accurate and considerably more precise than existing catalogs of comparable size and depth , ppmxl and ucac4 . here",
    ", we discuss a number of regimes , where gps1 has limitations beyond its main uncertainties , and where it should be used with great caution .",
    "the reference frame calibration across the different surveys is difficult in crowded regions , for example near globular clusters or in the galactic plane ( @xmath31 ) , for two reasons : on the one hand , source crowding ( the different surveys differ by a factor of @xmath32 in resolution ) may lead to systematic errors in source centering . on the other hand , blended sources may be classified erroneously as extended sources ( an important criterion in ps1 s star - galaxy separation ) ; if that happens too often in crowded regions , the mean proper motion of the stellar sample may inevitably be driven towards zero by our calibration approach .    to explore these effects ,",
    "we calibrated a sample of stars near the globular cluster m13 , with two variants of bringing different epochs to the same reference frame : in one case we include objects classifies as galaxies in the core radius ; in the other , we do not . for these two cases ,",
    "the final proper motions of stars close to the core region are significantly different .",
    "this indicates that misclassification of galaxies in a crowded core causes poor reference frame calibration .    in order to reduce the impacts of crowding in sources on positional calibration",
    ", we simply do not use the galaxies from the core radius of globular clusters , but only the bright galaxies in the galactic plane to build a relatively reliable reference with ps1 for this study . in a future paper ,",
    "( _ in preparation _ )",
    "we plan a more careful calibration for stars in crowded regions with the aim of measuring proper motions for thousands of known star clusters and search for new star cluster candidates using the gps1 catalog .",
    "refraction of the earth s atmosphere varies with airmass and colors , called differential chromatic refraction ( dcr ) .",
    "airmass is related to the azimuth of a celestial object .",
    "azimuth depends on declination , right ascension , and other conditions , such as observational time and location of observatory . for a ground - based telescope ,",
    "most observations are near meridian , so declination becomes a rough proxy for airmass .",
    "the wide emission lines and large redshifts make qsos present complex dcr effect @xcite . moreover , gaia , ps1 and sdss surveys were conducted with different conditions : gaia is a space - based telescope , the observations are impervious to the impact of dcr ; while ps1 and sdss are ground - based telescopes and located in the different places , so the two surveys suffer from drc with different extent .",
    "the combination of the multi surveys in proper motions fit also will complicates the impacts of dcr . in order to figure out how the dcr affects the proper motions , we choose three samples of qsos and stars in three declinations , and divide them into different magnitude bins .",
    "figure [ fig : dcr ] displays the magnitude and declination dependent impact of dcr on qsos in the left panel and on stars in the right panel . for qsos in the ps1 case , the observations near the meridian greatly reduce the impact of dcr on @xmath24  ( top - left , dashed lines ) . the deviation from zero ( dot black line )",
    "is only @xmath33mas@xmath1  in the low ( high ) declinations , particularly in the good number bins of faint qsos .",
    "however , the impact on @xmath34  is much more pronounced ( bottom - left , dashed lines ) , the deviation is @xmath35 @xmath36mas@xmath1  in the low ( high ) declination .",
    "the under ( over ) estimation of @xmath34  in the low ( high ) declination increases as moving towards the fainter regions . in the gps case ( solid lines ) ,",
    "whatever on the @xmath24  ( top - left ) or @xmath34  ( bottom - left ) , the impact of dcr turns to be worse .",
    "the under ( over ) estimation can be up to @xmath8 - 4.0 ( + 4.0)mas@xmath1  in the low ( high ) declination , but the trends of the deviation from zero are almost same as the case in ps1 .",
    "gaia and sdss detections , even if they were more `` correct '' than the ps1 measurements , apparently amplify the effect of dcr .    for stars we can still explore how the inclusion of gaia and sdss data affect the proper motion estimates , compared to ps1 only .",
    "we do this by analyzing the proper motion estimate differences , for example @xmath37 ( solid curves ) and @xmath38 ( dashed curves ) , shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : dcr ] .",
    "the difference between gps and ps1 is very small ( @xmath39mas@xmath1 , @xmath40mas@xmath1 ) for both @xmath24  ( top - right ) and @xmath34  ( bottom - right ) except in the bin of bright stars where the number of stars is small .",
    "it indicates that gaia and sdss do not amplify the dcr impacts on stars like qsos .",
    "the dashed lines demonstrate that the sdss detections change the inferred proper motions of ps1 significantly , especially at high declinations , the shifts on @xmath34  of ps1 caused by sdss detections ( bottom - right , red dashed curve ) are linear to the magnitudes , and the @xmath34  can be changed down to @xmath41mas@xmath1 .",
    "interestingly , gaia seems to recover this kind of significant shifts caused by sdss , as shown by the red solid curve in the bottom right panel .",
    "we also investigate the case of galaxies , but do not detect any significant impacts due to dcr .",
    "the median proper motions of galaxies are around 0.0 mas@xmath1  ( @xmath42mas@xmath1 ) , except at low declinations where they are non - zero ( @xmath43mas@xmath1 ) , as displayed in figure [ fig : dcr_gals ] .    in general , dcr generates complex and severe impacts on qsos .",
    "therefore , qsos are not ideal tracers to validate the proper motions in this context , as discussed in section [ sect : val_qso ] .",
    "however , dcr has more benign influences on stars and galaxies , so it is safe to use the proper motions in the gps1 catalog .      in section [ sec : mag_offset ] , we reported the positional offsets between the predicted , from ps1 , and the originally observed gaia positions .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : offset2 ] , the positional offsets of stars are significantly magnitude and declination dependent .",
    "the position can have an offset of up to @xmath44 mas .",
    "@xcite point out that the astrometry of ps1 is flux dependent and may be affected by imperfect dcr @xcite .",
    "due to charge leakage , bright stars have positional displacements on chips relative to faint stars .",
    "this leakage is more in the case of brighter stars .",
    "this effect was first identified by johannes koppenhffer in 2011 @xcite . the dcr is a typical declination dependent effect that arises due to variation of airmass in the direction of declination for observations near meridian",
    ". the combined impact of the two effects might induce spurious proper motions from ps1 , with which the predicted gaia positions could be magnitude and declination dependent .",
    "although these two systematic effects were corrected in @xcite , that correction may be imperfect .",
    "although the galaxy proper motions from ps1 are not exactly zero , they are @xmath43mas@xmath1  in the worst case , as depicted by the dashed curves in figure [ fig : dcr_gals ] . such proper motions can not induce up to @xmath45 mas positional offset in two years .",
    "all the detections from gaia are converted to j2015.0 , and the average epoch of ps1 is taken in the year @xmath8 2013 .",
    "it indicates that the offset might be partly related with the astrometry of gaia itself .",
    "we do not have enough evidence to definitively sort out the nature of these complex astrometric offsets . here , we restrict ourselves to assessing them .",
    "in section [ sect : method ] , we used cross - validation to remove the outliers in the proper motion fit . using this technique , we could also diagnose how the ps1 seasonavg positional uncertainties work as weight in the proper motion fit .",
    "we randomly choose around 2000 bright stars ( @xmath46 ) from ps1 and conduct this cross - validation .",
    "figure [ fig : ddec ] shows the histogram of the normalized residuals for the sample .",
    "these residuals are calculated by taking the difference between the observed seasonavg ps1 positions in a season , and the value predicted for that season by the proper motion fit where that particular season has been withheld .",
    "the residual was then normalized with the uncertainty in the ps1 seasonavg position .    ideally , the width of the histogram should be unity , which would indicate well - measured positions . the value of @xmath47 that we measure is not alarming , as tests on mock data have shown that the cross - validation systematically overestimates the uncertainty , when the number of data points in a proper motion fit is small ( @xmath48 points ) in the simulation .",
    "for example , even though the true astrometric uncertainty in a mock sample was set to 5 mas , the cross - validation probably returned the uncertainty of 7 mas .",
    "to conclude , it indicates the uncertainties of ps1 seasonavg positions are not significantly underestimated .",
    "the ps1 , gaia , sdss , and 2mass surveys have collected multi - detection positions for billions of stars , with precise relative astrometry across a baseline of @xmath49 years . by combining them , we build a catalog of proper motions for @xmath8 350 million stars across three quarters of the sky .",
    "this catalog reaches a magnitude of @xmath0mag , with a systematic error ( i.e. an accuracy ) of @xmath50 0.3 mas@xmath1 and a typical individual source precision of @xmath5mas@xmath1 .",
    "our analysis required that the cataloged source positions of all surveys , at all separate epochs , be brought to a common reference frame .",
    "we accomplished that with data - driven approaches by requiring either that galaxies have zero proper motions or that angular motions of stars on the sky are essentially linear .",
    "we verified that this approach leads to proper motion estimates of the precision and accuracy stated above .",
    "there are several important exceptions that we discuss , in particular qsos and crowded fields .",
    "we compare gps1 with published large scale proper motion catalogs in section [ sect : val_pal5 ] : the accuracy of gps1 ( @xmath3 mas@xmath1 ) is @xmath8 10 times better than ppmxl and ucac4 ( @xmath4 mas@xmath1 ) , and the precision ( @xmath5 mas@xmath1 ) is @xmath8 4 times better than ppmxl and ucac4 ( @xmath6 mas@xmath1 ) .",
