    "the origin of magnetic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) in single - molecule magnets ( smms ) is important for fundamental reasons as well as proposed applications , ranging from magnetic data storage to quantum computing @xcite .",

    "are ideal materials in which to study the quantum properties of magnetic molecules , as the magnetic response is amplified by the huge number of molecules forming the crystal . the environment of the molecules in crystals is also well defined and can be characterized by techniques such as x - ray diffraction .",

    "mqt is due to interactions that break this axial symmetry and lead to transitions between magnetic states with opposite projections of spin on the magnetic easy axis .",

    "small modulations in the local environment around the magnetic cores have been found to be important in mqt @xcite . in particular , it has also been shown that in mn@xmath0-ac there are a variety of types of disorder that affect the magnetic properties of the molecules , including a distribution of solvent microenvironments , @xmath4 and @xmath5strain @xcite and a distribution of tilts of the easy axes of the molecules @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present high sensitivity magnetometry and high frequency electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) studies carried out on single crystals of mn@xmath0-ac .",

    "we show that variations in the local solvent environments around the mn@xmath0o@xmath0 magnetic cores are important to mqt because they lower the symmetry of the core and lead to tilts of the magnetic easy axis .",

    "in this case , the tunnel splitting , @xmath43 , depends on the azimuthal angle , @xmath54 , of the applied transverse field , @xmath50 .",
    "a transverse magnetic field applied along the medium axis produces a larger tunnel splitting than the same field applied along the hard axis .",
    "this leads to an oscillatory dependence of @xmath43 on @xmath54 with 2 maxima and minima separated by 90 degrees ( see fig .",

    "disorder allows for anisotropy terms that are lower order in the spin - operators than those imposed by the average molecule site symmetry in smm crystals .",
    "disorder can also lead to tilts of the easy axes from the crystallographic easy axis @xcite .",
    "the phenomena that have been explained by disorder can be summarized as follows : a ) observation of mqt relaxation at @xmath72-resonances that are not allowed by the quantum selection rules imposed by the symmetry of the molecule and b ) non - exponential magnetic relaxation which suggests the existence of a distribution of tunnel splittings .",

    "more recent magnetic relaxation experiments @xcite and high frequency epr experiments @xcite have confirmed the latter model , showing a 2-fold symmetry of the tunnel splitting as a function of the direction of an external transverse field .",
    "moreover , the observation of a distribution of transverse fields in mn@xmath0-brac @xcite and tilts in mn@xmath0-ac @xcite suggests that tilts of the easy axes of the molecules are responsible for the mqt relaxation at odd-@xmath72 resonances ; in the case of mn@xmath0-ac , these tilts are caused by the solvent disorder .",
    "we summarize these models and their consequences below .",

    "point ( b ) leads to a distribution of tunnel splittings , with a very long tail towards small values of the tunnel splitting . in a more recent experimental study , a landau - zener method that involved crossing",
    "the same mqt resonance several times permitted the study of nearly the whole distribution of tunnel splittings in a mn@xmath0-ac single crystal at a single resonance @xcite .",
    "the results obtained were compared to the distribution function proposed by chudnovsky and garanin .",
    "a distribution of second order anisotropies with mode at @xmath73 was not able to explain the relaxation data .",
    "more recently , both magnetic relaxation and high frequency epr experiments @xcite confirmed the discrete nature of the distribution of transverse anisotropies and , moreover , the fact that the magnetic axes of the transverse anisotropy is also discretely distributed along particular directions in the hard anisotropy plane of the molecules , contrary to the random distribution expected from the dislocation model",
    ".    _ solvent disorder . _ from x - ray diffraction studies cornia et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the fourfold symmetry of mn@xmath0-ac molecules is lowered by disorder of the acetic acid molecules ( 2 molecules with 4 possible sites ) .",
    "this gives rise to a set of six different molecules ( 4 of them with @xmath74 ) , with @xmath75 or @xmath76 of molecules thus having a non - zero second order transverse anisotropy .",
    "the fact that the second order anisotropy is generated by disorder in the solvent molecules implies that both the abundance and magnitude of the e for each isomer could depend on the synthesis process as well as on the solvent losses that a particular crystal experienced prior to measurement . from x - ray data cornia",
    "calculated the e parameters for the different isomers @xcite .",
    "these should be taken as estimates , since the data were obtained from one crystal and the e - parameters were computed using an empirical model .",
    "nonetheless , this model represents an important step in the understanding of mqt in mn@xmath0-ac .",
    "the relevant points of the solvent disorder model can be summarized as follows : a ) there is a discrete set of @xmath47 values in a sample .",
    "this means that the distribution of tunnel splittings is a discrete function with peaks at several @xmath77 values .",
    "b ) there are equal populations of isomers having opposite signs of the second order anisotropy @xmath78 .",
    "this means that the medium and hard axes associated with each @xmath47 value will be discretely distributed over the hard plane of the crystal with a separation of 90 degrees . and",
    "c ) the hard axes of the second order anisotropy are rotated away the hard / medium axes corresponding to the fourth order anisotropy ; this rotation angle depends on the precise details of the solvent structure , and is @xmath2830 degrees for mn@xmath0-ac .. the first point has been confirmed by high frequency epr experiments by the observation of discrete peaks in the absorption spectra that correspond to different discrete @xmath47 values and have the angular dependence expected from this model @xcite .",
    "the second point has been confirmed through magnetic relaxation measurements in which a portion of molecules having different signs of @xmath47 have been studied @xcite .",
    "the third point has been observed in epr experiments and has implications for the mqt discussed below .",
    "we note that both models suggest the presence of tilts of the easy magnetic axes of the molecules .",
    "these latter results , which have recently been confirmed via density functional calculations @xcite , will be presented in detail in the experimental sections of this paper .      in this section",
    "we will present model calculations of the dependence of the tunnel splitting on the angle and the magnitude of an external transverse field taking into account the presence of both second and fourth order anisotropies .",
    "these terms must be considered on an equal footing because they produce comparable tunnel splittings .",
    "this is seen as follows . in perturbation theory ,",
    "the splitting between levels @xmath31 and @xmath32 associated with the second order anisotropy is approximately @xmath79 , while that associated with the fourth order anisotropy is @xmath80 .",
    "thus , provided @xmath81 these are comparable in magnitude , _ independent _ of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "this is the case for mn@xmath0-ac , as @xmath82 k , @xmath83 k and @xmath84 k. for this reason there is an intricate interplay between these anisotropy terms that also occurs over a broad range of transverse magnetic fields , and can thus be probed both in epr and mqt studies .",
    "in mn@xmath0-ac these 2nd and 4th order transverse anisotropy terms have a different origin .",
    "the fourth order transverse anisotropy term is imposed by the symmetry of the molecule , while the second order term is generated by a distribution of solvent micro - environments .",
    "however , there is no reason to assume that these anisotropies are commensurate since they come from different sources ; one is associated with the ideal s@xmath3 symmetry , the other is disorder induced and lowers this symmetry .",
    "therefore , we will consider a misalignment angle , @xmath85 , between the magnetic axes associated with each transverse anisotropy term .",
    "we write the transverse anisotropy part , @xmath86 , of the hamiltonian ( eq .",
    "( 4 ) ) as follows : @xmath87 where , @xmath88 this introduces an angle @xmath85 between hard axes of the second and fourth order anisotropy terms ( see fig .",

    "the calculations have been done for parameters and conditions close to those shown in the experimental sections of this article . in the following we consider in some detail",
    "the consequences of the solvent disorder model as this can adequately explain many of our experimental observations .    as mentioned , one of the important consequences of the solvent disorder model is the fact that there must be equal populations of molecules having opposite signs of @xmath47 .",
    "this is because , on average , mn@xmath0-ac crystals have @xmath89 or tetragonal site symmetry .",
    "note that fig .",

    "subsequently , by performing angle dependent studies on each sub - species , one can deduce the underlying symmetries of the dominant tunneling matrix elements .",
    "while this method is extremely powerful , it is evident from the discussion in section ii.c that , for systems with multiple sources of transverse anisotropy ( intrinsic and extrinsic ) , deconvolution of the different contributions to the tunnel splittings can be problematic , i.e. in figs .",
    "6 to 9 it is seen that competing @xmath47 and @xmath49 terms results in a competition between the two - fold and four - fold symmetries of these interactions .",

    "however , the so - called `` tunnel - splittings '' are measured by the landau - zener method at low fields wherein the transverse terms operate in very high orders of perturbation theory within an @xmath273 basis ( see eq . ( 3 ) ) , where the quantization axis is defined by the global easy - axis of the crystal . for high magnetic fields applied in the transverse direction ,",
    "such a picture is no longer valid due to the conflicting symmetries imposed by the crystal field and the applied field .",
    "herein lies the beauty of the high - field epr technique . by applying a sufficiently strong transverse field , one can reach a limit in which the appropriate basis of spin states is defined by a quantization axis parallel to the applied field , i.e. the @xmath52-direction .",
    "in such a limit , transverse zero - field interactions operate in zeroth - order . consequently",
    ", their effects may be rather strong . as an illustration of this point ,",
    "consider the simplest zero - field hamiltonian : @xmath274 making a substitution for @xmath275 in terms of @xmath276 , one obtains : @xmath277 which can be re - written as : @xmath278 this equation is diagonal in @xmath279 , and has the same form as eq .",
    ". therefore , to lowest order , the high - field eigenvalues will be given by : @xmath280 similar arguments hold for higher order transverse terms .",
    "thus , the transverse high - field epr spectra provide perhaps the most direct means of measuring these transverse terms .",
    "indeed , this represents one of the more illustrative examples of the importance of high - field epr as a spectroscopic tool for studying quantum magnetism .",
    "not only does the effect of the zero - field transverse terms shift to zeroth order , but the symmetry of such interactions is also preserved .",
    "this is best illustrated using the same example as above , with the field applied along the @xmath53-axis instead of the @xmath52-axis . in this case , eq .",

    "this two - fold behavior is not unexpected ; indeed , it is obtained also from the exact diagonalization calculations shown in figs .",
    "6 to 8 , which correspond to the high - field / frequency limit discussed here .",
    "however , unlike lower - field calculations , the 2@xmath1 and 4@xmath2 order interactions decouple completely at high - fields , as do other transverse interactions .",

    "+ next we turn to the angle - dependent fine structures which are very apparent in the ranges @xmath311 and @xmath312 in fig .",
    "the first point to note is the fact that we see shoulders on both the high and low - field sides of the main peaks in these angle ranges .",
    "this contrasts the situation found from our earlier studies of h - mn@xmath0-ac  @xcite , where only high - field shoulders were observed .",
    "we comment on these differences at the end of this section .",
    "we first discuss the origin of the angle dependence of the shoulders , which are very apparent in the ranges @xmath313 and @xmath314 in fig .",
    "29 ; a more in - depth discussion can be found in refs .",
    "the high- and low - field shoulders are due to the @xmath315 and @xmath316 mn@xmath0-ac hydrogen - bonding variants in cornia s solvent disorder model @xcite .",
    "these variants , which comprise roughly @xmath243 of the total molecules , are thought to possess a significant rhombic anisotropy due to the reduced symmetry of the surrounding hydrogen bonded acetic acid solvent molecules .",
    "the second - order operator , @xmath317 , associated with the rhombic distortion gives rise to two - fold behavior , as was clearly demonstrated from the magnetic measurements in the previous section of this paper .",
    "it is important to recognize that the disorder is discrete , since the acetic acid can only bond at four positions on the mn@xmath0 molecule .",
    "thus , one expects only two hard directions associated with the @xmath315 and @xmath318 low symmetry variants , which are separated by @xmath319 . in hfepr",
    ", the @xmath317 operator causes shifts in the peak positions . when the applied transverse field is parallel to one of the hard axes , it is obviously perpendicular to the other , which causes shifts in the hfepr intensity to both the low- and high - field sides of the central peaks , hence the shoulders . when the field is applied in between these two directions , the epr intensity due to the low - symmetry variants collapses into the central portion of the peak , hence the disappearance of the shoulders every @xmath319 ( see figs . 29 and 30 ) .",
    "in actual fact , this apparent four - fold behavior reflects the two - fold nature of the rhombic distortion caused by the hydrogen bonding acetic acid molecules , with the epr intensity for a given variant shifting from the low ( high ) to the high ( low ) field side of the main peak every @xmath319 , i.e. the periodicity is actually @xmath320 .",
    "this two - fold behavior is then superimposed on the intrinsic four - fold periodicity , as can be seen from the red curves in fig .",
    "an important point to note from the hard - plane rotation data is the phase shift between the four - fold modulation of the central peak position ( blue curves in fig .",
    "30 ) and the two - fold shifts of the low and high field shoulders ( red curves in fig .",
    "indeed , this is one of the main points of this article .",
    "as discussed in section ii.c , this difference indicates a @xmath321 mis - alignment of the @xmath317 and @xmath291 tensors , as was originally suspected for h - mn@xmath0-ac @xcite .",

    "the difference between these fits is displayed in ( c ) , together with similar curves generated by the same procedure for peaks @xmath2046 and @xmath2044 .",

    "30 via exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix [ eq .",
    "this fit is represented by the horizontal bars in fig . 30 .",
    "our procedure obviously takes into account the mis- alignments of the @xmath317 and @xmath291 tensors , as described in section ii - c .",
    "thus , the employed hamiltonian is subtly different from the standard form used by most spectroscopists , which may explain slight differences in the obtained hamiltonian parameters .",
    "the only free parameters in the fit were then the @xmath47 and @xmath300 coefficients ( corresponding to the @xmath317 and @xmath291 tensors ) , for which we obtained the values @xmath325",

    "the @xmath47 value is significantly larger than the one obtained in earlier experiments ref .",
    "we attribute some of this difference to the modified hamiltonian used in our more recent fits , which takes into account the mis - alignments of the @xmath317 and @xmath291 tensors",
    ". however , much of the difference appears to be real .",
    "the larger @xmath47-value found from the present study is somewhat surprising .",
    "however , as will be seen below , more recent measurements on a very fresh h - mn@xmath0-ac sample are in excellent agreement with the value of @xmath325  @xmath303 found from this study ( open blue circles in fig .",
    "thus , the difference is likely related to sample quality and/or solvent loss .",
    "a tell - tale sign of the higher sample quality is the observation of both high- and low - field shoulders on the main epr peaks .",
    "in contrast , only high - field shoulders were seen in the earlier experiments on h- mn@xmath0-ac  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the absence of a low - field shoulder is discussed at some length in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is shown that this peak is unresolved from the broad low - field tail associated with the central portion of the peak .",
    "the reason for the asymmetry between the high and low - field shoulder is related to easy axis tilting caused by the solvent disorder ( discussed in the next sub - section ) .",
    "although both shoulders are seen in the present study , a clear asymmetry can be seen from the data in fig .",
    "we suspect that the samples used in the earlier experiments may have suffered significant solvent loss , either upon cooling from room temperature under high vacuum , or simply as a result of being stored in air for more than 1 year prior to the measurements .",
    "indeed , variations in the @xmath25-strain measured in different mn@xmath0-ac samples has previously been reported by us @xcite .",
    "increased @xmath25-strain leads to broader epr lines , thus probably explaining why the shoulders are clearly resolved in the present investigation , but not in refs .",
    "@xcite . without two well resolved shoulders ,",
    "it is likely that the @xmath47-strain was under - estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite , or it could simply be that the @xmath47-strain is weaker in samples that suffer significant solvent loss .",
    "based on more recent experience working with smms containing considerably more volatile solvents , we have recently developed sample handling procedures which minimize solvent loss , e.g. encapsulating samples in oil prior to cooling under atmospheric helium gas .",
    "the differences between the present measurements and those reported in refs .",
    "@xcite highlight the importance of sample handling .",
    "indeed , it is likely that mn@xmath0-ac samples prepared by different groups , and studied by different techniques , exhibit significant differences in their solvent content , resulting in subtly different conclusions concerning the quantum dynamics .",
    "solvent loss probably also provides an explanation for the widths of the distributions of tunnel splittings found in the magnetic relaxation experiments described in section iii . for this reason , it will be advantageous to prepare mn@xmath0-ac smms which do not exhibit such a dramatic dependence on solvent content .      in this section",
    ", we briefly present the results of measurements for field rotations away from the hard plane in order to illustrate the presence of a small distribution of tilts of the easy axes of the d - mn@xmath0-ac molecules .",
    "in the following figures , the polar angle @xmath30 represents the angle between the applied dc magnetic field and the global easy axis of the crystal , i.e. @xmath327 indicates the hard / medium - plane direction .",

    "again , the peaks in absorption correspond to epr , and the labeling is discussed in ref .",
    "the quality of the data is noticeably poorer than the data in fig .",
    "29 , and is due to the positioning of the sample at a different location in the cavity , where the geometry of the electromagnetic fields are not quite optimal for epr .",

    "@xcite , the transverse - field epr spectra for mn@xmath0-ac exhibit unusual selection rules for frequencies below 90 ghz : two series of resonances are separately observed ( labeled @xmath204 and @xmath85 ) as the magnetic field is tilted away from the hard plane .",
    "these selection rules are extremely sensitive to the field orientation for angles close to the hard plane .",
    "thus , deviations from the behavior predicted by the giant spin model ( eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) provide evidence for tilts of the molecules .",

    "34.a ) , and a 3d view for the @xmath327 to @xmath328 range ( fig .",
    "these 15 k simulations were generated using the accepted hamiltonian parameters given above .",
    "a gaussian line shape was employed with a line width typical for a single solvent - disorder variant in cornia s model ( see ref .",
    "while this line shape / width is clearly quite different from the experimental data , which is complicated by the contributions of several mn@xmath0-ac variants , we note that the choice of line width / shape does not in any way affect the following analysis .",
    "the simulations indicate a range of about @xmath334 ( from @xmath335 to @xmath336 ) over which the epr intensity associated with both the @xmath2048 and @xmath2047 transitions is negligible .",
    "thus , for a perfect crystal , without any disorder , one should expect a similar behavior in the actual epr spectra .",
    "however , careful inspection of fig .",
    "32 and 33 indicates a significant overlap of the @xmath2048 and @xmath857 peaks in the @xmath337 to @xmath338 range .",
    "these two facts point to a spread in the orientations of the magnetic axes of the molecules , with a cut - off of at @xmath339 away from the global directions , i.e. we predict that , on average , the magnetic easy axes of the low - symmetry ( disordered ) molecules are tilted away from the crystallographic @xmath11-axis , and that the distribution extends roughly @xmath340 . once again , a very similar behavior has been observed for h - mn@xmath0-ac in ref .",
    "@xcite , albeit that the distribution extends to @xmath341 .",
    "we note that the h - mn@xmath0-ac experiments were conducted using a rotating cavity @xcite to higher magnetic fields , where the experimental deviation from the simulation is even more pronounced .",
    "thus , easy axis tilting appears to be a general feature in mn@xmath0-ac and , as discussed earlier in this article , this likely provides an explanation for the lack of selection rules in the magnetization steps observed from hysteresis experiments .",
    "the slightly broader tilt distribution for h - mn@xmath0-ac may be related to the increased solvent loss .",
    "finally , we comment on the correlation between the disorder - induced rhombic anisotropy and the easy axis tilting .",
    "it has been shown by park et al .",
    "@xcite , that the magnetic anisotropy tensor absolutely determines the orientations of the principal magnetic axes . in other words ,",
    "one expects the effects of the solvent disorder to be accompanied by local easy - axis tilting .",
    "this was also pointed out by cornia et al .",
    "@xcite in their x - ray analysis of mn@xmath0-ac .",
    "we have subsequently shown this to be the case from epr studies of h - mn@xmath0-ac @xcite , where it was shown that the high - field fine structures in the transverse epr spectra displayed a different angle dependence compared to the main peaks .",
    "these findings suggested that each solvent disorder variant has a distinct angle dependence and , therefore , a distinct tilting behavior , i.e. the tilting and the anisotropy are correlated .",
    "this is again apparent for d - mn@xmath0-ac from fig .",
    "33.a , where the shoulders are visible as narrow horizontal streaks on the high field sides of each of the main peaks .",
    "it is quite evident that the narrow streaks ( i.e. the shoulders ) span a narrower angle range compared to the main peaks .",
    "in fact , the high field shoulders on the @xmath342 and @xmath343 peaks exhibit a considerable range where neither is observed .",
    "indeed , this range corresponds almost exactly to the @xmath334 found from the simulations ( fig .",
    "it is important to note that this local tilting of the magnetic axes ( caused by local symmetry lowering ) , is quite different from physical tilting of the molecules caused e.g. by strains in the sample .",
    "comparisons between figs .",
    "32 , 33 and 34 indicate that the angle dependence of the high - field shoulders agrees very well with the simulations .",
    "the reason for these differences between the main peaks and the shoulders is explained in ref . @xcite as being due to discrete easy axis tilting , wherein the tilting is confined to two orthogonal planes defined by the hard and medium directions of the associated disorder - induced @xmath317(@xmath47 ) zero - field tensor .",
    "essentially , the high - field shoulders on the epr peaks are due to molecules which are tilted in a plane which is approximately perpendicular to the plane of rotation of the applied magnetic field .",
    "consequently , the tilts due to these molecules do not project onto the field rotation plane , i.e. the experiment is insensitive to tilts in this direction .",
    "meanwhile , the low - field tail of the epr peaks is due to molecules which tilt in the orthogonal plane . for these molecules ,",
    "the tilts have a maximum projection on to the field rotation plane , i.e. the experiment is maximally sensitive to tilts in this direction .",
    "the present studies support the findings of the original study for h - mn@xmath0-ac @xcite , providing further confirmation for the discrete tilting idea .",
    "in summary , these experiments provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence the symmetry of mqt in mn@xmath0-ac , the first and most widely studied smm .",
    "interestingly , the reason so much attention has focused on mn@xmath0 has been the high global symmetry of single crystals , as most known smms have lower site symmetry .",
    "the data presented here show that disorder lowers the symmetry locally and leads to an intricate interaction between transverse anisotropy terms : the first associated with disorder and the second intrinsic to an `` ideal '' mn@xmath0-molecule .",
    "while at first sight a nuisance , these complexities have been interesting from many perspectives . from experiment , they have been a challenge to understand and characterize , and have required combining unique advanced and sensitive magnetic techniques that have been developed by the authors over many years . in particular , this research involved combining single crystal high - frequency and high - field epr and low - temperature magnetometry , both with arbitrarily directed applied magnetic fields .",
    "the results obtained by magnetic measurements of mqt have had implications for epr studies and vice - versa . from a theoretical perspective , given a structural model of the molecule and solvent environment , density functional theory has been able to capture many of the features observed in these experiments , including the magnitudes and form of the transverse magnetic anisotropies and the easy axis tilts @xcite .",
    "this includes the angle between the 2nd order and 4th order transverse anisotropies , which has been central to understanding the combined data set , as well as the easy axis tilts .",
    "this research thus represents an important milestone in our understanding of the factors that influence mqt in smms .",
