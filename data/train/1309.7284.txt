    "the existence of a minimal length uncertainty is one of the common aspects of various theories of quantum gravity such as string theory , loop quantum gravity , quantum geometry , and black - hole physics .",
    "all these proposals predict a minimum measurable length of the order of the planck length @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the newton s gravitational constant . in recent years",
    ", many papers have appeared in the literature to address the effects of the minimal length on various physical systems in the framework of the generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) @xcite .",
    "recently , several approaches have been developed for testing the effects of quantum gravity which range from astronomical observations @xcite to table - top experiments @xcite .",
    "we can mention the proposal by amelino - camelia and lammerzahl that explains puzzling observations of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays in the framework of ( quantum gravity ) modified laws for particle propagation @xcite .",
    "the usage of high intensity laser projects for quantum gravity phenomenology is also suggested by magueijo in the context of deformed special relativity @xcite .",
    "have proposed a direct measurement scheme to experimentally test the existence of a minimal length scale using a quantum optical ancillary system @xcite .",
    "they probed possible deviations from ordinary quantum commutation relation at the planck scale within reach of current technology .",
    "these progresses could shed light on possible detectable planck - scale effects .",
    "on the other hand , doubly special relativity ( dsr ) theories essentially require the existence of a maximal momentum @xcite .",
    "a gup proposal which is consistent with these theories is discussed in refs .",
    "moreover , another gup scenario which agrees with the seminal proposal by kempf , mangano and mann ( kmm ) @xcite to first order of the gup parameter is recently proposed in refs .",
    "the latter gup model implies the noncommutative geometry , i.e.  @xmath5\\ne 0 $ ] , and predicts both a minimal length uncertainty and a maximal momentum proportional to @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively , where @xmath2 is the gup parameter .",
    "various problems such as the free particle , particle in a box , harmonic oscillator , black body radiation , cosmological constant , maximally localized states , and hydrogen atom have been previously studied in this framework @xcite .",
    "the quantum stationary solutions of the schrdinger equation that describes particles bouncing vertically and elastically above a horizontal reflecting mirror in the earth s gravitational field is well - known theoretically .",
    "however , the experimental realization of this phenomenon is so difficult due to two main reasons .",
    "first , for the macroscopic objects the gravitational quantum effects are negligible . also , the electromagnetic interaction has the dominate role for the charged particles .",
    "thus , we need to perform the experiment using neutral elementary particles with a long lifetime such as neutrons . this famous experiment has been demonstrated a few years ago by nesvizhevsky et al . using a high precision neutron gravitational spectrometer @xcite .",
    "notice that , the perturbative effects of the minimal length and/or maximal momentum on the quantum bouncer spectrum are studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the context of the kmm gup where there exists just a minimal length uncertainty this problem",
    "is exactly solved in ref .",
    "consider the following deformed commutation relation that implies both a minimal length uncertainty and a maximal observable momentum @xcite @xmath6=\\frac{i\\hbar}{1-\\beta p^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the gup parameter , @xmath8 is the planck mass and @xmath9 is the dimensionless gup parameter .",
    "note that the maximal momentum is introduced kinematically without breaking translation invariance .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this invariance will be broken in the presence of the minimum momentum uncertainty namely by introducing position operator on the right hand side of the canonical commutation relation ( ccr ) @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the minimum momentum uncertainty can arise from curvature , as it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . to avoid the singularity problem we need to write out that rational term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ gupc ] ) as a geometric series .",
    "then the singularity of the denominator becomes a finite radius of convergence of the geometric series .",
    "otherwise , we face with the issue that the momentum can also be larger than the cutoff .",
    "basically , we get three irreducible representations of the ccr , one with the momentum confined to the desired range , one with the momentum confined to above and the other with the momentum confined to below .",
    "a similar issue arises when a momentum cutoff is introduced dynamically in the action @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to check that the above commutation relation results in the generalized uncertainty relation @xmath10}$ ] and @xmath11 in the momentum space representation , @xmath12 and @xmath13 can be written as @xmath14 using the symmetricity condition for the position operator the completeness relation and the scalar product are given by @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "also , the identity operator is @xmath17 and the normalized ( unphysical ) eigenfunctions of the position operator in momentum space read @xmath18 , $ ] where @xmath19 denotes the eigenvalues of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "now consider a particle of mass @xmath20 which is bouncing vertically and elastically on a reflecting mirror . the potential is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the acceleration in the earth s gravitational field . in the absence of gup ,",
    "i.e.  @xmath23 , this problem is exactly solvable and the solutions are given by the airy functions .",
    "also , the energy spectrum correspond to the zeros of the airy function . in the semiclassical approximation",
    ", the bohr - sommerfeld formula gives the approximate energy levels as @xmath24 ^ 2\\right)^{1/3 } $ ] which provides almost exact results even for the low quantum levels .",
    "the generalized schrdinger equation now reads @xmath25 in the momentum space and using eqs .",
    "( [ rep1],[rep2 ] ) we obtain @xmath26 where prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath27 .",
    "the solution is @xmath28\\exp\\left[\\frac{-i\\alpha \\beta p^3}{\\hbar}\\left(\\frac{p^2}{5}-\\frac{2me}{3}\\right)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 .",
    "now , using the identity operator , the wave function in coordinate space is given by @xmath30\\phi(p)\\mathrm{d}p.\\hspace{.75cm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so in terms of the new variable @xmath31 we find @xmath32 \\exp\\left[\\frac{i z p}{\\hbar}\\left(1-\\frac{\\beta}{3}p^2\\right)\\right]\\mathrm{d}p.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to proceed further , let us define the dimensionless variables @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 have dimension of length and momentum , respectively , and @xmath38 .",
    "so the wave function reads @xmath39 \\exp\\left[i\\tilde{z } \\tilde{p}\\left(1-\\frac{\\tilde\\beta}{3}\\tilde{p}^2\\right)\\right]\\mathrm{d}\\tilde{p}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because of the dirichlet boundary condition at @xmath40 , the energy eigenvalues are given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 are given by @xmath43 .",
    "now we set @xmath44 and evaluate the above integral numerically .",
    "so we have @xmath45 and the energy eigenvalues can be written as @xmath46 , where in the absence of gup ( @xmath47 ) , @xmath42 are zeros of the airy function and we obtain the energy spectrum of the quantum bouncer in ordinary quantum mechanics . figure [ fig1 ] shows the wave function @xmath48 for @xmath49 where its zeros correspond to the energy spectrum .",
    "also , table [ tab1 ] shows the first ten quantized energies of the quantum bouncer in the absence of gup and in the presence of the minimal length and maximal momentum .",
    "as it can be seen from the table , all energy levels satisfy @xmath50    the wave function @xmath48 for @xmath51.,width=302 ]    .[tab1]the first ten quantized energies of a bouncing particle . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table [ tab2 ] we have reported the exact and semiclassical energy spectrum of the quantum bouncer in the gup framework for @xmath52 .",
    "( [ root ] ) shows , the existence of the maximum energy is manifest in the semiclassical description of the problem .",
    "the maximal energy is given by the condition @xmath53=0 $ ] , i.e. , @xmath54 and @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the largest integer not greater than @xmath19 .",
    "however , the semiclassical number of states and maximal energies differ considerably with the quantum mechanical results . for instance , for @xmath57 we have @xmath58 and @xmath59 . but its quantum mechanical values are @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "also , for @xmath62 we obtain @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "notice that , because of @xmath67 , the dimensionless gup parameter @xmath68 is given by @xmath69 there are some upper bounds for @xmath9 in the literature based on the accuracy of current experiments @xcite . for instance , for the lamb shift",
    "the upper bound is given by @xmath70 , and for the landau levels we have @xmath71 .",
    "also , for the scanning tunneling microscope the current experiments imply @xmath72 .",
    "more accurate measurements can be used to test these upper bounds or further tighten these values .",
    "now , based on the the exact quantum mechanical results and the accuracy measured for the ground state in nesvizhevsky s experiment @xcite , the upper bound reads @xmath73 or @xmath74 the length scale corresponding to this dimensionless gup parameter is @xmath75 .",
    "the above upper bound is far weaker than that set by the electroweak scale , namely @xmath76 @xcite , but it is not incompatible with it . indeed , using more accurate results in the future experiments , this upper bound is expected to get reduced by several orders of magnitude . in this case",
    ", it represents a new and intermediate length scale between the electroweak and the planck scale .",
    "our results can be interpreted in two ways : ( a ) the predictions of this gup are too small to measure at present ( @xmath77 ) , or ( b ) there exists a new intermediate length scale ( @xmath78 ) that may appear in future experiments in the large hadron collider .",
    "in this paper , we studied the problem of the quantum bouncer in the presence of the minimal length uncertainty and the maximal momentum .",
    "we solved the generalized schrdinger equation in the momentum space and found the exact energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions .",
    "we studied this problem semiclassically and showed that the number of solutions are finite and the energy is bounded from above .",
    "these effects are new and are absent in ordinary quantum mechanics and the kmm gup framework .",
    "also , the transition probability of the ultra cold neutrons in the presence of the generalized uncertainty principle and in quadrupole approximation is obtained .",
    "we finally found an upper bound on the dimensionless gup parameter based on the nesvizhevsky s experiment .",
