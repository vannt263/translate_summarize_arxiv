    "a comprehensive theory of vortex dynamics in quantum fluids must address phenomena occurring at three different length scales . at the smallest , most microscopic scale , a fully quantum mechanical treatment of a vortex , including its internal structure ,",
    "interaction with elementary excitations such as phonons and rotons , and interaction with disorder , is required    at the next ",
    "what we shall refer to as intermediate ",
    "length scale , one would like to regard a vortex as a classical object , subject to a classical equation of motion . of course , there is no guarantee that we can do this , and , indeed , certain pathologies result from our insistence in doing so , but experience has shown that this classical picture is extremely successful.@xcite    there are different ways to formulate the classical approach . if we let @xmath0 denote the position in the @xmath1 plane of the center of an isolated straight vortex line , say , as a function of time , we could hypothesize a phenomenological equation of motion of the form @xmath2 here we have taken the circulation vector @xmath3 of the vortex , a vector parallel to the vortex with a magnitude equal to the circulation , to be along the @xmath4 direction .",
    "the first two terms on the right - hand - side of ( [ equation of motion ] ) are to include all forces linear in the vortex velocity .",
    "the coefficients @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , which describe the vortex effective mass per unit length , viscous damping force per unit length , and nondissipative transverse force per unit length , respectively , are to be determined from a microscopic theory , as are the `` pinning '' and `` driving '' forces per unit length @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the latter may depend on the normal and superfluid densities and velocities , and therefore on the vortex position @xmath10 , but do not depend on the vortex velocity . in a superfluid , @xmath8 might describe the force exerted by an externally imposed wire , and @xmath9 would include the superfluid - velocity - dependent part of the magnus force ( see below ) and possibly other vortex - velocity - independent contributions .    at the most macroscopic scale one needs to understand how the forces arising at the intermediate scale act to determine the bulk , experimentally observable properties of quantum fluids . the length scale that usually defines this regime is the characteristic inter - vortex distance , and one is interested in coarse - grained properties of the quantum fluid at scales larger than that distance . in superfluids ,",
    "this is the regime where the concept of mutual friction applies .",
    "mutual friction refers to a momentum transfer , with both longitudinal and transverse components , between the normal and superfluid parts of a quantum fluid.@xcite although such an interaction is absent in the two - fluid model itself , the presence of vortices mediate a bulk momentum exchange",
    ". similarly , in superconductors one needs to understand how the lorentz force , pinning forces , and other intermediate - scale forces conspire to determine , say , the hall effect in the mixed state , which depends on the collective motion of a macroscopic number of vortices.@xcite    our recent work has focused mostly on the intermediate length - scale regime , namely , the determination of the various forces that act on vortices . after a brief general review of that work we shall discuss our new results on the problem of the iordanskii and lifshitz - pitaevskii forces , which have been subjects of considerable controversy .",
    "the thouless - ao - niu ( tan ) theory@xcite and its generalization to ultraclean type - ii superconductors@xcite start with the appropriate exact many - body hamiltonian and include a pinning potential centered at @xmath10 , which is also the position of the vortex .",
    "the vortex is then dragged with a velocity @xmath11 , and a transverse force @xmath12 is found . here @xmath13 is the canonical momentum density , and the line integral is taken around a large circle enclosing the vortex . evidently , the transverse force is independent of the detailed microscopic structure of the vortex and its interaction with the normal fluid .    in a neutral bose or fermi superfluid , @xmath14 and therefore @xmath15 in the normal fluid component ,",
    "viscosity causes vortex - like circulation to diffuse away to the outer boundary , so @xmath16 vanishes in equilibrium , and @xmath17    in a charged superfluid or superconductor , however , the hamiltonian contains a current - current interaction term that modifies the velocity operator . the canonical momentum density can be expressed in terms of the physical , gauge - invariant momentum density @xmath18 , resulting in @xmath19 the second equality in ( [ sc case ] ) follows from the meissner effect , which causes @xmath20 to vanish at large distances , and from flux quantization .",
    "therefore , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the total mass density of the fluid .",
    "we turn now to a brief discussion of some of the controversies in the theory of intermediate - scale vortex dynamics , focusing on transverse forces , and organized according to the complexity of the quantum fluid in question .",
    "it seems appropriate to start by recalling a result of classical hydrodynamics , the magnus force : when a vortex with circulation @xmath3 is dragged with velocity @xmath11 through an ideal fluid of mass density @xmath23 , a transverse force per unit length @xmath24 acts on the object doing the dragging .",
    "the force is similar to the lift force on an airplane wing .",
    "it is clear from galilean invariance that if the fluid far from the vortex is not at rest , but has a velocity @xmath25 , then the force is instead @xmath26    by analogy , it is reasonable in a neutral bose superfluid at zero temperature to expect that @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the quantized circulation .",
    "of course , writing @xmath29 here instead of @xmath23 is arbitrary , because these are equal at zero temperature .",
    "the controversy begins in the finite - temperature neutral bose superfluid , because galilean invariance allows for a transverse force of the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are parameters . the first term in ( [ general sf magnus force ] )",
    "has a simple classical interpretation : it describes a magnus - type force originating from the superfluid component of the fluid ( remembering that it is the superfluid that is circulating ) .",
    "thus classical reasoning would suggest that @xmath33 , and wexler has recently given an elegant proof of this.@xcite to our knowledge there have been no criticisms of wexler s theory .    from this classical point - of - view ,",
    "again keeping in mind that it is the superfluid that is circulating here , the second term in ( [ general sf magnus force ] ) would be of a nonhydrodynamic origin .",
    "if present , it would describe a transverse interaction between the vortex and the excitations  phonons and rotons  of the fluid .",
    "iordanskii@xcite predicted just such an interaction with phonons , and lifshitz and pitaevskii@xcite ( following earlier work by hall and vinen@xcite ) predicted one with rotons .",
    "note , however , that in these works @xmath34 and @xmath35 refer to flow velocities _ near _ the vortex line , whereas our quantities are asymptotic values .",
    "but the tan result ( [ sf transverse force ] ) implies @xmath36 .",
    "when combined with wexler s theory , this implies @xmath37 , i.e. , that there are no transverse iordanskii and lifshitz - pitaevskii forces .",
    "this apparent discrepancy has motivated us to understand better the interaction between a quantized vortex and the normal fluid in a neutral bose system , and to calculate the coefficient @xmath32 in ( [ general sf magnus force ] ) directly .",
    "we shall return to this direct calculation below in section [ two - fluid ]    the next controversy concerns the transverse force in a neutral fermi superfluid , also described in the tan theory . according to kopnin and kravtsov,@xcite low - energy quasiparticles in the vortex core also contribute to the transverse force linear in @xmath11 , a contribution not found by tan .",
    "vortices in superconductors inherit all of the above controversies and have additional complexity of their own.@xcite we will not have space to discuss them further .",
    "two ingredients are needed for a microscopic theory of the coefficient @xmath32 in eqn .",
    "( [ general sf magnus force ] ) .",
    "first , one has to solve a vortex - excitation scattering problem .",
    "it is probably correct to use the gross - pitaevskii equation to do this , even though mean field theory is not expected to hold inside the vortex , because the scattering potential is long - ranged .",
    "in fact , the potential is sufficiently long - ranged , and the forward scattering sufficiently singular , that there are several mathematically incorrect scattering calculations present in the literature.@xcite    in the scale of lengths greater than the size of the vortex core and less than the mean free path for scattering of excitations by one another , if there is such a range , the dynamics of excitations moving in the slowly varying background of the rotating superfluid is well defined , and in this region the traditional arguments@xcite give a transverse force on the excitations equal to @xmath38 , where @xmath35 is the average normal fluid velocity at a distance of the order of the mean free path from the vortex core , as well as a dissipative longitudinal force .    in the region well beyond a mean free path from the vortex core , flow velocities are varying slowly and two - fluid hydrodynamics , which incorporates the basic conservation laws , provides an accurate description .",
    "in particular , the two - fluid version of the navier  stokes equation gives the force  momentum balance . in this region we have studied how forces generated within a mean free path of the vortex core can be transmitted to large distances.@xcite within a linearized approximation to the two - fluid model the force due to the superfluid flow relative to the vortex is just the ordinary superfluid magnus force @xmath39 , where @xmath34 is the asymptotic value of the superfluid velocity .",
    "this is given for superfluids , as it is for ordinary fluids , by the cross terms , between circulation and the superfluid flow , in the momentum flow tensor and the bernoulli pressure .",
    "there seems to be no possible modification of this even for a fermionic superfluid , such as is suggested by the work of kopnin and kravtsov,@xcite if there is no bulk interaction with a stationary background .    for the normal fluid contributions our considerations are quite similar to those of hall and vinen.@xcite in the linear regime the force",
    "is transmitted by the viscous force ( and an accompanying pressure term ) , which is generated by a flow velocity in the direction of the force that increases as the logarithm of the distance from the vortex core .",
    "the asymptotic value of the normal fluid velocity is given by a combination of the value @xmath35 close to the core , and this logarithmically growing term .",
    "the logarithmically growing term has to be cut off at a distance @xmath40 which is determined by the reynolds number of the flow , by the spacing between vortices , or by the diffusion length at the frequency of vortex oscillation . in the limit considered by tan , with vanishingly small normal fluid velocity , and a single vortex in an infinite medium , this",
    "cut - off goes to infinity , and @xmath35 is negligibly small in comparison , so the asymptotic velocity is determined by the logarithmic term , and the force is parallel to the normal fluid flow .",
    "realistically , the logarithm which the cut - off introduces is not necessarily large compared with other parameters in the problem .",
    "even when the iordanskii force is not put in explicitly at the inner boundary , there is some transverse force due to normal fluid flow , but this is proportional to @xmath41^{-2 } \\ , v_{\\rm n}$ ] , where @xmath42 is the mean free path .",
    "it is not clear how to match conditions close to the core with conditions in the hydrodynamic region , but if it is assumed that the iordanskii force causes @xmath35 close to the core to match the viscous force in the hydrodynamic region , and to be parallel to it , the relative importance of the logarithmic term will depend on the ratio of the kinematic viscosity @xmath43 to the quantum of circulation  a large kinematic viscosity will diminish the importance of the logarithmic term in the flow velocity .",
