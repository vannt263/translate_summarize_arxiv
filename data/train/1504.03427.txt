    "black hole mass is a fundamental quasar property , and better measuring poorly known fundamental properties has the potential to lead to breakthroughs .",
    "moreover , correlations between the central black hole mass in galaxies , both active and inactive , and other properties such as the stellar velocity dispersion and bulge luminosity ( marconi & hunt 2003 ; tremaine et al . 2002 ; kormendy & ho 2013 ) , may indicate a connection necessary to understanding galaxy evolution more generally .",
    "several methods exist to directly measure or indirectly estimate the central black hole masses of quasars ( see shen 2013 for a review ) .",
    "a primary method of measuring black hole masses is via reverberation mapping ( rm , e.g. , peterson 1993 ) .",
    "the underlying premise is that broad - line region ( blr ) gas moves virially under gravity ( peterson & wandel 1999 , onken et al .",
    "this means that blr gas at a distance r@xmath4 with a velocity @xmath5v can be used to provide the central mass using an equation of the form :    @xmath6    the factor @xmath7  includes our ignorance about geometry ( and perhaps other complications ) , and is obtained by calibration against inactive galaxies ( e.g. , onken et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "rm programs provide the radius r@xmath4 via time lags between the continuum and line flux , while the velocity @xmath5v is measured from the variable portion of the emission - line profile .",
    "both the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) and the line dispersion @xmath8 of the rms profile have been used , in conjunction with an appropriately calibrated @xmath7 .",
    "we will refer to the quantity @xmath9 as the virial product .",
    "numerous campaigns over more than two decades ( e.g. clavel et al . 1991 ; kaspi et al .",
    "2000 , 2007 ; peterson et al .",
    "2004 , bentz et al . 2009b ; denney et al .",
    "2010 ) have provided virial products for over 50 objects , which are not necessarily representative of active galaxies in general ( e.g. , shen 2013 ) .    because of",
    "the large observational resources required for rm , easier methods of estimating black hole masses have been developed , e.g. , black hole mass scaling relationships ( e.g. , vestergaard 2002 ) .",
    "single - epoch ( se ) spectra , rather than rms spectra , provide line - profile measurements , while the radius - luminosity relationship ( e.g. , kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ; bentz et al .",
    "2006 ) provides @xmath10 rather than a time lag .",
    "these two points permit the modification of equation 1 and lead to :    @xmath11    the exponent @xmath12  appears to be consistent with 0.5 , at least when the host galaxy contribution to the continuum is accounted for ( e.g. , bentz et al .",
    "2009a ) , as expected for some simple blr models ( e.g. , netzer 1990 ) .",
    "in practice , the black hole mass can be calculated from the combination of the unscaled mass @xmath13 and a constant @xmath14 , which provides the scaling factor :    @xmath15    @xmath16    the scaling relationships are not very precise , unfortunately , and may not be very accurate , either , as we shall demonstrate .",
    "black hole masses calculated with these equations are typically uncertain to factors of 3 - 4 ( vestergaard & peterson 2006 , hereafter vp06 ) . given their utility , needing only a se spectrum , however , it is desirable to improve existing relationships ( in particular for those using ultraviolet lines like c  iv @xmath01549 , which is redshifted into the optical regime for high - z quasars ) . despite possible biases in selection ,",
    "rm samples have been used to calibrate the se scaling relationships .",
    "the formulations of vp06 and vestergaard & osmer ( 2009 ) have been two often - employed examples .",
    "recently park et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , using more reliable reverberation masses and myriad small improvements , have updated the c iv - based scaling relationship .",
    "there have been a number of concerns noted regarding black hole mass estimates using c  iv ( e.g. , croom 2011 , assef et al .",
    "2011 , trakhtenbrot & netzer 2012 , etc . ) .",
    "the primary criticism is that the fwhm of the c  iv line does not always correlate well with that of h@xmath17 in se spectra , and that the former is often narrower than the latter , the reverse of the results for the rms profiles from rm campaigns ( e.g. , onken et al .",
    "the se profile of c  iv probably does not reflect purely virial motions .",
    "denney ( 2012 ) compared the reverberating component of c  iv against average profiles , showing evidence for a low - velocity emission - line region that did not vary , consistent with low - velocity c  iv - emitting gas existing on much larger size scales ( in accordance with analysis of gravitationally lensed systems , sluse et al .",
    "these non - varying line cores can be interpreted as the `` intermediate - line region '' or ilr ( wills et al .",
    "1993 ; brotherton et al .",
    "denney also showed that a profile shape parameter ( @xmath18 ) measuring the contamination of the c  iv line by this non - virial component correlates with the differences between c  iv and h@xmath17 mass estimates and could perhaps be used to correct c  iv - derived masses .",
    "the degree of non - virial / ilr c  iv",
    "contamination also correlates with a suite of properties collectively known as `` eigenvector 1 '' ( hereafter ev1 ; see boroson and green 1992 ; brotherton & francis 1998 ; sulentic 2007 ; etc . ) . in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum ,",
    "these properties include the shape of the c  iv profile , as well as certain emission - line ratios and the difference between peak velocities .",
    "shen et al . (",
    "2008 ; see also shen & liu 2012 ) find a bias in c  iv black hole masses associated with these emission - line velocity shifts .",
    "bian et al .",
    "( 2012 ) also note a systematic difference between c  iv and mg ii based black hole masses that related to the equivalent width of c  iv , another ev1 property .",

    "( 1993 ) , runnoe et al .",
    "( 2013a , hereafter paper 1 ) developed a new c  iv mass correction relying on the log of the ratio of the continuum - subtracted peak heights of the @xmath01400 blend ( of si iv and o iv ] ) and c  iv .",
    "figure 1 shows a significant inverse correlation between the peak ratio and the equivalent width of c  iv , demonstrating that this peak ratio is also part of ev1 .",
    "paper 1 provided a mass correction term based on this peak ratio that improves the scatter between c  iv and h@xmath17 derived masses by @xmath190.1 dex , or about 25% .",
    "there was also a suggestion of a bias in the vp06 c  iv scaling relationship , such that c  iv based masses systematically differed on average from h@xmath17 , which could result in part from an ev1 bias in the rm sample that it and other scaling relationships are based upon .",

    ", width=8 ]    here we will examine quantitatively how sample biases in ev1 lead to systematic shifts in estimates of black hole mass using c  iv - based scaling relationships , and the implications of this for determining what the best practices should be going forward to pursue better black hole masses .",
    "in particular we are concerned about commonly used scaling relationships based on rm samples that , while possessing superior and direct black hole mass measurements , may be biased with respect to ev1 .    there may be several issues that affect se c  iv black hole mass scaling relationships , and we use a careful approach to isolate the ev1 bias .",
    "it is beneficial to use consistent calibration , measurements , and quasi - simultaneous optical - uv spectra when possible , or risk offsets associated with those issues ( e.g. , see denney et al . 2009 and 2013 ) .",

    "ideally we would use the vp06 and park et al .",
    "( 2013 ) data and measurements , but there are several problems with that approach .",
    "first , they did not provide the peak @xmath01400/civ measurements we require to reproduce the paper 1 analyses .",
    "second , after making our own measurements as described in  2 , the dispersion of peak @xmath01400/civ in the rm objects is too small to significantly correlate with the difference between the c  iv and h@xmath17 line widths as it does in our paper 1 sample . for these reasons , we will create samples matched to the rm objects with our own data in order to determine how the ev1 bias affects calculated masses . by using our own high - quality data sets and our own measurements",
    ", we can avoid inconsistency .    in  3 , we determine black hole mass scaling relationships for subsamples drawn from the data set of shang et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , each with different distributions of peak @xmath01400/c  iv measurements from paper 1 , and demonstrate the effect on se scaling relationships .",
    "we repeat the same experiment for both nearly complete samples and for a carefully selected sample sample to show the effect of an ev1 bias on existing samples of rm quasars . in  4 , we discuss near - term and long - term resolutions to this problem , which will allow c  iv to be used as a more effective mass estimator . finally , ",
    "5 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "for our analysis , we use the sample from paper 1 , that of shang et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , which includes 85 quasars drawn from several sources .",
    "the unifying factor in assembling this composite sample was the existence of quasi - simultaneous spectrophotometry ( within weeks or less ) , obtained in the near - ultraviolet taken with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ , and in the optical from ground - based telescopes at kitt peak national observatory and mcdonald observatory .",

    "we use two rm samples that represent the basis for a commonly used c  iv - based black hole mass scaling relationship and its recent update : vp06 and park et al .",
    "we obtained ultraviolet spectra from the multimission archive at space telescope ( mast ) .",
    "these come not only from _ hst _ spectrographs , but also the _",
    "hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut ) , _ and the _ international ultraviolet explorer ( iue)_. in a few cases where multiple epochs of spectra were available for an object , we used the one that had the best combination of signal - to - noise ratio and wavelength coverage containing the @xmath01400 feature .",
    "we fit the @xmath01400 feature and c  iv line using a multiple gaussian and a local continuum following the method of tang et al .",

    "we checked our fitting procedure against paper 1 for the sed sample and found agreement within the uncertainties , as well as overall systematic agreement to better than a few per cent .",
    "our paper 1 approach was conservative , characterizing uncertainties on peak @xmath01400/c  iv as @xmath26 .",
    "while this ensures measurement consistency between the samples , we noted that measurements of peak @xmath01400/c  iv for the same objects observed at different epochs usually agreed within 15% ( e.g. , mrk 335  0.16 vs. 0.15 ) , but not always ( e.g. , ngc 7469",
    " 0.17 vs. 0.10 ) .",
    "these differences are due to real , intrinsic variability and serve as a caution to the use of non - simultaneous data .",

    "( 2013 ) . from vp06 , we have excluded ngc 3516 , ngc 4051 , ngc 4151 , and ngc 4593 because of absorption in c  iv making a peak flux too difficult to measure reliably .",

    "we do not use these peak @xmath01400/c  iv measurements directly , only to select a well - matched sample with similar mean and dispersion from our sed sample for a self - consistent analysis .",
    "table 1 includes peak @xmath01400/c  iv measurements for a typical simulated rm sample matched to park et al .",
    "again , we want to analyze our own objects with our own consistent measurements and avoid any artificial biases associated with differences in measurement methodology .    we simulated a dozen rm samples , drawing 23 objects from the parent sample of paper 1 , matching a quasar with log peak @xmath01400/c  iv to within 0.1 dex ( 25% ) of a corresponding object from park et al .",
    "we selected one of these as our `` simulated rm sample '' on the basis of a very close match in log peak @xmath01400/c  iv ( both @xmath220.76 ) .",
    "our choice for illustrative rm sample also possessed the simulated sample average value of @xmath14 = 6.87 based on intercept fitting described in @xmath27 3 , and was thus representative of the simulated samples and not an outlier .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the mean value of log peak @xmath01400/c  iv is @xmath220.62 in the pgx sample , and @xmath21  with a tighter distribution in the simulated rm sample .",
    "this latter value is consistent with the average value of @xmath220.76 computed for the values of our edited park et al .",
    "( 2013 ) sample .",
    "taking into account that our pgx subsample is not totally complete and only 22 objects , and that we have had to edit the vp06 and park et al .",
    "( 2013 ) samples slightly , which are each only 23 objects , and that matching those samples can only be done approximately , we prefer to be quantitatively conservative .",
    "the zero - point offset @xmath14  in the fwhm - based c  iv black hole scaling relationship derived using rm samples differs from that obtained for the pgx sample , and will yield masses that are systematically high by almost @xmath190.2 dex or @xmath1950% .",
    "there is a similar bias for @xmath8-based c  iv masses , which is smaller but on the same order .",
    "we are now entering an era of identifying first and second - order corrections to se quasar black hole scaling relationships . real line profiles are complex and do not seem to always represent gas moving in a purely virial manner .",
    "moreover , accuracy and precision are both important , and efforts must be made not only to reduce scatter in scaling relationships , but also to get the zero point right .",
    "specifically , which measurements should be made to yield the best black hole masses ?",
    "for instance , is the choice of measuring @xmath5v using fwhm or @xmath8 preferred ?",
    "a number of articles have suggested that the latter may be a better choice ( e.g. collin et al .",
    "we have shown here @xmath8-based masses also suffer an ev1 bias .",
    "the @xmath8-based masses can be also biased when measured using spectra with low signal - to - noise ( snr ) ratios ( e.g. denney et al 2013 ) .",
    "thus fwhm , being a more robust measurement for typical lower snr quasar spectra from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , e.g. , shen et al .",
    "2011 ) is likely preferred in that case .",
    "working on fwhm - based scaling relationships is therefore valuable even if @xmath8 may be a less biased measurement in high - snr spectra .      if an investigator wants the best black hole mass with only rest - frame ultraviolet spectra of low or moderate snr , what is the best course to take ?",
    "if the object is in the sdss data release 7 , they can adopt the shen et al .",
    "( 2012 ) values already given to them , based on the vp06 prescription , but increase the value by 0.2 dex or 50% to take into account the typical ev1 bias .",
    "if they want to improve on that average ev1 correction , they can make additional measurements of the peak heights of the @xmath01400 feature and c  iv and apply equation 3 of paper 1 .",
    "this is also a reasonable course for updating any c  iv based masses already in use that were computed using vp06 formulations .",
    "this is probably not ideal , however , given the changes between the work of vp06 and that of park et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , who made many small improvements that together led to significantly different c  iv scaling relationships .",
    "an average correction for ev1 bias can still be applied , increasing masses by @xmath1950% .",
    "if measurements of the peaks of @xmath01400 feature and c  iv can be made , then a better , individualized correction is possible :    @xmath28    the above equation assumes the paper 1 slope on the ev1 term and a rm sample mean of log peak @xmath01400/c  iv of @xmath220.76 .",
    "while we have provided a second decimal place on the numbers in the equation , we recommend rounding results to only the first decimal place .",
    "we suggest the paper 1 slope ( @xmath29 rather than @xmath30 ) because the previous analysis does not bin data which can have a small effect on the fitted slope , and note that the larger uncertainty is the result of conservative errors on individual points compared to the actual scatter in the data points that we used for the subsamples .",
    "this equation also assumes that our ev1 correction does not change for higher luminosity , higher redshift quasars , but this should be explicitly and quantitatively investigated .",
    "the correction could change if the `` baldwin effect '' ( baldwin 1977 ) , the inverse correlation between emission line equivalent width and continuum luminosity , differs between c  iv and the @xmath01400 feature , or if it differs between the contaminating ilr component and the rest of the c  iv emission line .",
    "shang et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found that the narrower line core of c  iv correlated with luminosity in the sense of the baldwin effect , and therefore a dependence on luminosity seems plausible , if not likely .",
    "furthermore , at higher redshifts whatever unknown property or properties driving ev1 could differ from those in our lower redshift samples , or differ in their manifestation .",
    "it is not necessarily necessary to give up using rm samples to derive black hole mass scaling relationships . in principle",
    "such samples have the most reliable black hole masses and it is desirable to use them when possible .",
    "ideally , these samples can be expanded to include a larger range in ev1 , particularly objects at the narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) end of the trend at high values of peak @xmath01400/c  iv , that are currently underrepresented , at least in the case of also having rest - frame ultraviolet spectra covering the c  iv emission line . new ultraviolet _ hst _ spectroscopy of nls1s that have been reverberation mapped ( e.g. , du et al .",
    "2014 ) would be quite useful in expanding the sample of rm quasars with a wider range of ev1 properties .",
    "rm campaigns should , more generally , endeavour to include the full range of all types of broad - lined agns in order to avoid systemic biases of all types , and not just target the easiest and most cooperative objects .",
    "we must be concerned about some nls1s , however , given suspicions that the presence of extreme high - ionization winds emitting c  iv might prevent accurate mass estimation ( e.g. , vestergaard 2011 ) . additionally , the currently existing ev1 bias could result from a physical effect , that nls1s may not vary as strongly as other broad - lined seyfert galaxies and quasars ( e.g. , ai et al .",
    "2013 ) , making them more challenging targets for reverberation campaigns .",
    "another potential issue is that ev1 properties may result in biases of not only the c  iv derived masses , but of h@xmath17 derived masses .",
    "du et al . ( 2014 ) find that two of their nls1s with extremely high accretion rates have time lags significantly shorter than expected based on existing r@xmath4 - l relationships , which may lead to systematic overestimation of black hole masses for similar objects using existing h@xmath17 scaling relationships .",
    "a statistically larger number of reverberation - mapped agns is required to more fully investigate this result .    despite these caveats ,",
    "there is reason for optimism as improvements are clear and more can be expected in the future given these and other approaches .",
    "of particular interest is the new , large reverberation mapping effort described by shen et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , which promises to deliver dozens of new broad - line time lags for a homogeneously selected sample of quasars likely including the full range in ev1 .",
    "quasar black hole mass determinations will improve , and rm efforts are still needed to drive improvements .",
    "we have explicitly demonstrated how samples biased in uv probes ev1 produce biased black hole mass scaling relationships .",
    "we have also determined quantitatively the size of the effect and its general consistent with our previous work .",
    "we have shown how to make both average and individualized corrections to black hole masses estimated using the c  iv line based on equations derived from reverberation - mapped samples , which are popular but heterogeneous and biased in ev1 .",
    "they , on average , lead to mass estimates that are @xmath190.2 dex or about 50% too high .",
