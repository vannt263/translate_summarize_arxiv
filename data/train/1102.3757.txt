    "during the past decades , spin - based electronics has been a growing area of research due to its promising applications.@xcite among various electron systems , the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) has been widely studied in spin injection , spin relaxation , spin transport and spin hall effect , etc .. @xcite most of the 2deg systems are achieved in the semiconductor quantum wells or heterostructures.@xcite the strict 2deg , e.g. , the one existing in a graphene monolayer , also attracts much attention recently.@xcite besides , the 2deg has also been experimentally realized at the interface of insulating oxides such as laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0,@xcite opening the way for the oxide - based nanoelectronics .",
    "starting from this oxide heterostructure , very recently jia and berakdar proposed a trilayer system for new functionalities , which is grown as laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0/tbmno@xmath0 along the @xmath2-axis of orthorhombic tbmno@xmath0.@xcite as a multiferroic material , tbmno@xmath0 can exhibit both magnetic and electric orders simultaneously and provide a unique opportunity to exploit the multifunctionality of a single material.@xcite srtio@xmath0 in the middle of the trilayer system is a few layers thick so that the 2deg at the interface of laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 can be affected by the magnetic order in tbmno@xmath0 .",
    "based on this structure , jia and berakdar predicted the appearance of a persistent spin current in the 2deg due to the spiral geometry of the local magnetic order.@xcite they also proposed a flash memory model based on the claim that the injected spins in the 2deg have no decay of spin polarization along the @xmath3-axis when travelling along the @xmath4-axis.@xcite this claim was inferred@xcite from the fact that the spin polarization along the [ 110 ] direction does not decay in ( 001 ) gaas quantum - well - based 2deg with identical rashba@xcite and dresselhaus@xcite spin - orbit coupling strengths , in the _ absence _ of any external magnetic field.@xcite nevertheless , this claim is questionable in the 2deg formed at the interface of the oxide , because the local magnetic moments serve as a static magnetic field in the voigt configuration in the spiral frame@xcite and , as pointed out by weng and wu,@xcite a magnetic field in the voigt configuration can effectively suppress spin diffusion / transport even when the dyakonov - perel spin - orbit coupling@xcite is absent.@xcite in this work , we investigate the spin diffusion along the @xmath4-axis at the interface of laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 closely above tbmno@xmath0 by means of the kinetic spin bloch equation ( ksbe ) approach.@xcite it is found that the spin diffusion length is _ finite _ in spite of the spin polarization direction and the coulomb scattering makes marked effect on the spin relaxation in diffusion .",

    "[ haks ] , we give the hamiltonian of the 2deg in the collinear frame with @xmath5 parallel to the @xmath2-axis , and in the spiral frame with @xmath5 parallel to the local magnetic moment , respectively .",

    "the electron - impurity scattering is also neglected in the high - mobility 2deg ( for electron density @xmath58  @xmath59 and mobility @xmath60  @xmath61/(v@xmath62s),@xcite the impurity density is calculated to be @xmath63  @xmath59 , corresponding to which the electron - impurity scattering is found to be negligible ) .",
    "the scattering left in our consideration is the electron - electron coulomb scattering , which has been proved to be important in spin relaxation and spin transport in semiconductors.@xcite the detailed expression of the coulomb scattering can be found in ref .  .",
    "by solving the ksbes one obtains the spin diffusion properties from @xmath64 , the steady - state distribution of density matrices .",
    "equation  ( [ hk ] ) is analogous to the spin - orbit coupling in ( 001 ) gaas quantum - well - based 2deg with identical rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling strengths ( only the linear dresselhaus term is considered ) when @xmath25 is set to zero .",
    "there , when the @xmath42-axis is set along [ 1@xmath650 ] , the spin - orbit coupling reads @xmath66 , with @xmath67 being the coefficient of the rashba ( or dresselhaus ) spin - orbit coupling.@xcite therefore , if the spin polarization is along the @xmath29-axis , there is no spin precession and hence the spin relaxation is suppressed.@xcite however , the exchange interaction in oxide provides a static magnetic field @xmath25 along the @xmath68-axis in the spiral frame , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ hk ] ) .",
    "this field rotates the spin polarization away from the @xmath29-axis .",
    "the spin polarization away from the @xmath29-axis feels the inhomogeneous broadening,@xcite i.e. , the momentum - dependent spin - orbit coupling from the @xmath29-component of @xmath69 , which , together with any scattering , leads to irreversible spin relaxation.@xcite moreover , the effective magnetic field mixes spin relaxations along the @xmath42-@xmath68 plane to the one along the @xmath29-axis , similar to the case based on semiconductor quantum wells.@xcite therefore , the spin relaxation time along the @xmath29-axis is not infinite as claimed by jia and berakdar,@xcite neither does the spin relaxation along other directions .",
    "the above scenario also happens to ( 110 ) gaas quantum wells .",
    "the effective magnetic field induced by the dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling is oriented along the quantum - well growth direction when only the lowest subband is relevant , which leads to an infinite spin relaxation time when the spin polarization is along that direction . however , by applying a static magnetic field in the quantum - well plane , the spin relaxation time becomes finite.@xcite    to be quantitative , we numerically solve the ksbes in time domain@xcite with the coulomb scattering explicitly included . in fig .",
    "[ figzw1 ] , the time evolution of spin polarization ( with an initial value 5  % ) is plotted .",
    "it is clearly shown that when the initial spin polarization @xmath70 is along @xmath71 , the spin polarization relaxes when @xmath72 .",

    "however , when the scattering is included , the spin polarization will completely relax to zero during spin diffusion ( this will be shown later ) .",
    "moreover , the spatial distribution of spin polarization shows high - frequency oscillations when @xmath72 , as detailed in figs .",
    "[ figzw2](d)-(f ) in a smaller scale of @xmath46 .",

    "the corresponding results are shown in fig .",
    "[ figzw3 ] , where the high - frequency oscillations disappear and the spin polarization along the @xmath88-axis does not decay due to the absence of the inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "it is noted that the above decay of spin polarization along the spin diffusion in the absence of scattering is due to the interference effect.@xcite now we numerically solve the full ksbes with the coulomb scattering explicitly included , facilitated with the double - side injection boundary conditions.@xcite for the cases with @xmath72 , we plot @xmath115 as a function of position @xmath46 in fig .",
    "[ figzw4 ] .",
    "it is shown that the coulomb scattering effectively leads to the spin relaxation along the spin diffusion . by comparing figs .",
    "[ figzw4 ] and [ figzw2 ] , it is observed that with the scattering , the spin diffusion is suppressed along all directions.@xcite especially , the spin polarization along the @xmath116-axis relaxes to zero completely during the spin diffusion .",
    "it is also noted that the amplitude of the high - frequency oscillations shown in fig .",
    "[ figzw2 ] becomes much smaller .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the spin diffusion in a 2deg at the interface of oxide heterostructure laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 closely above the multiferroic tbmno@xmath0 by means of the ksbe approach . at low temperature ( @xmath117  k ) , mn@xmath1 magnetic moments in tbmno@xmath0 form a spiral order and couple with the 2deg via the heisenberg exchange interaction .",
    "it is found that in the presence of the spiral magnetic order , in contrast to the claims in the literature , the spin polarization decays during spin diffusion , despite the polarization direction of injected spins .",
