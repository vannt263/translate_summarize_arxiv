    "entanglement plays an important role in quantum information @xcite .",
    "an experimental system makes use of a certain maximally entangled state @xmath0 for realization of quantum information processing .",
    "however , a state generated as a maximally entangled state is not necessarily a true maximally entangled state because the entanglement is easily corrupted by interaction with the environment .",
    "hence , it is important to consider how well answer to the question ` is the state equal to @xmath0 ? ' using quantum measurement with two outcomes @xmath1 corresponding to ( yes , no ) .    for the practical use ,",
    "it is natural to restrict our measurements to local operation and classical communications ( locc ) because locc are easily implemented .",
    "since the result of the locc measurement is probabilistic and the error of incorrect answers is inevitable , it is important to consider an optimization problem of the measurement . as a framework of this argument",
    ", hypothesis testing is appropriate @xcite .",
    "we consider two hypotheses    @xmath2 : the state is @xmath0 versus @xmath3 : the state is not @xmath0 .    since @xmath2 is an accumulation point of @xmath3 , the probability of the correct answer ` @xmath2 is true ' when @xmath2 is really true is almost equal to the probability of the incorrect answer ` @xmath2 is true ' when the state is close to @xmath0 but different . in the hypothesis testing ,",
    "considering the two errors : + ( i ) to answer ` @xmath3 is true ' though @xmath2 is really true , + ( ii ) to answer ` @xmath2 is true ' though @xmath3 is really true , + we minimize the probability of ( ii ) with the probability of ( i ) kept small . see section 2 for details .",
    "there are similar studies based on entanglement witness ; a physical observable which gives minus outputs for a set of entangled inputs @xcite .",
    "the concept of entanglement witness is widely adopted , and there are many extensive arguments , especially , by making use of group symmetry .",
    "see , for example , theoretical works @xcite and experiments @xcite . however , in their arguments , analysis of statistical error is not sufficient .",
    "hence it is worth considering this problem in the style of statistical hypothesis testing @xcite . though there have been studies of quantum hypothesis testing @xcite , there have not been enough arguments for testing entanglement .    in this article , we give an approach to the hypothesis testing whether the state is @xmath0 using locc measurement between two parties and independent samples .",
    "we will derive optimal locc tests under some group invariance .",
    "the first case we consider is testing one sample of a pair of @xmath4-dimensional systems using locc between two parties . as a physical meaning ,",
    "the optimal test is equivalent to optimal teleportation using a given state partially entangled , and the error probability is the same as the fidelity of the input and the output of the teleportation .",
    "it is also found that the test is equivalent to the extreme points of locc measurement described by virmani and plenio @xcite and the entanglement witness given in @xcite .",
    "next , the result is generalized for the @xmath5-sample case .",
    "we derive an optimal test which is invariant by @xmath6 , and its asymptotic behavior ( @xmath7 ) . in the asymptotic sense ,",
    "the optimal locc test has the same performance as the optimal test without locc restriction .",
    "next , we present the main result of this article : for @xmath8 , the optimal test using locc between parties and independent samples , with @xmath9-invariance and some additional conditions or requirements .",
    "since these tests are characterized by invariant measure , it contains continuous operations , however , in order to implement it , they need their construction with finite basis .",
    "then , we show how to construct the optimal measurement with finite basis , for experimental realization .",
    "finally , we consider an optimal test using measurement non - local between samples with @xmath10-invariance .",
    "this test is equivalent to the entanglement swapping .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "a general formulation of hypothesis testing is introduced . in section 3 ,",
    "we state problems treated in this article . in section 4 , we consider a problem to test entanglement based on a single sample pair , and we derive an optimal test @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , we consider a case where there are @xmath5-independent pairs of samples to test entanglement . as a direct consequence of the previous section ,",
    "we derive an optimal locc test @xmath12 .",
    "it is also shown that this test has the same performance as the optimal test without locc restriction in an asymptotic sense .",
    "in section 5 , an optimal test @xmath13 is derived under an locc condition between ab - parties and between samples . in section 6 , an optimal test @xmath14",
    "is also derived under another condition which is less restrictive as for locality . in section 7 , we discretize the test derived in section 5 using representation of a finite groups . in section 8 ,",
    "we compare the performance of these tests for @xmath15 .",
    "the main subject of this article is to test whether a given state is    @xmath2 : the maximally entangled state @xmath0 or @xmath3 : any other state    using locc . to setup the hypothesis testing formally ,",
    "we first consider hypotheses @xmath2 and @xmath3 generally consisting of many elements .",
    "the hypothesis testing is an optimization problem with respect to error probability of a measurement with two outcomes corresponding to the two hypotheses .",
    "as described later , there are two error probabilities , and one of them will be minimized with the other one kept in a given small level .",
    "let @xmath16 be a finite - dimensional hilbert space which describes a physical system of interest .",
    "we denote the set of linear operators ( matrices ) on @xmath16 ( of density matrices on @xmath16 ) by @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively . in hypothesis testing",
    ", we assume two hypotheses the _ null hypothesis _ @xmath2 and the _ alternative hypothesis _ @xmath3 , and choose two non - empty subsets @xmath19 and @xmath20 of @xmath21 such that @xmath22 , which correspond to our hypotheses .",
    "suppose that the given state @xmath23 of the system is unknown and that @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "we test @xmath26 by a measurement with two outcomes @xmath27 : if the outcome @xmath28 is obtained , then we support the hypothesis @xmath29",
    ". however , the purpose of hypothesis testing is rejecting the null hypothesis @xmath2 and accepting @xmath3 with a given confidence level .",
    "hence , we make decision only when the outcome @xmath30 is observed , and we reserve our decision when the outcome @xmath31 is observed . for simplicity , the test , or the measurement , @xmath32",
    "is often described by @xmath31 . in the hypothesis testing , there are two kinds of errors : type 1 error is an event such that @xmath3 is accepted though @xmath2 is true .",
    "type 2 error is an event such that @xmath2 is accepted though @xmath3 is true .",
    "hence the type 1 error probability @xmath33 and the type 2 error probability @xmath34 are given by @xmath35 a test @xmath32 is said to be _",
    "when @xmath37 for any @xmath24 because @xmath36 expresses the confidence level of our decision .",
    "a quantity @xmath38 is called _ power_. in our main problem , we will consider level - zero tests only .",
    "the main problem of hypothesis testing is to maximize the power , or equivalently , to minimize the type 2 error probability , of the test @xmath32 of level-@xmath36 .",
    "a test @xmath32 of level-@xmath36 is said to be _ most powerful ( mp ) level-@xmath36 _ at @xmath25 if @xmath39 for any level-@xmath36 test @xmath40 .",

    "the ump test is regarded as the best test . however , except for some examples , there is no ump test because the uniformness is too strict .    in mathematical statistics",
    ", it is too difficult to solve problems when both @xmath19 and @xmath20 have plural elements , except for some special cases , for example , the classical bioequivalence problem @xcite .",
    "hence , it is natural to consider the case where @xmath41 or @xmath42 however , it is also too difficult to treat the above case .",
    "hence , we consider the case @xmath43 in this article .",
    "if any @xmath44 is invariant by an action of a group , e.g. , transposition of the order of independent samples , we can without loss of generality restrict attention to tests exhibiting the same invariance , because the error probabilities are invariant .",
    "we may also require that @xmath31 should be invariant by a group action leaving @xmath19 invariant to simplify the problem mathematically . in experiments of entanglement",
    ", only locc can be used , so it is required that the test is realized by locc .",
    "there is a trade - off between requirement and power of a test ; if there are two requirements @xmath45 and @xmath46 for a test and if @xmath45 is weaker than @xmath46 , then the optimal test for @xmath45 is more powerful than that for @xmath46 .",
    "if @xmath45 and @xmath46 are unitary - invariance conditions , arguments for @xmath46 tends to be mathematical easier .",
    "if they are locality conditions , arguments for @xmath46 tends to be more difficult . in the next section",

    "standard basis_.    since the state is invariant by transposing the order of independent samples , we can without loss of generality impose that the tests for each case should be invariant by the same transposition .",
    "we additionally impose three types of basic conditions on tests , that is , level - zero , locality and unitary invariance . among various level-@xmath36 conditions ,",
    "we adopt @xmath55 because it is the most fundamental and the optimal tests have analytically simple forms .",

    "first , we will make an locc test for a product system of two @xmath4-dimensional systems .",
