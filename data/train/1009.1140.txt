    "the fraction of the metagalactic ionizing background contributed by star  forming galaxies remains poorly constrained by direct measures at every cosmic epoch because of the difficulty of the observations .",
    "in particular , we do not have direct empirical determinations of how the fraction of escaping ionizing radiation depends on the properties of the galaxies , nor how it evolves with redshift .",
    "yet , the issue deserves attention , because it directly bears on fundamental problems of galaxy evolution , such as the evolution of the initial mass function ( imf ) and the contribution of galaxies to cosmic re - ionization .",
    "the latter problem is currently particularly timely since observations are starting to identify relatively large samples of galaxies at @xmath9 ( e.g. , bouwens et al .",
    "2010a , b ; finkelstein et al .",
    "2010 ; castellano et al .",
    "2010 ) , namely during the epoch when cosmic re - ionization is believed to have completed ( e.g. , fan et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the ultraviolet background ( uvb ) radiation can significantly affect galaxy evolution by photo - ionizing and heating the interstellar medium ( ism ) to @xmath10k thereby decreasing gas accretion onto low ",
    "mass galaxies and evaporating the existing gas in small haloes . deriving empirical constraints to the nature and evolution of the cosmic uvb , as well as the nature of ionizing sources , remains a primary goal of many observations .",
    "faucher - gigure et al .",
    "( 2008a ) analyzed the opacity of the lyman alpha forest ( laf ) of 86 high  resolution quasar ( qso ) spectra and found that the hydrogen photoionization rate @xmath11 is remarkably flat in the redshift range 2  4.2 .",
    "the quasar contribution to the hydrogen ionizing background increases toward @xmath12 as the peak of the quasar luminosity function is approached ( e.g. , hopkins et al .",
    "2007 ) ; beyond redshift 2 their contribution significantly decreases ( e.g. , fontanot et al . 2007 ; siana et al . 2008",

    "however , recent additional observations improve their constraints on the slope , bringing it into greater agreement with previous estimates and suggesting that qsos _ may not _ be sufficient to account for the ionizing photons ( glikman et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "star  forming galaxies are now known to exist numerously at these redshifts and are therefore the leading candidates to account for the remaining ionizing photons ( e.g. , siana et al .",
    "2008 ; faucher - gigure et al .",
    "2009 ) .    from the theoretical point of view , current predictions of the escape fraction of ionizing photons from high  redshift galaxies are confusing , with different results obtained by different simulations .",
    "for example , gnedin et al . (",
    "2008 ) argued that @xmath14 , i.e. , ratio of the flux density of lyman continuum ( lyc ) escaping from a galaxy to that produced in the galaxy , increases with increasing halo mass in the range of @xmath15 m@xmath16 , and their values of @xmath0 are mostly less than a few per cent .",
    "this is much lower than other published work ; for example , wise & cen ( 2009 ) predict @xmath17 .",
    "yajima et al . (",
    "2010 ) found an opposite behavior such that @xmath0 decreases with increasing halo mass , with an average @xmath18 for @xmath19 m@xmath16  dropping to @xmath20 for @xmath21 m@xmath16 .",
    "a similar result was also found by razoumov & sommer - larsen ( 2010 ) .",
    "it is clear that the physical processes that modulate the escaping ionizing photons are not well understood .    from the observational point of view",
    ", @xmath22 has been poorly constrained due to the fact that lyc photons are easily absorbed by both the igm and the interstellar medium in a galaxy .",
    "the best way to investigate the lyc emissivity from high  redshift galaxies is to perform deep spectroscopic or narrow - band observations focused on the peak of the lyc emission , e.g. , 880910  rest - frame .",

    "they showed that the mean value of @xmath28 for the 7 lbgs is 0.11 after correcting for dust extinction , and 0.20 if igm absorption is taken into account .",

    "since the strmgren sphere radius is only 250 kpc ( physical ) , the agn is not influencing the ib observation , or in other words , the source must ionize the igm at least down to redshift 3.386 to perturb the ib photometry ( @xmath72 ) , which clearly is not the case .",
    "its lyc detection is therefore most probably due to an intrinsically high transmission of the igm and/or escape fraction of ionizing radiation .",

    "once this @xmath58 spectroscopic sample of lbgs has been identified , it is interesting to address the following question : how many sources do we expect to detect at a given depth in the ib survey assuming a distribution function of @xmath0 ?    allowing redshift to vary from 3.3 to 4.5 , the ib filter probes rest - frame wavelengths far below 912  ( e.g. , down to @xmath73 ) , where the igm transmission decreases rapidly to zero because of the increasing probability of intercepting lyman limit systems and damped ly@xmath33  systems ( hereafter llss and dlas , respectively ) as well as the decreasing free path of ionizing photons ( see next section ) .",
    "it is therefore necessary to estimate the expected lyc signal in our ib image adopting a model of the igm transmission .",

    "therefore , the absorption of the lyman continuum is mainly caused by llss and dlas with @xmath88 @xmath89 and not by the laf , which has @xmath90 @xmath89 .",
    "this implies that lyc absorption is very stochastic because it is related to the probability of intercepting a lls .    in this work",
    "the intergalactic absorption derived from the monte carlo simulations of inoue & iwata ( 2008 ) is adopted ( iw08 hereafter ) .",
    "briefly , we recall the main steps . the simulations are based on an empirical distribution function of intergalactic absorbers which reproduces the observational statistics of the laf , llss and dlas simultaneously . from this assumed distribution function ,",
    "a large number of absorbers have been generated ( running suitable monte carlo simulations ) along many lines of sight .",
    "the probability to encounter an absorber is assumed to follow a poisson distribution , and for each one the column density and doppler parameter are extracted randomly from their ( empirical ) probability distribution functions . typically @xmath24 18,000 absorbers are generated for a line of sight in the redshift interval @xmath91 ( this number depends on the lower limit to the column density ) .",
    "as described in detail in iw08 , 10,000 lines of sight have been calculated in the redshift interval @xmath92 with step @xmath93=0.1 .",
    "the resulting mean intergalactic transmission is comparable to that derived by meiksin ( 2006 ) in the lyman series regime ( @xmath43 912 ) , though the iw08 transmission are slightly lower in the lyc regime .",

    "this is shown in figure  [ trans ] , where the medians and 68% confidence interval of the transmissions of 10,000 different lines of sight calculated in the redshift range 3.44.5 are reported ( the averages are also shown as open squares ) .",
    "the distributions are not symmetric because of intervening llss and dlas .",
    "the transmissions have been convolved with the ib filter shape ; therefore , they are calculated in the suitable wavelength interval covered by the filter at a given redshift . for comparison ,",
    "the median transmissions calculated in the wavelength range 880 - 910  is also shown ( it is identical to that reported in figure 8 of iw08 ) .",
    "clearly the transmissions calculated through the ib filter are systematically lower than the `` optimal '' case ( 880 - 910 ) .",
    "this is fully taken into account in the simulations we describe in the following section .",
    "we note that at redshifts beyond 4.0 , the intergalactic absorption strongly attenuates the ionizing flux .",
    "we briefly note the recent findings of prochaska et al .",

    "qualitatively , if these results are correct then the transmission of the igm derived here is underestimated ; i.e. , the number of expected lyc detections in our ib survey would increase , and given the observational constraint of only one out of 102 lbgs detected , this would imply that the upper limits we derive for @xmath22 are further strengthened ( see next section ) .",

    "the upper limits on the ( mean ) escaping ionizing radiation @xmath22 span the range 4% to 60% .",
    "the values derived from the monte carlo simulations are consistent with this interval , in particular if the brighter ( large magnitude contrast ) and lower redshift ( higher igm transmission ) objects are considered in the grouping ( see table  [ tab : fesc ] ) . compared to the estimations appearing in the literature so far ,",
    "these are the most constraining results on @xmath22 in the redshift and magnitude range here considered .    as discussed at the end of sect .",
    "4.1 , it is worth noting the effect of the recent findings of prochaska et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and songaila & cowie ( 2010 ) about the lower incidence of llss observed with respect to previous work ( e.g. , proux et al . 2005 ; also adopted in this work ) . assuming these results to be correct , they imply a higher igm transmission by a factor of 1.5 ( this has been done by rescaling the predictions of iw08 to match the number of llss reported in those works ) .",
    "therefore , the limits we report in the above equation would further decrease by the same factor ( eq .  [ eq : stack1 ] )",
    ". the same dimming factor would also apply to the upper limits reported in table  [ tab : fesc ] .",
    "the number of available sources of the @xmath58 sample in the fors1 nb imaging is 30 .",
    "there are two more lbgs in this sample ( not considered in the ib calculations ) since the nb imaging starts to probe the lyc at redshift beyond 3.3 ( not 3.4 as for the ib ) .",
    "none of the lbgs show a lyc detection at s / n@xmath642 , and again no detection is measured in the median ( average ) stacking .",
    "while the nb observations have the disadvantage of having smaller statistics and being shallower than the ib imaging , the narrow wavelength window helps to increase the average transmission of the igm if a suitable selection in redshift is done ( the limits calculated from the whole sample do not add any further constraint with respect to the ib derivations ) .",
    "indeed , selecting sources with redshift below 3.65 , the average transmission turns out to be 0.2 and the probed rest - frame wavelengths span the interval 843 - 890 .",
    "as above , an intrinsic luminosity ratio of @xmath113 = 7 is adopted ( see sect .",
    "eight galaxies match the selection @xmath153 and @xmath7  @xmath154 , with averages @xmath155=3.5 @xmath57 0.1 and @xmath144@xmath7@xmath145=24.6 @xmath57 0.4 . in the average process",
    "the one sigma lower limit of the flux ratio probed ( magnitude nb@xmath2429 ) is @xmath156=161 , which translates to an upper limit on @xmath22 of 12% assuming an intrinsic ratio of 7 and the same dust extinction a1500 adopted for the ib stacking ( it is @xmath104 of 22% ) . as discussed in the previous section adopting the correction factors for the transmission of songaila & cowie ( 2010 ) and prochaska et al .",
    "( 2010 ) these limits would be lowered .",

    "it is worth noting that , given the observed global non - detection here reported , a higher transmission of the igm ( prochaska et al .",
    "2010 ) would imply an even tighter constraint on the escaping radiation and therefore less contribution by ( bright ) lbgs .",
    "if galaxies only partially contribute , the remaining fraction presumably is provided by qsos .",

    "yajima et al .",

    "one of their primary conclusions was that , in the redshift interval @xmath170 , galaxies become the main contributor to igm ionization with the average ( standard deviation ) of the escape fraction of ionizing radiation increasing to @xmath3 40% ( 20% ) for low mass haloes , @xmath171 m@xmath16 .",
    "for the larger haloes , @xmath172 m@xmath16 , they predict an average @xmath22 of 7% with a relatively small scatter , less than 20% ( see their figure 2 ) , in agreement with what we find here .",
    "sources at the fainter end of the magnitude distribution are under  represented in our simulations , since the magnitude contrast reached between the ionizing and non - ionizing radiation ( ib and @xmath7  ) is smaller . however ,",

    "we have selected a sample of 218 galaxies with photometric redshifts in the range @xmath179 and magnitude @xmath180 @xmath7@xmath181 extracted from the public photometric redshift catalog of coe et al .",
    "ib photometry has been performed at the positions of the galaxies in the four aperture diameters , as was done for the spectroscopic sample .",
    "twenty - six out of 218 have a detection with s / n ratio higher than 2 in the 1.2  diameter aperture ; figure  [ cleanpanobpz ] shows their ib cutouts and the list is reported in table  [ sample_bpz ] .",
    "five out of 26 show an ib emission aligned with the lbg position ( marked with black crosses in figure  [ cleanpanobpz ] ) . in the other cases",
    "an offset is present and the lbg may suffer contamination by foreground sources .    from monte carlo simulations of the sample considered here we find that the expected median number of lyc detections at the 2@xmath41 ib depth is @xmath182 and @xmath183 for the case of constant and gaussian distributions with median @xmath22=1.0 and 0.7 , respectively .",
    "exponential and log - normal distributions predicts a comparable number ( @xmath184 ) if the median of the @xmath22 distributions is larger than 60% .",
    "this result is quantitatively consistent with the expectations if @xmath22 increases for less luminous galaxies .",
    "however , we stress that apart from the reduced magnitude contrast probed , the main disadvantage concerning these fainter sources is the reliance on photometric redshifts .",
    "if the sample includes some galaxies with true redshifts @xmath185 , the ib image would include light from wavelengths longward of the lyman limit .",
    "exploiting the ultra - deep vimos ib and deep fors1 nb imaging of the goods - south field , new limits on the escape fraction of ionizing radiation from star - forming galaxies at redshift 3.44.5 have been derived .",
    "particular care has been devoted to clean the spectroscopic sample from foreground contamination and agn contributions . from a sample of 102 lbgs",
    "we derive the following results :    1 .   from monte carlo simulations and stacking of the ib and nb imaging , we find that @xmath22 of @xmath1 lbg is distributed with a median lower than 5 - 6% and 84 percentile scatter lower than 20% in all the distributions investigated ( gaussian , exponential and log - normal ) .",
    "we note that the low upper limit on the median escape fraction is for the entire sample , independent of spectral properties . if the recent findings of prochaska et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and songaila & cowie ( 2010 ) are considered  i.e. , the average igm transmission is higher than that adopted here  then the limits we derive are further strengthened .",
    "one star - forming galaxy is detected in its lyc region at 700835  rest - frame .",
    "it is the highest redshift galaxy with such a detection currently known and is most probably due to a combination of high igm transmission coupled with a relatively high @xmath22 .",
    "the lower limit on @xmath22 is 15% ; assuming @xmath22=100% , the igm transmission can not be lower than 15% .",
    "this value is higher than the expected average value at this redshift ( 2.2% ) , implying that it is a particularly free line of sight .",
    "the galaxy shows a blue uv  continuum spectral slope ( @xmath65=@xmath502.1 ) and weak or absent interstellar absorption lines in the spectrum even though ly@xmath33  is in absorption .",

    "( 2005 ) or faucher - gigure et al .",
    "( 2008b ) , star - forming galaxies contribute partially ( @xmath186 ) to the required ultraviolet ionizing budget if @xmath22 is constant and equal to 5%",
    ". on one hand , the contribution of qsos may still be significant at the redshifts considered here , providing the ionizing fraction missed by galaxies .",
    "this strongly depends on the faint - end slope of the qso luminosity function ( glikman et al .",
    "2010 , and in preparation ) .",
    "on the other hand , several works suggest that the qso contribution to the uvb decreases significantly beyond redshift 2 , reaching fractions lower than 50% ( down to 10% ) at redshift 4 ( e.g. , fontanot et al .",
    "2007 ; siana et al . 2008 ; faucher - gigure et al . 2008b ; prochaska et al .",
    "in this case galaxies would provide almost all of the ionizing radiation , which , as we have seen , requires that @xmath22 depends on the uv luminosity .",
    "we remind , however , that these conclusions depend on both the total ionizing uvb and the qso fractional contribution to it , quantities remain empirically poorly constrained at these redshifts .",
    "if @xmath22 does indeed depend on the uv luminosity , then we can speculate on the following scenario .",
    "bouwens et al .",
    "( 2009b ) , analyzing samples of lbgs in the redshift range @xmath170 show that there is a clear correlation between the uv  continuum slope @xmath65 and ultraviolet luminosity . in particular , for the @xmath187band dropout sample also adopted here ,",
    "more luminous lbgs have redder colors .",
    "moreover , it is known from stacking tens and hundreds of lbg spectra at redshift 35 that the redder uv - continuum slopes are linked to low ly@xmath33  equivalent widths and stronger interstellar absorption lines , while ly@xmath33 emitters are bluer and have weaker interstellar absorption lines ( e.g. , shapley et al .",
    "2003 ; pentericci et al .",
    "2007 ; vanzella et al . 2009 ; balestra et al . 2010 ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath22 is , on average , larger in galaxies with fainter uv luminosity then we would expect that the bulk of the ionizing radiation comes from faint ly@xmath33  emitters , which are , in general , younger and less massive than their brighter lbg counterparts ( e.g. , ono et al .",

    ", this would be plausible and possible cases have been found by iwata et al .",
    "( 2009 ) . on the other hand , we have shown an opposite example , in which lyc emission arises from a lbg without ly@xmath33  in emission ( even though it has been detected in the bright @xmath188 regime ) .",

    "<S> if this result remains valid for fainter lbgs down to current observational limits , then the lbg population might be not sufficient to account for the entire photoionization budget at the redshifts considered here , with the exact details dependent upon the assumed ionizing background and qso contribution thereto . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that @xmath0 depends on the uv luminosity of the galaxies , with fainter galaxies having higher @xmath0 , and estimates of @xmath0 from a sample of faint lbg from the hudf ( @xmath7@xmath8 ) are in broad quantitative agreement with such a scenario .    </S>",
