    "neutrinos coming from a source propagate through the earth , occasionally producing upward - going muons by charged - current interactions with the matter surrounding the detector .",

    "[ macrosci ] we discuss the capability of the macro detector as a neutrino telescope . in particular , since most of events induced by astrophysical neutrinos are expected in the 0.1 - 100 tev energy range , the response of scintillation counters was accurately studied for high energy events , using the scintillator calibrations . in sec",

    "liquid scintillator layers , placed at the bottom , the center , the top and all around the detector provided time information for discriminating the direction of incoming particles .",
    "the horizontal streamer tube planes were equipped with pick - up strips providing stereo read - out of the detector hits . the large acceptance ( @xmath57 10@xmath58 m@xmath59 sr for an isotropic flux ) , the good shielding of the site ( the rate of cosmic ray muons is @xmath57 10@xmath60 times the surface rate ) , the fast timing ( time resolution @xmath61 ns ) and the good pointing capability ( intrinsic angular resolution @xmath62 ) made macro suitable for working as a neutrino _",
    "telescope_.      the energy deposited in a macro scintillation counter by a throughgoing particle is reconstructed by the erp ( energy reconstruction processor ) system according to the procedure described in  @xcite .",
    "the erp circuit uses a twelve - bit adc that makes an accurate integration of the photomultiplier pulse .",
    "this is applied to both the raw signal and a 10@xmath63 attenuated version ; the latter was used when the non attenuated adc saturates , i.e. for fast magnetic monopole searches  @xcite and in this analysis .",
    "the erp provides also time of flight from two tdcs readout .",
    "the erp adcs and tdcs were calibrated weekly with delayed led signals and variable - intensity laser pulses .",

    "this hypothesis is valid for most of the analyses based on macro data .    the present analysis deals with signals greatly exceeding the average energy released in the detector by downward - going cosmic ray muons and atmospheric neutrino - induced events .",
    "if the energy released in a counter exceeds 4@xmath675 times the level of that released by minimum ionizing cosmic ray muons ( @xmath68 mev for one vertical track crossing a horizontal scintillation counter ) , the phototube response is not linear anymore  @xcite .",
    "the effect of photomultiplier saturation can be taken into account by including in eq .",

    "1 ) . the corrections act only at large values of released energy @xmath76 , while around the distribution maximum their effect is negligible . ignoring the photomultiplier non - linearity leads to a systematic underestimate of the reconstructed energy loss for a small fraction of high energy events .",
