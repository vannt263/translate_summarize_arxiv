    "in 1982 , colombeau introduced an algebra @xmath0 of generalized functions to deal with the multiplication problem for distributions , see colombeau @xcite .",
    "this algebra @xmath0 is a differential algebra which contains the space @xmath1 of distributions .",
    "furthermore , nonlinear operations more general than the multiplication make sense in the algebra @xmath0 .",
    "therefore the algebra @xmath0 is a very convenient one to find and study solutions of nonlinear differential equations with singular data and coefficients .",
    "consider the mixed problem for the linear hyperbolic system in two variables @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are @xmath6 matrices whose terms are discontinuous functions .",
    "the matrix @xmath7 is real and diagonal such that @xmath8 in the case where @xmath9 and @xmath10 , multiplicative products of distributions appear in system  , and so there is no general way of giving a meaning to system in the sense of distribution .",
    "this hyperbolic system even when it is in the form of a system of conservation laws does not admit any solutions distributions in general see @xcite . our approach is to study in colombeau s algebra @xcite , and under some hypotheses on @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the system admits an unique solution in @xmath13 .",
    "this result completes work already made in the global case by m. oberguggenberger @xcite .",
    "the second part of this article , we will apply this result to the wave propagation problem in a discontinuous environment .",
    "the following system @xmath14 with @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 are real constants , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are continuous almost everywhere .    for this problem one can find a classical solution on @xmath20 and @xmath21 , so imposing a transmission condition in @xmath22 : the continuity of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , one will have a classical solution on @xmath25 .",
    "further if @xmath26 are generalized functions , one can show that the problem has a unique solution @xmath27 , without having us need of the passage conditions , in the same way one shows that this solution admits an associated distribution that is equal to the classical solution by adjusting .",
    "we recall some definitions from the theory of generalized functions which we need in the sequel .",
    "we define the algebra @xmath28 as follows @xmath29 and @xmath30 let @xmath31 $ ] be the set of functions on @xmath32 with values in @xmath33 witch are @xmath34 to seconde variable",
