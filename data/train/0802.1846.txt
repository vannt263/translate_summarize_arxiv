    "the importance of isolated early - type galaxies in understanding galaxy and cluster evolution has led to a surge in the available number of catalogues of such objects ( e.g colbert et al .",

    "2004 , denicolo et al .",
    "2005 , buote 2005 ) , with few galaxies in common between them .",
    "the variation arises from the different selection criteria used in the catalogue construction .",
    "a common requirement is that there is no galaxy with a similar redshift within a certain distance , typically of the order of 1 mpc .",
    "however , the incompleteness of current galaxy catalogues , and in particular the lack of complete redshift information , usually requires a visual inspection of the field as final confirmation that the galaxies are isolated .",
    "the catalogue of smith et al .",
    "( 2004 , hereafter smg ) only used redshift information for the central galaxy and discounted any galaxies which had a bright galaxy nearby in projection .",
    "it thus contains the strictest isolation criteria and all galaxies in the sample are the most dominant member in the field by at least 2.2 magnitudes within 500 kpc and 0.7 magnitudes within 1 mpc . again",
    ", visual inspection confirmed that these galaxies were indeed isolated .",
    "the smg catalogue will miss several galaxies in the other samples as no redshift information is applied .",
    "however , interpretation of the local faint galaxy environment is simplified by the lack of other bright galaxies nearby which may have their own dwarf population .    , an 11.9 @xmath3-magnitude ( @xmath4=8.1 ) e3-e4 galaxy at a distance of approximately 64 mpc ( ned and using @xmath5 )",
    "was included in the sample of smg due to the large magnitude difference between it and other nearby galaxies , even though it is often quoted as being at the centre of a loose group containing a number of ngc - catalogued galaxies together with several other fainter galaxies .",
    "denicolo et al .",
    "( 2005 ) classify it as a field elliptical rather than isolated .",
    "the brightest galaxy within a projected distance of 1 mpc is ngc1594 , a 13.9 @xmath3-magnitude ( @xmath4=10.2 ) galaxy at least 800 kpc away .",
    "the two closest ngc galaxies , ngc1601 and ngc1603 at separations of 1.6 and 2.6 arcminutes ( 30 kpc and 48 kpc ) respectively , are both almost three magnitudes fainter than .",
    "thus , although there are several neighbouring galaxies in the field of , it is by far the dominant galaxy in the group .",
    "there is a poor group of galaxies ( zwicky cluster 0430.8 - 0424b , zwicky et al .",
    "1961 - 1968 ) at a distance of 53 arcmin to the north of , with a mean velocity of 5030 @xmath6 ( baiesi - pillastrini et al .",
    "1984 ) , a velocity similar to that of ( 4715 @xmath7 ) .",
    "the brightest galaxy in this group still satisfies the isolation criteria of smg , i.e. it is more than 2.2 magnitudes fainter than .",
    "the galaxy has been the subject of several previous studies . in a photometric study",
    ", matthias and gerhard ( 1999 ) found the galaxy to have boxy isophotes , whilst kinematic studies ( bender et al .",
    "1994 , faber et al .",
    "1989 ) found that there was little rotation in the stellar component , with a maximum of 30 @xmath6 , whilst the central velocity dispersion is typical of larger elliptical galaxies ( 321 @xmath6 ) .",
    "there is evidence of past and possible ongoing star formation , with the presence of h@xmath8 regions ( trinchieri and di serego alighieri 1991 ) and dust ( ferrari et al .",
    "thus it is highly likely that is a merger remnant ( matthias and gerhard 1999 ) although , with broadband colours typical of elliptical galaxies ( ned ) , then this merger is likely to have occurred a long time ago .",
    "estimates of the age of this galaxy hence range from 4.6 gyr up to 8.8 gyr ( trager et al .",
    "2000 , terlevich and forbes 2002).these results are in agreement with the study of a sample of isolated early - type galaxies by reda et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who found that several galaxies had boxy isophotes , evidence of dust and past merger activity but had remained relatively dormant for several gigayears .",
    "is also a weak x - ray source ( sivakoff et al .",
    "2004 ) , showing extended emission out to at least 100 arcsec ( corresponding to a physical radius of 30 kpc , with a possible central component associated with and an outer emission region associated with the group .",
    "the extended outer emission is centred to the north - east of the central galaxy , suggesting that the centre of the potential is slightly offset from .",
    "the presence of extended material around the galaxy is also suggested from the tailed x - ray structure around the nearby galaxy ngc1603 , indicating an effect of ram - pressure stripping .",
    "the large magnitude difference between and the other galaxies in its neighbourhood , together with the extended x - ray emission , would suggest that may be a fossil group .    whereas the radius of about 200 arcsec , or 60 kpc , total soft x - ray emission of @xmath9 and absolute magnitude of @xmath10 indicate that this galaxy does not satisfy the criteria to be a fossil group , as stated by jones et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , it is worthwhile remarking that in recent work by santos et al ( 2007 ) some cases of fossil groups are identified which resemble some of the group properties .",
    "moreover , detailed studies by mendes de oliveira et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and cypriano et al ( 2006 ) have measured properties of fossil groups that make them more similar to clusters than was initially expected . to distinguish between the various possible evolutionary scenarios ( rich group , fossil group or isolated galaxy ) a more detailed investigation of the potential around",
    "is thus necessary .    in a similar technique to that used by zaritsky et al .",
    "( 1993,1997 ) , it is possible to use the dynamics of the fainter galaxies to derive an estimate of the size and mass of the central potential .",
    "this should enable us to distinguish between the isolated or cluster hypotheses for the description of .",
    "from the dynamics of galaxies in groups , estimates of their mass are typically of the order of @xmath11 ( e.g. parker et al . , 2005 ) whilst spiral galaxies have masses an order of magnitude smaller , even allowing for any dark matter component at large radii ( e.g. zaritsky et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the radii of groups is also an order of magnitude greater than that of the individual galaxies themselves ( e.g. karachentsev 2005 )",
    ". the mass and extent of elliptical galaxies is at present very uncertain , with x - ray evidence that some are surrounded by dark matter haloes ( e.g. fukazawa et al .",
    "2006 ) whilst optical evidence may suggest not , with masses similar to that of spiral galaxies ( e.g. romanowsky et al .",
    "however , the large difference between the likely mass and extent of galaxy groups compared to isolated galaxies should enable us to distinguish between the group - member and the isolated elliptical hypotheses for through a dynamical study of the other neighbouring galaxies .",
    "the presence of x - ray emission around can provide an estimate of the total mass of the galaxy , assuming hydrostatic equilibrium within the gas .",
    "fukazawa et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , analyzing chandra observations of a number of elliptical galaxies , determined a mass - to - light ratio for , at the effective radius of 14.5 kpc , of 10.58@xmath12 , corresponding to a total mass of approximately @xmath13 .",
    "this is higher than that of many galaxies in their sample .",
    "an investigation of the spatial distribution of galaxies around may also help in distinguishing between the isolated and group hypotheses .",
    "smg found a weak excess of galaxies around isolated elliptical galaxies out to at least 500 kpc , with an exponential slope of @xmath14 .",
    "this is similar to that found for poor groups and around individual galaxies but is less steep than that found for clusters ( e.g. hansen et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the number density of bright galaxies around isolated galaxies , however , is much lower than that found around groups and clusters .",
    "to obtain an estimate of the radial number density profile of galaxies around we have used the apm scans of ukst sky survey plates of a circular area of radius 1.5 degrees ( corresponding to a scale of 1.65 mpc at the distance of ) surrounding this galaxy .",
    "only those objects brighter than 20th magnitude in @xmath3 and classified as galaxies in both @xmath3 and @xmath15 were selected . lies within 1 degree of the edge of plate 764 in the survey and thus the adjoining plate , 765 , must be matched in both position and magnitude . using the topcat package in the starlink suite of astronomical data reduction packages we have used the matching objects detected by the apm in the overlap region of plate 764 and 765 to determine the accuracy of matching both in magnitude and position .",
    "the average magnitude difference between galaxies that lie in the overlap region that are detected in both plates is less than 0.05 magnitudes and thus no magnitude difference is assumed .",
    "in addition , the number of matched objects varies by less than 5% with varying the angular distance between 1 and 10 arcsec for those objects which are classified as matched .",
    "this indicates that the positional accuracy of the scans is less than 1 arcsec .",
    "however , due to several errors such as misclassification , vignetting and magnitude errors for bright galaxies , inconsistencies will arise between the galaxy sample derived from each plate , even though the mean density is almost identical and the magnitudes and positions agree for duplicate objects .",
    "the plates can not therefore be merged as this leads to an increase in the number density of galaxies within the overlap region .",
    "thus , to overcome this problem and reduce vignetting problems at the edge of the plate , half the overlap region was taken from plate 764 and half from plate 765 .",
    "the apm scans , as in all automatic object detection methods , have difficulty with not only star - galaxy separation at faint magnitudes but also the correct selection of objects within the haloes of bright stars and galaxies .",
    "for example , diffraction spikes are quite often split into several individual objects and their non - circular nature often leads to such structure being classified as non - stellar .",
    "there are several bright stars with diffraction spikes on the ukst plates of the field around .",
    "these are not in the immediate neighbourhood of the central galaxy .",
    "however , to ensure that the effect of misclassification and extraneous objects was insignificant we have overlain the positions of the objects detected by the apm over the ukst image for a visual inspection of the detected objects .",
    "no objects were found corresponding to diffraction spikes from bright stars . the star - galaxy separation technique used by the apm is also not 100% accurate and is heavily dependent upon the magnitude of the objects , becoming highly significant beyond @xmath16 ( e.g. maddox et al . 1990 ) .",
    "thus although it is likely that some objects are mis - classified , by limiting the sample to @xmath16 the percentage of misclassifications is small and this is confirmed by a visual inspection of the detected objects .",
    "a study of the detected objects superimposed on the ukst sky survey plates showed that several of the bright galaxies in the field of were not in the catalogue derived from the apm scans .",
    "many of these objects were classified as merged objects by the apm . to estimate the effect of these missed galaxies on the determination of the radial number density profile",
    ", these objects were added by eye , discounting faint objects that the eye has difficulty classifiying and that may also fail the magnitude cut - off .",
    "this subjective technique introduces more errors into the analysis but will lead to some estimate of the true errors in the apm number densities .    for the dynamical study ,",
    "all galaxies within a 25 arcminute radius of were selected from the apm catalogue ( e.g. lewis and irwin 1996 ) of the ukst survey plates .",
    "each object had to be detected as a galaxy in both @xmath3 and @xmath15 to be selected and a further visual check was made to ensure the correct identification as a galaxy .",
    "a magnitude cut of @xmath17 was made to facilitate the possibility of getting a redshift . as mentioned above ,",
    "several bright galaxies were not in the apm galaxy catalogue due to misclassification and these were added to the sample by hand .    the field was observed during the nights of 7th january 2003 and 12th january 2005 using the autofib2/wyffos multi - fibre spectrograph on the 4.2-m william herschel telescope ( wht ) on the island of la palma . during",
    "the 2003 run the large , 2.7arcsec , fibres were used to maximise the signal from the extended sources whereas in 2005 only the small , 1.6 arcsec , fibres were available .",
    "additionally , in 2003 the ccd used only enabled 120 fibres to be used whilst in 2005 the ccd had been replaced by a two 2k x 2k eev ccd mosaic enabling the number of fibres available for objects to be increased to 150 .",
    "the smaller ccd used in 2003 suffered from contamination of neighbouring spectra when bright objects were observed .",
    "as most of the galaxies observed here were faint this was not a significant problem .    the @xmath18 program was used to configure the observations , with the brighter galaxies , and those galaxies within the un - vignetted field of 20 arcminutes radius , preferentially selected for observation . with the limitations imposed by the instrument it was impossible to observe all galaxies in the field during one run .",
    "at least 4 stars in the field were selected for guiding through the fiducial bundles , and unused fibres were placed on areas of the background field for sky - subtraction .",
    "the data from the 2003 run were reduced and the galaxies for which no redshift was obtained , together with a selection of previously unobserved galaxies , were selected for the 2005 run . on both runs ,",
    "a wavelength range of approximately 3850  to 5450  was covered , with a pixel size of 0.4 .",
    "wavelength calibration was warranted by frequent observations of a neon and helium arc .",
    "seeing during the 2003 run was typically about 1 arcsec and a total of 5400 seconds integration time was obtained on the field . in 2005",
    "the seeing was 1.4 arcsec on average with 7200 seconds of integration on the field .",
    "due to the arrangement of the fibres on the spectrograph , the observed spectra are not uniformly placed on the ccd but are arranged in rows of 3 , with a shift of 60 pixels in the dispersion direction between three consecutive fibres .",
    "this leads to complications in the data reduction and so the data were reduced using the observatory - supplied wyffosreduc iraf package .",
    "this package bias - subtracts , extracts the fibres , and subtracts the sky in an automated fashion .",
    "however , to ensure the reduction was satisfactory , each step was visually checked .",
    "as the sky - subtraction in this package is not ideal inspections of the spectra were made to ensure satisfactory sky subtraction , with regions around possible sky emission lines removed .",
    "redshifts were obtained using the iraf xcsao package , with cross - correlation against a range of templates .",
    "figure 1 shows the radial number density profile of galaxies centred on estimated from the apm scans of the ukst sky survey plates of the region . there is a decline in the number density with radius and a strong suggestion that the background population has been reached at a radius of about 1.3 mpc .",
    "the errors displayed are calculated assuming poissonian statistics and are thus are likely to be an underestimate .",
    "misclassification and problems with measuring bright galaxies will almost certainly increase the error estimates , whilst in the inner 150 kpc the small number of detected galaxies and the blanking factor due to the presence of will lead to greater uncertainties .",
    "the difference between the profile determined purely by the apm detections and that with galaxies missed by the apm but selected by eye included lies within the errors .     around ngc1600 .",
    "the solid line includes galaxies selected by eye , whilst the dotted line is only those galaxies detected by the apm . at the redshift of ngc1600 , @xmath16 is equivalent to @xmath19 . ]",
    "figure 1 clearly shows a decrease in the number density of galaxies with galactocentric distance .",
    "the background galaxy population density appears to be reached at a galactocentric distance of about 1.3 mpc , for a number density of approximately 150 galaxies per square mpc .",
    "fitting an exponential to this distribution gives a slope of @xmath20 .",
    "although slightly steeper than the @xmath21 slope found by smg for their total sample of isolated ellipticals , they agree within the errors .",
    "however , the slope also agrees within the errors with the slope of @xmath22 found for groups and clusters by hansen et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and also for an isothermal distribution . from their study of a sample of 10 isolated ellipticals , reda et al .",

    "figure 2 shows the resultant density profile for this brighter magnitude limit .",
    "although there is evidence of a small excess of galaxies at small galactocentric distances , and these objects are seen by visual inspection of the field , the error bars are large enough such that a uniform distribution , as suggested by reda et al .",

    "there are several similarities between and the fossil groups of jones et al .",
    "( 2003 ) : the large magnitude difference between it and its neighbours , the presence of a surrounding faint population , and the presence of extended x - ray emission .",
    "in addition , the absolute magnitude of ( @xmath117 ) lies within the range of luminosities found for other fossil group central galaxies , although at the fainter end of the range .",
    "moreover , the measured velocity dispersion and absolute @xmath3-band magnitude position perfectly in the @xmath118 _ vs _ @xmath119 relation for fossil groups , as described by khosroshahi et al ( 2006 ) .",
    "if the scaling properties of the fossil groups as measured by donghia et al ( 2005 ) in their simulations apply , would have been already in place ( that is , more than 50% of the mass would already have been assembled ) 7 - 8 gyrs ago , which matches the available age estimates .",
    "however , the x - ray properties of the group are very different from those expected , with a much smaller extent and a much lower luminosity ( sivakoff et al 2004 ) .",
    "thus , could be taken as a new class of fossil group , where the central galaxy has grown from the merger of several fainter group members but is lacking the relatively intense x - ray emission normally associated with loose groups .",
    "thus it could be the result of a merger of a poor group , where the x - ray emission is expected to be much weaker .",
    "the presence of dust and emission regions within the galaxy support this merger hypothesis .",
    "ngc 1132 , an isolated elliptical galaxy studied by mulchaey and zabludoff ( 1999 ) , has similar properties to , with a faint extended x - ray envelope and surrounding excess population of dwarf galaxies , although the dynamical properties of the group are uncertain .",
    "thus may not be the only example of such a past merger .",
    "although is clearly surrounded by a number of other galaxies , the large magnitude difference suggests that it can be treated as an isolated , field , elliptical .",
    "analysis of the apm scans of ukst sky survey plates shows that there is a clear excess of galaxies within the neighbourhood of . in partial agreement with reda et al .",
    "( 2004 ) the excess is most clearly evident for the fainter galaxies , with galaxies brighter than @xmath26 not showing such a clear excess .",
    "the number of galaxies , together with their number density profile , around is in agreement with the results of smg indicating that this galaxy is not unique amongst isolated early - type galaxies .",
    "velocity measurements of galaxies within the field show a large excess at similar redshifts to .",
    "the dynamics of these galaxies indicates that the mass of the group is at least @xmath120 , a value typical of poor groups . combining the data from these and previous studies",
    "indicates that has many similarities to the fossil groups first detected in x - rays , although there are several differences , most notably in the x - ray properties .",
    "we therefore suggest that is a new type of fossil group , the result of the merger of a loose group of galaxies , with the last merger occuring over 4 gyr ago .",
    "the similarity between and other galaxies in the smg sample of isolated ellipticals suggests that many such objects may be the result of the merger of loose groups .",
    "this will only be determined by a detailed photometric and dynamical study of a larger sample of isolated galaxies .",
    "as the majority of galaxies lie in loose groups , including our own , such an investigation would lead to a greater understanding of galaxy evolution .",

    "<S> a study of the galaxy distribution in the field of the elliptical galaxy ngc1600 has been undertaken . </S>",

    "<S> the number density profile of galaxies in the field of this galaxy shows a decline with radius , with evidence of a background at approximately 1.3 mpc . </S>",
    "<S> the density and number density profile are consistent with that found for other isolated early - type galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> ngc1600 appears as an extended source in x - rays , and the center of the x - ray emission seems not to coincide with the center of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity distribution of neighbouring galaxies has been measured from optical spectroscopic observations and shows that the mean radial velocity is approximately @xmath0 less than that of ngc1600 , indicating that the centre of mass could lie outside the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity dispersion of the ` group ' is estimated at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the inferred mass of the system is therefore of the order of @xmath2 , a value that corresponds to a large group . </S>",
    "<S> ngc1600 therefore shares some similarities , but is not identical to , the ` fossil clusters ' detected in x - ray surveys . implications of this result for studies of isolated early - type galaxies are briefly discussed . </S>"
