    "the conventional theory for the origin of disk galaxies in cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmologies involves the dissipational collapse of gas inside relaxed dark matter halos formed through hierarchical clustering @xcite .",
    "this theory endows forming disk galaxies with kinematic properties inherited from the halos that host them @xcite .",
    "early simulations of cosmological structure formation @xcite verified that during linear growth , the angular momentum of halos grows according to perturbation theory @xcite , and by incorporating these results subsequent work explained the flat rotation curves and sizes of disk galaxies through the combination of gas dissipation , halo spin , and the adiabatic response of dark matter to baryonic infall @xcite .",
    "the initial success of the dissipational collapse model led to its establishment as the favored theory for the formation of disk galaxies .",
    "however , numerical modeling revealed that the theory was incomplete .",
    "while smooth , dissipational collapse may be relevant to disk galaxy formation in quiet environments , simulations and semi - analytic modeling have demonstrated that it is rare for halos to acquire most of their angular momentum via the quiescent accretion of tidally torqued material @xcite .",
    "simulation and observational work has shown that the specific angular momentum content of dark matter halos differs from exponential disks @xcite as halos contain comparatively more low angular momentum material that might produce bulges or overly centrally concentrated disks @xcite .",
    "furthermore , simulations of mass accretion onto galaxies indicate that the hierarchical nature of the @xmath0cdm cosmology leads to the destruction of disks when dissipative effects are neglected @xcite",
    ". models of galaxy collisions including dissipation @xcite show that gas can loose angular momentum owing to gravitational torques during these events . in cases when the interstellar medium ( ism ) is isothermal and relatively cold and the gas fraction of the galaxies is small ( @xmath3 of the baryons ) , the subsequent inflow of gas into the centers of the merger remnants forms a roughly spherical stellar distribution through a luminous starburst @xcite , leaving objects that have essentially no extended stellar disks .",
    "cosmological simulations of disk formation with similar physics produce galaxies that are too centrally concentrated , form too many stars , contain overly dominant bulges , and lack angular momentum compared with nearby spirals @xcite .",
    "efforts to resolve these discrepancies in a cosmological context have mainly relied on increasing the impact of feedback from star formation @xcite .",
    "cosmological simulations that utilize strong feedback from star formation in the form of a pressurized ism to produce disk galaxies either produce too few exponential disks compared with observations @xcite or yield galaxies that still contain a significant bulge component @xcite .",
    "while these recent simulations have had some success , taken together the results suggest that the theory of structure formation remains faced with an apparent incompatibility between models of disk formation and the hierarchical growth of structure .",
    "to help resolve this incompatibility , we propose a new , merger - driven theory for the formation of disk galaxies at high redshifts that supplements standard dissipational collapse . in our scenario ,",
    "gas - dominated mergers , where the interacting systems have a gas fraction @xmath4 at the height of the merger , allow for the formation of rotationally - supported disks in remnants if energetic feedback mechanisms limit the conversion of gas into stars .",
    "gas pressurization from a multiphase ism by feedback from star formation @xcite stabilizes gas disks and allows mergers between gas - dominated galaxies to produce large , smoothly distributed , rapidly rotating stellar disks .",
    "our proposed scenario builds upon the results of previous simulations of remnant disk formation in mergers by @xcite and @xcite .    the merger - driven scenario for disk formation transitions naturally into the merger - driven scenario for elliptical galaxy formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as star formation in galaxies over time reduces the gas content of progenitors and prevents the further occurrence of mergers involving gas - dominated systems .",
    "mergers between gas - rich disk galaxies at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath5 ) are still expected to produce realistic elliptical galaxies nearly universally ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as prior quiescent star formation and interactions will decrease their gas content below the necessary @xmath6 needed to produce a disk - dominated remnant .",
    "below we describe the simulation methodology used to demonstrate the merger - driven formation of disk galaxies (  [ section : methodology ] ) , including our methods for studying the effects of feedback (  [ subsection : methodology : feedback ] ) , orbital geometry (  [ subsection : methodology : orbits ] ) , gas fraction (  [ subsection : methodology : gas_fraction ] ) , merger mass - ratio (  [ subsection : methodology : minor_mergers ] ) , and progenitor mass (  [ subsection : methodology : small_mergers ] ) on remnant properties .",

    "to demonstrate the feasibility of our scenario for merger - driven disk formation , we have performed a suite of merger simulations of isolated , gas - rich disk galaxies , with and without feedback from accretion onto supermassive black holes ( bhs ) .",
    "the simulations use smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) @xcite to evolve the gas and incorporate a multiphase ism model @xcite where we control the pressurization @xmath7 of star - forming gas by interpolating between isothermal gas ( @xmath8 ) with a temperature @xmath9 k and a stiffer multiphase medium ( @xmath10 ) with a higher effective temperature @xmath11 k by varying the equation of state ( eos ; for details see * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , has little impact on the global structural properties of the remnants studied here .",
    "this is consistent with the work of @xcite and @xcite who found that black hole feedback likewise has negligible consequence for ellipticals on scales of order the effective radius .",
    "the signatures of black hole growth on the stellar distribution of merger remnants thus appears subtle and may be restricted to modifying the characteristics of the central starburst population formed during the merger ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "to address the often destructive impact of the frequent merging in the @xmath110 cosmology on spiral galaxies , we propose a new , merger - driven scenario for disk galaxy formation at high redshifts that supplements the standard picture based on dissipational collapse @xcite . in this scenario , gas - rich mergers can form rotationally - supported gaseous structures from residual angular momentum after the final coalescence .",
    "this rapidly - rotating material will form stars , and if enough material is available to form a substantial rotationally - supported component the remnant can resemble a disk galaxy both structurally and kinematically .",
    "we perform a suite of twenty - eight merger simulations to address the feasibility of such a scenario for disk galaxy formation and demonstrate that remnant disks can form from sufficiently gas rich mergers with a variety of orbits , mass ratios , and physical models for the ism or the inclusion of growing supermassive black holes .",
    "we provide a detailed summary of these results below .    * we verify the results of by @xcite and @xcite in demonstrating that gas - rich mergers can produce remnant disks . nearly every gas - rich merger produces a rapidly - rotating structure from stars formed in remnant gaseous disks after the merger .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that certain gas - rich mergers can produce remnants whose entire stellar structure is rotationally - supported . a necessary condition for the formation of these disk - dominated remnants",
    "is inferred to be a gas fraction of @xmath131 just prior to the final coalescence , which we have referred to as being `` gas - dominated '' .",
    "merger - driven disk formation is shown to occur under a variety of gas - dominated mergers and is not limited to e.g. idealized prograde - prograde coplanar mergers .",
    "favorable equal mass encounters for merger - driven disk formation include certain polar and inclined orbits with limited star formation during the first pericentric passage .",
    "a successful merger - driven disk formation scenario would requires extremely gas - rich progenitors with gas fractions @xmath132 , and is therefore likely limited to high redshift galaxy assembly .",
    "* the rotational support of remnants is shown to correlate with the pressurization of the ism . using the multiphase ism model of @xcite modified to allow for an adjustable pressurization in the form of an effective equation of state @xcite ,",
    "the merger simulations demonstrate that pressurized ism models limit the amount of gas consumed before the final coalescence of the progenitors .",
    "the reduced star formation increases the gaseous material available to form a rapidly - rotating remnant disk and improves the rotational support of the remnant system .",
    "weakly pressurized ism models either produce unstable progenitors owing to the high gas fractions or have efficient star formation . in both cases",
    "the merging systems experience a mostly stellar collision that simply kinematically heats the existing stars without producing a newly - formed disk to contribute to the rotation of the remnant .",
    "* gas - rich minor mergers can produce disk galaxies with substantial rotational support ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "the mass ratio @xmath134 merger simulated for a range of gas fractions produces a remnant disk galaxy rotationally - supported at all measured radii @xmath135 kpc .",
    "the central velocity dispersion during the merger roughly doubles and the old stellar disk is heated .",
    "the rotational support of the remnant disks remaining from gas - rich minor mergers is considerably larger than that measured for comparable gas - poor minor mergers by @xcite , who calculate @xmath121 for @xmath136 mass - ratio gas - poor mergers .",
    "the simulations confirm that merger - driven disk formation from gas - rich encounters at high redshift may be possible and highlight the role of energetic feedback on the rotational support of extremely gas - rich merger remnants . finally , to confirm the merger - driven scenario for disk galaxy formation as a viable supplement to the dissipational collapse model ,",
    "cosmological simulations of galaxy formation including pressurized multiphase ism physics should be performed at sufficient resolution to determine the importance of early , gas - dominated mergers to the cosmological frequency of disk galaxies .",
    "while cosmological simulations of galaxy formation with multiphase ism physics appear promising @xcite , simulations with sufficient resolution to track early interactions between gas - rich systems may provide a more comprehensive picture of cosmological disk galaxy formation .",
