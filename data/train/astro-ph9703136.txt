    "the detection of galaxies at their formation epoch has been a long - standing goal .",
    "yee et al .",
    "( 1996 ) recently reported the discovery of a protogalaxy candidate , designated cb58 , at a high redshift of @xmath0 .",
    "ellingson et al .  ( 1996 ) concluded that the spectral energy distribution of cb58 is most consistent with a population synthesis model ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ) for young age ( @xmath1 a few @xmath2 yr ) and reddening of @xmath3 .",
    "the star formation rate ( sfr ) inferred from the system s extremely high luminosity of @xmath4 is 4700 @xmath5 ( @xmath6 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 , q@xmath8 .",
    "such a high sfr is enough to make all the stars in a giant galaxy within a few @xmath9 years .",
    "this indicates that cb58 may be the long - sought galaxy in the initial starburst phase .",
    "when corrected to zero extinction the sfr value is still as high as 400 @xmath10 .",
    "these values are extremely high compared to a mean sfr of 9.3 @xmath5 for other distant galaxies ( steidel et al .",
    "1996a ) where zero extinction is assumed .",
    "the central surface brightness of cb58 is about 21 mag / arcsec@xmath11 in the v band ( yee et al .",
    "this is about 2 mag brighter that the mean central surface brightness of high-@xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) star forming galaxies but comparable to the brightest known examples ( giavalisco et al .",
    "1996 , steidel et al .",
    "thus cb58 could be regarded as one of the most active star - forming galaxy known .",
    "however , one should consider the possible effect of amplification by gravitational lensing because , in projection , cb58 lies close ( @xmath14 ) to the center of the cluster of galaxies ms1512.4 + 3647 which is in the foreground at @xmath15 .",
    "williams and lewis ( 1996 ) claimed that the phenomenal properties of this protogalaxy candidate are in fact due to amplification by gravitational lensing by the foreground cluster , and that the unlensed properties of the source are typical of high - redshift starforming systems .",
    "the high surface brightness of cb58 does not rule out the lensing hypothesis , since lensing conserves surface brightness , but does require that it be atypical .",
    "however , the lensing amplification is rather sensitive to the assumed cluster mass distribution model",
    ". therefore , detailed knowledge of the cluster mass distribution is very important to quantify the impact of amplification by lensing and to judge whether the apparently huge star formation rate of cb58 is only an artefact .",
    "x - ray observations are ideal for quantifying the cluster mass distribution . assuming hydrostatic equilibrium for the x - ray emitting hot gas distribution , the measurement of the temperature and density distribution of the hot intra - cluster gas give good constraints on the cluster mass distribution .",
    "here , we reexamine the lensing amplification effect in cb58 due to the cluster ms1512.4 + 3647 by constraining its mass distribution using temperature data obtained from asca and rosat pspc observations and a gas distribution determined from rosat hri observations .    finally , we argue that cb58 provides a new opportunity to place constraints on the value of the cosmological constant , primarily because there is no lensed counter image ( see fig . 2 of yee et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "throughout this paper , the hubble constant @xmath16 is taken to be 75@xmath17 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 .",
    "asca observations of ms1512.4 + 3647 were performed in january 1995 with an effective exposure time of 19 ks .",
    "the sis observations were performed in 2 ccd faint mode for high bit rate observations and 2 ccd bright mode for medium bit rate observations .",
    "the faint mode data were converted to bright mode using the standard ftools software .",
    "additional data reduction was done with the standard ftools and xspec packages .",
    "figure 1 shows the resulting x - ray spectrum of ms1512 . for gis  2 and gis  3 ,",
    "source counts were extracted from a circle of 6 arcmin radius centered on the source ; for the sis , a circle of 4.3 arcmin radius centered on the source was selected .",
    "the background was taken from the blank sky observation obtained at the same detector positions .",
    "we use the summed spectra of the two gis and the two sis for the spectral analysis .",
    "rosat pspc observations of ms1512.4 + 3647 were performed in august 1992 with an exposure time of 5.2 ks .",
    "the source spectrum was extracted from a 2.5 arcmin radius circle centered on the cluster after the point source about @xmath18 south of the cluster had been masked out .",
    "the background was taken from a 4.16 arcmin wide annulus around the source region within which all apparent sources had been masked out .",
    "the best fitting raymond - smith parameters obtained in a simultaneous fit to the asca and rosat data are summarized in table 1 together with their 68% confidence errors for one interesting parameter , where the redshift is fixed to that of ms1512.4 + 3647 , @xmath19 .",
    "the best - fit value for the hydrogen column density is consistent with the galactic value of @xmath20 @xmath21 of dickey and lockman ( 1990 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows @xmath22 contours for 68% , 90% and 99% confidence for two interesting parameters , temperature and @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath23 value is well constrained by the rosat pspc spectrum ; the main source of error in the temperature measurement are the photon statistics of the asca data .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we are now ready to examine the lensing amplification effects on cb58 due to the cluster of galaxies ms1512.4 + 3647 .",
    "our fundamental assumptions for the construction of a model of the cluster mass distribution are : ( 1 ) the x - ray emitting hot gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium with the cluster s gravitational field , ( 2 ) the cluster has a spherically symmetric mass distribution , ( 3 ) the x - ray gas is isothermal and is in a single phase , ( 4 ) the center of the mass distribution of the cluster coincides with the center of the cd .",
    "the first of these assumptions is supported by the ratio of specific energy in galaxies and gas . using the cluster s galaxy velocity dispersion of @xmath24 km s@xmath7 ( carlberg et al . , 1996 )",
    ", we find this ratio , conventionally denoted by @xmath25 , to be @xmath26 , i.e.  consistent with unity .",
    "the ratio is somewhat larger than @xmath27 determined by x - ray surface brightness distribution .",
    "however bahcall & lubin ( 1994 ) have pointed out that the standard hydrostatic - isothermal model predicts @xmath28 , rather than @xmath29 . taking this into account ,",
    "@xmath25 is consistent with @xmath27 .",
    "the fourth assumption is true based on the hri astrometry . since , with rosat , the conversion from flux to count rate is almost constant for hot gas in the temperature range from 2 to 10 kev , and the temperature of ms1512.4 + 3647 in the cluster rest frame is much higher than 2 kev , the gas density profile can be unambiguously obtained from the x - ray surface brightness profile without knowing the precise temperature distribution .",
    "according to the @xmath27 model , the electron density distribution of ms1512.4 + 3647 is described by @xmath30^{-3\\beta/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the angular diameter distance between observer and lensing cluster . in this equation , as in the following , @xmath33 and @xmath27 are taken to be @xmath34 arcsec and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "inverting the hydrostatic equilibrium equation yields the cluster mass contained within a radius @xmath36 : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the mean molecular weight for gas of cosmic abundance .",
    "the lens equation for this mass distribution is @xmath39 where @xmath40 @xmath41 is the angular core radius , @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) is the angle between the lens and the source ( image ) in units of @xmath41 , and @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) is the angular diameter distance between the lens ( the observer ) and the source ( the explicit expression is given in fukugita et al .",
    "@xmath46 is called the lens parameter and determines the efficiency of the lens .",
    "it should be noted that , as the lens parameter does not depend on the hubble constant , neither do the amplification effects on cb58 . when @xmath47 , the lens always produces a single image .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath48 , a counter image may be produced if @xmath42 is sufficiently small to satisfy the condition @xmath49 the lens parameter for cb58 is @xmath50 for @xmath51 , @xmath52 kev , and @xmath53 in an einstein - de sitter universe , i.e.  @xmath54 with @xmath55 being the density parameter and @xmath56 the normalized cosmological constant . in the following , we shall mainly consider the following three extreme models ; spatially flat universes with @xmath57 and @xmath58 and the open universe with @xmath59 .",
    "yee et al . ( 1996 ) observed cb58 with the canada - france - hawaii telescope .",
    "the seeing was @xmath60 and @xmath61 fwhm for the averaged @xmath62 and @xmath63 bands respectively . with a width of @xmath64 ( sufficiently larger than the seeing ) the image of cb58",
    "is well resolved .",
    "we approximate the observed image of cb58 as an ellipse with a semi - major axis of @xmath65 and an axis ratio of @xmath66 .",
    "see figure 6 and compare to figure 2 of yee et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .    using the lens equation ( 4 )",
    ", we can create the unlensed source image by mapping the observed image back onto the source plane .",
    "the amplification is then calculated as the ratio of the areas of the observed and the un - lensed images .",
    "figure 5 demonstrates how sensitive the amplification is to variations in the cluster core radius and temperature .",
    "the positions of the peaks correspond to configurations where the observed image position coincides with a critical line ( schneider et al .",
    "1992 ) . in the region",
    "where condition ( 6 ) is satisfied a bright counter image appears .",
    "it is important to realize that the amplification may become large even in the single image case and that it is possible to have a strongly magnified lensed image without large image distortion .",
    "the general physical mechanism for forming such a lensed image is discussed by futamase , hamana & hattori ( 1997 ) .",
    "figure 6 shows the counter image ( left ) , the un - lensed source image mapped onto the lens plane ( center ) , and the observed image ( right ) for various values of @xmath41 . in the case of figure 6b ,",
    "the observed image straddles a critical line , therefore the predicted source image consists of two parts of opposite parity . in the case of figure 6c , there is no counter image and the predicted source image is less distorted .",
    "the magnitude difference between the observed image and the counter image is shown in figure 7 . when the core radius is small enough for a counter image to appear",
    ", the latter must be at least as bright as the observed image .",
    "the fact that no such bright counter image is observed in the field around the cd galaxy , together with the measured temperature and mass distribution for the cluster , provides strong constraints on the amplification of the observed image .",
    "figure 8(a)-(c ) shows the allowed region for temperature and core radius as well as lines of constant amplification for the single image situation for three cosmological models , namely @xmath67 , and @xmath58 respectively . from figure 8(d ) , it can be seen that a large cosmological constant reduces the single image region drastically .",
    "the reason for this is the following : condition ( 6 ) , which determines when a counter image is produced , is expressed in terms of the lens parameter which , in turn , depends on the gas temperature , the core radius of the cluster mass distribution and a combination of two angular diameter distances .",
    "the first two quantities can be constrained by x - ray observations as shown in section 2 .",
    "the last one depends strongly on the value of the cosmological constant ( fukugita , futamase & kasai 1990 ) .",
    "therefore , the value of the cosmological constant can , in principle , be constrained by the requirement that there be no counter image of cb58 .",
    "this new test was first proposed by futamase , hamana & hattori ( 1997 ) , and cb58 is the first and very good application of this method .",
    "if the best fit value of the temperature from the asca and rosat pspc analysis and the best fit value of the core radius from the rosat hri analysis are assumed , any universe model with reasonable cosmological parameters predicts a bright counter image of cb58 which is not observed .",
    "if the @xmath68 errors in temperature and core radius are taken into account , both an open universe and a flat universe with zero cosmological constant are acceptable and predict that the amplification of cb58 can be as large as 25 .",
    "however , only a small part of the temperature  core radius region is allowed . on the other hand , a flat universe with a large cosmological constant",
    "does not have any acceptable region .",
    "however , if @xmath69 or @xmath70 measurement errors are taken into account , the above mentioned constraints are relaxed .",
    "the statistical errors in the temperature is large : @xmath71 , @xmath72 . a flat universe with a large cosmological constant can have an acceptable region . a large range of amplifications from several to 25 is possible regardless of the cosmological models .",
    "if the lensing amplification of cb58 were 50 , its intrinsic star formation rate would be reduced to a value found for other distant galaxies ( steidel et al . , 1996a ) .",
    "hence , although such a high amplification is improbable , we can not definitely determine whether cb58 really features a very high star formation rate or is just a normal starburst galaxy at high redshift .",
    "how sensitive is this result to changes in our model assumptions ?",
    "one of our initial assumptions was that the x - ray emitting gas is isothermal and in a single phase .",
    "if a cooling flow existed in ms1512.4 + 3647 it would cause the gas to be multiphase in the central region of the cluster .",
    "allen et al . ( 1996 ) claimed that for clusters hosting strong cooling flows the use of a single phase model can lead to significant underestimates of the overall temperature .",
    "accordingly , a strong cooling flow in ms1512.4 + 3647 would mean a higher lower limit to the lensing amplification and more severe constraints on the cosmological constant .",
    "however , contrary to the results from earlier work ( stocke et al , 1991 ) , we find the evidence for a cooling flow to be marginal for this cluster .",
    "we also assumed that the cluster has a spherically symmetric mass distribution .",
    "the rosat hri image ( figure 3 ) , however , shows the x - ray emission to be assymmetric outside of the core region .",
    "bartelmann ( 1995 ) has pointed out that deviations from spherical symmetry in cluster lenses enhance the tidal effect ( shear ) and alter the lensing efficiency of the cluster .",
    "however , to allow the effects of the asymmetry in ms1512.4 + 3647 to be quantified , an accurate spatial model of the mass distribution is required .",
    "such a model is now being developed .",
    "the observations presented here may be used to measure the gas mass fraction in this cluster .",
    "inserting the central gas density found in section 2.2 into equation ( 2 ) and integrating out to the maximum radius detected ( @xmath73 or 0.42 h@xmath74 mpc ) , we find a gas mass of @xmath75 h@xmath76 m@xmath77 .",
    "this mass is proportional to the core radius cubed , which accounts for the large error , see table 2 .",
    "the total mass out to the same radius , from equation ( 3 ) is @xmath78 h@xmath74 m@xmath77 .",
    "hence the gas mass fraction is @xmath79 h@xmath80 .",
    "this value , although poorly constrained , is consistent with that of low redshift clusters ( white and fabian , 1995 ) .",
    "we have examined the amplification of cb58 due to gravitational lensing by the foreground cluster of galaxies ms1512.4 + 3647 based on rosat and asca x - ray observations of the cluster .",
    "unfortunately , with the available x - ray observations we can not specify the physical parameters of the foreground cluster ms1512.4 + 3647 accurately enough to evaluate the lensing amplification and definitely determine whether cb58 is a normal star forming galaxy .",
    "we have also shown that cb58 allows a new and promising test to constrain the value of the cosmological constant . in this study , however , we can not give a strong constraint on the cosmological constant , because of large statistical errors in our x - ray observations .",
    "if one could measure an accurate mass distribution for ms1512.4 + 3647 , particularly its ellipticity , then the observational fact that no counter image of cb58 is observed would give a strong constraint on the cosmological constant . from both points of view , it is highly desirable to perform further observations to obtain more accurate information on the temperature and the mass distribution of the cluster ms1512.4 + 3647 .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank t. yamada for useful discussions .",
    "we also thank i. gioia for making available to us the optical image of ms1512.4 + 3647 .",
    "mh thanks d. neumann and t. miyaji for useful comments on x - ray data analysis .",
