    "the free - energy landscape of protein molecules represents the key - information for understanding processes of biomolecular self - organization such as folding .",
    "@xcite the free - energy landscape , indeed , determines all observable properties of the folding process , ranging from protein stability to folding rates .",
    "@xcite unfortunately , for real proteins , sophisticated all - atom computational methods fail to characterize the free - energy surface , since they are currently limited to explore only few stages of the folding process . as an alternative",
    ", one can argue that , taking into account all the complex details of chemical interactions is not necessary to understand how proteins fold into their native state .",
    "rather , elementary models incorporating the fundamental physics of folding , while still leaving the calculation and simulations simple , can reproduce the general features of the free - energy landscape and explain a number of experimental results .",
    "this attitude , typical of a statistical mechanics approach , agrees with the widely accepted view that `` a surprising simplicity underlies folding '' ( baker@xcite ) .",
    "in fact several experimental@xcite and theoretical studies@xcite indicate the topology of protein native state as a determinant factor of folding . as examples",
    ", one can mention the fact that even heavy changes in the sequence that preserve the native state , have a little effect on the folding rates.@xcite moreover , the latter are found to correlate to the average contact order,@xcite which is a topological property of native state .",
    "finally , proteins with similar native state but low sequence similarity often have similar transition state ensembles.@xcite    within this context , elementary models@xcite which correctly embody the native state topology and interactions , are believed to be useful in describing the energy landscape of real proteins . in this paper , we study one of such topology - based models proposed by galzitskaya and finkelstein ( gf),@xcite which was developed to identify the folding nucleus and the transition state configurations of proteins . the model employs a free - energy function with a reasonable formulation of the conformational entropy , which is certainly the most difficult contribution to describe .",
    "the energetic term , instead , takes into account only native state attractive interactions . in the original paper,@xcite the model",
    "was combined with a dynamic programming algorithm to search for transition states of various proteins . to reduce the computational cost of the search , two kinds of approximations were introduced :",
    "the protein was regarded as made up of `` chain links '' of 2 - 4 residues , that fold / unfold together ; besides , only configurations with up to three stretches of contiguous native residues were considered in the search ( `` triple - sequence approximation '' ) . as shown in ref .",
    ", the effect of such assumptions is a drastic entropy reduction of the unfolded state and possibly of the transition state .",
    "this produces free energy profiles very different from the true ones , thus spoiling the evaluation of @xmath1-values .    here ,",
    "we apply the model in a more general statistical mechanical philosophy : namely , we develop three different mean - field approaches of increasing complexity , and compare their prediction with the exact results , obtained by exhaustive enumeration of all the configurations , in the case of a 16-residues - long peptide ( c - terminal 41 - 56 fragment of the streptococcal protein g - b1)@xcite which is known to fold , in isolation , to a @xmath0-hairpin structure.@xcite our main goal here is to test the model against experimental findings and to test the mean - field predictions against the exact results . in the future",
    "we will use this knowledge to apply the appropriate mean - field approach to the case of real proteins , for which exhaustive enumeration is unfeasible .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we present and describe the main features of the gf model . in section",
    "ii , we introduce and discuss three mean - field approximations : the usual scheme , and two other approaches stemming from the knowledge of the exact solution for the muoz - eaton model.@xcite in section iii , we apply the model and its mean - field approximations to study the folding transition of the @xmath0-hairpin and discuss our results .",
    "the gf model assumes a simple description of the polypeptide chain , where residues can stay only in an ordered ( native ) or disordered ( non - native ) state .",

    "when all variables take the value @xmath8 the protein is correctly folded , whereas the random coil corresponds to all @xmath9 s . since each residue can be in one of the two states , ordered or disordered , the free energy landscape consists of @xmath10 configurations only .",
    "this drastic reduction of the number of available configurations represents , of course , a restrictive feature of the model , however , follows the same line of the well known zimm - bragg model@xcite widely employed to describe the helix to coil transition in heteropolymers .    the effective hamiltonian ( indeed , a free - energy function ) is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is given by : @xmath13\\ , .",

    "non native interactions are neglected : this assumption , that can be just tested _ a posteriori _ , is expected to hold if , during the folding process , the progress along the reaction coordinate is well depicted on the basis of the native contacts ( that is , the reaction coordinate(s ) must be related to just the native contacts ) . moreover",
    ", such progress must be slow with respect to all other motions , so that all non - native interaction can be `` averaged - out '' when considering the folding process.@xcite @xmath16 denotes the element @xmath7,@xmath17 of the contact matrix , whose entries are the number of heavy - atom contacts between residues @xmath7 and @xmath17 in the native state . here",

    "notice that , in the spirit of considering the geometry more relevant than the sequence details , every ( heavy ) atom - atom contact is treated on equal footing : the chemical nature of the atoms is ignored , together with a correct account for the different kind of interactions .    the second term in ( [ eq : finkel ] ) is the conformational entropy associated to the presence of unfolded regions along the chain , and vanishes in the native state .",
    "more precisely the first term in eq .",

    "we see , from the first three columns of table  [ tab : correla ] , that gf model predicts that the @xmath0-hairpin folding begins with the formation of contacts 6@xmath10811 and 6@xmath1089 , 9@xmath10811 and 6@xmath1088 , located in the region between the turn ( 8@xmath1089 ) and the hydrophobic cluster . then , upon lowering the temperature , the folding proceeds with the formation of the other contacts that complete @xmath0-hairpin structure .",
    "this is at odds with the results of more detailed models and simulations  @xcite predicting that folding starts with the formation of contacts between the side chains of the hydrophobic cluster , and proceeds with the stabilization of the hydrogen bonds in the loop region ( there is no agreement on the order of hydrogen - bonds formation , though ) .",
    "gf model predictions are different also from those of the muoz - eaton model,@xcite where the hairpin starts folding from the loop region and proceeds outwards in a zipper fashion .",
    "experimental results relying on point mutations@xcite witness the importance of the hydrophobic residues 3 , 5 , 12 and , to a minor extent , 14 , in stabilizing the hairpin structure .",
    "remarkably , contacts between residues 6 , 9 , 11 appear to be partially present also in denaturing conditions.@xcite    it is interesting to notice , however , that , according to table [ tab : correla ] , contacts 3@xmath10813 , 4@xmath10814 , 3@xmath10812 , 12@xmath10814 , 4@xmath10813 of the hydrophobic cluster are mainly established around the folding temperature , which suggests that also in gf model the hydrophobic cluster plays a central role .",
    "this is a nice feature of the model because it is consistent with the experimental evidence ( fluorence signal ) for the formation of the tryptophan hydrophobic environment at the folding .",
    "the estimation of correlation functions provided by mfa3 is only in qualitative agreement with exact results ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : correla ] ) : contacts are formed in a narrower range of temperatures , and a direct comparison would be meaningless . however we can ask what kind of information can be extracted from the mean - field results , wondering , for instance , whether the ranking of contact formation provided by mfa3 is `` statistically equivalent '' to that given by exact solution . thus",
    ", we apply the spearman rank - order correlation test.@xcite this test amounts to computing spearman correlation @xmath161 where @xmath47 , and @xmath162 are the integer indicating the positions of the @xmath7-th contact in the two ranking respectively .",
    "the parameter , @xmath163 is @xmath8 when the order in the two ranks is the same @xmath164 , while @xmath165 , when the order is reverse @xmath166 . for data in table",
    "[ tab : correla ] , we obtain the value @xmath167 , that has a probability @xmath168 to take place if the null hypothesis of uncorrelated ranks holds .",
    "this indicates that the order between the contacts obtained with exact and approximate methods is extremely significative : the mean - field approach basically recovers the correct order of contact formation and relevance as obtained with the true original model .",
    "one of the most important experimental techniques for characterizing the folding nucleus of a protein ( more precisely of a protein with two - state folding ) consists in the evaluation of @xmath169values .",
    "@xmath169values measure the effect of `` perturbation '' introduced in a protein by site - directed mutagenesis.@xcite a mutation performed on the @xmath7-th residue may affect the thermodynamics and kinetics , by altering the free - energy difference between the native and unfolded state ( i.e. the stability gap ) or the height of the folding / unfolding barrier .",
    "its effect is quantified through the @xmath170-value , defined as @xmath171 where @xmath172 , @xmath173 , and @xmath174 and @xmath175 are the variations , with respect to the wild type protein , introduced by the mutation in the folding barrier and stability gap .",
    "experimentally , @xmath174 is derived from the changes in the kinetic rates induced by different denaturant concentrations , while @xmath175 is extracted from the changes in the equilibrium population .",
    "@xmath170-values are different for different mutations of a residue ; in any case , a @xmath170-value close to one implies that the mutated residue has a native - like environment in the transition state and hence is involved in the folding nucleus .",
    "a value close to zero , instead , indicates that the transition state remains unaffected by the mutation , and hence the mutated residue is still unfolded at transition .    in our theoretical description ,",
    "a mutation at site @xmath7 is simulated by weakening the strength of the couplings @xmath176 of @xmath8% between residue @xmath7 and the others .",
    "we choose a small perturbation because we can not predict what kind of rearrangements in the local structure , and hence in the contact map , a true residue - to - residue mutation would involve .",
    "our choice warrants that the effect of mutation remains local and does not disrupt completely the state . in figure",
    "[ fig : varprof ] , we show the effect of a `` mutation '' of the sixth residue ( asp46 ) on the free - energy profiles .",
    "variation on the free - energy profile induced by the perturbation on all the interactions involving the sixth residue ( asp46 ) of the hairpin .",
    "the variation ( in kcal mol@xmath132 ) is computed for both the exact solution and mfa3 , at the respective temperatures of equal populations of the native and unfolded basins .",
    "solid and dashed lines indicate wild - type and mutated profiles respectively for the exact solution ; dot - dashed and points refer to wild - type and mutated profile respectively in the mfa3 . ]    to evaluate the @xmath170-values , we compute the variations in free energy profiles induced by each mutation , for the exact solution and mfa3 . @xmath177 and @xmath178 are evaluated as @xmath179 , where @xmath180 @xmath181 are , respectively , the partition functions restricted to unfolded and native basins in the free - energy profile , i.e. the regions to the left and right of the top of the barrier in fig .  [ fig : profiles ] .",
    "@xmath182 is the free - energy of the top of the barrier . through expression eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi ] ) we obtain the @xmath169values for each residue . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phival ] we report the @xmath169value distributions .",
    "there is a good overall correlation between the profiles , that increase and decrease together .",
    "effects of `` mutations '' as measured by @xmath169values on each residue .",
    "full circles : @xmath169values from the exact solution ; open circles : @xmath169values within mfa3 approach .",
    "the temperatures are in both cases those whereby @xmath183 .",
    "results depend only slightly on temperature , anyway . ]",
    "this is a further confirmation that the relevant features of the model are conserved when applying the mf approach .",
    "mean - field results yield smoother profiles , as it could be expected .",
    "the ends of the hairpin are characterized by low @xmath170-values , that become negative for mfa3 : this would correspond to mutations that increase the stability gap but decrease the barrier , or vice - versa . according to these results ,",
    "the folding nucleus would be made up by residues 6 , 8 , 9 , 11 , which is in contrast with the already mentioned simulations .",
    "in this work we developed and discussed three different mean - field schemes for the galzitskaya - finkelstein model , that represent valid ways to deal with the model for characterizing the thermodynamical properties of a protein and its folding pathway as well . these approaches offer viable alternatives both to the procedure proposed by galzitskaya and finkelstein,@xcite and to mc simulations , that become computationally demanding for long polymers and usually affected from the sampling problems .",
    "we applied the model to the @xmath0-hairpin fragment 41 - 56 of the gb 1 protein , since , for this simple system , mean field results can be compared with a brute force solution of the model , and both can be checked against experimental data and simulation published by other groups .",
    "our results suggest that , as far as specific heat and simple thermodynamic quantities are concerned , the standard mean - field mfa1 is enough to yield correct results , provided that one uses the recipe eq .",
    "( [ eq : matching ] ) to connect the two branches of the solution . for more sophisticated quantities like free - energy profiles , correlations and @xmath170-values ,",
    "mfa3 is to be preferred , since it correctly recovers the main features of the exact solution .",
    "the hope is that mean - field results are still representative of the exact ones in the case of longer and more complex proteins , where the latter can not be evaluated .",
    "gf model itself yields results that are somewhat in contrast with the mc and md simulations on more detailed models for the hairpin .",
    "this discrepancy is probably due to the extreme simplicity of the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : finkel ] ) , where no distinction is made among the different kinds of interactions , such as hydrogen - bonds , side chain hydrophobicity , and so on .",
    "indeed , we expected that a model accounting just for the topology of the native state will not score very well when applied to the @xmath0-hairpin , where detailed sequence information is relevant.@xcite predictions of the model could possibly improve if these elements were taken into account .",
