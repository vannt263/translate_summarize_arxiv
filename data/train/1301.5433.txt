    "the immense complex of the taurus , perseus , and auriga ( tpa ) clouds is known to be one of the largest local associations of dark nebula . according to @xcite , the total masses of the whole complex is @xmath3 solar mass .",
    "the tpa complex contains star - forming cloudlets ( tmc1 , tmc2 , ngc 1333 , and ic 348 , for example ) , a bright emission nebula ( ngc 1499 , also known as california nebula ) , and stellar associations ( per ob2 , for example ) .",
    "low - mass star formation processes are believed to be taking place in the eastern section of the complex ( taurus and auriga ) , where mostly low - mass t tauri type stars are observed , while both low- and high - mass stars are being formed in the western section of the perseus complex ( the per ob2 association , the open cluster ngc 1333 , and so on ) .",
    "the whole complex may be physically associated with the per ob2 stellar association , centered at ( l , b)=(160.5 , -14.7 ) with a diameter of @xmath4 , which is the second closest ob association to the sun with a distance of @xmath0300 pc on average @xcite .",
    "recent supernova explosions in the per ob2 association are believed to have created an expanding hi supershell that is moving into the surrounding interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "the tpa complex may consist of multiple layers of molecular gas located at various distances .",
    "the taurus cloud is believed to spread between 100 pc and 200 pc @xcite , with a large part of it blocked by the cloud itself @xcite .",
    "the most distant part of the taurus molecular cloud complex may be interacting with a supershell blown by the per ob2 association @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that the cloud in the region of ngc 1333 , one of the star forming regions located in and around the perseus cloud , consists of two layers , and estimated their distances to be @xmath0170 pc and @xmath0230 pc based on an extinction analysis .",
    "the auriga dark cloud , located at a distance similar to that of the taurus cloud , is usually regarded as part of the taurus - auriga complex , and was suggested to overlap with the california cloud at its farthest side @xcite .",
    "the california cloud seems to be the most distant cloud in this region : @xcite argued that the cloud is located at @xmath0450 pc from the sun .    the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) , composed of radiations originating directly from stellar sources as well as the diffuse background , plays an important role in the physical and chemical processes of the interstellar medium ( ism ) . for example ,",
    "far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) isrf photons may ionize atoms , dissociate molecules , or heat gases by ejecting electrons from dust grains or by directly exciting atoms and molecules .",
    "the isrf itself is also affected by interactions with the ism .",
    "in fact , most of the diffuse fuv background radiation is believed to originate from the scattering of starlight by interstellar dust @xcite .",
    "the effect of dust scattering is well observed in reflection nebulae and dark clouds as well as in the diffuse galactic light ( dgl ) .",
    "hence , the observations of these objects have been used not only to trace interstellar dust , but also to obtain the optical properties of dust itself , such as the albedo ( a ) and the phase function asymmetry factor ( g ) . in the case of the dgl ,",
    "dust scattering was observed to be moderately reflective in the forward direction @xcite , with the estimated values of a and g in general agreement with those of the theoretical model for carbonaceous - silicate grains , i.e. , 0.40 - 0.60 and 0.55 - 0.65 , respectively , at uv wavelengths @xcite . for reflection nebulae @xcite and individual clouds @xcite , however , the results were varied and dependent on the individual targets , probably due to uncertainties in the scattering geometry of the target clouds as well as the star systems that were the dominant sources of photons @xcite .",
    "@xcite determined a and g to be 0.7 - 0.8 and @xmath00.75 around 1600  , respectively , for dust toward ic 43 , while @xcite estimated a and g to be @xmath00.22 and @xmath00.74 , respectively , for wavelengths below 2200 @xmath5 for the pleiades nebula . for the ophiuchus cloud , @xcite found a and g to be @xmath00.40 and @xmath00.55 , respectively , at @xmath01100  , while @xcite obtained @xmath00.36 and @xmath00.52 for a and g , respectively , for 1370 1670  .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have estimated the locations of the four prominent clouds in the tpa region by comparing the observed fuv images with the results of the monte carlo simulations of dust scattering .",
    "for the taurus cloud , we obtained a distance to the front face and a thickness of the cloud of @xmath6 pc and @xmath7 pc , respectively .",
    "there have been many reports on the physical structure of the taurus cloud . @xcite",
    "estimated the mean distance to the taurus complex to be @xmath0135 pc , based on the distances to the stars associated with the taurus cloud .",
    "@xcite suggested that the cloud spreads between 100 pc and 200 pc , based on the results of star counting , the distances of the reflection nebulae , and the color excess of the field stars .",
    "@xcite also reported that extinction begins to increase sharply at 130 - 180 pc .",
    "the present result agrees well with all these observations . for the perseus cloud , the present simulation estimates a distance to the front face and a thickness of @xmath8 pc and @xmath9 pc , respectively . the scatter plot of the simulated vs. the observed fuv intensity in figure [ fig : simnobs_scatt](b ) shows severely scattered data points for the perseus cloud , indicating that the model cloud does not adequately describe its actual structure .",
    "in fact , the data points corresponding to the observation are spread over a wide range of intensity , which we believe comes from the assumption of a single layer for the cloud .",
    "hence , we have divided the perseus cloud into two sub - regions and fit them separately .",
    "we name per a as the western part of the cloud and per b as the eastern part , as shown in figure [ fig : multiwave](d ) , and these include the two regions ngc 1333 and ic 348 , respectively . with the same fixed values of the albedo ( a = 0.42 ) and the asymmetry factor ( g = 0.47 ) as used in the previous simulations",
    ", we find a distance to the front face and a thickness of the per a region of @xmath10 pc and @xmath11 pc , respectively , and a distance to the front face and a thickness of the per b region of @xmath0320 pc and @xmath030 pc within @xmath12 pc error range , respectively .",
    "the scatter plot is now improved considerably , as shown in figure 9 . for the western portion of the perseus cloud",
    ", @xcite obtained @xmath0170 pc and @xmath0230 pc for the distances of the two layers in this region , while @xcite , using the parallax observation of the 22 ghz h@xmath13o maser , directly measured the distance of ngc 1333 to be @xmath0240 pc .",
    "the rather thick cloud obtained in the present simulation for per a may reflect the multi - layer nature of the cloud suggested by @xcite .",
    "the distance to the eastern portion of the perseus cloud containing ic 348 was estimated to be larger than 300 pc @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that the thickness was estimated to be rather small for per b in the present simulation .",
    "it was seen that the intensity of the scattered emission was very high when the cloud was placed at a distance below 300 pc .",
    "we believe the emission observed in the per b region comes from backward scattering reflected by the cloud itself .",
    "+    for the auriga cloud , the distance to its front face and its thickness are estimated in the present study to be @xmath14 pc and @xmath15 pc , respectively , and for the california cloud , they are @xmath16 pc and @xmath17 pc , respectively .",
    "@xcite suggested that the auriga cloud has a two - layered structure near the eastern end of the california cloud , with the layers located at @xmath0115 - 135 pc and @xmath0270 - 380 pc , based on an extinction study .",
    "@xcite determined a distance to the california cloud of @xmath0350 pc while @xcite suggested that the cloud is located at @xmath0450 pc from the sun .",
    "@xcite argued that the california cloud region is two - layered , with the first layer at @xmath0160 pc and the second layer at @xmath0350 pc . with the present single - slab model ,",
    "it is impossible to reproduce such multi - layer structures .",
    "instead , we obtained single thick clouds , encompassing two layers of the clouds .",
    "we note that the estimated value of @xmath0330 pc to the center of the california cloud is larger than the distance to the per ob2 association ( @xmath0300 pc on average , @xcite ) . hence , the california cloud , being located behind the per ob2 association which is a candidate source for the bright fuv emission seen in this region , does not block the emission from the association .",
    "figure [ fig : summary ] shows a summary of our distance estimations for the four clouds , along with previous observations for the corresponding clouds .",
    "we have plotted in figure [ fig : dameco ] the velocity - clipped co emission maps for the ranges given in the local standard of rest ( lsr ) frame : ( a ) from -21.8 km / s to + 30.2 km / s , ( b ) from -10.7 km / s to -0.3 km / s , ( c ) from + 0.3 km / s to + 2.9 km / s , and ( d ) from + 4.2 km / s to + 10.7 km / s .",
    "these maps are reproduced from the co sky survey data by @xcite .",
    "while the differences in the lsr velocities do not necessarily imply their relative distances , they may give insightful clues to the physical associations of the corresponding clouds .",
    "for example , the california cloud is seen in figure [ fig : dameco](b ) and no other clouds are seen in that velocity range . in figure",
    "[ fig : dameco](d ) , however , we can see indications of the taurus , auriga , and perseus clouds , but not of the california cloud .",
    "such a grouping may indicate that the california cloud is physically not connected to other clouds , while the rest of the clouds system may be more or less associated .",
    "furthermore , parts of the auriga and perseus clouds are also seen in figure [ fig : dameco](c ) .",
    "hence , the fact that these clouds are seen in a wide range of the lsr velocities may be consistent with them having multi - layered structures .",
    "@xcite also noted that the large velocity gradient observed in the perseus cloud may be due to the nature of multi - components superimposed along the line of sight .",
    "+    the error ranges of the estimated optical properties are a little large , especially in the value of the asymmetry factor , where the reason was attributed earlier to the statistical fluctuations of the fims data with low exposure time .",
    "nevertheless , the best fit values of the distances to the respective front face and the thicknesses of the clouds do not seem to change much when even the upper or lower limits of these error ranges are used for fitting .",
    "for example , the changes are mostly @xmath010 pc for the distances to the front faces and @xmath030 pc for the thicknesses of the clouds .",
    "the most sensitive parameters for fitting are instead the locations of the field stars as the photon sources relative to the clouds , not the optical properties of dust .",
    "we have also made a number of assumptions in the present study to obtain the optical properties of dust and the geometrical structures of the clouds in the tpa region .",
    "first , we used a conversion formula for the fuv continuum intensity of 60 cu for 1 rayleigh intensity of h@xmath18 to estimate the two - photon effects , which holds only for the case of a hot diffuse ionized gas whose temperature is @xmath08000 k @xcite . to see the effect of the choice of the conversion factor , we ran the same monte carlo simulation by but instead subtracting the two - photon effect with a conversion factor of 30 cu for 1 rayleigh of h@xmath18 in one case and even with no subtraction in another case .",
    "the results were a = 0.43 , g = 0.49 for the former case , and a = 0.44 , g = 0.52 for the latter case .",
    "all these values are within the 1-sigma range of the nominal case , a = @xmath1 and g = @xmath2 , implying that the choice of the conversion factor does not alter the conclusions made in the present study .",
    "next , we subtracted 300 cu as an isotropic background of the fuv emission , which was obtained for high galactic regions . when we subtracted 500 cu instead , only the thicknesses of the clouds changed while the distances to the respective front face remained the same .",
    "the thickness decreased by @xmath010 % for the auriga and the california clouds as well as per a , and @xmath030 % for the taurus cloud region , which is darkest of all and thus most affected .",
    "the reason for the decrease in thickness is that reduction in fuv intensity was accomplished by increasing the shielding effect in the case of these clouds . on the other hand ,",
    "the thickness of per b increased by @xmath020 pc , reflecting the nature of backward scattering in the case of per b. nevertheless , these new values are all within the 1-sigma range of the results obtained for the nominal case .",
    "we have constructed a fuv continuum map of the tpa complex using fims and galex data .",
    "the morphological features seen in the complex are well understood in terms of dust scattering , as demonstrated by monte carlo simulations .",
    "the following are the main findings of the present study :    1 .",
    "the diffuse fuv emission seen in the complex originates mostly from scattering of stellar photons by dust grains .",
    "the fuv intensity of  1000 cu is observed at a very high extinction level , which we regard as diffuse background and attribute to scattered fuv photons located in the foreground to the thick clouds .",
    "3 .   molecular hydrogen fluorescent emission constitutes @xmath010% of the total fuv intensity throughout the region .",
    "we have derived the following scattering parameters for this region based on the monte carlo radiative transfer ( mcrt ) simulations : albedo ( a ) = @xmath1 and asymmetry factor ( g ) = @xmath2 .",
    "these values agree well with those obtained previously for the orion - eridanus superbubble region as well as theoretical estimations .",
    "we have estimated the distances to the four prominent clouds in this complex , which are in good agreement with those estimated observationally using other methods .",
    "the thickness of each cloud was also reasonably determined when it has a simple structure such as the taurus cloud .",
    "the present single slab model , however , was not able to reproduce multi - layered clouds , but gives rather thick clouds , instead .",
    "the geometrical structures of the clouds are less sensitive to the exact values of the albedo and the asymmetry factor . instead , the locations of the field stars relative to the clouds are the main factors that constrain the distance and thickness of the clouds .",
