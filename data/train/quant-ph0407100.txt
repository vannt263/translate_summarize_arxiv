    "<S> the coupling coefficient is simplified as a constant @xmath6@xcite@xmath2@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the summation indexes @xmath7 represent all of relevant quantum numbers , and the electron pairs are labelled by the the quantum number @xmath8 and @xmath9 , according to the cooper pair situation where the paired electrons have equal energies but opposite momenta and spins : @xmath10 and @xmath11 . </S>",

    "<S> one can express @xmath30 in terms of the spin operators : @xmath31 where @xmath32 .    </S>",
    "<S> in fact the spin analogy of the bcs hamiltonian is well known and exact diagonalization of the pairing model in the spin space has been carried out in several previous works@xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we propose a computational simulation method which is potential to realize in future with the development of quantum computer . </S>",
    "<S> the primary advantage of our method lies in the practical realization in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> especially we can solve superconducting energy gap by this simulation method conveniently as following paragraphs . </S>",
    "<S> it is more practicably than other solution of energy gap , because it can simplify a @xmath0-dimension problem to an @xmath1-dimension problem . </S>",
    "<S> we know eigenvalues may not be solvable for high dimension matrix in principle . </S>",
    "<S> now a @xmath0-dimension problem , exponential problem(ep ) can be simplified an @xmath1-dimension problem , polynomial problem(pp ) . in the following part </S>",

    "<S> the subscripts @xmath35 representing the number of the spin - up state in the corresponding subspace are respectively @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> secondly we will prove that the eigenvalues of @xmath37 in sub1 submatrix justly are the eigenvalues of @xmath38    note the @xmath39 operator as@xmath40 whose @xmath41-th diagonal element is noted as @xmath42 $ ] @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to see the non - diagonal elements of @xmath44 are zero .    for the hamiltonian as @xmath45 , the @xmath46-th element satisfies@xmath47=\\delta_{im}\\text { \\ \\ \\ \\ } ( i , m=1,2,\\cdots , n ) </S>",

    "<S> it is easy to validate @xmath51=\\delta_{im}$ ] and the last diagonal element @xmath52 $ ] is zero . </S>",
    "<S> if when @xmath53 , @xmath54=\\delta_{im}\\text { \\ } ( i , m=1,2,\\cdots , l ) \\label{l(1)}%\\ ] ] is right and @xmath55=0 \\label{l(2)}%\\ ] ] then we should examine whether @xmath56=\\delta_{im}$ ] @xmath57 is right when @xmath58 .    we will discuss it in two cases : @xmath59 and @xmath60 .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(1 ) @xmath59 : @xmath61 from eq.([h(l+1,m ) ] ) it is easy to see@xmath62=h(l+1,m)[2x-1]=h(l+1,m)[x ] \\label{h(2x)}%\\ ] ] so@xmath63=h(l , m)[2^{l}-2^{l - i}]=\\delta_{im}\\text { \\ } ( i=1,2,\\cdots , l)\\ ] ] next we should also know the value of @xmath64 $ ] . from eq.([l(2 ) ] ) and eq.([h(2x ) ] ) there is @xmath65=h(l , m)[2^{l}]=0 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> from above discussion for @xmath66 , the equality @xmath56=\\delta_{im}$ ] is valid .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(2 ) @xmath60:@xmath67 from the above expressions the @xmath68-th diagonal element @xmath69=1 $ ] , that is to say@xmath70=1\\text { } ( i = l+1)\\ ] ] and then for @xmath71 , @xmath70=0\\ ] ] because the even - th diagonal elements are all zero obviously . </S>",
    "<S> so for @xmath60 there is also @xmath72=\\delta_{im}$ ] .    from the discussion ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) </S>",
    "<S> we have proved that when @xmath58 , @xmath56=\\delta_{im}$ ] @xmath57 is valid . </S>",
    "<S> so for @xmath73 ( @xmath1 is the natural number ) , there is the equality@xmath47=\\delta_{im}\\text { \\ \\ \\ \\ } ( i , m=1,2,\\cdots , n)\\ ] ]    after the preparation we will prove that the eigenvalues of @xmath37 in sub1 subspace justly are the energy spectrum of quasiparticle excitation of @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> firstly set a diagonal hamiltonian as @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the quasiparticle number operators . </S>",
    "<S> according to the previous analogy rule of number operators eq.([nk ] ) the spin - analogy form of @xmath77 is@xmath78 @xmath79 s submatrix in sub1 subspace is denoted as @xmath80 and the @xmath41-th diagonal element of @xmath81 as @xmath82 $ ] . we can find the @xmath41-th diagonal element of @xmath80 is the @xmath46-th diagonal element of the total hamiltonian @xmath79 . according to eq.([delta i m ] ) @xmath83   &   = h_{\\mathrm{spin}}^{\\mathrm{diag}}% [ 2^{n}-2^{n - i}]\\\\ &   = \\sum_{m=1}^{n}e_{m}h(n , m)[2^{n}-2^{n - i}]\\\\ &   = \\sum_{m=1}^{n}e_{m}\\delta_{im}\\\\ &   = e_{i}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so the spin - analogy hamiltonian of a diagonal bcs hamiltonian @xmath77  in sub1 subspace has the same eigenvalues as the diagonal bcs hamiltonian s energy spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we can deduce further that the eigenvalues of @xmath37 are justly the eigenvalues of @xmath30 whether which is diagonal or not , because @xmath30 can be written as the diagonal form like @xmath77 generally , i.e. @xmath84 , while we need not care about how to obtain the diagonal form hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> consequently it implies that if we have diagonalized @xmath37 we can get the energy spectrum of quasiparticle excitation of @xmath30 and get energy gap further avoiding complex computation . </S>",
    "<S> one of the classical methods to diagonalize @xmath30 , bogoliubov transformation method is available under the mean - field approximation , which is not exact especially in the case of limited @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> another famous method about the exact solution of bcs hamiltonian has been proposed in the 60 s by richardson@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> he considered the system with @xmath85 pairs electrons and constructed a set of operators @xmath86 @xmath87 commuted with @xmath30 , finally gave the expression of the eigenvalues @xmath88 of @xmath86 through solving the @xmath89  coupled algebraic equations . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath88 is not yet the eigenvalue of @xmath30 </S>",
    "<S> . we can more directly and simply give the energy spectrum of @xmath30 .    </S>",
    "<S> thus it can be seen the idea of diagonalizing @xmath37 instead of solving the eigenvalues of @xmath30 directly is better than those classical ones . </S>",
    "<S> now a key problem that how to get the submatrix @xmath37 is placed to the front . </S>",
    "<S> the correlative work@xcite in our group has proved that the general form of @xmath37:@xmath90=\\epsilon_{i},\\text { \\ \\ \\ } h_{sub1}[i , j]=-v\\text { \\ } % ( i , j=1,2,\\cdots , n;\\text { } i\\neq j ) \\label{wang}%\\ ] ] @xmath91 $ ] is the matrix element of @xmath37 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally it is necessary to check the methods in numerical computation . here </S>",
    "<S> we will compare our solution with the result of the mean - field approximation by the value of superconducting energy gap @xmath92 @xmath93 . according to the physics meaning of @xmath92 , </S>",
    "<S> the energy required to excite at least a quasiparticle from the fermi surface , the energy of the element excitation is written as @xmath94.@xcite in fact the element excitation energy is also the eigenvalue of @xmath30 . after getting the eigenvalue of @xmath37 , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ the eigenvalue of @xmath30 , we can get the value of @xmath92 by solving equation @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> but in order to get rid of the effect of energy zero the equation@xmath95 is used to solve @xmath92 in practice , because the difference of eigenvalues dosent depend on the energy zero and that we find the energy difference between the ground and the first excited state @xmath96 is by far larger than @xmath97 in the course of the numerical computation . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath98 and @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> the another kind of solution used in comparing is the following energy gap equation@xcite:@xmath100    here we consider the reduced bcs model whose energies are given for simplicity by @xmath101@xcite@xmath2@xcite@xmath2@xcite , here @xmath102 is the average level spacing which is inversely proportional to the size of the grains . in the strong coupling regime , corresponding to large grains or strong coupling constants , @xmath103 . in the weak coupling region , corresponding to small grains or small coupling constants , @xmath104 @xcite . from much research about ultrasmall superconducting grains@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the mean - field theory is not suitable in the weak coupling region . </S>",
    "<S> it has been proved that the corrections to the mean - field results are small in large grains become important in the opposite limit@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so in this paper we carry out the numerical computation in the first case , @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> we also take the coupling constants @xmath105 in order to discuss conveniently . in order to give the numerical pictures , </S>",
    "<S> we suppose the value of @xmath6 by the rough estimate . from bcs theory </S>",
    "<S> , the cooper pair lies in the attraction area , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ @xmath106@xcite . for metal debye energy @xmath107ev </S>",
    "<S> , we can set @xmath108ev by rough estimate . </S>",
    "<S> the estimate process is put to the later appendix . </S>",
    "<S> another two variables @xmath109 and @xmath1 are taken as the independent variables of the energy gap .    </S>",
    "<S> we list our results in diagrams . in fig.[gap - m ] setting @xmath110 , the energy gap is plotted as the function of energy level number , which is the mono - increasing function of the energy level number @xmath1 .     as a function of the number of energy level , @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we give the comparison between two results by the different methods . </S>",
    "<S> the solid line is the solution of the energy - gap equation ; the dashed line is our result by spin analogy and diagonalizing submatrix . </S>",
    "<S> here we choose @xmath108ev , @xmath110 .,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the relative error between our result and that of the eq.([gapeqold ] ) is not more than 5% in the range from @xmath111 to @xmath112 and fixed @xmath113 . </S>",
    "<S> it shows that the result from our method is well consistent with the solution of the energy gap equation . in order to check the universality of this new method </S>",

    "<S> we choose @xmath108ev.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    it is clear to see @xmath92 changes gently with @xmath109 when @xmath109 is large enough . </S>",
    "<S> that is to say , @xmath92 is almost independent of @xmath102 when @xmath102 is small enough . </S>",
    "<S> it shows the rationality of @xmath114 on the inverse hand . obviously , in fig.[gap - namda ] </S>",
    "<S> , when @xmath109 is larger than 80 , the relative error is less than 1.1% .    </S>",
