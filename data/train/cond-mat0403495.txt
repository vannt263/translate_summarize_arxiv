    "intermetallic compounds undergoing thermoelastic martensitic transformation when in the ferromagnetic state ( ferromagnetic shape memory alloys ) have attracted considerable interest ( see , for a recent review , ref .  ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that they exhibit large magnetic - field - induced strains which can be obtained either by re - orientation of martensitic variants  @xcite or by shifting the martensitic transition temperature  @xcite .",
    "in addition to this effect of practical significance , the ferromagnetic shape memory alloys have been the subject of numerous studies due to their rich phase diagrams . in particular , some of these alloys exhibit several phase transitions between different crystallographic modifications of martensite , induced by a change of composition , temperature or stress , or by the combination of these parameters .",
    "a prototype of the ferromagnetic shape memory alloys , ni@xmath5mnga , is a representative of mn - containing heusler alloys .",
    "it orders ferromagnetically at curie temperature @xmath6  k. upon cooling down to @xmath7  k it undergoes a reversible thermoelastic martensitic transformation from the heusler ( l@xmath8 ) cubic structure to a roughly tetragonal crystal structure .",
    "both @xmath9 and @xmath10 are sensitive to stoichiometry .",
    "for instance , a partial substitution of mn for ni in ni@xmath11mn@xmath12ga alloys results in an increase of @xmath9 and a decrease of @xmath10 until they couple in a composition range @xmath13 ( ref .  ) .",
    "an early neutron diffraction study  @xcite of the martensitic structure of stoichiometric ni@xmath5mnga showed that along with strong tetragonal reflections there were several additional peaks on the diffraction pattern .",
    "based on this observation , the authors suggested that the martensitic phase has a modulated crystal structure .",
    "further studies revealed  @xcite that modulation and , therefore , the crystal structure of the martensite forming from the parent austenitic phase , depends on composition ( ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "by now , five- and seven - layered martensitic phases modulated along the @xmath14 $ ] system and a non - modulated martensitic phase have been established to exist in ni - mn - ga alloys .",
    "in addition , the observation of longer - period modulations of the martensite has been reported  @xcite .",
    "the crystal structure of martensite was found to be very unstable to the application of external stresses  @xcite .",
    "it turned out that the sequence of stress - induced martensite - martensite transformations depends on many factors , such as the composition of the sample , temperature of the test , and the crystallographic direction along which the stress was applied .",
    "besides composition- or stress - induced changes in the crystal structure of martensite , some off - stoichiometric ni - mn - ga alloys undergo a sequence of temperature - induced martensite - martensite phase transitions . apart from ni - ti ( ref .   and references therein ) and ni@xmath15mn@xmath16al@xmath17 ( ref .  )",
    "systems , temperature - induced intermartensitic transitions have not been observed in other shape memory alloys .    in ni - mn - ga intermartensitic transitions are , as evident from calorimetric measurements  @xcite , first - order phase transitions .",
    "as compared with the martensitic transformation , the intermartensitic transitions exhibit several distinctive features .",
    "they are a large , exceeding 100 k , temperature hysteresis and a considerable difference in transport properties between the martensitic phases involved in an intermartensitic transition  @xcite .",
    "transport measurements of ni - mn - ga alloys undergoing intermartensitic transitions  @xcite have indicated that the difference in the resistivity between martensitic phases is comparable or even larger than that observed at the martensitic transformation temperature .",
    "this seems to be unusual because martensitic transformation has a stronger influence on the physical characteristics ( crystal structure , fermi surface , magnetic properties ) of the materials .",
    "since these features of intermartensitic transitions have not been discussed earlier we have studied and analyzed the transport properties of ni@xmath0mn@xmath1ga undergoing an intermartensitic transition . in our study",
    "we have also used a stoichiometric ni@xmath5mnga sample , prepared by the same method as ni@xmath0mn@xmath1ga .",
    "a polycrystalline ingot of ni@xmath0mn@xmath1ga composition was prepared by arc melting high purity constituent elements in argon atmosphere . in order to get a good compositional homogeneity ,",
    "the ingot was re - melted several times and annealed at 1050  k for nine days with subsequent quenching in ice water .",
    "samples for resistivity and magnetization measurements were cut from the middle part of the ingot .",
    "temperature dependencies of resistivity and magnetization were measured with a heating / cooling rate of 1  k / min by a standard four - probe technique and by a vibrating sample magnetometer , respectively .",
    "the crystal structure of the alloy was examined using a philips x - pert system in a wide temperature interval . for the powder x - ray diffraction measurements , part of the ingot",
    "was crushed into a fine powder .",
    "the powder was sealed in an evacuated quartz tube and annealed at 1050  k for five days in order to remove residual stress and improve the peak shape of diffraction patterns .",
    "the temperature dependencies of electrical resistivity of ni@xmath0mn@xmath1ga , measured upon cooling and heating , are shown in fig .  1",
    ". cooling from high temperatures results in the formation of a long - range ferromagnetic ordering at @xmath18  k which is accompanied by a change in the slope of the resistivity curve due to the decrease in electron - magnon scattering .",
    "the jump - like increase of the resistivity at @xmath19  k corresponds to the transition from the high - temperature austenitic to a low - temperature martensitic phase .    besides the change in the slope of the curve at @xmath18  k and the jump - like increase of @xmath2 at @xmath20",
    "k , one more marked change in the slope of the cooling curve is observed at @xmath21  k. since this anomaly is observed when the sample is in the martensitic state , this means that a martensite - martensite transformation occurs in ni@xmath0mn@xmath1ga .",
    "based on the results of transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) observation of a sample of this composition  @xcite , which revealed that the crystal structure of martensite in ni@xmath0mn@xmath1ga is characterized by a five - layered modulation ( 5 m ) at room temperature and seven - layered modulation ( 7 m ) at @xmath22  k , we conclude that the anomaly of @xmath2 at @xmath23  k corresponds to the onset of intermartensitic transition from a five- to seven - layered martensite ( 5 m @xmath24 7 m ) .",
    "cooling the sample below @xmath25 initially results in a distinct decrease of the resistivity , which becomes less temperature - dependent on further cooling . no anomaly corresponding to the end of the 5 m @xmath24 7 m intermartensitic transition",
    "was observed on the resistivity curve in the temperature interval of the measurements .",
    "the absence of such an anomaly implies that the fraction of the 5-layered martensite gradually decreases with decreasing temperature and therefore both the 5 m and 7 m martensitic phases coexist over a wide temperature interval .",
    "subsequent heating revealed a monotonous increase of the resistivity up to the reverse martensitic transformation temperature .",
    "mn@xmath1ga measured during cooling and heating .",
    "the inset shows the difference between @xmath2 measured upon cooling and heating , @xmath26.,width=302 ]    since the 5 m @xmath24 7 m intermartensitic transition is not completed in the studied temperature interval and because of the absence of the reverse 7 m @xmath24 5 m intermartensitic transition upon subsequent heating , the resistivity exhibits very large thermal hysteresis . at temperatures below the martensitic transformation ,",
    "the heating curve deviates from the curve measured upon cooling , and the difference between @xmath2 measured upon cooling and heating progressively increases as the temperature is increased ( inset in fig .  1 ) .",
    "assuming for simplicity that at @xmath27  k there exists only a tiny fraction of the 5 m martensite , we can estimate the difference in the resistivity between the 5 m and 7 m phases , @xmath28 . as is seen from the inset in fig .  1 , @xmath29 in a temperature interval from 283 to 300  k .",
    "due to the absence of the reverse intermartensitic transition upon heating , the behavior of @xmath2 at the martensitic transformation measured upon cooling and heating is quite different .",
    "whereas @xmath2 shows a jump - like increase during direct martensitic transformation from the parent phase to the 5 m martensite , the resistivity steepens up when approaching reverse martensitic transformation from the 7 m martensite to the parent phase ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "if the anomaly of @xmath2 at @xmath23  k indeed corresponds to the onset of the intermartensitic transition , below which the fraction of the 5 m martensite gradually decreases , the behavior of @xmath2 at martensitic transformation temperature @xmath9 should depend on the proportion of the 5 m and 7 m phases . in order to check this , we measured several partial cooling - heating cycles .",
    "mn@xmath1ga measured upon partial cooling - heating cycles in temperature intervals 286 - 333 k ( a ) , 282 - 333 k ( b ) , and 269 - 333 k ( c).,width=264 ]    the results of these measurements ( fig .  2 ) indicate that the behavior of @xmath2 at @xmath9 upon cooling is always the same ( jump - like increase ) , but that measured upon heating substantially depends on the temperature , down to which the sample was cooled . if the sample is cooled down to @xmath30 , the resistivity upon subsequent warming follows the cooling path and @xmath2 exhibits a marked jump - like decrease during transformation to the austenitic phase [ fig .",
    "this means that cooling of the sample to @xmath31  k , which is slightly higher than the @xmath25 temperature , did not result in the formation of a two - phase state and the sample remains in the 5 m martensitic state upon subsequent heating .    when the sample is cooled somewhat below @xmath25 , the behavior of resistivity at @xmath9 upon heating is still similar to that observed upon cooling .",
    "this is evident from fig .",
    "2(b ) , where the sample was cooled to @xmath32  k , i.e. 1  k below the @xmath25 temperature .",
    "this means that in the two - phase state of the sample , attained by cooling slightly below @xmath25 , the behavior of @xmath2 upon heating is governed by a considerably larger fraction of the 5 m martensite .",
    "note that in this case the heating curve is parallel to the cooling curve , indicating that the two - phase state existing at @xmath32  k is preserved up to the reverse martensitic transformation .",
    "in other words , the fraction of the 7 m martensite does not transform to the 5 m martensite upon heating from 282  k. this observation implies that the onset of the reverse intermartensitic transition is above the martensitic transformation temperature @xmath9 .    finally , when the sample is cooled down to @xmath33  k , the resistivity upon subsequent heating exhibits behavior , typical of the 7 m martensitic phase [ fig .",
    "2(c ) ] , and @xmath2 shows a small kink at the martensitic transformation temperature .",
    "in a temperature interval from 283  k to 309  k , the difference in @xmath2 between heating and cooling curves is @xmath34% , indicating that approximately 80% of the 7 m martensite had been formed upon cooling to 269  k. based on the results presented in fig .  2",
    "one can conclude that the 7 m martensite appears upon cooling below @xmath21  k and the fraction of this martensitic phase considerably exceeds that of the 5 m martensitic phase at @xmath35  k.    mn@xmath1ga measured in a 0.1  t magnetic field .",
    "the inset shows @xmath36 over the entire temperature interval.,width=264 ]    mn@xmath1ga forming upon cooling from the high - temperature austenitic phase.,width=302 ]    the magnetization @xmath3 of ni@xmath0mn@xmath1ga measured in a 0.1  t magnetic field is shown in fig .",
    "the curie temperature , determined from this measurement , is equal to 340  k ( inset in fig .  3 ) .",
    "the anomaly at @xmath37  k , exhibiting a temperature hysteresis of @xmath38  k , corresponds to the martensitic transformation . like the resistivity , the magnetization of the sample shows a large thermal hysteresis in the martensitic state . a well - defined change in the slope of the @xmath36 curve measured upon cooling at @xmath39  k corresponds to the onset of the intermartensitic transition to the 7 m phase .",
    "this characteristic temperature , determined from the magnetization measurements , is slightly lower than that obtained from the resistivity data .",
    "this difference can be accounted for by the fact that @xmath36 and @xmath40 measurements were performed on different samples . as is seen from fig .  3",
    ", in the 0.1  t magnetic field magnetization of the 5 m martensitic phase is lower than that of the 7 m phase and the difference between them gradually diminishes as the temperature is lowered .",
    "the thermal hysteresis of @xmath3 is observed only in low magnetic fields .",
    "measurements of @xmath36 in a magnetic field of 1  t showed no thermal hysteresis of @xmath3 in the martensitic state , which means that both the martensitic phases have the same magnetization in this field .",
    "therefore , it can be concluded that magnetization saturation of these two martensitic phases is the same .    the diffraction pattern of ni@xmath0mn@xmath1ga , taken at room temperature is shown in fig .",
    "4 . to be sure that the measured diffraction pattern corresponds to the 5 m martensite ,",
    "the powder was heated above the martensitic transformation temperature @xmath9 and the measurement was performed on the powder cooled to room temperature from the austenitic state .",
    "preliminary analysis of the room temperature diffraction pattern of ni@xmath0mn@xmath1ga showed that the crystal structure of the martensite formed upon cooling from the austenitic phase can be interpreted as a monoclinic one with lattice parameters @xmath41  nm , @xmath42  nm , @xmath43  nm , and @xmath44 .    x - ray diffraction measurement at a lower temperature , @xmath45  k , confirmed the occurrence of the intermartensitic transition , seen on the @xmath46 and @xmath36 curves .",
    "the crystal structure of the 7 m martensitic phase was interpreted as monoclinic with lattice parameters @xmath47  nm , @xmath48  nm , @xmath49  nm , and @xmath50 .",
    "further cooling down to @xmath51  k did not result in a change of the diffraction pattern observed at @xmath52  k. the results of these measurements are shown on an enlarged scale in fig .",
    "the results of our resistivity measurements ( fig .  1 ) indicate that different martensitic phases are considerably distinguished by their transport properties , namely @xmath53 is larger than @xmath54 by 15% .",
    "generally , this difference can be caused by two factors : by changes in the scattering probability and/or by changes in the electronic structure . since both the phases exhibit similar plate - like morphology  @xcite we suggest that the 15% difference in the resistivity of these phases can not be accounted for by an increase in the scattering centers .",
    "therefore , the origin of this difference has to be looked for in the fermi surface features .",
    "indeed , it is generally acknowledged that the formation of a long - range ordering observed in a large number of compounds is associated with the nesting properties of the fermi surface .",
    "this is true as for the case of long - range structural ordering  @xcite , as for the case of long - range magnetic ordering , such as spin- or charge - density waves  @xcite .",
    "the periodicity of long - range ordering is determined by the nesting vector on the fermi surface .",
    "it is conceivable that the various martensitic phases forming in ni - mn - ga alloys are driven by the geometry of the fermi surface that has a nesting vector corresponding to the modulation of martensite , as was suggested in  @xcite .",
    "this suggestion implies that martensitic phases with different nesting vectors have different fractions of nested fermi surface . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that the nesting considerably affects the transport properties of a metal due to the condensation of electrons in the nesting parts of the fermi surface .",
    "therefore , change in the modulation can affect the number of conduction electrons @xmath55 due to the change of the fermi surface available for conduction .    in the simple relaxation time approximation    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the effective mass",
    ", @xmath58 is the electronic charge , and @xmath59 is the relaxation time . assuming that the relaxation time @xmath59 is the same for both 5 m and 7 m martensitic phases , the experimental observation that @xmath60 indicates that the 5 m phase has a fewer number of conduction electrons @xmath55 than the 7 m phase .",
    "note that if the proposed explanation is valid , one can expect to observe an anisotropic behavior of @xmath2 in a ni - mn - ga single crystalline sample , as is the case in cr  @xcite and heavy - fermion compounds  @xcite .",
    "mn@xmath1ga performed at different temperatures upon cooling .",
    "the diffraction patterns were collected at 300  k ( a ) , 77  k ( b ) , and 10  k ( c).,width=264 ]    in the above discussion we did not consider the possibility that electron - magnon scattering can be different in the 5 m and 7 m martensites .",
    "however , according to friedel and de genner  @xcite , temperature dependence of the magnetic resistivity @xmath61 can be described as    @xmath62,\\ ] ]    where @xmath63 is the temperature independent spin - disorder resistivity and @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are magnetization saturations at a finite temperature @xmath67 and at @xmath68  k. since our magnetic measurements have shown that the magnetization saturation @xmath69 of the 5 m and 7 m phases is the same , it can be concluded that both the phases are characterized by the same electron - magnon scattering .",
    "it is apparent that , along with the unusual transport properties of ni@xmath0mn@xmath1ga discussed above , the proposed nesting hypothesis can satisfactory explain the uncommon behavior of @xmath2 at martensitic transformation temperature @xmath9 , observed in stoichiometric and near - stoichiometric ni@xmath5mnga alloys .",
    "indeed , since martensitic transformation results in a drastic change of crystal structure , fermi surface , mean free path and so on , one can expect to detect a well - defined anomaly at @xmath9 , which is indeed generally observed in shape memory alloys  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this , @xmath46 measurements for stoichiometric and near - stoichiometric ni@xmath5mnga revealed only a change in the slope of the curve at the martensitic transformation temperature  @xcite .",
    "we argue that such a peculiar behavior of @xmath2 at @xmath9 in ni@xmath5mnga is due to the premartensitic transition , occurring above @xmath9 , despite the fact that the cubic symmetry of the crystal structure is preserved upon this transition  @xcite . as is shown in fig .  6 , for the austenitic phase of stoichiometric ni@xmath5mnga @xmath46 can be fitted by a @xmath70 dependence @xmath71 .",
    "the experimental curve deviates from the fit at curie temperature @xmath6  k and at @xmath72  k which matches well with the premartensitic transition temperature @xmath73  k for the stoichiometric composition  @xcite .",
    "the driving force for the premartensitic transition is believed to be fermi surface nesting , as was suggested by zheludev _ et .",
    "@xcite , and recent theoretical calculation  @xcite supports this hypothesis .",
    "the deviation of the resistivity from the @xmath70 dependence below @xmath74 could be caused , for instance , by an increase in the relaxation time @xmath59 due to the modulation of the cubic structure in the premartensitic phase . in our opinion , however , the primary role in this process is played by the condensation of the conduction electrons in the nesting part of fermi surface .",
    "assuming that without the premartensitic transition @xmath46 would follow the @xmath70 dependence down to the martensitic transformation temperature @xmath7  k , it can be concluded from fig .",
    "6 that in this case the difference in @xmath2 between the high temperature austenitic and low temperature martensitic phases is significant and the resistivity should exhibit a jump - like behavior , as in other shape memory alloys or in off - stoichiometric ni - mn - ga .    mnga .",
    "the solid line is a fit to the experimental curve.,width=302 ]    with deviation from the stoichiometry , the martensitic transition temperature increases or decreases , depending on substitution , whereas the @xmath74 temperature is less composition dependent  @xcite . in the case of increasing @xmath9",
    "this leads to the disappearance of the premartensitic transition in a critical composition and , as a result , in off - stoichiometric ni - mn - ga alloys a marked jump - like behavior of @xmath2 is observed .",
    "temperature - induced intermartensitic transitions observed in certain ni - mn - ga alloys give rise to an anomalously large thermal hysteresis of magnetic and transport properties , which is not observed in other compounds .",
    "this thermal hysteresis is accounted for by the coexistence of both martensitic phases in a wide temperature interval . as is evident from the resistivity measurements of ni@xmath0mn@xmath1ga , the difference in @xmath2 between 5 m and 7 m martensite is about 15% , which is even larger than that observed upon the martensitic transformation",
    "we have suggested that such a significant difference is accounted for by the geometry of the fermi surface that has a different nesting vector in 5 m and 7 m martensitic phases .",
    "if this assumption is valid , an anisotropic behavior of @xmath2 in a ni - mn - ga single crystal of the same or similar composition can be reasonably expected .",
    "therefore , further studies of single crystalline samples are required for better understanding structural instability of various martensitic phases in ni - mn - ga alloys .    in the framework of the nesting hypothesis",
    "we have also discussed the peculiar behavior of @xmath2 at the martensitic transformation temperature @xmath9 in stoichiometric ni@xmath5mnga . we have argued that this behavior of @xmath2 is caused by the condensation of conduction electrons in the nesting part of the fermi surface occurring upon the premartensitic transition .",

    "we are thankful to dr  m  isobe for the help with x - ray diffraction measurements .",
    "one of the authors ( v  v  k ) gratefully acknowledges the japan society for the promotion of science ( jsps ) for a fellowship award .",
    "it is necessary to stress that the crystal structure of the martensitic phase in ni - mn - ga is still the subject of controversy .",
    "for instance , although the crystal structure of martensite in the stoichiometric ni@xmath5mnga has been described as tetragonal for a long time , recent high resolution neutron diffraction measurements ( brown  p  j _ et al _ 2002 _ j. phys . : condens . matter _ * 14 * 10159 ) imply that the martensitic phase has actually an orthorhombic crystal structure . in off - stoichiometric ni - mn - ga alloys this situation is even more complicated , which is caused by the coexistence of different martensitic phases ( inoue  k _ et al _ 2000 _ j. phys .",
