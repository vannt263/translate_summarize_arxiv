    "the correlation between radio surface brightness , @xmath0 , and diameter @xmath1 in pc in supernova remnants is parametrized as @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are are found through the radio observations @xcite .",
    "this is an observational relationship which has been explained by early theoretical models @xcite .",
    "a theoretical interpretation of the relationship has been introduced by @xcite by incorporating the sedov blast wave solution for supernovae remnant ( snr ) expansion , the generation and evolution of the magnetic field as outlined by @xcite , and the acceleration of relativistic electrons by shocks , as formulated by @xcite . the time - dependent , nonlinear kinetic theory for cosmic ray ( cr )",
    "production was adopted by @xcite in order to derive a theoretically predicted brightness - diameter relation in the radio range for the sedov phase .",
    "recently @xcite found that snrs cease to emit effectively in radio at a stage near the end of their sedov evolution , and that models of synchrotron emission with constant efficiencies in particle acceleration and magnetic field amplification do not provide a close match to the data .",
    "these previous models leave a series of questions unanswered or merely partially answered :    * is it possible to deduce a theoretical relationship on the basis of power law expansion for snr ? * is it possible to deduce a classical equation of expansion for the snr with two adjustable parameters that can be found from a numerical analysis of the radius ",
    "time relationship ? * is the theoretical relationship sensitive to the density of the interstellar medium , which decreases as a function of height above the galactic plane ?    in order to answer these questions , we develop a theoretical derivation of the relationship by modeling the expansion of a synchrotron emitting shell . in section [ sec_power ] , we show that it is reasonable to fit a power - law expansion relationship to a known young supernova remnant , sn 1987j in m81 , for which the growth of the shell like structure is available over a period of 10 years . in section [ sec_classical ] ,",
    "we discuss a modification of the power - law expansion model for the effects of the standard gradient in density in the interstellar medium . in section [ sigmadsection ]",
    ", we complete our derivation of the relationship by adopting a direct conversion of the flux of kinetic energy into radiation calibrated on the observational data ( section [ sec_observations ] ) . in section [ sec_sigmadconf ]",
    ", we address the observed fluctuations in the relationship by utilizing a new probability density function ( pdf ) for the contrast of in situ densities of snrs .",
    "this new pdf is derived from the standard number distribution of snrs with the galactic height .",
    "a standard point of view assumes that the snr expands at a constant velocity until the surrounding mass is of the order of the solar mass .",

    "another interesting snr is 1006 which started to be visible in 1006 ad and has an actual radius of @xmath22 according to @xcite .",
    "the radius in pc is a function of the the adopted distance ; as an example , @xcite quotes a distance of 2.2 kpc and @xcite 2.18 kpc .",
    "here we adopt a distance of 2.2kpc and consequently the observed radius , @xmath16 , is @xmath23 where the @xmath24 is the distance expressed in units of 2.2 kpc .",

    "table  [ datavar ] reports the numerical results .",
    "the presence of a slow wind from the sn progenitor makes it reasonable for us to assume that the snr evolves in a previously ejected medium phase in which density is considerably higher than the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the assumption used here is that the density of the ism around the snr has the following two piecewise dependencies @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a parameter that models the jump in density , @xmath32 , and is connected with the vertical profile in density as a function of the galactic height . in this framework ,",
    "the density decreases as an inverse power law with an exponent @xmath33 that can be fixed from the observed temporal evolution of the radius , with @xmath34 meaning constant density ; further on the parameter @xmath31 regulates the density at @xmath35 .",

( [ nonlinearf ] ) can be found with the fortran subroutine zriddr @xcite .",
