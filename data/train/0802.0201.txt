    "classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) are thought to accrue material from their circumstellar discs via magnetospheric accretion ( ma ) . in this paradigm ,",
    "the magnetic field of the protostar truncates the disc at a range of radii about corotation , from where the material flows along the field lines and onto the photosphere .",
    "the kinetic power of the material is thermalized in shocks ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) and is observed as a blue continuum excess ( e.g.  @xcite ) , while the hot material within the funnel flows emits strongly in permitted lines ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "observational and theoretical aspects of the ma paradigm were recently reviewed by @xcite .",
    "there is now widespread observational support for the ma model : ctts are observed to have kilogauss magnetic fields that are persistent over timescales of years ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; the line profiles of hydrogen are doppler broadened to a width comparable with the stellar escape velocity and the line profiles often show an inverse p  cygni profile that arises when an accretion funnel is viewed against a hot spot ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; time - dependent line profile studies indicate the the line profiles are modulated on the stellar rotation period ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "radiative - transfer models based on the ma paradigm are broadly successful in predicting line profile strengths and morphologies .",
    "initial models were based on an simple aligned - dipole geometry for the accretion flow , but incorporated increasingly sophisticated physics starting from a two - level atom approximation ( @xcite ) , through a full statistical equilibrium calculation under the sobolev approximation ( sa ) by @xcite , and finally including sa plus an exact integration of the line profile ( @xcite ) .",
    "the overwhelming evidence for variability , both in the continuum excess and the lines , of the emission from ctts has lead us to examine departures from axisymmetry in the accretion geometry .",
    "a crude ` curtains of accretion ' model ( @xcite ) was able to approximate rather well to the observed variability , providing that the accretion curtains had to have a relatively large azimuthal extent . a similar , tailored model for su  aur was also able to reproduce some of the observed variability characteristics ( @xcite ) .",
    "the last few years has seen the publication of a series of papers dealing with the magnetohydrodynamical modelling of accretion onto ctts ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter r02 , r03 and r04 respectively ; @xcite ) . but",
    "how well do these mhd models agree with the observational data ?",
    "the simplest test is to attempt to model continuum light curves from the hot spot distributions of the models , and such simulations can reproduce the wide variety of observed variability . in particular for models with small magnetic misalignment angles",
    "the accretion funnels may rotate faster or slower than the star ( meaning that the hot spots are not at fixed on the stellar surface ) , this naturally leads to the quasi - periodic variability that is often observed ( r04 ) .",
    "useful though such comparisons are , the line profiles themselves encode much more detailed information on the kinematics and geometry of the flow .",
    "the aim of this paper is to make a quantitative comparison between the mhd models and spectroscopic observations by computing line profiles based on the density and velocity structure of the mhd calculations .",
    "here we concentrate on three hydrogen transitions ( h@xmath0 , pa@xmath0 , and br@xmath1 ) .",
    "the h@xmath8 profile , although the strongest and most widely observed optical line , is usually contaminated by outflow emission and absorption ( e.g. @xcite ) and can not be modelled by ma alone , instead requiring a hybrid code incorporating both accretion and outflow ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the h@xmath0 line is a better proxy for accretion , and observationally the near - ir lines show a high frequency of inverse p  cygni morphology , indicating that they too are better probes of the accretion geometry ( @xcite ) .    in the following section we describe the mhd model and the radiative - transfer model , and we give the results of our profile calculations in section  3 .",
    "we discuss our results in comparison with both earlier radiative - transfer models and observations in section  4 , and our conclusions are presented in section  5 .",

    "is adjusted such that to be parallel to the magnetic field @xmath17 at @xmath18 which corresponds to a frozen - in condition .",
    "matter falls to the surface of the star supersonically and most of its energy is expected to be radiated in the shock wave close to the surface of the star ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "evolution of the radiative shock wave above the surface of cttss has been considered in detail by @xcite . in this paper",

    "numerical simulations have shown that the inner regions of the disk are disrupted by the magnetosphere of the star and matter flows to a star in two high - density funnels streams under some situations .",

    "the important parameters are the initial densities in the disk @xmath21 and corona @xmath22 , and the initial temperatures in the disk @xmath23 and corona @xmath24 .",
    "these values are determined at the fiducial point at the boundary between the disk and corona ( at the inner radius of the disk ) .",
    "we took parameters @xmath25 , @xmath26 and obtained supersonic funnel streams since the sound speed is relatively low , @xmath27 .",
    "the funnel flow converges towards the star and temperature increases due to adiabatic heating . in reality",
    ", the temperature may decrease due to radiative cooling . to mimic the effect of the radiative cooling we performed most of these new runs at smaller adiabatic index @xmath28 .",
    "this is the main difference of the new runs compared to r04 runs .",
    "in addition , we increased the magnetic field of the star by a factor of two compared to r04 .",
    "this led to larger magnetospheric gaps compared to r04 .",
    "we have adopted the following mhd input parameters from a typical ctts .",
    "the mass and the radius of the star are assumed to be @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively .",
    "the magnetic field at the surface of the star ( at the equator ) is assumed to be @xmath31 .",
    "the size of the simulation region corresponds to @xmath32 .",
    "the unit of time used in the model is @xmath33  d which corresponds to a period of keplerian rotation at @xmath34 which is the unit distance used in fig .",
    "[ fig : density - zx ] .",
    "the star rotates with period @xmath35 which corresponds to many cttss ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the accretion disc is stopped by the magnetosphere at the distance @xmath36 .",
    "this distance is slightly below the corotation radius of the star @xmath37 .",
    "this situation approximately corresponds to the rotational equilibrium state in which a star does not gain or lose angular momentum on average ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we consider the case with typical value of corona temperature and the disc density are set @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( e.g.  @xcite ) respectively .",
    "r03 and r04 showed that the geometry of the accretion stream strongly depends on @xmath3 ; hence , we consider cases with a wide range of @xmath3 angles , specifically @xmath20 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "[ fig : density - zx ] shows the density slices of the 3-d simulations on the planes defined by the rotation axes and the misaligned magnetic axes .",
    "the figure shows the accretion occurs in two streams ( as mentioned earlier ) , and the flows encounter the stellar surface near the magnetic poles ( see r04 for their relative locations ) .",
    "we choose the time slices of these mhd simulations at which the flows are semi - steady and has a similar accretion rate ( @xmath42 ) for a comparison and for the radiative transfer models presented in the following sections .",
    "this mass - accretion rate chosen here is very similar to that of a typical ctts seen in the observations ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the radiative transfer code torus ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite :",
    "@xcite : @xcite ) was extended to incorporate the density , velocity and gas temperature structures from the 3-d mhd simulations of r04 mentioned above .",
    "the radiative transfer code uses the three - dimensional ( 3d ) adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) grid , and it allows us an accurate mapping of the original mhd simulation data onto the radiative transfer grid .",
    "although it is possible , we do not explore the line variability due to the time - dependent nature of the accretion in this paper .",
    "the aspect we investigate here is the variability due to the change in the viewing angles ( of an observer ) due to the rotational motion of a star and its magnetosphere .",
    "for this reason , we select outputs of mhd simulation which have ( relatively ) quiet stage , i.e. we choose the time stage of simulations which reached a ( semi- ) steady state .",
    "we emphasise that the variability associated with the time - dependent nature of the flow ( e.g.  due to instabilities ) is certainly worth pursuing in the future since it provides us an opportunity to study the kinematics of the accretion flow itself ; hence , it would provide us an additional constraint on the geometry of the magnetosphere around ctts .",
    "this is beyond the scope of this paper , but should be considered in a future work .",
    "the basic steps for computing the line variability are as follows : ( 1 ) mapping of the mhd simulation output onto the radiative transfer grid , ( 2 ) the source function ( @xmath43 ) calculation and ( 3 ) the observed flux / profile calculation as a function of rotational phase . in the second step ,",
    "we use the method of @xcite ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ) in which the sobolev approximation method is applied .",
    "the population of the bound states of hydrogen are assumed to be in statistical equilibrium , and the gas to be in radiative equilibrium .",
    "our hydrogen atom model consists of 14 bound states and a continuum .",
    "readers are referred to @xcite for details .",
    "monte carlo radiative transfer ( e.g. @xcite ) , under the sobolev approximation , is valid when ( 1 ) a large velocity gradient is present in the gas flow , and ( 2 ) the intrinsic line width is negligible compared to the doppler broadening due to the bulk ( macroscopic ) motion of gas . in our earlier models ( @xcite ;",
    "@xcite ) , this method was adopted since these conditions are satisfied . however , as noted and demonstrated by @xcite , even with a moderate mass - accretion rate ( @xmath44 ) , stark broadening becomes important in the optically thick h@xmath8 line .",
    "in addition , h@xmath8 is most likely affected by the wind absorption and emission components ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , but the original mhd simulations ( r03 ; r04 ) do not contain outflow / wind components . for these reasons",
    "we avoid modelling h@xmath8 , and concentrate on lines less likely to be affected by wind and stark broadening , i.e.  pa@xmath0 ( mainly ) , br@xmath1 , and h@xmath0 in this paper .    when importing the mhd simulations results ( fig .",
    "[ fig : density - zx ] ) to the radiative transfer calculations , we have introduced a cut - off radius ( @xmath45  cm @xmath46 ) although the radial range of the mhd simulations extend much larger than this value .",
    "the cut - off radius corresponds @xmath47 in fig .",
    "[ fig : density - zx ] .",
    "this indicates that the puffed - up density structures in the disc seen in the mhd simulations are not included in the radiative transfer models , and the problems are rather focused on the accretion funnel parts .",
    "this is done to avoid the complications of adding dust opacity and finding dust temperature , and to avoid very high density and low temperature regions in which the source function calculation may have some difficulty . beyond this cut - off radius",
    ", we simply inserted a ` optically thick and geometrically thin disc ' which is essentially a geometrical disc with no thickness and with infinitely large opacity through which no radiation can penetrate .",
    "this type of disc was adopted to imitate the obscuration of the accretion funnels and stellar surface by a optically thick disk .",
    "although we understand the importance of including the puffed - up regions of the disc and the dust for the line variability problems in very high inclination system , currently our model are not be able handle the regions correctly .",
    "the temperature structure of the magnetosphere used by @xcite is computed by assuming a volumetric heating rate which is proportional to @xmath48 , by solving the energy balance of the radiative cooling rate ( see table  1 in @xcite ) and the heating rate .",
    "however , in this formulation , the normalisation is arbitrary , and it has to be determined from the multiple line fitting . on the other hand , @xcite presented a self - consistent determination of the thermal structure of the inflowing gas , along the same dipole magnetic field geometry as in @xcite , by solving the heat equation coupled to the rate equations for hydrogen .",
    "he found that main heat source is adiabatic compression due to the converging nature of the flow , and the major contributors to the cooling process are bremsstrahlung radiation and line emission from ca@xmath49 and mg@xmath49 ions .",
    "@xcite found that the line profile models computed according to the temperature structure of @xcite do not agree with observations , unlike profiles based on the ( less self - consistent ) @xcite temperature distribution .",
    "it is clear that the temperature structure of the magnetosphere is still a large source of uncertainty in the accretion model , and this issue should certainly be investigated more carefully in the future .    in this paper",
    "we simply consider following three cases of the temperature structure of the flow : ( 1 )  hartmann - like cooling / heating case , ( 2 )  adiabatic cooling / heating only case ( directly from the mhd calculation ) , and ( 3 ) isothermal case . in case of ( 2 ) , we find that the gas temperature from the mhd is in general too high ( no radiative cooling ) ; hence , we introduce a scaling factor @xmath50 which is multiplied with the original temperature ( @xmath51 ) of the mhd simulations , i.e.   @xmath52 .",
    "this is somewhat similar to an arbitrary normalisation constant introduced in ( 1 ) .",
    "note in all the models presented in this paper , @xmath53 and the mhd models results with the adiabatic index @xmath28 ( c.f .",
    "basic results of the dependency of line profiles will be presented in section  [ sec : result_temp_structure ] . in the following sections , ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) will be refer to as the hch and ach temperature structures , respectively .",
    "we adopt stellar parameters of a typical classical t  tauri star used by r04 for the central continuum source to be consistent with their mhd simulations , i.e.   its stellar radius @xmath54 and its mass @xmath55 ( see section 2.1 ) .",
    "consequently , we adopt the effective temperature of the photosphere @xmath56 and the surface gravity @xmath57 ( cgs ) , and use the model atmosphere of @xcite as the photospheric contribution to the continuum flux .",
    "the parameters are summarised in table  [ tab : stellar_parameters ] .",
    "additional continuum sources to be included are the hot spots formed by the infalling gas along the magnetic field on to the stellar surface .",
    "as the gas approaches the surface , it decelerates in a strong shock , and is heated to @xmath58 .",
    "the x - ray radiation produced in the shock will be absorbed by the gas locally , and re - emitted as optical and uv light ( @xcite ; @xcite )  forming the high temperature regions on the stellar surface with which the magnetic field intersects .",
    "while @xcite , @xcite and @xcite used a single temperature model for hot spots assuming the free - falling kinetic energy is thermalized in the radiating layer , and is re - emitted as blackbody radiation , we adopt the multi - temperature hot spot model of r04 in which the temperature of the hot spots is also determined by conversion of kinetic energy plus internal energy of infalling gas to radiation energy ( as a blackbody ) .",
    "they considered the position dependent matter flux crossing the inner boundary ; hence , achieving a position dependent temperature of the hot spot , which can be written as @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the pressure , the density , the radial component of velocity and the speed of gas / plasma , respectively .",
    "further more , @xmath64 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , and @xmath65 is the specific enthalpy of the gas : @xmath66 .",
    "a typical temperature ( area - weighted mean ) of the hotspots is around 8000  k in our models .",
    "we compare this temperature @xmath67 with the effective temperature of photosphere @xmath68 to determine the shape of the hot spots .",
    "if @xmath69 , then the location on the stellar surface is flagged as hot .",
    "for the hot surface , the total continuum flux is the sum of the blackbody radiation with @xmath67 and the flux from the model photosphere mentioned above .",
    "the contribution from the inflow gas is ignored when @xmath70 .",
    "using pa@xmath0 as an example , the general characteristics of line variability computed by the radiative transfer model will be presented in this section .",
    "we present models with 5 different combinations of the misalignment angle @xmath3 and inclination angle @xmath2 , as summarised in table  [ tab : model_parameters ] .",
    "first , we present the continuum variability of our models .",
    "second , we briefly discuss the dependency of the models on the temperature structures ( c.f .  section  [ sec : temp_structure ] ) .",

    "the mass - accretion rate ( @xmath71 ) and the inner radius ( @xmath72 ) of the accretion disc used in our models are also shown in the same table .",
    "since the line variability is closely related with the continuum variability , we present the light curves predicated by the models before we present the line variability results .",
    "r04 also presented the light curves of the 3-d mhd simulations which are basically identical to ours .",
    "their light curves were computed by using frequency - integrated flux and do not contain an optically thick disc which would obscure the stellar photosphere and accretion hot spots at high inclination angles . on the other hand , our model computes the light curves at a given wavelength , and contains an optically - thick and geometrically thin disc . fig .

    "a similar trend was also observed by r04  see their fig .",
    "as @xmath2 becomes greater than @xmath78 , the peak amplitude does not change greatly since a part of the second hot spot on the lower hemisphere becomes visible at higher inclinations .",
    "the visibility of the second hot spots affects the shape of the light curve . in model",
    "a and b , only one hot spot ( on the upper hemisphere ) is visible during the whole or parts of rotational phase ; hence , their light curves exhibit a single peak in one rotational phase . on the other hand ,",

    "the profiles computed with the hch and ach are very similar to each other  they have similar flux in both wings , but the core flux of the hch model is slightly larger than that of the ach model . on the other hand , the isothermal model produces an inverse p - cygni ( ipc ) profile with a shallower absorption wing .",
    "the difference is mainly caused by the warmer gas stream present in the outer part of the magnetosphere ( where absorption occurs ) compared to that of the hch and ach models .",
    "the core flux of the isothermal case is very similar to that of the hch model .",
    "overall , the profile shapes from all three temperature structures are very similar to each other . from this exercise",
    ", we find that the main physical conditions which determines the profile shapes , _ for a fixed mean temperature condition _ _",
    ", are the velocity field and the geometry of the funnel flows . in other words , as long as the mean temperature is similar , the difference in the temperature structure along the stream does not make a significant difference in line profiles at least at the temperature used here ( 8000  k ) .",
    "since we find no large difference between the profiles from the hch and ach temperature structures , we adopt the latter ( with @xmath93 ) in the models presented in the following sections unless specified otherwise . _ _ _     with three different temperature structures of the accretion stream with @xmath20 and @xmath88 ( model  b ) at the rotational phase @xmath89 .",
    "three cases considered here are : ( 1 )  the ach model : the temperature structure from r04 ( solid ) , ( 2 )  the hch model : temperature structure from @xcite ( dotted ) , and ( 3 )  an isothermal ( @xmath94 ) case ( dashed ) .",
    "the normalisation of the temperature structure scalings are chosen such that the mass - weighted mean temperature ( @xmath91 ) of the flow is comparable to that of the isothermal case , i.e. @xmath95 .",
    "overall shapes of the profiles are very similar to each other , but the absorption in the red wing is slightly shallower for the isothermal case compared to the other two cases .",
    "the difference in the temperature structure in the accretion funnels does not make a significant difference in the profile shape as long as the mean temperature of the flows is similar . ]",
    ".reference model parameters [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      in the previous section ( section  [ sec : results ] ) , we presented the ` rotationally modulated ' variability of the spectra based on the mhd simulations .",
    "we observed that the variability associated with the absorption in the red wing reaches up to 3040  per  cent ( c.f .",
    "[ fig : var_theta_fixed ] , [ fig : var_i_fixed ] and [ fig : var_lines_model_b ] ) .",
    "here we briefly examine whether such rotationally modulated variability can be observed when , in reality , the accretion rate through the funnels to the stellar surface may also vary in time .",
    "the mhd simulations have shown that in many cases the mass - accretion rate ( @xmath96 ) to the stellar surface reaches quasi - stationary states , but the mass flux continues to vary on a time - scale of 35  d , which is similar to the rotationally modulated time - scale ( @xmath97  d ) .",
    "thus the line profile variability induced by the stellar rotation may be complicated by the intrinsic variation of the accretion rate .",
    "however , the mhd simulations show that in one of the main cases ( @xmath98 and @xmath28 ) , the accretion rate @xmath96 is almost constant , and varies only at the level of 56  per  cent . in this case",
    ", we expect that the effect of the intrinsic variability on the line variability is relatively small , and the results presented in the previous section are not affected significantly .",
    "on the other hand , in case for @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) , we find that the variation of @xmath96 occurs at the level of 1030  per  cent .",
    "we expect in this case , the line profile variability to be affected by the change in @xmath96 , which occurs on a similar time scale as the rotational period but varies rather stochastically",
    ". the line variability will be a mixture of periodic signals from stellar rotation and rather random signals from the change in @xmath96 .",
    "however , we expect that in this case long simulation runs will help to separate the contribution from this large but random component ( caused by the change in @xmath96 ) from the total line variability .",
    "although not explicitly shown here , the funnel flow velocities near the inner edge of the accretion disc are rather slow and subsonic .",
    "for example in models a , b , and c ( @xmath20 cases ) , the flow velocities are very similar to the one shown in fig .  5 ( right panel ) of @xcite in which the mach number of the gas flow in the middle of the funnel flow is plotted as a function of distance from the star ( along the stream line ) .",
    "the plot shows that most of the flow is in fact supersonic except for the gas near the disc .",
    "the sobolev approximation used in the radiative transfer models is not quite valid in the subsonic part of the flow ; however , most of the line emission occurs in the funnel flow near the stellar surface ( c.f .  figs .",
    "[ fig : summary_models_abc ] and  [ fig : summary_models_de ] ) , and the line of sight to the emission region does not pass through the slow moving part of the funnel flow near the inner edge of accretion disc , except for a very high inclination case .",
    "for this reason , the sobolev approximation used in the line profile models presented here should be a reasonable assumption , provided that the intrinsic line width is negligible compared to the doppler broadening due to the bulk ( macroscopic ) motion of gas .    in section  [ sub : compariosn - with - observation ] , we noted that the possibility of additional line broadening mechanisms besides the the doppler may be important for explaining much larger fwhms seen in the observed pa@xmath0 , compared to those from our models . @xcite and",
    "@xcite considered stark broadening which is important in optically thick lines e.g.  h@xmath8 , but less likely important for pa@xmath0 and br@xmath1 lines .",
    "another possible cause of line broadening is due to large turbulent motion of plasma which could be caused by alfvn waves excited in the magnetosphere ( c.f .",
    "if the magnitude of turbulent velocity is comparable to that of the local thermal velocity , the assumption of the sobolev approximation becomes invalid .",
    "the mhd simulations presented in this paper do not show such turbulent motions ; hence , we have simply adopted the sobolev approximation in the work presented here . on the other hand ,",
    "if large turbulence is found in the mhd simulations , the radiative transfer models should abandon the sobolev approximation and used an alternative method e.g.  the ray - by - ray integration method in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although very successful in explaining many ctts emission line features , the ma model of @xcite are axi - symmetric ( 2.5-d ) ; hence , they can not predict the line variability associated with stellar rotation . on the other hand ,",
    "their model still can predict line variability caused by a non - constant mass - accretion rate .",
    "@xcite introduced the disc wind  ma hybrid model by combining the models of @xcite and @xcite i.e. including both outflows and inflows from and to the ctts .",
    "the model was successful in reproducing the wide variety of h@xmath8 profile shapes seen in observations , and it demonstrated the importance of a wind or outflow component in determining the profiles shapes of h@xmath8 .",
    "their models were also axi - symmetric , and did not consider line variability .    the same dipole ma model as in @xcite and @xcite",
    "are used in the 3-d monte carlo radiative transfer model of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "they have modified the magnetosphere by removing the flow within some azimuthal angle ranges , and then displaced the magnetic poles from the rotational poles to imitate the flow geometry found in the mhd simulation of r03 and r04 , to simulate a possible line variability for @xmath88 case .",
    "the misalignment angle used in this model ( their a30 model ) is rather small ( @xmath100 ) , and it is very similar to our @xmath20 models .",
    "although the line strength is much weaker than our model  b ( which also uses @xmath88 ) , the variability pattern seen in their rms spectra and the quotient spectra image ( see their figure  9 ) are very similar to ours ( fig .  [",
    "fig : var_theta_fixed ] ) .",
    "the difference in the line strength is caused by the difference in the adopted mass - accretion rate and the mass - weighted mean temperature between the two models .",
    "we have presented a series of 3-d monte carlo radiative transfer calculations of the line variability from ctts induced by stellar rotation using the results of the 3-d mhd simulations of @xcite who considered the accretion onto the ctts with a misaligned dipole axis with respect to the rotational axis .",
    "our model here does not include an outflow component , and is restricted to the case of accretion flow through the magnetosphere .",
    "main objectives here were firstly to examine whether the 3-d mhd simulations would be able to reproduce the types of line profiles and the line variability seen in observations , and secondly to examine how the line variability depends on basic physical parameters . in the following , we will summarise our main findings though this investigation .",
    "( 1 )  the detail of the temperature structure along the accretion funnel flow does not affect the line shapes greatly ( section  [ sec : result_temp_structure ] ) .",
    "for a fixed ( density - weighted ) mean temperature ( @xmath91 ) of the accretion flow , we have considered three different temperature structures ( hch , ach and isothermal c.f .",
    "section  [ sec : temp_structure ] ) , and found the resulting pa@xmath0 profiles are very similar to each other , at least with @xmath101 .",
    "the line shapes are more sensitive to the inclination of the systems , the geometry and hence the velocity field of the accretion flow .",
    "( 2 )  by comparing our models with the atlas of observed pa@xmath0 and br@xmath1 profiles of @xcite , we found models with a smaller misalignment angle ( e.g. @xmath20 ) produce rather symmetric profiles which are seen in the majority of the observed sample .",
    "the models with mid to high misalignment angles produces double - peaked profiles ( type  ii - r : @xcite ) which are very rare in the sample of @xcite .",
    "this may also suggest that the majority of the ctts have a rather small misalignment angle .",
    "( 3 )  we find that the line equivalent width variability is closely related with the visibility of the hot spots on the stellar surface ( section[sub : line - equivalent - width ] ) . for a high inclination system with a small dipole misalignment angle ( e.g.  model  c ) , only one accretion of funnel ( on the upper hemisphere ) is visible to an observer at any given rotational phase ; hence , the anti - correlation of the ew in the blue wing and that in the red wing can occur during half of a rotational period , specifically when the hot spot is not visible to the observer ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ew_pab ] ) .",
    "( 4 )  based on our line profile models , we find that the mhd models of @xcite are capable of reproducing line profile variability behaviour similar to those seen in observations ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) although the original temperature predicted by the mhd models had to be lowered by an arbitrary scaling factor in the radiative transfer calculation due to lack of a proper cooling mechanism in the mhd model ( c.f .  sections  [ sec : temp_structure ] ) .    despite of the relatively good agreement between our models and observed line variability ,",
    "several issues still remain .",
    "first , the assumption of the sobolev approximation used in the radiative transfer calculation may not be valid in the funnel flow near the inner edge of the accretion disc where the speed of flow is substantially subsonic .",
    "relaxing this assumption may be more important in the observed flux calculation than in the source function calculation according to the finding of @xcite who compared line profiles computed in 1-d ( spherical geometry ) , using three different radiative transfer methods including the sobolev approximation method .",
    "detailed investigation of the validity of the sobolev approximation in the context of the magnetospheric accretion is underway , and shall be presented in a future paper ( harries et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "second , the model presented here does not include a wind component .",
    "although the effect of the wind on the line profile shapes are expected to be small in pa@xmath0 and br@xmath1 , it could potentially have significant effects on h@xmath0 and h@xmath8 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "strong wind absorption components are also seen the optically thick he@xmath49  @xmath10210830 line ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these spectroscopic observations combined with models ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) provide us with opportunities to constrain little known physical properties ( e.g.  geometry and temperature ) of the wind / outflow in sub - au scales .",
    "however , as the mhd models used in this paper do not include the outflow , we are not be able to explore the possible effect of the wind contribution to line variability . in principle , our radiative transfer model can be applied to a system which includes both the ma flow and the wind once a result of such mhd calculations becomes available .",
    "strict tests of our models should be performed by quantitative fitting of the time - series observations of multiple lines ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) with good rotational phase coverages .",
    "the different lines are formed in different volumes within the funnels and give us additional information on the flow kinematics .",
    "the spectra from different rotational phases provides information on how the magnetosphere changes in azimuthal direction .",
    "once the validity of the model is established , it can be used to constrain the complex geometry of the ma flows around ctts .",
    "it would be very interesting to compare the geometry constrained by this method to the ones determined from the field extrapolation method ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) using the stellar surface magnetic field information via the zeeman - doppler imaging technique , obtained with a modern stellar spectropolarimeter such as espadons ( @xcite ) .    while our underlying assumption of the magnetic field geometry is pure dipole , a more complex field geometry , such as in @xcite who considered the combination of a dipole and a quadrupole fields in their mhd models ,",
    "should be also considered in the line variability calculations .",
    "for example , some ctts are known to posses non - dipole magnetic fields ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we shall also consider the case with a non - constant mass - accretion rate model .",
    "for example , a recent mhd calculation by kulkarni & romanova in preparation ( see @xcite ) has shown that variable mass - accretion rates could occur due to instabilities ( rayleigh - taylor and kelvin - helmholtz ) in the ma flow .",
    "these add another level of complexity in the interpretation of observed line profiles , and their variability .",
