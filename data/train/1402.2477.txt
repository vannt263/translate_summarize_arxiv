    "the advent of high - luminosity beams at modern accelerator facilities such as cebaf ( continuous electron beam accelerator facility ) at jefferson lab has opened the way for dedicated programs of nucleon structure measurements with unprecedented precision .",
    "the data have allowed phenomena such as quark - hadron duality and the transition to scaling in transverse and longitudinal nucleon structure functions to be accurately verified , as well as precision studies to be conducted of the flavor and spin structure of the proton in kinematic regions previously inaccessible ( see , _ e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , the region of large parton ( quark ) momentum fraction ( @xmath15 ) , which is experimentally challenging because of the small cross sections involved , has seen a resurgence of interest in recent years @xcite , especially at jefferson lab with its unique access to large @xmath0 .",
    "part of this interest has been the promise to resolve decades - long questions about parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) at large @xmath0 , such as the behavior of the unpolarized @xmath13 or polarized @xmath16 ratios in the @xmath14 limit . at large four - momentum transfer",

    ", one needs electron scattering data from both proton and neutron targets .",
    "however , while experiments have been able to map out in great detail the characteristics of the proton at large @xmath0 , determining the corresponding structure of the neutron has proved to be much more difficult .    at lower values of @xmath8 ( of order 1 gev@xmath9 ) , the large-@xmath0 region",
    "is dominated by nucleon resonances , among which the @xmath18 is the lowest - mass excitation .",
    "a fundamental question here is whether the ratio @xmath19 of neutron to proton inclusive electron scattering cross sections for the @xmath20 transition is unity , as would be expected for a pure isovector transition ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "existing deuteron electroproduction data @xcite indicate that the isotensor ( @xmath22 ) contribution is small but non - negligible .",
    "similarly , comparing inclusive cross sections on the neutron with those on the proton for the higher - lying ( overlapping ) resonance excitations can provide constraints on the isospin structure of the resonant and non - resonant contributions to the total cross section .",
    "finally , neutron structure functions in the resonance region are needed to conclusively test bloom - gilman duality @xcite in the neutron .",
    "the absence of free neutron targets has meant that in practice light nuclei such as the deuteron and @xmath23he are routinely used as effective neutron targets . in regions of kinematics",
    "where most of the neutron s momentum is carried by a single valence quark , or where the spectrum is dominated by resonances , different choices for models of nuclear corrections can lead to significant uncertainties in the neutron cross sections @xcite . consequently our ability to determine unambiguously the isospin structure of the nucleon pdfs , as well as the spectrum of the excited states of the nucleon , has been severely limited .",
    "for example , in the nucleon resonance region there are large uncertainties in the neutron to @xmath24 transition helicity amplitudes extracted from deuteron measurements , while in the deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) region the @xmath1-quark pdf is poorly determined beyond @xmath25 . aside from the intrinsic value of such knowledge ,",
    "a practical ramification is that the large-@xmath0 pdf uncertainties can in some cases propagate to influence production rates of particles , including those predicted beyond the standard model , at high - energy colliders such as the large hadron collider @xcite .    to move beyond this impasse ,",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that one can minimize the nuclear model uncertainties by selecting ( or `` tagging '' ) final states in the electron ",
    "deuteron scattering process in which the proton is produced with small momentum in the backward hemisphere relative to the momentum transfer .",
    "this minimizes the probability of rescattering of the `` spectator '' proton with the rest of the hadronic debris , thereby ensuring that the reaction took place on a neutron close to its mass shell @xcite .",
    "the first direct extraction of inclusive scattering data on a nearly free neutron using this spectator tagging technique was performed with the bonus ( barely off - shell nucleon structure ) experiment at jefferson lab , which ran in 2005 in hall  b using clas and a novel radial time projection chamber ( rtpc ) capable of detecting protons with momenta down to 70  mev/@xmath3 . in a first report @xcite , a representative sample of the bonus neutron spectra was presented , allowing a first glimpse into the inclusive neutron excited mass spectrum and the neutron @xmath5 structure function at large @xmath0 , essentially free of nuclear correction uncertainties . in this paper",

    "we discuss the accuracy of the nuclear impulse approximation used to extract the neutron structure function from the semi - inclusive cross section , and examine various corrections to the ia from final - state interactions and nucleon off - shell effects .",
    "there are a number of reasons why knowledge of the free neutron structure functions is vital for our understanding of the quark structure of the nucleon , and nonperturbative qcd more generally . in the nucleon resonance region ,",
    "an accurate determination of neutron structure functions is needed for the extraction of the full isospin dependence of the resonant and nonresonant contributions to the inclusive neutron cross section .",
    "knowledge of the neutron resonance structure is also needed for the model - independent verification of bloom - gilman duality in the neutron @xcite , and for understanding the transition between the resonance and deep - inelastic regions .",
    "while existing model - dependent studies @xcite suggest a common origin of duality for the neutron and proton , proof of this requires neutron resonance data that are free of nuclear model assumptions .",
    "unfortunately , the absence of high - density , free neutron targets has usually forced neutron structure to be extracted from inclusive scattering experiments on nuclear targets , such as the deuteron .",
    "such extractions , however , necessarily involve model - dependent methods to account for nuclear effects in the deuteron @xcite .",
    "the extraction of the neutron structure function in the resonance region from inclusive nuclear data is particularly challenging because of fermi smearing , which acts to reduce the distinctiveness of the resonance peaks from the nonresonant background @xcite .    of course , definitive tests of quark - hadron duality must involve data from both the resonance and dis regions .",
    "for the latter , the parton model allows the structure of the nucleon to be characterized in terms of the nucleon s valence @xmath28- and @xmath1-quark momentum distributions . following many years of dis and other high - energy scattering experiments ,",
    "a detailed picture has emerged of the structure of the nucleon at intermediate and small values of bjorken @xmath0 .",
    "the abundance of high - precision proton structure function ( @xmath29 ) data has , due to the preferential coupling of the photon to @xmath28 quarks compared with @xmath1 quarks in the proton , allowed an accurate determination of the @xmath28-quark pdf at both small and large values of @xmath0 .     from the cj global pdf analysis @xcite .",

    "the uncertainties associated with the nuclear corrections propagate to the extracted neutron structure functions , and hence to the @xmath32 ratio @xcite .",
    "the results for @xmath32 from a recent global fit by the cteq - jefferson lab ( cj ) collaboration @xcite are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_cjnp_ratio ] , showing both the uncertainties from nuclear corrections and experiment .",
    "beyond @xmath33 the current data not only prevent us from understanding the basic nonperturbative dynamics responsible for the behavior of @xmath13 in the @xmath14 limit , for which predictions range from 0 to @xmath34 @xcite , but can also impact our ability to reliably compute qcd cross sections in high - energy collider experiments which have sensitivity to the @xmath1-quark pdf @xcite .",
    "measurement of the free neutron structure function would also allow for a model - independent determination of the size of the nuclear correction in the deuteron through the construction of the @xmath35 ratio .",
    "this would provide data that could discriminate between various detailed models of nuclear effects in the deuteron @xcite , thereby solving the decades - long question about the magnitude of the nuclear emc effect in the deuteron .",
    "finally , reliable parametrizations for @xmath5 are needed to extract ratios of nuclear to nucleon structure functions from inclusive measurements on nuclear targets , and on spin structure functions from polarization asymmetries in inclusive scattering .",
    "since the deuteron is a weakly bound system with binding energy @xmath36  mev ( only about 0.1% of the deuteron mass ) , on average the deuteron structure function may be reasonably well approximated by a sum of free proton and neutron structure functions . at large values of @xmath0 ,",
    "however , the deuteron structure functions receive increasingly greater contributions from nucleons carrying a larger fraction of the deuteron s momentum .",
    "these contributions are sensitive to the details of the high - momentum tails of the deuteron wave function , which are not as well constrained by nucleon ",
    "nucleon scattering data as the low - momentum components .",
    "consequently , in the high-@xmath0 region there is a more significant dependence on the model for the smearing of the nucleon structure due to binding and fermi motion effects , as well as to possible modifications of nucleon structure when the nucleon is off its mass shell .",
