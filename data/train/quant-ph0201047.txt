    "the goal of loqc is to build a quantum computer that uses photons to encode information , but does not require any nonlinear medium to allow the photons to interact . instead , we will only use single photon sources , beam splitters , phase shifters , and photon detectors which are able to distinguish between @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , ... photons . according to the original scheme for loqc , each qubit",
    "is represented by a single photon in a superposition of two optical modes .",
    "the conventional notation is @xmath5 here the logical value of @xmath2 corresponds to the eigenstate that has zero photons in optical mode @xmath3 and one photon in optical mode @xmath4 , and the logical @xmath3 state has one photon in mode @xmath3 and zero photons in mode @xmath4 .",
    "we will describe a phase shifter using the phase angle @xmath6 that it imparts to a single photon , and @xmath7 is the unitary transformation that acts on the state of the photons traveling through the phase shifter @xmath8 . for example @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "beam splitters @xmath11 are similarly described using two angles , @xmath12 and @xmath6 .",
    "they are usually represented by the rotation matrix that transforms the photon creation operators @xmath13 into their primed versions in the heisenberg picture @xmath14 because any large unitary matrix can be written as a direct product of two by two unitary matrices , we can describe the action of many beam splitters on any number of optical modes by giving the matrix that is the direct product of the matrices describing each beam splitter and phase shifter .",
    "suppose then that @xmath15 is such a matrix describing the transformation of many optical modes ; the elements of @xmath15 are written as @xmath16 ; and @xmath17 is the unitary operator acting on photon states in the schrdinger picture . to find how a fock state is transformed by @xmath17",
    "we must compute @xmath18 this formalism allows us to generalize the concept of beam splitters to include a much wider class of devices , all of which can be constructed by collections of single mode phase shifters and conventional two mode beam splitters @xcite .",
    "the first element of a loqc is a device called @xmath19 that will shift the phase of a mode containing two photons , but will leave a single photon undisturbed .",
    "@xmath19 performs the transformation @xmath20 .",
    "the three modes are then sent through a network of beam splitters described by the matrix @xmath21 after passing through the network , the state of the three modes will be very complicated , but we then measure the number of photons contained in modes @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "if we measure the state @xmath22 , then the operation @xmath19 was successfully performed .",
    "the probability that we measure the desired result is @xmath23 .",
    "if some other number of photons is detected then the operation has failed , and the information contained in mode @xmath2 has been destroyed .",
    "one of the fundamental universal gates for quantum computation is the controlled sign flip , which shifts the phase of a two qubit state when both qubits have the logical value of @xmath3 but does nothing if one of the qubits is @xmath2 . in our loqc notation",
    ", this is the transformation @xmath24 .",
    "then we follow the procedure :    1 .",
    "apply the beam splitter @xmath25 to modes @xmath3 and @xmath26 .",
    "2 .   perform the @xmath19 operation on modes @xmath3 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "3 .   perform the @xmath19 operation on modes @xmath26 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "4 .   apply the beam splitter @xmath31 to modes @xmath3 and @xmath26 .",
    "measure the number of photons in modes @xmath27 through @xmath30 .",
    "if the state @xmath32 is detected , then the controlled phase shift has been performed correctly .",
    "if some other state is detected , then the qubits have been destroyed .",
    "this will succeed with probability @xmath33 , so we call this protocol for the controlled sign flip @xmath34 .",
    "soon we will discuss other protocols that will increase the success probability , but these are more easily understood in the context of quantum teleportation .",
    "the goal of quantum teleportation in a loqc is to transfer the photon state of one mode to some other mode without directly connecting the two through a beam splitter .",
    "the following procedure will transfer the state @xmath35 of mode @xmath2 to mode @xmath4 .    1 .",
    "prepare the state @xmath22 .",
    "apply the beam splitter @xmath25 to modes @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this creates the state @xmath36 .",
    "3 .   apply the beam splitter @xmath31 to modes @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "measure the number of photons in modes @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "if the measurement yields @xmath37 the mode @xmath4 will contain the state @xmath38 , so to return this to the original state @xmath39 , apply the phase shifter @xmath40 to mode @xmath4 .",
    "if the measurement yields @xmath41 mode @xmath4 will contain @xmath39 and nothing must be done .",
    "if the measurement has some other result , the operation has failed .",
    "this procedure will succeed with probability @xmath42 , but it can be increased with the following method :    1 .   prepare the state @xmath43 where @xmath44 @xmath45 times .",
    "@xmath46 requires @xmath47 optical modes , and they should be numbered from left to right in each term of the sum .",
    "@xmath46 can be prepared using only beam splitters and the state @xmath48 .",
    "operate on modes @xmath2 through @xmath0 with the beam splitter network @xmath49 , where the elements of the matrix describing @xmath49 are @xmath50 3 .",
    "measure the photons in modes @xmath2 through @xmath0 .",
    "if the number of photons detected is @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , then the teleportation procedure has succeeded .",
    "the original state occupying mode @xmath2 is found in mode @xmath53 , but this state may need to be corrected with a known phase shifter . the probability that @xmath52 is @xmath54 .    to improve the success of the controlled sign flip",
    ", we will perform the teleportation procedure on each qubit , but rather than use two copies of the state @xmath46 we will use the state @xmath55 knill , laflamme , and milburn give an algorithm for the preparation of this state in @xcite . according to their algorithm , the preparation of @xmath56 requires @xmath57 controlled phase shift operations @xcite each of which succeeds only probabilistically by performing the @xmath34 operation or by preparing @xmath58 for @xmath59 and executing this teleportation method .",
    "they provide no proof that their method is optimal , and we believe that finding the optimal procedure for preparation of @xmath56 is a fruitful open problem .",
    "imagine that qubit one occupies modes @xmath60 and @xmath61 , qubit two occupies modes @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and @xmath56 occupies modes @xmath3 through @xmath64 .",
    "the algorithm is :    1 .",
    "operate on modes @xmath60 and the first @xmath0 modes of @xmath56 with the beam splitter network @xmath49 .",
    "operate on modes @xmath62 and the third @xmath0 modes of @xmath56 with @xmath49 .",
    "measure modes @xmath60 and @xmath3 through @xmath0 . if @xmath65 photons are detected .",
    "the contents of mode @xmath60 are now found in mode @xmath66 .",
    "measure modes @xmath62 and @xmath67 through @xmath68 . if @xmath69 photons are detected , then the contents of mode @xmath62 are now found in mode @xmath70 .",
    "5 .   depending on @xmath71 and @xmath72 ,",
    "apply correcting phase shifters to @xmath66 and @xmath70 .",
    "provided that @xmath71 and @xmath72 satisfy the above conditions , this procedure will perform the controlled sign flip on the qubits rather than simply teleporting them .",
    "the probability that both teleportations succeed is @xmath73 , and we will refer to this procedure as @xmath74 . to increase",
    "this probability beyond 95% would require @xmath75 , and to prepare the necessary state @xmath76 involves @xmath77 uses of the controlled sign flip operation each of which succeeds probabilistically .",
    "in order to investigate the effects of imperfect photon detectors on the operation of the loqc , we have developed a computer simulation using mathematica .",
    "@xcite the simulation represents the state of the loqc in the fock basis in which a basis state assigns an integer number of photons to each optical mode .",
    "then superpositions are built out of the basis states in the usual manner .",
    "the simulation can then calculate how the operation of a collection of beam splitters and phase shifters transform the states . to simulate ideal measurement",
    "the simulation will generate a table displaying the probability to measure all possible numbers of photons in each mode being measured , the number of measured photons , and the collapsed state produced after the measurement . at this stage",
    "the simulation has calculated the probabilities that the measured modes of the computer contain 0 , 1 , 2 , ... , or @xmath78 photons , we must now calculate the probability that these photons are registered by the detectors .",
    "we model photon loss using a binomial distribution .",
    "@xcite if @xmath78 photons enter a detector , the probability that @xmath0 photons are registered by the detector is @xmath79 when @xmath80 , and @xmath81 when @xmath82 .",
    "the inefficiency of the detectors is described with the parameter @xmath83 which is the probability that any given photon will be missed by the detector .",
    "the photon detections may also be corrupted by noise photons . to calculate the probability that @xmath0 noise photons are added to the number of `` real '' photons each detector registers , we apply the poisson distribution .",
    "@xmath84 where @xmath85 is mean number of noise photons each detector is expected to register .",
    "note that this poisson distribution does not represent `` quantum noise '' in the photon field .",
    "instead , we imagine it to represent accidental , for example thermal , excitations inside the detector which are independent of the incoming photons",
    ".    the exact physics of the atom - photon interactions in a photon detector are very complicated , and we make no attempt to model them here .",
    "our goal is only to describe the interactions using the two phenomenological parameters @xmath83 and @xmath85 .",
    "it is difficult to imagine how a more detailed understanding of photon detector physics would yield wildly different probability distributions , so we are confident that our treatment will give a good understanding of the reliability of loqc",
    ".    we can apply these probability distributions to the photons entering each detector to build a table that shows the probability that each detector registers 1 , 2 , 3 , ... photons and the number of `` real '' photons that arrived at each detector . by adding the probabilities for the cases in which the number of photons registered by each detector and the number of photons that arrived at each detector are equal to one another and are both equal to the number prescribed by the loqc protocol we can calculate @xmath86 the probability that a given operation will succeed and the detectors will correctly detect the success . we also calculate @xmath87 , the probability that the detectors report that a given operation has succeeded , when in fact it may have failed , by adding the probabilities that the detectors register the number of photons prescribed by the loqc protocol without regard to the number of `` real '' photons that arrived at the detectors . using @xmath88 and @xmath89",
    ", we can also calculate @xmath90 the probability that the detectors register a false positive result , when the detectors register the number of photons prescribed by the loqc protocol but the number of photons that arrived at the detectors is not equal to the prescribed number .",
    "this is surely the most damaging sort of error , because it is disguised as a successful calculation .",
    "we first applied this analysis to the @xmath19 operation , which succeeds when one photon is detected in mode @xmath3 and zero photons are detected in mode @xmath4 .",
    "for an ideal device this should happen with probability @xmath91 .",
    "the results of our simulation appear in fig .",
    "[ ns ] , where we have plotted the @xmath86 and @xmath92 for the case when the input mode contains two photons .",
    "we have also applied a similar simulation to the conditional sign flip @xmath34 , when both entering qubits are in the logical @xmath93 state .",
    "plots showing the success probability and false success probability are shown in fig .",
    "[ cz116 ] .",
    "we find that for detectors with @xmath94 and @xmath95 , the operation will succeed in only 3.5% of its operations , and 35% of its apparent successes are in fact failures .",
    "the probability of obtaining false positive results will be below 1% for detectors better than those for which @xmath96 ; @xmath97 and @xmath98 ; or @xmath99 and @xmath100 .    the third system",
    "to which we apply our simulation is the controlled sign flip , @xmath101 , in which the state @xmath102 is prepared using a single operation of the @xmath34 gate .",
    "the two qubits , both in the logical @xmath93 state , are then teleported using the @xmath103 state .",
    "using perfect components , the probability of preparing @xmath103 is @xmath104 , and the probability of teleporting both qubits is @xmath23 . given detectors with @xmath105 we find that the probability to prepare @xmath103 is 0.035 , slightly more than half of the ideal probability , and 42% of the apparent successes are failures . using these detectors the probability to both prepare @xmath103 and to teleport the qubits is 0.0048 , only one third of the ideal success rate .",
    "false positive results can be expected in 58% of the attempts .",
    "false positive rates lower than 1% can be achieved with detectors better than @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath100 , or @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the less ambitious goal of lowering the false positive rate to 10% would be possible with detectors better than @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath100 , or @xmath97 and @xmath110 .",
    "these results are plotted in fig .",
    "because quantum teleportation is such an integral part of the improved versions of the controlled sign flip @xmath74 , we sought to understand the rate at which detector related errors grows as @xmath0 the size of the prepared teleportation state increases .",
    "provided that the state @xmath46 has been successfully prepared , we want to examine the probability that the state @xmath111 can be teleported when using detectors with inefficiency @xmath83 .",
    "for simplicity we assume that the detectors are noiseless .",
    "by examining several cases we have found a general formula for @xmath112 the probability that the teleportation succeeds and is correctly registered by the detectors : @xmath113 the probability that exactly @xmath114 or @xmath0 photons arrive at the detectors is @xmath115 , and the probability that all of the @xmath45 arriving photons are registered by the detectors is @xmath116 .",
    "according to this expression , for a given detector inefficiency @xmath83 , there is a critical @xmath117 for which @xmath88 is maximized , and increasing @xmath0 past @xmath118 will actually decrease the probability that the teleportation will succeed and be correctly registered by the detectors . in fig .",
    "[ teleport ] we plot the maximum achievable @xmath88 and the @xmath118 yielding this probability for a range of detector inefficiencies .",
    "of course , any increase in the number of detectors involved in the teleportation effort will increase the probability @xmath119 that the detectors report that the teleportation has succeeded , when it has not . to find @xmath119 we first calculate @xmath120 the probability that the detectors report that the teleportation was successful .",
    "this includes all of the events counted in @xmath112 and all of the ways that photons may be lost so that the detectors register @xmath121 or @xmath0 photons .",
    "@xmath119 is then given by @xmath123 any increase in @xmath0 will always increase the probability of receiving false positive results from the detectors . in fig .",
    "[ teleport]c we have plotted @xmath124 . to build a teleportation device with a success probability of 0.9 requires detectors with @xmath125 and @xmath126 , and for 0.99 success rate requires @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "[ teleport2 ] shows how quickly @xmath129 increases with @xmath0 for detector inefficiencies of 1% and 0.01% .",
    "construction of the near deterministic controlled sign flip requires the preparation of the state @xmath56 , which contains @xmath47 photons distributed throughout @xmath64 modes .",
    "the first @xmath47 modes are used to teleport the first qubit and the second @xmath47 modes to teleport the second qubit , and after the teleportation the qubits will have received a controlled sign flip . the probability that each of these teleportations succeeds is equal to @xmath112 , and the probability that detectors report that each teleportation succeeds is just @xmath120 .",
    "the probabilities of detecting the various possible numbers of photons during the teleportation of each qubit are independent of one another , so the probability to successfully implement the controlled sign is @xmath130 , and the probability of obtaining false positive results is @xmath131 for detectors with @xmath94 the maximum achievable success rate is 0.38 , which is obtained when @xmath132 , but 48% of apparent successes are false . to build a controlled sign teleportation that succeeds 90% of attempts requires detectors with loss @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "a 99% reliable gate needs @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "all of the results in this section rely on the assumption that the detectors produce zero noise .",
    "we chose to omit noise because of the complexity it adds to the calculations , because based on our simulations the errors caused by noise are very similar to those caused by loss when both the noise and loss are small , and because of the difficulty of displaying the results when varying inefficiency , @xmath0 , and noise .",
    "knill , laflamme , and milburn mention in @xcite that one possible way to reduce the occurrence of false positive results in the teleportation procedure is to , after measuring @xmath137 photons in modes @xmath2 through @xmath0 , also measure the photons in modes @xmath138 through @xmath139 and modes @xmath140 through @xmath47 ( all of the ancillary modes that do not contain the teleported qubit ) .",
    "then the total number of detected photons should equal the number of photons in @xmath46 , otherwise one or more has been lost .",
    "although this would reduce false positive results it will also reduce the device s success probability because sometimes the @xmath141 detectors in the second stage will lose photons when the @xmath138 primary detectors monitoring modes @xmath2 through @xmath0 function correctly , in which case good events would be discarded . if we naively imagine that each detector has the same probability @xmath142 to lose at least one photon , then using this method would reduce the success rate of the teleportation from @xmath143 to @xmath144 .",
    "from all successful teleportations , a fraction of @xmath145 would be rejected because some of the secondary detectors may malfunction .",
    "in @xcite knill , laflamme , and milburn conservatively estimate that an accuracy threshold better than 99% for controlled sign flip operations is required to construct a reliable loqc . the main result of this paper is the calculation that to achieve this threshold when performing the @xmath74 with a perfectly prepared @xmath56 state requires photon detectors with inefficiencies lower than @xmath146 , which are much superior to today s best photon detectors .",
    "this leads us to search for loqc schemes that do not rely so heavily on the detection of single photons .",
    "one such possibility may be the use of coherent state qubits as outlined in @xcite . in their scheme",
    "all detectors except one receive a large number of photons , and success or failure decisions are based on identifying the detector that registered zero photons compared to those detectors that registered a number of photons proportional to the ( assumed to be large ) amplitude of the coherent state .",
    "this work has made no attempt to analyze the effect of unreliable photon sources and beam splitters , which would greatly complicate the analysis .",
    "another open problem is the analysis of the many error correction procedures outlined in @xcite , to understand their vulnerability to photon loss and noise .",
    "lastly , we should note that this work should not be interpreted as a criticism of the many current experimental efforts @xcite to build some basic loqc elements .",
    "most of these experiments apparently plan to use coincidence measurements , which are largely impervious to corruption by photon loss or noise because those events can be discarded .",
    "however this is not a practical strategy to incorporate in a large scale quantum computer , because the qubits can not be measured until the entire calculation involving very large numbers of controlled sign flip operations is complete .",
