    "rare @xmath3 meson decays , induced by flavor  changing neutral current ( fcnc ) @xmath4 transitions , is one of the most promising research area in particle physics .",
    "theoretical interest to the @xmath3 meson decays lies in their role as a potential precision testing ground for the standard model ( sm ) at loop level .",
    "experimentally , these decays will provide quantitative information about the cabibbo  kobayashi ",
    "maskawa ( ckm ) elements @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "besides these rare decay have the potential for establishing new physics beyond sm , such as two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) @xcite .",
    "firstly the most reliable quantitative test of fcnc processes in @xmath3 decays is expected to be measured in inclusive channels .",
    "in particular , the decays @xmath7 are important probes of the effective hamiltonian governing the fcnc transition @xmath8 . the hope that @xmath9 decay will be measurable in experiments in the near future , encourage extensive investigation of this process in the sm , 2hdm and mssm @xcite@xcite .",
    "the matrix element of the @xmath10 contains terms describing the virtual effects induced by @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 loops which are proportional to @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively . using unitarity of the ckm matrix and neglecting @xmath16 in comparison to @xmath14 and @xmath15 ,",
    "it is obvious that the matrix element for the @xmath10 involves only one independent ckm factor @xmath14 so that cp  violation in this channel is strongly suppressed in the sm .",
    "the situation is totally different for the @xmath17 decay , since all three ckm factors @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , are all of the same order ( in sm ) and therefore can induce considerable cp  violating difference between the decay rates of the reactions @xmath17 and @xmath21 .",
    "it should be noted here that in presence of a much stronger decay @xmath10 , the detection of the @xmath17 decay seems to be more problematic .",
    "for this reason , in search of cp violation the corresponding exclusive decay channels @xmath0 and @xmath22 are more preferable . in general , the inclusive decays are rather difficult to measure in comparison to the exclusive ones .",
    "cp  violating effects in inclusive @xmath17 and exclusive @xmath0 , @xmath22 channels were studied within the framework of the sm in @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to derive quantitative predictions for the cp violation in the exclusive @xmath0 and @xmath22 decays , in context of the general two higgs doublet model , in which a new source for cp violation is present ( see below ) .",
    "2hdm model is one of the simplest extension of the sm , which contains two complex higgs doublets , while the sm contains only one . in general , in 2hdm the flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) that appear at tree level , are avoided by imposing an _ ad hoc _ discrete symmetry @xcite .",
    "one possible approach to avoid these unwanted fcnc at tree level is to couple all fermions to only one of the above  mentioned higgs doublets ( model i ) .",
    "the other possibility is the coupling of the up and down quarks to the first and second higgs doublets , with the vacuum expectation values @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively ( model ii ) .",
    "model ii is more attractive since its higgs sector coincides with the ones in the supersymmetric model . in this model there",
    "exist five physical higgs fields : neutral scalars @xmath25 , @xmath26 , neutral pseudoscalar @xmath27 and charged higgs bosons @xmath28 .",
    "the interaction vertex of fermions with higgs fields depends on @xmath29 , which is the free parameter of the model .",
    "the new experimental results of cleo and aleph collaborations @xcite on the branching ratio @xmath30 decay impose strict restrictions on the charged higgs boson mass and @xmath31 .",
    "recently , the lower bound on these parameters were determined from the analysis of the @xmath30 decay , including nlo qcd corrections @xcite .",
    "other indirect bound on the ratio @xmath32 come from @xmath33 decay , where @xmath34 @xcite , and from the @xmath35 lepton decays @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the consequence of an analysis without discrete symmetry has been investigated in a more general model in 2hdm , namely , model iii @xcite . in this model fcnc",
    "appears naturally at tree level .",
    "however , the fcnc s involving the first two generations are highly suppressed , as is observed in the low energy experiments , and those involving the the third generation is not as severely suppressed as the first two generations , which are restricted by the existing experimental results .    in this work",
    "we assume that all tree level fcnc couplings are negligible .",
    "it should be noted however that , even with this assumption , the couplings of fermions to higgs bosons may have a complex phase @xmath37 .",
    "in other words , in this model there exists a new source of cp violation that is absent in the sm , model i and model ii .",
    "the effects of such an extra phase in the @xmath30 decay were discussed in @xcite .",
    "the constraints on the phase angle @xmath38 in the product @xmath39 of higgs  fermion coupling ( see below ) imposed by the neutron electric dipole moment , @xmath40 mixing .",
    "@xmath41 parameter and @xmath42 is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we present the necessary theoretical framework . the branching ratios , cp  violating effects in the partial widths and forward  backward asymmetry for the above  mentioned exclusive decay channels are studied in section 3 .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the numerical analysis and concluding remarks .",
    "before presenting the necessary theoretical background , let us go through the main essential points of the general higgs doublet model ( model iii ) . in this model , both higgs doublets can couple to up and down quarks . without loss of generality we can work in a basis such that the first doublet generates all the fermion and gauge boson masses , whose vacuum expectation values are = (    c 0 +   +    )  ,   . in this basis",
    "the first doublet @xmath43 is the same as in the sm , and all new higgs bosons result from the second doublet @xmath44 , which can be written in the following form _ 1 = (    c g^+ +   + v + _ 1 ^ 0 +",
    "i g^0    )  ,   _ 2 = (    c h^+ +   + _ 2 ^ 0 + i a^0    )  , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the goldstone bosons . the neutral @xmath47 and @xmath48",
    "are not the physical mass eigenstate , but their linear combinations give the neutral @xmath25 and @xmath26 higgs bosons : _",
    "1 ^ 0 = h^0 cos - h^0 sin  , + _ 2 ^ 0 = h^0 sin + h^0 cos  .",
    "the general yukawa lagrangian can be written as _",

    "_ 1 d_jr + _",
    "ij^u |q_il _ 2 u_jr + _",
    "ij^d |q_il _ 2 d_jr + h.c .  , where @xmath49 , @xmath50 are the generation indices , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , in general , are the non  diagonal coupling matrices , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the left and right  handed projection operators . in eq .",
    "( 1 ) all states are weak states , that can be transformed to the mass eigenstates by rotation . after performing this rotation on the yukawa lagrangian",
    ", we get _ y = - h^+ |u  , where @xmath56 represents the mass eigenstates of @xmath57 quarks . in the present analysis",
    ", we will use a simple ansatz for @xmath58 @xcite , ^u^+,d = _ ij  .",
    "also it assumed that @xmath59 is complex , i.e. , @xmath60 , and for simplicity we choose @xmath61 to be diagonal to suppress all tree level fcnc couplings , and as a result @xmath59 are also diagonal but remain complex .",
    "note that the results for model i and model ii can be obtained from model iii by the following substitutions : & & _ tt = cot   _ bb = - cot  , + & & _ tt = cot   _ bb = + tan  , and @xmath62 .",
    "after this brief introduction about the general higgs doublet model , let us return our attention to the @xmath17 decay . the powerful framework into which the perturbative qcd corrections to the physical decay amplitude incorporated in a systematic way , is the effective hamiltonian method . in this approach ,",
    "the heavy degrees of freedom in the present case , i.e. , @xmath63 quark , @xmath64 are integrated out .",
    "the procedure is to match the full theory with the effective theory at high scale @xmath65 , and then calculate the wilson coefficients at lower @xmath66 using the renormalization group equations . in our calculations",
    "we choose the higher scale as @xmath65 , since the charged higgs boson is heavy enough ( @xmath67 see @xcite ) to neglect the evolution from @xmath68 to @xmath69 .    in the version of the 2hdm we consider in this work , the charged higgs boson exchange diagrams do not produce new operators and the operator basis is the same as the one used for the @xmath17 decay in the sm . for this reason in the model under consideration , the charged higgs boson contributions to leading order change only the value of the wilson coefficients at @xmath69 scale , i.e. , c_7 ^ 2hdm(m_w ) & = & c_7^sm(m_w ) + c_7^h^(m_w ) + c_9 ^ 2hdm(m_w ) & = & c_9^sm(m_w ) + c_9^h^(m_w ) + c_10 ^ 2hdm(m_w ) & = & c_10^sm(m_w ) + c_10^h^(m_w )  .",

    "it follows from eqs .",
    "( 57 ) that among all the wilson coefficients , only @xmath72 involves the new phase angle @xmath38 .",
    "we have neglected the neutral higgs boson exchange diagram contributions , since higgs boson ",
    "fermion interaction is proportional to the lepton mass .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for the @xmath17 decay is [ 2932 ] = -4 v_tb v^*_td \\{_i=0 ^ 10 c_i ( ) o_i ( ) + _ u _",
    "i=1 ^ 2 c_i ( ) }  , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the wilson coefficients .",
    "the explicit form of all operators @xmath75 can be found in [ 2932 ] .",
    "the evolution of the wilson coefficients from the higher scale @xmath65 down to the low energy scale @xmath76 is described by the renormalization group equation c_i^eff ( ) = c_i^eff ( ) _ ^eff ( )  , where @xmath77 is the anomalous dimension matrix .",
    "the coefficient @xmath78 at the scale @xmath79 in nlo is calculated in @xcite : c_7^eff(m_b ) = c_7 ^ 0(m_b ) + c_7 ^ 1,eff(m_b )  , where @xmath80 is the leading order ( lo ) term and @xmath81 describes the nlo terms , whose explicit forms can be found in @xcite . in our case",
    ", the expressions for these coefficients can be obtained from the results of @xcite by making the following replacements : y ^2 _ tt ^2    x y^ * _ tt _ bb e^i  . in the sm ,",
    "the qcd corrected wilson coefficient @xmath82 , which enters to the decay amplitude up to the next leading order has been calculated in [ 2932 ] .",
    "the wilson coefficient @xmath83 does not receive any new corrections at all , i.e. , @xmath84 .",
    "as we have already noted , in the version of the 2hdm we consider in this work , there does not appear any new operator other than those that exist in the sm , therefore it is enough to make the replacement @xmath85 in [ 2932 ] , in order to calculate @xmath86 at @xmath87 scale .",
    "hence , including the nlo qcd corrections , @xmath82 can be written as : + & & + g(m_c , s ) + & & + _ u ( 3 c_1 ( ) + c_2 ( ) ) - g(0,s ) c_3 ( ) + 3 c_4 ( ) + & & - g 1 , s4 c_3 + 4 c_4 + 3 c_5 + c_6 - g 0 , sc_3 + 3 c_4 + & & + 3 c_3 + c_4 + 3 c_5 + c_6  , where @xmath88 , and + & & - n 1 -s - n s +   represents the @xmath89 correction from the one gluon exchange in the matrix element of @xmath90 , while the function @xmath91 arises from one loop contributions of the four  quark operators @xmath92@xmath93 , whose form is + & & + \\ { 1 - y_i ( n - i ) + y_i -1 2 arctan }  , where @xmath94 .",
