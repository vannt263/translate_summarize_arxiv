    "the aim of the measurements , performed by the na49 experiment during the energy scan program at the cern sps , was to investigate the properties of strongly interacting matter in heavy - ion collisions via a vast range of observables from light hadrons ( @xmath4 , k ) to light nuclear clusters ( @xmath0he , @xmath1 ) .",
    "data on composite particle production in reactions with heavy ions gives us valuable information about the late stage of the fireball evolution and may provide a measure of the size of the particle emitting source .",
    "in addition , a comparison of experimental data on cluster yields to the statistical model expectations can also shed some light on the mechanism of formation of light nuclei in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the main components of the na49 apparatus @xcite are four time projection chambers ( tpcs ) ( two of them are placed within magnetic fields produced by the superconducting magnets ) for tracking and particle identification ( pid ) via ionization energy loss de / dx measurements . the time - of - flight system ( two tof scintillator arrays situated beyond the tpcs ) provides timing information for pid covering the mid - rapidity region . the downstream zero degree calorimeter was used for triggering and centrality determination .",
    "this report is based on the analysis of the data collected during the 1999 - 2002 running period .",
    "a total of @xmath5 events representing the 7% most central pb+pb collisions at 20a , 30a , 40a and 80a gev were used in the study of @xmath0he and @xmath1 production .",
    "anti - deuterons are measured in the 23% most central pb+pb collisions at 158a gev ( @xmath6 events ) . combined",
    "de / dx and tof information was used for the identification of single charged hadrons and ( anti)clusters at mid - rapidity .",
    "double charged @xmath0he clusters are identified over almost the entire phase space via the de / dx method .",
    "the results presented below include corrections for the pid track quality cuts , background contamination , detection efficiency and geometrical acceptance .",
    "the detailed description of the analysis procedure is given in refs .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] ( left panel ) shows the mid - rapidity transverse mass spectra for helium-3 and tritons observed in central pb+pb collisions at 20a-80a gev .",
    "as expected , the collective transverse flow flattens m@xmath7-spectra for clusters at low m@xmath7 , so that the distributions shown are fitted with a double exponential function ( fits are shown as dashed lines in fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the mean transverse mass values as obtained from the fits at 20a and 80a gev are plotted in fig.[fig1 ] ( right panel , upper plot ) together with the na49 measurements for hadrons ( @xmath4 , k , @xmath8 ) and deuterons @xcite . here",

    "_ argued @xcite , a linear dependence of mean @xmath9@xmath10@xmath11 on the particle mass futhermore supports the conclusion that the particle emitting source has a uniform ( box - like ) density distribution and a linear velocity profile .",
    "there is no significant difference in resulting values of @xmath9@xmath10@xmath11 for particle species between 20a and 80a gev data .",

    "however the yield of @xmath13 ( usually ) remains unmeasured .",
    "as it has been established in the rqmd model , the initial ratio of neutrons participating in the collision to protons ( @xmath13:@xmath8=1.54:1 for @xmath14pb ) changes considerably toward the equilibrium value of @xmath13/@xmath8=1 during the fireball evolution as a result of strong resonance production .",
    "assuming a simple additive scheme which relates the yield of the cluster to the product of the yields of nucleons , the freezeout @xmath13/@xmath8 ratio may be deduced from the @xmath1/@xmath0he ratio .",
