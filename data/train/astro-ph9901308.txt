    "iras  201812244 and iras  132243809 are part of the boller et al .",
    "( 1992 ) sample of bright iras galaxies which were also identified as soft x - ray sources by rosat .",
    "elizalde & steiner ( 1994 ) reported that iras  201812244 has a seyfert 2 type spectrum and an absolute magnitude bright enough to be called a qso , and suggested that it qualifies as one of the elusive type 2 ( narrow - line ) qsos .",
    "previous studies have shown that some type 2 active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , with narrow permitted and forbidden emission lines , have obscured broad - line regions ( blr ) that are visible only in reflected and scattered  and thus polarized  light .",
    "thus the polarized flux of these obscured type  2 objects have broad balmer lines , i.e. , they look like the total flux of a type  1 object with broad permitted and narrow forbidden lines .",
    "this has been seen for about 12 ` classical ' seyfert  2 galaxies , some narrow - line radio galaxies , and about half a dozen narrow - line ultraluminous iras galaxies with luminosities comparable to those of qsos .",
    "( e.g. antonucci & miller 1985 ; miller & goodrich 1990 ; kay et al .",
    "1992 ; tran et al . 1995 ; young et al . 1996",
    "; heisler et al .",
    "1997 ; kay &  moran 1998 ) . in qsos , the agn with the highest luminosities , only the type 1 broad  line objects normally are seen .",
    "if qsos are to fit into these ` unified models ' of agn , we should be observing some of them too at an orientation in which the blr is obscured , so that they appear as very luminous objects with only narrow emission lines in their spectra .",
    "there have been numerous transitory claims of observations of such type  2 qsos , especially in x - ray identified targets , usually because their optical spectra were of low signal - to - noise or because they did nt include the h@xmath0  spectral region . indeed , in their optical survey of the northern boller et al .",
    "( 1992 ) sample , moran , halpern , &  helfand ( 1996 ) reclassified iras  201812244 as a ` narrow - line seyfert  1 ( nls1 ) ' .",
    "these seyfert galaxies were first identified by phillips ( 1976 ) and osterbrock & pogge ( 1985 ) , and are sometimes called i  zw  1 objects after their prototype .",
    "these objects have narrow forbidden and permitted lines , high ionization lines as in classical seyfert 2s , strong permitted narrow emission line complexes , and usually an [ ] @xmath15007 to h@xmath2 flux ratio @xmath3 .",
    "a comprehensive analysis of their 1994 optical spectra of iras  201812244 confirmed their initial reclassification ( halpern & moran 1998 ) .",
    "nls1 often are highly represented in soft x - ray selected samples ( stephens 1987 ; moran et al .",
    "1996 ) and thus this classification is not surprising .",
    "we observed iras  201812244 ( z=0.185 ) in order to look for a possible obscured blr , as indicated by broad h@xmath0 and h@xmath2 emission lines in polarized flux and to see how its polarization properties compared with other similar targets .",
    "we present spectropolarimetry of this agn , taken at the ctio 4 m with a visitor polarimetry unit on the rc spectrograph , and imaging polarimetry from the laboratrio nacional de astrofsca ( lna ) 1.6 m telescope in braspolis .",
    "another narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy , iras 132243809 ( z=0.067 ) , was also observed with spectropolarimetry .",
    "these observations took place during the first test run of the ctio spectropolarimeter on may 23 , 1995 .",
    "we used the rc spectrograph at the ctio 4 m telescope , with a loral 3k ccd , a kpgl3 grating with a dispersion of 1.2  / pixel , a spectral resolution of 4 , and a wavelength range of 4445 - 8150 .",
    "additional optics were placed into the spectrograph in order to conduct the polarimetry observations . a rotatable superachromatic half waveplate ( frecker & serkowski 1974 ) with 19 mm clear aperture ( manufactured by halle in germany ) was installed 63 mm above the slit .",
    "the waveplate was rotated in @xmath4 steps with an external controller built at the university of wisconsin .",
    "miller , robinson , & goodrich ( 1988 ) discuss the advantages of a dual - beam instrument for spectropolarimetry . for a beamsplitting device we used a 44 mm diameter square double calcite block ( savart plate , built at optoeletrnica , so paulo ) , mounted 78 mm below the slit .",
    "each component prism was cut with its optical axis at @xmath5 to their faces and they were cemented with their optical axis crossed .",
    "this arrangement minimizes the astigmatism and color which are present when a single calcite block is used ( serkowski 1974 ) .",
    "this beamsplitter produces two spectra of the given object , separated by 1 mm and with orthogonal polarizations .",
    "a comb dekker used for observations had a series of parallel slots each about 1 mm wide .",
    "this system is more similar to the spectropolarimeter on the isis spectrograph at the wht ( tinbergen & rutten 1992 ) than to the instruments recently constructed in the u.s .",
    "( e.g. goodrich 1991 ) .",
    "an advantage of using a savart plate is that the focus of the two beams is consistent , a disadvantage is that the length of the slit with the comb dekker is short .",
    "we tested the instrumental polarization by observing the published null standard stars hd  100623 and hd  98161 at all 16 positions of the waveplate . even though images at only 4 consecutive positions of the waveplate ( e.g.  @xmath6 through @xmath7 ) are needed for a polarization measurement , observations at all available positions",
    "allows the overall performance of the polarimeter , in particular the residuals at each position angle , to be inspected .",
    "the linear polarization @xmath8 measured for these objects was 0.03% or less .",
    "polarization standard stars hd  298383 , hd  187929 , hd  110984 , and hd  155197 were also observed , and found to agree with published v band values ( turnshek et al . 1990 ) .",
    "the polarizance ( the instrumental response to 100% polarized light ) was found to be 98% .",
    "the zero point of the position angle correction curve , which depends on the position of the fast axis of the waveplate and the orientation of the beamsplitter , was obtained by comparing the measured polarization position angles of the standard stars with the published values .",
    "spectropolarimetry data reduction and analysis were performed with the _ vista _ software package originally developed at lick observatory , and additional routines .",
    "iras  201812244 was observed for 15 minutes in each of 8 waveplate positions , ( @xmath6 through @xmath7 and @xmath9 through @xmath10 ) for a total of 16 spectra in two hours .",
    "iras  132243809 was observed for 15 minutes in each of 4 waveplate positions for a total of 8 spectra in 1 hour .",
    "data were reduced following miller et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , and all summing and averaging was done with the stokes parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the averaged @xmath11 and @xmath12 stokes parameter spectra were used to create the the observed polarizations presented in table 1 .",
    "iras  201812244 was observed with a ccd imaging polarimeter ( magalhes et al .",
    "1996 ) at the 1.6 m telescope at the lna on september  1 , 1994 .",
    "this data is important to serve as a check on the spectropolarimetry measurements with a new system and to provide field stars for estimating the galactic foreground polarization .",
    "the polarimeter is a modification of the observatory s direct ccd camera to allow for high precision imaging polarimetry .",
    "the first element in the beam is a rotatable , achromatic half  wave retarder followed by a savart plate from the instituto astronomico e geofisico , usp .",
    "this savart plate was built similarly to the one used at ctio .",
    "this gives us two images of each object in the field , separated by 1 mm ( corresponding to about 13  at the telescope focal plane ) and with orthogonal polarizations .",
    "one polarization modulation cycle is covered for every @xmath13 rotation of the waveplate .",
    "the simultaneous observations of the two beams allows observing under non - photometric conditions at the same time that the sky polarization is practically cancelled ( magalhes et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "ccd exposures were taken through the v filter with the waveplate rotated through 12 positions @xmath4 apart .",
    "the exposure time at each position was 900s .",
    "after bias and flatfield corrections , photometry was performed on the images of objects in the field with iraf , and then a special purpose fortran routine processed these data files and calculated the normalized linear polarization from a least squares solution .",
    "this yields the stokes parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 as well as the theoretical ( i.e. , photon noise ) and measurement errors .",
    "the latter are obtained from the residuals of the observations at each waveplate position angle ( @xmath14 ) with regards to the expected cos @xmath15 curve and are quoted in table 2 ; they are consistent with the photon noise errors ( magalhes et al . 1984 ) .",
    "the instrumental @xmath11 and @xmath12 values were converted to the equatorial system from standard star data obtained in the same night .",
    "the instrumental polarization was measured to be less than 0.03% .",
    "figure 1 shows the field and identifies the objects .",
    "the separation between each pair of images is 1 mm , or 12.9at the 1.6 m f/10 lna telescope .",
    "the size of the field shown in the image is 3.7 @xmath16 5.6. as noted in moran et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and shown in fig . 1 of halpern & moran ( 1998 ) , iras  201812244 ( obj .",

    "1 ) is the extended object in the center of the field ; obj .",
    "2 is the one incorrectly identified instead in fig . 1 of elizalde & steiner ( 1994 ) .",
    "the imaging polarimetry includes data on targets angularly close to the object of interest , thereby providing the means to estimate the interstellar polarization towards a given direction .",
    "table 2 includes the polarization data for iras  201812244 and for six other objects in the field . for each target ,",
    "the table gives the percent polarization , its error and the equatorial position angle .",
    "the polarization values in table 2 have not been corrected for statistical bias . iras",
    "201812244 is more polarized than the other objects in the field , at @xmath17% and position angle @xmath18 .",
    "the six field objects included in table 2 were the ones that showed a ( de - biased ) polarization larger than 3 sigma . a weighted average , performed on the stokes parameters of the field objects , yields a polarization of @xmath19% at @xmath20 .",
    "the error of this estimate is entirely consistent with the average value of the individual measurement errors in table 2 divided by sqrt(6 ) ( 0.062% ) as well as with the variance obtained from the spread of the individual q and u values .",
    "we therefore take the average polarization value above as the galactic foreground polarization towards iras  201812244 .",
    "these values were used to correct the spectropolarimetry stokes parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "figure 2 shows part of our de - redshifted flux spectrum of iras  201812244 .",
    "measurements and analysis of the balmer and forbidden lines were recently presented in halpern & moran ( 1998 ) .",
    "we note that our higher s / n spectrum indicates broader wings on the balmer lines than were seen in the spectrum of elizalde & steiner ( 1994 ) , and the emission line complexes discussed in halpern & moran ( 1998 ) are seen at 45004680  and 51055395 .",
    "thus we concur with the classification of this object by the latter as a narrow - line seyfert 1 .",
    "figure 3 shows our spectropolarimetric observations of iras  201812244 .",
    "the panels indicate the direct flux spectrum , the polarization ( strictly the rotated stokes parameter @xmath21 , obtained from rotating the stokes @xmath22 by the average position angle @xmath23 : @xmath24 ) , the position angle of polarization , and the corresponding polarized flux ( stokes flux @xmath25flux ) .",
    "the polarization spectrum uncorrected for galactic interstellar polarization shows an average @xmath8 for @xmath26  of about @xmath27 , at a position angle of @xmath28 , in excellent agreement with the imaging polarimetry measurement .",
    "when corrected for the galactic interstellar polarization value in table  2 , we find @xmath8 of about @xmath29 at @xmath30",
    ". the interstellar correction did not alter the original spectral shapes of the data in figure 3 .",
    "we have not corrected for starlight dilution of the polarization because we see no stellar absorption lines in the spectrum .",
    "@xmath8 is generally constant with wavelength , and does not show the rise to the blue indicative of dust reflection as seen in the polarized narrow - line seyfert 1s of goodrich ( 1989 ) .",
    "@xmath8 may drop lower to near zero at the positions of the forbidden lines of [ ] suggesting these lines come from a spatially different nuclear region than h@xmath0 and h@xmath2 .",
    "the position angle of polarization is constant , except for a rotation across the [ ] lines , indicating perhaps a separate source of polarization ( e.g.  transmission through dust grains in the host galaxy ) .",
    "iras  20181 is detected as an unresolved 25 mjy source in the 20 cm nvss survey ( condon et al .",
    "a higher resolution radio observation of iras  201812244 with a good radio position angle is not yet available , thus we can not compare radio and polarization position angles to see if they are perpendicular as in most seyfert  2s ( antonucci 1983 , brindle et al .",
    "1990 ) , some nls1s ( ulvestad et al . 1995 ) and some seyfert 1s ( goodrich & miller 1994 ) , or parallel as in most seyfert  1s ( antonucci 1983 , martel 1996 ) .",
    "this comparison would be interesting as there is considerable discussion as to whether nls1s as a class are objects in which we are viewing the disk pole - on ( e. g. osterbrock & pogge 1985 , puchnarewicz et al .",
    "1992 , ulvestad et al .",
    "the relatively high @xmath8 value we obtained would argue against this although it may be produced by scatterers symmetrically distributed around the central source .    in the plot of the polarized flux , which shows the spectrum of the polarized light from the object , h@xmath2 and h@xmath0 are visible , but the data is too noisy to measure an h@xmath0/h@xmath2 ratio accurately .",
    "the slope of the continua in the direct and polarized flux spectra are both nearly flat .",
    "figure 4 shows the h@xmath2 line profile in flux ( dark line ) and polarized flux .",
    "the fwhm of h@xmath2 in both direct and polarized flux is about 600 km / sec .",
    "direct flux and polarized flux h@xmath0 also have a similar fwhm .",
    "the lines are not shifted in the polarized flux with respect to the direct flux .",
    "thus the balmer lines do not appear to be significantly broader in the polarized flux as we might expect if an obscured blr was present and visible only in dust scattered or electron scattered - and thus polarized - light .",
    "the optical spectrum of the nls1 iras  132243809 is discussed in boller et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , who present line measurements , including the strong lines , and an h@xmath0  to h@xmath2  ratio of 7.6 .",

    "the panels indicate the direct flux spectrum , and the @xmath11 and @xmath12 stokes parameters .",
    "the averaged @xmath8 is @xmath310.38% at position angle @xmath32 .",
    "we do not have imaging polarimetry of the field around iras  132243809 , but given that it has a galactic latitude of @xmath33 , it would seem likely that some of this is attributable to galactic interstellar polarization .",
    "mathewson & ford ( 1970 ) include measurements of four stars ( hd 114981 , hd 116413 , hd 117440 , and hd 117597 ) , which are within @xmath34 of iras  132243809 in the sky .",
    "the polarizations and position angles of the polarization vary from 0.14 - 0.20% at 20.3- 67.0 , with the closest of these , hd 117597 , 1.66away in the sky , having the highest values .",
    "these stars are not all that close to the target , but it suggests that perhaps at least 0.2% of the measured polarization originates in the galaxy .",
    "the galactic e(b - v ) has been estimated from the distributed iras maps of schlegal et al .",
    "( 1998 ) as 0.12 mag .",
    "a similar estimate comes from using the stark et al .",
    "( 1992 ) neutral hydrogen column density @xmath35 @xmath36 .",
    "using @xmath37  e(b - v ) ( serkowski , mathewson , & ford 1975 ) , this suggests a maximum polarization from our galaxy of 1.08% .",
    "however the high h@xmath0  to h@xmath2  ratio in iras  132243809 could indicate reddening and a possible dust transmission polarization component within the host galaxy .",
    "many seyfert 1 galaxies have a continuum polarization rising to the blue ( e.g. goodrich & miller 1994 ; martel 1996 ) .",
    "dust scattering is the most commonly suggested mechanism for this polarization , as the scattering cross section of small dust grains increases slowly towards shorter wavelengths . with the addition of redder nuclear light ,",
    "the observed increase in polarization towards the blue steepens .",
    "the polarization of the nls1 galaxies discussed in goodrich ( 1989 ) , as well as mrk 486 ( smith et al .",
    "1997 ) and iras 17020 + 4544 ( leighly et al . 1997 ) are attributed to dust scattering .    in general , polarized synchrotron radiation is insufficient to explain the observations because at least some of the lines are observed to be polarized .",
    "polarization from dust transmission in our galaxy or the host galaxy is nearly constant over 4000 - 7000 , but with a peak that corresponds to the grain size and a decrease toward smaller and larger wavelengths .",
    "the polarized flux would appear reddened ( goodrich 1989 ) .",
    "electron scattering will preserve the shape of the scattered spectrum , except possibly for a broadening of the balmer lines in the polarized flux ( unless the electrons are cool ; even a relatively low electron temperature of 5000  k would broaden the line by 900 km sec@xmath38 , which would be noticeable in figure 4 ) .",
    "however electron scattering combined with an unpolarized reddened nuclear light or redder starlight can also yield a continuum polarization which rises to the blue .",
    "for example , wills et al .",
    "( 1992 ) observed iras  13349 + 2438 , a luminous qso with properties similar to a nls1 , and concluded that the wavelength dependence of its high polarization which rises to the blue is attributable to electron scattering , as well as to a dilution of the polarization by direct , unpolarized light from the reddened continuum .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 1997 ) observed i  zw  1 with ground - based and @xmath39 spectropolarimetry , and found that the optical polarization was low but possibly time variable .",
    "they concluded that the wavelength dependence of the polarization of i  zw  1 is largely due to starlight from the host galaxy . when a correction was made for this ,",
    "the continuum polarization became almost independent of wavelength from the uv to the red , and thus is likely due to scattering by electrons .",
    "this example indicates that unpolarized starlight can affect the polarization measurements even in a nls1 , and that it is possible that the polarization may change in some of these objects .    in our data of iras  201812244 ,",
    "the continuum polarization is nearly constant with wavelength ( although the data do not go as far to the blue as in the objects discussed above ) . as noted by goodrich ( 1989 ) , it is difficult to estimate the starlight contribution to the direct flux spectrum because the emission lines contaminate the mg i @xmath40 and g band stellar features .",
    "( smith et al .",
    "1997 derived a host galaxy spectrum for i  zw  1 using the total @xmath41 magnitude of the host galaxy to estimate a galaxy fraction of 0.5 at 5500 , an unusually high starlight correction for a high luminosity seyfert  1 ) .",
    "we do not make a correction for starlight in the spectrum of iras  201812244 , and thus find that it may have a similar continuum polarization to i  zw  1 , due to electron scattering with a possible dust transmission component .",
    "dust scattering seems less likely because the reddened continuum would steepen the rise towards the blue .",
    "the polarization of iras  132243809 measured in our single set of observations is low enough to be consistent with a galactic interstellar origin",
    ". low polarization of nls1s is not unusual ; goodrich ( 1989 ) found 11/17 of his nls1s to be polarized at a level consistent with interstellar polarization from our galaxy .",
    "grupe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) observed a sample of 43 bright soft x - ray selected ( _ rosat _ ) agn , half of which were nls1s , and found that only two nls1 were polarized ( iras  13349 + 2438 again and iras  f12397 + 3333 ) . another x - ray nls1 galaxy with a similar spectrum to iras  132243809 which was found to be unpolarized ( i.e. , less than 0.4% ) is re  j1034 + 396 ( puchnarewicz et al . 1995 , breeveld & puchnarewicz 1998 ) .",
    "the authors suggest this could be due to geometrical effects ( symmetric distribution of scatterers so that the polarization vectors cancel out , e. g. as in a pole on view ) , dilution of the polarization as proposed for iras 13349 + 2438 ( wills et al .",
    "1992 ) , or the absence of aligned dust grains in the line of sight",
    ". however , boller et al . (",
    "1997 ) propose that an edge - on model , with a highly inclined inner accretion disk , can explain the strong x - ray variability and the soft x - ray excess of iras  132243809 .      in the other polarized nls1s ( e.g.  goodrich 1989 , leighly et al .",
    "1997 ) it is also generally found that the narrow forbidden lines are less polarized than the balmer lines , which can have a different polarization than the continuum .",
    "this suggests that the scattering material responsible for the observed polarization is between the nlr and the blr .",
    "the position angle does not vary across the balmer lines , thus the scatterers are not likely within the blr itself .",
    "recently leighly et al .",
    "( 1997 ) investigated the connection between optical polarization and the presence of warm absorber features in the x - ray spectra of a sample of seyfert  1 galaxies .",
    "they showed that objects with optical polarizations greater than 1% are likely to have warm absorbers , and suggested this indicates a link between the warm absorber , reddened spectrum , and polarization .",
    "for example , the polarized nls1 iras  17024 + 4544 contains a warm absorber as seen in the _ asca _ data ( leighly et al .",

    "re - analysis shows that there is marginal evidence for a warm absorber ( at the 95% confidence level ; leighly 1998 ) .",
    "if the polarization indeed occurs inside the nlr , this suggests that the absorbing material is within that region as well , perhaps in the molecular torus as has been suggested for seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "if this obscuration is inside the agn , then it would affect h@xmath2  but not [ ] , which can explain why the [ ] @xmath15007/h@xmath2 ratio of 3.4 is higher in iras  201812244 compared to other nls1s ( halpern & moran 1998 ) .",
    "goodrich ( 1989 ) also showed that the three nls1 galaxies in his sample with @xmath43 have high [ ] @xmath15007/h@xmath2 ratios .",
    "iras  201812244 is a luminous optical and x - ray source .",

    "<S> we observed the narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies iras  201812244 and iras  133243809 with a new spectropolarimeter on the rc spectrograph at the ctio 4 m telescope . </S>",
    "<S> previously it had been suggested that iras  201812244 was a type 2 qso and thus might contain an obscured broad - line region which could be detected by the presence of broad balmer lines in the polarized flux . </S>",
    "<S> we found the object to be polarized at about 2% , and constant with wavelength , ( unlike most narrow - line seyfert  1s ) , but with no evidence of broad balmer lines in polarized flux . </S>",
    "<S> the spectropolarimetry indicates that the scattering material is inside the blr . </S>",
    "<S> iras  132243809 , notable for its high variability in x - ray and uv wavelengths , has a low polarization consistent with a galactic interstellar origin .    </S>",
