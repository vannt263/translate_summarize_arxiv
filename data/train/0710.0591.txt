    "we used that same technique to derive the 1 @xmath23 uncertainty in the h@xmath0o ice column densities .",
    "because direct measurements of the total hydrogen column density are not possible toward the region we mapped , we estimated the total column density of hydrogen nuclei by fitting the observed 9.7 @xmath1 m silicate absorption feature ( sl1 data alone ) with a linear combination of ( i ) a first - order polynomial , ( ii ) the renormalized synthetic galactic extinction curve per unit hydrogen column calculated for @xmath25 5.5 ( weingartner & draine 2001 ; li & draine 2001 ; draine 2003a & b ) and , ( iii ) three gaussian functions with fixed widths and centroids to account for emission from the h@xmath0 @xmath12(4 ) , h@xmath0 @xmath12(2 ) and [ ] lines ( @xmath268.02 , 12.24 and 12.81 @xmath1 m , respectively ) . because numerous silicate features show signs of saturation in their cores toward cepheus a east , we restricted our fits to the wings of the observed silicate profiles ( from 7.7 to 8.95 @xmath1 m and 12 to 14 @xmath1 m ) .",
    "note also that our fitting model assumes that most of the dust resides in a cold foreground component with no significant contribution of background emission from hot dust .",
    "if there were underlying silicate emissions produced by hot dust in addition to the absorption due to cold dust , then one should regard our hydrogen column density estimates as lower limits to the true columns along the probed sight lines containing hot dust ( gillett et al .",
    "figure  2 displays examples of best fits ( thick red curves ) to the observed 9.7 @xmath1 m silicate profile ( black curves ) at two spatial positions : the region around the protostellar source hw2 believed to power the ehv outflow ( _ upper panel _ ) and the region around two radio - continuum sources ( hw5 & hw6 ) where interaction between the ehv outflow and the ambient material is believed to take place ( _ lower panel _ ; see also goetz et al .",
    "1998 ; sonnentrucker et al . 2006 ) .",
    "we also produced an additional set of fits to the observed silicate profiles using the synthetic galactic extinction curve per unit hydrogen column calculated for @xmath273.1 in order to assess the impact that dust properties have on our hydrogen column density estimates .",
    "we find that the hydrogen columns derived assuming dust properties consistent with @xmath273.1 are systematically greater by @xmath418% than those derived assuming @xmath275.5 .",
    "thus , while the dust properties adopted to fit the observed silicate features do affect the overall hydrogen column density scale we derived , these assumptions do not affect the local spatial variations that we see in the @xmath13(h@xmath14 ) distribution shown in fig .  3 , assuming that the silicate profiles scale with @xmath13(h@xmath14 ) .",
    "since a number of studies suggested that the average galactic extinction curve calculated for @xmath27 5.5 is most appropriate to describe the extinction properties of dense molecular clouds ( e.g. , sharpless 1952 ; vrba & rydgren 1984 ; whittet et al .",
    "2001 ) , we adopted the total hydrogen column densities obtained with the dust extinction properties corresponding to @xmath27 5.5 for the remainder of our study . with the latter dust grain model",
    ", the extinction per hydrogen column has a value of 4.957@xmath510@xmath28 @xmath29/h at 9.7 @xmath1 m ( draine 2003a & b ) .    to estimate the uncertainties in the total hydrogen column density introduced by the adopted silicate profile fitting function , as before we calculated the standard deviation ( @xmath23 ) around our best - fit model to the observed silicate feature in a wavelength range between 13 and 13.95 @xmath1 m in each case",
    "we then increased the best - fit hydrogen column , @xmath13(h@xmath14 ) , by @xmath24 1 @xmath23 , @xmath24 2 @xmath23 and @xmath24 3 @xmath23 and compared these new fits to the observed silicate profiles .",
    "our comparison indicates that a @xmath24 1 @xmath23 error of at least 5% in the derived @xmath13(h@xmath14 )  as shown by the blue dash - dotted lines in fig .  2  often adequately reflects the uncertainties related to our silicate absorption model fits .",
    "we adopted these @xmath24 1 @xmath23 errors on the hydrogen column densities in the subsequent sections when discussing the ice abundance distribution in cepheus a east ( see figs . 5 & 6 ) .",
    "note that chiar et al .",
    "( 2007 , submitted ) recently reported the strength of the silicate feature to be systematically weaker relative to near - ir extinction in molecular clouds compared to diffuse clouds . hence , an additional systematic source of error in our estimate of the total hydrogen column density could also arise from our adopted galactic dense cloud extinction curve model .",

    "additionally , local differences in the ice distributions seem to exist , the most striking being the very patchy and somewhat more extended structures observed for the co@xmath0 ices compared to those observed for the h@xmath0o ices and the silicates around the cepa-1 clump as well as the weak water ice absorption compared to co@xmath0 ice over the region labeled p2 .    the _ lower right panel _ of fig .",

    "the overall spatial variations exhibited by the silicate and the two ice maps are , therefore , not due to a lack of dust continuum emission against which to absorb background light .",
    "previous observations established the presence of an ir reflection nebulosity located a few arcseconds _ north _ of hw2 , which scatters the radiation emanating from the hw2 protostellar region ( e.g. , lenzen et al . 1984 ; goetz et al .",
    "the extent and peak position of the dust emission we measure are consistent with those of this reflection nebulosity , indicating that the dust continuum emission shown here originates from that same region .    figure  4 displays examples of summed spectra in the 5.2 - 17 @xmath1 m range at five positions indicated in the maps of fig .",
    "we generated these data by adding all individual spectra included in a @xmath4 6@xmath11 8@xmath8 region centered on the marked positions in order to increase the lines s / n ratio and minimize effects due to the difference in spatial resolution between the low- and the high - resolution data .",

    "in particular , note the complete absence of gas - phase emission features but the presence of strong solid state absorption features at the hw2 position , in contrast with the rich gas - phase spectrum and the weak ice features at the @xmath38 position . a comparison of positions p1 and p2 further illustrates potential local spatial variations in the co@xmath0 ice and h@xmath0o ice contents , as already suggested by the maps of fig .",
    "finally , variations in the 15.2 @xmath1 m co@xmath0 ice profile are also seen and are indicative of spatial changes in the ice mantle composition and/or in the thermal history of this star forming region ( see section 5.4 and gerakines et al .",

    "most importantly , van den ancker et al . measured no difference between the 3 and 6 @xmath1 m water ice column densities over this region , implying that no significant blending of the 6 @xmath1 m ice feature occurs over the cepa-2 , -3 and ehv outflow regions .    in order to determine whether significant blending might occur over the cepa-1 nh@xmath30(1,1 ) cloud where the water ice column is the highest in our data , we compared the water ice and total hydrogen column density distributions derived from our summed spectra .",

    "the pearson correlation coefficient for water ice is @xmath420.76 , much higher than the minimum correlation coefficient required to ensure a chance probability lower than 1% .",
    "our data , hence , indicate that the water ice and the hydrogen column densities do increase together thereby implying that the two species predominantly arise from the same cold molecular clumps ( as found for co@xmath0 ices ) .    as for co@xmath0 ice",
    ", we calculated the linear combination that best fitted our data points for water ice .",

    "departures from the best linear fit to our data are noticeable for three spatial regions marked a , b and p1 ( see fig .",
    ". inspection of the summed spectra indicates that these positions correspond to the peaks in h@xmath0o ice column seen in fig .  3 ( _ upper right _ ) , at the location of the cepa-1 nh@xmath30(1,1 ) clump . to our knowledge ,",
    "no data containing the 3 @xmath1 m water ice band are available over this particular region .",
    "we are , thus , unable to determine whether the local enhancements we observe in the water ice columns are real or due to blending with unidentified species . as in the case of the co@xmath0 ices , the best - fit line to the h@xmath0o ice - total hydrogen relationship shows an intercept consistent ( within large errors ) with the water ice extinction threshold of 3.2 @xmath24 0.1 mag and corresponding to @xmath13(h@xmath14 ) @xmath44 6.1 @xmath5 10@xmath45 @xmath46 , determined by whittet et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .    in light of the good correlation between @xmath13(h@xmath0o)@xmath3 and @xmath13(h@xmath14 ) , we derived the water ice abundance  @xmath2(h@xmath0o)@xmath3 by dividing @xmath13(h@xmath0o)@xmath3 by its corresponding total hydrogen column density in all cases .",
    "the slope of the best - fit line displayed in figure  6 indicates that the h@xmath0o ice distribution shows an average abundance of @xmath2(h@xmath0o)@xmath50 ( 7.5 @xmath24 1.7 ) @xmath5 10@xmath6 , a value are consistent with those observed elsewhere ( e.g. , nummelin et al .",
    "2001 ; boogert et al .",
    "2004 ) over the region mapped both in sl and sh . within errors , the h@xmath0o ice abundance excesses observed for the regions labeled a , b and p1 again correspond to @xmath13(h@xmath0o)@xmath55 9 @xmath5 10@xmath56 @xmath46 , i.e. the high - end of the water ice column density distribution where blending with unidentified features is most likely to have occurred .",
    "the formation , destruction and evolution of ices are believed to be governed by relatively few processes intimately linked to the local physical conditions : 1 ) energetic processes involving uv photolysis and cosmic - ray bombardment ; 2 ) grain surface reactions ; 3 ) thermal processing of the ice mantles by embedded protostars ; and 4 ) sputtering in shocks .",
    "because co@xmath0 ices are readily formed via uv photolysis in the laboratory , this formation mechanism was favored to account for the routine detection of co@xmath0 ices toward star - forming regions . however , the detection of relatively high fractions of co@xmath0 ice relative to h@xmath0o ice toward quiescent clouds and the intra - cloud medium indicated that co@xmath0 ices can be formed in environments devoid of embedded sources of radiation with a typical fraction with respect to water ice of 17% ( e.g. , whittet et al .",
    "1998 ; bergin et al . 2005 ; whittet et al . 2007 ) .",
    "thus , co@xmath0 ice formation mechanisms , other then uv photolysis , need be considered ( e.g. , charnley et al . 1997 ; ruffle & herbst 2001 ) .    figure 7 compares the column density distribution of co@xmath0 ices @xmath57 that of water ice for the 28 contiguous summed spectra common to the sl and sh maps of cepheus a east .",
    "the thick black line represents the typical ism fraction of co@xmath0 ice with respect to water ice of 17% ( gerakines et al .",
    "the thin black line shows the best fit to our measurements excluding regions a , b and p1 where potential significant blending of the 6 @xmath1 m water ice feature might occur .",
    "a slope of 22 @xmath24 3% fit our data points best .",
    "we find a pearson correlation coefficient of 0.77 .",
    "for our sample size , this value is much greater than the minimum coefficient of 0.48 required for the correlation to be significant at a 1% level .",
    "our data , therefore , indicate that the co@xmath0 ice and the water ice build up in concert onto dust grains under very similar physical conditions and that they essentially coexist in the same ice mixture .",
    "our results strengthen the case that these two species formed together as discussed by bergin et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , with a co@xmath0 ice fraction with respect to water ice overall similar to those toward the typical quiescent molecular clouds studied so far ( e.g. , whittet et al . 2007 ) .",
    "therefore , grain surface reactions rather than uv photolysis seem to be the most likely co@xmath0 ice production mechanism toward most parts of the star - forming region mapped in this study .",
    "however , note that local co@xmath0 ice enhancements with respect to water ice are clearly observed in our data , mostly around p2 and around the region centered at ( @xmath522;@xmath5816 ) ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , suggesting the existence of additional sources of co@xmath0 ice .",
    "variations in the co@xmath0 ice fraction compared to the typical ism value were reported previously toward other sources ( e.g. , whittet et al .",
    "1998 ; nummelin et al . 2001 ; boogert et al .",
    "2004 ) and mechanisms such as uv or / and thermal processing were invoked . in the present case ,",
    "the local co@xmath0 ice excesses we observe coincide mostly with the region where a high - velocity ( hv ) jet interacts with the cepa-3 molecular clump .",
    "goetz et al . ( 1998 ) reported the presence of compact regions along this ( hv ) jet providing local sources of uv radiation .",
    "one might , thus , conjecture that the co@xmath0 excesses with respect to h@xmath0o ice",
    "we measure at the latter positions result from photochemistry involving co and o@xmath0 ( e.g. , sandford & allamandola 1990 ; whittet et al . 1996 ) . since we do not possess information concerning the co ice distribution in the region mapped with _",
    "spitzer _ we are , however , unable to further test this possibility at present .",
    "laboratory experiments have shown that , upon heating , ice mixtures with various concentrations of h@xmath0o , co@xmath0 and ch@xmath30oh undergo crystallization leading to an effective segregation of the ice constituents in the mixtures ( e.g. , ehrenfreund et al . 1997 ; 1999 ) .",
    "observationally , such a phenomenon is detectable through the appearance of multiple substructures in the profile of the co@xmath0 ice bands .",
    "such multiple peaked structures can not be produced by uv irradiation in the laboratory ( ehrenfreund et al .",
    "the profile of the co@xmath0 @xmath7 bending mode ( 15.2 @xmath1 m ) has been shown to be the most sensitive to the ice mantle composition and to the mantle thermal processing by nearby protostars .",
    "in particular , the presence of a sharp double - peaked structure at @xmath415.2 @xmath1 m along with a broader feature around 15.4 @xmath1 m in the co@xmath0 profile , has been recognized as a signature of thermal processing of ice mixtures containing roughly equal amounts of h@xmath0o , co@xmath0 and ch@xmath30oh .",
    "the long - wavelength shoulder is characteristic of segregation of co@xmath0 and ch@xmath30oh in the ice mantle upon heating ( e.g. , ehrenfreund et al .",
    "comparisons of the observed 15.2 @xmath1 m band profiles with laboratory interstellar ice analogs have subsequently led to a better understanding of the composition of interstellar ice mantles and have allowed us to constrain the local molecular environment these ice mantles are subjected to ( e.g. , gerakines et al . 1999 ; nummelin et al .",
    "2001 ; boogert et al .",
    "2004 ; bergin et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "all co@xmath0 bands we mapped with sufficient s / n ratio exhibit a sharp double - peak substructure along with a broad long - wavelength shoulder of variable intensity , as shown in fig .  4 .",
    "to compare our observations with the currently available laboratory interstellar ice analogs ( ehrenfreund et al . 1997 , 1999 ) , we derived the co@xmath0 optical depth profiles by fitting a third - degree polynomial to the local continuum around the 15 @xmath1 m band and we adopted the fitting method described in gerakines et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to constrain the ice mantle composition toward cepheus a east . because the co@xmath0 ice bands expand over two sh orders which overlap around 15.2 @xmath1 m , we only retained those spectra with the highest s / n ratio and no apparent order - edge mismatches to ensure that the most accurate fits to both the band wings and the sharp substructures are obtained .",
    "examples of such optical depth spectra are shown in figure 8 ( black curves ) along with their respective best laboratory ice analog fits ( red curves ) .    in all cases ,",
    "our best fits require two ice components at two different laboratory temperatures , a broad polar component ( h@xmath0o : co@xmath0:co 100:20:3 ) at 20 k ( blue curve in fig .",
    "8) and a triple - peaked methanol - rich mixture ( h@xmath0o : ch@xmath30oh : co@xmath0 1:1:1 ) at 119 k ( green curve in fig .",
    "8) years toward cep a east , then the 119k laboratory temperature we obtain from our fits effectively corresponds to an ism segregation temperature of @xmath476k ( e.g. boogert et al .",
    "2000 ) . ] . from these best fits",
    "we estimate that the fraction of low - temperature ice present in the mantles ranges from 25 % at the position of hw2 ( fig .  8 , upper panel ) to 40% over the cepa-2 region ( fig .",
    "8 , lower panel ) .",
    "to evaluate the robustness of our ice mixture solution and because the optical depth spectra are very sensitive to the continuum normalization , we produced a second dataset using a spline function to fit the local continuum .",
    "we fitted this second set of optical depth spectra with the same ice mixtures and laboratory temperatures but allowing the cold - ice fraction to vary .",
    "the range in cold - ice fraction which led to these new best fits is reported in figure 8 for each spectrum . within errors ,",
    "our data indicate that the concentration of low - temperature ice is of at least 30% over the 4 probed positions which were chosen to be representative of the ice composition over the mapped cepheus region .",
    "local variations in the low - temperature ice fraction seem to exist with a slight increase of this concentration when moving toward the cepa-2 clump and away from the _ ne _ outflow activity ( 2 lower panels of fig .",
    "the need for an increasingly large fraction of a high - temperature ice mixture containing methanol in the fits indicates that the ice mantles experienced significant thermal processing over the history of the region , leading to segregation of the co@xmath0 and methanol ices in the mantles .",
    "we used new _ spitzer _",
    "data obtained with the irs instrument to produce fully sampled maps of the distribution of co@xmath0 ices ( 15.2 @xmath1 m ) , h@xmath0o ices ( 6.02 @xmath1 m ) and total hydrogen nuclei , as inferred from the 9.7 @xmath1 m silicate feature , toward the star - forming region cepheus a east .",
    "we find that all solid state features peak at , and are distributed closely around , the spatial position of the deeply embedded protostar hw2 and coinciding with the nh@xmath30(1,1 ) molecular clump cepa-1 .",
    "otherwise , the distributions show column densities lower by about a factor 2 than those measured over the cepa-1 region .",
    "the correlations we observe between the co@xmath0 ice , the h@xmath0o ice column density distributions and that of total hydrogen imply that the solid state features predominantly arise from the same molecular clouds along the probed sight lines .",
    "we hence derived the co@xmath0 and water ice abundances with respect to the measured total hydrogen column density at each summed spatial position in the map .",
    "we find an average co@xmath0 ice abundance of ( 1.9 @xmath24 0.4 ) @xmath5 10@xmath6 and an average h@xmath0o ice abundance of ( 7.5 @xmath24 1.7 ) @xmath5 10@xmath6 over the probed region .",
    "a comparison of the co@xmath0 and water ice column density distributions indicates that both ices build up onto dust grains , in concert , over the probed region .",
    "the fairly good correlation between the column densities of the two ices also indicates that blending of the water ice band by unidentified features is not significant in our data .",
    "overall , we find that @xmath13(co@xmath0)@xmath50 ( 0.22 @xmath24 0.03 ) @xmath5 @xmath13(h@xmath0o)@xmath3 , a fraction similar to that typically found in the intra - could medium and toward quiescent molecular clouds ( 17 % ) , suggesting that grain surface chemistry is the most likely production mechanism of co@xmath0 ices toward this region .",
    "best fits to the co@xmath0 ice bending mode using the current laboratory interstellar ice analogs database indicate that the ice mantles in cepheus a east are composed of 2 ice mixtures , a low - temperature ( @xmath59=20k ) polar ice mixture and a high - temperature ( @xmath59=119k ) methanol - rich mixture .",
    "we find that while about 30% of the probed ice mantles is at low temperature , variations of the cold - ice fraction also seem to exist over the probed region .",
    "the presence of the high - temperature methanol - rich ice mixture is indicative of significant thermal processing of a fraction of these ice mantles over cepheus a east history .",
