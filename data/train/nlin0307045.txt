    "linear differential operators admitting darboux transformations ( dts ) play a crucial role in the theory of integrable systems @xcite .",
    "i ) one can associate with such operators integrable nonlinear partial differential equations ( pdes ) .",
    "ii ) one can make use of the spectral theory of such linear operators to solve classical initial - boundary value problem for the nonlinear pdes .",
    "iii ) one can construct solutions of the nonlinear equations from simpler solutions , using the darboux - bcklund transformations .",
    "iv ) one can often associate with the nonlinear pde a geometric meaning , inherited by the geometric properties of the linear operator .",
    "it is natural to search for a discretization of this beautiful picture . in general , searching for distinguished discretizations of linear differential operators that admit general dts ( integrable discretizations ) is not a trivial task .",
    "several methods of `` integrable discretization '' have been used so far ( see e.g. @xcite ) , but no one is fully satisfactory .",
    "surprisingly enough , a distinguished integrable discretization of the two - dimensional stationary schrdinger equation is , to the best of our knowledge , not present in the literature and one of our goals is to change this situation .    in recent years",
    "the study of linear difference equations that admit dts were undertaken .",
    "most of the results are based on the 4-point difference scheme , i.e. a scheme that relates four neighbouring points @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 are real functions of two discrete variables @xmath3 and where the standard notation @xmath4 is used throughout the paper ) , which is proper for discretizing second order hyperbolic equations in the canonical form . in particular , the proper discrete analogue of the laplace equation for conjugate nets @xmath5 whose dts were obtained in @xcite , turns out to be the 4-point scheme @xcite @xmath6 describing a lattice with planar quadrilaterals @xcite , @xcite , whose general dts were extensively studied in recent years ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . while the moutard equation @xcite @xmath7 relevant in the description of asymptotic nets , splits naturally in the discrete case into two equations @xcite @xmath8 admitting dts .",
    "laplace transformations for the general 4-point scheme ( [ 4point ] ) are also known @xcite .",
    "the discretization of elliptic equations in two dimensions admitting general dts is much less studied and understood . in the continuous case , elliptic equations and their darboux transformations are often obtained from the hyperbolic ones regarding @xmath9 as complex variables : @xmath10 but this approach presents some problems in the discrete case .    in our opinion ,",
    "a proper discretization of an elliptic operator should satisfy two basic properties .",
    "* it should be applicable to solve generic dirichlet boundary value problems on a 2d lattice ; * it should possess a class of dts which must be ( at least ) as rich as that of its differential counterpart .",
    "it is very easy to convince one - self that the first criterion can not be satisfied by the 4-point scheme ( [ 4point ] ) and that at least 5-point difference schemes should be introduced @xcite .",
    "the most general 5-point scheme reads as follows : @xmath11 where @xmath12 are functions of the discrete variables @xmath3 .",
    "its natural continuous limit @xmath13 in which the lattice spacing @xmath14 goes to zero and @xmath15 @xmath16+o(\\epsilon^3),\\ ] ] gives the following second order pde in the independent variables @xmath17 @xmath18 in which the @xmath19 term is missing ( we remark that the @xmath19 term is instead the only second order term present in equations ( [ conj ] ) and ( [ mout ] ) ) . equation ( [ lpsic ] ) is elliptic if @xmath20 and its canonical form is obtained by setting @xmath21 .",
    "the functions @xmath22 measure the departure of equations ( [ lpsi ] ) and ( [ lpsic ] ) from self - adjointness , which is a basic property in most of the applications .",
    "in this paper we present the following results .",
    "* we construct the dts for the self - adjoint reductions of the 5-point scheme and of its continuous limit .",
    "* we use the gauge covariance property of the general self - adjoint 5-point scheme to construct a distinguished integrable discrete analogue of the stationary schrdinger operator in two dimensions .",
    "`` integrable '' in the sense that , not only it reduces to the stationary schrdinger operator in the continuous limit , but also it possesses dts .",
    "* we show that the construction of dts for the self - adjoint 5-point scheme can be applied to the case of self - adjoint schemes involving more neighbouring points , illustrating such a generalization in the case of the general self - adjoint 7-point scheme , for which laplace transformations are already known @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sad ] is devoted to the construction of the dts for the most general self - adjoint 5-point difference operator with complex coefficients : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the translation operators with respect to the discrete variables @xmath26 : @xmath27 and @xmath28 are complex functions of the two discrete variables @xmath3 .",
    "we also use the following difference operators @xmath29 the operator @xmath30 is formally self - adjoint with respect to the bilinear form : @xmath31 and , in the particular case @xmath32 , it reduces to the 5-point scheme @xmath33 which is the simplest and most used ( in numerical applications ) discretization of the schrdinger operator @xmath34 while the further constraint @xmath35 leads to @xmath36 i.e. to a discretization of the laplacian @xmath37 often used in the numerical studies of elliptic boundary value problems @xcite .    in the continuous limit",
    ", the operator @xmath30 goes to the second order partial differential operator @xmath38 which is formally self - adjoint with respect to the bilinear form : @xmath39    we notice that , while both operators ( [ selfa ] ) , ( [ selfa ] ) are self - adjoint , the two `` integrable '' discretizations of the self - adjoint moutard equation are just mutually adjoint .    in section [ sch ] , using the following covariance property ( gauge invariance ) of the operator @xmath30 : @xmath40 we draw the operator @xmath41 to the form @xmath42 the operator , symmetric with respect to @xmath43 rotations in the plane grid @xmath44 , reduces to the two - dimensional schrdinger operator under the natural continuous limit and possesses dts .",
    "therefore it appears as the `` integrable '' discrete analogue of the two - dimensional schrdinger operator .",
    "it is therefore the proper starting point in the search for the integrable discrete analogues of the nonlinear pdes of elliptic type associated with ( like the veselov - novikov hierarchy @xcite , nonlinear @xmath0 models @xcite and the ernst equation @xcite ) .",
    "the corresponding gauge transformation for the operator @xmath45 in ( [ selfa ] ) is @xmath46    we draw the reader s attention to the fact that constraint @xmath47 is conserved by the gauge transformation and the same is true for the constraint @xmath48 with respect to gauge . in the case of the reduction @xmath47",
    ", the operator can be gauged into the form of the 2d schrdinger operator while , in the case @xmath49 , the operator can be gauged into the operator .",
    "but while there exist dts which preserves the form of equation , we do nt know dts that preserves the form of equation .",
    "this is the reason why we view the operator and not the operator as the integrable discretization of the schrdinger equation .",
    "finally , in section [ sad7 ] we show that there is another self - adjoint scheme involving more neighbouring points which possess dts of the type presented in section [ sad ] .",
    "it is a self - adjoint 7-point difference scheme    @xmath50    which , in the continuous limit @xmath51 @xmath52+o(\\epsilon^3)\\ ] ] goes to the most general second order self - adjoint differential equation in two independent variables : @xmath53    the operator @xmath54 in ( [ selfa7 ] ) , introduced in @xcite , admits the representation @xmath55 in terms of a 3-point difference operator @xmath56 and of its adjoint @xmath57 , and this factorization plays a crucial role in the construction of laplace transformations for @xmath54 @xcite and in the development of an associated discrete complex function theory @xcite .",
    "the 5-point operator @xmath30 does not admit the above representation and the construction of the dts of this paper does not make use of it .",
    "we also remark that several discretizations of the 1d schrdinger operator have appeared in the literature throughout the years ( see , f.i .",
    ", @xcite and @xcite with references therein included ) .",
    "we end this introduction observing that a 4-point scheme with a complexification of the discrete variables @xmath44 analogous to , was used in @xcite to construct a discrete analogue of the @xmath0 model .",
    "in this section we present a darboux transformation for the equation :    @xmath58    where @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are given functions .",
    "let @xmath62 be another solution of ( [ saeq ] ) , i.e : @xmath63 then : @xmath64 eliminating @xmath61 from and we get @xmath65 it means that there exists a function @xmath66 such that @xmath67 setting @xmath68 we find that @xmath69 satisfies the following equation @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 comparing equations ( [ ff ] ) and ( [ ff ] ) , we also infer that @xmath73 is a solution of ( [ saeqp ] ) .    in the continuous limit ( [ limit ] ) , with @xmath74 and with",

    "the operator can be gauged into the form . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath59 and @xmath60 are given functions , one can find a function @xmath85 such that @xmath86 and , under the gauge , we get @xmath87 . finally , the operator @xmath88 given by @xmath89 is of the wanted form .    combining the dt of the previous section with the above gauge transformation , one obtains the following dt for the discrete analogue of the schrdinger operator .",
    "let @xmath90 be a solution of the integrable discrete analogue of the 2d schrdinger operator : @xmath91 and let @xmath92 be another solution of it .",
    "it means that @xmath93 eliminating @xmath61 from and we get that there exists a function @xmath94 , given in quadratures by @xmath95 which satisfies @xmath96 where @xmath97 + \\frac{{\\vartheta}}{{\\gamma } } [ ( \\frac{{\\gamma}}{{\\vartheta}})_{m-1,n}+ ( \\frac{{\\gamma}}{{\\vartheta}})_{m , n-1 } ] .",
