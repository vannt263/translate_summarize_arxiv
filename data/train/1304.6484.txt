    "the breaking of lorentz symmetry is an extensively studied topic .",
    "although no departure from lorentz invariance has yet been detected experimentally , there is no reason to believe that lorentz invariance would be intact at all energies . as a matter of fact , there are reasons to suspect its exactness in the context of string theory . for example , the potential instability of string vacuum would induce spontaneous breakdown of lorentz symmetry @xcite . also , high - energy field theories constructed on a moyal space , viewed as low - energy effective theories from open string theory with a constant ns - ns @xmath0 field , explicitly spoil lorentz invariance @xcite .",
    "one direction in the study of lorentz violation is to regard lorentz symmetry breaking as a possible extension of the standard model in particle physics .",
    "the first work in this context is the investigation of the carroll - field - jackiw term @xcite , which has inspired numbers of studies in recent years . without the criterion of lorentz symmetry",
    ", one may construct new additive terms to the minimal standard model . note",
    "that since @xmath1 invariance is necessary but not sufficient for lorentz invariance of an interacting quantum field theory @xcite , lorentz violating ( lv ) terms can be either @xmath1 even or @xmath1 odd .",
    "lv terms of renormalizable dimensions have been systematically constructed in @xcite , known as the standard model extension , and many related issues have been discussed @xcite .",
    "however , experimental data put very stringent constraints on the renormalizable lv terms and indicate that they must be extremely small . to avoid the subtle fine - tuning problem @xcite",
    ", we assume that the symmetry of the underlying theory prohibits the generation of the renormalizable lv operators and explore the nonrenormalizable lv operators in this paper .    renormalizability was considered to be an axiom when constructing the standard model .",
    "quantum corrections to a renormalizable theory will generate uv divergences only to operators whose mass dimensions are less than five and this fact assures the predictiveness of the theory .",
    "however , a modern point of view is that reliable predictions could still be made from a nonrenormalizable theory within the framework of effective field theories .",
    "thus , higher - dimensional lv operators should also be considered , and several studies involving dimension - five lv operators have been carried out @xcite .    in this paper , assuming a fixed vector background @xmath2 to be the only source that induces the breaking of lorentz symmetry , we shall consider the spinor electrodynamics modified by some dimension - five lv interactions between fermions and photons .",
    "higher - dimensional interactions are best classified in terms of derivative expansion .",
    "dimension - five interactions are quadratic in gauge covariant derivative @xmath3 , which is given by @xmath4 . recall that @xmath5=i f^{\\mu\\nu}$ ] , where @xmath6 is the electromagnetic tensor .",
    "if we restrict ourself to consider only terms linear in the vector background @xmath2 and the photon field @xmath7 , then the most general dimension - five interactions are of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 being dimensionless constants .",
    "the factor @xmath12 in @xmath13 is introduced for later convenience .",
    "one can easily see that the mass dimension of the background vector @xmath2 is @xmath14=-1 $ ] .",
    "note that each term in  ( [ llv ] ) violates @xmath1 .",
    "while @xmath10 terms preserve @xmath15 parity ( and thus violate @xmath16 ) , @xmath11 terms violated it ( and thus preserve @xmath16 ) .",
    "constraints from the electric dipole moments of paramagnetic atoms put very stringent limits on @xmath11 terms @xcite .",
    "therefore , we will not discuss @xmath15-violating terms in this paper and simply set @xmath17 from now on .",
    "the modified qed , after rescaling the background @xmath2 by absorbing the parameter @xmath18 , then reads @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the dual electromagnetic tensor , @xmath21 .",
    "the lorentz symmetry @xmath22 is broken by the irrelevant dimension - five operators to its subgroup @xmath23 , which admits the background vector @xmath2 as an invariant tensor . at low energies , effects due to nonrenormalizable couplings are suppressed at least by powers of @xmath24 , with @xmath25 being some fundamental large mass scale in the underlying theory . in the limit @xmath26 , the symmetry of the lagrange density  ( [ l ] )",
    "is enhanced to the lorentz group , along with spacetime translations .",
    "the two lv terms in  ( [ l ] ) have been considered in refs .",
    "the crucial difference between the existing works related to these two terms and the lagrange density  ( [ l ] ) considered in this paper is that the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath27 in  ( [ l ] ) is the unique gauge coupling constant determining the strength of the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "thus , different from other works , we restrict our consideration to the case where electrically neutral particles will not interact with photons at tree level .",
    "this can be seen even more transparently by letting @xmath28 so that  ( [ l ] ) becomes @xmath29 where the gauge covariant derivative now takes the form @xmath30 and the @xmath31-vector @xmath32 is the current density",
    ". apparently @xmath33 reduces to the free theory for neutral particles .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized into three parts . in sec .",
    "ii , we examine the qed modified by the dimension - five lv operator , @xmath34 .",
    "the theoretical consequences of the modified maxwell and dirac equations are studied .",
    "in particular , we compute the corrections to the hydrogen spectrum by applying the perturbation theory to the exactly solved dirac equation . to our knowledge , the corrections to the hydrogen spectrum induced by the lv operator @xmath35 were calculated only in the nonrelativistic limit in the literature @xcite .",
    "the effect on the spectral lines of hydrogen atom due to the presence of a static external electric field and a static external magnetic field is also considered . in sec .",
    "iii , we present similar analysis on the qed modified by another dimension - five lv operator , @xmath36 .",
    "we give our conclusions in the final section .",
    "our starting point is the following modified qed lagrange density : @xmath37 the field equations derived from @xmath38 read ] @xmath39 the continuity equation @xmath40 follows from  ( [ l1eom ] ) as a result of gauge symmetry .",
    "the field equations  ( [ l1eom ] ) can be rewritten in terms of components as the familiar form of inhomogeneous maxwell equations .",
    "together with the homogeneous maxwell equations coming from the gauge invariance of the system , we have @xmath41 here the effective displacement field @xmath42 and the effective magnetic field @xmath43 are defined as @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively , where the effective polarization @xmath46 and the effective magnetization @xmath47 , defined by @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively , are the components of the rank-@xmath50 object @xmath51}$ ] : @xmath52 lorentz symmetry of the maxwell equations is spoiled by the nonzero effective polarization or the nonzero effective magnetization . in the presence of stationary sources ( such that @xmath53 ) , the solution of the gauge field @xmath54 is @xmath55 and @xmath56 consequently , one can see that a static electric field can arise from stationary and neutral sources ( @xmath57 ) as long as the effective polarization is not divergence - free .",
    "also , even for the steady and irrotational current density ( such that both the divergence and the curl of @xmath58 vanish ) , a nonvanishing magnetic field @xmath59 may still arise from @xmath60 with @xmath61 given by @xmath62    we now switch to the fermion sector in  ( [ l1 ] ) .",
    "the equation of motion for the fermion @xmath63 following from @xmath38 is @xmath64 multiplying on the left by the dirac matrix @xmath65 , we can identify the hamiltonian operator of one - particle quantum mechanics : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the dirac hamiltonian and @xmath68 is the lv perturbation .",
    "it is well known that hydrogen atom can be solved exactly in dirac s theory and the fine structure of the hydrogen spectrum comes out naturally from it . using degenerate perturbation theory , we are able to compute the first - order correction to the hydrogen spectrum induced by @xmath69 .    since the degenerate unperturbed states are the stationary state vectors",
    "@xmath70 of the dirac hamiltonian @xmath71 for a fixed @xmath72 and @xmath73 , in the absence of external fields we need to calculate the following matrix elements of the perturbation :    @xmath74    where the coulomb field @xmath75 is given by @xmath76 .",
    "the term @xmath77 in @xmath69 originates from the @xmath78-even operator @xmath79 in @xmath38 .",
    "we note in passing that the energy shifts are independent of the time component @xmath80 of the background vector , indicating that the hydrogen spectrum is insensitive to the breakdown of invariance under lorentz boosts .",
    "it is easy to show that the matrix elements  ( [ ma ] ) of the perturbation between state vectors with different eigenvalues for the square of the orbital angular momentum @xmath81 or the @xmath82 component @xmath83 of the total angular momentum all vanish . indeed , by judiciously choosing a coordinate system such that @xmath84",

    "it follows then that the matrix elements  ( [ ma ] ) vanishes unless @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "to evaluate the expectation value in the unperturbed state of the perturbation , we recall that the unperturbed wave functions in dirac representation take the form @xmath89 here the radial wave functions @xmath90 are given by @xmath91f(-{n'},2\\gamma+1;2{\\mu}r ) { \\pm}{n'}f(1-{n'},2\\gamma+1;2{\\mu}r)\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 @xmath93 is the fine structure constant given by @xmath94 , and @xmath95 is the electron mass .",

    "figure 1 shows the low - lying energy levels of the hydrogen atom .",
    "note that the energy shifts @xmath104 is of order @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is a dimensionless product .",
    "this is a tiny effect in comparison with the lamb shift , which is of order @xmath107 , and the hyperfine splitting , which is of order @xmath108 with @xmath109 being the mass of the proton , since the irrelevant lv operator @xmath110 is highly suppressed by some large fundamental mass scale @xmath25 mentioned in the introduction .",
    "[ loop ]    we are now in a position to consider the shift of the hydrogen energy levels in the presence of a uniform external magnetic field @xmath111 , assuming that its strength is weak in comparison with the field produced by the proton .",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonian is taken to be the dirac hamiltonian @xmath71 in the absence of the magnetic field .",

    "the constant term @xmath122 in @xmath69 just shifts each energy level by the same amount .",

    "<S> assuming lorentz symmetry is broken by some fixed vector background , we study the spinor electrodynamics modified by two dimension - five lorentz - violating interactions between fermions and photons . the effective polarization and magnetization are identified from the modified maxwell equations , and the theoretical consequences are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> we also compute the corrections to the relativistic energy levels of hydrogen atom induced by these lorentz - violating operators in the absence and presence of uniform external fields in first - order perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the hydrogen spectrum is insensitive to the breakdown of lorentz boost symmetry . </S>"
