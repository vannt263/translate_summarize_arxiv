    "a linear differential system @xmath0 where @xmath1 are constant @xmath2-matrices , @xmath3 is diagonal , @xmath4 a parameter , is called an _ okubo system _ , or also a _",
    "hypergeometric system_. such systems appear as a natural generalization of the hypergeometric equation .",
    "it is known @xcite , that every single fuchsian differential equation can be reduced to such a system .",
    "the assumption that @xmath3 is diagonal ( or semisimple ) assures that the 1-form @xmath5 has only simple poles ( placed at the eigenvalues of @xmath3 and at @xmath6 ) , i.e. that all the singularities of the okubo system are fuchsian .",
    "the okubo system appears also as a dual to a system in _",
    "birkhoff normal form _ @xmath7 which has an irregular singular point at 0 and a fuchsian singular point at @xmath6 , through the laplace",
    "transform @xmath8 this fact can be used to express the stokes and connection matrices of the birkhoff system in terms of connection matrices and monodromies of the dual okubo system @xcite .",
    "schfke @xcite has remarked that the the system can be also obtained from by the following confluence procedure : @xmath9 then @xmath10 satisfies @xmath11 which becomes at the limit when @xmath12 .    in case of rank @xmath13 and @xmath3 with two distinct eigenvalues",
    ", this confluence procedure corresponds exactly to the confluence of the ( gauss ) hypergeometric equation to the ( kummer s ) confluent hypergeometric equation .    aside from the usual local levelt bases at each of the singularities , the okubo system has two other kinds of natural solution bases , so called _ mixed bases _ @xcite : the first one , called _ floquet basis _ , consists of the floquet solutions ( singular levelt solutions ) at different finite singularities @xmath14 ( eigenvalues of @xmath3 ) . the other , called _ co - floquet basis _",
    ", is in a sense dual ; a co - floquet solution at a singularity @xmath14 is one that is analytic at al other singularities @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "schfke @xcite has studied the limits of these mixed bases in the confluent family in the case where all the eigenvalues of @xmath3 are distinct and has shown that they both tend to the canonical solution basis of the limit system ( borel sum of a formal fundamental solution ) on sectors at the irregular singularity @xmath17 : the floquet basis when @xmath18 , and the co - floquet basis when @xmath19 .",
    "this article exposes these results while extending them to a more general situation , where @xmath3 is allowed to have multiple eigenvalues , and @xmath20 can go to infinity along any fixed direction in one of two sectors of opening @xmath21 covering a neighborhood of @xmath6 on the riemann sphere @xmath22 . in an analogy with @xcite",
    "it is natural to introduce parametric _ stokes matrices _ of the confluent family , as connection matrices between different branches of the floquet ( resp .",
    "co - floquet ) basis far from the origin .",
    "these parametric stokes matrices are closely related to the monodromy of the family : in general , the monodromy matrices of the floquet and co - floquet bases can be expressed as products of these stokes matrices and formal monodromy matrices . while the monodromy matrices diverge when @xmath12 ( because of their formal monodromy parts which are exponential functions of @xmath20 ) these parametric stokes matrices tend to the usual stokes matrices of the limit system , and can be easily obtained from them ( proposition [ prop : hg - stokesmatrices ] ) .",
    "these results are illustrated in section 2 on explicit calculations in the case of the generalized hypergeometric equation , previously studied by duval @xcite .",
    "duval considered the problem of convergence of the monodromy matrices to the stokes matrices without separating formal monodromy part and the stokes part .",
    "therefore she could only consider limits when @xmath23 following a discrete set of values on which the formal monodromy part is constant .    a different confluence procedure of the type @xmath24 was investigated in e.g. @xcite . in case of @xmath3 having only two eigenvalues ( one of which can be always shifted to 0 ) , the confluence procedure can be considered as a special case of . in this case",
    "our perspective essentially coincides with that of @xcite .",
    "in particular , this includes the confluence in the gauss hypergeometric equations @xcite and in the generalized hypergeometric equation @xcite .",
    "let the matrix @xmath3 be diagonal with eigenvalues @xmath25 of respective multiplicities @xmath26 , and let the matrix @xmath27 be partitioned into blocks accordingly @xmath28 the following * assumption * is made throughout the text : @xmath29    for any @xmath30-matrix @xmath31 , let @xmath32 be its bloc - partition according to @xmath3 , and denote @xmath33 the @xmath34-th bloc column of @xmath31 .",

    "more precisely each its column @xmath41 is borel summable in all directions @xmath42 with @xmath43 disjoint from all @xmath44 , @xmath45 ( such direction @xmath42 will be called _ non - singular _ ) .",

    "<S> a system in a birkhoff normal form with an irregular singularity of poincar rank 1 at the origin and a regular singularity at infinity is through the borel - laplace transform dual to a system in an okubo form . </S>",
    "<S> schfke has showed that the birkhoff system can also be obtained from the okubo system by a simple limiting procedure . </S>",
    "<S> the okubo system comes naturally with two kinds of mixed solution bases , both of which converge under the limit procedure to the canonical solutions of the limit birkhoff system on sectors near the irregular singularity at the origin . </S>",
    "<S> one can then define stokes matrices of the okubo system as connection matrices between different branches of the mixed solution bases and use them to relate the monodromy matrices of the okubo system to the usual stokes matrices of the limit system at the irregular singularity . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated on the example of confluence in the generalized hypergeometric equation . </S>"
