    "charge - ordering ( co ) phenomena , also frequently referred to as charge disproportionation , have been recognized as one of the main issues in the field of correlated electron systems . in particular , charge order has gained particular attention in transition - metal oxides , where , depending on its coupling to spin - ordering , it gives rise to various exotic phenomena @xcite such as ferroelectricity in spiral magnets @xcite and magnetoelectric effects @xcite .",
    "also for various series of molecular conductors , such as ( bedt - ttf)@xmath0x , ( tmttf)@xmath0x as well as ( di - dcnqi)@xmath0x , it has been recently recognized that co plays a key role in the physics of these systems @xcite .",
    "however , co effects observed in these quarter - filled organic salts is only a special realization of the so - called 4@xmath2 charge density wave ( cdw ) instability discovered more than 35 years ago in ttf - tcnq @xcite ( here @xmath2 refers to the fermi wave vector of the non - interacting 1d electron gas ) .",
    "very soon the 4@xmath2 cdw was interpreted within the frame work of the extended hubbard model as being due to a wigner crystallization caused by the long - range coulomb repulsions specific to organic stacking @xcite . in organic systems , it is the anisotropy in the hopping transfer integrals , @xmath3 , and mainly the inter - site coulomb repulsion , @xmath4 , together with the influence from electron - lattice coupling which give rise to a very rich and diverse physics ; for a recent review of all these aspects see e.g. ref.@xcite .",
    "recently , a new type of co with purely ferroelectric character has been reported for ( bedt - ttf)@xmath0x charge - transfer salts @xcite .",
    "the electronic properties of molecular conductors have been intensively discussed in several reviews , see e.g.refs.@xcite and more recently in ref.@xcite .    here",
    "we review literature results on the co transition occurring in the quasi - one dimensional ( 1d ) ( tmttf)@xmath0x fabre salts .",
    "these salts are especially interesting since co gives rise to ferroelectricity @xcite . in addition",
    ", the concomitant spin - charge decoupling favors magnetic coupling which in some case leads to a magnetic ground state . in this framework",
    "it has been proposed @xcite that the interplay between ferroelectricity and magnetism could lead to multiferroicity .",
    "as the fabre salts are soft materials these electronic phenomena are controlled in a subtle manner by the lattice degrees of freedom . concerning the various structural aspects of the so - called fabre - bechgaard salts we refer to ref.@xcite and references therein .",
    "in this review , emphasis will be placed on high - resolution dilatometric measurements performed in these salts in the past few years in order to reveal the effects of the co transition on the lattice counterpart .    following this brief introduction which includes the first section , this brief review is subsequently divided into eight sections , as follows :    * * section ii * : an overview of the main theoretical aspects related to the co transition in quasi-1d organic systems is presented in this section . * * section iii * : this section is dedicated to the structural aspects of fabre - bechgaard salts . in particular , we shall emphasize the coupling between the anions and the acceptors which plays a key role in the stabilization of the co pattern . * * section iv * : the generic phase diagram of the fabre - bechgaard salts is first discussed .",
    "this presentation is followed by a survey of selected literature results related to the co phase transition of the fabre salts . * * section v * : this section gives a general presentation of the thermodynamic quantities related to the thermal expansion . * * sections vi and vii * : these sections , respectively , present and discuss the high - resolution thermal expansion results obtained in the ( tmttf)@xmath0x s . * * section viii * : conclusions , perspectives and an outlook as well as acknowledgements are given here .",
    "in qualitative terms a co transition , frequently referred to in the literature as charge - disproportionation , can be defined as due to the self-(re)arrangement of charge carriers into a well - defined superstructure .",
    "this instability is a direct consequence of the electron - electron repulsions between charges : if the inter - site coulomb repulsion @xmath4 is sufficiently strong and of long - range enough , electrons will reduce the repulsion from each other by taking equidistant positions . in 1d ,",
    "the reduction of the total electrostatic energy of the system is achieved by the localization of one electron every 1/@xmath5 site , where @xmath5 is the average number of electron per molecular site ; @xmath5 = 1/2 for a quarter - filled system .",
    "this localization wave corresponds to the 4@xmath2 cdw observed in 1d systems ( 4@xmath2=1/@xmath5 in chain reciprocal wave vector unit ) .",
    "if the system is metallic above the co critical temperature ( @xmath6 ) , and if @xmath5 is commensurate , the charge localization achieved at co transition will be then accompanied by a metal - insulator ( mi ) transition .",
    "this situation is , for example , achieved in ( tmttf)@xmath0sbf@xmath1 at @xmath7 @xmath8 154k @xcite ( see curve 2 in fig.7 ) . in quarter - filled systems , due to the spin - charge decoupling , the spin - degrees of freedom of the localized electrons remain active below @xmath6 . at lower temperatures ( @xmath9 ) , magnetic driven transitions such as spin - peierls ( sp ) or antiferromagnetic",
    "ordering can take place .",
    "the electronic counterpart of the co transition has been studied using the extended hubbard model @xcite .",
    "the extended hubbard - hamiltonian written in second - quantization notation , is given by :    @xmath10    where @xmath3 is the hopping term from site @xmath11 to site @xmath12 in the lattice , @xmath13 is the creation operator , which creates an electron on site @xmath11 with spin @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the correspondent annihilation operator ; @xmath16 is the on - site coulomb repulsion potential@xcite , @xmath17 and @xmath18 refer to the number operator for spin up and down , respectively , i.e.  @xmath19 ; and in the last term @xmath20 = @xmath17 @xmath21 @xmath18 .    already in 1978",
    "hubbard@xcite by using the hamiltonian ( 2 ) without kinetic energy ( @xmath22 = 0 ) and in absence of double site occupancy ( @xmath16 equal to infinity ) was able to discuss wigner crystals , i.e. 4@xmath2 cdw or co for @xmath5 between 1 and 1/2 .",

    ", the 4@xmath2 cdw or co achieves a periodicity of twice the distance between the tmttf molecules along the chain direction , i.e.  charge - rich sites alternate with charge - poor sites in a 1010 pattern , where 1 and 0 refer to charge - rich and charge - poor sites , respectively ( see fig.[cov ] ( a ) ) . to be complete , let us remark that a concave repulsive potential @xmath4 between the charges stabilizes the 11001100 charge pattern referred to as a 2@xmath2 cdw or paired electronic crystal ( pec ) in the literature ( see fig.[cov ] ( b ) ) .",
    "cdw or co , ( b ) 2@xmath2 cdw or pec , ( c ) 4@xmath2 bow or md @xcite , ( d ) 2@xmath2 bcdw and ( e ) 4@xmath2 cdw - sp .",

    "all the sites are equi - spaced . note",
    "that these ground states present different inversion symmetry except ( b ) and ( d ) which have the same symmetry.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    when there are finite on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath16 and inter - site hopping @xmath22 , a very rich phase diagram is obtained because for @xmath22 larger than the coulomb repulsions the system is metallic ( luttinger liquid ) . with long - range coulomb repulsions restricted to first neighboring sites ( @xmath26 = 1 ) , exact numerical calculations @xcite show that the quarter - filled system undergoes a mi transition achieving the co ground state shown in fig.[cov ] ( a ) if @xmath27(= @xmath28 in fig.[pd - co ] ) exceeds a critical value , @xmath29 ( see fig.[pd - co ] ) .",

    "the electron - phonon coupling@xcite show that in reality the co phase compete with additional ground states exhibiting considerably smaller difference in the charge densities of the charge - rich and charge - poor sites .",
    "some of them superimpose 2@xmath2 bow or sp distortions at the pec and co ground states previously considered , leading to so - called 2@xmath2 bcdw or tetramerized pec ( fig.[cov ] ( d ) ) and 4@xmath2 cdw - sp ( fig.[cov ] ( e ) ) modulations .    for the ( tmttf)@xmath0x salts , where the stack are already dimerized in the metallic phase , a modified extended hubbard model has been employed ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) . in this case ,",

    "the phase diagram of this hamiltonian is compared in fig.[pd - co ] to the one previously obtained for the uniform quarter - filled repulsive chain .",
    "the dimerization of the chain creates favorable conditions for a 4@xmath2 bow charge localization ( mott insulator ) .",
    "as this latter has a different inversion symmetry as the co , this destabilizes the 4@xmath2 cdw instability and thus enhance the critical @xmath29 necessary to achieve the co ground state @xcite . in the fabre salts , because of the incipient stack dimerization a 4@xmath2 bow progressive charge localization is generally observed at a crossover temperature @xmath35 larger than the critical temperature @xmath6 achieving the co ( see section iv ) .",
    "figure 1 shows various @xmath36 = 0k intra - chain charge configuration resulting from the minimization of various models of the 1d interacting electron gas .",
    "the experimentally relevant 3d ground state must be stabilized by inter - chain coupling .",
    "such inter - chain coupling involves coulomb coupling between charges sitting on neighboring chains or effective interactions between charges mediated by lattice deformations .",
    "the effect of inter - chain coulomb coupling has been recently considered in the fabre salts @xcite .",
    "the consideration of the lattice degrees of freedom requires the inclusion of electron - phonon coupling terms in the hamiltonian as done , for example , in ref.@xcite .",
    "the stabilization of the various charge modulation patterns shown in fiq.1 requires a coupling to the intra - molecular lattice modes or to the anions ( see ref.@xcite ) , while the various bond distance modulation patterns require a coupling to the inter - molecular lattice modes ( these aspects are briefly reviewed in ref.@xcite ) . in the fabre salts both charge modulation and stack deformation ( this latter leading to a deformation of the cavity where the anion is located ) will be coupled to the anion position and orientation and thus transmitted to the lattice parameters via the large phononic grneisen parameter of the anion ( see section v ) .    concluding this section ,",
    "it is useful to mention that evidence for a co phase has been also reported in many quarter - filled organic compounds other than the fabre salts .",
    "for example , first evidences of a phase transition to a co state were found by means of infra - red ( ir ) spectroscopy in the quasi-2d conductor @xmath37-(bedt - ttf)@xmath0i@xmath38 @xcite , and via nmr studies in the quasi-1d conductor ( di - dcnqi)@xmath0ag @xcite .    ,",

    "the 4k structural refinements of ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 @xcite and ( tmttf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 @xcite show that each anion locks its orientation by establishing two short f - se contact distances and four f ... h - ch@xmath0 bonds with four neighboring tmtcf molecules located nearly in a plane perpendicular to _ a_. in ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 , a cooperative locking between anions and methyl groups occurs at @xmath36 @xmath47 55k @xcite via the formation of h bonds between these two entities .",

    "the anion shift could present the same type of kinetic at the co transition as the anion orientation at the ao transition .",
    "the order - disorder dynamics could be related to the presence inside each methyl group cavity where the anion is located , of a multi - well potential provided by the donor surrounding and whose minima reflect the tendency for each anion to form local bonds with the donors .    from the theoretical point of view , using the extended hubbard model coupled to the lattice , riera and poiblanc @xcite propose that co could be due to a cooperative effect between the inter - site coulomb interaction @xmath28 and the coupling of charges located on the tmttf with the anions . in their model , the uniform displacement of the anions , which induce local modulation of the on - site electronic energy , are necessary to stabilize the co phase .    concluding this section , it is useful to recall that according to the model proposed by riera and poiblanc @xcite , and to the arguments discussed previously , anion displacement seems to play a crucial role in the stabilization of the co pattern .",

    "strictly speaking , the lattice grneisen parameter is a measure of the volume dependence of the anharmonicity of the lattice vibrations , which in turn is responsible for the lattice contribution to the thermal expansion in a solid . if the vibrational free energy , entropy , specific heat and thermal expansion are the sum of contributions @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath73 due to independent vibration modes of frequency @xmath110 , respectively , it is convenient to define the grneisen parameter of the phonon mode _",

    "this observation is complemented by a recent study @xcite of the thermal dependence of the lattice expansivity of ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 below 200k , which exhibits also high temperature negative contributions @xcite , and whose analysis shows that anion rotation exhibits a huge grneisen parameter of @xmath128(pf@xmath1 ) @xmath47 28 . a similar value of @xmath128(pf@xmath1 )",

    "the non - freezing of all the anion degrees of freedom at @xmath6 is sustained by the experimental observation that in the fabre salts incorporating tetrahedral anions , such as reo@xmath45 and bf@xmath45 ( whose orientation is disordered at rt ) , the co transition leaves unaffected the orientation degree of freedom of the anion which thus remains available for their ordering at an ao transition with a @xmath173 @xcite significantly lower than @xmath6 @xcite .    in the co process , however",

    "the off - centering anion displacements accompanying the co transition has been presented in ref.@xcite , as a direct consequence of the earnshaw s theorem , which states that a classical system of point charges under the interaction of coulomb forces alone is unstable , since there is no minimum in the electrostatic potential .",
    "this statement however requires many caution because if the shift of the anion induces some chemical bonding , with the methyl groups for example ( see the end of this section ) we are faced with a quantum phenomenon going beyond the validity of the earnshaw s theorem .",
    "the present findings ( see figs.[te - pf6 ] , [ te - asf6 ] and [ sbf6 ] ) provide strong evidence that the interstack _",

    "the resulting anion displacements , indicated by the arrows in fig.[fe-3d ] , which are uniform for all anions and lift the inversion symmetry , together with the minimization of coulomb energies of adjacent stacks along the @xmath185-axis determine the 3d charge pattern unambiguously .",
    "thus , the co transition achieving ferroelectricity requires a shift of the anions from the high temperature inversion centres .",

    "the two relevant configurations correspond to the two manners that the mf@xmath1 anion has to form f ... h bond with the neighboring methyl groups .",

    "disorder of the methyl groups will perturb the h bonding network with the anions .",
    "thus an opposite f ... h - ch@xmath0 linkage will invert the direction of the ferroelectric polarization and , since f ... h - bonds are directed towards the hole rich tmttf , this will induce a phase shift in the co pattern",

    "<S> charge - ordering phenomena have been highly topical over the last few years . a phase transition towards a charge ordered state has been observed experimentally in several classes of materials . among them , many studies have been devoted to the family of quasi - one dimensional organic charge - transfer salts ( tmttf)@xmath0x , where ( tmttf ) stands for tetramethyltetrathiafulvalene and x for a monovalent anion ( x = pf@xmath1 , asf@xmath1 and sbf@xmath1 ) . however , the relationship between the electron localization phenomena and the role of the lattice distortion in stabilizing the charge - ordering pattern is poorly documented in the literature . here </S>",
    "<S> we present a brief overview of selected literature results with emphasis placed on recent thermal expansion experiments probing the charge - ordering transition of these salts . </S>"
