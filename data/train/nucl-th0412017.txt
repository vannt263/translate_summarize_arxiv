    "during the past years , constituent quark models have been used successfully to calculate spectra and properties of hadrons .",
    "in the course of the developement of these models , relativity has emerged as a key ingredient in the light - quark sector .",
    "this has found early consideration ; e.g.  in the well - known works of godfrey and isgur @xcite and capstick and isgur @xcite , where relativistic corrections were introduced in a nonrelativistic potential model ; feynman _ et al . _",
    "@xcite based their model on a relativistic harmonic oscillator ; carlson _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used relativistic kinetic energies plus flux - tube motivated potential terms . in the particular case of the goldstone - boson - exchange ( gbe ) constituent - quark model ( cqm ) @xcite the early nonrelativistic formulation @xcite showed severe inconsistencies and was soon superseded by a `` semirelativistic '' version @xcite . in the semirelativistic treatment",
    "the hamiltonian of the model contains the relativistic kinetic energy plus potential terms , and it can in fact be reinterpreted as the mass operator of a poincar invariant model as long as the potential terms are rotationally invariant and do not depend on the total momentum of the bound state @xcite . in this form",
    "the gbe cqm has been applied to spectroscopy of the light and strange baryon sector with wide success ; however , an analogous calculation for mesons seemed to indicate failure of the model in this sector @xcite .",
    "only recently @xcite a poincar invariant coupled - channel ( cc ) formalism for confined two - particle systems interacting via one - particle exchange has been shown to elucidate the relevance and applicability of the gbe cqm for vector mesons .    aside from spectroscopy the semirelativistic gbe cqm has also been used to determine hadronic decay widths of baryons using perturbative calculations employing elementary emission @xcite ( without introducing additional parameters ) and also pair creation ( one additional parameter ) models @xcite . at that stage",
    "a satisfactory description of experimental data was impossible .",
    "a relativistic treatment of hadronic decays in an elementary - emission - type model seemed natural @xcite and recently a poincar invariant decay model along the point - form spectator approximation has been suggested @xcite .",
    "it was observed that , in general , the theoretical results considerably underestimated the experimental data . in the light of these results",
    "the next natural step is to couple the decay channels explicitly to the @xmath1 ( for baryons ) and @xmath2 ( for mesons ) channels , respectively . in @xcite",
    "a study of vector mesons has been done to investigate the effects of such a dynamical treatment of the exchange particle in the gbe in a poincar invariant framework both in terms of mass shifts _ and _ decay widths .",
    "the semirelativistic form of the model produces a much too large mass splitting of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this flaw is removed in the cc treatment , leading to small mass shifts from the gbe in vector mesons , which confirmes the expectation that this type of interaction should not contribute much to the binding of such states .",
    "regarding hadronic decays , the situation is difficult to judge with regard to comparison with experimental data , since for only one branching ratio , which can be calculated in the model @xcite , there is actually available data @xcite . in the present work",
    "we follow ref .",
    "@xcite , which contains the details of all aspects of the formalism and model used here , applying those to axial - vector mesons with quantum numbers @xmath5 and @xmath6 as well as the strange sector via mixing of the states with the respective quantum numbers .",
    "the results identify dynamical effects for @xmath0 and enable the calculation of more hadronic decay widths within the restrictions of the states contained in the model .",
    "we briefly review the main ingredients of the model in sec .  [ model ] ,",
    "the results are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "[ results ] , and sec .  [ conclusions ]",
    "contains conclusions .",
    "the central point of the cc treatment described in @xcite is the cc mass operator , which is defined on the little hilbert space of the direct sum of @xmath7 ( quark - antiquark ) and @xmath8 ( quark - antiquark - pseudoscalar meson ) : @xmath9 here @xmath10 represents the diagonal part of @xmath11 , which includes the confinement interaction such that in both the @xmath2 and @xmath12 channels the @xmath2 pair is confined .",
    "@xmath13 contains a vertex piece @xmath14 and its hermitian adjoint as defined in eqs .",
    "( 31 ) and ( 32 ) of @xcite .",
    "when the eigenvalue equation for @xmath11 is reduced to the @xmath2 channel , one obtains the effective interaction term on the right - hand side of @xmath15 in this equation , @xmath16 is the eigenvalue and appears also in the effective interaction term .",
    "we note here that the interaction contains terms which correspond to the exchange of a pseudoscalar meson @xmath17 inside the @xmath2 pair and others , in which the pseudoscalar meson @xmath17 couples to the same constituent twice .",
    "we will refer to the latter as `` loop terms '' .",
    "the particular form and choices for the operators in eq .",
    "( [ theeq ] ) and their matrix elements are described in detail in the appendix of @xcite . extending the model with the parameters established in the vector - meson sector to the axial vectors , the question for the need for readjustment of some of the parameters arises .",
    "already for the vector - meson calculation , the parameters used in the exchange part of the interaction were taken without change from the semirelativistic gbe cqm in @xcite and we have kept them the same here as well .",
    "this includes the definition and parameters of the quark - meson vertex form factors which determine the range of the @xmath17 exchange . for the confinement piece , a harmonic oscillator ( ho ) model was used in @xmath18 for two reaons : first",
    ", the ho mass operator s eigenvalues and eigensolutions are analytically known , which facilitates the calculations and second , it mimicks the spectrum of a linear confinement potential for @xmath11 .",
    "the actual form used in @xcite is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is determined by the constituent quark masses , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the radial and orbital angular momentum quantum numbers , respectively .",
    "@xmath23 is the confinement strength and @xmath24 a constant used to fix the mass of the @xmath3 ground state to its physical value .",
    "@xmath23 was adjusted such that the splitting of the @xmath3 ground and first excited states was reproduced .",
    "it should be noted here that this is not the best possible choice for @xmath25 in terms of an accurate fit to experimental data for higher excited states .",
    "however , the main emphasis of our studies still lies on the effects of a dynamical treatment of the one - particle exchange as compared to an instantaneous approximation ( ia ) .",
    "therefore @xmath25 is sufficient for the present purpose . in principle",
    "one could choose any confinement operator , which is diagonal in the basis of eq .",
    "( [ theeq ] ) , satisfies the ( in our case point - form ) bakamjian - thomas requirements @xcite , and whose solutions are known and can therefore be used to discretize the problem .    in an attempt to extend the basic ho piece of the model beyond the vector - meson sector one can use the concept of regge trajectories @xcite",
    "this approach has already been used in @xcite and recently in the context of relativistic hamiltonian dynamics @xcite .",
    "if one uses such a trajectory , which contains the @xmath3 ground state , to determine the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 , one finds that the parameter set established for the vector mesons does not need to be changed .",
    "the parameters used in all calculations presented here are thus @xmath26   and @xmath27 .",
    "this completes the summary of the model definitions .    in the calculations we make two approximations",
    "first , we do not treat the loop contributions in the effective interaction explicitly .",
    "this is motivated by the assumption that their effects can be accounted for via a change in the constituent - quark mass .",
    "an explicit treatment of these terms is an extension of the model which will be incorporated in future studies .",
    "second , some of the matrix elements occurring in eq .",
    "( [ theeq ] ) contain wigner rotations , which come from the overlap of the various sets of basis states used in the computation of the effective interaction ( see eq .",
    "( a16 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "we neglect these rotations , because , while the numerical effort to include them is considerable , their effects have been found to be small compared to boost effects in calculations of electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon @xcite .",
    "we have obtained results for the axial - vector states with quantum numbers @xmath5 and @xmath6 by solving the eigenvalue equation for @xmath11 numerically . for quark - model mesons",
    "one has the relations @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath22 is the orbital angular momentum and @xmath30 the total spin of the constituents , respectively ; for @xmath5 this entails @xmath31 , @xmath0 ; the physical states corresponding to this set of quantum numbers are the @xmath32 ( with isospin @xmath33 ) , @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) . for @xmath6",
    "one gets @xmath38 , @xmath0 with the associated particles @xmath39 ( @xmath33 ) , @xmath40 ( @xmath35 ) , and @xmath41 ( @xmath37 ) . within the isospin 0 channels we assume ideal mixing between the octet and singlet @xmath42-flavor configurations , meaning that the @xmath39 as well as the @xmath32 spectra each contain both pure @xmath43 and @xmath44 states ( in the usual notation , @xmath21 here denotes light quarks ) . in the strange sector , the physical states of the @xmath45 spectrum are mixtures of the @xmath36 and @xmath41 , since they are not charge - parity eigenstates . in our treatment of this mixing",
    "we follow blundell _ et al .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] in six `` columns '' for each set of quantum numbers ; the experimental values @xcite are depicted in the first column ( denoted by the particle names ) by boxes indicating the experimental uncertainties ; the second to sixth columns contain results for pure oscillator ( o ) , coupled channel calculation with vertex form factor ( cf ) , cc calculation with the form factor set = 1 ( c1 ) , an instantaneous approximation with vertex form factor ( if ) , and the ia calculation with the form factor set = 1 ( i1 ) .",
    "these are the same categories as presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ; also see this reference for details .    in the vector - meson sector",
    "@xcite the @xmath2 states have mainly orbital angular momentum @xmath46 with small admixtures of @xmath47 .",
    "there the main observation was that generally the cc treatment produces smaller mass shifts than the ia , including the prominent case of the @xmath4 ground state .",
    "for axial - vector mesons one always has @xmath0 and the observations about mass shifts are different , except that the main differences between cc treatment and ia can be found in the isoscalar channels ; this is not surprising , because one - pion exchange is strongest in these channels and the light mass of the exchange particle plays a central role in the dynamical setup .    in general the dependence of the mass shifts on the use of a form factor at the quark - meson vertex is smaller in the cc treament than in the ia .",
    "this is true in particular for the case of the @xmath39 meson , where for the ia the shifts with and without the form factor have opposite sign . for the @xmath40 ,",
    "a different sign change appears : while the cc shifts are positive , the ia ones are negative ( although in both cases the shifts are small ) . in the @xmath32 spectrum , one observes that mass shifts using the form factor are larger for the cc than the ia results and the same seems to apply to the results without the form factor except for the first @xmath44 state .",
    "this is opposite to the general observation for vector mesons .",
    "the reason for these variety of effects lies in the complexity of the dynamical setup for the cc formalism in connection with the wave functions for @xmath0 states . on different ranges of the relative momentum between the @xmath48 and the @xmath49 , these can have support of different sign , which gets modified in addition via the kinematical relations used in the calculation as apparent from eq .",
    "( a16 ) in @xcite .",
    "the results for the decay widths are larger than in the vector - meson case .",
    "however , similarly to the latter there is only one branching ratio in @xcite which we can compare our results to , although most of the decays are regarded as `` seen '' .",
    "our results are generally of the order of @xmath50 to @xmath51 .",
    "the known branching ratio is that of the @xmath52 with @xmath53 , which decays dominantly into channels contained in our model ; our result is 33  with and 42  without the form factor , underestimating experiment by about a factor of 4 .",
    "we have applied the poincar invariant coupled - channel ( cc ) formalism of ref.@xcite to the sector of axial - vector mesons .",
    "the axial - vector quantum numbers @xmath54 both imply orbital angular momentum @xmath0 for the @xmath2 pair .",
    "the effects of the dynamical treatment of the one - boson exchange ( obe ) as compared to the instantaneous approximation ( ia ) reveals different characteristics as compared to the case of vector mesons ( mainly @xmath46 ) .",
    "there are four main observations : i ) as for the vector mesons , the effects are strongest in the isoscalar channels , since there one - pion exchange dominates , which is very sensitive to the dynamical setup due to the light pion mass .",
    "ii ) in the @xmath39 spectrum the use of a vertex form factor ( as compared to a form factor = 1 ) changes the sign of the mass shift from the meson exchange in the ia , while the cc results have the same sign and magnitude regardless of the details of the form factor .",
    "iii ) in the @xmath32 spectrum the cc mass shifts are larger than the ia ones - opposite to the general trend ( including the vector mesons ) .",
    "iv ) in the @xmath34 spectrum the cc shifts have the opposite sign as compared to the ia ones .",
    "the main conclusion from this collection of observations must be that results from a dynamical cc treatment of one - particle exchange can differ significantly , both in magnitude and sign , in channels where this exchange is important .",
    "the results for the decay widths are sizable , but comparison with experimental data is inconclusive : the only data point with definite value ( for the @xmath52 ) is underestimated by a factor of 4 .",
    "this supports the conclusion drawn in @xcite from an analogous situation in the @xmath55 case : the calculations could be improved by explicitly including the loop contributions from the interaction in eq .",
    "( [ theeq ] ) and/or taking into account final - state interactions .",
    "these conclusions strongly suggest analogous investigations of @xmath1 systems in this context , since such a dynamical , poincar invariant treatment of obe in the baryon sector is yet missing . in @xcite and the present work the path is laid out and also a possible intermediate step has been identified @xcite .",
    "we note here that a treatment along the lines of the stochastic variational method @xcite used up to date in the gbe cqm @xcite seems impossible due to the high dimensions and numerical nature of the integrations involved in the solution of the cc problem .",
    "a more promising approach is of faddeev type along the lines of ref .",
    "it is important to proceed in this direction , because : a dynamical treatment of the obe in baryons will yield hadronic baryon decay widths in a nonperturbative way , which could remedy their unsatisfactory description at the present stage of the model .",
    "furthermore , given the limited comparison to experimental data of hadronic meson decays predicted by the present work and in ref.@xcite as well as the importance of gbe in the baryon sector , an analogous investigation of baryons will make the full impact of a dynamical treatment of obe - type interactions clear .",
