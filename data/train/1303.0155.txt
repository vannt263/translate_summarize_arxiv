    "in order to model problems involving conflicts among individuals von neumann and morgenstern @xcite introduced the mathematical concept of games .",
    "these ideas found applications in several fields of science , from economics to social sciences and reached the quantum domain back in 1999 , when meyer @xcite and eisert , wilkens and lewenstein @xcite elaborated quantum versions of a coin - flip game and of the prisoner dilemma ( pd ) , respectively .",
    "the classical pd game is the keystone for modelling cooperative behaviour between animals , economic agents , strategies for iterated games @xcite and even some rna virus@xcite .",
    "quantum mechanics can solve such dilemma , as were shown in reference @xcite , if one player could use a quantum strategy  quantum in the sense of an strategy that is not cooperate nor defect .",
    "experimentally the pd was realized using nmr by du and co - workers @xcite and recently using optical techniques by pinheiro _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "several papers followed these two seminal works , we can mention monty - hall problem @xcite , discoordination games @xcite , repeated quantum games @xcite , multiplayer quantum games @xcite , quantum auctions @xcite , quantum dating market @xcite and minority game both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "game theory can model also not only cooperative behaviour but conflict situations .",
    "this is the case of the so - called quantum duel studied by flitney and abbott @xcite and revisited by schmidt and paiva @xcite . in this game",
    "each player , alice and bob for instance , has a qubit @xmath0 where @xmath1 represents the `` alive '' state and @xmath1 the `` dead '' state , and their only objective is to flip his / hers opponent s spin .",
    "following this idea schmidt and da silva proposed the quantum version of the gamble known as russian roulette , where players shoot themselves at point blank range using a gun loaded with just one bullet @xcite .",
    "the authors found some interesting results concerning the cases where the gun was fully loaded as well as when there was just one quantum bullet inside its chambers .",
    "however , in the case of 3-person game , one can find only sketch of a possible form of the scheme rather than the exact protocol .",
    "the framework , however , can lead to quite different models , and some of them inconsistent with the 2-person quantum roulette .",
    "the previous analysis suggests a possibility of studying the game with larger number of players as the authors construct some particular case of quantum description of the 3-person .",
    "our research is aimed at showing that there exists a natural extension of the two - person quantum russian roulette to the @xmath2-person case .",
    "a formal theory for quantum games was initiated with the concepts of quantum matrix games @xcite .",
    "however , quantum methods have found application in many other types of games and decision problems from then on .",
    "apart from the quantum scheme for extensive games @xcite one can find such quantized problems as the quantum monty hall problem @xcite and the quantum roulette @xcite .",
    "the essential for our studying are ones concerning quantum duels and truels @xcite .",
    "it was shown in paper @xcite that the schemes for quantum duels and truels can be adapted quantum russian roulette where the authors provide us with the concept for two and three - person case .",
    "the outline for our paper is the following : in section  [ twopersonroulette ] we review the two - person quantum russian roulette .",
    "section  [ nroulette ] is devoted to present the generalized operators for the @xmath3person case and to discuss some illustrative examples . in the final section",
    "we conclude the work .",
    "according to @xcite the scheme for 2-person quantum russian roulette is described as follows : each player has a qubit and the game is played in a hilbert space @xmath4 .",
    "the game begins with both players alive , namely @xmath5-th player for @xmath6 .",
    "the referee prepares operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( the operators are also labelled @xmath9 if the angle that the operator depends on is relevant ) , @xmath10\\langle 11|\\\\ & \\quad+[e^{i\\alpha}\\sin(\\gamma/2)|01\\rangle + ie^{-i\\beta}\\cos(\\gamma/2)|11\\rangle ] \\langle 01| +    o_{2}&= [ e^{-i\\alpha}\\sin(\\gamma/2)|11\\rangle + ie^{i\\beta}\\cos(\\gamma/2)|10\\rangle]\\langle 11|\\\\ & \\quad+[e^{i\\alpha}\\sin(\\gamma/2)|10\\rangle + ie^{-i\\beta}\\cos(\\gamma/2)|11\\rangle ] \\langle 10| + |00\\rangle \\langle 00| + |01\\rangle \\langle 01|.\\end{aligned}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which the first and the second player act on the initial state .",
    "the game proceeds in rounds ( the referee is allowed to settle any number of rounds ) .",
    "the state after @xmath11 rounds , @xmath12 is defined recursively , @xmath13 and the outcome after @xmath14th round is given by a measurement with respect to the computational basis , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the outcome corresponding to the measured state @xmath17 . in particular ,",
    "the measurement can be identified with a payoff function .",
    "for example , in @xcite , the authors studied the quantum russian roulette with payoff functions @xmath18;\\\\ & \\langle \\mathdollar_{2 } \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[1 + |\\langle 01|\\psi_{m}\\rangle|^2 - |\\langle 10|\\psi_{m}\\rangle|^2-|\\langle 00|\\psi_{m}\\rangle|^2\\right ] .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which means that each of the players wins 1 if he is only one who survived and 1/2 if both players are alive .",
    "otherwise , they win nothing .",
    "note that , other payoff functions can be defined as well .",
    "for example , the case that a player receives payoff 1 only when he is the only survivor and the other player ` receives ' -1 is equally natural , especially with reference to the classical game , where the draw is not normally possible , i.e , @xmath19 scheme ( [ operatoryschmidta])-([generalpayoff ] ) generalizes the classical 2-person russian roulette with a gun having two chambers in the barrel .",
    "indeed , let us assume that @xmath20 represents a bullet in the player  @xmath21 s chamber and @xmath22 means that @xmath21-th chamber is empty .",
    "then a result corresponding to each of four possible cases in the classical game , that is , when the barrel of the gun is full , a bullet is in the first or the second chamber and the barrel is empty , can be reconstructed with the results of scheme ( [ operatoryschmidta])-([generalpayoff ] ) for @xmath23 . from ( [ rekurencyjna ] )",
    "we have @xmath24 thus , if the states @xmath25 and @xmath1 are assumed to represent _ dead _ and _ alive _ state , respectively , the measurement outcome of each of the resulting states  ( [ 2resultingstates ] ) identifies with the classical results .",
    "for example , if the bullet is inside the second player s chamber , the game ends with the death of the second player . in the quantum case",
    "it means that operators ( [ operatoryschmidta ] ) are prepared with @xmath26 , and the measurement on @xmath27 outputs @xmath28 .",
    "it worth noting that , in general , scheme ( [ operatoryschmidta])-([generalpayoff ] ) takes into consideration the case in which a bullet in each chamber @xmath21 may be found with some probability @xmath29 .",
    "indeed , the final state associated with the general form of operators ( [ operatoryschmidta ] ) takes on the form @xmath30 the result given by the measurement ( [ generalpayoff ] ) on state ( [ oostate ] ) coincides with the classical result if we assume @xmath31 .",
    "for example , the case where the first player is alive and the second player fails at the end of the first round takes place with probability @xmath32 , and the quantum counterpart @xmath28 is measured with probability @xmath33 .",
    "now , we extend scheme ( [ operatoryschmidta])-([generalpayoff ] ) to consider the game with more than two players .",
    "we stick to the russion roulette in which the referee prepares the gun with one chamber for each player , and a player finds a bullet in his own chamber with some probability .",
    "the previous section shows that the proper definition of 2-person quantum russian roulette lies in a construction of suitable operators ( [ operatoryschmidta ] ) .",
    "now , we use the same reasoning for the @xmath2-person game .",
    "let us denote by @xmath34 and @xmath35 the unitary operators on @xmath36 given by formulae @xmath37 then operators ( [ operatoryschmidta ] ) can be written as follows : @xmath38 the first term of each @xmath39 leaves the state unchanged if both players are initially dead @xmath40 or only player @xmath21 is alive @xmath41 .",
    "otherwise , the second term performs unitary operation on player @xmath21 s qubit leaving the opponent s qubit unchanged .",
    "it can be done the same in @xmath2-person case .",
    "that is , player @xmath21 s operator @xmath39 does nothing if either only player @xmath21 is alive or all the players are dead , and @xmath39 performs unitary transformation only on player @xmath21 s qubit .",
    "[ defnperson ] an @xmath2-person quantum russian roulette with @xmath42 rounds is defined by the following components :    * the players operators @xmath43 * the final state @xmath44 at @xmath14th round , @xmath45 , @xmath46 * the measurement after @xmath11 round , @xmath47    the clear way of describing ( [ trzyoperators ] ) allows us to easily prove that    operators defined by ( [ trzyoperators ] ) are unitary .    without loss of generality",
    "we prove that @xmath7 is a unitary on @xmath48 .",
    "since @xmath34 and @xmath49 are unitary operators we obtain @xmath50 but @xmath51 which implies that @xmath52 .",
    "the scheme defined by ( [ trzyoperators])-([fmeasurement ] ) generalizes a russian roulette in a similar way as scheme ( [ operatoryschmidta])-([generalpayoff ] ) does .",
    "@xmath53    like in the case of quantum duels and truels , if @xmath54 , it is not possible to obtain superior results in the quantum russian roulette playing only one round . however , if the game is played two or more rounds ( without measuring state @xmath44 before the last round is played ) , the results in the quantum game can differ significantly from the corresponding results in the classical game .    @xmath55    * table 1 * probabilities for all players being alive after the second round when parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 as well as angles @xmath58 are uniformly distributed .",
