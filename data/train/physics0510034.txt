    "given the dependence of the cyclotron frequency on mass , @xmath14 , the spiral time for a muon is nine time less than for a @xmath10 . the gas pressure in the center must be low , both to allow a particle to spiral all the way in before stopping , and to allow reasonable kicker voltages for axial extraction . an 80 ns electric kicker pulse rising to 500 v / cm in 20 ns is employed . the @xmath10 s move 32 cm in 500 ns .",
