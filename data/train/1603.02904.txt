    "in recent years liquid noble gases , such as liquid xenon ( lxe ) or liquid argon ( lar ) , have been increasingly used for particle detectors .",
    "many sensitive searches for dark matter particles , axions , and particles beyond the standard model were conducted using such lxe and lar detectors @xcite .",
    "these studies require a sufficient understanding of detector response from @xmath6o(100)kev down to the detector threshold caused by nuclear and electron recoils .",
    "in particular , an energy calibration and evaluation of vertex reconstruction of the detector are an important means to interpreting experimental results .",
    "to evaluate the energy response of a detector , neutron sources and small accelerators are commonly used for nuclear recoil events , whereas the direct introduction of radio - active sources ( e.g.,@xmath7kr and tritiated ethane ) into detectors is typically performed via electron recoil events .",
    "conversely , methods for evaluating reconstruction performance of vertex determination for low - energy events region are not well - established , because true vertices of diffused radioactive decay are not given independently . to overcome this problem , kim el al .",
    "proposed the use of low - energy events whose event vertices are accurately determined by accompanying higher - energy events @xcite . in this paper , we report on the development of a calibration source based on @xmath0rn for liquid - noble - gas detectors . + here",
    ", @xmath0rn is one of the isotopes of rn located at the middle of the thorium series .",
    "there are several advantages of using @xmath0rn calibration as a source , including the following :    1 .",
    "presence of @xmath1bi@xmath1po consecutive decays with short life time of @xmath1po ( i.e. , @xmath8 = 299 ns ) + both @xmath1bi and @xmath1po are daughter nuclei of @xmath0rn and provide @xmath9-@xmath2 consecutive decays . since the lifetime of @xmath1po is short , the difference between decay vertices of @xmath1po and @xmath1bi is negligible , though they freely move in a liquid medium .",
    "further , @xmath1po provide an accurate determination of the decay vertex by reconstruction because of a large number of scintillation photons . thus enabling us to use the difference of reconstructed vertices of low - energy @xmath9 and @xmath2-rays to evaluate the performance of reconstruction at low energy . since they are expected to uniformly distribute in the detector ,",
    "an elevation of position dependence of vertex resolution is possible as well .",
    "no long - life radioactivity downstream of @xmath0rn + the second advantage is that there are no long - life radioisotopes downstream of @xmath0rn .",
    "because of this , radioactivity that is introduced can decay out rather quickly .",
    "though @xmath1bi and @xmath1po in a uranium chain also cause consecutive decays with a half - life of 164 @xmath10s , decaying out of all radioactivity takes a longer amount of time ; more specifically , @xmath3rn and @xmath4pb have half - lives of 3.8 days and 20 years , respectively , which is undesirable since it will cause an increase in background levels .",
    "existence of @xmath0rn as a noble gas + the third advantage is that @xmath0rn is a noble gas , which is useful for suppressing other impurities since @xmath0rn can go through a hot metal getter typically used to purify a noble gas . here",
    ", the getter removes impurities such as o@xmath11 , h@xmath11o , and oily molecules that may impact the performance of the detector .",
    "we first note that there are publicly available thorium sources . in our calibration system , we used 50 pieces of lantern mantle containing thorium , as shown in fig .",
    "[ lm ] , captain stag m-7911 .",
    "thorium is useful for generating strong light .",
    "direct measurements using a ge detector show @xmath0rn activity with 1.2 kbq per one piece of lantern mantle . emanating gas from some of these pieces of lantern mantle was measured and found to contain @xmath630 bq of @xmath0rn per one piece when in radioactive - decay equilibrium .",
    "the key issue to introduce @xmath0rn is its short half - life of 56 s. for our system , we used a small lxe chamber located in the kamioka mine .",
    "its inner cylindrical chamber was filled by lxe while its outer chamber was used for vacuum insulation .",
    "the detector used 1.7 kg lxe and two photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) hamamatsu r10789 ; the pmts were set face - to - face using an aluminum holder and a polytetrafluoroethylene ( ptfe ) cylinder , as illustrated in fig .  [ xeline ] .",
    "the detector was connected to a large xe gas bottle containing @xmath66 kg of xenon gas , with xenon introduced into the chamber from the bottle .",
    "the gaseous xenon were liquefied and refrigerated using temperature feedback ; here , its cold head was located above the top of the pmts .    a container with a thorium source emanating @xmath0rn was then connected between the gas bottle and lxe chamber .",
    "the diameter of the source container was 4 cm , and its length was 40 cm ; the container had a volume of 502 @xmath12 .",
    "the 50 pieces of lantern mantle were kept in the source container . to introduce @xmath0rn gas , xenon gas from the gas bottle",
    "was used as the carrier .",
    "the xenon carrier gas introduced the emanated @xmath0rn gas into the detector through a getter . here ,",
    "the getter was necessary to remove impurities from the pieces of lantern mantle .",
    "at the cold head , the mixture of carrier gas and @xmath0rn gas was liquefied . to avoid a sudden change of pressure or temperature of the detector ,",
    "the flow rate of the gas mixture was set to two liters per minute and maintained for two min . in total , four liters of xenon carrier gas were introduced with @xmath0rn .",
    "this quick operation is important for realizing the successful introduction of @xmath0rn .",
    "the detector was equipped with a flash analog - to - digital converter ( fadc ) with 1 ns sampling and a 1 v dynamic range . the output of the two pmts was amplified and fed into the fadc .",
    "another output of the amplified signal was used to make a coincidence signal to trigger data acquisition .",
    "the discrimination for each pmt signal was @xmath630 kev , and coincidence was issued when two discriminator signals existed within 150 ns of each other .    to calibrate an energy scale of the detector and monitor its stability , we used a @xmath13cs external @xmath14-ray source .",
    "this source was located at the bottom of the detector , outside of the outer chamber . because there is position dependence of the light yield in the inner chamber ,",
    "events happening around the center were extracted based on the balance of observed photoelectrons from the two pmts to form a photoelectric peak caused by 667 kev @xmath14-rays , as shown in fig .",
    "[ cscalib1 ] .",
    "the peak was then fitted by gaussian and linear functions , as shown in fig .",
    "[ cscalib2 ] , and the light yield was evaluated as the mean of the gaussian .",

    "after introducing four liters of carrier xenon gas with @xmath0rn from the source , data collection was conducted for 61 h. the first hour of data was found to be useless because the recorded fadc range was not appropriate and rejected .",
    "to identify @xmath1bi@xmath1po consecutive events , we required the following two conditions : ( 1 ) the peak with the maximum height in a waveform must be alpha - like ; and ( 2 ) the events must have been triggered by another lower peak with the timing difference between the peak at the trigger position and peak position with the maximum height larger than 30 ns but smaller than 900 ns . condition ( 1 ) utilizes the fact that @xmath2 particles have a shorter decay constant of scintillation lights than that of @xmath9 and @xmath14-ray particles . to discriminate @xmath2 and @xmath9 / @xmath14 , the ratio between two integrated areas of the fadc waveform was used to provide a comparison .",
    "the ratio of the pulse shape discrimination ( psd ) parameter is defined as the blue area of fig .",
    "[ bipo_psd ] divided by the sum of the blue and red areas shown in the figure .",
    "the energy of an event was obtained by summing the area observed in waveforms from the top and bottom pmts , and calibration data was calculated via the @xmath13cs source , assuming linearity of the energy response .",
    "figure [ hpsd_bipo ] shows the psd parameter versus the observed energy . in the figure ,",
    "the events within the black box were selected as alpha - like events .",
    "condition ( 2 ) requires the presence of a peak at the trigger position that differs from the maximum peak identified as @xmath2-like .",
    "if the timing of the @xmath2-like peak is within the range of 30 to 900 ns after the trigger timing , it was selected as the final @xmath1bi@xmath1po consecutive events . as a result of our analysis here",
    ", we found 292 events in our data over 60 h. the expected number of events due to chance coincidence was evaluated as 0.5 and was not subtracted .",
    "the black dots in fig .",

    "[ e_bipo ] shows the energy distribution of the @xmath2-ray events . from this data sample ,",
    "a distribution of the timing differences between @xmath1bi and @xmath1po was obtained and is shown in fig .",
    "[ bipo_po212 ] .",
    "the distribution was fitted by a single exponential function ; as a result of this fit , the decay constant of @xmath1po candidates was 297 @xmath15 34 ns , which is consistent with the expectation of 299 ns .",
    "therefore , this supports the claim that the observed consecutive events are due to @xmath1bi@xmath1po decays .",

    "there are two methods for evaluating the number of @xmath0rn atoms introduced .",
    "one method is based on the number of observed @xmath1bi@xmath1po consecutive events , while the other method is based on the number of @xmath2-rays due to @xmath0rn and @xmath16po just after the introduction of @xmath0rn .",

[ arate ] ) just after introduction of @xmath0rn , tagging each @xmath0rn and @xmath16po event was not possible , because the half - life of @xmath16po is 0.145 seconds ; however , @xmath2-like events were separated from @xmath9 and @xmath14-ray events using the difference of scintillation decay constants . as a result ,",
    "the number of observed @xmath2-like events was 1427 in 15 min after the injection of @xmath0rn .",
    "the number of expected background atoms was evaluated to be 26.5 using data after the first hour and should therefore be subtracted from the observed number of events .",
