    "for example , standing waves were studied on the tadpole graph ( a ring attached to a semi - infinite line ) @xcite .",
    "besides the standing waves supported in the ring that bifurcate from eigenvalues of the linear operators closed in the ring , the tadpole graph also admits the standing waves localized in the ring with the tails extended in the semi - infinite line .",
    "these standing waves bifurcate from the end - point resonance of the linear operators defined on the tadpole graph and include the positive solution , which is proved to be orbitally stable in the evolution of the cubic nls equation near the bifurcation point @xcite .",
    "the positive solution bifurcating from the end - point resonance bears the lowest energy at the fixed @xmath0 norm , called the ground state .",
    "other positive states on the tadpole graph also exist in parameter space far away from the end - point resonance but they do not bear smallest energy and they do not branch off the ground state @xcite .",
    "the present contribution is devoted to analysis of standing waves ( and the ground state ) on the dumbbell graph shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the dumbbell graph is represented by two rings ( with equal length normalized to @xmath2 ) connected by the central line segment ( with length @xmath3 ) . at the junctions between the rings and the central line segment , we apply the kirchhoff boundary conditions to define the coupling .",

    "no rigorous analysis of the nls equation ( [ nls ] ) on a compact graph has been developed .",
    "on the other hand , ground states on compact intervals subject to dirichlet or periodic boundary conditions have been considered in the literature @xcite .",

    ", one can anticipate that the ground state is a symmetric state distributed everywhere in the graph in the limit of small values of @xmath30 but it may become an asymmetric standing wave residing in just one ring as a result of a pitchfork bifurcation for larger values of @xmath30 .",
    "we show in this paper that this intuitive picture is only partially correct .",
    "we show that the ground state is indeed represented by a constant ( symmetric ) solution for small values of @xmath30 . for larger values of @xmath30 , the constant solution undertakes two instability bifurcations . at the first bifurcation associated with the anti - symmetric perturbation ,",

    "it is rather surprising that both the precedence of the symmetry - breaking bifurcation of the constant solution and the appearance of the symmetric wave as a ground state in the limit of large @xmath30 do not depend on the value of the length parameter @xmath31 relative to @xmath32 .",
    "our main result is formulated as the following two theorems .",
    "we also include numerical approximations of the standing waves of the stationary nls equation ( [ statnls ] ) in order to illustrate the main result .",
    "the numerical work relies on the petviashvili s and newton s iterative methods which are commonly used for approximation of standing waves of the nls equations @xcite .",

    "we also show numerically that these same positive waves are connected to the truncated solitary waves ( [ ground-2 ] ) and ( [ ground-3 ] ) as @xmath44 .",
    "see figures [ stat2 ] , [ stat3 ] , [ statcomp ] , and [ stat8 ] .",
    "we show in lemma [ lemma - limit ] that the energy difference between the truncated solitary wave localized in the central segment and the one localized in the ring is exponentially small as @xmath44 .",
    "nevertheless , it is only the former wave which appears to be the ground state of the constrained minimization problem ( [ minimizer ] ) as @xmath45 . in the numerical iterations of the petviashvili s and newton s methods ,",
    "both standing waves arise naturally when the initial data is concentrated either in a loop or in a central link .",
    "figures [ stat9 ] and [ stat10 ] illustrate that although the positive asymmetric wave is not a global constrained minimizer of energy , it is a local constrained minimizer , so that it is also orbitally stable in the time evolution of the cubic nls equation ( [ nls ] ) .",

    "<S> we consider standing waves in the focusing nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation on a dumbbell graph ( two rings attached to a central line segment subject to the kirchhoff boundary conditions at the junctions ) . in the limit of small @xmath0 norm , the ground state ( the orbitally stable standing wave of the smallest energy at a fixed @xmath0 norm ) is represented by a constant solution . </S>",
    "<S> however , when the @xmath0 norm is increased , this constant solution undertakes two bifurcations , where the first is the pitchfork ( symmetry breaking ) bifurcation and the second one is the symmetry preserving bifurcation . as a result of the first symmetry breaking bifurcation , the standing wave becomes more localized in one of the two rings . as a result of the second symmetry preserving bifurcation , </S>",
    "<S> the standing wave becomes localized in the central line segment . in the limit of large norm solutions , both standing waves are represented by a truncated solitary wave localized in either the ring or the central line segment . although the asymmetric wave supported in the ring is a ground state near the symmetry breaking bifurcation of the constant solution , it is the symmetric wave supported in the central line segment which becomes the ground state in the limit of large @xmath0 norm . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical results are confirmed by numerical approximations of the ground state on the dumbbell graph . </S>"
