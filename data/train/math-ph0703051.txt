    "the concept of quantum mechanics on a graph is more than half a century old having roots in modelling of aromatic hydrocarbons @xcite . for many years",
    ", however , it was rather a curiosity , or maybe an interesting textbook example .",
    "the situation changed two decades ago with the advent of microfabrication techniques which allow us to produce tiny graph - shaped structures of semiconductor and other materials for which this is a useful and versatile model .",
    "this motivated a new theoretical attention to the subject ",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite . since then the literature on quantum graphs grew to a formidable volume , and we restrict ourselves here to mentioning recent reviews in @xcite where an extensive bibliography can be found .    from the mathematical point of view",
    "the attractive feature of the model is that it deals with families of ordinary differential equations , the solutions of which have to be properly matched at the graph edge endpoints .",
    "since the solutions are often explicitly known , the spectral analysis can be reduced to an algebraic problem .",
    "the key point here are the boundary conditions through which the wave functions are matched .",
    "the hamiltonian is typically a second - order differential operator , for instance , in the simplest case of a free spinless particle it acts on the @xmath4-th edge as @xmath5 .",
    "thus the boundary conditions are linear relations coupling the values of the functions and their first derivatives at graph vertices ; from the physical point of view it is usually sufficient to consider only _ local _ couplings which involve values at a single vertex only .",
    "another general physical restriction is the self - adjointness of the hamiltonian ; it implies that a vertex joining @xmath0 graph edges may be characterized by boundary conditions involving @xmath6 real parameters @xcite .",
    "this leaves a considerable freedom in the choice of a model to describe particular physical systems , and an understanding of the physical meaning of vertex coupling is needed to pick the appropriate operator from the class of admissible hamiltonians . a natural way to approach",
    "this problem is through approximation , i.e. regarding the quantum graph in question as a limit of a family of more `` realistic '' systems with a less number of free parameters .",
    "one possibility is to approximate a graph by a family of `` fat graphs '' or similar manifolds equipped with the corresponding laplace - beltrami operators .",
    "the best studied case is the one where the approximated manifolds have neumann boundary , or no boundary et all @xcite , where unfortunately the limit yields  of the multitude of available boundary conditions  only the most simple ones .",
    "there are also fresh results @xcite on the case with dirichlet boundary but in general the approach based on squeezed manifolds did not yield so far a satisfactory answer to the question .",
    "another , maybe less ambitious approach is to model vertex boundary conditions through families of interactions on the graph itself . here",
    "two cases have to be distinguished . in the @xmath6-parameter family",
    "mentioned above the boundary conditions with wave functions _ continuous at the vertex _ form just one - parameter subfamily .",
    "these boundary conditions can be approximated by families of scaled potentials in analogy is analogy with one - dimensional @xmath1 interactions @xcite . the remaining , _ more singular _",
    "cases require a different approach .",
    "an inspiration may be derived from the approximation of one - dimensional @xmath7 interactions suggested , somewhat surprisingly , by cheon and shigehara in @xcite and elaborated in a mathematically consistent way in @xcite .",
    "it is based on a family of @xmath1 interactions which approach each other being scaled in a particular nonlinear way . an analogous procedure for vertices of degree @xmath8",
    "was proposed in @xcite in the case of the so - called @xmath9 coupling ; the key element here was the symmetry with respect to permutation of the edges which allowed to reduce the analysis to a one - dimensional halfline problem .",
    "the same technique was afterwards in @xcite applied to the class of all permutation - symmetric boundary conditions which form a two - parameter subfamily in the @xmath6-parameter set .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to explore whether the idea of @xcite can be adapted to situations without a permutation symmetry and how wide class of boundary conditions can be in this way described . as in the work mentioned above",
    "we will consider a _ star graph _ with a single vertex and @xmath0 semi - infinite edges .",
    "for simplicity we will also assume that the motion on graphs edges is _ free _ ; the obtained approximations extend easily to schrdinger operators on the graph provided the potentials involved are sufficiently regular around the vertex .",
    "we are going to show that the cheon - shigehara technique can produce for @xmath10 at most a @xmath2-parameter family of boundary conditions at the vertex .",
    "furthermore , we will demonstrate that such an approximations , with two @xmath1 interaction at each edge , do indeed exist and that they converge in the norm resolvent topology .",
    "the next question is how to extend the approximation to a wider class of couplings .",
    "a natural possibility is amend the star by extra edges supporting @xmath1 interactions which shrink to the `` main '' vertex with the parameter controlling the approximation .",
    "we devise such a scheme a show that it yields an @xmath3-parameter family , generically _ all _ couplings which are _ time - reversal invariant_. in this case , however , we restrict ourselves to deriving the boundary condition formally .",
    "we are convinced that the norm resolvent convergence could be verified as in the case mentioned but the argument would be extremely cumbersome .",
    "notice that the idea of using additional edges to model singular couplings appeared already in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to that paper , however , we keep here the number of added edges fixed .",
    "let us review briefly the contents of the paper . in the next section",
    "we gather the needed preliminary information .",
    "we review the quantum graph concept , recall different vertex couplings and review briefly the known approximations . in section",
    "3 we analyze a cs - type approximation to the vertex in a star graph based on adding @xmath1 interactions on star edges , the following section is devoted to the proof of norm - resolvent convergence .",
    "finally , in section  5 we will describe the mentioned more general approximation with extra edges added to the star graph .",
    "let us first recall a few basic notions .",
    "a _ graph _",
    "@xmath11 is an ordered pair @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are finite or countably infinite sets of _ vertices _ and _ edges _ , respectively . without loss of generality",
    "we may identify @xmath14 with a family of two - element subsets in @xmath13 , excluding thus loops and multiple edges , since in the opposite case we can simply add extra vertices .",
    "the vertex _ degree _ of @xmath15 is the number of edges which have @xmath16 as its endpoint .",
    "@xmath11 is a _ metric graph _",
    "if each of its edges can be equipped with a distance , i.e. identified with a finite or semi - infinite interval of length @xmath17 $ ] ; the endpoints `` at infinity '' are conventionally not counted as vertices .",
    "in particular a _ star graph _ has a finite number @xmath8 of edges and a single _ centre _ which is the only vertex where all the edges ( called also _",
    "arms _ in this case ) meet .",
    "the subject of our interest is quantum mechanics on graphs .",
    "given a metric graph @xmath11 with edges @xmath18 we identify the orthogonal sum @xmath19 with the state hilbert space , i.e. the wave function of a spinless particle `` living '' on @xmath11 can be written as the column @xmath20 with @xmath21 . in the absence of external fields",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath22 acts as @xmath23 , where as usual we put @xmath24 .",
    "its domain consists of functions from @xmath25 ; since @xmath22 is required to be a self - adjoint operator they must satisfy appropriate boundary conditions at the vertices which we will recall below .",
    "the meaning of these boundary condition is our main concern in this paper , therefore we restrict ourselves to graphs with a single vertex , namely star graphs with @xmath0 semi - infinite edges @xmath26 ; we denote them as @xmath11 or @xmath27 .      since the hamiltonian mentioned above",
    "is a second - order operator , the matching conditions involve boundary values of the functions in the vertex and of their first derivatives . both regarded as one - sided limits , the derivatives are taken in the outward direction .",
    "we arrange them into column vectors @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the self - adjointness of @xmath22 , which in the physical language means conservation of probability current at the vertex , is expressed through a linear relation between these vectors , @xmath30 by @xcite the operator @xmath22 is self - adjoint if and only if @xmath31 satisfy the conditions @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the @xmath34 matrix with @xmath35 forming the first and the second @xmath0 columns , respectively .",
    "this parametrization is obviously non - unique , since @xmath35 can be replaced by @xmath36 with any regular @xmath37 matrix @xmath38 .",
    "this defect can be corrected by choosing the matrices in the standard form @xcite , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is an @xmath37 unitary matrix ; the hamiltonian corresponding to this condition will be labelled as @xmath41 .",
    "elements of this family are labelled by @xmath6 real parameters which is , of course , the right number because all the @xmath41 are self - adjoint extensions of a common symmetric restriction with deficiency indices @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "let us next recall a few examples of the boundary conditions ( [ parametrizace ] ) . as mentioned in the introduction , the requirement of continuity at the vertex selects a one - parameter subfamily corresponding to the so - called _",
    "@xmath1 coupling _",
    ", @xmath43 where @xmath44 and for brevity we have introduced the symbol @xmath45 . we can add the case corresponding formally to @xmath46 , when the system decomposes into @xmath0 halflines with dirichlet endpoints , however , it is not interesting as long as we are concerned with nontrivial vertex couplings . in the particular case",
    "@xmath47 we speak about _ free boundary conditions _ since for the @xmath1 function on line , @xmath48 , this corresponds to a free motion ( sometimes the term kirchhoff b.c .",
    ", not very appropriate , is used ) . in terms of ( [ parametrizace ] )",
    "the @xmath1 coupling corresponds to the matrix @xmath49 , where @xmath50 denotes the @xmath37 matrix whose all entries equal one .",
    "the @xmath7 interaction on the line has two possible analogues for @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "one is a counterpart to ( [ delta ] ) called _ @xmath9 coupling _ with the role of @xmath52 interchanged , @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "it corresponds to @xmath55 , in particular , the case @xmath56 refers to full neumann decoupling .",
    "the other one , called @xmath7 _ coupling _ , is @xmath57 with @xmath54 which corresponds to @xmath58 .",
    "all the above examples have a common property , namely that the corresponding operators are invariant with respect to permutation of the edges , which is clear from the fact that matrices @xmath40 are not changed by a simultaneous permutations of the rows and columns . the most general family of @xmath41 with this property is characterized by two parameters , @xmath59 with @xmath60 and @xmath61 , _ cf .",

    "\\nonumber   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      let us next recall briefly known results about approximations of vertex couplings starting from the @xmath1 coupling .",
    "the idea is the same as for @xmath1 interactions on the line .",
    "let @xmath63 be the corresponding matrix of the condition ( [ parametrizace ] ) . given a family of real - valued functions @xmath64 , for simplicity assumed to be compactly supported , we define scaled potentials at graph edges by @xmath65 starting from the free boundary conditions and choosing the family ( [ scaled potentials ] ) we can approximate any nontrivial @xmath1 coupling as the following result shows .",

    "denote the operator @xmath41 corresponding to @xmath59 with @xmath70 satisfying the stated conditions as @xmath71 .",
    "the approximating family can be constructed as follows : we start from the operator @xmath72 and pass to @xmath73 obtained by adding a @xmath1 interaction of strength @xmath16 on each edge at a distance @xmath74 from the centre .",

    "the first question is how large is the class of operators @xmath41 which can can be treated in this way .",
    "we are going to answer it using the technique of @xcite , i.e. looking into convergence of the corresponding boundary conditions .",
    "[ admissible ] let @xmath11 be a star graph with @xmath0 semi - infinite edges and @xmath90 be a graph obtained from @xmath11 by adding a finite number of vertices at each edge . consider a family @xmath91 of such graphs with the properties that the number of the added vertices at each edge is independent of @xmath74 and their distances from the centre are @xmath92 as @xmath93 .",

    "the family of the conditions ( [ 1 ] ) which can be obtained in this way depends on @xmath2 parameters if @xmath10 , and on three parameters for @xmath48 .",
    "the @xmath1 coupling in the centre of @xmath11 is expressed by the condition ( [ delta ] ) .",
    "consider first @xmath1 interactions on a halfline and look how the boundary values change when we pass between different sites .",
    "suppose that at a point @xmath99 the function and its derivative have the right limits , and that @xmath100 is the site of a @xmath1 interaction , then the taylor expansion gives @xmath101 and the @xmath1 interaction is according to ( [ delta ] ) described by @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the coupling parameter .",
    "the may be @xmath104-dependent but we suppose such a dependence that the error terms can be neglected as @xmath105 ; then we have @xmath106 so that @xmath107 and @xmath108 depend on @xmath109 and @xmath110 linearly up to error terms . in case of a finite number of @xmath1 interactions on a halfline one can show in a similar way recursively that the function value and the right limit of the derivative at the site of the last @xmath1 depends , up to error terms , linearly on the function value and the right limit of the derivative for the first @xmath1 interaction .",
    "let us apply this conclusion to the edges of our star graph .",
    "we denote by @xmath111 the distance of the last @xmath1 interaction on the @xmath4-th halfline family of edges in @xmath90 ; by assumption we have @xmath112",

    "that we multiply both sides by a power of @xmath74 such that the right - hand side tends to zero as @xmath93 , while at least one coefficient at the left - hand side remains nonzero , in other words , we use the assumed existence of the limit in which the error terms can be neglected w.r.t . the leading ones .",
    "the equation   acquires then the form @xmath128 while   gives @xmath129 where @xmath130 are the appropriate limiting values of the functions involved .",
    "the obtained conditions can also be written in a matrix form , @xmath131 it is clear already now  from the fact that the coefficients @xmath132 are real - valued  that the achievable number of parameters can not exceed @xmath133 .",
    "so far we have not brought the self - adjointness into the game . to find the true number of parameters we pass from @xmath98 to the unitary matrix @xmath40 of standard boundary conditions ( [ parametrizace ] ) .",
    "this is achieved by multiplying the relation   from the left by a regular matrix @xmath134 such that @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "this determines @xmath40 since the last relations imply @xmath137 notice that @xmath138 is regular because @xmath139 and @xmath140 are real and the matrix @xmath141 has he full rank by assumption .",
    "hence we have @xmath142 , which further gives @xmath143 we shall apply the gauss elimination method to get the chain of equivalences @xmath144 the explicit form of @xmath145 is obtained from ( [ opab ] ) .",
    "we notice that the regularity of @xmath146 implies the following facts : ( i ) there is at most one @xmath147 such that @xmath148 ( and for such a @xmath4 it holds that @xmath149 ) , ( ii ) there is at least one @xmath147 such that @xmath150 .",
    "the matrix @xmath151 equals to @xmath152 suppose first that @xmath153 for all @xmath147 , then by equivalent row manipulations we pass to the matrix @xmath154 , where @xmath155 where we have denoted @xmath156 .",
    "since we used only equivalent manipulations , the diagonal matrix @xmath157 should have the same rank as @xmath138 , hence it must be regular because none of its diagonal elements is zero .",
    "consequently , we can divide each row of @xmath154 by the corresponding diagobal element of @xmath157 .",
    "this yields @xmath158 , where @xmath40 is the sought unitary matrix and its diagonal and off - diagonal elements are given by @xmath159 the right - hand sides make sense due to the first of the conditions ( [ op ] ) and our assumptions about non - vanishing of all the expressions @xmath160 .",
    "so far we have not employed the second one of the requirements , namely the self - adjointness of the matrix @xmath161 .",
    "this is equivalent to unitarity of @xmath40 , however , it is easier to check it in its original version . by a straightforward computation we find that the product @xmath162 equals @xmath163",
    "hence @xmath161 is self - adjoint if and only if @xmath164 holds for all @xmath165 , and therefore @xmath166 we denote the common value @xmath167 as @xmath168 and recall that we have denoted @xmath156 , then the matrix @xmath40 given by   can be simplified , @xmath169 let us show that the matrix   can be parametrized by @xmath2 real numbers .",
    "we rewrite the quantity @xmath170 introduced above in the following way , @xmath171 and make first several observations : ( i ) regarding   as a system of linear equations its solvability is not affected if the last one is multiplied by a nonzero number . at the same time , the value of @xmath168 is directly proportional to @xmath172 , @xmath173 , and consequently , one can suppose without loss of generality that @xmath174 ( the case @xmath175 gives rise to the same situation as @xmath176 which we shall discuss below ) , ( ii ) if @xmath177 the imaginary part of @xmath170 is determined only by the values of @xmath178 , ( iii ) and finally , one can also suppose without loss of generality that @xmath179 , since in the opposite case we can divide all but the last of the equations in the system   by @xmath180 which is nonzero by assumption .    with the above convention we can denote @xmath181 and @xmath182 so that @xmath183 and @xmath40 can be written explicitly as @xmath184 being dependent on @xmath2 real parameters @xmath185 .",
    "the above argument applies to any @xmath10 . in the case",
    "@xmath48 the situation is somewhat different , because we have @xmath186 but   does not give the whole family of unitary @xmath187 matrices ; notice that the off - diagonal elements coincide .",
    "it is easy to show that the admissible @xmath40 can be for @xmath48 characterized by three real parameters . indeed , writing @xmath188 the unitarity requirement reads @xmath189 knowing the modulus and phase of @xmath190 , the modulus of @xmath191 is determined so one has to choose its phase .",
    "furthermore , since we assume @xmath192 the element @xmath95 is uniquely determined .",
    "hence the matrix @xmath40 of   is described by three parameters which can be chosen , e.g. , as the real parts of @xmath193 and the phase of @xmath194 .",
    "returning to the general case one can also write the conditions ( [ 1 ] ) explicitly in terms of the parameters .",
    "a straightforward way is to put @xmath195 with @xmath40 given by  . to get a simpler expression",
    "one can pass from the system @xmath196 to an equivalent one multiplying it from the left by the matrix @xmath197 this yields an explicit parametrization of the conditions ( [ 1 ] ) with @xmath198 b&= \\left ( \\begin{array}{ccccc }      \\sin\\theta & -t_2 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\      \\sin\\theta & 0 & -t_3 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\      \\vdots & & & \\ddots & \\\\",
