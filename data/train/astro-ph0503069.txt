    "successive merging and accretion of many comparatively small stellar systems like dwarf galaxies , as well as intergalactic gas , is an important part of the theoretical framework in which large ( disk ) galaxies are predicted to have formed ( e.g. , white & rees 1978 ; steinmetz & muller 1995 ) .",
    "significantly , studies of resolved stars in dwarf companions ultimately allow one to explore two paired issues , namely giant galaxy assembly as well as the star formation history of dwarfs , which describes the gradual conversion of gas into stars , followed by the expulsion of remaining gas by stellar winds and the resultant heating and cooling of the interstellar medium .",
    "since baade ( 1944a , 1944b ) first succeeded in resolving the brightest stars of several dwarf elliptical ( de ) satellites of the giant spiral galaxy andromeda , those galaxies have been regarded as simple , old stellar systems , with a stellar content resembling that of galactic globular clusters ( population ii ) . from the mid-1990s onward",
    "however the impressive improvement in the quality of colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) for nearby de galaxies provided by the hst has revealed that those  simple \" galaxies often display varied , and in some cases , complex star formation histories ( sfhs ) ( da costa 1998 ; mateo 1998 ) .",
    "however , it remains unclear whether the andromeda de companions ( ngc 205 , ngc 147 and ngc 185 ) have had significant star formation episodes since the primeval event ( see da costa 1998 for a recent review ) .",
    "the existence of a dozen luminous blue stars ( baade 1944a ) and other population  i features ( dust clouds , hi gas , sn remnant ) at the centre of ngc 185 has been an intriguing feature of this galaxy for several decades because such galaxy building blocks had been alledged to have been depleted at earlier formation epochs in elliptical galaxies .",
    "this recent star formation epoch is confined to its central 150 @xmath0 90pc , where the youngest , 100myr old , population is found ( hodge 1963 ; lee , freedman & madore 1993 ; martinez - delgado , aparicio & gallart 1999 , hereafter md99 ) . in ngc 147",
    "however , there are no signs of recent star formation ( in the past 1gyr ) or gas at its centre ( han et al .",
    "1997 ; young & lo 1997 ; sage , welch & mitchell 1998 ) .",
    "thus , this difference between ngc 185 and ngc 147 is intriguing because otherwise they are similar in many of their properties ( e.g. type , mass , size ) .",
    "similarly , ngc 205 has been regarded as an unusual de galaxy  it has gas ( johnson & gottesman 1983 ; young & lo 1997 ) and a young central stellar population ( baade 1944b ; lee 1996 ) , and many of the brightest objects have recently been resolved into groups of uv - bright stars ( cappellari et al .",
    "so , why do the recent ( @xmath12 1gyr ) sfhs of andromeda s de companions differ ?",
    "a natural way to probe this issue is to search for an intermediate - age ( 1 - 10 gyr ) population in these galaxies .",
    "the first evidence of such a population in these galaxies was the presence of stars above the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) in cmds from ground - based observations of their inner regions ( ngc 205 : lee 1996 ; ngc 185 : lee et al .",
    "1993 , martinez - delgado & aparicio 1998 , hereafter mda98 ; and ngc 147 : davidge 1994 ) and have been interpreted as intermediate - age agb stars by several authors ( davidge 1994 ; lee et al .",
    "1993 ; lee 1996 ) .",
    "however , ground - based observations can lead to severe central crowding , making rgb stars appear brighter than they are , mimicking an intermediate - age agb population ( martinez - delgado & aparicio 1997 ) .",
    "two other paired issues are the origin and possible stripping of the gas from which young stars are born in such galaxies .",
    "one could view the concentration of young stars lying in the central part of ngc 185 and ngc 205 as a hint that new stars could originate from material ejected by dying stars and that this process would only be efficient enough at the center of the galaxies .",
    "this would suggest an internal origin for the gas in these systems , as was argued by faber & gallagher ( 1976 ) .",
    "however , young & lo ( 1997 ) find different scenarios for the three andromeda de satellites : no gas in ngc 147 ( m@xmath13/l@xmath14m@xmath9/l@xmath9)/l@xmath15 data is taken from from grebel , gallagher & harbeck ( 2003 ; their table 1 ) ] ; gas with a different angular momentum per unit mass to the stars in ngc 205 ( m@xmath13/l@xmath16m@xmath9/l@xmath9 ) ; and gas kinematically compatible with that of the stellar component in ngc 185 ( m@xmath13/l@xmath17m@xmath9/l@xmath9 ) .",
    "although several theories ( e.g. external origin : knapp et al . 1985 ; ram - pressure stripping : lin & faber 1983 ; or different initial conditions ",
    "( e.g. , gas number density and gas mass ) : hensler & burkert 1989 ) have been proposed to explain this puzzling situation in dwarf galaxies , the exact origin of the current inner region differences remains a mystery .    in the present paper ,",
    "we draw on a new colour magnitude diagram  based analysis of resolved stellar populations in ngc 205 and ngc 185 to take a new look at their ages and abundances .",

    "stellar magnitudes are calibrated by hstphot using the charge transfer efficiency and zero point magnitude corrections derived by dolphin ( 2000b ) and are transformed into the v- and i - band passes .",

    "knowledge of the extinction towards stars is a basic necessity for determining their distances , masses , chemical compositions and ages . for an upper limit on the extinction from m31 s dust clouds in front of ngc 205 , plus foreground extinction due to the galaxy",
    ", we recall that extinction in several outer disk fields in m31 has been estimated to be of the order of e(b - v)= 0.13mag ( e.g. , hodge & lee 1988 ; bellazzini et al .",
    "2003 / bcf03 ) with a dispersion in their values of about 25% . for an estimate of the foreground extinction alone , towards m31/ngc 205 , we adopt e(b - v ) = 0.086mag from the schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ; sf98 ) dust maps .",
    "as ngc 205 is behind m31 ( e.g. sec .",
    "[ sec_dist_results ] ) with a projected location at the far outer edge of m31 , one might presume e(b - v ) @xmath12 0.13mag , i.e. , smaller than values measured using outer disk stars of m31 . as a reasonable compromise",
    ", we adopt the average of extinction data for the m31 outer disk and the sfd98 value , namely e(b - v ) = 0.11mag , and assume the galactic reddening law with a@xmath15 = 3.1@xmath0e(b - v ) and a@xmath20/a@xmath15 = 0.48 ( cardelli , clayton & mathias 1989 ) .",
    "a further issue is the internal extinction in ngc 205 .",
    "about a dozen dust patches in the central 1 - 2@xmath21 have been catalogued , the largest of which points toward differential extinction values of up to about 0.4mag in v - band ( hodge 1973 ) .",
    "those patches occupy about 5% of the f4 field , and their effect on results in the present paper is minor as determined by repeated tests in which photometry from 5% of each field was dimmed , conservatively , by 0.3mag  the resulting systematic change in rgb / faint - agb colours is up to 0.02mag or 0.01mag in distance modulus with a negligible change in [ fe / h ] .",
    "however , there remains the possibility of systematic errors with a similar order of magnitude due to a larger area being affected by a smaller level of extinction ( e.g. 0.05mag ) .    for ngc 185 and",
    "ngc 147 , foreground extinction estimates from sfd98 are e(b - v ) = 0.184mag and 0.173mag respectively",
    ". however , ngc 185 and ngc 147 are located closer to the galactic plane ( b@xmath4 - 14.5@xmath22 ) than ngc 205 ( b@xmath4 - 21@xmath22 ) , and so , it is important to be aware of the possibility of significant inaccuracy in sfd98 extinction estimates towards low galactic latitudes that has yet to be established ( for @xmath23b@xmath23 @xmath12 10@xmath22 at least ; see sfd98 ) .",
    "it is however rather encouraging that the above - mentioned extinction estimate from sfd98 for ngc 185 is in very good agreement with the result of a direct measurement of the stellar colour excess , i.e. e(b - v ) = 0.19@xmath60.03mag ( lee et al .",

    "the most prominent feature is the rgb - like structure , the upper two magnitudes of which is very similar to that found by mda98 in a low spatial resolution study of ngc 185 .",
    "this structure is typical of a galaxy that clearly comprises a mixed stellar population : it is the locus of old and intermediate - age rgb stars , as well as faint agb stars .",

    "[ youngstars ] .    in ngc 205 , somewhat like ngc 185 , there is a prominent sequence of rgb / faint - agb stars , similar to that presented by lee ( 1996 ) . that upper sequence does not appear to have a homogeneous colour distribution at a given i - band magnitude , which we detail in sec .",
    "[ secabundance_distrib ] .",

    "there is also a scatter of stars redward of the rgb / faint - agb ( v - i @xmath8 3 ) ; they could be very metal - rich stars that belong to m31 and are briefly mentioned later in sec .  [ tails ] .",
    "lastly , the ngc 205 cmds contain several bright , blue stars ( at i@xmath223 , ( v - i)@xmath12 1 ) that are probably mostly main sequence and blue loop stars ; they are examined further in sec .",
    "[ youngstars ] .    for an analysis of",
    "how much the ngc 205 cmds are contaminated by m31 stars , we used a b - band isopleth map of ngc 205 ( with an elliptically averaged surface brightness profile of m31 subtracted ; fig . 9 of ferguson et al .",
    "2002 ) and minor axis surface brightness data for m31 from walterbos & kennicutt ( 1988 ; wk88 ) .",
    "it follows that 16 - 40% of the brightest stars ( probably field stars , upper ms / blue loop stars and upper agb / rgb stars ) across the f1 field belong to m31 . adopting that level of contamination",

    "( 2003 ) for a nearby field distant from ngc 205 and lies between ngc 205 and m31 . ] ( g58 ) , we found 1193 stars at i @xmath12 22.5mag . scaling that number for ngc 205 , where the m31 halo is approximately 1.5mag arcsec@xmath24 fainter ,",
    "the estimated contamination is in good agreement with the previous estimate of 16 - 40% ; and can be applied for agb / rgb stars at i @xmath12 22.5mag .",
    "changing now to the f2 field , the contamination level should be below 1% , which is negligible , and even less for the remaining fields which are closer to the nucleus of ngc 205 .",
    "additional evidence that contamination from m31 stars decreases towards ngc 205 comes from the blue plume or upper main sequence population in m31 : i.e. , compare the blue plume in fields g58 , g64 and g108 from bcf03 .",
    "we note that about half a dozen bright , blue stars occur at v - i @xmath12 1mag and 20@xmath12 i ( mag ) @xmath12 21 in each ngc 205 field",
    " they may well be foreground stars , even though inspection of nearby ( control ) fields , g58 and g64 ( see fig .",
    "5 & 6 in bcf03 ) , argues for a negligible surface density of foreground stars .",
    "alternately , they might be members of ngc 205 , but that interpretation is disfavoured in sec .",
    "[ youngstars ] .    for ngc 185 and ngc 147 ,",
    "the surface density of ( unobscured ) field stars ( and point - like field galaxies ) along the line of sight is taken to be 65@xmath68 and 70@xmath68 stars respectively per wfpc2 pointing at i@xmath2 22.2mag and dominated by stars redder than about r - i = 0.4mag ( battinelli & demers 2004a , 2004b ) .",
    "their surface density is such that they are unlikely to have a significant effect on our distance / abundance measurements later .",
    "as we consider the population of ms and blue - loop stars later , we note that some contamination by field stars at r - i @xmath12 0.4mag is possible , but the level should be negligible ( @xmath12@xmath12 few percent of the field surface densities given above ) on average based on an inspection of the cmds from the battinelli & demers wide - field study . the number of contaminating field galaxies was estimated to be 23@xmath65 per wfpc2 pointing at 20 @xmath12 i ( mag ) @xmath12 22 from the medium deep survey ( griffiths et al .",
    "1994 ) , which is an unlikely source of significant contamination that was not assessed by the artificial star tests .",
    "in the absence of star - to - star abundance information from spectroscopic measurements , popular ways to measure distances and to infer [ fe / h ] values for ancient stars in local group galaxies have included the rgb method , the horizontal branch ( hb ) v - band magnitude , rr lyrae stars , and the turn - off magnitude of main sequence stars .",
    "we consider the first two of these .",
    "such diagnostic tools have , necessarily , been calibrated using ancient stellar populations ( galactic globular clusters ; ggcs ) ; and are thus best applied to a single stellar population of similar ancient age ( e.g. 13gyr ) . clearly , our photometry does not sample such simple stellar populations but for ngc 185 and ngc 147 there is evidence that their stellar populations are mostly ancient , with a small intermediate - age component ",
    "see md99 ( ngc 185 ) and han et al .",
    "( 1997 ; ngc 147 ) . for ngc 205 however we are less certain because of the possibility of a significant fraction of intermediate - age stars .    on the reliability of the absolute magnitude - abundance relation for the hb , on which the hb method relies",
    ", we recall the relation is controversial in the literature ( e.g. see caputo 1997 , and references therein ) due to the dependence of m@xmath25(rr lyrae ) on the composition and evolutionary phase of the variable star .",
    "that leads to a possible range in [ fe / h ] of the order of 0.2dex for a given absolute v - band magnitude . despite this caveat",
    ", there is an advantage to using both the hb magnitude method together with the rgb method , namely that in stellar systems dominated by ancient stars with similar abundance levels , one would expect an agreement , within uncertainties , between the two methods . based upon the hypothesis that the rgb is dominated by ancient stars with similar abundance levels to those of the hb stars",
    ", we will make a comparison of the inferred abundance estimates .      in the present paper , when we refer to stellar abundance ( or metallicity ) , we are referring to [ fe / h ] as inferred from the colour ( ( v - i)@xmath26 ) at a certain absolute i - band magnitude for ancient stellar populations . in this way , we are making an inference of the metallicity of ancient rgb stars , using an approach that can be applied to other stellar systems .",
    "a key concern however is the so - called age - metallicity degeneracy in stellar populations comprising ancient and intermediate - age stars .",
    "the trouble is that evolved ( i.e. , post - main sequence ) stars that are between about one and a few times 10@xmath27yr old evolve along the blue side of the rgb causing the inferred median ( or mean ) colour to be bluer than that of the ancient rgb stars .",
    "we use the median colour as opposed to the mean value as the median is a more reliable tracer of the predominant colour when the colour distribution is skewed  otherwise the median and mean values are identical . however , whichever of these two statistics is used , an inferred ( mean / median ) [ fe / h ] value will under - estimate the actual [ fe / h ] of ancient rgb stars , and so our photometric abundance is taken as a lower limit as is done implicitly in other studies that determine photometric abundances ( see grebel , gallagher & harbeck 2003 ) .",
    "photometric abundances are useful because they are available for a wide range of systems , thereby allowing them to be compared .",
    "for example , see grebel , gallagher & harbeck 2003 , their section 2.1 , for a useful comparison of nearby dwarf galaxy properties .      for the rgb - tip indicator of distance and [ fe / h ] ,",
    "one requires a knowledge of the tip i - band magnitude of the rgb , i@xmath28 , and its uncertainty . in the case of ngc 205 , we estimated i@xmath28 by applying a slightly modified version of the edge - detection method described by sakai et al .",
    "i.e. , we evaluated the edge - detection response at fine intervals ( @xmath1210@xmath29mag ) followed by smoothing using a 0.05mag - wide moving - average window and recorded the peak response in a restricted magnitude range ( i@xmath1221mag ) .",
    "that was repeated a few hundred times in a bootstrap way to measure the average tip magnitude and its uncertainty .",
    "for the inner two fields combined , we found i@xmath28 = 20.85@xmath60.1mag where the uncertainty includes a conservative error to account for the probable slight bias introduced by the smoothing process .",
    "for ngc 185 and ngc 147 , we could not accurately identify the rgb tip magnitude using the edge - detection approach using individual fields as there are too few stars , making the rgb tip poorly defined . using the ensemble data for ngc 185 , but restricting the edge detection to i @xmath12 20.5 , we find i@xmath28 = 20.4 @xmath60.1mag which is close to the value from nowotny et al .",
    "( 2003 ; nk03 )  one obtains i@xmath28 = 20.31mag for ngc 185 from their data . however , as their detection criterion is much better , owing to significantly more stars , we adopt their value , which agrees with previous estimates in the literature ( lee et al .",
    "1993 ; mda98 ; ngc 185 ) . for ngc 147",

    "however , there is a marked discrepancy between the nk03 finding of -0.89dex for ngc 185 and our value that can be explained by a mis - match between the foreground extinction adopted by nk03 ( a@xmath15=0.48mag ) and our value ( a@xmath15=0.57mag , from sfd98 ) : that extinction difference causes their value to be systematically more metal - rich than our finding , by about 0.2dex .    for ngc 147",

    "lastly , our inferred [ fe / h ] lower limit is -1.06@xmath60.04dex from the rgb method , which is markedly more metal - poor than the mould , kristian & da costa ( 1984 ) inference that was based on rgb colour information from seeing - limited data ( [ fe / h ] @xmath5 -0.85@xmath60.2dex ) .",
    "just like the discrepancy we found for ngc 185 between our [ fe / h ] value nk03 result , mentioned above , a probable cause is a systematic under - estimation of foreground extinction by about ( a@xmath15 =) 0.1mag by mould et al .",

    "accordingly , with the help of the wide dereddened colour baseline ( v - k)@xmath26 , it follows from visual inspection that even with the sizeable hypothetical extinction error , the metal - rich component of the rgb is probably at least as rich as -0.7dex .",
    "another issue is whether there are radial changes in the shapes of inferred distributions , for which one can make use of the skewness parameter listed in table  [ abund_summary ] .",
    "there is no clear evidence for ngc 185 , but ngc 205 becomes systematically redder towards its inner regions . that finding is unlikely to be affected by strong differential extinction , which affects only a small fraction ( @xmath4 5% ) of the central field",

    "on the issue of metal - poor stars , it is hard to make a firm statement regarding the accuracy of a metal - poor tail reaching to [ fe / h]@xmath12 -1.5dex without spectroscopic information and or evidence for a hb , simply because stellar ages are unknown . for ngc 185",
    "however we know that at least some of the stars in the metal - poor tail should be ancient because of the presence of a hb reaching to colours as blue as v - i @xmath4 0.1 - 0.2mag .",
    "another issue is the similarity of the distributions . in the case of ngc 205",
    ", we determined whether the shape of the control field and ngc 205 distributions differ .",

    "[ cmd_description ] ) , we infer that the rgb / faint - agb sequence in ngc 205 is significantly redder than that in the control field ( g58 ) .",
    "the rgb / faint - agb sequence in ngc 205 is also skewed to redder colours than the sequence in ngc 147 or ngc 185 .",
    "an exact interpretation for the rgb / faint - agb sequence ngc 205 is out of reach without modeling using data with a much fainter magnitude limit , but the skewness data hints that a significant fraction of the rgb / faint - agb stars occur in a relatively narrow age and or abundance interval compared to the control field .",
    "finally , we note that skewness varies markedly with radial position in ngc 205 , in the sense that the inner region stars are generally redder than the outer region stars ; and it is unlikely to be fully attributeable to contamination from m31 .",
    "from the poorly defined red - end of the bright agb , we infer z@xmath4 0.1z@xmath9 at ( v - i)@xmath26 @xmath4 3.5mag , with higher abundances likely for redder colours based on synthetic cmds . for a comparison",

    "similarly , the mean oxygen abundance ( 12 + log ( o / h ) = 8.2 ) from several planetary nebulae ( pne ) ( richer & mc call 1995 ) is consistent with a system whose most metal - rich stars have about one third of the solar abundance .",
    "consequently , there is rough agreement with our cmd - based finding .    in ngc 205 ,",
    "the reddest pair of agb stars reach to ( v - i)@xmath26@xmath44.3mag corresponding to z@xmath4 0.0065 , about one third of the solar value .",
    "consequently , abundances in ngc 205 appear to reach to richer values than in ngc 185 , a fact that is supported by the richer mean oxygen abundance for ngc 205 ( 12 + log ( o / h ) = 8.6 ; richer & mc call 1995 ) .",
    "further on the subject of metal - rich stars , there are some very red stars ( v - i @xmath83 ) below the i - band rgb tip magnitude in ngc 185 and ngc 205 . whether those stars belong to ngc 205 is unclear , but such stars occur in m31 fields .",
    "for example , bcf03 found them in wfpc2 photometry of m31 halo fields and noted that such stars would be highly metal - rich , if they are members of m31 .",
    "examination of such stars with high abundance levels is largely precluded by incompleteness and model uncertainties .",
    "stellar evolution theory predicts that the luminosity of the rgb and agb bumps in the colour magnitude plane depends on stellar abundance and age .",
    "such theory also predicts a red hb in intermediate - age to  ancient stars . in the present section we consider the red bump / clump ( rc ) and the prominent hb in ngc 185 .    for the mean rc magnitude in each band - pass , we fitted gaussian function to the rc a few hundred times in a bootstrap way ( see sec .",

    "it is unclear whether the rc actually comprises rgb / faint - agb stars , a red hb , or both .",

    "6 we infer that [ fe / h ] would be about -1.5dex at @xmath3v(bump- hb ) = 0 for ancient stars , with a higher abundance level for intermediate - age stars , regardless of whether the v - band magnitude of the red hb is the same for all ages or one considers the theoretical age - dependence adopted by alves & sarajedini ( 1999 ) .",

    "on the other hand they occur in each field with no significant radial trend in the dwarf galaxy .",
    "additionally , from a visual inspection there is an ( apparent ) paucity of blue stars , e.g. , v - i@xmath120.5mag , at v@xmath4 21.5 - 23mag that is hard to explain by a conspiracy of incompleteness functions , and is inconsistent with a main sequence / blue loop population .",
    "we take the opinion that the bright , blue stars are not the upper part of a main sequence / blue loop stellar population , but rather that they are probably foreground stars .    for the fainter , blue stars at ( v @xmath2 23 ,",

    "lastly , we note that with an orbital period of 10@xmath1yr ( cepa & beckman 1988 ) , it is possible that a past disk crossing triggered the recent star formation activity .",
    "in the case of ngc 185 , there are about two dozen blue stars ( v - i @xmath21mag ) at v @xmath4 20.5 - 23mag in the ensemble cmd presented in fig  [ ngc185_v_vicmd_isochr ] . a comparison with models ( see sec .  [ cmd_description ] )",
    "indicates that the bulk of them are probably foreground stars owing to ngc 185 s low galactic latitude , but some red supergiants from ngc 185 may be present as noted by nowothny et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and martinez - delgado & aparicio ( 1998 ) .",
    "another point against them as members of ngc 185 is that a significant number of fainter stars would be needed if the stars were actually ms and blue loop stars .",
    "however , the presence of a significant population of faint blue stars at v@xmath824mag ( excluding the hb of ancient stars at v@xmath425 - 25.5mag ) argues for a real population of ms and blue loop stars .",
    "guided by the isochrones in fig  [ ngc185_v_vicmd_isochr ] , one infers that star formation was probably still active about 4@xmath010@xmath1yr ago .",
    "we have not tried to derive the star formation history of the faint blue stars at v@xmath824mag due to significant incompleteness at such faint magnitudes . however , although we detect the faint population of blue stars at v@xmath8 24.5mag based on visual inspection of the ensemble ( v , v - i ) cmd , the model produced by md99 ( their fig .",
    "16 ) , based on a synthetic cmd analysis , appears to be markedly fainter .",
    "thus , the mean sfr density for the last 10@xmath27yr is probably above the md99 estimate , i.e. , @xmath5 2.6@xmath010@xmath47m@xmath9yr@xmath48 pc@xmath24 at r @xmath12 2@xmath42 .",
    "next , we probe whether the mean age of young agb stars varies radially with respect to older stars . for that reason we list in table  [ agb_rgbratios ]",
    "the star counts and count ratios for bright , young agb stars ( i@xmath12 i@xmath28 ) and stars on the upper rgb / faint - agb sequence , defined in colour  magnitude space by boxes a and b respectively in fig .",

    "for ngc 205 , it follows that a real increase occurs in the mean ages of bright , young agb stars with respect to older stars towards the nuclear region , even if a conservative contamination level of 40% in the f1 field is included .",
    "simulating conservative systematic errors of 50% in e(v - i ) and / or 0.1mag , for example , in the distance modulus causes a shift of a few percent in bright , young agb star counts , but the conclusion remains unchanged .    in the ngc 185 ( and ngc 147 ) data , we find no statistically significant field - to - field changes in the mean ages of bright , young agb stars with respect to older stars .",
    "due to a relatively short crossing time in and between the wfpc2 fields , the agb and older stars could be well - mixed ( e.g. conservatively , take an rms velocity of 1kms@xmath48 ) , a case that would be compatible with the apparent absence of field - to - field variations .",
    "we can make a stab at answering the question using table  [ agb_rgbratios ] which lists the number of agb stars that are relatively young ( i.e. , are above the rgb i - band tip magnitude in ( i , v - i ) cmds ) , normalised by the number of fainter ( and mostly older ) stars , selected from suitable colour magnitude boxes ( see fig .  [ cmds1 ] ) .",
    "in fact , we are using ( i ) the fact that the brightness of a young agb star of a given chemical composition is a function of its age , meaning that brighter agb stars are younger and ( ii ) and that the population of ancient stars , which is probably significant , is fainter than the rgb i - band tip magnitude .",
    "we assume that there is a negligible contamination from ( a ) rgb stars near the rgb tip magnitude that might arise due to photometric scatter and ( b ) the number of mira variable stars occuring near the tip of the rgb that are in their bright state . as the fractional contributions of faint - agb and rgb stars",
    "is unknown , we consider the available low time resolution ( wide - age bins ) information offered by our star count data .",
    "consequently , we infer that the contribution of stars that formed in the past several 10@xmath49yr is significantly greater in ngc 205 than in ngc 185 or ngc 147 . for ngc 147",
    "the contribution is significantly greater than that in ngc 185 .",
    "ngc 205 offers an opportunity to study a bona fide nucleated dwarf satellite in our neighbourhood .",

    "a technical point is that the width of a wfpc2 stellar psf for a given filter depends on the spectral type(s ) of the reference stars ; however , as the cluster is well - resolved a mismatch between the spectral energy distribution of the psf and the nc has a negligible effect on the derived intrinsic profile of the cluster .",

    "that ngc 205 may have experienced interactions with m31 has been suggested in the literature ( e.g. , velocity dispersion : bender , paquest & nieto 1991 ; twisted outer isophotes : choi , guhathakurta & johnston 2002 ) .",
    "interactions can cause tidal stripping of stellar matter that could produce stellar sub - structure in so - called streams .",
    "the most prominent sub - structure around m31 belongs to its giant stellar stream ( ibata et al .",
    "2001 ; ferguson et al .",
    "recent kinematical evidence plus modeling suggests that it probably does not include ngc 205 ( ibata et al .",
    "2004 ) . our distance modulus measurement for ngc 205 , ( m - m)@xmath7 = 24.76@xmath60.1mag ( when e(b - v ) = 0.11mag ) , would support that result by placing ngc 205 at d @xmath4 890kpc , putting it farther behind m31 than previously estimated .",
    "we presented the first detailed study of ngc 205 and ngc 185 using wfpc2 data .",
    "our key results are :      * there is an ancient stellar sub - population in ngc 185 with [ fe / h ] @xmath2 -1.5dex , based on the presence of a well - defined horizontal branch . *",
    "we inferred the median [ fe / h ] of ancient stars ( @xmath510gyr ) in ngc 185 from colour information to be @xmath5 -1.11@xmath60.08dex , assuming e(b - v ) = 0.184mag . * in ngc 185 , we found no v - band offset between the red bump / clump and the hb v - band magnitude . from a comparison with theory ,",
    "that finding suggests that ancient stars have [ fe / h ] @xmath4 -1.5dex , with a higher abundance level for intermediate - age stars ( 1 - 10gyr ) .",
    "* we find that star formation was probably still active about 4@xmath010@xmath1yr ago .",
    "* whether there is a horizontal branch in ngc 205 is still an open question as the photometry s limiting magnitude is insufficient to detect central hb stars if they are present .",
    "* we determined that the rgb / faint - agb at each pointing in ngc 205 is significantly skewed to redder colours than that of our control field .",
    "that is probably the result of a narrower range in stellar abundances and or age for a significant fraction of the stars in ngc 205 than in the control field located on the outskirts of m31 .",
    "* we inferred the median [ fe / h ] of ancient stars in ngc 205 from colour information to be @xmath5 -1.06@xmath60.04 dex , assuming e(b - v ) = 0.11mag . *",
    "our analysis indicates that star formation activity in ngc 205 was probably still active less than 3@xmath010@xmath1yr ago .",
    "such recent star formation activity could have been triggered by an interaction with m31 .",
    "* we derived a new distance estimate using the rgb i - band tip magnitude method , obtaining ( m - m)@xmath26 = 24.76@xmath60.1mag , adopting e(b - v ) = 0.11mag .",
    "* several properties of the nuclear star cluster in ngc 205 have been examined : in terms of size and intensity , it is like a galactic globular cluster or a nuclear cluster in a late - type spiral galaxy ; but from a comparison with models , the blue colour hints that its stellar population is young , up a few times 10@xmath1yr old . the ( apparent ) v-/r - band effective radii indicates an excess of blue light with respect to red light in the cluster s outer region . + like the ncs in late - type spirals , which have 10@xmath10 - 10@xmath1l@xmath57 ( deduced from bker et al .",
    "2002 ) , and unlike ggcs , the nc in ngc 205 is quite bright , with 10@xmath58l@xmath64 .      in the introductory section we raised key questions about the similarities and differences between the three m31 dwarf companions .",
    "although an investigation of whether the galaxies had significant star formation episodes since the primeval occurrence is precluded by the low temporal resolution afforded by our cmds and also by the bright limiting magnitude of our cmds , we can compare the galaxies in other ways , namely via the abundances of certain sub - populations ; the most recent epoch of star formation ; and the contribution of intermediate - age stars to the total population .",
    "ngcs 205 , 185 and 147 do not show marked differences in their inferred median photometric abundances ( from colour information ) for ancient stars , which correspond to intermediate or richer values ( [ fe / h ] @xmath5 -1.1dex ) .",
    "however , both ngc 147 and ngc 185 have a sub - population of ancient stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath2 -1.5dex , based on the presence of a hb in each of them .",
    "the difference between these [ fe / h ] estimates ( i.e. , from the rgb colour and hb methods ) could be explained if each contains an ancient and or intermediate - age population of predominantly metal - rich stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath8 - 1.5dex .",
    "alternatively , the discrepancy may be resolved to some extent if extinction has been under - estimated .",
    "for example , based on the rgb colour[fe / h ] relation from lee et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , an under - estimation of our ngc 185 e(b - v ) data by 0.04mag , for example , leads to a more metal - rich abundance ( [ fe / h ] ) by about 0.2dex .",
    "accordingly , we conclude that the ancient stellar populations of the three galaxies appear to have broadly similar [ fe / h ] values ; but these need to be scrutinized by detailed future star formation history analyses and spectroscopy - based studies .    on the issue of the most recent epoch of star formation activity ,",
    "ngc 185 and ngc 147 differ markedly , in the sense that star formation occured more recently in ngc 185 ( @xmath4 4@xmath010@xmath1yr ago ) than in ngc 147 ( @xmath8 1gyr ago ; han et al .",
    "this is a restatement of the known crisis in explaining the differences in the ngc 147/ngc 185 pair ( mateo 1998 ) .",
    "for example , if gas origin in dwarf galaxies is largely internal ( via dying stars ) , and they are still capable of gas accumulation at the present epoch , there is the suggestion ( mateo 1998 ; his sec .",
    "4 ) from the lack of gas and recent star formation activity that ngc 147 has avoided accumulating gas since the last star formation episode(s ) .    for the intermediate - age population we probed whether their contribution varied significantly among the three galaxies .",
    "we inferred from an agb  rgb star count analysis that the contribution from stars that formed in the past several 10@xmath49yr is significantly greater in ngc 205 than in ngc 185 or ngc 147 .",
    "for ngc 147 the contribution is significantly greater than that in ngc 185 .",
    "as ngc 147 and ngc 185 are similar in terms of mass and size , an implication is that ngc 147 has had a markedly higher star formation rate at intermediate - age epochs , compared to that at older epochs , than in ngc 185 .",

    "<S> we present the first detailed analysis of resolved stellar populations in the dwarf galaxies ngc 185 and ngc 205 based on archival v- and i - band wfpc2 pointings .    for ngc 185 </S>",
    "<S> we deduce from the brightest main sequence and blue loop stars that star formation was probably still active about 4@xmath010@xmath1yr ago ; and have three key abundance - related results : ( 1 ) we identify ancient stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath2 -1.5dex by a well - defined horizontal branch ( hb ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) we find a prominent clump / bump - like feature along the red giant branch / faint asymptotic giant branch ( rgb / faint agb ) with the same mean v - band magnitude as in the hb , within uncertainties ( i.e. , @xmath3v(bump - hb ) = 0 ) ; from a comparison with theory , the implication is that ancient stars have [ fe / h ] @xmath4 -1.5dex , with a higher abundance level for intermediate - age stars . ( 3 ) from colour information we infer that median [ fe / h ] @xmath5 -1.11@xmath60.08dex for ancient stars ( assuming e(b - v ) = 0.18mag ) .    for ngc 205 , we record a new distance modulus , ( m - m)@xmath7 = 24.76@xmath60.1mag , taking e(b - v ) = 0.11mag , based on the red giant branch ( rgb ) tip magnitude method in i - band . </S>",
    "<S> we find that stars were probably still forming less than 3@xmath010@xmath1yr ago in ngc 205 , which is compatible with star formation triggered by an interaction with m31 . </S>",
    "<S> three key abundance - related results for ngc 205 are : ( 1 ) the red giant / faint - asymptotic giant branch is significantly skewed to redder values than that of a control field in the outskirts of m31 ; it probably results from a relatively narrow metallicity and or age range for a significant fraction of the dwarf s stars . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) from a comparison with models , the most metal - rich rgb stars reach to [ fe / h ] @xmath8 -0.7dex ( @xmath80.2z@xmath9 ) . </S>",

    "<S> we briefly compare the stellar populations of ngc 205 , ngc 185 and ngc 147 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we study several v- and r - band structural properties of the nuclear star cluster in ngc 205 for the first time : the apparent v-/r - band effective radii indicate a blue excess in the cluster s outer region . in terms of size , the cluster is like a typical galactic globular cluster or a nuclear cluster in a nearby late - type spiral galaxy ; but it is quite bright ( 10@xmath10l@xmath11 ) , unlike an ancient globular cluster , and by matching with models , the blue colour hints that its stellar population is young , up to a few times 10@xmath1yr old . </S>"
