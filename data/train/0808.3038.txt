    "another definition of an elliptic curve is that of a genus 1 curve .",
    "then , the riemann - roch theorem @xcite determines the dimensions of the riemann - roch spaces , from which a certain equation of degree 3 is obtained which can be simplified again .",
    "it is interesting that the generators of these spaces are then fixed up to products by constants .",
    "our goal in this paper is to generalize the concept of weierstrass nomal form for curves of higher genus , in such as a way as to also fix the generators of the riemann - roch spaces up to product by constants .",
    "the interest of such property lies in the fact that it allows to improve an algorithm by f. hess @xcite for computing the set of birational isomorphisms between two given algebraic curves .",
    "( if the two curves are equal , then the result is the automorphism group ; if not , then the algorithm decides whether the two curves are birationally equivalent . )    here is a summary of the main idea of hess s algorithm .",

    "an isomorphism has to take @xmath2 to a weierstrass point on the second curve with the same gap sequence .",
    "there are only finitely many such points , and we compute for each of them the set of isomorphisms mapping @xmath2 to it . these isomorphisms induce isomorphisms on corresponding riemann - roch spaces , and this fact allows one to compute the isomorphisms efficiently .",
    "it is surprising that the algorithm does not use the canonical embedding ; the reason is that the embedding based on weierstrass points leads to better complexity .",
    "hess s algorithm has been implemented in magma @xcite , and the algorithm is quite useful for practical computations when the coefficient field is finite .",
    "our improvement applies in the characteristic zero case .",
    "we show that the birational isomorphisms of two tschirnhaus - weierstrass curves mapping the unique point at infinity to the unique point at infinity can always be expressed as scalings of coordinates .",
    "the computation of these scalings is almost trivial .    as a side result",

    "( i)@xmath174(ii ) : : :    obvious . ( ii)@xmath175(iii ) : : :    it is clear that there must be at least one monomial of each possible    degree in @xmath170 .",

    "this would provide a non - trivial zero linear combination .",
    "( iii)@xmath175(i ) : : :    a polynomial in the quotient corresponds to a function with a pole at    @xmath73 of order de degree of the polynomial .",
    "the only    monomial of degree @xmath5 in @xmath170 also corresponds    to a function with a pole of order @xmath5 ; with a linear    combination of both we reduce the pole order . proceeding succesively",
    "we can cancel the pole completely , and the original polynomial is    expressed as a polynomial with monomials only in @xmath170 .        by theorem [ th : characterization of normal form sets ] and considering the relation between degrees and pole orders ,",
    "it is clear that every monomial of degree less than @xmath176 can be expressed as a linear combination of the normal forms that are smaller than @xmath177 .",

    "an additional property is desirable : since such a polynomial consists only of the monomial @xmath85 and normal forms , any monomial @xmath192 that is cancelled should also be a normal form ( if not , we are just trying to kill terms that are not there in the first place ) .",
    "next , a good monomial is chosen ; the while loop always ends , since in particular there always exists an integer @xmath205 such that @xmath206 , and then we can choose @xmath207 as the good monomial ( note that we can use this as a simpler way of finding a good monomial ) .    then , any monomial @xmath85 of sufficiently high degree will satisfy @xmath208 for all @xmath82 with @xmath209 , avoiding collisions with the already chosen normal forms . indeed , if @xmath210 then @xmath211 , and for all @xmath82 with @xmath209 we have that @xmath212 . in particular , none of these imposed normal forms is equal to @xmath85 and we can freely choose a normal form of degree @xmath213 other than @xmath85 , fulfilling all the conditions in definition [ def : good monomial ] .",
