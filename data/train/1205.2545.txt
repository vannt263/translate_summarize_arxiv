    "few classical dynamical systems are as simple or important as the one - dimensional damped harmonic oscillator : @xmath0 but the simplicity of this dynamical system does not survive the transition to quantum mechanics .",
    "the presence of dissipation in ( [ qdampf ] ) ( or amplification with @xmath1 ) leads to severe difficulties with its quantization , a problem that has attracted repeated investigation from the 1930s to the present day ( some historical information is given in @xcite ) .",
    "a brief account of the different approaches to quantizing ( [ qdampf ] ) will explain the rather straightforward , but crucial , respect in which the starting point of this paper differs from previous work .",
    "the central obstacle in quantizing the dynamics ( [ qdampf ] ) is that a hamiltonian is required that will generate the quantum time evolution ( a lagrangian will suffice for the path - integral approach ) .",
    "a lagrangian and hamiltonian exist that give the equation of motion ( [ qdampf ] ) , but they are time dependent because of the dissipation ( or amplification ) and this leads to difficulties in implementing the canonical commutation relation  @xcite . if the dissipated energy is included through extra dynamical degrees of freedom , then the problem of a time - dependent hamiltonian can be avoided .",
    "the simplest approach is to write a two - body hamiltonian describing one damped and one amplified oscillator , with conserved total energy  @xcite .",
    "but the canonical variables of this system  @xcite are not the positions and momenta of the two oscillators , so again there is no straightforward way of imposing canonical commutation relations on each oscillator  @xcite . in recent times",
    "the most popular approach is to treat a damped harmonic oscillator as a free oscillator coupled to a reservoir of oscillators of different frequencies .",
    "the apparently universal practice for investigations of the damped harmonic oscillator has been to use a discrete set of oscillators for the reservoir .",
    "the resulting form of the hamiltonian is attributed to magalinskii  @xcite , and it is also the most popular starting point for attempts to describe quantum brownian motion ( with a free particle coupled to the reservoir )  @xcite .",
    "this approach does not give the dynamics ( [ qdampf ] ) for the oscillator of interest , with a damping proportional to velocity ; instead , the oscillator equation of motion can be written with a term @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is an integral kernel dependent on the coupling to the reservoir  @xcite . in order to describe damping proportional to velocity , often called ohmic damping in view of the electrical application of ( [ qdampf ] ) , a limiting procedure @xmath4 must be employed at some point  @xcite .",
    "the limit that produces ohmic damping ( or amplification ) involves arbitrarily decreasing the frequency spacing between oscillators in the reservoir while maintaining reservoir oscillators of arbitrarily high frequencies ; in other words , the reservoir is effectively regarded as a continuum , but only after the dynamical equations have been solved under the assumption that the reservoir is a discrete set .",
    "the impossibility of achieving ohmic damping with a discrete reservoir and the emergence of ohmic damping through a delicate continuum limit , after the dynamics has been solved , is discussed in great detail by tatarskii  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the approaches just described , which seek to employ the standard quantization rules , there are phenomenological approaches to the damped harmonic oscillator where no rigorous quantization is attempted ( reference  @xcite is just one example of such approaches ) .",
    "the starting point of the results presented here is a harmonic oscillator coupled to a reservoir , where the latter is a continuum of oscillators of all positive frequencies .",
    "use of a continuum reservoir from the outset gives a much richer dynamical system compared to the use of a discrete reservoir .",
    "as the system we will be analyzing has an uncountable number of degrees of freedom , it acquires many of the properties of a field theory , and is qualitatively different from a countable set of coupled oscillators , even if the latter set is infinite .",
    "we will describe the general method for solving the dynamical system with a continuum reservoir and solve exactly the case of ohmic damping and amplification , which will emerge from a particular choice of coupling to the reservoir .",
    "the quantization for general damping and ohmic damping is treated in detail , including the diagonalization of the hamiltonian and the case of thermal equilibrium .",
    "the continuum reservoir appears to originate with huttner and barnett  @xcite , a paper that is very well known and yet whose technical innovation and importance have been under - appreciated .",
    "an example of what can be achieved with a continuum reservoir is the canonical quantization of the macroscopic maxwell equations for arbitrary media obeying the kramers - kronig relations  @xcite , including bi - anisotropic and moving media  @xcite . in the present paper the continuum reservoir",
    "will again show its power by allowing an exact treatment of the dynamics ( [ qdampf ] ) and its canonical quantization .",
    "more importantly , the continuum reservoir will naturally lead to the characterization of a quantum damped harmonic oscillator by an arbitrary effective susceptibility obeying kramers - kronig relations .",
    "because of this last property , the quantum damped harmonic oscillator will be found to have much in common with the quantum theory of light in macroscopic media .",
    "this offers a alternative framework for describing macroscopic quantum oscillators , which are now a subject of some remarkable experiments  @xcite . rather than attempting to capture the immensely complicated microscopic physics",
    ", the results in this paper suggest that macroscopic quantum oscillators may be describable by effective susceptibilities that are to be experimentally measured , just as the electromagnetic properties of macroscopic media are captured by measured permittivities and permeabilities .",
    "the price to be paid for employing the continuum reservoir is the extra mathematical complexity compared to the discrete case .",
    "many aspects of this mathematical apparatus , which provides an important and unusual addition to standard quantum field theory , have still not been fully explored . as well as treating the specific problem of the damped harmonic oscillator ,",
    "the results presented here give further insight into the remarkably rich classical and quantum physics of a continuum reservoir .",
    "section  [ sec : l ] gives the lagrangian and equations of motion of an oscillator coupled to a continuum reservoir .",
    "in sections  [ sec : solni ] and  [ sec : solnii ] the dynamics for a particular coupling that gives damping proportional to velocity is solved in detail .",
    "the system is quantized in section  [ sec : quantization ] and the diagonalization of the hamiltonian is addressed . in sections  [ sec : coh ] and  [ sec : thermal ] coherent - state solutions and thermal equilibrium are treated .",
    "possible applications and extensions of the results are discussed in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "we consider the dynamical system with lagrangian @xmath5 this describes a harmonic oscillator with displacement @xmath6 and frequency @xmath7 and a reservoir of oscillators with displacements @xmath8 and frequencies @xmath9 , with the @xmath6-oscillator linearly coupled to the reservoir by an arbitrary coupling function @xmath10 .",
    "we couple only displacements in ( [ l ] ) , not velocities , and the reservoir oscillators are not directly coupled to each other .",
    "the variables @xmath11 and @xmath12 are functions only of time , so the entire system may be viewed as located at one point in space",
    ". the dynamical variables in ( [ l ] ) are thus not _ fields _ in the conventional sense , but the dependence of @xmath12 on the continuous quantity @xmath13 will give this system many of the properties of a field theory , in sharp contrast to the case of a discrete reservoir .",
    "the total energy of the system described by ( [ l ] ) is @xmath14    the system ( [ l ] ) is close to being a drastic simplification of the huttner - barnett model  @xcite of a dielectric coupled to the electromagnetic field : if the electromagnetic field is removed along with the spatial dependence of the medium and the reservoir , then the huttner - barnett model almost reduces to the system ( [ l ] ) , the difference being that the @xmath6-oscillator would be coupled to @xmath15 rather than @xmath8 .",
    "the relationship of our system to the huttner - barnett model will be commented on at several points , as some of the technical achievements of huttner - barnett will be closely related to results here .",
    "the main differences from huttner - barnett , in addition to the simplifications just described , are that ( i ) we do not rely solely on a retarded or advanced solution of the reservoir dynamics , ( ii ) much of our time will be spent in obtaining the exact solution for a specific coupling function , whereas huttner and barnett consider only a general coupling function , and ( iii ) our coupling term is of a different form .    the euler - lagrange equations of ( [ l ] ) are @xmath16 the general solution of the reservoir equation ( [ xeq ] ) can be written @xmath17\\,e^{-0^+|t - t'| } ,",

    "we can impose arbitrary displacements @xmath19 and velocities @xmath20 on the reservoir at @xmath21 ( these are not  initial \" conditions because the solution ( [ xgensol ] ) is valid for all @xmath22 ) .",
    "the choice of @xmath21 is of course arbitrary , but no generality is lost by the form ( [ xgensol ] ) if we wish to impose conditions on the reservoir at some finite time ( the imposition of conditions in the infinite past or future is dealt with later in this section ) .",
    "the presence of the exponential in ( [ xgensol ] ) is important for taking the fourier transform of this general solution , and it can be understood as follows .",
    "solutions of ( [ xeq ] ) can be constructed using a green function @xmath23 defined by @xmath24 for example , the retarded @xmath25 and advanced @xmath26 green functions are @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the step function .",
    "the exponential factors are necessary in the green functions ( [ gr ] ) and ( [ ga ] ) for their fourier transforms to exist , and the infinitesimal number @xmath18 gives the familiar pole prescriptions in the frequency domain , with @xmath29 analytic in the upper - half complex @xmath13-plane and @xmath30 analytic in the lower - half plane . the general solution ( [ xgensol ] )",
    "is constructed with the difference @xmath31 which is a solution of the homogeneous version of ( [ geq ] ) ( i.e.  ( [ geq ] ) without the delta function ) .",
    "this gives the exponential factor in ( [ xgensol ] ) that is required to define the fourier transform of @xmath12 .    to complete the solution for the dynamics we must substitute ( [ xgensol ] ) into ( [ qeq ] ) and solve the resulting equation for @xmath11 : @xmath32\\,e^{-0^+|t - t'| } \\nonumber \\\\ -\\int_0^\\infty\\rmd\\omega\\,\\alpha(\\omega)\\left\\{\\frac{1}{2}\\left[a_0(\\omega)+\\rmi b_0(\\omega)\\right]\\exp(-\\rmi\\omega t)+\\mathrm{c.c.}\\right\\}=0 .",

    "it turns out that for a constant ( i.e.  frequency - independent ) coupling @xmath39 , the time and frequency integrations do _ not _ commute , but this case of constant coupling is easily solved in the time domain . for ( [ qinteq ] ) to be valid the coupling function must also be such that the integral containing @xmath40 converges .",
    "needless to say , it must always be directly verified , regardless of the solution method employed , that the dynamical equations ( [ qeq ] ) and ( [ xeq ] ) are satisfied .",
    "once a coupling function @xmath10 and the @xmath21 state of the reservoir are chosen , ( [ qinteq ] ) presents a principal - value integral equation for @xmath36 , also known as a singular integral equation . in the standard classification , ( [ qinteq ] )",
    "is an inhomogeneous singular integral equation of the third kind .",
    "there is a systematic and very elegant method of solving singular integral equations , which exploits some complex analysis of riemann and hilbert  @xcite .",
    "integral equations such as ( [ qinteq ] ) are solved by relating the equation to a boundary problem of the theory of analytic functions , usually called a riemann problem but sometimes called a hilbert problem  @xcite .",

    "we refer the reader to pipkin s text  @xcite for the details , which are too lengthy to be described here ( the classic text of muskhelishvili  @xcite does not appear to treat directly equations on an infinite interval ) .",
    "the following additional remarks on the dynamical equations are worthwhile .",
    "note that for any coupling function for which ( [ qinteq ] ) is valid , we can insert any function @xmath41 and solve for @xmath42 and @xmath43 , provided the integral involving @xmath36 converges .",
    "in other words , we can _ choose _ the dynamics of the @xmath6-oscillator from an enormous class of functions @xmath11 whose fourier transforms exist , and use ( [ qinteq ] ) to find the values of the displacements and velocities of the reservoir at @xmath21 that will produce this dynamics @xmath11 .",
    "it must be borne in mind that there may well be solutions @xmath11 , @xmath12 whose fourier transforms do not exist ; for example , there is no mathematical reason why the function @xmath11 should be bounded .",
    "even if @xmath44 exists for a solution @xmath11 , it can only be found by solving ( [ qinteq ] ) if the integral containing @xmath44 is well defined .",
    "transformation to the frequency domain is an essential part of diagonalizing the hamiltonian , which in turn gives the most convenient description of quantum states of the system .",
    "but there is no guarantee that the diagonalized hamiltonian will give all the dynamical solutions of the original hamiltonian , and moreover there are couplings for which the hamiltonian can not be diagonalized ( see section  [ sec : quantization ] ) .",
    "it is already clear that our dynamical system is completely different from that in which the continuum reservoir is replaced by a discrete one .",
    "the analysis of dynamical systems consisting of a discrete number of coupled harmonic oscillators is largely a matter of algebra  @xcite . in our case",
    "the mathematics is more challenging and this is because the dynamics is much richer . the possible couplings @xmath10 constitute the entire space of real functions , rather than a discrete set of numbers .",
    "moreover , for some coupling functions @xmath10 , the existence of a solution of ( [ qinteq ] ) requires severe constraints on the functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 , whereas for other coupling functions there will be no such constraints  @xcite .",
    "the general mathematical theory also shows that there is a subspace of coupling functions for which ( [ qinteq ] ) gives only the trivial solution @xmath45 when @xmath46  @xcite , although it is by no means clear what this subspace is .",
    "it would be very interesting to know how the space of solutions behaves as a functional of coupling @xmath10 , but that is far beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we will however find a constraint on the coupling function that must be satisfied for the hamiltonian to be diagonalizable .",
    "in addition to the form ( [ xgensol ] ) , we also require the general solution of the reservoir equation ( [ xeq ] ) in a form that allows the imposition of conditions in the infinite past or future .",

    "but most mechanical oscillators do not exhibit a  free \" oscillation state ; the oscillation degree of freedom is produced by the same material geometry that causes damping .",
    "this means that the parameter @xmath7 can not be separated from the susceptibility , and they must together be fitted to a given system through experimental measurement . a choice of @xmath7 for which @xmath243 may therefore not be restrictive",

    "if @xmath7 has no direct physical meaning one can effectively make the same redefinition with the coupling term chosen here , through the joint characterization of @xmath7 and the susceptibility @xmath189 .",
    "the considerations in this paper are of course only a first step towards describing physical quantum oscillators , and other ingredients would have to be included such as coupling to light in the case of opto - mechanical systems . there is also the crucial question of how the effective susceptibility is to be measured for real oscillators , or how physically realistic susceptibilities could be deduced from simple microscopic considerations , as is done in electromagnetism . in regard to this last point , damping proportional to velocity would not be expected to be physically relevant . while the dynamics ( [ qdampf ] ) may be a reasonable description , for small @xmath80 , of a free oscillator in a fluid , nano - oscillators with mechanical damping determined by the particular material geometry would not experience a simple damping proportional to velocity .",

    "the infinitesimal number @xmath18 in ( [ g1])([g2 ] ) regularizes its fourier transform in @xmath22 , giving the @xmath110 of ( [ gfreq1])([gfreq2 ] ) .",
    "here we complete the final steps in diagonalizing the hamiltonian . in section  [ sec : quantization ] we constructed a transformation , given by ( [ qfc1])([qfc3 ] ) , ( [ fxsol ] ) , ( [ fqsol ] ) and ( [ hx ] ) , that will diagonalize the hamiltonian provided the commutation relations ( [ cancom1 ] ) and ( [ cancom2 ] ) are satisfied by ( [ qfc1])([qfc3 ] ) . inserting ( [ qfc1])([qfc3 ] ) into ( [ cancom1 ] ) and ( [ cancom2 ] ) , and using ( [ ccom ] ) , we obtain the final non - trivial conditions on the @xmath163-coefficients for the diagonalizing transformation : @xmath254 the last two of these conditions are easily seen to hold because of ( [ fxsol ] ) and the first of ( [ fpifx ] ) .",
    "we proceed to show that the first two conditions , i.e.  ( [ fcon1 ] ) and ( [ fcon2 ] ) , hold for coupling functions satisfying ( [ alclass ] ) and ( [ alcondiag ] ) , a class that includes the coupling function ( [ alpar ] ) corresponding to damping proportional to velocity . the following analysis has an exact counterpart in the huttner - barnett model  @xcite , although the results are different due to a different type of coupling between the @xmath6-oscillator and the reservoir .",
    "consider first the condition ( [ fcon1 ] ) .",
    "if we insert the first of ( [ fpifq ] ) together with ( [ fqsol ] ) into ( [ fcon1 ] ) , we encounter a term quadratic in @xmath174 . as noted after ( [ hqeq ] )",
    ", a non - zero @xmath174 will contain a delta function , so to avoid a square of a delta function in ( [ fcon1 ] ) we are forced to choose the solution @xmath255 of ( [ hqeq ] ) .",
    "the condition ( [ fcon1 ] ) is then , with use of ( [ hx ] ) , @xmath256 this complicated restriction on the coupling function @xmath10 is a requirement for the hamiltonian to be diagonalizable . for a very broad class of coupling functions",
    "however , ( [ alcongen ] ) reduces to a much simpler requirement .",
    "if @xmath40 is an even function of @xmath13 then ( [ alcongen ] ) can be written @xmath257 the assumption that @xmath40 is an even function also implies that the combination @xmath258 which appears in the denominator in ( [ alevencon ] ) , is analytic on the upper - half complex @xmath13-plane .",
    "this follows from the familiar analysis of susceptibilities that are analytic on the upper - half frequency plane and that therefore obey kramers - kronig relations  @xcite ; the real and imaginary parts of ( [ sus ] ) exhibit one of the kramers - kronig relations for a complex susceptibility , provided @xmath40 is an even function of @xmath13 .",
    "if we further assume that @xmath259 except possibly at @xmath57 , then it is shown in  @xcite that the  susceptibility \" ( [ sus ] ) does not take real values at any finite point in the upper - half complex @xmath13-plane except on the imaginary axis , where it varies monotonically from its value at @xmath260 to its value at @xmath261 . moreover , the ( real ) value of ( [ sus ] ) on the positive imaginary axis @xmath262 , @xmath263 , is  @xcite @xmath264 we now consider the analytic properties of the integrand in ( [ alevencon ] ) in the upper - half frequency plane . as ( [ sus ] )",
    "is real in the upper - half plane only on the positive imaginary axis , the denominator in ( [ alevencon ] ) can vanish only at positive imaginary frequencies @xmath262 , where it has the value ( using ( [ susim ] ) ) @xmath265 it is clear that ( [ denim ] ) has a zero if and only if @xmath266 if the equality holds in ( [ denzero ] ) then ( [ denim ] ) has a zero at @xmath267 , but this does not give a pole in the integrand in ( [ alevencon ] ) unless ( [ denim ] ) goes as @xmath268 , @xmath269 , as @xmath270 .",
    "there are therefore no poles in the integrand in ( [ alevencon ] ) in the upper - half plane if and only if @xmath271 if ( [ alconapp ] ) holds then the integral in ( [ alevencon ] ) is equal to minus the integral over an infinite semi - circle in the upper - half plane .",
    "taking @xmath272 , @xmath273 , @xmath274 as the integration parameter along the infinite semi - circle , we find that the integral in ( [ alevencon ] ) is @xmath275 , so that ( [ alevencon ] ) is satisfied .",
    "there remains the condition ( [ fcon2 ] ) .",
    "we must substitute the first of ( [ fpifx ] ) , ( [ fxsol ] ) , ( [ fqsol ] ) , ( [ hq0 ] ) and ( [ hx ] ) .",
    "this gives an integral relation that is again easy to evaluate for coupling functions for which @xmath40 is an even function of @xmath13 and @xmath259 except possibly at @xmath57 .",
    "evaluation of the integral by closing the countour in the upper - half plane shows that the integral relation holds without restrictions on the coupling function beyond those already derived from ( [ fcon1 ] ) .",
    "this analysis completes the proof that the hamiltonian is diagonalizable for the class of coupling functions ( [ alclass ] ) if and only if ( [ alcondiag ] ) holds .",
