    "spin qubits have generated a lot of interest recently in systems of single , double quantum dots ( dqds),@xcite triple quantum dots ( tqds),@xcite and two coupled dqds.@xcite    frequently probabilities are obtained from averaging thousands of individual measurements , with each measurement separated by an initialization pulse . for example , to initialize into a singlet state a pulse can be applied to an appropriate location in the stability diagram where a dot electron will be replaced by one from the leads with the appropriate spin ( see , for instance , the supplementary information from ref .",
    "such initialization pulses can also be used in larger tqd systems,@xcite but it is expected to be more difficult to continue implementing this technique in more complex quantum dot circuits due to the isolation of the inner dot electrons .",

    "the other features , including the lower yellow line , pertain to the presence of the pulse and will be described in the next section .",
    "the experiments involve the creation of a superposition by passage through an anticrossing ( analogous to a beam splitter ) , phase evolution , completing the interferometer by passing through the anticrossing a second time and then reading out the state .",
    "the required anticrossing occurs naturally in the scheme .",
    "the state of two electrons in the ( 2,0 ) or ( 1,1 ) electronic configurations can either be a spin 0 singlet or a spin 1 triplet . as a result of the magnetic field applied along the z direction and the sign of the electron g - factor in gaas ,",

    "this anticrossing between the s and  states originates from spinflips mediated by the hyperfine interaction between the electron spins and the host lattice nuclear spins.@xcite the confined electron spins experience an effective overhauser magnetic field originating from the lattice nuclei .",
    "this is slightly different for electrons in the two dots , purely from statistical considerations , resulting in overhauser field gradients .",
    "the interaction at the anticrossing is proportional to @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the g - factor of conduction electrons in gaas , @xmath22 is the bohr magneton , and @xmath23 is the overhauser field gradient perpendicular to the applied magnetic field .    the initial diabatic transition probability between the two eigenstates of the s-  anticrossing , when applying a pulse which detunes the system through the anticrossing from ( 2,0 ) to ( 1,1 ) , is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is planck s constant and @xmath26 and @xmath27 refer to the eigenenergies of the two states involved in the s-  anticrossing.@xcite the key to creating a quantum superposition between s and  is to allow the detuning to change at the appropriate speed , for which the landau - zener probability differs from zero . if the detuning changes extremely slowly , @xmath28 as for an adiabatic process , while if the detuning changes extremely fast , @xmath29=1 as for a fully diabatic process .    once a quantum superposition is created , the relative phase difference @xmath30 between the two eigenstates is given by the time integral of the detuning - dependent energy difference between these states , i.e.  @xmath31 . at fixed initial detuning ,",
    "increasing the pulse duration would lead to oscillations in the probability of finding either spin state , as @xmath30 increases linearly with the time spent at the end of the pulse in the ( 1,1 ) region . in this paper",
    "we vary the initial detuning while holding the pulse duration constant .",
    "the pulse duration of 16  ns was determined mainly by limitations due to the decoherence time  ( which lies in the 5 - 15  ns range here ) and the chosen pulse rise time ( 8  ns ) .",
    "the formula for @xmath30 still applies in the case of fixed pulse duration .",
    "as the initial detuning increases , the pulse goes further in the ( 1,1 ) region past the s-  anticrossing , the energy difference @xmath32 increases , and therefore the relative phase @xmath30 grows .",
    "this leads to oscillations in the probability of finding either spin state as a function of detuning .",
    "this describes the phase accumulation near the top part of the pulse , at largest detuning .",
    "this process needs to be integrated everywhere the pulse is past the anticrossing . ideally @xmath29 would be @xmath330.5 for optimum superposition . for the pulse and statistical inhomogeneous field gradient in these experiments , the initial value for @xmath29 after passing through the anticrossing is , however , approximately @xmath3395% . the final part of the applied pulse detunes the system back through the anticrossing .",
    "@xmath29 will once again change the quantum superposition of the already superposed states .",
    "in theory , it would be possible to apply a more complex train of pulses prior to commencing the phase evolution experiment to improve the degree of initial superposition , but the experiments and theory in this paper involve superpositions created by single pulses .    in the case of the s-  anticrossing , the charge detector can not distinguish the two spin states in the ( 1,1 ) region , as the underlying charge state is the same for both states .",
    "however , on passage through the anticrossing a second time and into the ( 2,0 ) region of the stability diagram , the s component evolves smoothly to the ( 2,0 ) ground state , while   remains in the excited state with a ( 1,1 ) charge configuration since the triplet ( 2,0 ) is not energetically accessible .",
    "thus after the pulse is complete , at the measurement point m in the ( 2,0 ) region , the resulting spin state information can be converted into charge information , a process referred to as spin - to - charge conversion,@xcite as the spin states map to different charge states there . the charge detector ( a nearby quantum point contact )",
    "makes a measurement by effectively projecting the spin state on the s and  basis states . in practice ,",
    "the qpc conductance is averaged over @xmath3310@xmath34 identical pulses .",
    "the probability of returning in s after such an experiment depends upon many factors such as the effectiveness of the landau - zener process , the relaxation time , and decoherence time of the system .",
    "certain reported experiments have utilized an initialization step before every measurement in the averaged collection ( e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) by adding a preliminary pulse toward one of the addition lines in the ( 2,0 ) region prior to the detuning pulse described above .",
    "this allows for an exchange of an electron between the dot and the lead to achieve the desired singlet state .",
    "we call these is experiments to differentiate them from experiments where there is no such pulse ( nis ) . in the latter case",
    "the resulting state at the end of the measurement is used as a starting point of the next pulse .",
    "the statistics over many pulses will still oscillate as a function of detuning . in this paper",
    ", we compare these two procedures .    we can infer the position of the s-  anticrossing in the stability diagram from the position of the lower horizontal yellow line in the ( 2,0 ) region of the stability diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) .",
    "when the measurement point m is on this yellow line , the tip of the pulse p reaches the s-  anticrossing . above this yellow line",

    "[ fig:1](b , d ) ] .",

    "[ fig:1](b ) , the qpc conductance data are numerically differentiated with respect to the  gate voltage for an improved presentation . in all other graphs",
    "the qpc conductance data are normalized relative to the conductance step at the charge transfer line between ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,0 ) to get a probability of return in state s between 0 and 1 .",

    "( b ) calculated p(s ) vs.  initial detuning for hyperfine splitting @xmath35=0.2  @xmath7ev of the is case ( red ) .",
    "the blue curve is the nis case from the average over 1000 pulse repeats .",
    "the green dashed curve is nis derived from is ( see text).,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]",
    "throughout the paper we distinguish data with an initialization step and without initialization step .",
    "let us explain what this means from the point of view of the calculations and the experiments",
    ". in the calculations , no initialization step ( nis ) means that the final result for p(s ) is the probability averaged over 1000 pulse sequences , where the final state ( s or ) determined after any given pulse is the starting state for the next pulse . in the calculation , what we call the initialization step ( or is ) is just the resulting p(s ) after the first pulse , where the initial conditions prior to the pulse have been set theoretically to the singlet state .",
    "experimentally , no initialization step ( nis ) means we only apply the gaussian - convoluted pulses and no other pulses.@xcite    the nis repeat pulse scheme is simulated theoretically with the following model based on the solution of the time dependent density matrix.@xcite the system is initialized in the s state after which the first pulse is applied . during the measurement cycle the population is allowed to partially relax to the ground state with a decay time . at the end of each pulse cycle",
    "the state vector is then projected onto the charge basis to yield either s or  occupation , which then defines the initial state for the next pulse cycle . as in experiment , p(s ) is obtained as the fraction of measurements that find the system in the s state . typically 1000 such cycles provide sufficient statistics to model the effects of relaxation and initial state variation ( typical experimental sequences involve @xmath36 pulses ) .",
    "since the measurement time after each pulse had a duration much greater than the pulse itself it was found impractical to include the measurement segment in the simulation . by the same token ,",
    "however , almost all of the relaxation occurs during this measurement time when no other relevant time variation is present .",
    "thus , the @xmath37 decay was not included explicitly in the density matrix and was instead added by means of an exponential term prior to each projection operation .    a typical 1000 cycle repeat of the calculated p(s ) vs.  initial detuning scan is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) for a low value of @xmath6/@xmath330.1 , where consequences of relaxation are less important , and a hyperfine splitting @xmath38=0.2  @xmath7ev , consistent with experimentally measured values for the hyperfine splitting.@xcite for a given initial detuning , the vertical axis shows the result of each consecutive measurement .",
    "for the same parameters , fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) shows the is case from the first pulse response in red , and the nis case from the averaged probability over 1000 pulses in blue [ averaging over the vertical direction in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) ] .",
    "it is instructive to derive the nis result from the single pulse ( is ) curve for p(s ) using an iterative approach .",
    "here p(s ) serves as the starting estimate of the nis probability of being measured in s. due to symmetry it is also the probability , we call it p in this role , of a single pulse leaving the system in the state it started in , whether that state be s or . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( 1 ) , the probability of diabatic transition depends only on the time derivative of the energy spacing and not on the choice of initial state ( s or ) .",
    "likewise ( 1-p ) is the probability of a single pulse switching the final state from that in which it started . under nis conditions",
    "we can write a self - consistent condition for the total probability of measurement in the s state as the sum of the probability of starting in the s state and staying there after another pulse plus the probability of starting in the  state and then switching during the pulse : @xmath39(1 - \\mbox{p})\\ ] ] where @xmath40$]@xmath41 accounts for the decay from  to s over the pulse sequence .",
    "this has an analytic solution for the nis averaged probability of returning in s as @xmath42    where p is the single pulse curve ( red curve in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) ) .",
    "the iterative formulation in the above analysis is a mathematical construction not to be confused with pulse repeats . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) , the statistical distribution of the pulse measurements in the numerical simulations do not vary from pulse to pulse .",
    "the above procedure gives the green dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) which agrees well with the 1000 pulse repeat result .",
    "it also provides insight into the form of the nis curve .",
    "note , for example , that the expression for p(s ) will always produce a value between 0.5 and 1.0 , even from a p(s ) minimum below 0.5 , as in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) . for p=1 we get p(s)=1 ; for p=0 we get p(s)=1/(1+@xmath41 ) which gives 0.5 for small @xmath6/  and 1 for large @xmath6/ , i.e.  p(s ) lies between 0.5 and 1 . more generally , when @xmath6/   is small , the result is always 0.5 for any value of p not exactly equal to 1 .",
    "thus , a cosine - like form for the single pulse p leads to a non - cosine - like nis probability peaking sharply and having values @xmath430.5 .    the oscillations in the is case of fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) appear to become damped as initial detuning increases .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath29 is optimal to create a superposition only near the s-  anticrossing . at detunings",
    "further away from the anticrossing , @xmath29@xmath3395% and the superposition contains less and less of  hence the higher measured values of p(s ) . to first order ,",
    "the detuning period of the oscillations , @xmath44 ( in mv ) , along the detuning axis ( i.e. along the @xmath45 axis ) is inversely proportional to @xmath46 at the peak of the pulse ( where most of the phase difference is accumulated ) .",
    "the detuning dependence of @xmath32 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](d ) .",
    "for instance , over detuning ranges where the eigenstates change approximately linearly with @xmath45 , the derivative will be a constant , so @xmath44 is constant .",
    "therefore , equally spaced fringes along the detuning axis are expected as a function of detuning where @xmath32 varies approximately linearly with @xmath45 ( i.e. some distance away from the anticrossing ) .    the most prominent feature in the nis case shown in fig .  [ fig:2](b )",
    "is that in narrow regions around where p(s)=1 in the is case ( red curve ) , the pulse averaged probability in the nis case ( blue curve ) remains near unity .",
    "this is because the singlet that is measured after the first pulse becomes the initial and final state for all subsequent pulses so p(s)@xmath331 .",
    "as the detuning is moved away from these points , the projection operation introduces more statistical cases where p(s)=0 , and , in the regions where p(s ) is a minimum in the is case , the minimum in the nis case broadens and approaches 0.5 at this low @xmath6/@xmath330.1 . for the first minimum in the is case that drops below 0.5 , the probability in the nis case is noisier but again averages towards 0.5 ( the statistical average of these pure  and s results after each pulse leads to p(s)@xmath330.5 ) .",
    "this is true independently of detuning , so there is little appreciable damping in the p(s ) minima along the detuning axis in the nis case .",
    "the visibility of the lzs oscillations in p(s ) is expected to depend on the choice of pulse period @xmath6  and on the value of  at the measurement point.@xcite a few periods of lzs oscillations vs.  initial detuning and @xmath6  are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](a ) .",
    "these oscillations are obtained by using a single gaussian - convoluted rectangular pulse of a constant amplitude.@xcite the peak amplitude of each lzs oscillation decreases as @xmath6  increases due to the spin relaxation time .",
    "we extract  as the value of @xmath6  where the peak amplitude decreases to 37% of its maximum value .",
    "we find that   grows from 20  @xmath7s to 60  @xmath7s as initial detuning becomes more negative in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](a ) . because the spectrum of excited states changes with detuning as the dqd potential is deformed by the gate voltages , the inelastic decay mechanisms for the states also change ,",

    "the visibility and the relaxation time can both be affected by dynamical nuclear polarization ( dnp ) .",
    "the interplay between visibility , relaxation time , and pulse rise time has been investigated recently in a dqd , where dnp pulses were applied to increase the value of @xmath54 due to hyperfine nuclear interaction.@xcite even though we do not specifically apply a dnp pulse sequence here prior to the qubit manipulation pulse , we know from ref .",
    "@xcite that this pulse results in a small dnp effect in our samples .",
    "dnp may also account for some visible difference between experimental and theoretical graphs in fig .",

    "[ fig:3](b ) . even though dnp effects are beyond this study , the presented theory correctly captures the main experimental features discussed above .",
    "in conclusion , we have carried out the experimental and theoretical study of the microscopic mechanisms affecting the visibility of landau - zener - stckelberg oscillations in conditions where an initialization step is difficult .",
    "the results apply to cases where one of the dots is isolated from the leads ( e.g. the center dot of a triple quantum dot ) or where the relaxation time  is too short ( as for charge qubits ) .",
    "partial initialization occurs in these situations due to the  relaxation process during the qubit readout step .",
    "the visibility depends on the ratio of pulse period @xmath6  to the relaxation time ; it reaches a broad maximum at an optimum point , which depends on system parameters . in our experiment",
    "the lzs visibility reaches a maximum of 0.25 at the optimal @xmath6/@xmath330.2 in good agreement with theoretical calculations .",
    "theoretical analysis shows that in some cases ( for smaller hyperfine interactions ) the visibility without initialization step can exceed the one with the initialization .",
    "it is important to find optimal settings for @xmath6/  that can also be be used for the estimation of  or the level coupling at the anticrossing .",
