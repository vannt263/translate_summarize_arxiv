    "a number of papers have considered in recent years , the feedback control of systems governed by the laws of quantum mechanics rather than systems governed by the laws of classical mechanics ; e.g. , see @xcite . in particular , the papers @xcite consider a framework of quantum systems defined in terms of a triple @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a scattering matrix of operators , @xmath2 is a vector of coupling operators and @xmath3 is a hamiltonian operator .",
    "all operators are on an underlying hilbert space .",
    "the paper @xcite considers a quantum system defined by a triple @xmath0 such that the quantum system hamiltonian is written as @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 is a known nominal hamiltonian and @xmath6 is a perturbation hamiltonian , which is contained in a set of hamiltonians @xmath7 .",
    "the paper @xcite considers a problem of absolute stability for such uncertain quantum systems for the case in which the nominal hamiltonian @xmath5 is a quadratic function of annihilation and creation operators and the coupling operator vector @xmath2 is a linear function of annihilation and creation operators . such as nominal quantum system",
    "is said to be a linear quantum system ; e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "however , the perturbation hamiltonian @xmath6 is assumed to be contained in a set of non - quadratic hamiltonians corresponding to a sector bounded nonlinearity .",
    "then , the paper @xcite obtains a frequency domain robust stability result .",
    "extensions of the approach of @xcite can be found in the papers @xcite in which similar robust stability results are of obtain for uncertain quantum systems with different classes of uncertainty and different applications to specific quantum systems . also , in the paper @xcite a problem of robust performance analysis as well as robust stability analysis is considered .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the results of @xcite by considering a problem of robust performance analysis with a non - quadratic cost functional for the class of uncertain quantum systems of the form considered in @xcite .",
    "the motivation for considering robust performance of a quantum system with a non - quadratic cost function arises from the fact that the presence of nonlinearities in the quantum system allows for the possibility of a non - gaussian system state ; e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "such non - gaussian system states include important non - classical states such as the schrdinger cat state ( also known as a superposition state , e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "these non - classical quantum states are useful in areas such as quantum information and quantum communications ; e.g. , see @xcite . the presence of such non - classical states can be verified by obtaining a suitable bound on a non - quadratic cost function ( such as the wigner function , e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "our approach to obtaining a bound on the non - quadratic cost function is to extend the sector bound method considered in @xcite to bound both the nonlinearity and non - quadratic cost function together .",
    "it is important that these two quantities are bounded together since the non - gaussian state only arises due to the presence of the nonlinearity in the quantum system dynamics .",
    "then , by applying a similar approach to that in @xcite we are able to derive a guaranteed upper bound on the non - quadratic cost function in terms of an lmi problem . in order to illustrate this result ,",
    "it is applied to an example of a quantum system consisting of a josephson junction in an electromagnetic cavity .",
    "the robust stability of a similar system was previously considered in the paper @xcite . in this paper , we consider the robust performance of this system with respect to a non - quadratic cost functional",
    ".    a future application of the robust performance analysis approach proposed in this paper would be to use it to develop a method for the design of coherent quantum feedback controllers for quantum systems to achieve a certain closed loop performance bound in terms of a non - quadratic cost functional .",
    "in such a coherent quantum feedback control scheme both the plant and controller are quantum systems ; e.g. , see @xcite",
