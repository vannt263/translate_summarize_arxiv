    "<S> even if @xmath15 is fixed to its standard model value , at a considerable cost in @xmath16 , the lep  1 measurement of @xmath3 still disagrees with the standard model at the level of 3 standard deviations . </S>",
    "<S> it may well be that the apparent discrepancy is in fact due to a misestimation of the uncertainties associated with the simulation of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 final states , but it has been seductive to speculate that some new physics beyond the standard model may be coming into play .    </S>",
    "<S> one such speculation has been supersymmetry @xcite , and two specific scenarios to explain the @xmath3 discrepancy ( but not the @xmath15 one ) have been proposed . </S>",
    "<S> one has invoked a light chargino @xmath17 and a light top - squark @xmath18 close to the kinematic limits already excluded by new particle searches at lep  1 @xcite , and the other a light pseudoscalar higgs boson @xmath19 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these have inspired the hope in some quarters that one or more of these supersymmetric particles might be produced at lep  2 , and conceivably already in the intermediate - energy lep  1.5 run recently completed . </S>",
    "<S> it should be pointed out , though , that it is has proved difficult in specific models to obtain a supersymmetric contribution to @xmath3 large enough to remove the apparent discrepancy , once one applies plausible phenomenological or theoretical constraints @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> preliminary results of the first part of the lep  1.5 run have now been announced by the four lep collaborations , and , to paraphrase sherlock holmes ,  the curious incident was that the dog did nothing \" . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , all the four lep collaborations have reported preliminary lower limits on the mass of the lighter chargino @xcite : @xmath20 if @xmath21 ( with some dependence on the sneutrino mass ) , where the @xmath22 is the lightest neutralino , which is assumed to be the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) . </S>",
    "<S> many people are aware that this news is particularly disappointing for advocates of the light ( @xmath23 ) interpretation of the @xmath3 anomaly . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this note is to quantify the upper limit on the possible supersymmetric contribution to @xmath3 in the light of this preliminary lep  1.5 result , as well as recent d0 constraints on the @xmath18 mass and updates of other experimental constraints on possible sparticle masses , limits on possible new physics effects in @xmath24 and @xmath25 decay , and the absence of the lightest supersymmetric higgs boson .    to set the scene for our study , we first recall that the standard model contribution to @xmath3 ( for @xmath26 ) is @xmath27 @xcite , whereas the reported experimental value ( with @xmath15 constrained to the standard model value ) is @xmath28 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this means that a value of @xmath29 would bring the supersymmetric @xmath3 prediction within the 95% c.l . </S>",
    "<S> interval , whilst a contribution @xmath30 would bring the prediction within one sigma of the experimental value .    in this note we consider the supersymmetric contributions to @xmath3 in the regime of light chargino and top - squark masses and small values of @xmath31 , where they may be enhanced @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> enhancements to @xmath32 may also occur for small values of the pseudoscalar higgs mass ( @xmath33 ) and large values of @xmath31 @xcite , but this scenario now appears to be disfavored @xcite , and we do not consider it in what follows . </S>",

    "<S> ] to @xmath34 then depends on six parameters : those that parametrize the chargino sector ( @xmath36 ) , the top - squark masses ( @xmath37 ) , and their mixing angle ( @xmath38 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we work in the context of the general minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , without assuming _ a priori _ any relationship among these parameters that might result from unification conditions or dynamical models .    </S>",
    "<S> following ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we first sample a large number of six - plet choices of parameters , with those parameters that have the dimension of mass allowed to take random values in the interval @xmath39 , and with @xmath31 restricted to the range @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the total sample of approximately 365k six - plets is restricted in such a way that the most elementary lep  1 lower bounds ( @xmath41 ) are satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> we then find a total of 1000 six - plets that yield @xmath29 . to examine in more detail the region of low values of @xmath31 , </S>",
    "<S> we have also generated and studied a  </S>",
    "<S> low-@xmath31 \" sample ( 91k six - plets ) , for which @xmath31 is restricted to the range @xmath42 .    in order to determine the upper bound on @xmath34 </S>",
    "<S> , we apply a series of experimental constraints to our large six - plet sample , as follows :    1 .   the invisible @xmath43 width should be less than 3.9  mev , as can be inferred from the most recent lep result @xmath44  mev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   the branching ratio @xmath45 should not exceed @xmath46 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> the more restrictive lep  1 lower limit on the chargino mass : @xmath47 , valid for @xmath48 and for the higgsino - like chargino @xcite required for an enhancement in @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> 4 .   the lightest higgs boson should be heavier than the lep  1 limit ( @xmath49 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of this higgs boson acquires a large quantum correction at the one - loop level , which is dominated by the top  top - squark loop @xcite . casting the one - loop correction in terms of the observable top - squark parameters ( @xmath50 ) alone </S>",

    "<S> other one - loop corrections and the largest of the two - loop corrections are not expected to be large @xcite , and are probably no larger than uncertainties in the approximations used , so we do not incorporate them . </S>",
    "<S> 5 .   </S>",
    "<S> the branching ratio @xmath56 should fall in the range @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> this interval is a conservative interpretation of the latest cleo result @xmath58 @xcite , which should cover the theoretical uncertainties in the calculation of @xmath56 , principally due to higher - order perturbative qcd corrections in the standard model contribution . </S>",
    "<S> 6 .   </S>",
    "<S> the branching ratio @xmath59 has been determined by cdf to be @xmath60 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore require @xmath61 , where  new \" includes in our case the @xmath62 decay channels , when kinematically allowed . </S>",
    "<S> more restrictive upper limits on @xmath63 have been considered elsewhere @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> 7 .   </S>",
    "<S> the d0 collaboration has included a region in the @xmath64 space , assuming that @xmath65 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these restrictions insure that the dominant @xmath18 decay mode is via the one - loop process @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> 8 .   </S>",
    "<S> the new lep  1.5 lower limit on the chargino mass @xmath67 , valid as long as @xmath68 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a more precise formulation of the limit must await the publication of their results by the lep collaborations : it depends on the sneutrino mass and on the wino / higgsino content of the chargino . </S>",
    "<S> it seems to us that the above limit is conservative , applying when the sneutrino is heavy , or when the chargino is higgsino - like , which is the case of relevance for obtaining a large value of @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss later the effect of decreasing the restriction on the chargino - neutralino mass difference to about 5 gev , as might be achieved in the final analysis .    motivated by the requirement that any stable supersymmetric relic particle should be electromagnetically neutral and </S>",
    "<S> have no strong interactions @xcite , we also require that neither the lightest top - squark nor the lightest chargino should be the lightest supersymmetric particle , , @xmath69 .    after running our large sample of six - plets through the above set of experimental and theoretical constraints , we find that no points with @xmath70 survive . the main reason for this result is the new lep  1.5 constraint on the chargino mass . </S>",
    "<S> this could have been anticipated , as refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which did not have access to the new data , found regions of parameter space with @xmath70 , even after enforcing most of the constraints enumerated above . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that a supersymmetric solution to the @xmath3 anomaly is less likely in the light of lep  1.5 . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion holds for both our  regular \" sample and our  low-@xmath31 \" sample . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , these results rely only on the present lep  1.5 result , with the chargino - neutralino mass difference required to be more than 10 gev , and are in fact independent of the constraint on the higgs - boson mass ( item 4 above ) </S>",
    "<S> . we should add that our full sample contains a small fraction of points with very low values of the neutralino masses ( few gev ) , which manage to pass all lep  1 constraints ( see also @xcite ) and are not subjected to the known limits on the gluino mass as we do not impose the gut relation among gaugino masses . </S>",
    "<S> these points are , however , all excluded by either the @xmath56 constraint ( item 5 ) or the lep  1.5 constraint ( item 8) .    </S>",
    "<S> next we look for the largest achievable values of @xmath34 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : rbmax ] , we show @xmath71 as a function of the lightest chargino mass ( @xmath72 ) , for both signs of @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> the top curves (  none \" ) give the raw results obtained from the full sample of parameter six - plets , whereas the ( solid ) bottom curves (  all \" ) give the limiting values when _ all _ the above constraints are applied , in which case we find the absolute upper limit @xmath74 of particular importance in excluding values of @xmath75 is the higgs mass constraint ( item 4 above ) . as has already been mentioned , this constraint is worthy of further theoretical refinement , and may soon be strengthened by lep itself . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of not enforcing this constraint is represented by the dashed lines in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : rbmax ] . note that this constraint is superseded by the lep  1.5 constraint for @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> we also display as dotted lines the further restriction that may be obtained should the lep  1.5 be strengthened to exclude chargino - neutralino mass differences down to about 5 gev , assuming that the lower bound on the chargino mass remains at 65 gev . </S>",
    "<S> we note that if it were possible to obtain an absolute lower bound of 65 gev on the chargino mass , then only values of @xmath77 would be possible . </S>",
    "<S> future runs at lep  2 energies should be able to probe chargino masses as large as 90 gev , which would imply @xmath78 , should no chargino signal be observed .    </S>",
    "<S> the tevatron should also be able to constrain @xmath71 by setting lower limits on the chargino mass . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , d0 has just released its first limits on chargino - neutralino production and decay into trilepton final states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the limits are on the trilepton rates , , @xmath79 , which can be translated into limits on the chargino mass once one calculates the trilepton branching ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the latter depends on the detailed spectrum of sleptons and squarks ( which we do not consider ) , and may be enhanced if there are light sleptons @xcite , in which case the d0 limits imply @xmath80 @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . the possibility of light sleptons will soon be explored at lep , and the d0 sensitivity to trileptons is expected to increase significantly once the full data set is analyzed .    with a view to present and future top - squark searches at lep and the tevatron , </S>",
    "<S> we have also studied the dependence of @xmath71 on the lightest top - squark mass . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : rbmax - stop ] for the  none \" and  all \" cases ( with the higgs mass constraint included and allowing a chargino - neutralino mass difference of up to 10 gev ) . </S>",
    "<S> direct top - squark searches at the tevatron are underway , but so far have concentrated on top - squark decays via @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> this decay is dominant as long as @xmath82 . with this restriction , </S>",
    "<S> d0 has excluded a region in the @xmath64 plane @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this region is not very constraining for our present purposes , but it is expected that top - squark masses as large as 130 gev could be explored with the data ( @xmath83 ) already accumulated . as fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : rbmax - stop ] shows , a lower bound of this magnitude would impose new severe restrictions on the allowed values of @xmath34 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also explored the dependence of @xmath71 on @xmath56 and @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that more stringent experimental limits will decrease further the size of the allowed region in parameter space , but will not necessarily impose important new restrictions on @xmath71 .    </S>",
    "<S> requiring rather light top - squark masses may entail a degree of fine - tuning in the top - squark mass matrix , such as large values of @xmath84 . in the limit </S>",
    "<S> @xmath75 this situation may lead to minima of the electroweak scalar potential that break electric or color charge @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we do not include these constraints in the present analysis , as these would only further constrain the allowed region of parameter space .    before concluding , we note that imposing further theoretical constraints on the parameter space , such as those that follow from universal supersymmetry breaking masses at the gut scale and radiative electroweak breaking , tend to reduce @xmath71 very substantially @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consulting fig .  1 in ref </S>",
    "<S> .  @xcite , one can see that @xmath85 , after the new lep  1.5 limit is imposed .    even without imposing such additional theoretical constraints , the central result ( [ absolute ] ) of our analysis </S>",
    "<S> suggests that the previously most plausible supersymmetric scenario for accommodating the apparent anomaly in @xmath3 is now so severely constrained that it no longer appears able to resolve this experimental discrepancy with the standard model . in the absence of any other promising explanation from beyond the standard model , it may be necessary to review carefully the calculation and simulation of the standard model contributions to @xmath3 and related measurements . </S>",
    "<S> lep 1.5 has done much to clarify the prospects of a supersymmetric resolution of this lep 1 anomaly , and further stages of lep should be able to cement our conclusion . </S>"
