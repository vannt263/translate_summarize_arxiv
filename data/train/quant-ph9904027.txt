    "since stoler et al . introduced the binomial states ( bss)[1 ] , the so - called intermediate states have attracted considerable attention of physicists in the field of quantum optics .",
    "a feature of these states is that they interpolate between two fundamental quantum states , such as the number , coherent and squeezed states , and reduce to them in two different limits .",
    "for instance , the bss interpolate between the coherent states ( the most classical ) and the number states ( the most nonclassical)[1 - 6 ] , while the negative binomial states ( nbss ) interpolate between the coherent states and geometric states[7 - 11 ] .",
    "another feature of some intermediate states is that their photon number distributions are some famous discrete probability distributions in probability theory : the bs corresponds to the binomial distribution , the nbs to the negative binomial distribution , the hypergeometric state[12 ] to the hypergeometric distribution , and the negative hypergeometric state[13 ] to the negative hypergeometric distribution .",
    "recently barnett introduced a new definition of nbs[14 ] , @xmath0 ^{1/2}|n\\rangle , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the usual number state , @xmath2 and @xmath3 is a non - negative integer .",
    "they find that the nbs @xmath4 and the bs have similar properties if the roles of the creation operator @xmath5 and annihilation operator @xmath6 are interchanged .",
    "the photon number probability @xmath7 is associated with the probability that @xmath8 photons were present given that @xmath3 are found and that the probability for successfully detecting any single photon is @xmath9 .",
    "mixed states with the photon number probability include those applicable to photodetection and optical amplification[15 ] .",
    "the bs is a intermediate number - coherent state and the original nbs is a intermediate geometric - coherent state .",
    "one question naturally arises that if there exist an intermediate state which interpolates between the number and geometric state . in reality",
    ", the new nbs is just the intermediate number - geometric state .",
    "this fact will be seen in the next section .",
    "thus , we have three intermediate states which interpolate between two of the three fundamental states ( the number , coherent and geometric states ) .",
    "in the present paper we shall study the nonclassical properties and algebraic characteristics of the new nbs .",
    "the ladder operator formalism , displacement operator formalism and related algebraic structure will be formulated in section ii . it is interesting that the algebraic structure is the su(1,1 ) lie algebra via the generalized holstein - primarkoff realization . in section iii , we will show that the nbs can be viewed as excited geometric states , intermediate number - geometric states and nonlinear coherent states .",
    "the nonclassical properties , such as sub - poissonian distribution and squeezing effect will be investigated in detail in section iv .",
    "the q and wigner functions are studied in section v and the two methods of generation of the nbs are proposed in section vi .",
    "a conclusion is given in section vii .",
    "it is known that the bss are special su(2 ) coherent states[5,6 ] and the original nbss are perelomov s su(1,1 ) coherent states[11 ] via the standard holstein - primakoff realizations .",
    "so we expect that the algebra involved in the new nbs is su(1,1 ) lie algebra .",
    "it is easy to evaluate that @xmath10 ^{1/2}|\\eta , m+n\\rangle .\\ ] ] in particular , for @xmath11 , we get @xmath12 the creation operator raises the nbs @xmath4 to @xmath13 .",
    "this property is similar to the action of the creation operator on the fock state @xmath14 , @xmath15 actually , in the limit of @xmath16 , the nbs @xmath17 reduces to the number state @xmath14 and eq.(3 ) naturally reduces to eq.(4 ) .",
    "the key and interesting point is that there exists another operator @xmath18 which also raises the nbs @xmath4 to @xmath13 . from eq.(1 ) , the following equation is directly derived as @xmath19 comparing eq.(3 ) and eq.(5 ) , we get @xmath20 multiplying the both sides of the above equation by the operator @xmath21 from left , we obtain the ladder operator formalism of the nbs as @xmath22 in the limit of @xmath16 , we find that the nbs@xmath4 reduces to the number state @xmath14 and eq.(7 ) to the equation @xmath23 reminding of the standard holstein - primarkoff realization of su(1,1 ) lie algebra , @xmath24 , we call the new realization as generalized holstein - primakoff realization . to our knowledge , the new realization of su(1,1 ) lie algebra seems not to be addressed in the literature .    in terms of the generators @xmath25 and @xmath26 of the su(1,1 )",
    "lie algebra , eq.(7 ) is rewritten as @xmath27      now we try to find the displacement operator formalism of the nbs . to this end , let us rewrite the nbs as @xmath28 ^{1/2}|m+n\\rangle   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\eta ^{\\frac{m+1}2}\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{(\\sqrt{1-\\eta } a^{\\dagger } ) ^n% } { \\sqrt{n!}}|m\\rangle .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then by making use of the following identity @xmath29^n = a^{\\dagger n}f(\\hat{n}+n)f(\\hat{n}% + n-1) ... f(\\hat{n}+1),\\ ] ] eq.(10 ) can be written in the exponential form @xmath30 note that @xmath31 , then the displacement operator formalism is obtained as @xmath32 where @xmath33=arctanh @xmath34 . in the derivation of the above equation",
    ", we have used the identity @xmath35 . as seen from eq.(13 ) , the nbs can be simply recognized as su(1,1 ) displaced number states . actually , the nbs are essentially peremolov s coherent states as shown below .    on the space @xmath36",
    "we have @xmath37 this is the discrete representation of su(1,1 ) lie algebra with bargaman index @xmath38 .",
    "we see that the generalized holstein - primakoff realization gives rise to the representation of su(1,1 ) on the space @xmath39 .",
    "note that @xmath40 , the nbs can be written as @xmath41 this shows the nbs are essentially peremolov s coherent states .",
    "from eq.(10 ) we obtain @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the geometric state[16 - 21 ] , which is also called susskind - glogower phase state[11 ] , phase eigenstate[16,17],and coherent phase state[19 ] .",
    "the photon number distribution is @xmath44 , the geometric distribution . from eq.(18 )",
    "the nbss can be generated by repeated application of the creation operator @xmath5 on the geometric states .",
    "this shows that the nbs belongs to an interesting class of nonclassical states , excited quantum states .",
    "these states are first introduced by agarwal and tara as excited coherent states[22 ] .",
    "so the nbss can be viewed as excited geometric states .",
    "setting @xmath45 in eq.(18 ) , we get @xmath46 which shows that the nbs reduces to the geometric states for @xmath45 . note that the nbs reduces to the number state @xmath47 in the limit of @xmath48 .",
    "thus , the nbs interpolates between the number state and geometric state and can be viewed as number - geometric state .",
    "the geometric states are the eigenstates of the susskind - glogower phase operator[23 ] @xmath49 , obeying the equation @xmath50 comparing with the definition of the nonlinear coherent states@xmath51[24,25 ] @xmath52 we know that the geometric states are nonlinear coherent states with the nonlinear function @xmath53 .",
    "in a previous work , we have proved a general result that the excited nonlinear coherent states are still nonlinear coherent states[26 ] .",
    "since the geometric states are nonlinear coherent states and the nbss can be recognized as excited geometric states , we infer that the nbss are nonlinear coherent states .",
    "in fact , multiplying eq.(7 ) by the annihilation operator @xmath6 from the left , we get @xmath54 since we discuss the problem in the space @xmath39(eq.(15 ) ) , we can multiply eq.(23 ) by @xmath55 $ ] from left .",
    "this leads to @xmath56a|\\eta , m\\rangle = \\sqrt{1-\\eta } |\\eta , m\\rangle .\\ ] ] the above equation shows that the nbs are nonlinear coherent states with the nonlinear function @xmath57 .",
    "eq.(24 ) naturally reduces to eq.(21 ) for @xmath45 .",
    "the simplest way to investigate the statistical characteristics of the radiation field is to differentiate the generation function @xmath58 with respect to the auxiliary real number @xmath59 . here",
    "@xmath60 is the photon distribution function of the nbs .",
    "the factorial moments are defined as @xmath61 and @xmath62 as @xmath63 then we can easily derive mandel s q parameter @xmath64 which measures the deviation from the poisson distribution which corresponds to the coherent state with @xmath65 .",
    "if @xmath66 , the field is called sub(super)-poissonian .",
    "the denominator of eq.(28 ) is positive since @xmath67 , while the numerator can be positive or negative . for @xmath45 , @xmath68 .",
    "the nbs @xmath69(geometric state ) is super - poissonian except @xmath70 . for @xmath71 ,",
    "the condition for the numerator @xmath72 is @xmath73 it can be proved that @xmath74 .",
    "thus the nbs @xmath75 is super - poissonian when @xmath76 and sub - poissonian when @xmath77 . as @xmath3 increases , @xmath78 decreases and the sub - poissonian range increases .",
    "define the quadrature operators @xmath79(coordinate ) and @xmath80 ( momentum ) by @xmath81 then their variances @xmath82 obey the heisenberg s uncertainty relation @xmath83 if one of the @xmath84 and @xmath85 is less than 1/4 , the squeezing occurs . in the present case ,",
    "@xmath86 and @xmath87 are real .",
    "thus , the variances of @xmath79 and @xmath80 can be written as @xmath88 from eq.(2 ) , the expectation values @xmath86 and @xmath89 are obtained as @xmath90^{1/2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using eqs.(26 ) , and ( 33)-(36 ) , we can investigate the squeezing effect .    by numerical calculations , we find that the squeezing occurs in both the quadrature @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "fig.1 gives the variance of the quadrature @xmath79 versus @xmath9 for different @xmath3 .",
    "it can be seen that the range and degree of squeezing increase as @xmath3 increases .",
    "there exists a critical value of @xmath3 .",
    "when @xmath91 , there is no squeezing for arbitrary values of @xmath9 .",
    "the squeezing also occurs in the quadrature @xmath80 as shown in fig.2 . in contrary to the squeezing in the quadrature @xmath79 , the range and degree decrease as @xmath3 increases .",
    "when @xmath3 is larger than a critical value 31 , no squeezing occurs .",
    "if a field is prepared in a quantum state described by a density operator @xmath92 , we can define the @xmath93-parametrized quasiprobability distribution in phase space as[27 ] @xmath94 where the quantum characteristic function is @xmath95\\exp ( s|\\xi |^2/2).\\ ] ] here @xmath96 , with @xmath97 being the @xmath98 numbers corresponding to the quadratures @xmath99 , and @xmath100 is glauber s displacement operator .",
    "it is possible to write the @xmath93-parametrized quasiprobability distribution as a infinite series [ 28 ] @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the so - called displaced number state .",
    "the expression above is suitable for direct numerical calculations .",
    "if we take @xmath103 , eq.(39 ) is reduced to the familiar expression for the @xmath104 function @xmath105 note that since the nbs can be viewed as an excited geometric state [ see eq.(18 ) ] , we obtain the q function of the nbs as @xmath106 in fig.3 we present plots of the @xmath104 function of a nbs for different values of @xmath9 and @xmath107 .",
    "we can clearly see the deformation of the @xmath104 function . when @xmath70 , the @xmath104 function representing the number state latexmath:[$%    function we can also study the squeezing effects by examining the deformation of their contours .",
    "fig.4 is the contour plot of the @xmath104 functions of two particular nbss , with ( a ) @xmath109 and ( b ) @xmath110 .",
    "we can clearly see the compression along the @xmath111 and @xmath112 direction , which corresponds to squeezing in the @xmath80 quadrature of the first nbs and in the @xmath79 quadrature of the second .      by taking @xmath113 in eq.(39 ) , we obtain a series representation for the wigner function @xmath114 now we insert eq.(1 ) into the above equation , which yields @xmath115 in the expression above , the matrix elements @xmath116 are given by[29 ] @xmath117 are the generalized hypergeometric functions[30 ] .",
    "the present form of @xmath118 is convenient for numerical calculations .",
    "the wigner function can be used to trace the nonclassical behaviors of quantum states .",
    "it is known that the negativity of the wigner function is a sufficient but not necessary condition for having nonclassical effects . in fig.5",
    "we give plots of the wigner function of a nbs by numerical calculations of eq.(43 ) for different values of @xmath119 and @xmath120 . as in fig.5(a ) , the negative part of the wigner function is already noticeable for @xmath121 . for @xmath122[fig.5(b ) ] , the negative part is pronounced . in fig5(c ) , for @xmath123 , the negative part is even larger , and finally , in fig.7(d ) , we have the full wigner function of a number state @xmath124(@xmath125 ) .",
    "the wigner function becomes more and more negative as @xmath119 increases .",
    "let us discuss the dynamical generation of the nbs .",
    "we consider two different methods .",
    "the first is quite straightforward in concept from the displacement operator formalism(eq.(13 ) ) but might not be very easy to achieve experimentally .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath126   \\nonumber \\\\ h_0 & = & \\omega a^{\\dagger } a.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the constant @xmath127 is the coupling strength .",
    "the coupling is of intensity - dependent type and is similar to those in some intensity - dependent jaynes - cummings models [ 31 - 34 ] .",

    "here @xmath140    once the two - mode geometric state is prepared , one can generate two - mode nbs by the following procedure in analogy to that proposed by agawal and tara[22 ] .",
    "consider the passage of a two - level excited atom through a cavity .",
    "let the initial state of the atom - field system be @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the atomic excited state .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian has the form[37 ]    @xmath143    where @xmath144 are the psedospin operators of the atom and @xmath145 is the coupling constant .",

    "for the multiphoton processes , the hamiltonian ( eq.(51 ) ) is replaced by a new hamiltonian with @xmath151 thus , the above procedure for a multiphoton process will result in the state    @xmath152",
