    "the duality relations ( [ eq : drgf ] ) and ( [ eq : drpos ] ) are approximate results , as denoted by the relation symbol . as derived in this work , they are valid when the following conditions are simultaneously met :    a.   long - time dynamics : the measurement time  @xmath48 should be much longer than the time scale  @xmath128 set by dissipation .",

    "this condition is controlled by the dissipation and the temperature .",

    ", the function  @xmath140 takes the simple form @xmath141 , and the divergence of  @xmath142 allows to restrict the configuration sum to its primed version .",
    "a physically more realistic situation would be to consider the ohmic spectral density  @xmath143 with finite cutoff frequency  @xmath144 .",

    "@xcite in the frame of linear response for a sinusoidal potential .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the derivation presented in that work does not require the restrictions to the rare transitions limit and to a strictly ohmic bath .",
    "a more generalized version of  ( [ eq : drmobility ] ) has also been obtained for a much broader class of spectral densities , including sub - ohmic and super - ohmic ones , and in the case of time - dependent driving .",
    "we currently do not see any problem of principle in order to generalize our demonstration for a general form of the spectral density , and this is the subject of work in progress .",
    "however , we do not see how to avoid the restriction to the rare transitions limit in our derivation .",
    "furthermore , we do not know how to generalize the identities  ( [ eq : idpnormdifff ] ) , which we have used in our proof , for the case of time - dependent driving .",
    "these remain open questions .",
    "let us now give some interpretation of the results .",

    "is specified by : i ) the relation  ( [ eq : defdelta ] ) between the harmonics of the potential of the original system and the couplings in the tight - binding system ; ii ) the relation  @xmath90 between the spatial periodicities  @xmath5 of the original system , and  @xmath108 of the tight - binding system ; iii ) the relation  ( [ eq : defsdtb ] ) between the spectral densities of the baths of harmonics oscillators coupled to each of the two systems . in the original system ,",
    "the relevant dynamical parameters are captured by the dissipation parameter  @xmath145 and the energy drop per periodicity length  @xmath146 . due to the change of periodicity length ,",
    "these parameters become  @xmath147 and  @xmath148 in the tight - binding system .",
    "thus , weak dissipation in one system maps to strong dissipation in the other one , although the viscosity  @xmath18 in the spectral density does not change .",
    "the duality relation for the average position  ( [ eq : drpos ] ) is an example of a useful result which can be extracted from  ( [ eq : drgf ] ) .",
    "there , the relation between the average positions @xmath34 and @xmath149 in the two systems , which holds at long time , is explicit .",
    "the asymptotic dynamics covered by this result is usually described in terms of the nonlinear mobility @xmath150 .",
    "accordingly , the duality relation  ( [ eq : drpos ] ) may be rewritten in the form @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the mobility of the free system , @xmath153 . in the special case of a sinusoidal potential ,",
    "this relation was already obtained in  @xcite for the dc mobility .",
    "as mentioned above , it has also been derived in  @xcite for the linear ac mobility in a sinusoidal potential .",
    "the second derivative of the generating function  @xmath154 with respect to its parameter  @xmath155 yields the variance  @xmath156 , which gives information about diffusion and current noise .",
    "it would thus be natural to try to extract from  ( [ eq : drgf ] ) a duality relation for this quantity .",
    "however , the result diverges , because the quantity  @xmath157 involved in the right - hand side diverges for the strictly ohmic spectral density  @xmath139 considered in the derivation . in order to get results on diffusion and current noise",
    ", we shall thus have to go beyond this approximation and allow for an ohmic bath with finite cutoff frequency . as mentioned above",

    "<S> brownian motion in ratchet potentials  @xcite has attracted a lot of interest . </S>",
    "<S> one reason is the fact that ratchet systems , i.e.  periodic structures with broken spatial symmetry , present the property of allowing transport under the influence of unbiased forces . </S>",
    "<S> the interest has recently grown with the transfer of the problem in the quantum regime . </S>",
    "<S> there , the description of dissipative tunneling  @xcite presents a theoretical challenge which was tackled in relatively few works  @xcite , while first experimental realizations were reported  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> after the semiclassical work  @xcite , further progress towards the theoretical description of quantum ratchets involved modeling in terms of tight - binding systems  @xcite or in terms of a molecular wire  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other available methods include perturbation theory  @xcite or a quantum smoluchowski equation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most of these methods  @xcite are restricted to the regime of moderate - to - strong friction .    </S>",
    "<S> the approach discussed in this article originates from works  @xcite on quantum brownian motion in a tilted sinusoidal potential , which led to a duality relation for the mobility of the system considered with the one of a driven dissipative tight - binding model . </S>",
    "<S> this idea emerged first in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where the linear dc mobility at zero temperature was considered . in that work the interest was focused on the occurrence of a diffusion - to - localization transition in the system with increasing dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> these results were corroborated by means of renormalization - group methods  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the duality relation was extended to the nonlinear dc mobility at finite temperatures in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where an extensive physical discussion as well as important milestones of the proof were given . </S>",
    "<S> it was subsequently applied to the investigation of the current - voltage characteristic of small josephson junctions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> later , an identical duality relation for the linear ac mobility was obtained by a different approach in the frame of linear response  @xcite . in particular , that work went beyond the case of a strictly ohmic dissipative bath considered in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and included the case of an ohmic bath with finite cutoff frequency as well as sub and super - ohmic baths . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the formalism of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite was generalized to arbitrary ratchet potentials , i.e. , periodic potentials of arbitrary shape . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the duality relation was extended to the average position of the quantum particle at long time . in the present article </S>",
    "<S> , we give detailed proofs and discussion of these last results . </S>",
    "<S> the duality relation is obtained in its most general form , in terms of the generating function out of which the average position , the mobility , and other dynamical quantities can be extracted . </S>",
    "<S> its domain of validity includes weak dissipation and nonlinear driving . </S>",
