    "the addition of d+au collisions to the experimental programme at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) has allowed an important control system to be studied and compared to au+au collisions .",
    "recent au+au observations made at rhic include high-@xmath0  suppression @xcite and the related disappearance of back - to - back correlations @xcite .",
    "performing the same analyses with d+au can distinguish new phenomena related to effects of the final state rather than to the initial state of the au nucleus , as a strongly interacting final state should not form in d+au collisions .",
    "it was quickly established that high-@xmath0  suppression is not present in d+au collisions , nor are back - to - back correlations suppressed @xcite .",
    "another key observation is the difference in nuclear modification factors for various hadronic species in the intermediate @xmath0  region ( 2 - 5 gev / c ) @xcite .",
    "these measurements sparked renewed interest in previous p+n collision experiments at lower energies , where a @xmath0-dependent effect on hadron production , with an enhancement in the @xmath0  region above 1 gev / c , was discovered @xcite .",
    "this enhancement , termed the `` cronin effect '' , shows differences between protons , pions and kaons .",
    "the measurements for pions , which are the most precise , showed the magnitude of the effect decreasing with increasing centre - of - mass energy , @xmath1 gev @xcite . by investigating identified hadron production at @xmath2 gev",
    "we can see whether the difference in nuclear modification factors with hadron species in au+au collisions could be related to a difference in the cronin effect .",
    "looking at forward rapidities , where the saturation scale is larger , we may be sensitive to effects predicted by saturation models  @xcite .",
    "in this analysis the following solenoidal tracker at rhic ( star ) tracking detectors were used  @xcite ; a large cylindrical time projection chamber ( tpc ) at mid - rapidity  @xcite , further tpcs in the forward regions ( ftpc ) , around rapidity , @xmath3  @xcite . zero - degree calorimeters ( zdc ) which detect spectator neutrons near to beam rapidity are available for triggering  @xcite . a minimum bias trigger consisting of a coincident zdc signal from spectator neutrons on the au side and a timing signal indicating the window for the bunch crossing",
    "was employed to collect around 20 million events . in the offline analysis",
    "these were reduced to 10 million events by insisting that the collision occurred within @xmath4 cm of the centre of the tpc ensuring that reliable efficiency and acceptance calculations could be made .",
    "particle identification relied on a time - of - flight ( tof ) detector which covers the rapidity interval @xmath5  @xcite , where the negative rapidity represents the au - side .",
    "additionally , weakly decaying neutral strange particles were identified using the tpc by their charged daughter decay modes ( @xmath6 )  @xcite and kaons by their kink decay inside the tpc gas volume ( @xmath7 )  @xcite .",
    "neutral strange particle @xmath0  spectra were obtained at mid - rapidity ( @xmath8 ) up to 5 gev / c and up to 2 gev / c for charged kaons .",
    "spectra from the tof up to @xmath0  of 1.6 and 3 gev / c for pions and protons respectively were measured  @xcite . although the ftpcs have some acceptance for pseudorapidity @xmath9 throughout the range 2.5 to 4.0 , the measurement was restricted to the interval @xmath10 , where the acceptance is good for a large range in @xmath0 , which avoids problems when extrapolating the spectra .",
    "the @xmath11  calculation also requires spectra from p+p collisions and those for @xmath12  and @xmath13  are presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the nuclear modification factor , @xmath14 used to look at the nuclear effects on hadron production in d+au , is calculated as the ratio to the production in p+p with a scaling by the number of binary collisions @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the mean number of binary collisions , calculated in a glauber model , and has a value of 7.5 for minimum bias d+au collisions  @xcite .",
    "shows the result for @xmath13  and averaged @xmath17 and @xmath18 , along with previously reported results for protons , pions  @xcite and unidentified negative hadrons  @xcite . the uncertainty in the scaling is represented by the grey box at one .",
    "unfortunately the corrections needed to produce the @xmath12 result were not complete at the time of the presentation .",
    "however , it is possible to access information about the nuclear modification factor by forming a ratio of central to peripheral d+au collisions , @xmath19 similar to @xmath14 .",
    "centrality classes for the analysis of mid - rapidity spectra are defined by cutting on the multiplicity observed in the ftpc on the au side .",
    "the measured distribution was shown to match well with the expectation from a glauber model @xcite .",
    "centrality classes corresponding to the most central @xmath20 and least central @xmath21 were defined with @xmath22 of 15.0 and 4.0 respectively .",
    "this ratio for @xmath12 and @xmath13  is shown in .",
    "efforts to use the ftpc for identifying strange particles are still at an early stage @xcite but @xmath19  can be formed in a limited @xmath0  range for charged hadron spectra for both the d and au sides as shown in . in this case",
    "the centrality definition uses the multiplicity at mid - rapidity as the estimator .",
    "the identified @xmath14  results show that a significant cronin enhancement is still present at this centre - of - mass energy and for @xmath13  at higher @xmath0  is consistent with the value found in @xmath23 gev p+w collisions  @xcite .",
    "the values for protons are systematically above those for @xmath13   at low @xmath0  but then become indistinguishable at higher @xmath0  in part due to the increasing statistical uncertainties .",
    "@xmath19  values for @xmath12 and @xmath13  seem to show that the nuclear modification for @xmath12 is consistently higher over the full measured range in @xmath0  in agreement with other results @xcite .",
    "it is not really possible to generalise and say whether this effect is mass - related or a meson - baryon ordering effect without measuring further hadron species to higher @xmath0 .",
    "the size of the effect is rather small in relation to the large differences seen in the nuclear modification factors when comparing central and peripheral au+au collisions .",
    "this indicates that the au+au system is exhibiting an effect due to the final state formed in the collision .",
    "a more dramatic centrality dependent effect in d+au is seen at forward rapidities . here",
    ", there is a _ suppression _ with increasing centrality on the d - side but almost no difference on the au - side .",
