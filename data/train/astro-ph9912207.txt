    "soft gamma  ray repeaters ( sgrs ) are neutron stars whose multiple bursts of gamma  rays distinguish them from other gamma  ray burst sources ( e.g @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "sgrs are also unusual x  ray pulsars in that they have spin periods clustered in the interval @xmath2 s , and they all appear to be associated ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) with supernova remnants ( snrs ) , which limits their average age to approximately @xmath3 kyr ( @xcite ) .",
    "the angular offsets of the sgrs from the apparent centers of their associated supernova remnant shells indicate that sgrs are endowed with space velocities @xmath4 km s@xmath5 , which are greater than the space velocities of most radio pulsars ( @xcite ) . anomalous x  ray pulsars ( axps ) are similar to sgrs in that they are radio quiet x  ray pulsars with spin periods clustered in the range @xmath6 s , and have similar persistent x  ray luminosities as the sgrs ( @xmath7 ergs s@xmath5 , see e.g. @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "most of the axps appear to be associated with supernova remnants , and therefore they are also thought to be young neutron stars like the sgrs .",
    "the spin periods of both axps and sgrs are increasing with time ( spinning - down ) , and show no evidence for intervals of decreasing spin period ( spin - up ) , although the spin - down rates of many of the sgrs and axps appear to be variable or `` bumpy '' ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; although for a different viewpoint see @xcite ) .    the lack of identified companions at non x  ray wavelengths ( e.g. @xcite ) and doppler shifts associated with binary orbital motion ( @xcite ) , together with the problem of accelerating binaries to space velocities @xmath8 km s@xmath5 ( @xcite ) , imply that sgrs and axps are not members of high mass binary systems , although low mass systems with neutron star companions of @xmath9 are not constrained in most cases . if sgrs and axps spin - down primarily via the emission of magnetic dipole radiation ( mdr ) , as do radio pulsars , then they must have surface dipole fields of @xmath10 g or greater ( i.e. `` magnetars '' ; e.g. @xcite )",
    ". observations of the sgrs 180620 ( @xcite ) and 1900 + 14 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , however , indicate that the present - day spin - down rates of these sgrs are inconsistent with simple mdr , given the ages of their associated supernova remnants ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and imply that the spin - downs are due to winds .",
    "magnetar - strength fields might still be possible in these sources , however , if alfvn wave wind emission is infrequent and intermittent ( @xcite , so that the presently observed spin - down rates are atypical .",
    "alternative scenarios for sgrs and axps involving typical pulsar magnetic fields ( @xmath11 g ) have been proposed ( @xcite ; alpar 2000 ; chatterjee , hernquist & narayan 2000 ; chatterjee & hernquist 2000 ) . in these models ,",
    "the sgrs and axps have spun - down rapidly via magnetospheric accretion torques from outflowing `` propeller effect '' winds .",
    "the assumed sources of the magnetospheric material are either fallback accretion disks ( alpar 2000 ; chatterjee , hernquist & narayan 2000 ; chatterjee & hernquist 2000 ) , or fossil disks formed from expanding supernova ejecta intercepted by high velocity neutron stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    here",
    "we present a fresh look at evidence which suggests that sgrs and axps are born into unusually dense environments .",
    "we show that the environments of the sgr and axp progenitors into which their snrs expand are the dense , warm and cool phases of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and not the hot tenuous phase of the ism where most of the neutron - star - producing , core collapse supernovae of massive o and b stars occur and where most young radio pulsars are found .",
    "this implies that there is an environmental factor influencing the development of sgrs and axps .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "we first discuss the typical environments of supernova progenitors in @xmath12 , and then supernova remnants associated with sgrs and axps in @xmath13 , followed by a discussion of the sgr and axp ages and distances are in @xmath14 . in @xmath15",
    "the density of the sgr and axp progenitor environments is discussed , and in @xmath16 a similar analysis is done for the snrs associated with young radio pulsars . in @xmath17",
    "we discuss the statistical significance of the results and the implications for magnetar and propeller - based models for sgrs and axps .",
    "finally , the appendix contains a short discussion of the ages , distances , and other information for each sgr and axp .",
    "what are the environments typical of neutron star progenitors ? observations clearly show that the majority of neutron stars are formed in `` superbubbles '' : evacuated regions of the ism which surround the ob associations in which the massive progenitors of most neutron stars live .",
    "this is because most o and b stars ( @xmath18 80% ) are observed ( e.g. mccray & snow 1979 ) to occur in clusters formed from giant molecular clouds ( @xmath19 ) ; much smaller clouds are disrupted by the radiation and winds from the first o star that forms .",
    "these massive ( @xmath20 m@xmath21 : @xcite ) and slow - moving ( @xmath22 km s@xmath5 : @xcite ) o and b star progenitors of type ii and ib / c supernovae do not travel far from their birthplaces during their relatively short ( @xmath1 myr : @xcite ) lives .",
    "the supernovae from these massive stars are therefore heavily clustered in space and time and form vast ( @xmath23 pc ) hii regions / superbubbles ( e , g .",
    "@xcite ) filled with a hot ( @xmath24 k ) and tenuous ( @xmath25 @xmath26 ) gas .    there is also direct observational evidence that the great majority ( @xmath1880% ) of neutron star stars are born into superbubbles consisting of hot and diffuse ism gas .",
    "observations of a sample of 49 spectroscopically identified type ii and ib / c , core - collapse supernovae occurring in face - on late - type spiral galaxies by van dyk et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found that @xmath27 of type ii and @xmath28 of type ib / c supernovae are in resolvable giant hii region superbubbles .",
    "we suggest that these fractions are , in fact , only a lower limit on the occurrence of core - collapse supernovae in superbubbles , because of the difficulty in detecting faint hii regions in distant galaxies . correcting for this effect using the h@xmath29 luminosity distributions of kennicutt , edgar , & hodge ( 1989 ) , we find that the h@xmath29 threshold used by van dyk et al .",
    "( 1996 ) would have allowed them to resolve only @xmath30 of the hii regions in their sample galaxies .",
    "this clearly suggests that the great majority  i.e. @xmath31  of neutron star progenitors reside in the hot and diffuse ( @xmath32 @xmath26 ) ism in superbubbles , with @xmath33 occurring in the denser phases of the ism .",
    "when one corrects for selection effects , the distribution of surface brightness of all detected galactic supernova remnants provides another measure of the fractions of supernovae occurring in the warm and hot phases of the ism .",
    "detections of radio remnants are limited by surface brightness , which is independent of their distance , and snrs in the denser ism have larger surface brightnesses than snrs of the same age in the hot / diffuse ism ( e.g. @xcite ) . a study ( @xcite ) of the age versus surface brightness of the remnants of historical supernovae , using gull s model",
    ", suggests that the maximum detectable ages of radio supernova remnants above a nominal surface brightness density of 10@xmath34 w m@xmath35 hz@xmath5 sr@xmath5 at 408 mhz are roughly 20 kyr in the warm ( @xmath36 @xmath26 ) gas and 6 kyr in the hot superbubble ( @xmath37 @xmath26 ) gas . combining this with an analysis of the number distribution of snrs as a function of surface brightness suggests that about @xmath38 of the detected radio snrs are in the warm denser ( @xmath39 @xmath26 ) phase of the ism ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that only about @xmath40 of the supernovae occur in the warm ( @xmath39 @xmath26 ) ism , and about @xmath41 in the hot phase , since , for a total ( including type ia ) sn rate of 1 sn every 30 yrs , there are then roughly 180 snr younger than 6 kyr that are detectable in the hot superbubble ism , and roughly 70 snr younger than 20 kyr that are detectable in the denser warm ism , or about @xmath38 of the detected radio snrs in the warm ism  as the observed distribution implies .",
    "the environments of sgrs and axps are probed by the blastwaves of their associated supernova remnants , and from the size of the remnant shell as a function of the age we can constrain the external density . in table",
    "@xmath42 we have listed the @xmath43 known sgrs and axps and their associated supernova remnant shells . for more information on the individual sgrs and axps , see the recent reviews of hurley ( 2000a ) and mereghetti ( 1999 ) , and the appendix .",
    "we include the source axp 18450258  although no period derivative has been measured for this source  because it is commonly cited as an axp ( see e.g. the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "we also include the axp 07203125 for completeness , although its identification as an axp has been questioned as well ( see appendix ) .",
    "the new and tentative sgr 180123 has also been included on the basis of two soft gamma  ray bursts consistent with a single location on the sky ( @xcite ) .",
    "the identification of the associated remnants are based on positional coincidences between the remnant and the sgr / axp , and in some cases on similar distances as implied by the hydrogen column densities measured from the x  ray spectrum of the sgr / axp and its associated remnant .",
    "based on these criteria , associated snrs have been previously been identified for 7 out of the 12 sgrs and axps ( see table 1 and appendix ) . using these same criteria",
    ", we suggest three additional snr associations with sgr / axps ( also included in table 1 and appendix ) .",
    "we suggest two new axp / snr associations , axp 170940 with the snr g346.60.2 ( @xcite and references therein ) and axp 10485937 with g287.80.5 ( @xcite ) , based on the near coincident positions between each axp and a known supernova remnant , and also ( for axp 10485937/g287.80.5 ) on similar implied distances for the axp and the remnant . these two associations may have been discounted previously because they would imply larger than average neutron star velocities , but in view of the comparable velocities implied for three of the sgrs these possible associations should be considered .",
    "axp 10485937 lies @xmath44 shell radii from the apparent center of the snr g287.80.5 , which is associated with the carina nebula , a region of massive star formation at a distance @xmath45 pc ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this relatively small distance of the snr is quite consistent ( see fig .",
    "2 ) with the low @xmath46 cm@xmath35 found from the axp 10485937 x  ray spectral fits ( @xcite ) . for an estimated snr age of @xmath4820 kyr",
    ", the displacement of the axp implies a relatively modest neutron star velocity of @xmath49 km s@xmath5 .",
    "a similar transverse velocity is indicated by the association of axp 170940 , which lies 1.7 shell radii from the center of the well defined shell remnant g346.60.2 , assuming a similar age and a distance of 3 to 5 kpc , based on galactic structure .",
    "such a snr distance is quite consistent with its association with axp 170940 , which has an x - ray absorption @xmath50 cm@xmath35 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also propose that the new sgr candidate 180123 ( @xcite ) may be associated with the well studied snr w28 .",
    "although there is no distance estimate to the sgr ( @xcite ) , w28 is the only known snr through which the thin sgr error box passes .",
    "therefore we regard the tentative w28/sgr 180123 association as promising and encourage observations to search for x  ray point sources ( e.g. @xcite ) within the remnant which may be the sgr counterpart .",
    "we include these three tentative snr associations because they are suggestive , but as we show in @xmath51 these data can be left out of the sample without affecting the overall conclusions of our analysis .    using the snr catalog of green ( 2000 ) , we are unable to identify any possible remnants associated with axps 07203125 and 0142@xmath52615 , which may be the two oldest axps based on their pulsar timing ages @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the pulsar period and @xmath55 is the period derivative , of @xmath56 kyr ( @xcite ) and @xmath57 kyr ( e.g. @xcite ) , respectively . for axp 07203125",
    "the lack of an associated remnant is not surprising , because this source is thought to be so close ( @xmath58 pc ) that a neutron star with a velocity of @xmath48 1000 km s@xmath5 would have traveled @xmath59 pc in @xmath56 kyr and hence could have originated from a large area of the sky .",
    "in addition , the large scale radio surveys of the galactic plane appear to be incomplete for very large ( @xmath60 ) diameter remnants ( e.g. @xcite ) , indicating that such a remnant could easily go undetected .",
    "axp 0142@xmath52615 is situated in or behind a molecular cloud complex ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and if its associated remnant expanded in high density material it may have already passed into the radiative phase and faded below the surface brightness detection threshold . therefore the detection of the remnants associated with both axp 07203125 and axp 0142@xmath52615 would be difficult , and we can not assign meaningful limits to the physical size of their ( unknown ) associated remnants , given the present data .",
    "we encourage new deep observations of the regions surrounding these objects to look for associated supernova remnants .",
    "we see from table 1 that 10 out of the 12 sgr / axps have proposed associations with radio shell snrs .",
    "the probabilities of a chance coincidence for some of the individual associations have been estimated ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) at a few times 10@xmath35 or less ( see appendix ) .",
    "the chance probability for an association between an sgr / axp and an snr can be estimated by simply considering the spatial density of known supernova remnants in the galactic plane ( in the following we assume that the localization error box of the sgr / axp is small compared to the size of the snr ) . for the extreme case , we consider just the sgrs and axps located in the highly crowded inner galaxy . there",
    "all @xmath61 sgr / axps appear to have associated snrs .",
    "these have galactic longitudes between 286@xmath62 and 43@xmath62 and latitudes within @xmath63 1.2@xmath62 . within this area of 1.0@xmath6410@xmath65 arc min@xmath66 , there are 142 known snrs ( green 2000 ) covering a combined surface area of 3.4@xmath6410@xmath67 arc min@xmath66 , which is actually an overestimation due to overlap between the remnants . for a single association with the sgr or axp displaced from the center of the remnant by as much as @xmath68 times the remnant radius ( as implied by the sgr 162741/g337.00.1 association ) ,",
    "the chance association probability is roughly @xmath69 , or @xmath70 correcting for overlap .",
    "thus there is a significant probability that a single association might be simply a chance coincidence , if we relied solely on position , but the probability of getting even 4 chance associations out of 8 tries is only 2% , and the probability that 8 out of 8 are spurious is just @xmath71 .",
    "in order to probe the snr environments , we need to know both the radii of the associated snr shells , which can be determined from their measured angular diameters , and their estimated distances . these distances are listed in table 2 , and discussed in the appendix .",
    "all but three of the distances were determined from galactic kinematic arguments based on interactions or associations with adjacent objects with known distances ( e.g. hii regions or molecular clouds ) , or on absorption line measurements .",
    "we did not use distances estimated from the standard snr surface brightness / diameter relationships , because we did not want to bias the snr sizes toward snrs in the dense ism , which is where most of the observed radio snrs are located ( e.g. higdon & lingenfelter 1980 ; kafatos et al . 1980 ) .",
    "snrs expanding in the tenuous hot ism become large and hard to detect ( e.g. @xcite ) much quicker than snrs in dense environments and are under - represented .",
    "the positions of the galactic snrs associated with sgrs and axps are shown in figure @xmath42 , projected onto a model of the galactic plane distribution of free electrons ( @xcite ) which traces star formation regions delineating the spiral arms ( e.g. georgelin & georgelin 1976 ) .",
    "we see that the estimated distances of the snrs are quite consistent galactic structure , placing them in or near the spiral arms where the bulk of recent massive star formation has occurred .",
    "we also see that the estimated distances of the snrs are not systematically underestimated in our analysis , since 5 out of the 9 snr - axp / sgr associations lie roughly at or beyond the distance of the galactic center  as would be expected for a relatively unbiased sample of galactic sources .",
    "this also shows that they are not likely to be systematically much farther away , or most would lie on the other side of the galaxy or even outside of the galaxy .    to further test both the axp / sgr  snr associations and their estimated distances , we compare the electron column depth associated with the snr distance with the h column depth determined from the x - ray absorption of the axp / sgr emission .",
    "we calculate the dispersion measure to each source given the assumed distances and compare that to the measured @xmath72 value for each source .",
    "table @xmath73 lists the distance ranges , calculated dispersion measures using the taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) model , and observed @xmath72 values for each sgr / axp and associated snr . the dispersion measure ( dm ) vs. @xmath72",
    "is plotted in figure @xmath73 .",
    "as seen from the figure , the data points are well correlated between lines representing free electron to hydrogen ratios @xmath74 , which is consistent with the range of @xmath75 , expected from the mean mass fraction of ionized gas in the galaxy of @xmath76 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus we see that each of associations is consistent both in proximity of direction and in similarity of distance .",
    "this also shows that the estimated distances to the sgrs / axps and their associated remnants are not systematically underestimated .",
    "more information on the @xmath72 values for each source is given in the appendix .",
    "the ages of the most of the sgrs and axps are much more uncertain than their distances .",
    "this is because the usual pulsar timing age formula ",
    "appropriate for pulsar spin - down due to magnetic dipole radiation ( mdr ) torque ( although @xcite )  does not seem to be applicable for sgrs and axps , in general , because it yields age estimates which are inconsistent with the likely ages of the associated supernova remnants and the implied neutron star velocities for at least three of the sources ( sgr 180620 , sgr 1900 + 14 , and axp 2259 + 58.6 : @xcite ; @xcite ; and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "in addition , all of the sgr and axps for which pulsar braking indices have been measured ",
    "axps 170940 and 2259 + 58.6 ( @xcite ) and sgr 180620 ( @xcite )  have braking indices which are inconsistent with simple mdr spin - down . the mdr timing age for axp 1841045 of 4000 yr",
    ", however , is consistent with the estimated age of the associated snr kes 73 ( @xcite ) , but the braking index for this axp has not yet been measured .",
    "we therefore adopt ages for the sgrs and axps based on the ages of their associated snrs .",
    "some of the associated remnants ( n49 , kes 73 , g29.6@xmath520.1 , and ctb 109 ) are relatively well - studied and have age estimates based on observed shock velocities and/or x  ray temperatures . for these remnants",
    "we take the minimum and maximum values for the ages of each remnant from the literature . for the rest of associated snrs",
    ", we adopt a lower age limit of @xmath77 $ ] , where @xmath78 is the age of the remnant assuming free expansion , with @xmath79 the minimum estimated distance , @xmath80",
    "the snr radius in radians , and @xmath81 km s@xmath5 is the maximum ejecta speed in free expansion .",
    "in addition , if we assume that the transverse velocity of the associated sgr or axp can not exceed @xmath82 , the minimum age is @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is angular offset of the pulsar from the center of the remnant . in this paper",
    "we will assume @xmath85 km s@xmath5 , which exceeds the observed velocity of any pulsar ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for the upper age limit of the snrs we choose @xmath86 kyr , which is the maximum estimated age for the snr / radio pulsar associations shown in table 3 . for each snr",
    ", we assume that the most likely age is the arithmetic mean of the age range , which is equivalent to assuming that the supernova rate is uniform in time throughout the galaxy .",
    "in figure @xmath87 we have plotted the snr shell radii @xmath88 as a function of the estimated age @xmath89 of each remnant associated with an sgr or axp . overplotted with solid lines are simple approximations of the evolutionary tracks ( @xcite ) of supernova remnant expansion in a wide range of the external ism densities @xmath90 , assuming a total supernova kinetic energy of @xmath91 ergs .",
    "these snr evolutionary tracks move through three phases : the initial free expansion / ejecta - dominated phase of the remnant , where the mass of the sn ejecta is much greater than the mass of the swept - up ism and @xmath92 ; the sedov / adiabatic phase , which begins when the mass of the swept - up ism is roughly @xmath93 of the mass of the sn ejecta , and the remnant slows down with @xmath94 ; and finally the radiative / snowplow phase , where the shell of swept - up ism radiates away the energy of the remnant and it slows further with @xmath95 ( e.g. @xcite ) . for individual supernova remnants , the tracks may differ by less than @xmath96 for a factor of three variation in supernova kinetic energies ( @xcite ) .",
    "also overplotted as dotted lines are the tracks of neutron stars born at the origin of the supernova explosion with varying velocities , showing the times required for them to catch up with the outer ( radio ) shell of the expanding remnant .",
    "we see from figure @xmath87 , that in spite of the uncertainties in the remnant ages and distances , all of the supernova shell remnants associated with sgrs and axps seem to reside in the denser ( @xmath97 @xmath26 ) phases of the ism , where @xmath98 of the neutron star producing supernovae occur .",
    "although the ages of the the snrs are highly uncertain , information on the progenitor ism density can be extracted from the snrs because densities inferred from the sedov and radiative phase expansion formulae depend much more strongly on the snr radii than on their ages . as we discuss in more detail below , the inferred distribution of progenitor ism densities is not consistent with an origin of sgrs and axps that results from a purely intrinsic property of the neutron stars , because such stars should predominantly be born in the hot , diffuse ( @xmath99 @xmath26 ) phase of the ism , where @xmath100 of the neutron star and pulsar producing sn occur .",
    "the probability of finding 10 such snrs out of 12 possible occurring in the denser ( @xmath97 @xmath26 ) phases of the ism , when at most @xmath101 are expected is only @xmath102{(0.2)}^{10 } { ( 0.8)}^{2 } \\sim 4\\times 10^{-6}$ ] .",
    "even if we assume the maximum @xmath103 probability for chance associations with snr for all sgrs and axps _ and _ assume that all chance associations will be in denser ism , the combined probability of any single , typical snr being in the denser ism is 0.33 , equalling @xmath104 naturally occurring plus @xmath105 occurring by chance .",
    "thus the probability of finding 10 out of 12 possible occurring in the denser ism is still only @xmath102{(0.33)}^{10 } { ( 0.67)}^{2}$ ] or @xmath106 .",
    "there are two obvious ways that the distribution of these snrs might be made consistent with that of typical neutron stars and pulsars , i.e. @xmath107 residing in the hot diffuse ism and @xmath108 in the dense ism .",
    "one way would be if the snr distances were systematically underestimated by roughly a factor of 3 , but as we saw in figure 1 and 2 , that is not consistent with galactic structure and would place roughly half of the snrs well outside the galaxy .",
    "alternatively , exceedingly weak ( @xmath109 ergs ) explosive energies for the sgr and axp supernovae could in principle explain the unusually compact remnants associated with sgrs and axps , but this is inconsistent with dynamical requirements of supernova explosions ( e.g. woosley & weaver 1995 ) , and with the direct observations of sgrs and axps associated snrs ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , there is direct evidence that at least 8 out of the 10 sgrs and axps associated snrs are indeed in dense environments .",
    "oh maser emission , attributed to snr shock interactions with molecular clouds , has been detected ( frail et al .",
    "1996 ; green et al .",
    "1997 ) from molecular clouds thought to be associated with five of the snrs ( ctb 33 , kes 73 , w28 , g10.00.3 , and g346.60.2 ) .",
    "ctb 109 ( e.g. huang & thaddeus 1985 ; tatematsu et al .",
    "1987 ) , g287.80.5 ( @xcite ) , and n49 ( @xcite ) also show evidence for molecular clouds associations .",
    "these associations with molecular clouds clearly show that the supernova remnant shells associated with sgrs and axps are expanding in high density environments .",
    "we can compare the observed properties of the snrs associated with sgrs and axps with the remnants associated with another population of young neutron stars ",
    "the young radio pulsars listed in the catalogs of taylor , manchester , & lyne ( 1993 ) and taylor et al .",
    "we consider only the youngest pulsars with timing ages less than @xmath110 kyr , so as to be comparable to the age range in the sgr / axp sample .",
    "the mdr timing ages of radio pulsars , unlike those for the sgrs and axps , are generally though to be good measures of their true ages ( e.g. @xcite ) , and we assume that the remnant ages are consistent with the mdr timing ages of their associated pulsars .",
    "a notable exception is psr j18012451 , which has an estimated age much greater than its mdr timing age ( @xcite )  possibly indicating the presence of non - mdr spin - down torques in this pulsar . for the pulsar distances , we use the distances",
    "derived ( @xcite ; @xcite ) from the measured dispersion and the taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) model of the free electron distribution in the galaxy .",
    "the supernova remnant shells of many of the young pulsars in table @xmath87 have not been detected in large scale radio surveys of the galactic plane ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , or in deep radio observations of the fields surrounding young pulsars ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "for these pulsars , we found no likely associated snrs in the green ( 2000 ) catalog within a search radius corresponding to a transverse velocity of as much as @xmath111 km s@xmath5 , assuming the estimated distances and timing ages for these sources listed in table @xmath42 . since the green ( 2000 ) snr catalog is more or less complete ( @xcite ) down to a limiting surface brightness , the missing snrs for these objects",
    "have probably expanded such that their surface brightnesses have faded below the limiting surface brightness of the radio surveys of the galactic plane .",
    "we therefore assume that the radio shells of the remnants associated with these pulsars ( except for the crab , for which we use a lower limit of @xmath112 pc for the remnant radius ; @xcite ) have expanded beyond this detectability threshold , and following braun , goss , & lyne ( 1989 ) we assign lower limits of @xmath86 pc to the undetected remnants corresponding to these pulsars .",
    "the observed and derived parameters for the young radio pulsars are listed in table @xmath87 , with references to the timing data , distances , and snr shell radii .",
    "a plot of the supernova remnant shell radii versus age for the radio pulsars is shown in figure @xmath113 .",
    "we clearly see from figure @xmath113 that most of the young pulsars appear to have been born in the hot , diffuse phase of the ism , as expected from other observations of their o and b star progenitors and their environments discussed in the preceding section .",
    "only @xmath114 of the @xmath115 young pulsars have snrs which may be expanding in the denser phases ( @xmath39 @xmath26 ) of the ism , which is consistent with the expected fraction of @xmath101 or less despite the small number statistics .",
    "these results are summarized in table @xmath113 .",
    "as seen from figures @xmath87 and @xmath113 , the sgrs and axps appear to form in denser regions of the interstellar medium than the sample of young radio pulsars .",
    "the significance of the apparent disparity between the sgr / axp and radio pulsar environments can be evaluated by using `` survival analysis '' ( @xcite ) methods , which are statistical techniques incorporating `` censored '' data ( e.g. upper limits ) into data analysis .",
    "we first convert the age and snr radii values of tables 1 and 3 to ambient ism densities @xmath90 using the standard formulae in shull ( 1983 ) and using values for each age and snr radius midway between the range of values listed in the tables .",
    "a total supernova kinetic energy of @xmath91 ergs was assumed for both the sgr / axps and radio pulsars .",
    "the lower limits on the radii of the undiscovered snrs in table 3 therefore became upper limits on the ambient densities for these snrs .",
    "the resulting distributions of @xmath90 for the sgr / axps and radio pulsars were then tested for consistency with a single parent sample using the statistical analysis package asurv rev 1.2 ( @xcite ) , which implements the methods presented in feigelson & nelson ( 1985 ) .",
    "the two - sample univariate nonparametric tests used to compare the distributions consisted of two versions of the gehan s generalized wilcoxon test ( permutation and hypergeometric variances ) , the logrank test , and the peto & peto and peto & prentice generalized wilcoxon tests ( see @xcite and references therein ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these methods differ in their assumptions regarding the censoring process and in the ways which they weight the data , but we found that they gave results which were consistent to within two orders of magnitude .",
    "we use the statistical tests to compute the probability @xmath116 that the distribution of @xmath90 for the sgrs and axps is consistent with the same distribution for the young radio pulsars . for the full sample of snr associations in table",
    "@xmath42 we calculate @xmath117 .",
    "if we exclude from the sample the objects with tentative snr associations ",
    "sgr 180123 and axps 170940 and 10485937  we find @xmath118 . finally ,",
    "if we change the maximum possible remnant age from @xmath86 kyr to @xmath3 kyr ( @xcite ) , we obtain @xmath119 for the full set of snr associations in table @xmath42 , and @xmath120 if we exclude the tentative snr associations .",
    "the data therefore supports the conclusion that the progenitors of sgrs and axps exploded in denser environments than the progenitors of radio pulsars .",
    "this conclusion can be alleviated only if one assumes that a large fraction of the previously claimed snr associations with axps and sgrs are spurious _ and _ the remnants truly associated with these objects have large diameters and are currently undetected . as discussed in @xmath13 , however , it is unlikely that more than a couple of the associations in table 1 are spurious , given the distribution of supernova remnants in the galactic plane .",
    "at least five of the snr associations in table @xmath42 would have to be spurious before one could conclude that the evidence for dense sgr and axp progenitor was insignificant ( i.e. the probability @xmath121 ) .",
    "the association of sgr 1900 + 14 with snr g42.8 + 0.6 has recently been questioned after the recent discovery ( @xcite ) of a 40 kyr old pulsar psr j1907 + 0918 equally close @xmath122 to the snr , and the discovery ( @xcite ) of a compact cluster of massive stars at an estimated distance ranging from @xmath43 to @xmath123 kpc , and only @xmath124 from the sgr 1900 + 14 line of sight .",
    "the relatively low h column depth from absorption in the sgr s x  ray spectrum ( @xcite ; @xcite ) clearly implies ( e.g. figure @xmath73 ) a distance closer to 5 kpc , so that the sgr and and snr may not be related to the cluster .",
    "if sgr 1900 + 14 is associated with the compact cluster at the more extreme distance , vrba et al.(2000 ) suggest an association with a possible compact ( @xmath125 pc diameter ) snr indicated by the local diffuse x  ray emission .",
    "this new sgr / snr association would therefore imply a much greater sgr 1900 + 14 progenitor density than the g42.8 + 0.6 association , increasing the evidence for dense progenitor environments for sgrs .",
    "a similar compact ( @xmath126 pc diameter ) cluster of massive stars has also been observed ( @xcite ) to be coincident with sgr 180620 and g10.00.3 . in addition , axp 10485937 and its associated snr g287.80.5 are associated with the carina star - forming region ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in these cases",
    "the associations with the clustered star - formation regions are quite consistent with the sgr / snr associations , since the distances of the star - forming regions and the snrs are comparable .",
    "the unusual properties of sgrs and axps may be due to the fact that they have unusually strong magnetic fields , as in the magnetar model ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the context of this model",
    ", it has been suggested that the association of sgrs and axps with dense progenitor environments may be explained by a selection effect in the following manner .",
    "magnetars are thought to form from progenitor stars with high angular momenta , such that the superstrong ( @xmath127 g ) magnetic field can be generated in the protoneutron star by dynamo action just after core collapse ( @xcite ) . since the total stellar angular momentum @xmath128 ( assuming rigid rotation , where @xmath129 is the observed rotational velocity )",
    ", one might expect the largest and most massive stars to be the likely progenitors of magnetars .",
    "furthermore , since the main sequence lifetimes of stars decrease with increasing mass , the more massive stars would be the first to supernovae  therefore exploding into more dense surroundings before the parent molecular cloud has been cleared by the successive supernovae of less massive stars .",
    "the two basic assumptions of this scenario do not appear to be consistent with observations .",
    "first , the observed stellar rotation velocities ( e.g. @xcite ) show that the angular velocity @xmath130 increases with stellar mass only up to about 2 m@xmath21 and then _ decreases _ with increasing mass , dropping to only @xmath108 of its maximum value for stellar masses @xmath131 .",
    "since the stellar evolution timescale even in massive stars is much longer than the convective timescale ( e.g. @xcite ) , the rotation of the star is effectively rigid and one would therefore expect the pre - collapse cores of the most massive stars to have less angular momenta than the cores of less massive supernova progenitors .",
    "this is supported by detailed calculations of the stellar evolution of rotating massive stars up to the time of core collapse ( @xcite ) , which indicate that the final angular momentum of the core region is less for a massive star than for a less massive star with the same initial rotation rate .",
    "this is due to the greatly increased mass losses of luminous massive stars , which shed angular momentum in their powerful stellar winds ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "second , the supernovae of massive stars would still not be expected to all explode in the denser medium , because star formation in massive ( @xmath18 10@xmath132 m@xmath21 ) clouds is episodic through several generations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these successive generations commence roughly every @xmath484 to 5 myr , over a period of @xmath4820 to 30 myr , each producing roughly 10@xmath133 o and b star supernova progenitors .",
    "each subsequent generation of star formation commences shortly after the onset of supernova explosions from the previous generation , at the end of their main sequence lifetimes of @xmath183 myr .",
    "therefore only the most massive stars in the first generation of star formation in a new star forming region would be expected to explode in denser environments , and the subsequent generations of massive stars should be born in the same low density superbubble environment as the population as a whole . thus even if magnetars were produced by the most massive stars , we still would not expect more than a small fraction of them to explode in the denser phases of the ism .",
    "the rapid spin - down rates , ages , clustered spin periods , and x  ray luminosities of axps and/or sgrs can all be explained by models involving the propeller effect as the dominant spin - down torque ( @xcite ; alpar 2000 ; chatterjee , hernquist & narayan 2000 ; chatterjee & hernquist 2000 ) . in the context of these models , sgr bursts can be explained in terms of solid body accretion ( @xcite ; @xcite ) or crustal instabilities ( @xcite ) . because there are upper limits on the masses of the possible binary companions of at least some of the axps ( e.g. @xcite ) , the accreted material is probably ejecta from the neutron star s own supernova explosion ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , since some of the sgrs and axps are located outside their apparent supernova remnants , the accreted material must form an accretion disk which can store the angular momentum of the accreted material and spin - down the neutron star on time scales of @xmath134 kyr .",
    "upper limits on the disk emission from the nearby axp 2259 + 58.6 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) may rule out a standard hydrogen accretion disk around this axp , but a disk may still exist given the uncertainties in the spectra of disks formed from metal - rich supernova ejecta and dust ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the noisy spin - down of sgr 180620 ( @xcite ) and the @xmath135 kev emission feature ( @xcite ) observed from an sgr 1900 + 14 burst are both consistent with accretion disks around these objects .",
    "there are two possible scenarios involving accretion from the ejecta of the supernova explosion which produces the neutron star : fallback disk accretion , `` pushback '' disk accretion , and accretion involving high velocity neutron stars .",
    "it was recently proposed that axps may be formed from neutron stars accreting material from `` fallback '' accretion disks ( chatterjee , hernquist & narayan 2000 ; chatterjee & hernquist 2000 ) .",
    "these disks may be formed from @xmath136 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) of inner ejecta material @xmath137 hours after the initial core collapse in a type ii supernova explosion ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . since a total accreted mass of only @xmath138",
    "is required to explain the spin - down of sgrs and axps via the propeller mechanism ( e.g. alpar 2000 ; chatterjee , hernquist & narayan 2000 ; chatterjee & hernquist 2000 ) , only a very small fraction ( @xmath139 ) of the fallback material must be accreted into a disk for this model to explain spin - down rates and ages of the sgrs and axps .",
    "formation of such a fallback disk is limited to @xmath140 days after the core collapse because of heating of the ejecta by @xmath141ni ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is long before the remnant feels the external environment early in the sedov phase , and therefore formation of an early fallback disk may not be compatible with the evidence for dense sgr and axp progenitor environments",
    ".    a model involving fallback disks which form later in the evolution of the snr , however , could be consistent with the evidence of dense sgr and axp environments .",
    "in particular , the expansion of slow - moving ejecta can be reversed by the sedov phase reverse shock resulting from the interaction between the blastwave and the external medium ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the subsequent implosion could result in the formation of a `` pushback '' disk ",
    "so named because the snr ejecta is pushed - back onto the star because of the interaction with the dense environment surrounding the progenitor .",
    "pushback disk formation would probably be most likely for : 1 ) neutron star progenitors which experienced a large amount of mass loss prior to supernova , and 2 ) progenitors in the dense ism , which would provide the necessary pressure to confine the wind mass near the star .",
    "this is exemplified by the circumstellar environments surrounding the progenitor of sn 1987a , which is surrounded by @xmath142 in wind material and hii gas ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the pushback process begins at the `` reversal time '' @xmath143 kyr ( @xcite ) , and the pushback mass is @xmath144 given a total ejecta mass of @xmath145 .",
    "as with the fallback disks discussed above , the formation of a pushback disk from only a small fraction of this matter would be required to explain the spin - down of sgrs and axps . since this later",
    "fallback occurs after the majority of @xmath141ni and @xmath141co decays , the formation of the accretion disk around the neutron star would not be limited by radioactive heating .",
    "such a model may be a plausible explanation for the dense sgr and axp environments , and needs to be explored in more detail .",
    "the final propeller - based scenario for sgrs and axps involves high velocity neutron stars ( hvnss ) capturing disk material from co - moving supernova ejecta , as first suggested van paradijs , taam , and van den heuvel ( 1995 ) . although the exact mechanism by which neutron stars are given substantial `` kick '' velocities at birth is not known , observations show that the kick velocities exceed @xmath146 km s@xmath5 in approximately @xmath108 of all neutron stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , this kick velocity appears to be independent of the dipole moment of the neutron star , as indicated by population studies of isolated radio pulsars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and observations of extremely high velocity stars with canonical neutron star magnetic fields of @xmath11 g ( e.g. psr b2224@xmath5265 : @xcite ) . as implied by the ratio @xmath147 listed in table @xmath42 , many of the sgr / axp positions",
    "are significantly displaced from the apparent centers of their associated snrs .",
    "these displacements imply that the sgr / axps may have systematically large transverse velocities , although there is considerable uncertainty in the actual velocities , mainly because of uncertainties in the ages of the associated remnants .",
    "in addition , the actual space velocities of the sgr / axps are larger by an unknown factor dependent on the viewing angle .",
    "it has been estimated ( @xcite ) that a @xmath148 accretion disk may be acquired by a high velocity neutron star as it moves through nearly co - moving supernova ejecta .",
    "however detailed calculations of the time - dependent accretion rate for the range of ism densities , progenitor mass loss parameters , and neutron star magnetic fields , initial spin periods , and velocities are needed to properly constrain such a model .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the present paper , and will be left for future work .    additional evidence in favor of the pushback disk and hvns models for sgrs and axps may be provided by the observed number of these sources .",
    "for the pushback disk model , the number of sgrs and axps less than @xmath89 years old is given by @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is the galactic neutron star birthrate , @xmath151 is the fraction of neutron star progenitors in the warm dense ism , and @xmath152 is the fraction of neutron star progenitors which experience mass loss sufficient to form a pushback disk in dense ism environments . since the rate of mass loss from stellar winds is an increasing function of the initial main sequence mass , the fraction @xmath152 can be estimated by considering the _ minimum _ stellar mass which undergoes pre - supernova mass loss sufficient to decelerate its supernova ejecta at early times .",
    "to first order , this should occur when the total wind mass emitted during the progenitor s life is approximately equal to the supernova ejecta mass . from the solar metallicity stellar models of schaller",
    "1992 )  which include mass loss  this occurs for stars of initial main sequence masses greater than @xmath153 . using @xmath154 and a salpeter imf with a maximum and minimum neutron star progenitor mass of @xmath155 and @xmath156 , respectively ( @xcite ) , we obtain @xmath157 . assuming @xmath158 ( as discussed in @xmath12 ) and @xmath159 yr@xmath5 ( @xcite ) , we obtain @xmath160 sgrs and axps with ages less than @xmath161 kyr .",
    "this is similar to the observed number ( @xmath43 ) of these sources , which can be taken as evidence supporting the pushback disk model .",
    "a similar calculation is possible for the hvns model . in this case , the expected number of sgrs and axps less than @xmath89 years old is given by @xmath162 , where @xmath163 of neutron stars with high space velocities and @xmath150 and @xmath151 are defined as before . using the same values of @xmath151 and @xmath150 , and assuming @xmath164 ( velocities @xmath4 km s@xmath5 ; @xcite ) , yields @xmath165 expected sgr and axp sources with ages less than @xmath86 kyr for the hvns model .",
    "again , these numbers are in the right ballpark for the observed numbers of sgrs and axps .",
    "we have shown that soft gamma ",
    "ray repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x  ray pulsars ( axps ) are born in regions of the interstellar medium which are denser than the environments typical of young neutron stars .",
    "this suggests that the development of sgrs and axps may be related to their environments , and we examine the implications of this on magnetar and propeller - based models for sgrs and axps",
    ". the evidence of dense progenitor environments would be consistent with the magnetar model only if magnetars are born exclusively in dense environments , which does not appear to be the case if magnetars form only from the most massive stars .",
    "propeller - based models for sgrs and axps involving the formation of accretion disks from supernova ejecta appear to be consistent with the evidence for dense progenitor environments since these environments may induce the formation of such disks .",
    "this may occur in two ways .",
    "_ pushback _ disks may be formed from the infall of the innermost ejecta , pushed back towards the neutron stars by prompt reverse shocks from the interactions of the expanding remnants with massive progenitor winds confined close to the stars by dense surrounding gas  producing rapid deceleration of the expanding ejecta and strong prompt reverse shocks ( truelove & mckee 1999 ) .",

    "_ axp 0142@xmath52615 _ : this apparently old ( possibly @xmath224 kyr ) and well - studied ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) axp has no remnant within @xmath225 of it in the green ( 2000 ) catalog .",
    "but there is evidence ( @xcite ) that this source is in or behind a giant molecular cloud .",
    "given the rapid evolution ( e.g. @xcite ) and possible self - absorption ( @xcite ) of the radio emission of snrs in dense environments , the associated snr may have faded below detectability , and therefore we are unable to constrain the radius of the associated remnant .",
