    "<S> july 2002    exactly solved vertex models play a fundamental role in classical statistical mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> the most important of these is the so - called eight - vertex model which contains as special cases most systems on a plane square lattice @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the general asymmetric eight - vertex model possesses six different boltzmann weights @xmath0 and @xmath1 whose transfer matrix can be written as @xmath2\\ ] ] where the trace is over the ordered product of local operators @xmath3 which are given by the following @xmath4 matrix @xmath5 and @xmath6 are pauli matrices acting on the sites @xmath7 of an one - dimensional lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetric eight - vertex model is known to be solvable in the manifolds @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are arbitrary constants .    </S>",
    "<S> the manifold ( 3 ) is the so - called free - fermion model whose free - energy was first calculated by fan and wu @xcite and later re - derived by felderhof @xcite who devised a method to diagonalize the corresponding transfer matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the integrability of the free - fermion manifold is usually assumed from the fact that its transfer matrix commutes with the @xmath13 hamiltonian as shown by krinsky @xcite who used a procedure first developed by sutherland @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> later on barouch @xcite and kasteleyn @xcite have revisited the problem of commuting asymmetric eight - vertex transfer matrices and generalized heisenberg hamiltonians which leaded kasteleyn @xcite to point out the existence of the manifolds ( 4 ) . as stressed by this author , however , such manifolds are trivial because they can be seen as set of independent one - dimensional models and therefore they should be disregarded . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the solution of the symmetric manifold was found by baxter through quite general approach denominated commuting transfer matrix method which culminated in the famous `` star - triangle '' relations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the symmetric eight - vertex transfer matrix commutes with a related @xmath14 hamiltonian @xcite has then been made more precise because the latter is essentially a logarithmic derivative of the former @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it would be quite desirable to extend the baxter s method to the asymmetric eight - vertex model and to rederive the manifolds ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) from a unified point of view . since this approach does not assume a priori the existence of a specific local form for the corresponding hamiltonian it can lead us to new integrable manifolds not covered by the analysis of barouch @xcite and kasteleyn @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we recall that much of the work on this problem , see e.g. refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , has been concentrated to analyze the yang - baxter equations directly in terms of spectral parameters . though this is a valid approach it often hides the general integrable manifolds in terms of specific parameterizations which need to be found by a posteriori guess - work . a more direct way would be first to determine the solvable manifolds by an algebraic study  la baxter of the corresponding `` star - triangle '' equations and afterwards to parameterize them by using the theory of uniformization of biquadratic polynomials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that kasteleyn @xcite was the first to make an effort toward such analysis but the best he could do was to guess the manifold ( 3 ) from known results by felderhof besides clarifying the origin of the pseudo one - dimensional manifold ( 4 ) as the linearization of the yang - baxter equation around a non - identity @xmath15 @xmath16-matrix . since the later possibility leads us to trivial manifolds we will disregard it , as did kasteleyn , from our forthcoming analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> the probable reason that such generalization has not yet been carried out seen technical since in the asymmetric model we have to deal with the double number of equations as compared to the symmetric eight - vertex model . at first sight </S>",
    "<S> this appears to be a cumbersome task , but here we show that it is possible to simplify this problem , without recoursing to computer manipulations , to a number of simple equations that will clarify the common origin of the above two integrable manifolds . besides that , this approach allows to show that manifold ( 3 ) is one between three possible different integrable branches satisfying the free - fermion condition . </S>",
    "<S> the `` star - triangle '' relations are sufficient conditions @xcite for commuting transfer matrices and for the asymmetric eight - vertex model they are given by @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22    note that each of these equations possesses two possibilities and we shall denote them by eqs.(@xmath23,@xmath24,@xmath25 ) . </S>",
    "<S> altogether we have twelve linear homogeneous equations and only six weights , say @xmath26 and @xmath27 , are at our disposal to be eliminated in terms of remaining set of weights @xmath28 and @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we have to choose the appropriate equations to start with and our solution goes as follows . </S>",
    "<S> we first eliminate the weights @xmath30 with the help of the pair of equations ( @xmath31,@xmath32 ) and by substituting the result in eqs.(@xmath23 ) we find the following relations @xmath33\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    next we apply similar procedure in the case of eqs.(@xmath34,@xmath35 ) and the corresponding relations between the weights @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are @xmath39\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from eqs.(@xmath40 ) it is not difficult to eliminate the weights @xmath36 , leading us to constraints between @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xmath41= d^{\"}\\left[a_{\\mp}b_{\\mp}f(a_{\\pm}^{'},b_{\\pm}^{'},c^{'},d^{'})-a_{\\pm}^ { ' } b_{\\pm}^{'}f(a_{\\pm},b_{\\pm},c , d ) \\right]\\ ] ]    at this point it is tempting to use such equations and the previous results for @xmath30 and @xmath36 to eliminate five weights ratios and to substitute them in the remaining equations , namely eqs.(@xmath25 ) and either eqs.(@xmath42 ) or eqs.(@xmath43 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is , however , not so illuminating because it leads us to carry out simplifications in complicated expressions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that it is more profitable to repeat the procedure described above but now we first eliminate the weights @xmath44 and in the end we use eqs.(@xmath25 ) instead of eqs.(@xmath23 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this leads us to a different constraint between @xmath37 and @xmath38 given by , @xmath45= c^{\"}\\left[a_{\\mp}b_{\\mp}f(a_{\\pm}^{'},b_{\\pm}^{'},c^{'},d^{'})-a_{\\mp}^ { ' } b_{\\mp}^{'}f(a_{\\pm},b_{\\pm},c , d ) \\right]\\ ] ]    now we reached a point that enables us to make conclusions on the way the set of weights @xmath46 and @xmath47 should be related to each other . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , from eqs.(@xmath48,@xmath49 ) we find that the necessary conditions for the weights @xmath37 and @xmath38 not to be all zero are @xmath50 and either @xmath51 or @xmath52    we are already in the position to conclude that the asymmetric eight - vertex model has indeed only two possible integrable manifolds , one is singled out by the free - fermion condition ( 17 ) while the other ( 18 ) turns out to be a mixed type of conditions that relate the set of weights both alone and between each other . </S>",
    "<S> one important point of our analysis is that it makes clear that both manifolds need to share a common invariant given by eq.(16 )    to close our analysis it remains to check the consistency between eqs.(@xmath23 ) and eqs.(@xmath25 ) which can in principle be a source of further constraints . from such equations </S>",
    "<S> one can easily calculate the ratios @xmath53 and @xmath54 , namely @xmath55 @xmath56 which in principle can be compared with our previous results for the same ratios .    before proceeding with that , </S>",
    "<S> however , there exists one property that we have not yet explored . instead of starting our analysis by eliminating the weights @xmath57,@xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 we could choose to begin with the other two sets of weights as well . </S>",
    "<S> because the `` star - triangle '' equations are not symmetric by exchanging a given two sets of weights we expect that each possibility will leads us to different kind of constraints . </S>",
    "<S> this means that we can use the asymmetry of the weights in our favour which may help us in further simplifications . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the relations ( @xmath23-@xmath25 ) are invariant under the exchange of weights @xmath58 and @xmath59 only after the transformation @xmath60 is performed for all set of weights . </S>",
    "<S> this means that if we had started our procedure by eliminating the weights @xmath61 and @xmath1 the same analysis we have carried out so far will lead us to the following constraints @xmath62 besides that either @xmath63 or @xmath64    by the same token if we had started by eliminating @xmath65 and @xmath66 we will find @xmath67 and that either @xmath68 or @xmath69    let us now analyze the consequences of this observation for each possible integrable manifold and here we begin with the second manifold . </S>",
    "<S> it is not difficult to see that the consistency of the equations ( 18),(23 ) and ( 26 ) , to what concern relations within the same set of weights , impose severe restrictions on the second type of the manifold , namely @xmath70 and similar conditions for the other sets @xmath71 and @xmath72 .    </S>",
    "<S> it turns out , however , that the only possibility compatible with the `` universal '' constraints ( 16 ) , ( 21 ) and ( 24 ) is the totally symmetric case @xmath73 and @xmath74 leading us therefore to the baxter s model ( 5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that in this situation the compatibility between eq(@xmath23 ) and eq.(@xmath25 ) is trivial because both equations ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) are automatically satisfied .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn our attention to the free - fermion manifold . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we have much less restrictive constraints since we are only left with relations between different weights , namely eqs.(16,21,24 ) . </S>",
    "<S> altogether these equations provide us the following relation @xmath75 whose compatibility with eqs.(@xmath23,@xmath25 ) can be implemented by evaluating the left - hand side of eq.(28 ) with the help of eqs.(19,20 ) . </S>",
    "<S> after few manipulations , in which the free - fermion condition is explicitly used , we end up with a `` separable '' equation @xmath76 for the weights @xmath59 and @xmath77 and the polynomial @xmath78 is given by @xmath79 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times \\left [ a_{-}b_{+}a_{-}^{'}b_{+}^{'}-a_{+}b_{-}a_{+}^{'}b_{-}^ { ' }   \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times \\left [ ( a_{+}^{2}+b_{-}^2-a_{-}^2-b_{+}^2)(a_{+}^{'}b_{-}^ { ' } + a_{-}^{'}b_{+}^ { ' } ) - ( a_{+}b_{- } + a_{-}b_{+ } ) ( { a_{+}^{'}}^{2}+{b_{-}^{'}}^2-{a_{-}^{'}}^2-{b_{+}^{'}}^2 ) \\right ]   \\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from this equation we conclude that we have three possible free - fermion integrable manifolds given by either @xmath80 or @xmath81 or still @xmath82 besides of course the free - fermion conditions for both @xmath59 and @xmath83 together with the `` universal '' relation ( 16 ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the free - fermion case ( 31 ) can not be related to the manifold ( 4 ) beginning by the fact that in the former model the weight @xmath84 can be different of the weight @xmath1 .    in figure 1 </S>",
    "<S> we have summarized all the results obtained so far . </S>",
    "<S> let us now compare our results with previous work in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to what happened to the symmetric manifold ( 5 ) we recall that eqs.(30,31 ) do not imply that the ratios @xmath85 and @xmath86 are necessarily constants but only that they are invariants for two distinct set of weights .. ] this is the reason why general solutions of the yang - baxter equation satisfying the free - fermion condition are expected to be non - additive @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , in the appendix @xmath87 we show that the additional assumption of additivity provides us extra restriction to the weights . in this sense , </S>",
    "<S> the manifold ( 30 ) turns out to be a generalization of the original result ( 3 ) by krinsky @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> next the manifold ( 31 ) has been only partially obtained in the literature , more precisely in the special case @xmath73 and @xmath88 @xcite and @xmath74 is contained in the baxter s solution . ] . </S>",
    "<S> finally , to the best of our knowledge the last branch ( 32 ) is new in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> the probable reason that such general manifolds have been missed in previous work , see for example refs.@xcite , is related to analysis of the yang - baxter equation in terms of spectral parameters . </S>",
    "<S> there it was required that at certain value of the spectral parameter ( initial condition ) the weights should be regular , i.e that the corresponding @xmath89 operator be proportional to the four dimensional permutator . </S>",
    "<S> note that the @xmath89 operator of manifold ( 32 ) can not be made regular and therefore does not have a local associated hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> this is also the reason barouch @xcite and kasteleyn @xcite missed such manifold since they used the assumption of local forms of hamiltonians . </S>",
    "<S> we recall that though the property of regularity guarantees that the logarithmic derivative of the transfer matrix is @xmath90 this is by no means a necessary condition for integrability .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have analyzed according to baxter the integrable branches of the asymmetric eight - vertex model . besides recovering the baxter s model we shown that the free - fermion condition produces three different set of integrable manifolds . a natural question to be asked </S>",
    "<S> is whether or not the new manifolds ( 31 ) and ( 32 ) can be solved by the method devised by felderhof originally proposed to diagonalize the transfer matrix of the krinsky s manifold ( 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is of interest since these systems maybe the corner stone of highly non trivial models as recently have been discussed in refs.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we have evidences that the manifold ( 31 ) is related to a staggered @xmath13 model . because both the baxter symmetric model and the free - fermion manifolds ( 30 - 32 ) share a common algebraic structure , the yang - baxter algebra , it is plausible to think that baxter s generalized bethe ansatz can be adapted to include the solution of the free - fermion models too . </S>",
    "<S> this problem has eluded us so far though some progress has been made in the case of the simplest free - fermion branch ( 31 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> * appendix a *    the purpose here is to demonstrate that the hypothesis of additivity of the weights leads us to much more restrictive conditions for the free - fermion manifold as compared with the results ( 30 - 32 ) of the main text . in order to see that lets us consider as usual that the weights @xmath91 are parameterized by the variables @xmath92 and @xmath93 and similarly that @xmath94 and @xmath95 are parameterized by @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the consistency between the `` universal '' relations ( 16 ) , ( 21 ) and ( 24 ) implies a remarkable separability condition for the ratio @xmath98 where @xmath99 is an arbitrary function .    the additional assumption that the weights are additive means that this function is necessarily a constant which ultimately leads us to the relation @xmath100    as a consequence of that the possible manifolds satisfying the the free - fermion condition are either @xmath73 or @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> now by imposing the consistency between eqs(@xmath23 ) and eqs.(@xmath25 ) it turns out that these two possibilities becomes either @xmath101 or @xmath102 where @xmath103 is a constant </S>",
    "<S> .    clearly , these are special cases of the manifolds ( 31 ) and ( 30 ) , respectively . </S>"
