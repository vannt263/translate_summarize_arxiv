    "many papers have appeared on this topic and the original definition has been generalized in a number of different ways . for simplicial complexes and simplicial maps , the notion of _ contiguity _ is considered as the discrete version of homotopy .",

    "given a finite topological space @xmath1 there exists the associated simplicial complex @xmath2 , where the simplices are its non - empty chains ; and , conversely , given a finite simplicial complex @xmath3 there is a finite space @xmath4 , the poset of simplices of @xmath3 , such that @xmath5 , the first barycentric subdivision of @xmath3 . by these constructions",
    "we can see posets and simplicial complexes as essentially equivalent objects .    in this work",
    "we introduce a natural notion of ls - category @xmath6 for any simplicial complex @xmath3 . unlike other topological notions established for the geometric realization of the complex",
    ", our approach is directly based on the simplicial structure . in this context , _",
    "contiguity classes _ are the combinatorial analogues of homotopy classes . for instance , different simplicial approximations to the same continuous map are contiguous and the geometric realizations of contiguous maps are homotopic .",
    "analogously to the topological setting , it is desirable that this notion of category be a homotopy invariant . in order to obtain this goal , the notion of strong collapse introduced by minian and barmak @xcite is used instead of the classical notion of collapse .",
    "the existence of _ cores _ or _ minimal _ complexes is a fundamental difference between strong homotopy types and simple homotopy types .",
    "a simplicial complex can collapse to non - isomorphic subcomplexes .",
    "however if a complex @xmath3 strongly collapses to a minimal complex @xmath7 , it must be unique , up to isomorphism .",
    "we prove the homotopical invariance of simplicial category , and , in particular , that @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , a notion of _ geometric category _ @xmath9",
    "is introduced in the simplicial context . for topological spaces",
    "geometric category is not a homotopical invariant , so it is customary to consider the minimum value of @xmath10 , for all spaces @xmath11 of the same homotopy type as @xmath1 .",
    "this process leads to a homotopical invariant , @xmath12 , first introduced by ganea @xcite . in the simplicial context",
    "we prove several results about the behaviour of @xmath9 under strong collapses .",
    "other authors @xcite have considered a notion of geometric category for simple collapses .",
    "the essential difference is that for @xmath13 one can consider not only the minimum value in the homotopy class , but also the maximum , which coincides with the category of the _ core _ of the complex .    by means of the equivalence between simplicial complexes and finite topological spaces ,",
    "we get a notion of ls - category of finite spaces which corresponds with the classical notion , because the concept of strong homotopy equivalence in the simplicial context corresponds to the notion of homotopy equivalence in the setting of finite spaces . under this point of view",

    "section 3 is focused on the study of the simplicial ls - category @xmath6 of a simplicial complex @xmath3 .",
    "we prove that this notion is a homotopy invariant , that is , two strongly equivalent complexes have the same category . the corresponding notion of geometrical category @xmath14 for a simplicial complex @xmath3 is studied in section 4 .",
    "we obtain that the geometrical category increases under strong collapses , and that the maximum value is obtained for the core @xmath7 of the complex .",
    "section 5 contains a study on the ls - category of finite topological spaces .",
    "notice that it is not the ls - category of the geometric realization @xmath15 of the associated simplicial complex , but it is the category of the topological space @xmath1 itself .",
    "we have not found any specific study of ls - category for finite topological spaces in the literature .",
    "for instance , we prove that the number of maximal elements minus one is an upper bound of the category of a finite topological space . by analogy with the ls - category of simplicial complexes we establish other results for finite spaces .",

    "in particular , we exhibit a new example showing that geometrical category is not a homotopy invariant .",
