    "thermodynamics of black holes plays a central role in the attractive modern method relating classical gravity and high energy physics namely gauge / gravity duality .",
    "the issue was first taken under consideration by bekenstein @xcite and hawking @xcite and encountered increasing interests rapidly . among different frameworks ,",
    "the thermodynamics of black solutions has been studied within , dilaton gravity possesses a significant predominancy .",
    "this preference has at least two reasons . from one side , the dilaton gravity which is one of the modified gravities , is able to justify the accelerating expansion of the universe confirmed from observations expuni while einstein gravity ( general relativity ) requires exotic matter violating energy conditions to justify this phase of universe . from another side",
    ", the dilaton gravity appears in the low energy limit of string theory @xcite and therefore can provide a good laboratory for testing this theory in the low energy limit through gauge / gravity duality .",
    "since string theory proposes higher than four dimensions @xcite , it is natural to consider higher - dimensional solutions within the gravity theories come from string theory .",
    "exact asymptotically flat solutions of einstein - maxwell - dilaton gravity have been constructed in the absence of dilaton potential in gibbons , gar , mig , pol . however , breaking of spacetime supersymmetry in ten dimensions may cause one or more liouville - type potentials in the action of dilaton gravity .",
    "this type of dilaton potential change the asymptotic behavior of solutions @xcite .",
    "in general , these solutions are neither asymptotically flat nor ( anti ) de sitter [ ( a)ds ] .",
    "thermodynamics of topological dilaton black holes in einstein - maxwell gravity has been explored in @xcite .",

    "have been studied from thermodynamics point of view as well @xcite .",
    "a natural interesting extension of such solutions is to change the electrodynamics lagrangian from linear maxwell to nonlinear ones .",
    "some efforts have been done to construct exact solution in dilaton gravity with nonlinear electrodynamics .",
    "for example , thermodynamics of static black hole solutions in the presence of nonlinear power - law maxwell ( plm ) @xcite , born - infeld ( bi ) @xcite and exponential @xcite electrodynamics have been investigated . as well , thermodynamic properties of rotating black brane solutions have been studied in the presence of plm rotplm , bi",
    "@xcite and exponential @xcite nonlinear electrodynamics . any one of the above mentioned nonlinear electrodynamics has its own importance and motivations .",
    "for instance , the plm electrodynamics extends the conformal invariance property of linear maxwell lagrangian in four dimensions to higher dimensional spacetimes , while bi @xcite electrodynamics , which comes from open string theory @xcite , solves the problem of infinite self - energy of charged point - particle that appears in linear maxwell case .",
    "the latter problem is also overcome by logarithmic nonlinear electrodynamics proposed for the first time in soleng .",
    "although this type of nonlinear electrodynamics has no direct relation with superstring theory , it can be motivated from different sides .",
    "first , it can be regarded as a toy model showing that certain nonlinear field theories can produce particle - like solutions that can realize the limiting curvature hypothesis in cosmological theories @xcite .",
    "second , the behavior of logarithmic electrodynamics and bi electrodynamics lagrangians are the same for large values of nonlinear parameter @xmath3 .",
    "third , from gauge / gravity duality point of view , the ratio of holographic viscosity to entropy density is not affected by nonlinear terms rise from a nonlinear electrodynamics in contrast with gravitational corrections vis .",
    "fourth , the values of important parameters of a holographic superconductor system such as critical temperature and order parameter are firmly sensitive to choice of electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "other studies on the nonlinear electrodynamics have been carried out in frad , cal , hendi , hendislowly , sheyhaj , sheykaz , shey1,dhsr .",

    "we found that the presence of the dilaton field changes the asymptotic behavior of the obtained solutions to be neither flat nor ( a)ds . we presented the suitable counterterm which remove the divergences of the action in the presence of the dilaton field . in the absence of a non - trivial dilaton ( @xmath102 ) , these solutions reduce to the asymptotically ads charged rotating black brane solutions of einstein theory in the presence of logarithmic nonlinear electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "when @xmath196 , these solutions reduce to the charged rotating dilaton black brane solutions given in ref .",
    "we also calculated the conserved and thermodynamic quantities of the spacetime such as mass , angular momentum , temperature , entropy and electric potential and checked that the first law of thermodynamics holds on the black brane horizon .",
    "then , we explored thermal stability of the nonlinearly charged rotating black brane solutions in both canonical and grand - canonical ensembles .",
    "we found that in both ensembles the solutions are thermally stable for @xmath182 , while for @xmath184 the solutions are always thermally unstable in the grand - canonical ensemble where @xmath10 is the dilaton - electromagnetic coupling constant . in the canonical ensemble , however , we can have both stable and unstable solutions for @xmath184 .",
    "we found that , in this ensemble , there is an @xmath197 for which the solutions are thermally stable provided @xmath198 .",
    "the pointed out results implies that the thermal stability is ensemble - dependent and @xmath10 influences the stability under thermal perturbations .",
    "these results are expectable since different ensembles allow different sets of quantities to be variable and a thermally stable system is one which is stable under varying variable quantities . on the other hand , values",
    "of conserved and thermodynamic quantities depend on values of parameters such as @xmath10  and therefore the fact that dilaton - electromagnetic coupling has direct effect on thermal stability of the system seems natural .",
    "it is notable to mention that in this paper , we only constructed the charged rotating dilaton black branes of nonlinear electrodynamics with flat horizon .",
    "one can try to construct the rotating dilaton black holes of this theory with curved horizon .",
    "one can laso investigate the thermodynamic geometry of these solutions .",
    "the latter issue is now under investigation and the results will be presented elsewhere .",
