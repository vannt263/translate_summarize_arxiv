    "nachman s work paved the way for rigorous results : all studies about diagram ( [ diagram ] ) published before @xcite were formal as they had to assume the absence of exceptional points without specifying acceptable initial data . in 2007 , @xcite established for smooth , compactly supported conductivity - type initial data with @xmath93 outside supp@xmath94 that there is a well - defined continuous function @xmath95 from the inverse scattering method satisfying the estimate @xmath96 for all @xmath97 .",

    "perry @xcite showed that , if @xmath88 is a sufficiently smooth critical potential , the nv equation with initial data @xmath88 has a solution global in time .",
    "there is strong evidence to suggest that a similar result can be proved for the nv equation with subcritical initial data , based on the work of music @xcite .",
    "thus , it remains to understand the singularities of the scattering transform for supercritical potentials .",
    "examples due to grinevich and novikov @xcite and music , perry and siltanen @xcite show that supercritical potentials may have circles of exceptional points .",
    "it is not known whether supercritical potentials _ must _ or _ may _ have exceptional points , nor is it known how to extend the inverse scattering formalism to potentials with nonempty exceptional sets",
    ". the following result due to brown , music , and perry @xcite gives an initial constraint on the size of exceptional sets for particularly nice potentials .",
    "[ thm : bmp ] @xcite suppose that @xmath2 is a real - valued measurable valued function with the property that @xmath161 for some constants @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "then the exceptional set of @xmath2 consists at most of isolated points together with at most finitely many smooth curves with at most finitely many intersections .    to analyze the exceptional set ,",
    "the authors define a renormalized determinant whose zero set is exactly the exceptional set . to describe it ,",
    "let @xmath164 is the integral operator @xmath165 the differential equation for @xmath155 , the ncgo solution , may be rewritten @xmath166 .",
    "hence , uniqueness of solutions is equivalent to invertibility of @xmath167 , and the exceptional set is exactly the set of points @xmath104 for which @xmath167 fails to be invertible . it can be shown that @xmath164 is a compact linear operator from @xmath168 to itself for any @xmath169 , and that @xmath164 belongs to the so - called mikhlin - itskovich algebra of integral operators on @xmath168 .",
    "for this reason we can apply the theory renormalized determinants due to gohberg , goldberg , and krupnik @xcite and define @xmath170 where the determinant @xmath171 is the renormalized determinant .",
    "brown , music , and perry show that this determinant is a real - analytic function of @xmath104 for exponentially decaying potentials .",
    "it now follows from the weierstrass preparation theorem that the zero set of @xmath172 is locally the zero set of a polynomial .",
    "since the exceptional set is known to be closed and bounded , one can completely analyze the behavior of @xmath172 near the exceptional set using finitely many such local representations .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath172 is also real - valued , from which it follows that the zero set has the claimed form .",
    "theorem [ thm : bmp ] opens up several areas for further investigation .",
    "first , it would be of considerable interest to determine what additional data is needed to reconstruct a potential from @xmath105 when @xmath105 has point or line singularities .",
    "second , it would be very interesting to know whether singularities are always present for supercritical potentials , or whether , on the other hand , singularities are generically absent .",
    "third , our understanding of the nv equation and its dynamics would be greatly improved by connecting ` spectral ' properties of the scattering transform ( i.e. , the nature of its singularities ) to long - term behavior of solutions .",
    "the form of the time evolution for @xmath105 suggests that the ` trichotomy ' of subcritical , critical , and supercritical potentials is invariant under the nv flow .",
    "it is known that critical initial data give rise to global solutions ( see @xcite ) , and there is strong evidence that the same is true of subcritical initial data . on the other hand ,",
    "numerical experiments such as the ring soliton , example 4.3 , and analytical solutions such as those produced by taimanov and tsarev @xcite strongly suggest that supercritical initial data lead to solutions of nv that blow up in finite time .",
    "it would be very interesting to obtain a rigorous proof that this is the case , and to analyze the nature of the blow - ups by inverse scattering methods .",
    "in the direct scattering problem at zero energy , faddeev s green s function plays a critical role in elucidating properties of the cgo solutions that define the scattering transform . recall that the normalized cgo solutions solve the equation @xmath173 and that faddeev s green s function is green s function for the operator @xmath174 . on the other hand ,",
    "the solid cauchy transform is an inverse for the @xmath4 operator with range in @xmath168 functions for @xmath169 , and hence is a fundamental tool for solving the @xmath4 problem that defines the inverse scattering transform .",
    "finally , the beurling transform is an integral operator which gives a meaning to the operator @xmath175 that occurs in the definition of the nonlinearity in the nv equation .",
    "here we collect some useful properties of faddeev s green s function and the cauchy and beurlng transforms , and recall some essential estimates .",
    "recall that @xmath176 is defined by the formula@xmath177 where @xmath178 , @xmath179 , @xmath180 , and @xmath181 . by the hausdorff - young inequality , @xmath182 for any @xmath169 .",
    "in fact , the estimate@xmath183 ( see siltanen @xcite , theorem 3.10 ) holds for any @xmath184 .",
    "it is important to note that@xmath185 the following large-@xmath85 asymptotic expansion of @xmath186 is proved in @xcite , theorem 3.11 .",
    "let @xmath178 with @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",

    ".    since the error estimate ( [ eq : g1.err ] ) does not depend on the condition @xmath188 , and since @xmath194 is continuous , we can conclude that the expansion ( [ eq : g1.exp ] ) remains valid for @xmath187 and @xmath195 .",
    "the small-@xmath104 behavior of fadeev s green s function also plays an important role in the analysis of ncgo solutions .",
    "let @xmath202 be the logarithmic potential , and let @xmath203 where @xmath204 is the euler constant .",
    "finally let @xmath205 nachman ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 3.4 ) proves :        following @xcite , chapter 4 , we study the cauchy transform and the beurling operator through the logarithmic potential associated with poisson s equation in two dimensions . for @xmath210 , we may define the logarithmic potential @xmath211 which has the property@xmath212 associated to @xmath17 are the _ _ cauchy transform,__@xmath213 the transform@xmath214 and the _ _ beurling transform__@xmath215 from these definitions and ( [ eq : l ] ) , it is easy to see that @xmath216 where @xmath217 is the identity on @xmath218 , and @xmath219 we have@xmath220 and @xmath221      .",
    "the following estimates on @xmath222 extend the cauchy transform to @xmath33 spaces and are standard consequences of the hardy - littlewood - sobolev and hlder inequalities ( see vekua @xcite or @xcite ,  4.3 ) .",
    "they are used to prove existence and uniqueness of solutions to the @xmath4 problem that defines the inverse problem .",
    "[ lemma : p1]@xmath223(i ) for any @xmath224 and @xmath225,@xmath226 ( ii ) for any @xmath227 with @xmath228 and any @xmath229 , the estimate@xmath230 holds .",
    "moreover , @xmath222 is hlder continuous of order @xmath231 with@xmath232 ( iii ) if @xmath233 and @xmath234 with @xmath235 , then for any @xmath236 , @xmath237    [ rem : p1]since @xmath218 is dense in @xmath238 and @xmath239 as @xmath240 for any @xmath241 , it follows from ( ii ) that if @xmath242 for @xmath243 , then @xmath244 , the continuous functions that vanish at infinity .      for any @xmath247 , lemma [ lemma : p1 ] together with ( [ eq : p-0 ] )",
    "imply that @xmath248 solves @xmath249 in distribution sense .",
    "suppose , on the other hand , that @xmath250 for some @xmath251 and @xmath252 in distribution sense .",
    "it follows that @xmath253 in distribution sense , so that @xmath254 by weyl s lemma .",
